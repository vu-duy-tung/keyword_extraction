    "text": "So many people give the cheesecake factory such a big hype! I don't get it. Decent service, but mediocre food. I've only been here a couple times, so maybe it's not just for me to have such a strong opinion yet. I recent when for a kid's birthday party there. We arrived at 5 pm ( they don't take reservations), there were only 20 of us to which they said It'd be a half hour wait. An hour and fifteen minutes later we are finally seated. The service was great. Very fast paced, they got us what we needed. The cocktails were nice! The bread was just bread, nothing spectacular. I ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta for the main course. It was decent, but I had to order a side of Buffalo sauce and chili flakes. Barely any spice to it. I was rather satisfied with the portion though. Dessert was great of course. Who can go wrong with red velvet and lemon raspberry cheesecake. Overall this place wasn't bad, I just don't see myself coming here anytime soon.",

They brought out the kids meals first, no problem; then came two of the entrees, mine was still not brought out.  I ordered the Hibachi Steak (medium rare), it came out about 4 minutes after the other entrees.  The quality of the steak was aweful, very veiny with fat; also under cooked.   I buy better meat at Costco all day long.  I sent the steak back the next time the manager brought it out, same problem, it was just warmer.  The manager said that it was cooked to the internal temperature specifications to qualify it to be medium rare.  The server took one look at it, and agreed with me that it was still undercooked. They offered to redo it, or make me something else, I declined; I don't want to be the guy who sends food back just for a comped meal.  I'll go back, eventually; but I'll never order a steak there again.",

My husbands birthday, we didn't make a reservation be it wasn't busy so we were seated right away. Ten minutes pass before the waitress takes our DRINK order. Just taking her time, talking to the table next to us, doesn't even look our way. So we wait ten more minutes to get the drinks. (Which were delivered by someone not our waitress) Ten more minutes pass and she still hasn't been back. We got up and left.   Not exaggerating about the times either! Every time. We're never going back. Not sorry",

    "text": "I had a great experience coming here. It's such a casual restaurant that also has its own elegant flair and atmosphere.   Our waitress was very kind and helpful. I don't remember her name, but she always checked on us and was very patient with us when we couldn't decide on what to eat.  The food was definitely delicious. I'm usually not fond of the entrees when I come here because 1) they're supersized and when I use them as \"leftovers\", they get soggy and I can't eat them anyway, and 2) they're usually not the best tasting even at the restaurant. However, I decided to order only small plates / appetizers to satisfy myself.   I ordered the crispy crab bites, which were decadent and had a lightly battered outside. The presentation was nice. It comes with six bites in a small skillet dish and a side of sauce and a lemon.  I shared the fresh basil, tomato and mozarella flatbread with my friend. She got the beet and goat cheese salad. Overall, we finished all of the food and we were still satisfied. The appetizers, in my opinion, taste 10000x better than the entrees.   Now for the good stuff...the cheesecake. After several minutes of skimming through the endless list of various cheesecakes, I finally decided to go with Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake, which, in the words of the Cheesecake Factory gods, it is \"Layers of Moist Chocolate Cake, Chewy Brownie, Toasted Coconut-Pecan Frosting and Creamy Chocolate Chip Coconut Cheesecake.\" Ohhhhh yes...  My lovely waitress put this in a to-go box for me, and it was fresh the whole time I ate it. It was super sweet (which I love) and the coconut paired perfectly with the decadently rich chocolate and toasted pecans. And to top it all off, the brownie and cheesecake-y cream in the center made this cheesecake - eating experience all the more better for me.  I'm definitely coming here again, but this time, for the cheesecake only.",

    "text": "I've eaten at this Cheesecake Factory many times, probably eaten at almost all the locations in Las Vegas. Overall, I'm very much happy with my experiences here.  This chain has one of those menus that can please any palate. It takes quite a while to even go through the whole menu, it's about 6-7 pages long. They have breakfasts, sandwiches, salads, appetizers, pastas, seafood, meat, burgers, and of course, their infamous cheesecakes.  We actually ordered salads, appetizers, and desserts to go on our last visit. I'd have to say if you do come at peak hours, they will be a wait to be seated.   I can't name all the foods I've eaten here, there's just too many. I'd have to say most of them are good and tasty. We've tried their salads recently, and were a bit disappointed. Just lots of wilted lettuce and not enough toppings. I'm not a big fan of their cheesecake, but I think it's because I prefer the denser version. Their other desserts, the Chocolate Truffle Cake and Carrot Cake, very yummy! Actually, all their other non-cheesecake desserts are phenomenal and huge-portioned. Definitely requires sharing!  There's been good service, mediocre, and exceptional service on my visits. Overall, I'd have to say it's always decently good. Usually if it's bad, I remember it.  I have tried to steer clean of chains these days, but Cheesecake Factory will probably always stick out in my mind as a go-to place to please many people because of their food and enormous menu selections.",

    "text": "What a disappointment! I don't mind waiting for a table when it's busy. If I didn't like the wait, I would go elsewhere. But when you are finally seated and then you get to watch servers run around you for 15 minutes and not even one stops to greet you, THAT is very annoying. I finally had to get up, go to the hostess station, and threaten to walk out in 60 seconds if a server didn't show up. Well, that got their attention, or so I thought. Then, the server comes and complains to us (!!) that he was taken out of his section and \"thrown\" at us. Thrown?? Sorry to be a burden, pal. Your comment directly affects your tip unless maybe you don't understand how a fleeting patron-server relationship works. You be nice - I be nice. It's that simple - not a long-term commitment. We haven't been back since and it would take a lot to get us to walk into another Cheesey-cake Factory. Why not just call it the \"Factory\" if that's how you treat people?",

    "text": "I want to start out by saying I LOVE the cheesecake factory. I would give the one in Anaheim, CA (in the Gardenwalk) 5 stars. With that said, I give this specific establishment 2 stars. The service is a hit or miss. Sometimes you will get a server that is right on point but most the time the servers are \"ok.\" The food gets screwed up at this place on a regular basis. One of the mess ups out of many was burned French fries. At an establishment like this I expect high standards. First off the cook was a jerk for even putting it out there to be served. Second the waitress failed by bringing it to us after clearly seeing that it was burned. We had to tell her they were burned (it was obvious) and she didn't even apologize or seem sympathetic she just said ok i'll get you another one, in a quick fast tone. If you alter a dish, they will bring it to you wrong. And i'm not talking about an extreme alteration. I'm talking about asking for a different type of pasta vs. the one it comes with. If they mess up your dish it will come back more screwed up as if to punish you for having the audacity to correct the mistake. Take out is always a guarantee mess up and they always give you less food when you do take out vs. when you sit inside. I am speaking from 3 years of experience with this place. If you can, go to the one in Summerlin they are much better and more on target. its really sad that such an awesome establishment is screwed up and nothing is done to rectify it. I'm not going to list all the messed up incidents from this place because it will turn into a novel. Its a great food chain with wonderful food. There is something for everyone here and you will not be disappointed with the taste of your food, when made properly. I know a lot of flack is given to this place for the high fat and calorie content. I really don't think that people are looking at it from the proper perspective. You need to know they give you huge portions here. The fat and calorie content is based on the huge plate of food you receive. This place is giving you all this food with the intent of being able to have the consumer bring some home for later. You cant possible think that you are supposed to eat all that food in one sitting. The food you get on your plate is way more then what you would get on the appetizer plate. Appetizers are meant to serve 2-4 people and your entree contains more food then that. So I will leave you with that food for thought ;). If you eat the proper portion its really not that bad in fat and calories. Have you ever seen the fat and calories in a marie calendars frozen meal at the grocery store?! Just think, the portion in a Marie Calendar's frozen meal is 1/3 to 1/4 less then what you would receive on your plate at The Cheesecake factory.",

I looked harder at the lettuce. It was actually cabbage!! I couldn't believe I was eating cabbage on half of my burger lol. Anyways, I take it off the burger and continue to eat. At the end when the server took my plate, I asked if that burger is supposed to have cabbage?? She said it's supposed to be a mix. I said weird it says LTO on the menu, I've ordered this 3-4 times before. She couldn't resist that this dish was suppose to still have a mix and maybe they forgot the lettuce. I just told her maybe she should look into it. Got the check and still tipped 20%",

I went in for dinner with my 18 month old daughter and when we got seated the server quickly came and asked for our drinks I asked for a sprite for me and a apple juice with half water no ice for daughter. He immediately went in to asking me if I was ready to order. I asked him for the soup of the day and he said it was chicken tortilla so I looked at my daughter and said soup sounds good and I proceeded to ask the waiter if it was spicy and he said oh yes it's extremely spicy I said OK let me think his response was so do you need another minute? I said mmm no I'll get stuff mushrooms and for her the kids Alfredo sauce I asked if I can get it with chicken he said sure if that's what you want. We waited a few mins no juice yet he had only brought me my sprite. A few more mins passed and he had a tray of bread in his hand I taught that was ours n said thank you but quickly realized it was for the table next to us since that table had bread he dropped it of. After a few mins he realized my daughter did have her juice and said oh let me go get the apple juice. Our food finally came but not once asked how was our food. He definitely asked the lady's next to us how their food taste did everything come out well etc. After a few mins of eating my daughter had it with the high chair and wanted to be carried (just to clarify she wasn't screaming or crying etc she only raised her hands and gave me the sign to get her out) I was carrying her still eating and the waiter comes and points at my daughters plate and says should I pack this to go. I said hmm sure after being shocked by it. As I finished eating he immediately proceed to ask if we wanted the check or any dessert  at the point I was uncomfortable and in tears that all I wanted was the check and to run out! I felt as if the service I got different from his other tables was because I had a child. I felt discriminated for having a child.",

We had 4-cheese pasta which tasted like a pizza with so much flavor, herb-crusted, grilled salmon with broccoli and mashed potatoes that were wonderful, and tempura-battered fish tacos with chipotle sauce, pickled red cabbage, salsa and guacamole that was delicious.  * Complimentary bread at table was warm and fresh, served with large pats of butter * Strawberry lemonade had real strawberry seeds in it, sugar rim on the glass, and wonderful sour flavor.  * Cheesecake to go was packaged with extra whipped cream and plenty of napkins & forks ***CONS*** The only \"con\" was that the waiter mentioned the computers were slow because of a Christmas coupon that was difficult to enter yet many customers were using. I wish we knew about the coupon. I'd say check their website for details, get on their mailing list, or follow their social media accounts for details.",

We said we were under a time constraint and seated  us as soon as she could. She really made our visit! We we're so worried we were not going to have time to stop! Our waiter was David, he was so helpful when we were trying to decide what pasta dish to have! We both had the 4 cheese pasta dish, but she had marinara sauce and I put Alfredo in mine. They were both good. It was a 20 dollar dish, but I don't think it's worth that much. We did have a cheesecake! It was Bananas and cream! We highly recommend!",

    "text": "Calorieake Factory, Henderson, NV  250 lbs - Drawn like fat little moths to our glittering temple....  If you're going to visit a restaurant that more than lives up to its reputation for dietary madness, go on an unrestricted night, because it's stupidly futile to observe gustatory rigor at The Caloriecake Factory. Their well-honed formula will suck dollars from your wallet and pack pounds on your waist.   And it is a successful formula, at least as best I can tell: each dish is savory and well prepared if not totally inspired, and most spill over the sides of large plates. Gracious, competent staff, expensive drinks, and no room for dessert, which you will order anyway.   Chicken Madeira: Heavy and comfortish, with nicely cooked chicken breast slathered in peas, carrots, heavy cream/chicken/cheese sauce, stacked on top of a George Foreman fist sized serving of creamy potatoes. Because this setup is too low carb, Caloriecake adds two standard sized buttery biscuits on top of all this, which is good because I totally didn't get enough bread before the meal. With butter. And beer.   Total calorie weigh-in: 1650 for just the dish alone.   Bacon-bacon burger: perfect sear over hot pink beef. Soft, sweetish french roll, fresh crispy veggies, and a joyfully disgusting amount of cheddar cheese and mayo. Man, what a good burger! Alas, sidekicked by fries with a sadly low crunch halflife. The fries could be better.   Calories: 1500. This is so much naughty fun that it'll come with a hangover.   Caramel Salted Cheesecake: 1000 calories for one slice. I'm laughing as I type this.   Back on program tomorrow. The Caloriecake Factory adds just enough pleasure to your guilty to keep busting diets like belts. Go enjoy. Occasionally.",

Our most recent experience was a Saturday night during dinner time with a group of 10. We understand that makes it more difficult, but the restaurant didn't handle it correctly. We were told the wait for a table would be 45-50 minutes, but we're not seated until over an hour and twenty minutes elapsed. The worst part was that it was clear that the restaurant was not properly staffed for a Saturday night. They had an entire section of tables empty while the lobby was full of people waiting.  We suspect that the kitchen was understaffed because f he amount of time it took to get food out. Again, food was delicious and waiter was great but the mismanagement of the staffing is almost enough to make me not want to come back.",

After about 5 minutes I managed to flag him down and ask for sugar...took about another 5 minutes to get that.  Coffee was cold.  Tried to flag him down but would pass our table quite quickly, finally got his attention and said it would be about 5 minutes there was a new pot of coffee brewing...so now we've been sitting close to 30 minutes and STILL have no cheesecake, my daughter is done with her chocolate milk and I'm still waiting for my coffee...  he now comes out with my coffee and no creamer, I ask for creamer...when he comes back with the creamer...he plops it down on the table and states, \"are you okay ma'am, you don't seem okay?\"  I tried to give him the short version of this and his response was, well i'm sorry but as you can see I'm very busy....i state...but all we ordered is cheesecake and after 30 minutes we STILL don't have that.   It was fairly uncomfortable...what was supposed to be a treat for my kids and I turned into this uncomfortable, unnecessarily frustrating situation.",

It was nice that the food tasted as good as it looked. The taste, texture and presentation were spot on. The atmosphere was great a little noisy however that's too be expected at times.  Also spoke to manager that was on duty that evening agin polite, cretinous and happy to get our feedback.    We loved it.  will definitely come back.   All this being said I wish to say to the people who gave bad reviews shame on you!  In my opinion some of you were simply trying to get a free meal. I am glad you didn't get it until you have worked in the food service business you have no right to complain.  Just because you have had a bad day there is no reason to take it out on someone who has a very difficult job dealing with people like yourself",

Since 2 nights ago we spent over $18 wasting money at China Tango across the street on soup and bad beef, I felt it relevant to tell the yelp world that Cheesecake Factory has a decent happy hour.  The bad: It is from 4-6 PM.  This was the one day in 2 years of living near CF that Eric R. and I both were home before 6.  He was on the phone with a friend from 5:15-5:45 when I finally asked \"happy hour or not?!?!?\"  We got there at 5:47 and our bartender Sam was cool and patient with Eric (he gets grumpy when hungry and wanted bread and a BIG water glass.  He says CF discriminates against water drinkers because my iced tea glass can eat his water glass).  With a big debate between 2 or 3 appetizers, Sam assured us they, unlike the evil elephant bar, give FULL appetizer portions for the $5 price.  We ordered 3: chicken potstickers, shrimp summer rolls, and tamale corn cakes sans sour cream.  Full portions they were.  Lots of food, multiple dishes, and my tea = $18.  Nyah Nyah, China Tango!  Therefore, when hungry near CF before 6 PM, meander to the bar area and have yourself a hearty meal at the hour of our grandparents.  There are deals on drinks too.",

We started with a Caesar salad and some lettuce wraps. Salad was very basic, but flavor was amazing. Perfect start. We had the portobello mushroom, garlic, ginger wraps. So amazing. Mushrooms sauteed to perfection. My boyfriend was very happy with the start of our meal.   We had the steak with medallions off this skinnylicious menu and we also had the chicken Alfredo.  The steak on our plate was amazing. Mashed potatoes with asparagus, roasted tomatoes, and steak medallions all layered on top made a perfect combo. Steak was cooked medium rare as requested. Juicy chicken and perfect al dente noodles mixed with the amazing flavor of the Alfredo sauce.   So happy. I also ordered a strawberry daiquiri. It was blended all the way through with no ice in the bottom like I experience from most places. Deliciously fresh flavor with just a hint of rum.   We had a slice of caramel cheese cake to finish it all off. Dinner was amazing. Great date night. Boyfriend was happy. So I am extremely happy.",

The cheesecakes are sold by the entrance, where you can purchase whole cheesecakes or slices. The pricing for them was surprisingly high. Some of the whole cheesecakes ranged from $20 to $50 or more. The slices were $7 to $9, which are small in length, but a lot taller than the normal cheesecake you would find somewhere else so the slices are still very fulfilling. When we first came in, the hostess wasn't very welcoming, but the servers were great throughout the entire time we dined there! They were attentive and friendly. The food was awesome, it was freshly cooked and hot. The wait time for the food wasn't long at all, approximately 10 minutes. Overall, I do recommend trying this restaurant.",

Yes, it's a bummer not to indulge in their red velvet cheesecake at the end of the meal, but you don't always have to eat cheesecake just because it's the name of the place.  The Skinnylicious menu has many items to choose from that can be made even cleaner.  I'm a big fan of the turkey burger, ordering it protein-style (without the bread), hold the mayo.  The side salad it comes with is good with its balsamic vinaigrette dressing, too.  The b/f and I had lunch there today and he had grilled chicken breast with brown rice and broccoli, also very clean.

First I tried Caesar's palace but it was ridiculously busy so we drove all the way out to Henderson.  Would we like patio seating?? Sure why not, there are heaters outside. It was kind of a cool evening, but the heater really helped keep us warm and the ambiance sitting outside was actually fantastic, with the music playing around the village was a nice touch!  I dont' know why I stray from my Chicken Chipotle pasta because whenever i do, i am never satisfied! I ordered the Lemon-Garlic Shrimp pasta on the Skinnylicious menu. There really isn't any sauce accompanied with this dish so I asked the server for SOME kind of sauce for this... I think she brought me out some alfredo or something. It still wasn't very good. The shrimp were quite large though but this dish just didn't do it for me.  I must just stick with my Spicy Chicken Chipotle pasta!  Hunnie Bunnie ordered her Mac n Cheese though and enjoyed it very much! And the Red Sangria hit the spot!  Our server was really nice too - Hunnie Bunnie even asked me why she ALWAYS had a smile on her face like that! I told her it's cuz it's her JOB!",

    "text": "I had the chicken salad sandwich with the side salad.  The sandwich was cut into very narrow portions maybe 1 inch by 3 or so inches long.  I saw a lot of tomato and lettuce between those little strips of bread and very little chicken salad.  Hard to eat without it spilling out all over the place.  The chicken salad itself was very disappointing.  Very bland with virtually nothing in it. And that poor side salad - looks like a bagged salad mix of baby greens and other lettuces that came to me looking like the dressing had been poured on it and it had sat awhile,   it was completely wilted and limp.  Very unappetizing. I wound up eating part of my husband's Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich which was pretty good.  We decided to split a key lime cheesecake which is very good.   I think this restaurant's forte is in the desserts.",

I get that it was a combination plate hence the extra small portion. The Herb Crusted salmon was dry and a little burnt.

Our waitress Brittany  H was by far the worse and rudest waitress we have ever had.

    "text": "Husband and I stopped in lastnight for dinner. We were sat immediately. About 5 minutes for our server to appear we order drinks then our meals.  30 minutes in to waiting for our meals to come out a manger comes over and apologizes for it taking so long explaining that the kitchen was confused by \" no garnish on green beans \" claiming they thought it meant no green then something about the green in the bread crumbs...whatever. Still waiting my food comes out I had the chicken Bellagio. The chicken was soggy and pasta was hard and dry where it wasn't covered by soggy chicken. The arugula was wilted down to nothing! So dissapointed at this point I'd rather just go home. Another manager comes over and I mention the hard dry pasta and he brings out new in a bowl and it's swimming in the basil oil again whatever. Then I asked for more of the cream sauce and get it and try to eat something ate some of the chicken and gave up I was pissed and the meal just wasn't good. Sever gave us 2 menus for free cheesecake which was nice but I didn't want dessert I wanted dinner. When we ask for to go boxes I was given another container of both the basil oil and cream sauce...which was nice but I knew I wasn't going to use them. Husband's food he said was great. This is the 3rd time in a year that my meal has been less than great. Normally I just don't say anything but this is pretty ridiculous paying almost $20 for pasta that just gets thrown in the trash. Tried to see if I could salvage anything that was a flop to when I realized the extra container of cream sause was just a container of heavy whipping cream. Our server was great. Will bypass this location from now on.",

I like ordering appetizers cus I can get full off those rather quickly. My absolute favorite is the loaded baked potato tots. It's exactly what it's called and the flavor is delicious! I also like ordering the egg roll sampler -- because I can't choose just one type of egg roll lol.   When I'm on my lunch break with co-workers, we sit at the bar and get quick service. The lunch specials are amazing and so are the prices. I love the crusted Chicken Romano lunch special!   On a normal visit with no time restraints, we get seated anywhere. The most recent time, our server, Sayem, took really good care of us. He had a lot of recommendations and was very friendly. He even had some staff sing to my friend for her birthday! Now that's customer service!   Now for the best part: dessert. Anything is delicious, really. I like the lemon merengue cheesecake, Oreo dream extreme cheesecake, the snickers cheesecake, even the original is yummy! But you have to remember to save room for dessert!",

    "text": "You know, I always thought you can't go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory. Decent prices, good food, pretty big portions. My recent lunchtime visit proved me wrong.  Everyone was seated by the bar area, right next to each other, even though there was plenty of space in the restaurant. This placed us sandwiched between parties having very loud conversations without much wiggle room. Ok, fine.  Next, my date ordered the Lemon Herb roasted chicken. I ordered the mushroom burger. When we got our meals, the chicken was different than it has been in the past. Now, instead of the actual 1/2 chicken on the bone, it was chicken pieces (mostly boneless). Turns out, they'd changed the recipe THAT DAY- and hadn't changed the description on the menu, nor had the server thought to inform us of the change. So he had his mouth set for something in particular and was pretty disappointed when it arrived. Moreover, he ordered the sauteed spinach as a side dish, and it came out dry and barely cooked. They did bring a new side of spinach, but weren't very apologetic about the chicken, just tried to convince him that the new recipe was better.   My burger was fine, just a small slip up as I ordered a side of honey mustard that didn't come until I asked again for it.   We did get dessert to go, and the salted caramel cheesecake was pretty good.   Side note... the Cheesecake Factory was the only place he used his credit card that day. But the next day he got a fraud report- someone used the card info to try to make a large purchase at Cartier. Definitely suspicious.   I don't know that i would return to this location.",

We ate outside (in October) so the temperature was great, a little cold as the night went on but they had heaters which made it very comfortable. I think a couple of the guys sitting directly in front of the heaters mentioned being a little hot...but as a female who is prone to cold it was perfect!  The server was amazing - very engaging and attentive, I always had a full drink and the bread kept on coming throughout the night. The bread is my absolute favorite...I made a conscious decision to get a salad so I could eat as much bread as I wanted and not feel (too) bad about it.   I ordered the Caesar Salad with Chicken and it was amazing. The chicken was real, fresh, grilled and seasoned chicken breast (as opposed to pre-cut pre-cooked chicken slices that most places use) and the lettuce / dressing was perfect. Croutons were a little interesting - more soft \"bread\" like than I'm used to but no big deal.  Everyone's plate was practically licked clean by the end of the meal. Dessert was amazing (obviously), and overall just a great dinner. I've been to a couple Cheesecake Factory restaurants in different cities and while they are all usually pretty good, this location stands out to me as the best.",

Hubby and I usually share an appetizer and then two cheesecakes. Our favorites include any of the egg rolls, fried Mac and cheese balls and lettuce wraps. And for dessert either the Reese's, the Oreo, the S'more or the the Chocolate Hazelnut (although there are a TON more awesome options)!  Another cool factor, if you have a baby they give you complimentary plate of banana slices. Who knew?! My baby boy certainly enjoyed those.",

The Cheesecake Factory is my FAVORITE restaurant, I am always at the location in Los Angeles which is where I'm from.   Since it was a Friday night it was about a 30-minute wait and I got there around 6:15 PM. There were a lot of parties waiting - for graduations, and also it's Father's Day weekend. The 30 minutes went by quick though, as I was looking through the menu and picking out a cheesecake to order for dessert in their display. 30 minutes is such a nice waiting time, and didn't seem that long especially because the one I go to in LA has a wait time that goes almost 2 hours! It's crazy.   I ordered a strawberry lemonade with a Chicken Marsala with Mushrooms - it was in a wine sauce with bow tie pasta around it! It was delicious and I loved the plating. My uncle got the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta with shrimp and chicken and it was so yummy. Not too spicy at all!  We also ordered the carrot cake cheesecake. I liked it. I've tried almost every cheesecake and this just crosses it off my list! Took two bites and had to take it to go because I was too full.   Our waiter Brittany was very attentive and nice and checked up on us! Definitely a plus when waiters/waitresses come and check on us every so often rather than waiting for one to come by.   Wish it wasn't so hot outside, maybe next time I'll sit outside and enjoy the view! (And all the cars driving by lol).",

The food was ok, a little on the salty side.  She didn't even fill up pour water, we were left on the table for awhile till she came back, when she filled out water it was when we were paying. I hope she gets some training it gets less tables so she can improve service. As for everything else, waiting time on a weekend was 1+ hour. Anyone visiting, service is super slow, so if you are visiting don't come here many more places to explore in Vegas.",

There is something for everyone on their giant menu. I ordered the Cuban sandwich. While is was super sized the quality was not up to pare. The  Cuban cafe off of the 215 and Eastern has the real deal. The other 5 guests all enjoyed their fare. The selections of cheese cakes were amazing and New York quality.

    "text": "Who says that Cheesecake Factory has to be busy with long waits? Who says you can't find something somewhat healthy at a Cheesecake Factory?  Nutrition wise, I've been trying to clean it up for the last 10+ weeks. Sometimes eating meals prepped at home can be a bit of a grind.  So, it's good to eat out every once in awhile to break up the monotony. I recently met up with the gf and a friend for lunch here. I discovered their Skinnylicious menu a couple of months ago, so I knew I'd find something clean. Just a reminder, this is a Cheesecake Factory and that means big portions.  Their Skinnylicious menu is no different.  You can get a range from salmon, turkey, lean steak, and chicken off their healthier side of the menu. But don't expect super low calories due to the portion size.  My advice, split your meal.  But for me, I'm going to be all I can be and eat all I can eat...in moderation that is.  If you do that, then expect a calorie range between 490-590.  Still...this isn't too bad.  Like the rest of the Cheesecake Factories out there, there's always something for everyone.  Since I've only had something off their Skinnylicious menu at this location, I am not able to comment on the rest of their food.  I have been to other Cheesecake Factories and pretty much tried everything. I have never been disappointed.  Service was great here and ironically, we didn't have to wait too long to be seated and served.  I'll most definitely be back.    YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (417/500)",

We got there at 11:45 and started off with an order of cocktails. I would say that we received our cocktails by noon which for brunch I can understand having to wait a little longer for drinks. We then put our food order in with the server Juliet. Egg rolls, chicken and waffles Benedict, and an omelette. So no exaggeration whatsoever it took literally almost an hour to receive our food. On top of it there were tables that sat around us three to be exact that had been there probably 10 or 15 minutes and received their food at the same time we did and we waited an hour. I am almost sure the server forgot to put in our food and to be honest if that was the case she should've communicated that to us instead she barely even checked on us at the table. Then when we decided to mention that the eggs Benedict came out with the eggs over hard and she clearly stated that's not how they should've come out she offered to pull the plate so they can make another one. Now let's keep in mind we already waited an hour for our food so why would we have a plate pulled to be remade. We felt like we were in inconvenience to our server. She didn't care about our experience because honestly when you go out for a birthday brunch I think what you are paying for is not just the food but the experience of it all!",

    "text": "If you are hungry and not sure what kind of \"food mood\" you are in, the cheesecake factory is your spot! The menu must be at least 10 pages and includes almost every type of food.    Some of my favorites on the menu are the cobb salad, clubhouse sandwich, bbq chicken sandwich, fish tacos, chicken penne pasta, and grande burrito.  I have had almost every type of dessert that they offer and by far my favorite is the snickers cheesecake.    The service at this location has always been excellent and although it gets extremely busy towards dinner time, they are prompt and never have too long of a wait until you sit down.    Overall, I have had nothing but great experiences and delicious food at Cheesecake factory and I recommend it if you are looking for a wide variety of food and large portions for a reasonable price.",

We got there early 6pm but I'm warning you, if you see a line, get back on Yelp and find another place to go or commit yourself to waiting double or triple the time they tell you. Some may think the food is worth the wait, but it's Las Vegas- there are many, many restaurants to choose from.   Everyone in my party complained about the lighting and I noticed people at other tables using their cellphone lights to read the menu. The general experience was so annoying we took our cheesecake home. We had someone in town and I regret spending two hours there. Our server was so good it probably deserves another star, but the first impression really ruined it for me.",

While the service was great, the food left a little to be desired.  We started with the crab and artichoke dip. This was served with buttered pieces of toast. The dip was just drowning in oils and grease. It was like dipping grease into grease, not very good in my opinion.  For our main corse I ordered the chicken madeira. For being the most famous dish, it was not really what I had my expectations set for. It was a great dish none the less and was prepaired flawlessly. The chef plated it very beautifully aswell.   My fiance ordered the steak Diane and shrimp scampi combination. Again the presentation was very beautiful and the only critic she had was that the scampi was a bit tangy for her taste.  For desert we ordered the tiramisu and lemon meringue cheesecake to go, both were very good.  We will be coming back here forsure, it was totally worth what we had spent and the items left us very curious about other items on the menu.",

She glanced up at us, then looked back down. No greeting whatsoever! So I said hello there is 2 of us and she never spoke to us. How rude! CCF needs to realize in a huge way that the hostess is your first point of contact to your guests, and if they don't acknowledge or greet your paying customers, well.... Fast forward a month or so we decide to give this location another try (December 6, 2017). We see the same older woman now working with a hispanic looking young girl. Let me say this...the young girl couldn't even speak proper English and had no personality. That's it CCF, get your act together. Hire people on your front line who are personable, friendly and know how to greet the public!! It's not that hard to do!",

The cocktail menu is overrated. I have tried a few cocktails and really didn't like them. This place is about the food for me though, not the drinks. 2 choices of complementary bread...awesome! Every dish I ordered has been good, but I tend to stick to my few favorites most times. Cheesecake is ridiculously good! In fact I hated cheesecake until I first visited a location over 25 years ago and have loved cheesecake ever since. I always order the avocado egg rolls every time. Always awesome! Service is always great at every location I've been including this one. Outside patio is awesome to dine at on a date. Love this places location because it's so close to where I live. I can't get out of this place without spending $80 for me and my girlfriend. A little expensive, but I feel as if it's mostly justified. Cheaper lunch specials would be nice. The one and only thing I don't like at CF is their side salad. Poor thing to call a salad to me, but once again I don't care because I love this place so much and never disappointed. This is the smallest CF location I've been to, but I'm from Chicago where their locations are quite large. Wait times are reasonable at this location which I love. Back home I would have to wait at least an hour no matter what time or day I went. Will go back to this location over and over until the end of time.",

Even the lady sitting at the next table who ordered a less ornate salad quipped, \"I wish I would have ordered that salad.\" My wife had the Thai Coconut Lime Chicken with brown rice. She stated she could taste all the spices, with her dish looking like a picture as well. Speaking of pictures, why don't they have pictures of their cheesecake? I told the waiter I needed to look at the pictures on line on my phone before ordering 2 pieces to go. The Tiramisu cheesecake was outstanding.  The new Cinnabon flavor not so much-the layers looked good but way too sweet. Mike our server was very attentive and would request his section again on our next visit!",

    "text": "I really dig this place. It presents a lively atmosphere with huge portions of food that are reasonable for the prices you pay. Don't be alarmed by the $14 cheeseburger, it's a nice portion and higher quality ingredients than your average chain restaurant. The cheesecakes are amazing, and they even have an Atkins-friendly low carb cheesecake that's made with Splenda and a crushed nut crust! It's crazy good.   Why do I frequent this restaurant? They have an understanding of special food and diet requests. I live a low carb lifestyle and it's so easy to make substitutions here. Salad, broccoli, spinach or green beans instead of fries? No problem. No bun? They'll lettuce wrap it! My new \"thing\" is to get the chicken pasta with spinach instead of pasta. Yes, the kitchen will easily accommodate special orders. It might take a lot longer to get your food (my last visit there resulted in a wait time of nearly 55 minutes from the time I placed my order 'til the food arrived), but at least the cooks get it right.   Minus a star because of three problems: 1. The usual slow service: it shouldn't take nearly an hour for food to come out of the kitchen when the restaurant is 3/4 full 2. The always dirty and gross bathrooms: Yuck, clean up more often, please! 3. The tables: if you get stuck at a tiny one, get ready for the nosy snobs next to you to be all up in your eatin' business.",

First time didn't expect an hour wait & the hostesses were not polite about the wait.    The second time we expected to wait an hour for a table, not wait an hour to talk to a hostess.  When we approached the hostess stand to put our name down, 3 young ladies standing there , 2 doing nothing.   I asked one girl (that was not doing anything) how long the wait was, she pointed to the girl doing something, and said ask her.  I tried multiple times to ask the other girl, but she ignored me.  Even when she was doing nothing she continued to ignore.   We left the second time & debating if there will ever be a third.   Did finally make it back, but doubt a return.  $150 for 5 people for burgers & 3 pieces of OK cheesecake.  No alcohol!  Food was ok, great service though. Not worth the hassle for the $$",

We ended up scoping out a high table and swooping in. The waitress (wish I remembered her name) was super friendly and available. When I asked for lemons for my water, she brought a full saucer! As far as food, we ordered from the Skinnylicious menu. He got the salmon, and I got the chicken taquitos. I didn't try his, but he was happy with it. I loved the taquitos; not only were they only $5.95, but they were quite flavorful. I'd say it was a successful dinner! :-)  Tip: If you've never been here and hate deciding from a large menu, you will be overwhelmed. If you like a lot of options and delicious cheesecake, this is a must!",

The beading on the chicken was nice and crunchy while the chicken was tender and juicy. Angel hair pasta covered the top rolled into a semi-compact \"bun\" that was easily spread out an onto the edges of the pizza style \"crust\" (breaded chicken).  The pasta had just the right amount of alfredo sauce. Underneath that was hints of pasta sauce for that \"pizza\" effect. Yes, they did mix well. The dish was heated just right and one bite led to another.  Had a slice of lemon-raspberry cheese cake. Although I usually prefer any one of several other flavors I took a chance on this one and was pleasantly surprised with the balanced taste.  Yes, warm bread was served as expected and tasted fresh as usual.  Service was good as usual even when the section I was sitting in became more and more busy as I was eating.  Another poster mentioned one of my initial concerns involving the \"massive menu\" - too many items to choose from. Easy to get lost in the menu while worrying about food quality. However, as I stated, my main dish was tops in taste.  Just had water, but due to the great meal I left wanting more.  Great job Cheesecake Factory!",

That's probably True, but everything I've ever tried has been delicious, so I don't care. :) Also, this location usually doesn't have a very long wait, which is always nice.   One thing we've noticed though is their servers all try really hard on the customer service side of things, almost to the point where it's over the top. We've had three different servers who, for lack of a better word, bugged us all night. Constantly checking in to see how our food was, refilling glasses that are only 1/4 gone, and generally hanging around the table. Similarly, every time we have eaten here, they have offered us dessert as soon as my boyfriend finished his meal, even though I still had 2/3 of my meal left. I know he's a fast eater and I'm a slow eater but checking in about dessert 2-3 times when I already said I'm not done eating is a quick way to drive me mad. That was a bit weird and I don't know if it's just those servers, or the management at that location.   Overall though, we like the food, the price is fair, and its better than waiting in line at the Summerlin location or paying Strip prices.",

    "text": "Everyone knows Cheesecake Factory.  You are going to find an extensive menu and you'll have to decide what you are in the mood to eat.  Depending on the day and time, you may have a wait.  Attempted to go here on a discount cheesecake night and the expected wait was 45 minutes to an hour.  I'm not sure how long it was because we bailed after 20 minutes.  Back to the last time my family and I ate here this past week.  The food looks amazing.  (See my pictures). The taste is OK.  The side salad was supposed to have balsamic dressing and I tasted none, so I left it.  The chicken salad sandwich is delicious!  Should have gotten the full size instead of the lunch special, as the soup was also only OK.  The men in my family enjoyed their burgers, which was big enough for my teen to also have for dinner.  Daughter liked, not loved, her grilled cheese.",

The wife and I met a couple of friends here for her birthday dinner and only waited about 15 minutes before being seated (at 6:15pm). We started with waters all around and a couple of cocktails: the strawberry martini and the factory peach Bellini, both drinks were very good 5/5.   For appetizers we ordered the avocado spring rolls 5/5.  The bread was also delivered with butter and the wheat loaf is always delicious.   For entree's we ordered the Orange Chicken: deep fried pieces of chicken breast covered in sweet and spicy orange sauce accompanied with rice (white or brown) and veggies, usually lots of snow peas and some carrots 5/5, shrimp jambalaya delicious flavors 5/5, shrimp pasta 4/5, and the chicken salad with extra chicken 4/5.  For desserts we tried the white chocolate raspberry 5/5 and the Craig's crazy carrot cake cheesecake 5/5! Honestly I think all of heir desserts are 5/5!  Service was on top of everything and even came to sing 8-D.  Thank you for a nice birthday dinner!",

Stayed for 2 hours had a couple glasses of house Chardonnay, $5.95 & yummy. Going to go back and do another Happy, this time with the food.

Fortunately we were able to be seated within 20 min after checking in twice to make sure we weren't called. I'm grateful they turned down the music cause I couldnt hear my family speaking. We ordered egg roll and calamari and the sauce was amazing with it. We ordered fettuccini, kids pizza, pork chop and veggie burger. All of which was just okay. Fettuccini was bland. Pizza did not have enough sauce, pork chop was overpowered by the Apple sauce. Veggie burger was different from last time where it consisted of beets while this time it was beans and brown rice. The server was under the weather and very curt but still friendly. Over all it was okay. Not a place I would go often but maybe once or twice year.",

You will be treated 'like royalty' here and the food is super-fresh (gotta try those Summer Shrimp Spring Rolls while they last!!) and the Cob Salad we had filled me up (and that's not easy to do since I have a big appetite and love to chow down!). Do yourself a favor....If you find yourself hungry in Henderson, stop on into the Cheesecake Factory for Lunch/Dinner! You will not be disappointed!!",

    "text": "I've only been here a handful of times since I'm not in the Green Valley area often, so it's typically to meet other friends halfway or the location of birthday dinners, etc. I haven't been a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory for several years now, however, I've been impressed during my last two visits.  One big factor of my newfound respect is the addition of their SkinnyLicious menu. The primary reason I stopped dining with them was because of their calorie-heavy menu (they have pasta dishes that exceed 2,000 calories!). The menu features a list of items that were specially curated to not exceed 490 calories for appetizers and 590 calories for entrees and some items from their regular menu that happen to be under those thresholds. However, as I'm sure you've guessed, the portion sizes are cut dramatically. They apparently don't know how to cook filling and healthy dishes.  Off their SkinnyLicious menu, I've tried the Santorini Farro Salad (farro, cucumbers, tomatoes, beets, red onions, feta cheese, tzatziki, and vinaigrette) and Chicken Samosas (crispy wrappers filled with spiced chicken with cilantro sauce). Both surprisingly delicious and not overly terrible for you. The salad was ridiculously small and there were four tiny samosas. The prices weren't bad, but it's sad considering the fact that those dishes were still loaded with calories and fat.  I was surprised that their Fried Calamari (served with garlic dip and cocktail sauce) was really good. Also, I've had their Barbecue Ranch Chicken Salad (grilled chicken, avocado, tomato, grilled corn, black beans, cucumber, and Romaine) with the dressing on the side. It was tasty and it was such a large portion that I couldn't finish it.  The SkinnyLicious menu is great, however, it's really hard to love a place that serves dishes that have more calories than you should consume in a day. It's a shame that a lot of diners are really oblivious to restaurants' nutrition information and obviously, restaurants don't want to be transparent about it. So, although I don't advocate dining at these restaurants, if you do, as I'm sure I will in the future (even though I won't want to), definitely order off the SkinnyLicious menu.  Side note: their Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake (seasonal) and many other cheesecakes are really good. Share it with 1-2 people and don't think about the calories.",

They never take a reservation for any reason. I wish they did. Wait times; u will have a 30 minute or more wait outside the restaurant. I personally think they should offer a discount to regular customers or locals, on entrees or specialty meals. I would come more often if it werent for the high price tab. It is also very expensive to get a drink at this place. Therefore this can be an expensive date night",

I have never had a bad meal at Cheesecake Factory and have been coming to multiple locations ever since the chain opened. My favorite dish is a toss up between the Chicken Madeira and the Shrimp Scampi. Imagine my delight when they started the combination meal so I can get both. I love the brunch menu. The Lemon Ricotta Pancakes are the best and the bacon is perfect. My favorite appetizers are the fried zucchini, Dynamite Shrimp, and the new pork belly sliders. Love the bread of course.  Make the fried pickles a separate appetizer please! Love 'em!!!  Love every cheesecake I've ever tried.  Service has always been very good, especially in Henderson. They really hustle here without seeming to be rushed. The servers are very nice.",

I've had my fair share of items over the years, and there's always something for someone. What keeps me coming back are the BUFFALO BLASTS.   I've since tried a couple items I've never had, such as the loaded tater tots. Not the typical tater tots, and they were good!  My fave part about cheesecake factory is, no matter which location, the food is consistent. It tastes the same EVERY TIME i've gone.   And who doesn't love free bread. I love the brown bread.",

We were here at around 11am, and I had already decided on getting breakfast. Of course, on display as you walk in are all of their amazing looking cheesecakes. I was 'this' close to just saying 'forget the breakfast, bring on the cheesecake!!!'.  Our waiter was awesome, and very professional. He was not wearing a nametag, but he must be the tallest guy there. I ordered an Eggs Benedict with regular bacon, as I always do, and my husband go the Spicy Chicken Sandwich. What I loved about both of these is that the condiments were in small bowls on the plates, rather than dealing with messy ketchup bottles. The lettuce and tomato for the sandwich were off to the side, so they stayed nice and cold. Nice touch. My bacon was not super crispy, but overall the benedict was pretty good.   We had no room for a cheesecake, but saw the monstrosity that the couple next to us got. It was enormous!!! But they finished it. Ha ha. Next time I think that I will come here just for a  piece of cheesecake. The problem will be deciding which one.",

She invited me to eat Cheesecake Factory because she was craving it and staring at the menu while she was studying. So we ended up going there after my shift at work.  Friday night. Busy night. We pull up and everyone's waiting to get seated. A whole bunch of parties ahead of us, but there were only 2 of us so the wait was about 30 minutes. Not bad. We waited. Got seated. On a tiny tiny table.  Our server was quick and attentive. His name was Sayem or Sam I think? I'm not too sure but he's indian. I think..... Anyway, good thing we shared appetizers! We got four different plates. A house salad with mixed greens, cucumber, tomatoes, and balsamic vinaigrette. Fried Mac 'N Cheese balls--macaroni put into a ball, deep fried, with creamy marinara and parmesan cheese sauce. Fried calamari (self explanatory)--however it's paired with cocktail sauce (I prefer marinara). Buffalo blasts-- chicken marinated in buffalo sauce wrapped in a wonton and deep fried. However, ours was SO breaded and there was literally a tiny bit of chicken in there......   Overall, our server made the experience an awesome one! :) Ask for him!",

It is always better to overestimate on a wait time. The seat was not wiped off prior to me being seated which on a cosmetic and cleanliness level was a minus. Order the Farfalle...with Roasted Garlic. Chicken was a little dry, but the mushrooms had a nice flavor. Did get a shocking bite of garlic which was very unpleasant. My server, Claudia V, was perfect. Volunteered to box my food up for me which is a bonus service. Ordered the Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake which was yummy, but not my favorite. It's more tangy than sweet so if you prefer that, than you'll enjoy this. Cheesecake Factory always nails their cheesecake flavors, I will give them that. P.s. it's a little dim inside so if you have a hard time reading, you may need to bring a light source.",

I have a very timid palate, but I ordered items that I normally wouldn't and I was really impressed with the food quality. We ordered chicken taquitos and what were essentially mozzarella sticks for starters, the cheese was fine but the taquitos were excellent; I normally avoid onions and cilantro, but I ate it up greedily; these were the 2nd best thing about the meal. My son ordered jambalaya and I ordered a chicken Parmesan that was the size of the plate, thin and delicious. The angel hair pasta that was with it was some of the best I've ever had; a deliciously creamy texture and perfectly flavored, I could've eaten a bowl of it and been happy. The jambalaya was delicious as well.   The cheesecake however, was, somewhat underwhelming. Nothing wrong with it, but I expected to be blown away by it. For the dish being the namesake of the restaurant, I had expected something more memorable. Considering the fairly high prices (apps, entrees, desserts and soft drinks for two was about $120), I give it 4 stars, but the food was great.",

It adds a more intimate atmosphere and makes the room feel more luxurious. The music they play definitely makes the experience a lot better. It can be quite busy every night as it is perfect for a casual dinner or more special dinner. The servers have always been great and very friendly!   The menu offers you so many different choices. My personal favorites is the fried calamari for appetizer, of course the delicious complimentary bread basket, the herb crusted salmon and mashed potatoes with asparagus and a lemon sauce, I made the mistake of switching it up one night and got a rice dish, nothing compares to the salmon, then finish it off with, of course, cheesecake! The classic strawberry cheesecake is not too sweet and fresh, but still satisfying for any sweet tooth.   I was always come back and have had great memories every single visit.",

It took a very long time for our food to arrive. When it finally came, my chicken was burnt and potatoes were cold. I asked the server to send over a manager. The manager made excuses that the recipe for this dish had recently been changed and the kitchen still hadn't gotten the hang of it. She said \"its supposed to be served dark, but not THAT dark.\"  Better to just apologize rather then tell me your kitchen doesn't know how to properly cook your dishes. She said she liked the old recipe and didn't know why they changed it.    I sent it back and by the time my new dish arrived everyone else had already finished their meal. This time it wasn't cooked enough! UGH. I just took it to go, since I didn't want everyone else to have to sit there while I struggled through rubbery chicken skin. Truly unappetizing!  I tried to crisp it up the next day and it was still disgusting. I'm very disappointed because this used to be my favorite dish. Also this put a big damper on our birthday celebration. We were so disgusted that we took our cheesecake to go (not even a comp piece for his b'day).  I hope they can get their act together since this is my son's favorite chain.",

I mean I'll give it to them on the chicken pot stickers fairly tasty item but it wasn't any better than day a ghengis grill where it costs half as much right? My gf got the skinny Asian chicken which she wasn't very impressed by at all and for something on a low cal memo the peon was ridiculous but I digress. My option was the Baja chicken tacos with rice and beans again I wouldn't mind the price of the meal was worth it but the tacos and rice had no flavor and the only hot sauce the carried was Tabasco which is awful on a taco. So needles to say we were both looking for a dessert to really pull the meal together and is the cheese cake factory so hell why not we ordered an oreo cheese cake and I was really excited for it to come only to be let down I wanted to give this place one star but our server was great and very attentive so I the an extra one in for him. Ladies and gentlemen there ate plenty of places in Vegas to spend your money on great food don't waste it here.",

To start off the charges us for the bread when I thought it came free with the meals but I'm not sure about that one. Also we ordered tacos and the side we decided on was rice and corn NO BEANS, and they gave us rice and beans. On that note it was also cold.. And then my dad ordered fish and chips and instead of coleslaw he asked for double fries and they didn't give him that, they gave him coleslaw... And the last thing was my mom ordered steak medallions on the skinnylicious menu and they're was literally barely anything on that plate. This entire experience was just so upsetting and I hope you tell your location staff to next listen to what we ask for next time. Thank you for your time.",

Our server, Deanna displayed unprofessional and inexcusable behavior towards my husband and I as well as our 4 guests. After we were seated we were greeted by our sever who unfortunately was about to leave for the day. She introduced Deanna as our new server while she made sure we had plenty to drink before she left. Deanna proceeded to take our food order and was very vocal when our friends ordered the crispy chicken sandwich with an extra order of fries. They told her that they were sharing the sandwich to which Deanna replied loudly \"that's it ? You're sharing a sandwich?\" She seemed irritated and it continued when my husband and I ordered the crusted chicken romano with a salad to share. She commented again \"you're sharing too?\" Then to cap it off when our friend's 5 year old told her father that she wasn't hungry she stated \"so she isn't eating anything!\"   Honestly, I found her behavior apalling and I have no problem taking my business to Lucille's and/or Claim Jumpers which are both just across the street. The food here is good but I don't need to be shamed for sharing a dinner that is actually large enough for 3 people. We will not be back anytime soon!!!",

    "text": "First off, I'm a huge fan of The Cheesecake Factory and have been eating at different ones religiously throughout the years, but my experience at this location was a gigantic disappoint, to say the least.   When I suggested The Cheesecake Factory to one of my friends, he said that the food wasn't great and overpriced at that. Since this has always been one of my favorite places to go, of course I had to argue with him. Determined to prove him wrong, I insisted that we go here for dinner.  We went in, put our name down on the wait list, and went outside for a cigarette. Now this is a normal practice, and typically restaurant hosts will always check outside for the next table to be seated if nobody answers their call from inside, especially if the waiting area inside is full! They didn't even try to look for us when we were literally standing just outside of the door (which we had also let the hostess know before stepping out), and it took a leaving customer to inform us that we were up for a table. We ended up having to sit outside because they sat somebody else at our table.  Our waitress was friendly (which was the only pro of the night). I ordered a rare steak Diane and herb crusted salmon. When the food came out, my steak was COLD. Not even room temperature, but cold. When I informed our waitress, she had the audacity to tell me that in order for them to cook it rare, they could only throw it on the grill for a couple seconds which meant that it was normal for it to be cold. Are you seriously kidding me? I don't ever eat anything BUT rare steak, and I have yet gone to a restaurant and been served a cold one. Furthermore, if you don't know how the steak Diane at The Cheesecake Factory is, the steak is actually thinly sliced into little pieces, about three inches in diameter. So it doesn't take much for the meat to get heated up. As a reference, I have ordered this dish before at several other Cheesecake Factories, and not once have I encountered this problem.   At this point I was just bummed out, but my friend insisted on complaining to the manager, so that's who we asked for. It was a good 15 minutes before anybody walked past us or any of the tables around. We had to asked for a manager twice before our waitress came back with my steak re-cooked. The manager lingered in the background behind her and they both left after she gave me my steak. At this point we just asked for the check and a to-go box since our appetites were gone. I didn't even bother checking my steak to see if it was any good this time around.  I didn't bother mentioning, but my herb crusted salmon was exceptionally bland. I had to season the life into it with salt and pepper myself. At least it was decently cooked, and with how they treated my steak, I didn't even want to complain about anything else. I don't remember what my date had to eat, but it's safe to say that we were just as impressed with his dish as we were with mine, which was not at all.  I'm a very easy-going and forgiving person, so for me the big issue isn't necessarily the poor cooking, but the service and management (as I've seen other reviewers have pointed out). They should have just fixed the problem when it was presented, instead of making excuses. We were not being rude or unfriendly (in fact quite the opposite, despite of everything) and it's not like I was asking for the meal to be comped or discounted. In addition, I've never seen worse management skills. The manager never bothered to introduce himself or ask us how we were doing, even though we had specifically asked for him. Everything was a huge hassle and they made me feel like I was someone who was super picky or asking too much.  My friend is right in that The Cheesecake Factory is a relatively pricey place to eat and based on my experience at this location, it is definitely not worth it. Worst $50 of my life, which doesn't even include tax and tip. It's a good thing our waitress was at least friendly and smiled through the night, because her other service skills were quite lacking. I don't even know how the manager was hired, because he showed no managerial skills whatsoever. I was so embarrassed that I insisted on going to eat here and defended this place when everything turned out to be horrible.   This particular Cheesecake Factory is definitely not up to par. Avoid at all costs.",

We visited on a busy Mothers' Day weekend and the service was sub-standard. First, the server forgot our appetizer and brought it out only after we asked in confusion because our main entrees came out while we we waited for the fried calamari. Second, no refills were offered for our soda. Third, our take-home boxes was missing one of the entrees which probably didn't get boxed in confusion. Finally, I realized that the Cheesecake Factory is one of those establishments that calculates the customary 15% gratuity on the dinner + the tax instead of correctly on just the dinner itself. Anyone of these service issues by themselves would not have been a big deal, but all of them combined made our dining experience less than special for us. The only thing saving the Mothers' Day lunch was that the food was delicious.",

    "text": "I'm giving one star strictly based on service. The food is great.   I had just moved to Las Vegas from California and have eaten at multiple Cheesecake Factory locations on many different occasions.   We decided to eat in the bar area rather than wait for a table. We sat down and our server, Melissa N., came up after a few minutes and took our drink orders but didn't ask us if we wanted to eat (we ordered 3 waters and a lemonade). She brought back our waters and walked away. We tried to flag her down for menus but she never stopped. One of us went to the host stand and got menus, 10 minutes later she came back and we placed our order and asked about the lemonade and she said she'd bring it right back and did.   While we were waiting for our food she brought us bread however she forgot bread plates and place settings. We waited for a few minutes and didn't see her so we asked another server if we could have silverware and she promptly returned with silverware, napkins, and bread plates.   Our dinner arrived via food runners and upon inspection 1 of the 3 salads had dressing and one of the sandwiches had mushrooms when we requested there were none. We waited and waited, no Melissa, so we stopped a host who was walking by if she could find her. She finally appeared and delivering another tables food and one of us had to walk after her because she never even checked on us.   She apologized for the mushrooms and said she'd have another one sent right out and also said she'd bring the dressing right back, \"I'll be right back with your balsamic\" however, I previously had asked for ranch.   It took another 10-15 minutes for someone to tell us that the sandwich was almost done. It was a manager and I asked for it to be packaged to-go because everyone was already done eating. We told him about the utter lack of service and he apologized and offered to buy us desert, we accepted. Melissa came back with the sandwich packaged to-go and asked what kind of deserts we'd like, we told her and requested no whipped cream be put on the cheesecake.   She said she'd get them packaged up for us and left the bill. The manager was kind enough to comp the meal but only comped one of the slices of cheesecake after he offered to buy it for us.   We paid the bill and Melissa returned with our cheesecakes, of course one had whipped cream. I would NEVER recommend this location to anyone strictly based on service, the food quality and portions are great but the service is absolutely dismal.   Sherman Oaks, Woodland Hills, Glendale, Redondo Beach, and Thousand Oaks are a few of the Cheesecake Factory locations I've been to and I'd give all of these locations 5 stars all the way around and have no hesitation recommending them to anyone.",

    "text": "My favorite was the Thai chicken wrap appetizer.  Great to share but don't plan on having room for dessert unless there are four of you sharing it. The menu here offers a huge variety. I ventured away from my usual favorite entrees (Meat loaf, asian or one of the pasta dishes) and tried the jambalaya pasta. The flavor was delicious but the chicken was dry,  as was the entire dish. It was probably overcooked. The flavor was so good that I may try it again after getting the waiter's opinion about the norm for this dish.  About the waiter,  he did a great job despite a very busy night. We spent $80 for 2, with alcohol. Norm is more like $20-$25 ea. Recommended",

I have to say this visit was not inspiring.   The Caesar salad is always a favorite and my mini foodie always insists we order it, so that's an automatic.  We started off with an appetizer.  We got the sweet corn tamales and I was a little disappointed, bland despite all the flavors of avocado, parsley, tomato and sour cream, it just gets a two star.  I ordered the shrimp tacos and the side serving of rice was so lame!  Usually I get enough to share so the serving was disappointing.  My little one ordered a pepperoni pizza and this time it was greasy and slimy. YUK.  Overall, I won't be visiting this Cheesecake, I'll stick to Summerlin or the Ceasar's Palace one instead:( Oh, BTW service was good but waiter a bit robotic.",

    "text": "3.5 stars  We've been to this location once and only for cheesecake.  But, in general, we really do like the food at The Cheesecake Factory and sometimes even crave some of the apps and meals here.  But there are a few things that keep us from coming more often.  The good:  The cheesecake is delicious, and there are SO many options.  I want to try them all but usually can't pass up Reese's or Red Velvet and my husband LOVES the Snickers flavor.  And the portion is very large.  I had to bring some of mine home!  The service was friendly and efficient.  When we sat down our server immediately brought us bread, and we thanked him but told him we'd only be having dessert.  He brought our cheesecake quickly, kept our waters filled, and brought the bill promptly.  Don't you hate going somewhere for dessert and waiting like an hour to receive your bill? So glad that didn't happen!   The not-so-good:  This place is just expensive.  Seriously.  Sometimes I wonder - what right do they have to charge these prices?  It's a good chain but our cheesecake cost as much as a small dinner somewhere else!  We knew that going in so it wasn't a surprise but just be aware that cheesecake costs a small fortune here.    The lighting is very dark.  I have excellent vision and I was squinting to see the menu.  It almost made me too tired to eat cheesecake.  But I found it in me to keep going.   I can't STAND the seating.  The table you get can make or break your experience.  They have these HUGE cushy booths that they do give to parties of 2 - I saw it.  But of course we get that small 2 person table crammed between two different parties on that really long booth.  Ugh, I could hear entire conversations of the people on either side of me.  And that awkward moment when you have to turn sideways to get in or leave the booth and hope you're not brushing someone's plate with your rear end... I know I'm making kind of a big deal about this but it really is annoying to me.  Please, spread the tables out more.  Overall this is a restaurant that we enjoy coming to sometimes. They have a really great menu selection of food, drinks and cheesecake.  But it's just a once-in-a-blue-moon thing.",

Audrey was an excellent server recommend the Cajun pasta which was excellent with a spicy kick. The  barbeque chicken salad was incredible which Audrey also recommended.

We've always enjoyed their food and of course the cheesecake. We had a party of 9 on a Friday night. I called early in the week in attempts of making a reservation but they do not take them on weekends.  That was my 1st and main disappointment. I didn't want to have a large group (half kids) waiting long. I told my party to arrive at 7, I arrived about 15 min prior. Our total wait time ended up being about 25 minutes. Not too bad on a Friday night.  We were sat at a beautiful big round table where everyone could see everyone.  We ordered multiple apps and dishes including spinach dip, calamari, tex mex egg rolls, chicken picatta, garlic noodles, sliders, steak, shrimp, and more.  Everything food wise was 4 stars easy. It did take a full on hour before we were eating though. They served us basket upon basket of bread but took forever on the real food.  Service was 3 stars. Our waitress was nice, just overworked and slow.  Cheesecake selections were red velvet, Oreo, Hershey's, and strawberry.  Seriously can I say anything wrong? Of course not.  I will return to Cheesecake Factory. Overall they are a great \"chain\" restaurant.",

Delay on drink refills.  No one checked on us until we were done eating.  And food was ok, but not as good as expected.  My scampi was strange,  fried with a crust rather than sauteed and almost no garlic.   The angel hair was a sticky lump in the center of the plate without any sauce.   Took about 30 seconds to congeal.",

    "text": "I visited this Cheese Cake Factory for a late lunch date.  My recommendation was a mistake.  First we arrived at 2:30 PM and submitted our name to be told it would a 15 to 20 minute wait. I found that to be unacceptable considering the time of the day and considering that the restaruant was far from busy.  We were finally setted and given a menu.  The waitress did arrive at our table in a timely manner.  We both ordered an Ice Tea as a beverage.  She returned timely.  We told her that we needed a few minutes to decide on lunch and she left, returning timely. My date ordered a Crab Cake appetizer, a Chicken Oriental Salad. I an old fashion Burger and Salad combo. My date told the waitress that the Crab Cakes were good, but the chicken in the salad was over cooked and very dry.  My burger was at best etable and the salad small.  So far, just lunch, not so good!    Then we were ask if we wanted dessert and my date ordered the Pumkin Spice Cheese Cake. It was delivered and as she ate the Cheese cake, I noticed a hair in it. I called the waitress over and she offered and it was accepted to get a new piece delivered. It was placed in a take home container.  It was never offered to take the item off the bill, which I felt should ahve been the case. I mean a hair in it?  Issue number two.  We were never ask if we wanted a refill on our Ice Tea. although it was obvious that our glasses had been near empty throught out entree's.    So in a nutshell, we had a less than enjoyable dining experience and the tab? In my opinion, was to expensive. For a simple appetizer, oriental chicken salad. a burger and small-small salad, and two ice teas, came to $52.64.  then add a tradional tip of $12.00, it cost me $63.00 for a lunch!  I doubt that I will recommend or entertain another date at this place!",

The Cheesecake Factory is actually somewhat tasty.   We had a really great server and the food was good and came out fast. Its portions are oversized, absolutely. Like most chains, it is advised to share.   The cheesecake really is fabulous but I'm not chomping at the bit to return here as it is kind of pricy for  chain food.",

Their menu is as big as their portions - it is a ring bound folio.    We have tried a lot of the dishes and it is probably easier to list those that haven't quite lived up to expectations (as that is a shorter list):  The meatloaf sandwich Their brunch menu (just order from the regular menu)  Our favorite dishes are the miso salmon and the bang-bang chicken & shrimp.  My sister in law ate their calamari about 20 times on a recent vacation.  Their passion fruit iced tea is great and the complimentary bread basket is excellent.  Our favorite cheesecakes are the dulce de leche & pumpkin (only available for about 4 weeks a year).  The strawberry shortcake is very good if you don't feel like cheesecake.  This location is great of you are staying on the strip & have a car (and don't want to wait a long time at the location at the back of Caesars Mall in Caesars Palace).",

    "text": "I came here with two other friends to celebrate one of their birthdays. One of us does not do well with fish or anything too exotic, so the Cheesecake Factory was a safe bet.   The portions here are large, bordering on insane. Some items are average in price to quantity ratio such as the potstickers, but then there are ridiculously big selections such as their chicken nachos. We started with these two appetizers and a few drinks. Looking through their menu is daunting. Flipping through page after page, it all becomes a blur. It took us twenty minutes to settle on our meals.   Many of these plates could easily feed two and my friends did not want to split an entree with me. It definitely made me appreciate their Skinnylicious offerings. All of the items on this separate menu possessed less than 590 calories. It is not like other places that only have a few selections to choose from. No, this was a full blown menu with burgers, salads, pizzas, fish, and more. Looking at this was a task on its own. I ended up getting the Veggie Burger since I am a huge fan of beets. The patty is not like a Boca Burger. It is not condense or have the texture of meat. It is made up of farro, a wheat grain, and the deep burgundy vegetable. After a few bites, I gave up on trying to eat it as a burger and just ate the contents between the bun. It just felt odd to eat all these carbs together. The farro was cooked well and I enjoyed its flavor. It would make for a good salad.   Now comes the real reason to come to the Cheesecake Factory, it is all about their... brownies. I kid, the only reason why I still come back to this establishment is for their cheesecake. The Red Velvet is my go to dessert. The white chocolate curls on the outside makes this treat even more decadent. Too bad, cheesecake does not make for a well balanced meal.",

    "text": "This may be the non-fast-food chain restaurant I have been to the most across the country and in Las Vegas in the last few years...and this location is by far my favorite. Just off the freeway in the Green Valley area of Las Vegas, lots to do in the area before or after eating, and no crazy tourists (like the one in Forum Shops) or  nouveau riche with entitlement issues (like the Summerlin location). Do I exaggerate? Yes. Is it completely unTrue? No. Admit it, you've seen it on occasion if you've been to either of those other LV locations.  Why return so often to this CF? Awesome food and service and rarely an unruly customer. We've visited for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner over the years and I think maybe twice there was a problem with the food, which was rectified quickly. We've been there as a party of two, with out of town friends, with a group, and each time have gone away happy.   So, consistency in quality (food and service) is one point in their favor. Another is the wide variety of menu items. Sure, there are several pages of variations on chicken, but there are also so many different meat preparations, salads, sandwiches, Asian offerings and tasty appetizers to fit the bill. A bread basket to start, and two pages of cheesecake variations to finish (key lime is #1!)...mmmm...  I am a coffee snob, not so much (though a little) a chain snob, but even this is hard to find fault with at CF. Yes, it's a chain, but there are unique menu items (see other reviews, which I agree with) that other places don't have and can't reproduce in such surroundings. All that makes it kind of \"unique\" among chains and I've squared the circle as best I can here.   The reason for four rather than five stars is my own little entitled whine...bring back the Turkey Reuben, I say! Every time I ordered it, the waiter/waitress said \"great choice,\" so why did it vanish from the menu in 2009?",

After that she disappeared. I made a weak joke to my husband; i said they probably had to go out and catch the salmon. He ordered the salmon and i had the wellness salad on the way. It took forever.  And no they weren't busy. And this food server still with the non welcoming attitude when she finally brought out the rest of it. Which reminds me, she didn't eve pour the Heineken into the glass. That's what customers are for I guess. She just plopped down the bottle of beer and the glass and left.  My husband agreed that the service was terrible but he left a 20% tip. I wouldn't have stiffed her but i wouldn't have left 20%.  I won't be back. There are other restaurants that employ people who act professionally and are glad for the business. Evidently Cheesecake Factory isn't bothered by things like that. If you want to know the server's name ask; i\"ll tell you.",

Lasting for only 2 hours and in the bar area only where you can sit at the bar, one of 5 or 6 high tops, one of 5 or 6 tables and even the patio.  All items are $6.50 and we are talking full size appetizers not small portion appetizers that many restaurants give you at a reduced priced and call it a happy hour. They offer 5 or 6 specialty cocktails and most beer and wine.  Also about 15 of their most popular appetizers again at $6.5 and full size regular menu portions.  You really can't go wrong. Also they start you out with some great fresh made bread and butter that never ends if you wish. Service for the most part it usually pretty good. We have probably been to this and the rampart location 30-40 times over the years only for happy hour and suggest showing up at 4pm for a table with usually no wait. The 3 Amigos",

My dinner last night, a Santa Fe Salad was wilted and unappetizing, entirely unpleasant, lacked the chicken element, the dressing they used was disgustingly sweet and rendered the entire meal virtually inedible. The bread and butter was good and our server was sweet, thoughtful and professional. With all the restaurants to patronize in Henderson, I wouldn't waste my time or another dime on this place. I think they are over-rated as it is and that includes their namesake product. I am aware this is not a fine dining restaurant and is really more of a TGIF or Applebee's type of low end establishment, but I have had meals at other CCF locations that were better than this by far.

However, what's unfortunate is when they're really busy, expect that your drinks will most likely arrive 15-20 minutes after you've been seated. Their service is usually good. We had the same server as we did last time. He was great. Everything just took forever that night. My one concern, and the reason why I'm writing this review, is in regards to their sanitation.  When we sat down, I realized they placed the utensils ON THE TABLE. Rather than on the napkins, they decide to place the utensils that you're supposed to use with your food, on the table after they've bussed it. I think that is truly unsanitary and just plain disgusting. Also, my knife had a fingerprint!! They should change how they set their tables and where they place the utensils.   This is unfortunate because I like cheesecake.",

The bread was so dry and stale it ruined the experience of my sandwich  My French fries were cold.  My moms meatloaf was warm so I know the fries had to be cold to start I'm so disappointed  I hate ordering takeout and getting home only to find that the restaurant gets away with a poor job And poor quality of food  Wasted money big time!",

This place is good for big group hang in out since they have big menu with different things. The drink menu & the dessert as cheese cake are most popular here. The food here are variety for different taste & different culture but everything is so so not for the best. I got my mushroom pasta which is too creamy for me. I didn't expect it in the best way right at beginning but our cheese cake are delicious.",

But we were seated at a booth and it was all good after that! Always love dining at Cheesecake Factory.",

I have ritualistically eaten the tiramisu cheesecake for years and never when I ate a slice, was there more whip cream on the plate than actual cheesecake. It is more than disappointing to order slices to go and get home and wonder what happened to the other half of my slice. If this is the future slice size, I will be ordering juniors to ship from NY. What a let down. The only reason I am giving the second star is because the flavor is always delicious and consistent but not worth the price when I open the box to this.",

I noticed it sitting all the way in the booth. However I am pregnant, so EVERYTHING is heightened.. not to make matters worse but 2 of the 3 of us were pregnant so I wasn't nuts the whole table made a comment and just breathed through our mouth when she came by.   We eventually said something in a lighter tone and she and played off the smell blaming this nice bald waiter but we knew it was her so it made it really unappetizing to eat our food.   I will day I had the spicy chicken tacos and they were adorable! The only suggestion I'd made it tone it down on the cilantro in the rice, but that's completely preference.   I'd definitely go back because the food it great and well I've never met a piece of cheesecake I didn't get along with.",

Also had to call it out to my server like, \"Is this right?\"  I get it that cinnamon does certain things with the body and taste buds but I would have much rather preferred a Sangria with Stevia or something so it didn't taste different than other drinks.  I'm not in love with cinnamon like that.  It is \"Skinny\" though because I only had one.    The wheat bread is always the same and I ate plenty of it.  I'll probably stick to Happy Hour and eat the beef and chicken sliders as I have been.  Stay away from the \"skinny\" stuff here.  Cheesecake is for the happy fattening food eaters.",

We have been going here since it has opened and in no way will we stop going and or want anyone reading this to be discouraged of going as well !!   Tonight we decided to go during HAPPY HOUR to have a couple drinks, dinner and spend some time together as a couple ! Our service was an issue from the start with a very slow start ! We ordered our drinks and something was floating in my wife's drink and we asked for another one ! We watched very closely to ensure that she received a fresh drink and this time the glass was dirty ! Third one was the charm although she really on drank one drink !! My beer on the other was tasty but and hour later finally received my second !   The waitress was nice and we did give her some feedback and I must say she had enough courage to tell her manager without us asking ! The first manager approached us and was full of excuses from the start blaming Happy Hour - For real , you have happy hour the same time everyday and a manager should never Make Excuses !! They had 2 bartenders three servers and a manager with less than 50 people to wait on ! Later on in the evening Dawn , another manager came to our table and took full responsibility and apologized 100% with no excuses giving us a 6.00 discount ! We were not looking for anything but I must say overall a disappointing experience this time around !!",

We usually go to Grand Lux Cafe at the Palazzo Hotel which is same owner, same menu.  As soon as we entered the waiting area, nobody greeted or approached us.  The little lady at the counter with a dark hair just look at us a few times but didn't ask or say anything to us.  We were alone, nobody else is waiting to be seated and been ignored for about 5-7 minutes.  We were about to leave but I decided to just ask the lady at the counter but then her phone rang and decided to answer the phone instead of talking to me.  A blonde lady passed by, so I just asked her what do we have to do to get seated other than waiting for a long time by the counter.  She said the lady on the phone should have helped us but she's just gonna seat us instead.  That left us bad impression and experience on our first visit.",

From the time we were brought to our table to the time we left, everything was a great experience!  Tiffany, our waitress deserves a special shout out for being so attentive to our group!  Every time I eat at a Cheesecake Factory, I typically order the same food dishes, starting off with the avocado egg rolls with the sweet cilantro dressing.  If you've never had these, definitely order them as a starter! Ah - Maze - Zing!  I'm also a burger lover and saw the Mac n cheese burger!? What?! My two favorites put into a burger!  Now, I'll be honest, it was delicious to have Lk that extra cheese, I wish the fried Mac n cheese had more of a crunch. I feel the cheese sauce doused that crunch one would want for texture contrast.  Minor detail, it was cheesy, beefy, and the sweet potato fries were delicious!  With the amazing portions that you are served, you have to remember to leave room for dessert!  To top off such an epic meal, a slice of salted caramel cheesecake is always a great closer!  If you're in Henderson and want something to relieve that \"hangry\" pain, come here and spend time with the fam bam or your crew!  They've got something for you!  :)",

Literally he walked up to our table says \"hoe does the food taste\" we reply good (because it did taste good, the appetizers we had gotten) then he walks away with not one other word. I will definitely be making an official complaint to their corporate. I can forgive the late food but for the manager to not even acknowledge the issues after the Waiter brought it to his attention he also did not even apologize for the issues.   HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!! The manager on April 22, 2017 evening shift needs to be trained in how to provide good customer service.",

    "text": "This factory was in full production mode when I came in on Monday afternoon.  I mean it was really hopping.  I came in at 2:00 PM thinking I would have missed the lunch rush and beat the dinner rush.  It did work out that way.  I had to wait 20 minutes for a table.  I guess that is what happend when they offer cheesecake slices for half price.  Thats what brought me in.  Oh, and the prospect of a good lunch.  I was seated after waiting a while which I didn't fully mind.  I would have been fine sitting at the bar if it got me seated sooner but I had a nice table to myself when I was seated.  My serve came over right away and brought my bread and water out pretty quickly.  For my lunch I ordered the lunch size pasta DiVinci.  Afterall, it has MUSHROOMS!  It also has grilled onions, chicken and sauce.  I asked for some fresh grated cheese to top it.  This was not a bad bowl of pasta but it could have been better.  The pasta to chicken ratio seemed off.  The mushrooms were good.  The onion tasted burnt.  And there seemed to be a taste of burnt oil too.  It wasn't terribly off putting but it was noticeable.  The dish has a lot of potential but I think the kitchen was bitten by the mass crowds and suffered for it.  Regardelss, I saved some for later and also asked to have my left over bread packaged to-go.  This was a late lunch/early dinner.  I knew I would be hungry again before bed time.  So asking for a doggie bag was my way of planning ahead.  I also wanted to save room for the cheesecake that brought me in in the first place.  For dessert, I ordered a slice of tiramisu cheesecake.  That combines two of my favorite desserts into one delectable sin on a plate.  Coffee soaked lady fingers for a crust, soft and fluffy cheesecake filling, a dusting of cocoa powder, and a dollup of chocolate whipped cream made this one delicious way to end my afternoon.  I'd order that in a heartbeat (possibly my last heartbeat at the rate I'm going with these dishes).  But there are so many other options to try.  This is the Cheesecake Factory, you know.  What kind of place would it be if it didn't have too many cheesecake options?  All the more reason to come back.",

However, I had an awful experience today that warrants a one star rating.   In honor of national cheesecake day, the Cheesecake Factory is offering half price cheesecake. What a deal! And it is. But who knew that you'd have to deal with snotty, rude and unprofessional employees in order to get your piece of the pie, or cheesecake, in this instance?   So I go in and it's busy. Like really, really busy. And of course it is! The best cheesecake on planet earth is half off! I go right to the counter line and after waiting for about 5 minutes (which was actually quicker than I thought it would be considering how busy they were) I got to the counter and get not so much as a hello, hi, what can I get for you? Nothing. Nada. Zilch. Just a girl staring at me waiting for me to place my order. Ok-they're busy and she's probably stressed. I get that. No biggie.   I requested 4 pieces of cheesecake - 2 Reece's, 1 snickers and 1 salted caramel. Alas, I was informed that it's only 1 piece half off per person. Since I'm there by myself, I'm basically only able to get 1 piece at the discount and the rest will be full price. No problem - it makes sense to put a cap on it so that people don't go crazy. I decide that I don't want to pay full price for 3 pieces and adjust my order to remove the salted caramel and just ordered 2 Reece's and 1 snickers.   I pay and even leave a small tip ($3) in the tip cup. I walk away from the counter and a couple minutes later she calls me back to get my cheesecake. I look in the bag and unfortunately there's 1 Reece's, 1 snickers and 1 salted caramel. NOT what I'd ordered, paid and even TIPPED for! This, my cheesecake loving friends, is how the rest of my visit went - verbatim:  Me: Oh shoot, I didn't want the salted caramel. That was the one I cancelled.  Her: So what do you want then? Me: 2 Reece's and 1 snickers. I'm sorry.   * At this point she ROLLS HER EYES and SHAKES HER HEAD, takes out the salted caramel and walks away. I am so disappointed and feel like I'm putting her out when in all actuality, it was HER that made the mistake and ME that was being apologetic about it. Huh? *  Me: (out loud and to no one in particular) Not sure what that attitude is all about.   The manager is standing there and overheard my comment and this is how the remainder of my visit went, again verbatim:  Manager: Well you know what it is, ma'am? We're not even supposed to be doing this.  Me: You're not supposed to be doing what? Manager: Giving half price for take out orders. We're actually only supposed to be honoring it for dine in customers.  Me: Well I certainly appreciate that you're honoring it but I don't think the attitude that comes along with it is necessary.   And at that point I got my CORRECT cheesecake and walked out.   It's unfortunate that the manager chose to defend his employee ROLLING HER EYES and SHAKING HER HEAD at me rather than apologize for her completely unprofessional and unjustified behavior. Like I said, I get that they're busy. I understand that it's a stressful job. And I definitely appreciate that they honored the discounted price when, apparently, they didn't have to. But as a customer, I should not be treated that way, especially when the mistake wasn't mine and I was kind and gracious even when she made the mistake.   Shame on this employee and shame on this manager (both whose names I didn't get, dang it). Hopefully their attitudes improve-for the sake of other customers who don't deserve to be treated so poorly.",

Last night after waiting just about twice that amount of time, we still had not been served. And during that entire time not once did we see our server to ask her what- the-f  was going on. After watching the next table get their food delivered.. (they had ordered AFTER us).. it was just TOO much. We asked to speak with the manager, told her our gripe.. and got up and walked out (went across the street and got a pizza in 10 minutes).  Our mistake was not sitting at the bar in the first place as we usually do.. servers there are captive in a smaller space, and glaring glances are not easily evaded.",

Clouds were coming and going so a nice little warmth of sun here and there. Then a party of 3 adults and 2 kids come outside and instantly complains about the sun..so down the blinds go. Ugh really! Don't sit outside then. It was beautiful outside and not hot at all! Mind you we spent $125 plus tip for 2 people and we don't get a say in the blinds. Ridiculous! Put a damper on the day for sure.  Second week in a row we were there thought we had found our Monday date day spot for sure but now I could care less about going back. Whatever",

My friendly waitress greeted me asap and gave me a menu with the large variety of choices to choose from. I ended up going with the Salmon Miso which was topped on steamed rice and served with pea pods. The fish was fresh & moist and the miso sauce went good when combined with the rice and pods. Instead of going with a fancy cheesecake I chose the original which was served with whipped cream. The cheesecake was silky smooth and creamy and not overly rich but filling.  Overall for me - the large variety of choices, good quality in a pleasant atmosphere make Cheescake Factory a solid choice to dine.",

When coming on the weekends though, make sure to come 30 minutes-1 hour earlier than when you normally eat because this place is hopping with people and the wait can be taxing to those who are impatient.

When you come here the only thing that may bug me is their service.It's like one day I'll eat here and the server is awesome and the next time it's the total opposite.But I will gladly take it for the food is key. I normally stick to a couple things here but I've tried alot of things that are amazing.  My faves are Ahi tempura roll Shrimp and bacon club Rib eye steak with garlic mashed potatoes that comes with one delicious onion ring( I wish they came with 5 of them..lol) Miso salmon (sometimes the rice is too hard and uncooked) Cabonara  Of course the red velvet cheesecake is the best (Ive tried alot of other dishes here like breakfast stuff like the chicken hash and the Monte cristo sandwich but they weren't really memorable)  Oooh and don't forget about that bread! Yummy! I will always have cheescake factory as an option for a meal any day of the week",

    "text": "In all our years, neither my husband nor myself have ever eaten at a Cheesecake Factory. So when my coworker gave me a giftcard, we decided to treat ourselves.  Upon entering the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice how busy it was. We had to yell just to hear each other. This was on a Thursday around 6:30 pm. I would hate to see how packed it gets on a Saturday.  We were seated after a short wait at a part booth/ part table. My husband took the booth side, and I sat in the uncomfortable and not-so-fat-friendly chair across from him. Halfway through the dinner service I moved to the booth with my husband because my butt was going numb. It's hilarious to me to think that a restaurant that serves food like a macaroni and cheese hamburger would use chairs that only a child or Victoria Beckham could fit into.  My husband ordered a burger and I ordered the chicken penne. We were surprised how huge the servings were, and ended up taking half our food home with us. Next time we will probably just share an entree. Overall, the food was really delicious, which says a lot considering I'm generally a pretty picky eater. We ordered three cheesecake slices to go because we couldn't decide on which one we wanted to try the most. We ordered the red velvet, white chocolate raspberry, and the Reeses peanut butter cup. The Reeses we didn't care for. The red velvet was just okay. But the white chocolate raspberry was AH-MAZING.  We didn't care much for our waiter. He hardly spoke to us the entire time we were there. I believe the only time he spoke was when we were ordering, which was minimal. The rest of the time he kind of just ignored us and the rest of his tables, and stood there looking at himself in a mirror or talking to the other waiters.  Overall, we will still go back, not because of the service, but because of the food.",

I was taken out to dinner here to enjoy my first \"real\" meal after being on a very strict protein-and-pretty-much-nothing-else diet for the past two months.  I didn't know what to order and ended up getting spaghetti and meat sauce. I wasn't really a fan. It was too sour and there wasn't any \"oomph\" with the flavor in the sauce or meat.  As for my date's dish, he got grilled salmon with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Definitely looked a lot more appetizing than my spaghetti. He let me try some of the salmon and mashed potatoes. Salmon was okay. Those mashed potatoes though. Oh My God. I died. My taste buds were in heaven. The butter and the texture. The underlying kick of horseradish. I could have just eaten the mashed potatoes as my dinner. He even asked if I wanted a side of mashed potatoes to go since I was so clearly enjoying myself. I should have said yes.... hah!  As for dessert, I thought about getting cheesecake, but I really wanted ice cream. I hear my date say  \"oh my god\" right before I'm greeted by a freaking goblet of chocolate ice cream with whipped cream and almonds and hot fudge. I did my happy dance while enjoying that.  I do wonder if those mashed potatoes would taste different if I wasn't just coming off of a really restricted diet though. But it doesn't matter - that was a dinner date I probably won't ever forget. Haha!",

Then there are those time where neither can make up for the other.  In the last two times I went here I ordered the Diane steak and most recently the Margarita pizza (spelling).  The Diane steak was super salty that I barely nibbled it. It also took about 1 hour for our food to get to our table, but the server and the manager was very apologetic. The latest time I was here was for my best friend's birthday. The pizza was okay. It was a little drier than I'm used to, but it was fresh. The wait to from order was quick, bit the server was not up to par. We also had mentioned at several occasions that it was her birthday and the server also checked for her ID when she ordered her drink. In all honesty, it was the main reason we came here so we, plus the servers, could make her feel special on her birthday by singing her happy birthday -- but alas, our server did not do it and we left very unhappy. We even left a note saying the same thing to the server on the back of the receipt.  Hopefully next time it will be a better experience.",

They also have a to-go station where you can also order cheesecake by the slices or by whole! The server (I can't remember his name sadly) was really amazing! He made sure that my birthday was special. I got the shrimp summer rolls to start off. Sooo delicious. The sauce was amazing! Even the plating was beautiful! For the main plate I got the Chicken Madeira. I now know why it's the most popular plate. It's so big and just amazing. So many flavors. I could not find one bad thing about it. I also got a tall blue moon. That was a little weird because it didn't have any foam which means it was sitting out for a while. I was way too full to even get cheesecake but the food was definitely worth it. All in all, amazing! I love the food, layout, and service here!",

Quite fitting here.  The service is the same at almost all locations - pretty good. I'm not a big fan of the huge menu. I know TCF is a successful restaurant chain and the big menu is part of their schtick but sometimes you just need a restaurant to be great at a few things rather than just okay on a long list of things. Plus, the endless variety of items, makes it impossible for me to narrow things down when I have no idea what I want in the first place ----but that's probably just me.  I have enjoyed their Chicken Picatta almost every visit - it's my favorite thing on the menu and it has a lunch sized-portion as well.  Their cocktail menu has many great items on it as well. Not a big fan of their standard margaritas though....  All in all, if you've been to cheesecake factory before and loved it, this location is very much on par with the rest of them. But if you have an option and it's a special occasion, I really hope that with all Las Vegas has to offer dining-wise, I hope you do your due diligence and branch out.  But hey, Cheescake Factory is A-Ok to me.",

The only reason they get 2 stars instead of one is because there wasn't a wait,  the server was nice and the cheesecake was good.

I got the bleu cheese burger WITHOUT bleu cheese...of course it was like an hour later they finally bring us our dishes and it had the bleu cheese. I was really disappointed because the waiter was kind of mean. He tells me ITS NOT and totally insisted i try it. If I don't like it, why would I eat it?! My husband tasted it and said of course it's bleu cheese. If it wasn't then there wouldn't be any cheese on the burger at all :( They sent it back and I had to wait another 10-15 minutes for them to make a new one...Considering our tab was over $280, I wouldn't go back there for the bad service I received and my burger wasn't even good to say the least...",

Tonight I ordered the fried cheese starter platter, soup du jour (tortilla), and the Chicken and Biscuit entree. Let me start off but saying the fried cheese was excellent, about 8 little triangles perfectly breaded and crisped with Gouda and Mozzarella cheeses and melted to perfection. They were the perfect temperature. The soup was so-so, a basic bisque like consistency with corn and some other veggies. It had a nice spicy finish but at first bite the saltiness is a little  overwhelming. The entree is one of my favorite a good solid buttermilk biscuit, very flaky and buttery, with a vegetable melange (carrots were slightly undercooked) , mushrooms, and peas. The chicken however was moist and juicy, pan seared to perfection. It also had just the right amount of rosemary crust. And the gravy that they use is fantastic, not to rich or thick, and not overly seasoned. That's what I like about this entree it's not overly done so you can really enjoy each component. And our server, Nick, totally professional and nice and a real babe. Over all a great experience and will definitely be back!",

We started with Calamari which was very good, the calamari was NOT rubbery , it was easy to chew , and was perfectly breaded. Completely delicious.  She ordered the Thai pasta ... and I ordered the Chicken Romano  Both were delicious. I loved the Chicken romano, the chicken was crispy and the pasta was delicious. There was so much that I could only eat half my dinner.  The Thai pasta.. I have to confess I kept stealing bites of my roommates dinner. The texture was good, the mix of flavors was just amazing ... I think I found a new favorite dish. I think my roommate was wishing she had ordered something else after I kept trying to distract her so I could steal bites.  We drank the Passion Iced Tea. It was really complimentary to the meal.   Our server kept the glasses filled and even brought a huge glass of ice when ours melted too fast.   Then we ordered CHEESECAKE... She ordered the Tuxedo cheesecake . I tried a bite and the rich chocolate is definitely going to fit on my schedule from now on. It is perfectly chocolatey.    I ordered The Caramel cheesecake I can't remember what the fancy schmancey name is .. but it was yummy in my tummy.   They even sang happy birthday to me .. how rockin is that??",

    "text": "Great restaurant. Service is generally pretty good, but not always. Best service is at the bar. Yes you can eat at the bar. We have been here over a dozen times, and are very critical of restaurants. The Variety of food here is excellent and everything is very well prepared. I would recommend all of the cheese cake factories we have eaten at. The food is consistently excellent. Very popular restaurant and you may have to wait to be seated, which is why the bar is a good choice since you can often get immediate service without waiting.",

When family or friends come to town and are not sure what they are in the mood for i bring them here. They have such a diverse menu and there is always something from everone. here are a few of my favorites. -Grilled Mahi taco which i order %95 of the time -Calamari as an App. always good and love the dipping sauce -Chicken Costeletta- lighly breaded served with mash potatos and asparagus -I have tried or sampled most of the pasta dishes my wife has ordered and haven't had a complaint about one yet. -Corn fritters are delicious -Cheese cake of coarse. I like most that i have tried but didn't like the red velvet one. too much icing overwhelmed what little cake was there, just not a good balance - I always have a mojito or two or three... Can't wait to go back, this location is always busy so plan for that in advance",

We had the avocado rolls, it comes with a sweet and sour kind of sauce, was really good. Also the Shepard's pie ( to die for, srsly), and the fettuccine Alfredo.

I can make a meal out of that bread and butter any day of the week. And the cheesecake. How can you deny a slice of heaven? My latest fave is the red velvet cheesecake. I'm not a huge red velvet fan, but when you layer it with cheesecake and top it with cream cheese icing? Aweeesumm.  Other notable menu items: deep fried macaroni and cheese and the Chicken Madeira.",

Our last experience here was a not so great one.The food was really greasy for some reason and I had an upset stomach for the rest of the night.  The waitress was pretty rude, when she decided to show up to the table, until the check showed then all of the sudden she was really nice and upbeat. We assumed she did that for a tip because she did it right in the middle of us signing the check. Ugh that really bothers me.  We are always nice to our servers and we are not hard to please. I wish I could say that maybe she just had a long day but she told us that she just got there and she was taking over our table from the other waitress who's shift was ending and I have to say she was so much nicer at the end of a shift than our new waitress at the beginning of her shift. Like I said at the start of this review, we like cheesecake factory but will probably not be returning to this location.",

I'm totally not a hater (okay... well, in this case, maybe I am a little bit)... but when you live in a foodies paradise, is that the best you can do? Anyhoo... I pull into the parking lot and there's a Semi Limo (as in, truck in the front, limo in the back) in the parking lot. Immediate thought: only in Vegas.... maybe I will be surprised. And, surprised I was. I went for the Spicy Chicken Salad (sub-ing the bird for the shrimp) and was surprised at the freshness of the mixed greens, the bite in the peppers and the distinctiveness of the cilantro. The spicy vinaigrette was also a nice touch. This salad was not the type that would have been made in the Cheesecake Factory I remembered.   Can I give CF higher than 3 stars? No, not when there are so many other fabulous restos in this city. But, for a good go-to place with lots of options and decent service, you can't go wrong with this place.",

    "text": "July 30th is National Cheesecake Day. What better way to celebrate this surely made-up holiday then by meeting some friends at The Cheesecake Factory? That is exactly what I did this past Friday.  My group was made up of a coworker, his wife, their 2 year old son, and another coworker. Two of us arrived first, we decided to start out in the bar area because it was happy hour. $5 drinks!   Despite the crowd, we were seated within about 10 minutes from arrival. Our server, Paul, greeted us with an \"Aloha!\" and brought out waters and some bread for us to munch on while we waited for the rest of our group.   Once the rest of our group arrived, Paul came back over to see if we had any questions. A member of our group asked him for his personal suggestions and he rattled off his favorites for all parts of the menu, from salads to pasta to fish dishes.  Anyone that has been to The Cheesecake Factory knows that the menu is like a short novel, I was impressed with how knowledgeable Paul was about everything on the menu.   Since some of us were hungry and others were more interested in drinks and desert (namely, me!), we ended up splitting a few appetizers between the group, and then two people ordered entrees as well. First appetizer choice was avocado egg rolls. This is my must-order item at Cheesecake Factory, nothing compares to their avocado egg rolls. We also had the crab cakes and the sweet corn tamale cakes. They were all excellent.   Finally it was desert time. Since it was National Cheesecake Day, all slices were half price. Bonus! I ordered my usual, a slice of the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake. It is unbelievable, the tartness of the lemon and raspberry are the perfect compliment to the sweet creaminess of the cheesecake.  Paul ended up being the icing on the cake, the reason a 4 star review became a 5 star one. He was an exceptional server, he always seemed to know when to come check on us, and when to leave us alone. A member of our group was so pleased with the service he waited after paying the bill to speak to the manager and let him know just how happy he was to have had Paul serve us.   Will I be back? Yes, and I won't be waiting til National Cheesecake Day to go!",

From the beginning he was excellent with giving my daughter paper to go with crayons I brought (they don't give kids any), to giving advice on what to order based on the selections I was choosing between. He was quite attentive keeping our cups full and asking if we needed anything. He even brought the cheesecake in to go boxes as we weren't eating more than a few bites!  Then the food was better than usual, not sure if choices or chef of the day but food was good. I had BBQ chicken salad which is my fave at a competing restaurant, I liked it better here! He had some kind of chicken and shrimp in a warm PB sauce (I can't remember name) and he loved it. Then I don't like cheesecake but I eat the Adams peanut butter usually, Joe reccommended the Reese's peanut butter cheesecake and it was decadent! He had red velvet as his fave!  The best part was the managers or owners or something were meeting with the chefs across from us and they kept saying how cute and wonderful my daughter is. That is the truth! Lol!",

I could eat most any of the appetizers (except the fried macaroni -- too weird), but love the corn cakes.  I'm a Chicken Romano kind of girl and my husband varies from the Steak Diane to the Shepard's Pie to lots of other things.  I am so glad that they now have \"lunch\" portions.  They are still too big for me to finish, but at least I'm not leaving an entire cow on my plate.    We always wonder why they can have such a huge menu and still make most dishes taste terrific when other restaurants can barely make one thing well.  The only thing we avoid is the cheesecake.  I've never liked cheesecake and my husband can take it or leave it.  And after their huge portions, he generally leaves it.  Oh, and did I mention the bar?  Great drinks.  I LOVE the smoothies.

Yes, they were over $25 a rack, but they were the best damn beef ribs I've EVER had, period.  So how could they get rid of it?  I don't understand it.  When I inquired about it, they said that they change their menus all the time.  It may be back.  They also mentioned that it was their most requested item off the old menu, which doesn't make any sense.  This four-star review reflects their current menu options...if they ever decide to bring them back, the beef ribs make it an easy 5 stars.  Also, be sure to check out their strawberry lemonade...it's served with sugar around the rim, and it's deliciously sweet and refreshing.  Seriously the best strawberry lemonade I've tasted (comparable to Lucille's Smokehouse, which is also pretty damn good).",

Also, I nearly left before deciding to check to ensure the cheesecake was in the bag, and I saw they'd forgotten that, too!  I wish I'd have checked for the sausage...    Can't make the trip back - no time today.  For the $ I dropped there, I should at least get what I ordered!   Called back and was put on hold.  Waited so long that I could have driven back myself to pick it up!   I come here so rarely, and when I do, I'm looking for some quality for the higher price.  Super disappointed.  *Update:  I actually ate the dish and decided to add a star because it was pretty tasty.   ...just not what I'd ordered...",

If you can't find something you're in the mood for, it must not exist. My wife jokingly refers to the menu as the bible; She'll say, \"turn to the book of desserts\". It may be a joke, but it's not far off from the truth. The menu has everything from pizza and pastas, burgers and sandwiches, steak and chicken, breakfasts, brunches, even a section called \"power foods\" with things like kale and quinoa salads. Even the dessert menu takes up 2 or 3 pages. Suffice it to say, if you've got a group with diverse tastes, The Cheesecake Factory is a safe bet to please everyone.",

Preferable when seated or shortly afterwards, the norm in most restaurants.   Previous experience; -foreign inedible non food items should not end up disguised in the meal ( spit out 5-6 dime sized pieces of cardboard from a Hibachi Steak dinner from a previous visit)  Most of my experience with this location have been great.

    "text": "MEH. Exactly how I still feel about it.  My mother and I were trying to think about a place to go and have lunch. She lives in the Anthem area, and we were trying to stay close by. She brought up the Cheesecake Factory. I was neither excited, or sad. Good opportunity, right?  This place was busy, but it wasn't full to the brim. We didn't have to wait long for a table... maybe three minutes. I told the hostess that there were 2 (meaning two adults,) and one highchair.  Some how, this converted to three adult menus, and no high chair. Two different ladies told me that they would bring me a high chair, before a third one brought me one.....after she finished her conversation, of course.  Our waitress comes by and asks us for our drink order (2 waters with lemon.) No straws. We ask for straws while we continue to look at the HUGE menu.   Now, I don't know how Cheesecake Factory's black straws come, but ours came UNwrapped, and the waitress felt the desire to put them in our drinks for us. I hope she washed her hands.  She leaves us, and we decide on what we want. Menus closed, she passes us.  Passes us, again. aannnndd again.  My mom finally flags her down. The waitress said that she wasn't \"aware\" of our readiness.  *sigh* whatever.  My mom has appetizers, the tuna tar tar, and the white bean hummus.  I ask for the Spicy crispy chicken sandwich. I ask what type of cheese is put on the sandwich.  \"Jack\".  Do you have Provolone?  We have cheddar, blah blah blah blah. We can do a shredded mozzarella on it for you.   OKAY, so is that a NO, that you don't have provolone? Gotcha.   We wait a decent amount of time for our food. Thank goodness for their bread and butter, which you now have to ASK for.  My mom's tar tar was small. Personal appetizer small. In my opinion, not enough to share.  Her hummus was just thrown in the bowl, with a piece of the flatbread already in there, getting soggy, most likely.  My sandwich was nothing special. Honestly, I've had a better one, out of a box, frozen. and it cost me $1 from my grocery store.  It comes out, on a \"toasted\" brioche bun. With a rather large piece of fried chicken, that looks like it is missing from a red and white striped bucket.  Why this is called \"spicy\", I will never know. Even with the entire side of chipotle mayo that  came with it, it was pretty bland.  Blah Meh food, and meeeeeeeeehhhh service? Not so much.",

Instead of using a boring conference room, why not hold it at a restaurant.  Can we say expense it! LOL.  For my meal, I got the regular size Miso Salmon plate for $19.95.  Start off with big serving of grilled salmon on a plateau of brown rice (or white if you prefer), surrounded by a butter sauce with pockets of sweet Miso sauce and garnished with Chinese peas.  I LOVED the Salmon.  The fish was perfectly grilled and had a wonderful light char on the skin.  The flesh was juicy and flavorful.  Great accompaniment with the Miso sauce.  I personally found that the butter sauce was waaay too rich and appreciated having the Chinese peas around to break up the monotony of  the rich butter sauce.  Other than that, the dish is on point.    The ambiance was great.  Always a vibrant atmosphere with dramatic lighting and decor.  I feel like I'm in the middle of Europe, yet not.  LOL.

    "text": "It's a chain. I tend to avoid restaurant chains as much as I can. But there is a special little spot of love in my heart for the CF. And it has everything to do with the Buffalo Blasts, variety of cheesecakes, and Lemon Drop martinis.  What, you don't know about the Buffalo Blasts?! They are perhaps one of the greatest appetizers ever devised. No, seriously. It's like a chicken wing chopped up, tossed with hot sauce and cheese, then stuffed into this crispy, fried triangle thingy. And then served with sides of an awesome hot sauce and an amazing blue cheese sauce. Tip: Order extra sides of the sauces right from the start. If you are a dipper, you're going to need extra. The Buffalo Blasts are basically some of the most awesome hot wings you will ever have.  Everyone knows about the cheesecakes. So many by the slice that choosing even just two or three becomes a challenge. I have been known to take home six different slices with me. My go-to fav, though, is the White Chocolate Raspberry. And, call it sad or not, but it is some of my favorite cheesecake of anywhere ever.  And I don't know what it is that they do to their Lemon Drop martinis, but I love them. I love them more than any other Lemon Drops from anywhere else. Maybe it's their lemonade. Maybe it's their sugar. I don't really care. I just know they are strong and delicious, and I need a friend to supervise me so I don't down like five of them.  This location can get busy, so be prepared for a wait. The bar area is on the small side. Overall, nothing particularly noteworthy or different - it's the same as the rest of the CF locations. Service is always good.",

That means, Vegas is one place where I can eat at the Cheesecake Factory with a clear conscience.   Plus they have a pretty decent happy hour that happened to be going on right when I got into town. There are a bunch of appetizers and cocktails for $5 and beers for $4. The fried mac & cheese balls are great and you can never go wrong with calamari. I was also impressed with the made to order guacamole which was a huge portion! We ended up buying more chips at Whole Foods to eat the leftovers back in our hotel room. There are also quite a few options on the small bites menu including some healthier (ahem, not fried) items like kale salad and ahi tuna.   Yeah it's a chain and you can get Cheesecake Factory just about anywhere, but trust me their food is that much better when you don't know how many calories are in it.",

To start our server Clayton was Fantastic! A seasoned waiter who knew exactly when to stop in when we needed something, Great demeanor and Very friendly (sadly a quality missing among some wait staff in many establishments today).        The drinks were great! If you are a Bourbon fan make sure you try their Bourbon & Honey cocktail along with their Sausage and Ricotta flatbread (two of our favorites after many visits to the Cheesecake).       Most menu items are a generous portion, always food leftover to take home or share. Enjoyable atmosphere and beautiful designs inside restaurant itself, good place for a night out or casual date night! Cheesecake Factory is definitely a higher end casual establishment in which you will not regret paying a visit!",

The service here is pretty consistent but there can be very long waits when it's busy.   Some of my favorites are the factory chopped salad, fish tacos, chicken and garlic pasta and the avocado eggrolls which I've never seen anywhere else. The food is always good and usually comes out quickly, even when they are busy.  Of course I can't come here without getting a piece of cheesecake. The red velvet is delicious, loaded with cream cheese. I also like the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake. It's one of my new favorites. For being a chain restaurant the Cheesecake Factory delivers a great experience with good service and a wonderful selection of food.",

    "text": "We usually make it here at least a couple of times a year. This time, we were influenced by $50 in gift cards to dine on a Wednesday night around 7:30. Our party of seven waited about 15 minutes outside before we were greeted by our server who was kind enough to come outside and lead us inside to our table. The menu can be overwelming with endless choices. But that is good for our group which has a pretty wide spectrum of preferences. There hasn't been too many changes to the menu over the years with the small plates and Skinnylicious options being the most recent to me. For the rookies, don't go hog wild on the bread, because you won't be able to finish your three-serving portion entree.  Our order was pretty varied which included two entree salads, three sandwiches, a pasta dish, and the filet medallion off the Skinnylicious menu for me. There was plenty of \"filler\" vegetables and not a lot of beef for my entree as expected, but the vegetables were cooked and seasoned well. The pasta dishes have never really impressed me, but the salads are surprisingly good. If I don't get a steak dish, I'll usually get the tuna tataki salad which is a very flavorful salad. Everyone was happy with their meals with over half us needing take out boxes. We finished with two pieces of cheesecake. Over time, I've found that I prefer cheesecakes without any cake mixed in like the fresh strawberry, banana cream, and salted caramel.  I do have to comment on our server who left a good first impression by greeting us outside, but everything else really wasn't up to par. To add to the rehearsed, corny jokes where the response was crickets chirping after each one, he had no organization of our orders. Stating that I was seat 1 when taking drink orders and my daughter was seat 7 sitting across from me at the end of the table, he had no clue who drank what when he brought the drinks out, auctioning each one and running back and forth across the table. He forgot my mother and wife's glasses of wine, didn't notice they were without beverage after three return trips to the table, and he had to be reminded by me to grab them at the bar after 15 minutes. Then he did the always annoying checking every three minutes if I had signed the receipt after he ran my credit card. Which meant he was cut and wanting to bolt, but you don't want to perturb the person that is signing off on your tip.  Before gift cards were discounted, our check was a reasonable $163. What you'll get with Cheesecake Factory, as you will with other successful chains, is consistency. They need that consistency to handle the amount of volume that comes through the doors. The food and atmosphere in this location are also consistent with every other restaurant. The changing variable is the service, which is usually a hit. It comes down to whether you think that consistency is good, and I would tend to agree with most Yelpers that it is A-OK.",

Our friend Polly wanted to try it and it was her choice via The dice  :D  We each ordered an appetizer, I got the sweet corn tamale cakes and they were AMAZING!   SO YUMMY!  Dinner for me was the cajun chicken/shrimp and sausage with brown rice, it was not listed on the menu so I am thinking they removed it but they made it for me, the first time around though they did not include the sausage so I had to have them make a bit for me and the waitress said no problem at all and within 5 mins I had my sausage  :)  Dessert was amazing, I got the tiramasu cheesecake, my friend got the oreo cookie cheesecake and I liked his a lot better though, mine was just like the tiramasu, didnt really seem like 2 things to me, a cheesecake and a cake but thats ok it was still good.      Cant wait to go back and try more of the menu!",

The Chicken Piccata was a very good portion for lunch. It was okay but not something I would order again for takeout because the sauce lost its consistency and flavor by the time I got it home. Some foods are just not good for takeout and I've had this many times in the restaurant and its delicious. I was not a fan of the side salad. All it was was a bunch of weeds (no lettuce or romaine) 2 small tomato wedges and 2 cucumber slices. Slice of chocolate cake ($8.50!!!!) was just okay.

After giving them another shot, I was pleasantly surprised of the vast improvement of service and food.    Service here has been very attentive and friendly.  Drinks are refilled and food is served promptly.  Even the girls at the hostess station are more welcoming.    The food dishes such as the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp is becoming my favorite dish served here.  There are plenty of chicken and shrimp surrounding the rice.  The spicy Thai sauce is filled with flavors of curry, peanut, chile and coconut.  Every bite is delicious.    Of course it's hard to leave here without ordering cheesecake.  It is an extensive variety to choose from.  I have yet to try one I didn't like.  Plus the slices are so huge and easily split with someone.    I'm happy to say I'll be back soon for more.",

Food Fart-my term for when you are hungry, but you can't decide even with the HUNDREDS of dining options and cuisines in the 702 AND the Yelp App where you want to grab a bite to eat???? Anyone else run into this problem?   Anywho, we were on this side of town and we didn't care for anywhere on the strip(don't think anyone who works on the Strip cares either)and we were Chinatown'd out (also a famous area for Dirty Dining lately...looking at you, Joyful House!) Prices are very reasonable here and the portions are HUMANGOUS which is why I like to order off their Small Plates Menu and I always get the Pear, Bleu Cheese,  and Pecan Flatbread which has always been consistently good. I also got the Veggie Fries Combo which came with Portabellos, Zucchini, and Avocados. The avocados were my least favorite because they have no business being in the fryer IMO. These are one of those things that are great as-is.  Totally stuffed from dinner, we had no room for dessert, but we were pleased with our meal.  This is the first time though that our server kinda sucked. She just looked like she didn't want to be there...lucky we didn't let her ruin our visit. Next time you find yourself having a food fart, Cheesecake Factory may just be a good option!   ALOHA!!!!

I had to tell the cashier they have t o make me a new salad.  I dunno \"bout everyone but i don't like my leafy green warm. I like 'em crisp!  Crunch crunch chomp chomp!

Loved the fact that they allow service dogs, cuz our pups enjoyed dinner on the outdoor patio too!   Sooooooo it's Cheesecake Factory! Who doesn't LOVE The Cheesecake Factory?! If you love delicious dishes?! Cuz that's what you'll find here at Cheesecake. The menu is huuuuuuuge, be prepared it will take you a hot minute to find what you want to eat. My favorite dish is Chicken Piccata.  This dish has a bed of angel hair pasta with a creeeeaaammmmy white sauce with juicy chicken, capers and mushrooms. I love this dish!   You can't go wrong with the many options at The Cheesecake Factory. Seriously! For dessert, we opted for the red velvet cheesecake! Order this if you want some good good in your belly.   Note: if it's not too hot out, and if they have the misters going- sit in the outdoor patio, you'll catch a beautiful sunset. Soooo romantic!",

    "text": "Guilty pleasures come in all forms here in Las Vegas, whether it be the gambling, the alcohol or the strip clubs -- however, for me personally? It would have to be a restaurant. And a chain one, at that -- my personal guilty pleasure is the Cheesecake Factory, which is infamous for being one of the most ridiculously unhealthy restaurants in the States ( with many of its foods clocking in at over 2000 calories by themselves, and that's not including the cheesecakes they're famous for! ). While it's not exactly the healthiest or the \"best\" place for food by far, I still enjoy it enough that if I feel like indulging in cheesecake, this is where I go!  Following the 4th of July celebration at Green Valley Ranch, I was looking for somewhere to eat -- and as I was off from work at the time and housesitting by myself, I was really looking for a place where I could just eat what I wanted since I didn't have to worry about being anywhere the next day. Since Cheesecake Factory was open after the event, that made my decision easy for me -- I ordered the chicken samosas, the steak Diane, and a slice of the cherry chocolate cheesecake.  Of course, the Cheesecake Factory provides complementary bread for one to munch on while waiting for the food, and it is quite tasty, though I admit I didn't eat too much of the bread as I intended to save room for my order. The chicken samosas were surprisingly light, flaky and flavorful, though I didn't care too much for the cilantro cream that they were served with ( and is the only reason why I'm docking a point on this otherwise great outing ). The steak Diane was the better of the two dishes; medium rare steak with mushrooms, onions and a rich sauce -- all of these combined made for a savory dish that I consider one of the Factory's better options, as some of the NUMEROUS menu items tend to vary in quality.  The real star of the night was the cheesecake, however; True to its name, the Factory has numerous types of cheesecakes for all tastes, though for this meal I settled on the cherry chocolate cheesecake since I wanted something that wasn't too overly sweet ( LOL ). In that respect, the cheesecake was perfect: rich, decadent, creamy and studded with plenty of cherries and chocolate. Normally you're not supposed to finish the entire slice, but with how good it was I couldn't help but inhale it! ( THIS IS WHY YOU SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT HERE. )  The Cheesecake Factory is popular enough here in Vegas that it has multiple outposts in the City, including one on the Strip and another downtown by Symphony Park. However, of these, the one here in the District really does have the best service and the most relaxed feel of them all. This is definitely NOT the place for you to go to if you're keeping tabs on your waistline ( there's another place nearby for that, to be covered in maybe a future review ), but if you're looking for a good place for a solid cheat meal and good cheesecake, you can't go wrong by coming to the Factory.",

    "text": "I hate to give them 2 stars but after ordering take out from them twice, I've gotten food poisoning twice...it's not fun.  Cheesecake Factory was a place where it was once in awhile cause if I wanted to splurge, this place would be on top of my list. Which now I hate to say I don't think I'm going to come back.   It was a good place to meet up with people, a good place for date night and a good place to just over indulge and not feel guilty. But lately, their food is sub par, and it's sad. I ordered the chicken and shrimp gumbo, the first time I had it, I couldn't stop eating it. The last time I had it the shrimp wasn't cooked all the way, and this time I ordered it the grease was so thick it just tasted like oil. My girlfriend ordered the corn cakes and they weren't even cooked all the way, it was doughy inside ...not edible. And our tiramisu was just thrown in the container, looked like half of it didn't even make it.   The service at the bakery area wasn't that great. Literally had to wait 10 mins to be acknowledged, then just to get attitude from the girl. Not even a smile or nothing. I waited for another 15 mins for my food which should've been ready for pick up, but it wasn't. The girl was talking to another girl across the counter disregarding a couple people behind her. It's kind of sad to see a good food industry just not have the enthusiasm as before. It's hard for places to stay up and running when other places are coming in and taking over. I would hate to see this place go down in the dumps. Maybe when they get better reviews and more stars I will rethink my visit...but until then I'm sorry, I won't be back.",

Everytime I try to give this location a chance, the servers prove to me that they have no care for the service they give & they just care towards the end to give the bill. Oh! And may I add, the server checked on everyone else around us and us only towards the end. Totally not worth it to come here for the sh*t service. As we were leaving, server never said \"bye\" or \"thank you\"  Our server Jessica & apparently some of the other staff needs to get retrained on what customer service means. I'm no expert, but I know I should have been treated way better than that. I might as well have gotten to-go and served myself drinks at home since our cups were empty the whole meal. Server only checked on us when giving the check, not a descent thank you. Wanted to order more, but Yakno.. why stay in a place where we're getting treated like dirt!",

We paid with different colored cards and on the check I wrote next to each item red or blue for our debit card colors.   We got charged backwards. No big deal, waitress took the bill and brought it back ten minutes later.   The same thing again-charges were backwards. So we explained that the charges were backwards a second time. She said she would get a manager to fix this and when he came over and took the bills and brought them back they were finally correct.   My debit card was charged three times for something simple to figure out.  The one star is literally from the last 30 minutes we were stuck here waiting for our bill to be correct. I've waited tables for years so I know I'm not being a bad person when I say this could have all been avoided with one simple sentence; together or separate checks?   Kind of a bummer evening for my roommates bday dinner and the poor waitress that was almost in tears over something so easy. It was literally written on the check whose card to charge.

    "text": "When we arrived, I requested a table for 3, and specifically asked for a table, not a booth. My dad is in a wheelchair and needed to stay in it and just move a chair. We were told there would be about a 20 minute wait. So about that time passes and our pager buzzes, so no problem with initial wait time, except we were taken to a booth. They apologize and were very accommodating and fixed the problem within about 10 minutes. As apologetic as they were, this made our wait time about 40 minutes total and I was specific with my request for a table in the first place.  Our appetizer was out almost immediately after ordering, but entrees took quite a while. It was a Saturday night and they were pretty busy, so understandable to a point. I ordered pizza and half the pizza was soggy. I couldn't eat it. Also described as a \"flatbread\" pizza and the crust was very thick. Wasn't too impressed. All of this and I still would have probably given 4-4.5 stars, except as I am leaving the restroom while we're getting ready to leave I hear a waitress loudly complain, \"I like how this guy in a wheelchair passes me and says 'excuse me!' \"  I know my dad, and I'm sure he did say excuse me. He would not have said it rudely, he probably said it loudly because it was VERY loud with music and lots of people. He did not ask to be in a wheelchair nor is he in it because he's lazy. While I understand in a fast paced restaurant like that, waiting is probably stressful and any obstacle or something that throws off your groove is frustrating,  but that was extremely offensive. You never know who is in ear shot so I'd advise management to bring this to their wait staffs attention.  That said, the manager was extremely apologetic with the initial table issue, our waiter was great considering how busy they were, and both my dad and his wife were very happy with their meals.",

    "text": "Cheesecake Factory has been a long time favorite of mine. I have never been disappointed in a meal at any location.   Service can occasionally be slow if you come around 3-4pm which we usually do, probably shift change. We like that time because it's generally not packed yet. Friday and Saturday day evenings you can expect to wait for a seat. National Cheesecake day is also pretty crazy but their service is pretty decent and quick.   Before I cared about what I ate, I used to order off the regular menu. The portions are so large you can split three ways or bring home leftovers...the leftovers taste even better sometimes! I still LOVE the avocado egg rolls and the sauce that comes with them. Must try! The bread they bring is always good as well. This time the bread was nice and warm. The brown bread and sourdough are equally delicious.   Skinnylicious menu- this is the menu I usually pick from now. The servings are more normal and the calories are MUCH lower. Don't let the word \"skinny\" fool you, all the food on this menu is huge on flavor and still satisfying! My favorites are the Mexican lettuce wraps, the flatbreads, burgers and the side salad that comes with the burgers/sandwiches.   Cheesecake- really, you can't go wrong!! I eat off the skinny menu so I can easily eat dessert. Top ones for me are original(so good), chocolate tuxedo mousse, red velvet, and Godiva. If you bring me any cheesecake on the menu I will eat it though. They also have a low carb cheesecake. Or if you're wanting a guilt free dessert you can opt for a bowl of strawberries. I usually bring my cake home to enjoy later.  Ambiance- it's quite pleasant inside although it can get loud. The booths are better than tables. Sometimes with a table you can end up sitting next to some very uncomfortable people who just sit there and awkwardly stare at each other.   Cheesecake Factory has been one of my all time favorite restaurants! Can't go wrong with pages and pages of menu options. There's something for everyone!",

Cheesecake was smaller than average that night and my family wasn't too pleased about that. It was a fine experience. Nothing to write home about.",

The one bad experience I had here was ordering the filet mignon.  I am not a rare kind of person and it kept coming out pink even when I told them they could butterfly it.  It took three times but they FINALLY got it right and the manager even came out and apologized profusely.  You know, things like this happen at restaurants.  While I wasn't excited about it, I took it in stride because it was a very busy Saturday night and every other time I have been here (~dozen) has been great.  What to order: Grilled salmon with spinach, spicy cashew chicken, Kobe beef burger (delish!), tuna tartare, Asian pear martini, pumpkin cheesecake (seasonal makes me cry).  Their menu is so expansive that there are a million things to try, and a million ways to customize each order.  P.S. Be prepared to wait if you go on a Friday/Saturday night unless you make reservations.  It is SUPER packed!",

For starters i would order the spinach and artichoke dip  for drinks order their starwberry lemonade  Then for the entrees I would order the Herb crusted salmon salad if your feeling healthy or the KObe Beef is rediculuosly delicious..    For dessert i usually end it with a traditional starwberry cheescake if it wont fit take it to go and save it for later for a midnight snack..

From Los Angeles to Las Vegas, I have eaten my way across state borders via Cheesecake Factories.  First thing is that this place doesn't take reservations but a table for 2-4 people averages at 15 to 20 minutes of wait time. That's reasonable on a Saturday night, most restaurants are terrible with wait times.  Ordered the Four Cheese Pasta with Chicken and the Red Velvet Cheescake for dessert. Two words: REALLY GOOD. The portions are huge and really you can split it between two people. I had a ton of leftovers for later.  Service was fast and good, the inside of the restaurant is classy and nice, no complaints. Will be back.",

The servers, while nice, are not always the brightest and not always the fastest, but they try hard and the food is good.  I was completely shocked today when I went in and asked for a patio table, as we had been allowed to have our two dogs with us (sitting outside of the patio) for several prior visits.  An older lady with a fake tan, a lot of make up, and a shorter blonde bob was completely rude about it and eventually pointed me in the direction of a manager, who was nicer but said only service dogs were allowed and, to my comment that we had been allowed there w/ our dogs many many times before, \"Well, I'll have to train my staff better.\"  It may seem like a small sticking point, but I will not be returning to this or any CCF in the future.  Arbitrary rules and rude employees are not my thing.",

Not make a new salad, not take the salads back and toss it in, just bring out the chicken in a bowl.....

    "text": "I like coming here between lunch and dinner rush. You usually get seated pretty quickly. I've been here several times and the servers have always been friendly. The food always comes out the way it should, but there seems to be some consistency issues as far as how often the servers check up on you. Some seem to just disappear for a while and you end up flagging down the next one you see to get a refill.  Not a deal breaker for me but I don't like troubling someone else's server. I give this place a 4 for food value and service.",

No attitude but did not check on us at all and didn't make sure we had all we needed.. Waited crazy long for bread and even had to hunt them down for more bread.. It seems they're trained this way. Today I watched my waitress play in her hair for 4 whole minutes before grabbing my bread.. Let me tell you.. Disgusted isn't even the word.. Anyways, the hostess's are always nice to us if that counts for anything. I'll be checking out the Factory closer to my home next time and I'd advise everyone to find another also.",

    "text": "Okay so this review is all over the place, bare with me. First off let me immediately shout out Kevin for being nothing less than awesome. Overall a 3, I'll throw a 5 in to the equation for how they handled their crappy Sunday services. 4 for how the food was because it was just fine. We show up on Easter with no wait and last minute plans so I was pleasantly surprised to find and get a perfect outdoor patio table immediately for 4, at 11:00 and then... no one shows up for a solid 10 minutes for drinks or anything. There's 3 other tables patiently waiting with us so I finally go to get someone when a manager sees me coming. She says someone will be right there which ended up being her and another manager...so Cecil(I believe?) comes over super polite and takes our order, drink and food. Food comes out and the order is wrong. I tell the girl we ordered the brioche French toast and she starts to walk away,  I say we can keep this one(the child's brunch) it's fine she says hold on and I say uhh ok or you can walk away while I'm speaking to you (yes I'm a little feisty now) she comes back and says I was just checking the order I said yeah and walked away right when I was speaking which was super rude. Fast forward to Kevin, he hears my comments, comes over, and takes our table right away from there on out it was perfect! I must've made a stir  because the original manager came over and ended our service with 3 complimentary cheesecakes and a brioche French toast on them. I am impressed that they took responsibility for their slacking but man they really could've saved like $40 with their better communication skills and personable etiquette(cough cough server girl) I'm serious that if/when I go back I'll ask for Kevin because I could be wrong but I don't think he had responsibility for us and really stepped up.",

    "text": "This Cheesecake Factory is in a great location right off of the 215 and Green Valley. Lots of available parking, comparatively speaking to the Summerlin location at Boca Park. We arrived at 6:30pm this Friday night and waited for about 30 minutes. Even though it was really busy, none of the servers seemed to be running around with no remorse for guests who were waiting in the lobby/hostess area. I've been to Cheesecake Factory's in the past where this has happened.  After we sat down we were greeted by our waitress Andrea R. Very knowledgeable, very friendly and patient. DEFINITELY, three important qualities needed for working here as a server.   We started with avocado egg rolls and buffalo blasts. Avocado egg rolls, as always were fantastic. Buffalo blasts were great as well, however it seems there's a little too much extra breading around the outside. I'm sure for the cooking style it's beneficial, and they are still very delicious otherwise and definitely a sufficient enough portion.   Since the dishes are so plentiful, I chose to order an additional appetizer, the Crabcakes. They were fantastic (even though I only enjoyed one of the three) and served fairly well. The only adjustment to this dish I would make is how the Crabcakes are served. They are presented on a bed of Chinese noodles (little foam type noodles). As you cut through the Crabcakes the noodles stick to the Crabcake and it changes the consistency of the bite. The crabcake itself was DELICIOUS. But, it would have been far better if I didn't have to fight noodles through every bite!   After dinner I had the Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Cup Ripple Cheesecake and it is wonderful. Not too sweet, very satisfying if you're a chocolate lover.   The service here is excellent, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere like any Cheesecake Factory is comfortable. I will come back here again and I would recommend any one else too as well.",

Total Time was 2.5hrs!! Ridiculous!  The amount of time we sat waiting for food and checks was unacceptable.  Our food also came out in pieces instead of at the same time.  My order was wrong, she would come and check on us so quick and rushed. so I could send it back.  Never brought more bread nor asked if We wanted another drink, however did bring sodas to the table a few times. But dropped them off and dashed away.   My check, after waiting forever, was wrong then she ran MY card for someone else's bill on top of Mine.   Worst part is, when another waitress came to help, she told her \"I got them\" which clearly she did not.  Unhappy and starving as the meal was inedible for me. Boxed it to bring to my dogs.",

I came back up to tell her we did not receive a buzzer. She assured me it would not be a problem. We waited 20 minutes and 4 other parties that came after us were seated before us. We had asked for a larger table, but they ended up giving it to two other people who came after us.  The service was prompt with taking our order but the food was painfully slow coming out, I know it's not the servers fault but time wise it was unreasonable.  I asked for buffalo sauce and blue cheese three times. We actually ordered food to go for our kids which came out before our meal did.  I did leave a note for the manager to call me, since we were already here for two hours. No phone call or any type of communication. The service has really gone down hill which is really sad, because it was our go to.",

When you don't want a big fuss expensive meal that includes dressing up, but want one step up from Olive Garden, The Cheesecake Factory fits the bill perfectly. Come here if you're in a group, as you WILL find something for everyone. Dress up or down, come any time of day or evening, you'll always feel welcome.   I like this location best. Most times I've had to wait for a table, but this time I did not. It was 11am on a Friday. Was accommodated with a larger booth to seat myself, my hot wife, her mom and her scooter, and Baby2.   Two times ago I had the steak, and I believe it was THE best steak I've ever had. I usually go with tacos or a burger. Today I went with one of the lunch salads with chicken.  Portions are large. We always have leftovers. I have never once been disappointed with The Cheesecake Factory, and I've tried many different items. The Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake is my favorite dessert.   The food is always served timely, drinks are always filled timely, staff is always friendly, helpful, efficient. Dessert is a MUST. Plus whatever that brown bread is they serve, good grief, that is good bread.  Will return, would def recommend",

I said yes I would. Once seated we order some spaghetti for my 4yr old. Once we all get the food his spaghetti is bowtie pasta, so my son did not want it cuase he wants spaghetti.

I think we got there sometime around 8 p.m. and it was still poppin' in there. It was a Tuesday! How crazy is that? But luckily for us, there's a separate spot for people who are just needing that sweet, sweet fill of their creamy cheesecake to go. A couple was standing directly in front of the counter so we asked them politely to move. There really should be stadium seating in the lobby when you're waiting because that's how many people are standing aimlessly around not really aware of their surroundings. We finally wiggled our way through to order the strawberry cheesecake. If you're feeling adventurous, the really have so many options to select from, even a cinnamon bun one that my husband was begging me for. But my heart and my eyes truly were already set for that strawberry cheesecake slice.  For once in our lives, we split something. Even after taking the cheesecake home (took us about 10-15 minutes to get home), the whipped cream, strawberry coated in more strawberry sauce and the creamy, delicious cheesecake were all still in tack. Hallelujah!   This place really is always consistent for me when I make my way over. The food is great, the cheesecake is even better, and I've never really had an issues with staff.",

The menu has so many items that it can be a bit overwhelming.  I got the shrimp and chicken gumbo this time.  Very generous serving size, I couldn't finish it.  It comes with a healthy scoop of either white or brown rice in the center of a large bowl filled with the gumbo.  Tasty stuff!  The other menu item I really like here for lunch is the Seared Tuna Takaki Salad.  Lots of seared tuna sliced and served on a bed of mixed greens.",

While I generally rate the TCF as three stars, this particular one had a few menu items that I've not seen at other Cheesecake Factories (in other areas of the country). There were several chicken and fish dishes that were unique. There may be other things as well, but it's a huge menu and my goal was not to compare every item. I ordered the Chicken Bellagio which was delicious. Their salads we also a step up from any other CF I've eaten at. And they were HUGE. Definitely enough for more than one meal and the quality of ingredients was top-notch. Service was friendly and quick. As usual we were too full for cheesecake, but it is to die for. Worth checking out even if you're not a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory.",

I wouldn't say it's the best value for your money.   I had the orange chicken and it was adequate to quench my appetite. The rice was a little dry for my liking, but the chicken tasted great.  I wouldn't recommend it for your first dish, but if you're an orange chick connoisseur feel free to try it for the experience.   I've saved the best for last, this dish is something you need to try. The Avocado egg roll combine with the sauce complement each other, providing you with a unique taste you'll enjoy.",

    "text": "Maybe it's the memories, but I love everything about the Cheescake Factory.  In olden times, I used to go to the one in Beverly Hills, and got some of my first \"gourmet\" cheesecake there.  Yes fellow Yelpers, cheesecake used to be one flavor only, cheesecake flavor!  I also ate my first noodle koogle there, like yummy rice pudding with noodles!  So it's no surprise that we manage to visit a Cheesecake Factory everytime we come to Vegas.  This time we were out running errands, and pulled in to the restaurant at 5pm, seeking an early dinner.  Lo and behold, they have a Happy Hour from 4pm-6pm that we never noticed before, and we were able to grab seats with no wait at a high table near the bar.  We were presented with their sumptuous Happy Hour menu.  I got a house Margarita, and then ordered Dynamite Shrimp and my honey got Southern Fried Chicken Sliders.  We had friendly service, and the food arrived in a timely manner while we devoured some of the delectable house bread.  We relaxed and chatted about our busy day, while the Happy Hour tables filled in quickly.    We literally gasped when the food arrived, I had forgotten that the portions were so big!  We enjoyed about half of our servings, and then even ordered Roadside Sliders to go.    The jewel in the crown was, of course, the cheescake.  My honey chose lemon-raspberry, since I had done the honors last time we were at Cheescake Factory, and gotten Dulce de Leches.  It arrived with a spectacular mountain of whipped cream and a small pool of rasberry!  We set to work, but also had some of this sweet treat leftover.  Our waiter nicely packaged up the leftovers in very sturdy recyclable plastic containers and bagged them in the signature Cheesecake Factory bag.  When we left, it looked like we had shopped til we dropped.",

I was ready to leave 25+dollars on a $62 dollar bill, however, as we wait to order cheesecake to go and cash out - our server never returned. 5 minutes became 15 minutes and so on. Finally I left 6 dollars and ordered cheesecakes separately from the to go counter. The server came to our \"area\" but never came back to collect our check or see if we needed anything else. Next two visits were to go online orders. Both times I arrived to pick up order and there is no one there to help - the hostesses stare at me, but never offer to call someone so me and other guests just wait and wait. When this woman finally comes over, same woman both times, she's acts like she's working there by force, like someone has a knife to her neck. No smile, no customer service, no apologies for the wait. Management needs to observes these practices and step in. My favorite place, just not this location.",

I was at work craving cheesecake one day and noticed Door Dash had a promotion for free delivery.  I didn't feel right just eating dessert for lunch so I ended up ordering an entree as well.  I must say the food was pretty good.  I'm guessing they amped up their menu/recipes because a few years ago the only thing they had going for themselves was the dessert.  The entrees always lacked flavour and substance, but I was satisfied with what I got that day.  I ordered some sort of Cilantro-Lime chicken dish, but I am unsure of the exact name.  I tried to find it on their menu, but maybe it was seasonal?  Either way, good on you Cheesecake Factory.  Maybe now I will stop in for everything you have to offer instead of the cheesecake.  Forgot to mention the entrees are very overpriced and the lunch menu sucks.",

I figured the first time it was just one of those days where things were just crazy, we have all had them, so I let it go.  However when you have two bad experiences in less than two months it's no longer just one of those days.  We say we have a party of 7 so you would understand if things were slower, however after we ordered it took over an hour to get our food, and than it didn't even come out all together.  Some of us had to wait another ten minutes while others were ashamed to be eating but didn't want it to get cold.  But wait more....  The food was cold for many of the meals and after we all had food we did not get service again unless we waived down someone.  But don't worry we got our check and of course we were charged for a big party service.  Well I can tell you we didn't enjoy our meal the service or the lack of attention we were given!!!  We will not eat here again.  Now I know it will not hurt them if they lose a few customers however it will save me from wasting my money on bad food, horrible service and  just plain my time!!!  Eat there at your own risk but know your time and food experience will be wasted on such a bad chain restaurant.",

    "text": "Went here just a couple of days ago for my first time. i'll start out with the service first. Our waitress was friendly, funny and on the ball! There was never a moment during our entire meal that we were sitting there waiting for her to show up to refill a drink or help us. And I also want to make note of the fact that each waiter/waitress was dressed in white from head to toe and not one uniform that we saw was out of place. Each person was dressed perfectly without a stain or blemish on their clothing. And for anyone that has worked in food service you know this isn't an easy thing to do.   We ordered appetizers to start out the meal, crab wontons and the warm crab artichoke dip. OMG let me tell you what both of the appetizers were amazing. The crab artichoke dip was perfectly hot temp wise, seasoned perfectly and there were tons of lump crab pieces in it, came with a toasted garlic sourdough bread what a perfect combo. The crab wontons also came out a perfect temp and that pop of fresh green onion flavor combined with the sweet spicy dipping sauce was to die for.   My husband ordered the filet mignon, it came with sweet potato fries, onion rings and he added a side of steamed asparagus. I myself ordered the factory combo that came with the steak diane, shrimp scampi and their house mashed potatoes. For me the steak was tasty and cooked perfectly, the shrimp however I felt was a tad over cooked and i've had far better scampi's from other restaurants, not that it was awful, just could have been better. Now the mashed potatoes, sweet baby jesus these things were delightful, they used red potatoes and there were still nice random lumps of potato throughout which I enjoy, the seasonings they used were on point and I just couldn't stop eating them. My husband said that his filet was perfectly cooked and that his whole meal was tasty, he even proclaimed that it was one of the best filet's he's ever had.   Now for the cheesecake he ordered the lemon raspberry and I got the red velvet. Let me tell you what that red velvet cheesecake is amazing, I have an affinity for anything red velvet and am quite stringent on my standards of a good red velvet. The cake itself was moist and tasty and when surrounded by layers of cheesecake and crusted with white chocolate curls and garnished with real deal whipped cream this stuff is the business. I would go back just for the cheesecake.",

This kid just verbalized it, that's it.  Now if it was a birthday, I'm sure there would have been a big deal made.... Guess what?  Achieving each year in marriage is way more of an accomplishment than aging.  I felt slighted and I think NEXT YEAR we will start a new tradition at a different restaurant!  Just because you get a different waitress does not mean your special day shouldn't be special.  Sorry but train your \"I've only been here for 3 month\" juvenile waiters to be compassionate.  Oh and nice how if you linger a little they start \"dropping hints\" .... Just a little compassion and patience would have gotten our server our normal 30% anniversary tip.  But he only got 20%.",

We ordered the flat bread with pears, blue cheese, pecans, and baby spinach. It was good but the portion was pretty small. We also ordered the herb crusted salmon salad. I expected the salmon to be warm but it came out cold. Most salmon salads I'm used to the salmon is nice and warm and cooked medium but it seems like cheese cake factory's salmon was pre-cooked, over cooked and sat in a refrigerator until served. Our waiter seemed like he was in a rush and was not attentive.  Overall I'd rather choose a mom and pop shop spend the same amount of money for better food.",

If I do come here I usually have a couple items from their small plates section and a slice of cheesecake to go.  I love their Tex Mex egg rolls and their clam chowder!   They serve the clam chowder on Fridays and it's really good! I always get a bowl and eat it with the bread basket.   I've tried a few of their entrees and when I saw what I was paying for, it definitely made my meal a bit less enjoyable.  Their wait staff is usually very nice and professional but nothing extraordinary.   And PS their red velvet cake cheesecake is NOT as good as everyone claims. Way over rated.  Try Kaluah cream, Dutch caramel apple streussel, lemon raspberry, white chocolate raspberry truffle, or tiramisu! They all have something more than just the cream over a crust.",

    "text": "This particular location brings back the first time I ate here:  I am down with the swirl, have jungle fever, a checkerboard chick, and all other silly names people come up with to express that they are open to all types of races. I love all guys--black, white, Asian, Hispanic, Middle Eastern, European, tall, short, skinny, heavy, muscular, etc. I have no specific type. If you're hot, you're hot! RIGHT? So, one of my friends started this interracial meetup group and at the time I was NOT interested in dating. I am happiest being a loner. She talked me into accompanying her to the Cheescake Factory with the rest of the group that signed up. Now, I have enough common sense that groups like this rarely turn out the way you want because for one thing people in their 30s just don't sign up for stuff like that.  This was a Monday evening (happy hour) and it was fairly crowded. We were waiting for the RSVP's to show up and it was starting to crowd. While waiting a few males showed up and I could tell they were NOT her type. She was looking extremely irritated and I was having a blast, watching it all go down. LOL.... This man in his late 40's showed up and without any kind of greeting she jumped up from her seat and said, \"How old are you?!\" After he reluctantly said 47, she made it clear that this group was for no one over 40. I felt bad for him as he walked away and I secretly hoped he didn't return to shoot up the restaurant. Another male approached us wearing coke bottle glasses, a striped stained polo shirt, dirty, baggy bum jeans, and velcro snapper shoes. He looked just like Robin Williams in \"ONE HOUR PHOTO.\" To make matters worse, he was hoarding several overused Walmart bags full of personal property! Maybe he thought he was gonna get lucky and have a place to stay tonight?!  She tried to eliminate him by asking his age. He was a smart man, and he lied. Haha.....  Out of no where, I could see her hopes rising when two extrememly tall white males entered the restaurant. The kind of lads you see posing in an Abercrombie ad. She jumped up immediately and said, \"Are you here for the meetup group?!\" They looked surprised and said no. She slumped down like she had just completely given up. Inside, I was cracking up!   The happy hour menu is extremely cheap, nearly half off so I ordered a few appetizers. I got the calamari which is lightly breaded and extremely tender and juicy. It comes with 2 different dipping sauces, but the calamari is so good it can stand on its own with a little lemon juice. I like ordering off of their SKINNYLICIOUS menu which are items that are healthy and less calorie. The Arugula Salad containing Arugula, Marcona Almonds, Golden Raisins, Parmesan, Lemon and Olive Oil.....is sooooooo light and refreshing and is a great accompaniment to something that is fried.   So I sat there, watching some people make a connection and others look like they were ready to go. I chose to sit in a nuetral seat, meaning I sat between two females so that no one assumed I wanted to pair up. I wasn't there for a love connection--just a really yummy meal. This evening turned out to be hilarious--at my friends' expense. She didn't find anyone that fit her type.  Oh well! I left with a delicious OREO COOKIE CHEESECAKE! That's the ultimate love connection!",

Huge menu and portions, friendly service, food typically delivered to the table quickly and as ordered, and a lot of dessert choices...of course!  The addition a while back of the Skinnylicious menu is appreciated; we often choose one appetizer and one main course and split the two as our lunch.  Then a slice of cheesecake to go for breakfast the next morning.  Drink prices (especially the bellini or other speciality options) are ridiculously expensive so we tend to shy away from the adult beverages.  We prefer this location over Cesar's Mall because fewer tourists, less wait for a table, and certainly time saved because there's no maze to find it in the first place.",

    "text": "This Cheesecake Factory sucks. Ain't no other way to say it. Let me explain why.  I pull into the parking lot and am waiting on my wife to show up as she's on her way. I call and speak to \"Frank\" who tells me the wait list is only 5 minutes. I'm only 5 spaces from the front door and can see both front doors so...I'm thinking we're going to be good to go. Well 4 min later we're walking in the door and I get told the wait is now 20 minutes. Wow, that's quite a jump in only 4 minutes and there wasn't a horde of people rushing the door. Either someone can't count or someone was lying...got a hunch the counting ability is just fine....  So we get on the list, get our pager and then cool our heels outside. And outside stinks. Literally stinks. Like has anyone emptied the trash by the benches? Finally after a 25 min wait someone comes out and calls for us by name...the pager never did go off. I got the excuse that it doesn't work outside. Hmm, I guess having equipment with a range of 100 ft from the base station is asking too much.   So we finally get seated. And service...well, it was slow. You wait for bread. You wait for drinks. You wonder if the waiter went to the bar to watch the baseball game on TV. You wonder if there will ever be peace in the Middle East. And then you get to place an order.  When you finally get your food well quite frankly it sucks. My soon to be 3 year old wanted chicken strips and he wanted apple juice. He picks up the juice, starts to move the straw to his mouth and is rewarded with an apple juice shower as the lid was not snapped all the way down on the cup. Nice...now I got a soggy kid. And that soggy kid ate some of the french fries but spit out the chicken. As for my wife, she ordered Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta. She ate about 5 bites before she pushed it away. And I ordered a Mexico City Chicken dish that was marginally passable, but after a couple of bites it left my mouth feeling...well it's starchy...or like it's powdery..it's just weird. 2 hours after leaving the place my wife and I still have this strange aftertaste from their food. I've never really had an aftertaste like this before. Again it's just weird.   From walking in the front door until we left took almost 2 full hours. We spent $80 and ended up leaving well over 3/4 of our food for Republic Services to send to the Apex landfill. I can write that it sucked, but quite frankly that's understating just how bad it was.   My wife said to show mercy and give 2 Stars? Not a chance. If it sucks it sucks. Call it as I experience it and be done with it. 1 Star. And when you see penquins inside the gates to Hades, you might see me darken their doors again. Until such time...oh no Boo-Boo. Ain't going back here even if you tried to drag me in.   (With apologies to my wife who had a rough day and I thought a good meal with cheesecake might brighten her day, but instead these jackasses made it even worse! I waited a while to write this one so I could cool off but needless to say I was not happy when I left).",

I have to agree with other reviewers it's time for corporate management to take a look at who they have managing this place.  We got to the restaurant, after we talked my co-workers husband into coming here kicking and screaming b/c they had had such a horrible experience at this location in the past that he vowed never to return, and asked to be sat outside. Guess what? No outside seating was available. WHAT? #epicfail!!!  Even if you don't have someone to cover the tables outside-FIND SOMEONE. [Strike 1] It's 11:30 am during the week, someone will take the table, make it happen. Instead we got shoved into a very small booth in the corner, where there was a waiter [Strike 2]. I'm a small person, 5'3 and it was a tight squeeze for me.  They have a new Skinny-licious menu which is the only reason, besides their divine brown bread, that they are on the board. Everything is under 590 calories-they don't tell you the fat grams...so they are on their way but not there yet.  If you have a craving for some good food and you are in this area try Settebello Pizza, The BBQ joint by GVR, or the Italian restaurant in GVR -skip this place and skip China Grille.",

We went as a big group and sat at a round table.Our server was cordial and attentive and as a former CCF employee I know the whole drill they must do. She missed a couple of things here and there but who cares...I never agreed with their long introduction anyways.  Our order placement was simple and it went smooth..for the most part. She forgot to take my order and had to call her back ..no biggie it happens to be best.  I really liked the fact that they have a Skinny \"B\" menu (as my gay best friend calls it) and I can get some very tasty food without feeling like I will end up like Jabba the Hutt. I had the tartar and it was delicious, fresh and tasty! Small yes..but that's the price of low calories.  To close my meal I ordered the margaretha flat bread and it was delicious as well.. after eating my stuff of course I started eating my friends food and had a taste of the HUGE nachos..and when I say huge I really mean it..that was a mega plate ..priced very good as well!  Salads were big and tasty! In general, CCF always tastes good , from its bread to the desert.  Our server was super nice and attentive.she even split the bill in 8 without a single issue. I really liked that touch.  As long as there is not a long waiting time (which there usually is) I will continue to come to their spot due the ambiance, music ,service and of course food. Well done CCF",

We went for lunch it was pretty busy but we got sat immediately.They accommodated the whole family as far as seating including my newborn which some restaurants do not have proper seating for. As I'm looking through the menu I see a wide variety of different options they have a pretty big menu! My mother in law ordered appetizers she ordered two different artichoke dishes one was the fire roasted fresh artichoke and the other was fried artichoke I'd never tried it so id figure what the hell ill try it. Hmmm I guess I'm not a fan of artichoke I didn't like it at all yuck which sucks because there were a lot of different appetizers that sounded tasty that i would have ordered such as avocado eggrolls, chicken pop stickers, fried Mac and cheese, tex mex eggrolls,crab wontons or the crab cakes hmm I might have to come here and just order appetizers one day lol. Now for my main dish I decided to stick with what I remember ordering and liking years ago the fettuccine Alfredo I did the lunch special since pasta is filling I ordered the tropical tea to go with it. The fettuccine was ok not great just ok I remember it being better but I guess they changed the ingredients, the tea was refreshing and delicious. My hubster and mother in law were happy with their dishes my hubster got the BBQ hamburger and she got some type of salad.   It pains me to rate it 3 stars because I'm pretty sure if I had ordered something else and a different appetizer it would of been 4 stars because the service was awesome and I just chose the wrong dish.",

    "text": "A nice date night visit to Cheesecake Factory at the District on Saturday.  Only waited 15 minutes to get seated.  On a Saturday night-not too shabby.  The waitress was pleasant and very attentive.  We ordered the crab balls and they were so good along with the bread I was already getting full. LOL  For dinner I had went all out for probably the most fattening thing and got the fettuccini with chicken and sun dried tomatoes.  My BF got his normal - orange chicken.  His seemed too sweet for me but he liked it.  We both LOVED mine.  Amazing!  I think he ate at least a third of mine. haha  We ordered the pumpkin cheesecake to go and it was fabulous of course.  Both were way more than enough.  Maybe next time we will share the fettuccini! ;)  At the end of the meal we both thought \"why dont we come here for often?\"  The prices are good, the ambiance is ok-maybe a little loud, but the food is fantastic!  Big fan!",

And the shrimp is huge. Some people don't like it but I love it- it's comfort food to me.  Other than the Shrimp Scampi I don't think I'd go to Cheesecake Factory. That's the reason for the three stars. It is mass chain, so nothing is really special about it.",

I got the Samosas (on the app menu) and my husband opted for a basic burger and fries.  I had iced tea and my husband ordered a green tea which was A-MAZING.  I wished I had ordered that and I hope I remember next time.  It came with a sprig of fresh mint and was just the perfect flavor.  The samosas were wonderful and came with a really yummy cilantro sauce for dipping.  I could have used some more sauce though. (Not that they were skimpy with it, just that I like a good dipping sauce LOL).  My husband liked his burger, it was nothing special but he was just in the mood for a basic burger so he was happy.  The fries were just ok.  Service was quick and very competent. We'll be back when we're in the neighborhood.",

The overall feel of this place is great, yes it is a chain and yes they all look the same but one difference with this place in comparison to other chains is that they are always spot on with the food.   The other thing about this place is that it is obviously named due to it's insane cheesecake options but i never have room for cheesecake when we are done eating here due to the amount of food you are given when you order a normal size meal.   On this specific trip the food was fast, delicious and more than enough, i think for the time being this is our location of choice if we are going to be hitting the cheesecake factory.",

    "text": "It's really hard NOT to love Cheesecake Factory. This place has been an old favorite from years ago. The food is usually consistent for the most part and the portions could feed a small  village. What fluctuates seems to be service. Tonight wasn't bad as we had a newbie who had some things to learn but very polite. Funny how I sometimes expect a certain level of service at established restaurants and forget that every server has to start somewhere. After limiting myself to one slice of their signature warm brown bread, I feasted on the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. My fave! Large shrimp in a flavorful, Jamaican jerk-like sauce alongside white rice, fruity mango salsa, black beans and sweet plantains. I was a little piggy and ate all the succulent shrimp...because I could :) The sauce was plenty if you want to mix your rice into it. The other item ordered at our table that I usually get was the Crusted Chicken Romano in a creamy white Alfredo sauce (not tomato as it shows on menu...get the white, it's better) Served with pasta. Love how thin and crispy the chicken was in the Romano cheese crust. I recommend getting the sauce on the side or separating the chicken to keep it from getting soggy. We also like the frozen mango raspberry smoothie that is just like taking a bite of fresh ripe mango. Very refreshing but will fill you up. I don't recall having a bad meal here and the great part is there's something for everyone in your group and again portion sizes are big enough to share or take home for another meal.",

Two of our menus at the table were greasy. There were some crumbs on the table.  The server Chris greeted us and listed the specials.  He brought our drink orders right away.  I always get strawberry lemonade $3.95.  It very sour and sweet!  He said he was going to come right back with bread.  He came back to take our order, no bread.  After a while he brought us water along with our bread. The Thai wraps $13.50 were nicely plated and arrived just as I finished my first piece of bread.  I didn't have any, but the boys finished it all and liked it. We were given hot towels after the finger food appetizers!   +!  My pasta da Vinci $16.95 tastes good as always.  Slightly creamy, chicken, mushrooms, fresh Parmesan.  I prefer to come in during lunch to order the smaller portion.  Cheesecake Factory servings are generous. The food here is always consistent, location to location.  The service was timely. Total for 3 of us with alcohol, appetizer, and a dessert was $146.75.",

If you decided to get a strawberry lemonade make sure to ask for water because it's overly  sweet. Entrees I got the luau salad it's amazing very healthy and he got the teriyaki chicken so good comes with your choice of brow., Or white rice .

The food, well it wasn't bad, nothing special. He had the Shepherds pie and I had the Chicken and biscuits. Maybe it was just us, not use to eating rich foods. Both of us felt a bit bloated after we ate. His didn't have much flavor, mine was just okay. It's not a bad restaurant, just not for us.",

This is AFTER we sat for 8 minutes with no hello. Suzy finally appeared. Asked her if the large table in this section was going to hinder our experience? She soooooooo snotily replied she could move us if we wanted. Continued a very condescending attitude. This was BEFORE the waffle issue. Manager offered something else, we declined. Didn't want FREE food. We wanted lunch and cheese cake. We got neither. Will not return.",

It was lunch time and the place was packed but even so the wait for a table was only a couple minutes. Our server was very nice. She brought me my most favorite tea super fast..its a passion fruit tea that is just amazing. She even bought my little guy an apple juice in a sippy cup. I had the angel hair pasta with shrimp and he had a grilled cheese and fries. Both came out very fast..which is good since they have some really good bread there that can fill you up. She boxed everything up and even put my tea in a to go cup. Another amazing visit to the factory!",

I am talking about LInda's Fudge Cake, the Tiramisu, the Black Out Cake. These are huge cakes, and very, very good. You just need a full day to let them thaw out as they keep them in the freezer.

They don't tell you a wait time over the phone and they don't take reservations. Even if you call ahead and try to let them know you're willing to drop a couple hundred bucks on a large party (because eating here isn't cheap) they don't respond with anything other than a \"I'm sorry, we don't want to disappoint people by quoting wait times that may not be accurate.\" Well, Cheesecake Factory, you've disappointed me by NOT quoting me wait times. I guess you can't please everybody and in this case I am the one not pleased. WE CALLED THREE TIMES to work with this establishment. We were told three different things. Now, I'm saying one thing.

Plus the tables are way to close together so it feels like I am sitting with strangers. But I know that going into the restaurant, that is why I LOVE the take out option. The food is always hot by the time that I get home so there is no lack of heat or anything like that. It's almost as if I am eating there in the restaurant with the temperature and etc.  The food is always on point.  Food  Chicken Samosas - 5 Stars - Full of Flavor, Nice Portion size, Sauce is to die for.  Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls - 3.5 Stars - The filling needs more seasoning before being wrapped in the rice paper. The sauces can only go so far in seasoning the rolls.  Bread - 5 Star plus - Enjoy the 9 grain bread the most.  Shrimp & Bacon Club - 5 Stars - Love the bacon, shrimp and the sauce. I don't put tomatoes on the sandwich but sub onions and the flavor is so much better.   Fries - Always seasoned wel. Sometimes a little too well.  Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake - 5 Stars  Peanut Butter Cheesecake - 5 Stars  If if wasn't for the take out option I would never dine there. The few times that I have dined in there were no problems. Servers are friendly and helpful. Just not my kind of atmosphere.",

Usually I eat here either to catch up with friends, or if guests staying over wants to try it.  My experience overall has always been good with no complaints on service.   Though their menu is vast I think the entrees seem a bit boring. There seems to be more chicken entrees than anything else. I ordered a chicken shrimp jambalaya. It was good and they were generous with shrimp. Perfect meal for people who likes spice and who's not afraid of carbs.  How can you not leave this place and not order a cheesecake? Well I did that. Between the appetizers and my entree I was way too stuff to order one. It's ok. I'm sure the raspberry white chocolate cheesecake will always be there for me.",

The server wasn't paying attention messed up the split checks and how it was charged. The food was delayed between people and they forgot my cheesecake. Cheesecakes were amazing.

If you love a variety of food with spot on flavor or if you just have an insatiable sweet tooth go to Cheesecake Factory. Personally, I love their thai chicken lettuce wraps as an appetizer.

And you can tell coz the edges and the middles part of pepperonis are totally black. If you're the chef and the server/waitresses, would u still serve it?. It's not just over cooked its totally burnt... so think about that. Their utensils like knives, forks and spoon are just sitting on top of the table, who knows how dirty the tables are. Should be placed on top of a cloth or just leave it  on top of the plate and napkins... how DIRTY. When we complained abt the pizza the waiter just said do u want the manager... no apologies or like let me just get U another one. My son ended up only eating the pizza itself. We don't want to re order it since we're in a hurry... their water tastes so bad too. And the mugs needs to be replaced you can tell they have been using it for more than 2 decades lol!!! So experience for me is one star. Will never go back to this location. Ceasars palace would probably be better. Don't go to this location so disappointing..",

At first the waitress was great but then for some reason she became very rude.  My husband was sitting across the table from me and each time she would, I don't know what you would call it ... but bump into him. At first I thought \"it happens, I mean we were both siting at the end of the table\" but I watched it happen over and over again. At one point she knocked the spoon and knife off the table on to the floor, I mean you could here it. Even the 2 women next to us looked. No apology, nothing. I would have said something but our family was enjoying their dinner and it wasn't the time or the place at that point.  We won't be back.",

Had various waiters help us then after 20 minutes of waiting watching others getting their food , people that had arrived after us, our food arrived with apologies that a take out order took all their time.   The enchiladas we had ordered were cold. After waiting another 5 minutes to flag down a waiter we were told they could reheat it.  They took the food away and brought the salad bowls back asking us if we wanted to eat that while we waited. They had offered my salad to my guest and hers to me, wtf... I then told them to start from scratch and remake it all and she proceeded to look at me with a totally bewildered look. I repeated this and she just went \"but, but,but\". Having had enough and 40 minutes into this circus I left 5 bucks for the ice tea and told her to tell the manager to get their s$$t together then left. Who has hours to mess around at lunch.",

It's on the opposite side from most of the shopping so parking is easy. Just like most of their locations they have an enormous amount of seating and outdoor seating as well. The patio is a nice option when the weather is nice.  The menu has a large amount of options and a large variety of options as well. There should be something here to please everyone. I like that a group could come in and order completely different foods. Surprisingly, everything I've had is really good. They are one of the few places that can pull off a large menu without sacrificing taste. The portions are always big enough to make into two meals. I love fun lunch leftovers.  This is one of the few restaurants that make it easy for someone on a diet if you aren't looking to treat yourself. The Skinnylicious menu has some great options and the calories are listed on the menu. They couldn't make it easier for someone counting calories.  The cheesecake lives up to the hype and just like the regular menu there are a ridiculous amount of options. My favorite is the Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake.   Pricing is reasonable for the portion sizes. As I mentioned, most entrees are big enough to be two or three servings for the average person.  I've been to this location many times and service has always been great. Despite the fact that they are always busy it never takes long to get food and drinks are refilled promptly.",

After my wife got food poisoning from this location at Green Valley, I went back to the restaurant to speak with a general manager and she refused to speak with me.  I can't believe how Cheesecake Factory treats their loyal customers, we have been coming to this location for years and brought so many friends there and they did not care about that a bit.  We will definitely never ever return to the Cheesecake Factory again, I will rather go somewhere else and spend my money,where I will be appreciated as a loyal customer .",

Our server Daniel was very nice and poise, looked like he had been serving for years. We started with a CUP of soup, it looked like a regular soup bowl. By the time out entrees arrived, we could barely eat. good thing, because i was so0o disappointed in how my entree tasted. I order a Smokehouse Burger, and it was so0 dry and bland =[ I figured i was a bit out of it, and my taste buds just weren't awake after that AMAZING clam chowder, but no. I brought it all home to my Hubby, and he was confused on when he was going to get some flavor. I don't know if it was an off dish or what, but next time I'm ordering a steak or some pasta, and if they can't get one of those tasting great, then Cheescake Factory will only be for Soup & Cheescake for this family.",

Neither too strong or too soft, just good.  That's what we ate the next day. At home. Because I couldn't bring myself to even attempt the cheesecake, after the buffet we had at the restaurant.  We went unannounced on Valentine's night. The wait was an hour which was understandable.  AVOCADO EGG ROLLS and FRIED MACARONI & CHEESE.  Sound like a lot? No, me either, but I couldn't finish my meal. So I guess it was. We really underestimated those appetizers, because I'm dumb. And honestly that could've been our meal. And I don't why but I keep trying to find a suitable mac and cheese, but I guess I just like it simple. Because anything too fancy just doesn't do it. For me. CAJUN PASTA JAMBALAYA  was the dish across, and the SHRIMP SCAMPI & SALMON was the dish in front. Of me that is.  I know what shrimp and salmon taste like, but That salmon was perfect. Enough for me to mention it again here, I was just pleasantly surprised. Even with how full I was, I dominated that thing. Like a duck. (No chewing) If you've never been, then you should, at least once. It's one of those places that you wish you could call it you're favorite restaurant (because of the decor, the ambiance, the food) but then you see the people you're eating around with, because you decided not to get a booth. And sad face.  But it stills bare mention though, it's just not a place you want to go all the time. Just once in awhile.",

An hour past we still waited 2 hours are creeping by so we ask if our table was ready, no not yet. Still waiting and now 5 kids are getting inpatient and crying they are hungry. Now Im getting upset and whats taking so long to get a table. It seem as if they didn't care I had to ask for a manager to get anything done. The manager did try to make the situation better by comp some food but the damage was done for a 2 hrs and so wait. I with to order a cheesecake for my mother and some man that work there made a comment that I had to pay for that. I just brush it off and reply I know that.

    "text": "Went to this place for lunch and what a mistake that was. I ordered the gluten free skinny ceasar salad. I was happy they had an option for me. I received my salad and 3 bites in I found a BUG in my salad. I was shocked and disgusted. The waiter was shocked as well and took my salad. About 5 minutes later the manager came over and gave me a fake smile and apology that was very procedural. She offered me something else but why on earth would I want anything else from this place. I am very limited as to what I eat and this was one of the only options for me. I sure didn't want another salad with BUGS in it. Yes, I get it- it's lettuce and bugs like lettuce but they should be washing their lettuce more thoroughly to avoid this disgusting situation. I had to sit the rest of the meal while others in the party ate their meals which were not salad. As a person in customer service, the manager did not go out of her way to rectify the situation. She could have offered a discount on the rest of the bill. She took the salad off the bill but of course she would, I did not eat it and this was their fault. When we left the same manager was standing near the exit and she turned her back when she saw us leaving. Did not say another word to us. This is horrible customer service at it's finest. I will not ever go back to this place and urge others to be aware of the BUGS in the salad. To all the restaurants out there, when it is your fault someone's meal goes terribly wrong it is your responsibility to make things right. Had they discounted the rest of the bill or heck even offered to cover the bill themselves maybe I wouldn't have written this review! Customer Service should be a priority to make the customer's want to visit again. Cheesecake Factory ruined my day with my family.",

My experience has been that the cheesecake here is good for dessert.  Fresh, well made, lots of options and flavors, etc....  Bar is good too with good beer and drink options (Fat Tire on tap is always a plus).  Overall design of the restaurant is pleasant, albeit a bit loud due to very high ceilings.  I just always find the menu, which is very large and varied in options and cuisine types, to be very middle of the road for the actual food.  Maybe because this restaurant tries to offer something for everybody - in my opinon, it results in lighty seasoned food (in large portions, in my opinion, that is not objectionable to anyone but just not that interesting.  I did want to really like this restaurant (not typically a huge chain fan, but really like The District and all it offers), but based on my few visits here, I would have a drink or dessert here, but find the main meal options lacking.",

Typically I can't finish my entire meal as the portions are huge and if I want cheesecake then I have to save room. The service is typically adequate to very good, but compared to the Plaza branch I'm used to in KC, MO it is missing a little bit of charm.  A few things I was very happy to see on this trip (October) were firstly a very expansive healthy menu that filled all of mine and my wife's needs and secondly a new cheesecake that was made to have hints of pumpkin pie. Both were welcome additions and both were full of very tasty bites!!  Things that would make this a more regular trip to me and my wife....more draft beer choices and super cold iced draw glasses, and lastly more intimate seating.",

Their avocado eggrolls are yummy and their eggplant parmesan is amazing!!!!! The eggplant is cooked perfectly and is crispy on the outside and tender in the center - not soggy. The pasta for the eggplant parm has pesto in it that is so delicious! Their cheesecake is my all-time favorite dessert ever. OK, some cons to be fair: this location is usually busy, tables are really really close together (feels like you're all in one party with your neighbors), and they do not clean the booth-style seating or their floors very well - you will find bread crumbs 9/10 times because they simply wipe the tables really quick in between patrons and a lot of the the bread crumbs seem to land on the floors/seats. Otherwise, great place to eat! I def. recommend!",

    "text": "TERRIBLE SERVICE: Where do I even start. Firstly, they attempted to seat us to a small table where if we were to have accepted we would have been sitting elbow to elbow to the person sharing the booth seat. No problem, and a quick fix. They quickly sat us at a booth, which was nice and we appreciated that accommodation. 5 minutes later our server D shows up to take our drink order, she grabs our drinks quickly, sets them down, and rushes away. We had in mind an appetizer we wanted to order and that would have been a great time to order however she didn't stop at the table for even a second for us to do that. Another 5-7 minutes later she shows up once more and asks us if we are set to order. As we order she seems rushed, and quickly leaves our table once again. After our appetizer gets to the table brought by I assume a runner she never once came by to ask if we need anything. Here and there she would grab our drinks to refill without asking and wouldn't say a word, never spending even a second at the table to give us a chance to ask for anything. Once our food arrived the runner put our food down and ran off before asking if we needed anything else before I could process that I had blue cheese, and not ranch on my plate. I was expecting our server to show up and ask us how everything was, or to ask if we need anything else but no nothing. Since we were seated near a server station my husband waved down another server who was standing around conversing with another server. She fingered hold on to my husband and finished her conversation. She finally came over and asked my husband if he needed something and when he said we needed a side of ranch, and buffalo sauce she ran off to get it. Another server (still not ours) brought the ranch, and said she'd be back with the buffalo sauce. 2 minutes later, the buffalo sauce finally arrived. After our meals were almost done another server saw that our drinks were low, and offered to refill them. Once completely finished, our server finally arrived and asked about dessert. The check arrived with our to go desserts because we couldn't stand to be in there any longer. Long story short, the service was terrible. My two stars are only for the food, that was better than the service.",

We ordered crab and artichoke dip, which they were out of, so we split the cheese and artichoke dip and a Chinese chicken salad. Both were just ok. I ordered a strawberry lemonade and it was sooooooo incredibly cloyingly sweet.   Also, our server, though nice, left in the middle of our meal and the replacement server didn't come by for a solid 15 minutes. Eh. Not the best experience.",

It was my first time trying something like this at Cheesecake Factory, but since I love Mediterranean food I thought I'd give it a shot. The only downer was that I was seated on the other side of the ice machine and I guess there was a leak because the area under my seat became wet with dirty cold water. I let the waitstaff know and they alerted the manager, but that didn't stop the hostess from seating another group in that same puddle. This is an isolated occurrence, however so I only docked them one star. Generally the dining experience there is exceptional.",

Service ran quite a bit slower than normal; we had to ask auxiliary staff for water and bread to tide us over until our food came. Our server seemed overwhelmed, so that made her more short (but not rude) than maybe she usually is.

Not too rich, and not too far from the classic cheesecake taste.  They can get too far away from cheesecake with stuff like the Oreo cheesecake, I'd rather just have Oreo ice cream at that point.  This CCF is in a great location in the district at Green Valley.  It is your standard CCF with really dim lighting.  Sit outside if you can because it's a lot quitter and scenic.  I tend to try to get Entrees that are more on the exotic side, it tends to pay off better than standard stuff.  The Jamaican Pepper shrimp is a celebration of flavors in your mouth.  I also like to get a post meal alcoholic shake like the flying gorilla.  Then sit around for another hour sipping it to annoy the waiter.",

I highly recommend to get there early if you have big groups. We were only four people and waited 10-20 minutes. You have the option of sitting inside, outside, or whatever is first available. We chose to sit inside.  Once seated, our server, Nathan, came by with waters and bread. The bread basket consisted of sourdough bread, a wheat bread, and white bread. I ordered a raspberry lemonade and it was pretty good. I definitely like the strawberry one better but it's not bad if you want to try something new.  My family and I ordered the avocado egg rolls as our appetizer being that it's our favorite whenever we come. It was perfectly fried and the avocados inside were delicious and ripe.  I chose to order a new dish tonight so I went for the farfalle pasta with chicken and roasted garlic. I'm a huge fan of bow tie pasta so I had to try it. Once I received it though I was a bit underwhelmed. The pasta was cooked perfectly but the chicken was okay. They also left huge chunks of garlic in the pasta so if you're not a garlic fan, ask for it without it. The pasta wasn't horrible but it definitely wasn't the best I've had there. I feel like I've had better farfalle at other restaurants. Besides the pasta, everything relate else was great.    We ordered dessert to go (red velvet cheesecake and cherry cheesecake). Red velvet is THE best! It's part cake and part cheesecake--perfect combo!   Our server Nathan was awesome and made sure we were always taken care of during dinner. It made the experience much more enjoyable. I will be coming back for sure because I just love Cheesecake Factory :)",

I'm horrible at deciding what to eat, and with a million choices it makes it that much harder for me. I looked at the menu for a good 20 minutes. I finally chose the bbq bacon burger. It came piled high with crispy onion rings, bbq sauce and bacon. It was deelicious! I got a side of the ranch to dip my fries into and it's the best Ranch I've ever had. It's garlicky and has a bit of a kick to it. So good. You can purchase a jar to go, FYI. My other half had the pasta carbonara with chicken and he really liked it. Others in our party had bbq chicken pizza, fettuccine alfredo, corn dogs and a club sandwich. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals.   Now you can't go to CCF and not order cheesecake. I spent another 20 mins deciding which flavor I wanted. I finally chose the oreo and it was amazing. I also got to sample the smores, reeses, and banana cream pie cheesecakes. They were all pretty good. The reeses has an over powering peanut butter flavor which I didn't really care for. The smores one was really good and the banana cream was good as well. I can't wait until they have their pumpkin cheesecake. I love that you can walk in and just purchase cheesecake by the slice without having to dine in. I will be back.",

My hubby enjoys a few things, chicken masala, the burgers or the jambalaya are his usual picks. My daughters usually get the kids marinara pasta, the chicken dumplings (an appetizer, but they eat it as a meal) or nachos, which 2-5 can share.  Of course, the cheesecake is what they really want, and it is pretty delicious if I do say, all 3577326786 calories a bite. It's not like we eat cheesecake everyday though, so it's okay. The chocolate lava cake is quite good, as well.  Service has always been consistent and friendly, however, weekend nights be prepared to wait at least 30 for a table. Prices are average for that type of restaurant, a couple cocktails, 4 meals, a cheesecake or ice cream is around $100. Minus tip.  It's s go to for us on a Friday night after the kids sports stuff.  And as the infamous quote by Marie Antoinette says, \"let them eat cake.\"",

Our server had a great sense of humor an made sure our drinks stayed filled, offered more bread and really made the overall experience am enjoyable one even though it seemed like it took the kitchen forever to get our food out.  Once the food came, everything was prepared just as ordered and was good.  I would definitely go back as the food is good and our server, one of the best we have had there in a long time.",

The second time I was hung up on. The third time I spoke to the manager, Ashley(?), and she was abrupt rude and acted as if I was an inconvenience for calling. She transferred me to make the order and the girl who tried to take the order was rude as well. I gave up on calling AS YOU COULD IMAGINE! I love cheesecake factory but this one is just a complete mess. Saving you a trip, people!! I went to Sammy's Restaurant down the street instead and it was great(:",

The food is also pretty good, huge portion!! I can't never finished my food. Cheese bread appetizer for $9 is ridiculous when I comes in 6 pieces and the cheese doesn't even melted all the way.

    "text": "I've been to other locations, but this was my first experience at this Green Valley location. I was pleasantly surprised to only wait 2 minutes for a table. That almost never happens at Cheesecake Factory. That's where the positives pretty well came to an end.   For starters, it took our server almost 15 minutes to see us for the first time. I get that a busy restaurant requires servers to attend to a lot of customers in their section, but waiting 15 minutes just to see us the first time and take drink orders is pretty bad. It also unfortunately set the tone for our service through the rest of our meal.   We started with fried Mac and cheese, which ended up being pretty good. It took a while to get to the table, but it was delicious. I decided to order the tempura fish tacos. Having to decide from 150+ menu items isn't my favorite thing but it is what it is.   Unfortunately, the fish tacos were horrible. The batter wasn't all the way cooked and the fish smelled horrible. I get that you can't expect super fresh fish from a chain restaurant, but it was awful. The pieces of fish didn't even fit in the tiny tortillas they put them in. I could only stomach 2 before calling it quits.   The shortest time between waitress visits was between taking our plates and bringing our check. Needless to say, I won't be back. We were thinking about getting cheesecake for dessert but didn't want to spend another 30 minutes and 10 dollars here. We filled out our check and got out of there.   I take some of the blame for ordering fish tacos, but if Cheesecake Factory can't produce something that at least tastes ok, then take it off the menu....or at least make your service passable. Unfortunate, but that's how it goes sometimes.",

First, the lady didn't even introduced herself that she's our server. She comes around immediately asked me, what will I get to order. Which is good. I gracefully asked her, if theres any favorite that she'll recommend since it's been a while that I haven't been to this location. She said, I have never ate with you or never been with you, so I don't know what you like and you don't like. (Good point) but I mentioned that I haven't been here for a long time.  I normally give good reviews because it's uplifting to have a compliment. but this time I really don't like the service I receive from Sarah. To you,just be polite and respectful. I should have stayed longer and eat with my kids and mom  I was so disappointed and just left. I almost not give a tip but it's a must.  And the avocado roll is great, spaghetti and meatballs for my kids are not warm enough. The only warm food is my mom's order which is the stuffed.  This is my first time to be in this location. The service I got from Cesar's palace-cheesecake factory is way better than this.",

I also ordered the buffalo blasts and bbq ranch chicken salad. If you like buffalo sauce and Bleu cheese- you should definitely try the buffalo blast. They are perfect and so the Bleu cheese is made in house and the perfect combo of creamy and chunky. The salad is like a southwest salad with black beans, corn, avocado grilled chicken and fried onion string. I was too full for a dessert, but super satisfied with my meal.

No matter if it's this location or any other location across the country, Cheesecake Factory is just consistent and delicious.   This place is pretty much a great restaurant that caters to all. You come here and always see large groups of families, especially little ones. If you come for lunch, this seems to be the spot for moms/wife's lunch dates with their friends. High school kids date nights. Or, for myself, just your casual Friday night date spot with the girlfriend.  There is always a line here and usually always a wait. However, it's so big and they have such a big staff and kitchen, the wait is never that long.  The food here seems to always hit the spot. They have something for every taste bud. Not the greatest, but they a pretty good job for every kind of dish for a place that doesn't specialize in one thing. The portions are huge.  Some of my favorites are:  Red Sangria Chinese Chicken Salad Salmon Kale Salad Beet and Goat Cheese Pear Goat cheese flatbread (substitute blue cheese for goat cheese - thank me later) Chicken Nachos Chicken Gyoza  Bang Bang Shrimp and Chicken Orange Chicken Spicy Cashew Chicken Egg rolls  And of course - the cheesecake  Just overall a great spot.",

Excuse me the \"system doesn't recognize me\" because I arrived 15 min. I shouldn't have had that welcoming or the attitude. I would have understood \"the order is almost ready if you could kindly wait \". But, no.    Not only that, but I parked at the parking slot for curbside where you call, pay, and then they come out to bring your order. They never answered.  I drove out of my way to get a cheesecake from the \"cheesecake factory\". But in the future, I will think twice about it.",

    "text": "I am saddened to give a 1 star for Cheesecake Factory.  April 16 went for birthday dinner with 7 people.  Waitress Tina was fabulous.  5 Stars all the way around service food etc.  Since our experience was so well we decided to go again on the 17th this time with 9 people.  Was given a beeper and told 45 minutes. There was a crowd of people Wednesday night but not so many that we had to wait almost 2 hours for a table at which we ourselves suggested to sit outside.  This should have been suggested by the hostess as we several time went in to check on the status of our table. \"Its spring break lots of kids, just 15 minutes, table set up for outside which we could see and then 15 minutes later we are finally seated\"  The music was so loud you couldn't hear your conversations, we asked that it be turned down the lady manager sorry i don't recall her name said of course.  She did not turn down the music we had to go back inside and ask another person if they could turn it down.  Our Waitress was very very good and her service was excellent.  Food came after 40 minutes with us asking why is it taking so long. 3 Poeple ordered a Cajun chicken it came bland there was no seasoning on them at all. Chicken tequeitoes had barely any sauce.  Manager was spoken to about the time issue and the fact she didn't turn down the music when asked.  She said she would take care of our check with a discount.  The check came and there was no discount. Had to be returned for adjustments and then it showed only free drinks.  Mind you some of the guests only had water.  We then made comment about the quality of the food and the lady manager went and got James.  We were not trying to get our meals for free we just wanted them to hear our concerns and that fact we purposely choose this restaurant 2 times in a row. After hearing that we came at 6pm and now leaving at 9pm he comped all our meals which wasn't that much as some only had appetizers.  Needless to say we will not be going to Cheesecake any time soon in the future.",

I had the cheeseburger, which was juicy and filling, with perfectly salted fries. I also had a couple house margaritas, which were the perfect combination of sweet/sour. My wife and her friend split the fried chicken sliders and they were great. Another one of our friends ordered the corn tamale cakes and we all helped;) The Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake was about as good as it sounds-amazing! The Cheesecake Factory is always good, but tastes even better @ happy hour!",

I usually end up getting appetizers as meals every time I go. This time was no different except I added a cup of clam chowder to it. Oh man, that clam chowder was amazing. And filling! I could hardly finish my other food. I got nachos, sweet corn tamale cakes along with the mix of egg rolls (sorry, no picture). Avocado, Cuban, chicken southwest and the salmon one. In my opinion all tasted great except for the Cuban one, didn't care for the ham flavor in it. I just wasn't a big fan of it. Everything else, amazing. This place will always be a favorite of mine.",

We went in 45m early to dine in on something small beforehand and when we inquired about the take-out order it took them 25m to find it so then it wasn't ready on-time.  I wonder how late it would have been if we hadn't gone in early.  Second, the cleanliness of the restaurant was C+ at best.  We were there when they opened and our table had a few small random pieces of food on it.  The silverware also had water spots and scum on them.  The floor under the table next to us had a big brown smear under it that I hope was chocolate.  Third the food was very salty and they hit a big pet peeve of mine which is pepper shakers where the pepper comes out at a trickle.  Fourth, and this is just a matter of taste, the music is all the whiney pitchy stuff that only appeals to a small percentage of the population.  Anyway the only save here was the attitude of the hostesses and waitstaff who were very nice.",

I've started going inside and checking my order before I leave, so I can ask for the items they forgot. (Every time!) It's annoying because they offer curb side takeout but when they forget stuff, you have to wait for them to go back inside and get it.   If I was rating the food, I would give them 5 stars but since I order takeout 95% off the time, my rating is based on the takeout service, which is lacking.   They get super busy, pretty much every day of the week, so be prepared for a wait. They are open until midnight on the weekend and it's way less busy around 10pm.",

The menu at The Cheesecake Factory is very extensive, a bit overwhelming at that! With the menu consisting of just about 20 pages, everyone is bound to find something they'll enjoy. The food is consistent, always fresh, and the portions are ridiculously huge. I always have leftovers for lunch the next day!  A few of my favorite dishes include the Barbeque Ranch Chicken Salad and the Crispy Chicken Costoletta.   If you have room, there are over 50 cheesecakes and various desserts to choose from! We normally come to an agreement (which can be hard) and share a slice! Seriously, after a meal here, a slice of cheesecake will push you to the edge.  During our most recent visit, we received the most outstanding service from Aiden! He was on his A-game from start to finish, exceptional to say the least. He was very informative when we had questions about items on the menu and even recommended a few of his favorites! Aiden was constantly checking up on my family and always made sure that our waters (and bread basket) were filled. Not to mention, he can really carry a tune! We were very impressed! Thank you, Aiden!  Now, if only it wasn't so dark inside the restaurant! The ambience is nice, don't get me wrong, but I wish the lighting wasn't so dim! There was a single light shining down from the high ceiling in the middle of our table, and everyone was taking turns using it to read the menu. I know, it sounds ridiculous, but it's True. With the sun going down sooner in the day, there's not much natural light left to come through the windows before dinnertime.  Overall, great location, great service, and most importantly, great food!",

    "text": "Wow what an improvement this place has made with the service issues since the last time I was here over a year ago and previous visits before that.  Dinner hour was pretty busy but I didnt get handed a beeper and wait like always. This time I was able to walk up and hostess seated us right away.    Like I said the place was pretty slammed, but there was never a lag in wait time, and servers never doubted themselves, something that I had a problem with on previous visits. This time our server and the runners did a great job with taking our orders, getting our drinks, food and desserts to our table in a timely manner. We were always checked on, our drinks filled. Staff was attentive, everyone was friendly. No one seemed stressed out.   Only minor issue I had was when it got dark outside, the ambient lighting in the restaurant was too low.  We were cracking up because I was not the only table using their cell phone light to read the menu.  The SkinnyLicious menu was new to me and I'm lovin it!  A lot of the items are low carb or low cal most under 500 calories. I would so order their Kale Salad and the Flatbread with Pear, Blue Cheese and Arugula again. Flavors tasted really fresh and it is noted on the menu they hand make these items to order.  Hard to imagine that healthier choices can taste so good and be low enough that I can have a slice of the delish Kahlua Cocoa cheesecake (better than the Tiramisu!)  and not feel to guilty having it since Im still under my calorie intake for the day. Sweet I can have my cheesecake and eat it too!   On the other hand the burrito and the chicken dish that were also ordered in our party didn't live up to the prices they charge for this (13.95 and 16.95) ..it looked and tasted blah.   With a very pleasant dining experience I had tonight, I wont be hesitant now coming here for lunch or dinner. Stars for improved service, healthier choices on menu and star rating for the killer dessert!",

We had the lunch entrees which were huge. Enough for leftovers. Most commercial chain restaurants do not offer their lunch menus on the weekends .Cheesecake Factory you still got it.",

    "text": "We had dinner at Settebello recently and nothing on their dessert menu interested us. So we decided to walk over to Cheesecake factor to share some cheesecake.  It was a Saturday night and the place was jammin. Although, it seemed as if maybe they were short staffed, because at least 1/2 the restaurant was empty, but we had to wait to be seated (along with 3 or 4 other parties in front of us).  Once we were seated, it took between 10-15 minutes for our server to approach the table. This wasn't a big deal, because we had already eaten and it gave us time to decide on what slices to order. But if I were hungry, I would have become hangry real quick.  We decided to order 3 slices (all cheesecake): Banana cream, key lime and Kahlua Cocoa.  Our server returned a short while later and let us know that they were out of the banana cream and key lime, which were the 2 we really were excited to try.  We were pretty disappointed and I wish he would've known this when we ordered originally.  We then decided on the mango key lime and lemon meringue instead.  Now, it has been quite a long time (at least a few years) since I have been to Cheesecake Factory. They have a very large menu, and not many places can pull that off. However, the service was painstakingly slow.  We shouldn't be there more than an hour when we just ordered coffee/water and dessert. Although our service was very nice, I just didn't expect to be there as long as we were.  It probably took 20-30 minutes just to get our order.  I mean, come on! For 3 slices of cheesecake, which is obviously pre-made? A bit ridiculous.  Everything was really tasty, even if it was basically not what we originally wanted. We each had a different favorite - I actually quite liked the lemon meringue, which is not what I thought my favorite would be. The Kahlua Cocoa was really rich, but good as well. The mango key lime was probably my least favorite - I thought the mango over powered the key lime, but it wasn't bad by any means.  The prices were reasonable. Our check was $28 for the slices and drinks (1 coffee). Overall, I remembered why I hadn't been in so long, since there are SO many other options in the area. But I would definitely go back!",

My party arrived before I did so when I got there, I told the hostess Elizabeth that I am here to meet my party and before I could even finish saying the name she said \"Party for Keisha?\" I said no, informed her of my party's name again and proceeded to our table.  Anyone mildly aware understands that what took place that day is a very dangerous form of racism called microaggression.  In this case, Elizabeth's microaggression took the form of assuming that any black person that walks in MUST be with the black people that are already in the place. She shares the same mentality as the Alabama Victoria's Secret store owner that kicked out every black person in sight because of a private issue with one person. The mental effect is the same.  I informed the manager of the incident at the end of my meal and he was less than empathetic, never apologized, and never gave me the assurance that he acknowledged the gravity of Elizabeth's err.  My meal and server were great but the negative experience with Elizabeth and the manager overshadowed the entire experience warranting one star.",

Typically we love cheesecake factor however, this trip we had an issue and I was taken back as to how it was handled.   I ordered spaghetti and meatballs for my kids to all share, the first few meatballs were perfect, but the last one I cut into was significantly harder than the others when I did finally break thru, it was a dark brown inside, almost black in some areas.  As someone who cooks, I can not fathom how this kind of a thing happens other than it being an OLD meatball that somehow stayed in the pot well after its expiration date.  I could be wrong on this, but it was not explained to us and I cannot fathom how this could have gotten this way from being overcooked because the outside was not overcooked in any way.  -So, this makes me really disgusted on how this could happen.  The kicker for me is...there was not explaination, no visit from the manager, and no reduction of the bill either.  I was really taken back by it all.

We made it in just before closing time at midnight we were greeted with smiles and very courteous staff. Our server was Shawna. She was absolutely the sweetest person and treated us with excellent customer service. Our food was delicious and we were there to celebrate my sister in laws birthday, by the time we were finished with our dinner the restaurant was completely empty. The staff brought over a complimetery ice cream and sang happy birthday to her. I would highly recommended this restaurant to anyone  taking the time to read this review...my hat off to you the staff at Cheescake Factory for making our dining experience a memorable one for us. Thank you again from our family!",

I got my phone ready to record the singing celebration but it didn't happen. Instead the waiter brought the cheesecake over with the bill and left. This upset me because other tables got sang to. My girlfriend did not want to make a big scene of it but I know she was hurt. Thank you to the waiter for the bad service and making my girlfriend feel less special.",

They comped the pizza that did not have a bite out of it and I got an eye roll about the fish. I guess my major problem is crappy food for $100.

Wow, Henderson or the Green Valley Ranch area is pretty nice, lots of great stores and restaurants. Getting side-tracked momentarily, so we headed inside the restaurant and it is quite a nice place. Almost has that Las Vegas feel to it!  This Cheesecake factory tasted like any other Cheesecake factory - Good Food. Pretty much anything that you order from the menu is gonna be quite delicious. I usually go with my favorite - the Lemon Herb roasted Chicken - simply amazing and a must.  Although there desserts they specialize in Cheesecake (which is great by all means), but try there chocolate cake which isnt too shabby at all! If around the area again, definitely would stop by this place again!",

The waitress was pleasant but seemed rushed.  She filled our drink orders promptly which is a big plus.  It was very noisy but aesthetically pleasing.  We ordered the calamari as an appetizer and it was adequate.  We ordered the ribeye steak medium rare for our main course. It came out well done.  They offered to cook another one for us but we didn't think they the next steak would be prepared any better so we just ordered some pasta.  The waitress never apologized for this inconvenience. The pasta was pretty bland but edible.  Overall it was not worth the time or money that we spent there.  If your going to go to a chain restaurant stick to Outback, they at least know how to cook a steak.",

It was so bad we asked her to go home. She was falling asleep while taking our orders and her behavior was not the norm for CCF staff. Long story short the  orders were wrong and confused her. (Service for 6) She was replaced with another waiter and we were told she was sent home. So to make us happy we received 3 free cheesecakes and one meal free since it arrived after everyone was finish eating. I can say this was the worst service we have ever had but thank goodness the food remained at its highest quality as we would expect. I must say we did appreciate how fast the managers stepped in to make sure our dining ended on a good note. Becuz we love CCF I can't give it less then 4/5 stars but I will give our waitress a 2 star. Sorry. Hope u get better sleep nxt time u work.",

I don't believe people even know what \"good food\" is anymore.  And clearly the manager that was working 6/25/14 @ 1:00 pm, doesn't have a clue!!!  We ordered Fish Taco's & a Beef Sandwich similar to an philly cheese steak.  I kid you not....the taco's had ONE piece of fish in each taco the size of a nickel!  The rest of the taco was shredded cabbage!  The rice sat under a heatlamp so long that it was like biting into uncooked rice!  The sandwich that I ordered was beyond disgusting!  I ordered it without onion's.  When sandwich came it was loaded with onions....so I sent it back.  As well as the pathetic excuse of a fish taco!  Finally the incompetent waitress brought back the sandwich....and it literally had a cold piece of cheese in the roll....with cold raw fatty beef on 2/3's of the roll....and the other 1/3 of the sandwich was bare with nothing in it!!!!!  I couldn't believe they would serve this!  I called the manager over and he said \"Well that's how much meat we use and usually the onions bulk the sandwich up.\"  I wanted to backhand this fool!  You serve me cold, raw, fatty beef on 2/3's of a sub roll with cold non-melted cheese and think that's acceptable????  He said well I can get you something else.  At this point I said no thanks....you can keep it....we're leaving!  He said \"what about your taco's we're re-making?\"  I said ....Keep those too!!!!  He says...\"the waitress feels really bad....she really does.\"  The truth is....I could care less how the incompetent waitress feels!!!!!  I'm the one that feels bad here bud!  I just waited 45 minutes for food that I wouldn't give to my dog!!!!  Wow....this manager is in the wrong business!  And that waitress wasn't any better!  This place has NO STANDARDS for their food!  So do yourself a huge favor and go elsewhere!  I ended up going across the street to Capriottis and ordered a philly cheesesteak and it was great compared to the sandwich The Cheesecake Factory attempted to serve me for $13.95!!!!!  What a joke!

I didn't say anything. I know the server noticed me trying to recuse my potatoes from drowning. So she said she was leaving and Jennifer would be taking over. Well I don't think Jennifer was even there yet. 10-15 minutes go by meanwhile Christine is still taking care of the table next to us. Finally Jennifer! She was only there to put in our cheesecakes to go and grab the check. I wish she had been our server the whole time. Night and day difference.",

So dry and tough thought I was heading for a case of TMJ when my jaw started to pop out. Everything horribly overcooked. They even had the nerve to charge for the drinks and her Caesar with the entire dinner wrecked. NEVER going back.

I would definitely return and feel safe recommending to other yelpers  :)",
