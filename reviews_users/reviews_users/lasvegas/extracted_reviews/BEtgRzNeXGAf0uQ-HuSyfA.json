Side note: I always end up choosing shoyu ramen wherever I go because it's my favorite type of broth, and I'm never disappointed when I visit Ohjah. I had the best service when I dined in recently. My family and I had this male server and he was so nice and helpful - I wish I got his name because he deserves the recognition on yelp! He even gave us garlic edamame on the house. I love their garlic edamame and how it has this smoky flavor. Our waiter always checked on us and always made sure our drinks were refilled. We were a party of 6 and all our food came out in less than 15 minutes! Glad my family ended up liking this place.",

We ordered the Tan Tan Men, oxtail ramen, takoyaki, and squid skewers. Honestly, no complaints on any of the dishes because the flavor was excellent. Clean tasting without feeling too oily or fatty.   Our service was superb. Our waters never reached the bottom, and we were consistently asked if we needed anything, while not feeling interrupted.   Ultimately, this first time experience has compelled me to write a review. We will be back again soon!",

We ordered an oxtail ramen and got a few appetizers. Got the takoyaki, edamame, and takowasabi.  I wasn't feeling up for ramen. Ramen usually kills me and gives me heartburn because of all that heavy feeling it leaves behind. I decided to share with my other half and the broth is great!   The broth was not salty and it had enough flavor in it, didn't give me heartburn either haha. It was delicious! It had about two pieces of oxtail in it. I want to come back again to try the other ramen.   The takoyaki was VERY good! The taste was very traditional and had that crispy outside. Takowasabi was normal, I mean how hard is it to go wrong with this? The portion was a bit larger than I expected though but not a bad thing! At last, I don't want to review the edamame because I think it all tastes the same but I was just craving it so decided to order it.",

We at first tried the one in Henderson but the line was way too long and very busy. We then adventured to the southwest side of town and found this one busy but welcoming. Ohjah is not a huge place but big enough with about 8 tables and good vibe. We were seated and given drinks and menus right away. We ordered the Yaki Gyoza, best way to describe it is a dumpling. Had good flavor with a spicy dipping sauce. We also ordered the shrimp skewers, which resemble little lolly pops. These were quite crispy and had a spicy mayo drizzle. For the main meal I ordered the beef ramen and Josie ordered the chicken Ramen. Both are priced well and offer a full bowl of flavor. Comes with a hard boiled egg in the middle, scallions, beansprouts, seaweed and root fungus. Neither were spicy and the broth was exceptional. Not overly impressed with the noodles but we may have had a different expectation due to past experiences at other noodle spots. The staff was very attentive and had refills before being asked.  Thank you for eating at Ohjah Noodle house. We would for sure go here again and possibly try the one in Henderson. Stop in and give it a try I am sure you will be satisfied with your decision.",

I got the tonkotsu ramen and my boyfriend got the spicy shoyu! We've been to COUNTLESS ramen bars all over vegas and California and this is really good ramen! We will definitely be back :)",

    "text": "I have no complaints about this place. Honestly one of the best noodle restaurants in SW area. When Kobo opened up next door, it was too hyped up. Given, the noodles are made fresh everyday but they don't offer any other special appetizers. The portion is small and the chashu is mostly just fat.   I'm so happy Ohjah opened up a noodle house concept. Their oxtail is surprisingly tender and full of flavor and the noodles are cooked to perfection. The soup is delicious- never too salty or oily like other ramen/noodle spots.   As for their appetizers, they offer a wide variety of great classic options such as Tako Wasabi, Squid Skewers (GET THE SKEWERS IT'S THE BEST!!!!) Takoyaki and fried oysters! The squid skewers are best I've had!!   The service is always impeccable- Genie and Leo are really kind and were really attentive, contributing to our amazing experience here. Leo is so passionate about the food here he'll tell you all about how everything is made.   Thank you Ohjah and Mr. Wong for bringing such an awesome restaurant to this side of town!!!",

    "text": "Another Ramen joint in Vegas! The perfect time of the year to get nice hot bowl of noodles. Talk about match made in heaven plus always enjoy checking out new restaurants around the valley. Guess Ohjah has a bunch of restaurants each one specializing in one style or food. I never been to any of the other ones. I was excited about checking out one of the newest ones. Ramen is one of my favorite foods.   The menu is not much different then other Ramen places around town you pick your style broth and then spicy level. One item that stood out for me. Thankful yelp community checked out the pics noticed oxtail ramen. I was one of there house special ramen. The spicy level went mild since first time and had no idea level of hot. The medium or mild was nice subtle kick nothing major. The oxtail had mixed feelings. One piece with the bone that had hardly any meat and it was super tough. Then you had couple other pieces fall off the bone just the meat and was Sooo good. It was nice moist, juicy, and could have bowl of just oxtail. The broth has great depth and really good. The noodles was also delicious. The toppings you can add more but just went with whatever came with the dish. It always tradition for me go ramen style get some gyoza. It was very tasty. Overall solid Ramen spot. It definitely up in my top five but couple of the more stable Ramen spots better. The location literally almost in my backyard less then ten minutes away. I have no problem coming back for more then deal with long line of the more busy spots.  One thing need mention that Ohjah stands out, The size of the restaurant. We all associate Ramen spots or least for me. Not very big. Ohjah is literally twice the size then any other ramen spot around town. I only came for lunch so not sure the dinner crowd. I would find it hard see long waiting list like some of the smaller ramen spots around town. The service is nothing but five stars!!! My server was friendly, explain the menu being my first time, and always had smile on his face. Positive vibes. The decor inside feels more like restaurant restaurant  with the size lots of booths, tables, and not forget they do have ramen bar area that can watch the magic happen while you slurp down some noodles. I will be back....",

    "text": "Okay okay... first things first... OX TAIL RAMEN. Once I saw it on the menu, I HAD TO GET IT. But instead, I decided on the Ohjah House Ramen---beef, chasu, AND ox tail. MEAT LOVERS HEAVEN. *drooooolz*  A problem with ox tail in most restaurants is the level of tenderness. Most times I've had ox tail at a sub par pho restaurant, the ox tail was difficult to eat, but Ohjah does it RIGHT. Literally fall off the bone, juicy and succulent. The broth is something you must have in this cold ass Vegas winter; definitely hits the spot! Another thing I enjoyed is the piece of bok choy that is included in the ramen, it was a perfect, refreshing, addition to the meal.   One thing that did irk me a bit is the noodle to broth ratio. The amount of noodles and toppings were PERFECT, it was a lot more than what other ramen spots serve, but the bowl could stand a little more broth  \\_()_/    BEST THING, (better than Jinya): SUPER SPACIOUS. A lot more seating to accommodate bigger parties, and a lot more lighting---it does your Yelp pictures justice.   I seriously can't wait to sink my teeth in some ox tail ramen again!!!",

The place had several tables opens and the staff quickly and kindly greeted us before showing us to a booth. We could see the kitchen and it was busy with chefs handling several incoming orders.   Our waitress was super friendly, helpful and accommodating to our various dietary needs. She even called one of the chefs over to personally explain a few menu items and ingredients to ensure there would be no issues.   The food was delivered quickly and hot! My ramen (Shoyu substitute chicken) was incredibly flavorful and well balanced. Most importantly, the noodles were cooked PERFECTLY.   We also had chicken Katsu. It was well prepared and delicious.   Takoyaki was nice, though the octopus was barely there.  Chicken egg rolls were full of meat and piping hot.   Total bill was ~$10/person and I would highly recommend this for lunch/dinner, in a hurry or wanting to take your time, date night!!, family (w kids 8+)",

My broth was so bland, I added the chili spices, chili oil and soy sauce to try and give it some flavor, it helped subtly. My husband ordered the Tan Tan Med and was told it would be spicy.

Ohjah lacks flavor and often serves ramen warm and not hot. I've also ordered a regular noodle dish which was drenched in sauce and was basically a soul. I appreciate their attempts to load the bowls of ramen to look good for pictures but a lot of what their noodle soup dishes have don't mix well for flavor.",

Had House Ramen, pork good, beef okay, but oxtail disappointment. They need to cook it longer so falls off the bone.  They have spicy option, but it's not really spicy. Add chili oil! The mushrooms were outstanding, would add more next time.  Chicken egg rolls were solid. One thing we didn't like - the takoyaki (fried octopus, breaded and served in medium size balls). Underfried so inside breading was mushy. We told them and they apologized and were quick to respond. Again, they treat you well!  We'll be back.",

The ramen (we ordered Ohjah ramen with pork broth) was superb.  The broth was rich without being too salty, and the assortment and portion of meats and toppings made it a great value in my opinion.  I have never had oxtail in my ramen before, and it was perfect - tender, melt-in-the-mouth good.  We also ordered a number of small plates, and each one tasted as good as it was artfully presented.  Of note, the garlic edamame wasn't your typical edamame tossed with some fried garlic.  The sauce was just to die for!    The staff was super attentive and kind even though we brought kids to the restaurant against our better judgment.  Our picky kids loved it and were entertained by the staff who were so much fun (there was dancing and ice cream involved).    I am tired of ramen places with super tiny seating areas where you can't even try to bring kids, not to mention the long waits.  The food here is every bit as good or better as those other crazy crowded ramen bars, and the service absolutely can't be beat.  WIN.  My family will be frequenting this joint exclusively from now on.",

    "text": "My family and I came to Ohjah Noodle House for dinner last night. To be honest, I'm not a huge ramen fan so I guess you can disregard my review now.  My family shared an order of takoyaki and an order of gyoza. As for my main course, I decided to go with the Tan Tan Men. They offered different levels of spiciness for it: mild, medium, and extra spicy. I decided to go with the extra spicy because I love spicy stuff.   The gyoza was okay. A little on the salty side. In fact, you don't even need to dip it into the soy sauce at all. Just eat it by itself. Pretty average. Nothing special. It is what you would expect it to be.  The takoyaki wasn't that great. There was nothing special about it and I've had better. It didn't come hot, which was disappointing. I usually love it when my takoyaki is served steaming hot ... because that's how its served. At Ohjah, though, it was just warm and a little on the harder side and not the soft texture like I'm used.   Then came the Tan Tan Men. It came with a nice scoop of chili paste on top, similar to sambal. The server was really nice though; he said if it wasn't spicy enough then he'll bring me more chili paste or I could use chili powder. Well, I can say that their extra spicy wasn't really spicy. I didn't want to bother with the extra chili paste because if it really was sambal, it's not spicy.   There were a lot of reviews stating that their extra spicy was supposed to be no joke? Maybe I came on an off day or something? Because I really didn't taste anything spicy.  As for the soup flavor, it didn't really capture me. Everything tasted pretty boring. The noodles themselves were good though .. they were cooked al dente, which is perfect!  According to my family, the oxtail is very good -- the meat is tender and has really good flavor.   The service is pretty good though. Our server would check up on us from time to time and refilled our waters promptly.  Overall, I probably won't return. There wasn't anything that I loved :( But that's fine. I'll just stick to their hibachi locations haha.",

Items ordered that I tried:  Seaweed salad Takoyaki Tako wasabi Karaage Sliced dried beef Gyoza dumplings Tonkotsu ramen with extra egg  Two things from the appetizer list that stood out for me were the seaweed salad and the tako wasabi.  Although seaweed is pretty much the same from one Japanese restaurant to another, this presentation and dressing were first rate.  Teh tako wasabi was also very good.  I enjoyed the takoyaki but I only have one other place to compare this with and it stood the comparison well.  The ramen was a normal sized portion.  The noodles for the tonkotsu are thin and are house made.  The broth was rich and the ramen is good.  Service was excellent with items brought out in separate stops rather than many things at once.    It's good to have a ramen house of this quality without going to somewhere on Spring Mountain Road.  It's a quick trip on the freeway for me to get here.",

Came here for lunch and I ordered their special beef ramen and my friend ordered the oxtail ramen.  I ordered mine medium spicy and she ordered it hot.  Spice comes in the form of a chili oil paste thats not premixed, just on top of the soup.  So you can mix a little first to see how you like it.  I thought medium was a little too hot so I scooped out some of the chili oil.  The noodles were good and I really enjoyed their broth but I did not like the flavor or the texture of their meat.  It was thin slices of tendenous beef.  It wasn't chewy or tough but I thought it didn't go well with the broth.  Also I love the texture of soft pork belly chashu much more.  My friend's oxtail was good but again it was a little weird eating it with ramen.  It didn't seem to go together very well.  But the oxtail was cooked well and pretty tender.  I would come back again but next time I'm definitely sticking to their traditional ramen with chashu meat.  I enjoyed their broth and noodles and their ramen comes with half of a soft boiled egg which is always a bonus.",

    "text": "Probably my new favorite ramen place!   First of all the place is big!! Lots of booths and tables - unlike other ramen places where they have two tables and a few seats at the counter. No one will be bumping into each other!  Service was good. Quickly seated, offered water immediately, and orders taken as soon as we were ready.   The house ramen with chasu, beef and oxtail! I love oxtail and when oxtail and ramen are combined... I am one happy girl!! The portion was perfect! Not too much noodles, not too much broth! Broth was perfect, not too salty or creamy, the meats were tender and flavorful! Really good ramen!!   They ask if you want broth re-fill... never been asked that before!! We actually stumbled into this place because other places we wanted to try had a long wait and so glad we did!   Will definitely be coming back!!",

I had ordered the gyoza and a regular tonkotsu. The gyoza was steamed and the meat inside was flavorful, though it did not taste that fresh. For the tonkotsu, it was average. The broth seemed watered down and not as creamy as other tonkotsus that I have had. The chashu pork was not that flavorful and was a bit too fatty for my liking. But, the egg was cooked well where the yolk was very creamy and not hard boiled. Overall, I did not think that their ramen was memorable.",

Server is nice enough to offer extra soup when she realizes my ramen has no more soup. As long as they keep their consistency, I am sure they will be as successful as other ramen places.",

I also got the tako wasabi which was delicious, fresh, and spicy!   I was so full that I couldn't finish my food and it was hilarious that the server thought I hated my food because I couldn't finish it all! I will definitely be back.

Very rich, not greasy and most of all not overly salty.  A lot of ramen places mask the quality of the broth with salt...so that when you finish the noodles and all the topping you actually enjoy having the broth on its own.  The oxtail ramen is my favorite,  the oxtail is delicious bc they cook it so that the meat is super tender and easy to eat, even my 82 year old father with loose dentures can chew it  the egg is delicious and prepared correctly...well seasoned where the yolk is  soft boiled with a custard texture.  The chasu is delish and melts in your mouth.  All in all I really like this place and will come frequently, mostly bc I literally live next door to it 5 minutes away.",

I wanted to order every single appetizer they had, but I only ended up getting takoyaki which was amazing. I asked for a side of chili sauce because I love adding a bit of heat to my dishes. I got the Shoyu ramen without the meat & egg, and my boyfriend got the Tan Tan Men. The broth for my ramen was refreshing while my boyfriends was spicy. Also, the noodles were thin which made everything 10x better since I'm a fan of thin noodles. The service was amazing and the interior was clean and had an urban feel to it. I know I'll be going here again.",

Mannnn oh man, let me say that by far the competition is nowhere close.  First off, the noodles are way better in comparison to ramen kobo and service was exceptional fast. Upon entering, I was seated without a hassle. The people there were nothing but nice and gave you suggestions whenever you asked. Since I had already browsed help for some ideas on what to order, I hate my order taken quickly. I got the tonkatsu ramen with seaweed and black truffle oil. Oh my gosh, it was bomb. The flavor was amazing and the noodles were made to perfection.  Check this place out if you're feeling some ramen! It's really good!",

So... I'm grateful that Ohjah decided to branch out from Teppanyaki to Noodles. I'm going to keep this one really brief. There is a wide variety of good food here from appetizers to beer. I recommend adding some pepper oil to your meal unless you are really really against spice. I needed a few spoonfuls to make my ramen taste just right and I'm not a huge spice nut. They also provide you with garlic cloves upon request which added an extra depth of flavor for me. No extra charge. Everything we had was very delicious and pretty much on par with any other ramen joint you'll find around town. If you are there for the first time, the Ohjah House Special is a good choice. Very good. While the food is good, there is nothing completely mind-blowing. And that's ok. Because to me, the real advantage that this place is that it can accommodate a lot more people than your average ramen joint in Las Vegas. There is plenty of table seating as well as counter seating and parking doesn't seem to be an issue here. That is a huge plus because I'm so over waiting for 45 minutes just to have a bowl of ramen. For this reason alone, I will be frequenting this joint much more.  This place just opened recently so the staff seems like they are being over-cautious but they are friendly and warm. I'm actually looking forward to going down the list of food items like I usually do at places I like.",

    "text": "While in Vegas we were craving some epic ramen. After searching and coming to the conclusion that all the good places were off the strip, we ended up taking a  quick 15 minute drive to this spot. Luckily, the place wasn't packed and we were immediately seated. Everything looked good on the menu so it was quite difficult to decide what to get, so we ended up getting a ton of stuff. We ended up getting everything from the gyoza to the chicken karage and even fried rice. Of course we got ramen too, but my favorite part of the meal was the fried rice. Imagine the fried rice from Bennihanas, but a million times better, bigger and cheaper. Everything else was pretty tasty too, but man oh man, I would totally make the trip just for that fried rice alone. Next time I'm planning on ordering a huge plate all to myself! Overall, if you're in the area and craving some yummy Japanese cuisine then definitely check this spot out.",

You have to get it with garlic oil - the flavor is tremendous and I also get it spicy but be prepared it was really spicy. I ended up having to scoop some of the chilis out. It's a nice comfort food option.",

The wife and I frequent Ohjah Noodle house off Trop and Hualipai for their Teppanyaki, and are super glad they opened up a Ramen spot off Durango.   Ohjah's TonKotsu broth is immensely flavorful and on point! (I'll be it a lil spicy than you might be used to) They have an amenity of solid, fresh, and well executed menu items. And I must say, between the decor and consistency of food, I was most impressed by their throughly attentive and hospitable service. Kudos Leo, Fegi and other staff-mates, you guys really make Ohjah what it is and well worth returning to time after time.",

I had a bad experience and refused to give it a second shot. But after multiple debates with myself, I gave in.  I have been on this kick of eating vegetarian thanks to the recent documentary I watched so I had to go with the veggie ramen. Broth was just right and not salty at all! It was fully packed with noodles and veggies of all kind. Even with a medium spice level, it wasn't enough for me but they packed some extra on the side to help kick it up for the next level.  I ordered ahead which only took about 15 minutes. The staff was absolutely amazing and so warm & welcoming. I will be sure to come back and will dine in to fully experience the atmosphere of this cozy neighborhood spot.",

I was a bit hesitant because hey when I fly back home I can have ramen and 2 I'm not a big fan of Ramen in general, I rather have udon. Since he isn't coming back to Hawaii to visit for a while, I agreed to go.  We came here on a weekday and it was filled with a few people. I ordered the tan tan mien and got spicy. The server told me if it's not spicy he would bring me more spicy sauce. I was busy taking pictures and he came back to check on me. After I added the extra spicy sauce I liked it! My friend got the ohjiah house special ramen. He enjoyed his.   We shared the takoyaki and fried oysters. They were pretty good.   Let me say the service is very good.

Their oxtail ramen pretty much sets them apart from other places.   My boyfriend and I both got the Ohjah Noodle house. It was pretty good with the oxtail, but the broth wasn't anything too special. Usually it's the broth that makes me want more, but it was pretty average. I wavered between 3 or 4 stars. It would have been 4 if I loved the broth. They do add a whole chasu egg which was a plus. Some places give you half an egg and others don't add the egg at all!   Service was polite. Our waiters gets his own star because of how nice he was. He was attentive but not so attentive that he kind of disrupted the meal he kept the water flowing and sometimes that's all a customer needs!",

When we arrived, we were immediately greeted and seated by a very friendly and attentive server. He bowed to us repeatedly. Great service here. The menu is diverse and you are encouraged to customize your bowl with your choice of broth, noodles, and choice of protien or veggies along with eggs. The decor and ambiance was very nice. Best part of the experience, other than the food, was the service.   There are 5 locations including one in Pahrump in case your packing a huge appetite after leaving the Chicken Ranch!

I was struggling a bit with the menu because I know I love Oxtail but I saw that it came with \"Wood Fungus\" . I was a bit put off and scared so I'm glad the waitress explained that it is like mushrooms . I can definitely do mushrooms so after that I felt more relaxed . Personally I think they should call it a mushroom,truffle something along those lines ....it just sounds more appetizing.   The broth was perfect on such a gloomy day. There was plenty of fresh green onions, and spinach in the soup as well. The Ox tail was tender and filling along with the noodles. I would order this again.   Ohjah is no stranger to me because I do love eating in their teppanyaki restaurants. It was nice to see them branch out and try something new . The noodle house feels very relaxing to me with all of the woodlike decor. It's a great place to meet up with a friend and catch up over a bowl of soup.",

Ohjah provides both thin and thick noodles, and the tonkatsu ramen comes in thin. If I had known, I would have ordered thick noodles.   Although the ox tail is Ohjah's house special, I didn't find anything special about it. I also wasn't a fan of the spinach due to conflicting texture with the ramen.   The waiters were friendly and attentive, always checking in.",

Got seated immediately for a Thursday night.  Ordered the Oxtail ramen and you can pick your own spice level and I went with the extra spicy....it had a nice kick, but bearable. Only complaint would be wanting more oxtail, but definitely would be back to try other things. For what you get and the cost overall, this place is worth it. Broth isn't too greasy and tons of topping options.   Edamame is served on the house & they'll even give you free dessert with a Yelp review !",

And let me tell you about this egg, it was off the hizz-op! Can't end this post without mentioning Ohjah Noodle House's AMAZING service, particularly Holly Wong. She was radiating and helpful to me, insistently asking if I wanted more noodles, to which I said \"yis pls.\" Best waitress I've ever had. Ohjah Noodle House: 10/10 would recommend again.",

Then we ordered Tonkatsu Ramen ( where ever we go this is a must in our order) Chicken Katsu for my daughter and then we wanted to try one of there house special TanTan Men Ramen. Everything we order came so fast and was so so good! The servers are so accomodating checking on us everytime, they even offered extra soup for our ramen.

Tonkatsu ramen came with pork, egg, scallions, bean sprouts, and black mushrooms. The tonkatsu broth was really rich and flavorful and comes with thin noodles, which I prefer over the thicker one. And the charshu slices were super tender. So good. Ask the server for fresh garlic!!! I think it makes a huge difference in the flavor of the broth. The service is on point and everyone is so helpful.",

The restaurant is quite spacious in comparison to other Noodle houses so getting a table wasn't difficult. The staff is very courteous and friendly.   I ended up ordering the Ohjah House Ramen ($11.95) with black garlic oil (Additional $1.00), which came with the works (Pork, beef, and oxtail and all the added fixens). The ramen was delicious! The meat was cooked well and tasted perfect. They give you a little side dish to put leftover bones from the oxtail, as well, so they aren't left in the ramen. After finishing, I felt full without feeling like I ate too much. They gave us a little candy with the check and we left! I will definitely come back!",

Ordered the oxtail ramen with miso base for soup and it was unbelievably good. Oxtail was tender and flavorful. Great ramen place but too far out from my home. I just happened to be in the area.

I thought it might be like a scrawny piece but nah it was pretty fat.  Our servers were sweet to us too. I think their names were Holly and Diana. We were indecisive and they were accomodating; even making suggestions on what they liked and not just pointing out the expensive items.  Definitely will come back!",

All were too salty or wait times were exceedingly brutal. We came to our senses when we figured one does not go to Vegas for ramen. Duh!  Monkey do:  TONKOTSU RAMEN w/thick noodle- where some say underwhelming, Monkey thankful it not so salty.   At $9, it's a decent bowl of ramen, though it'd be perfect if it came with a third slice of chashu, corn, more bean sprouts and another seaweed. $5 more would be absurd.   Monkey returned for:  OHJAH HOUSE RAMEN-  2 each of oxtail, beef, chashu, egg, seaweed  $11.50. Okay happy now.   Clean, spacious and friendly, Monkey will definitely return.  Hot or cold days and no wait?  Count on It.",

We waited for awhile since there were a lot of people that was nearby as well for the Asian Night Market. This was understandable. However, they made us write our name on the clipboard yet they didn't even look at it. Every time they would just ask for whoever is standing closest to the front to see if they were next. I understand they were busy, but thats what the clipboard is for! When we were finally seated and got our food, I was quite disappointed by it. I got the tan tan noodle, karaage, and my boyfriend got the tonkatsu ramen. The soup does not have rich flavor, especially the tonkatsu ramen. It was quite bland. Compare to many other ramen place, this place is probably my least favorite. Service was decent considering how busy they were, which is why I gave it a 2. In my opinion, there are better ramen out there.",

The staff is very friendly and very helpful.  Always greeted with a smile when you walk in.  The different types of ramen come with either a chicken broth or a pork broth.  You can always request the broth you prefer and they will make your ramen with that broth at no extra cost.  I've had the tan tan, ohjah special, but my usual is the miso ramen.  Depending on how hungry I am, I may get extra noodles.  The nice thing is... if you need more broth, just ask and they will bring out a small bowl for you.  Also, if you ordered the pork broth and wanted to taste the chicken broth, they will gladly bring out a small bowl for you to taste.    Besides the ramen, I have had the gyoza, takoyaki, house fried rice, garlic edamame, chicken wings, and chicken egg rolls.  Of all the appetizers, I'd have to say the fried rice and garlic edamame were my favorites.  I just can't get enough of their spicy chili sauce they make in-house.  So good and so spicy!!!",

Japanese ramen is salty and fatty and that's what I love. This is none of those things. I realize fat is required for the broth to stick to the noodles. Just use the spoon. It works better.   The broth is clean and milky. Cooking oxtail can render a ton of grease, but they took the time to skim it, leaving just the milky flavor to speak for itself. It's also not salty, just right. For the first time in a while, I left a ramen shop not feeling parched.   The chashu had a nice roasted crust and pretty tender, but it knew it wasn't the star. It graciously let the oxtail be the main attraction. It was like Korean oxtail soup I get at my grandmother's.   Everything was in balance, if anything, there was more meat than noodles. No complaints there. The noodles were al dente and stayed that way the whole time with good chew.   I can't remember the last time I left a ramen shop feeling like I didn't pay with a few days of longevity.",

Our waitress was quick and friendly. She took our order when we were ready and the food came out quickly after.  My boyfriend ordered the Tan Tan Men Ramen, extra spicy and added corn, menma, and chashu. This was really, really good! The broth was so flavorful and the thick noodles were made perfectly. It wasn't exactly \"extra spicy\" though.  I ordered the Tonkotsu with corn and menma. Mmmmm, it was so delicious. The broth was amazing and full of so much flavor. Not too salty, not too thick. Temperature was perfect. Chashu was tender. I'm drooling just thinking about it. But, my one complaint is they don't have on their menu what kind of noodles come with the different broths/flavors. And, sadly, mine came with the thin noodles :( I just am obsessed with the thick noodles but didn't want to switch it or anything like that. So the thin noodles were ok but I would have preferred the thick!   If I lived in this area, this would be my go-to Ramen spot!! But I live nearly a half hour away :( it was definitely worth the drive to try it out, though and I'll probably make the drive again to try the beef and oxtail ramens!!",

Already this was a huge plus, she was so thoughtful. We started with the Gyoza and garlic edamame and loved both. We initially shared the Tan Tan ramen number 2 and liked it so much that we got another order. The service was great and so was the food. Will become a loyal customer.",

    "text": "Yes, they finally have a Yelp page! Saw a month + ago that Ohjah is opening up a Noodle a.k.a Ramen place near my house and had been dying to try it out. I have been to Ohjah's two other locations for their hibachi, which I am a big fan of but Japanese ramen is a pretty new concept to this brand. Ever since the Noodle House's opening last week, I have already been there twice, trying different ramen and side dishes each time. I have to say that when it comes to ramen, broth is one of the most important thing to me, next being the noodle. The broth is flavorful and the noodle the right texture. It is definitely one of the better ramen-offering place in the Southwest part of Las Vegas. The interior design is modern and trendy; the place is also located at a convenient location where new shops and restaurants are popping up. Also wanted to mention that their waiter and waitresses are super nice and polite that I double-tipped them. I hope their excellent customer service never change!  I have tried their Tonkotsu Ramen, Shoyo Ramen, Ohjah House Ramen, Seafood Ramen, Takoyaki, and Tako Wasabi so far --- all are great! I'm definitely looking forward to going back and try more different dishes.",

We asked for the shrimp tempura roll because we had a coupon for a free one (which they took the coupon). We received an order of shrimp tempura and was charged for it and was not informed until after the bill, and which they did not change it for us. The chicken karaage is a really small order, ours came with 4 pieces and the picture on the menu shows at least 8 pieces. We asked to get the tonkotsu ramen and to take out everything except the meat and egg(noodles and soup included) and our server was confused and rude towards us because he could not figure out the ordering system on the ipad. We asked to add ground pork to our soup and was explained to us (in frustration) that the soup does not come with it. We simply said, we would like to add it because it's on the toppings options. Also, this place is small enough where we can see the bar where they cook. We overheard our server say, \"They wanted to remove everything, remove remove remove *grunts*\" Food was not all that good either because of the small amount we had of it.  Was not pleased with our experience here.",

I ordered black garlic oil (normally a big fan) and it just tasted like burnt sludge- disgusting. It feels like no salt or pork flavor was imparted to the tonkotsu at all. I'm not exaggerating when say I've had more flavorful Campbell's soup broth before. The chashu was tough, and small. The egg was not seasoned (usually it should be marinated in soy sauce, sake and mirin) and was overdone (it should be soft boiled but mine was almost completely hard boiled). The spinach overpowered everything else in the bowl, and it feels like they were trying to pad out the bowl with it. Overall, it wasn't even mediocre ramen, it was bad ramen. I could've made better ramen myself at home. The only thing that was good was the takoyaki- it was decently good at a fair price.  If you want American fusion ramen with rich flavors, go to Jinya. If you want authentic ramen, go to Monta or Ramen Sora. If you want flavorless garbage, go here.  Update: I vomited shortly after posting this. Not happy at all- will not be ordering again, or consider going at all.",

The broth is so flavorful, noodles fresh, and the meat/seafood is always yummy. You can't go wrong with any choice, but I suggest trying the fried oyster appetizer with the #8 shrimp ramen meal.

Ohjah is actually very spacious and I've never had to wait to be seated. They also have a variety of appetizers and dishes other than ramen.   My go-to lately has been the Ohjah Ramen with chicken broth. If you love lots of meat I highly recommend this one. You get a nice big piece of oxtail, two chashu pork slices and beef slices. Also comes with two pieces of nori and one marinated soy sauce egg. The broth is so flavorful and the ramen noodles are cooked perfectly. There's plenty of meat and noodles that I can never finish it in one sitting.   Service is pretty good too, the workers are friendly and attentive. My friend left his debit card and didn't realize it til later in the day and decided he would pick it up the next day. When he called the worker was really nice about it and told him he can come before opening hours and they would have it for him in morning.   Definitely recommend this place if you want some quality ramen.",

We also started with some takoyaki of course.   The decor, service, and over ambiance was really great and modern. The service was awesome, even though we came an hour before closing.   Again, I really wanted to love this place. The tan tan men ramen was a ground pork ramen with all the usual fixings. I think the actual ramen noodles were  good quality, but the broth wasn't as sufficing. The oxtail broth was super plain that he had to add a ton of soy sauce and hot sauce to add flavor. At least the takoyaki was good.   Sorry, but next time probably gonna drive the extra few miles to our favorite ramen spots on spring mountain.",

    "text": "Oil ramen. Yum. I think not.  My first sip of the Tan Tan ramen broth was essentially oil and a little bit of spice, and that sums up the dish. I tried to spoon off the oil, but my noodles were already coated at that point. There was no saving that dish.  Ohjah's broth was better, still slightly on the oiler side but bareable. I've had hearter broths at other places though. Char was not as melt in your mouth as I expected. Flavorwise was lacking too.  Gyoza was gyoza. Nothing special. Sizing is proportional to pricing (5 small pieces.)  Takoyaki was fantastic.. Perfectly crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. The amount of bonito flakes they used makes me happy.  Service was great. The servers were attentive and friendly. Good prices for good portion sizes.   There is a TON of competition around in terms of ramen, so with that said my hunt for good ramen continues.",

The service was pretty good and consistent.  When I asked the server about the takoyaki, she told me it was calamari. I asked her if it was the the fried and had crab? She responded, yes. So I ordered that and their beef noodle. My mother got the oxtail! When we got the takoyaki, it did come out fried but, definitely not what I expected. I took one bite and thought the calamari inside wasn't cooked all way. We ended up just eating one. Now, with the soup I ordered. The beef soup was average. I thought the beef was good but the temperature was not great. The soup wasn't very hot. My mother's oxtail noodle on the other hand was delicious. I think they might have forgotten mine and just let it sat there which could be the reason why it wasn't hot.   Overall it was alright. I think I just ordered wrong maybe, we will try again another time.",

There's also coupons in the mail sometimes for free appetizers, so that's also a bonus! (Will not say no to free takoyaki)  Food: Tan tan men, Tonkatsu Ramen, & Takoyaki  Tan tan men was not very spicy, but they gave us some spice on the side to add on. Flavor of both broths are very deep and satisfying. It's not overly salty like some ramen places can be. Noodles have a nice bite to them and toppings included with each ramen bowl are very generous. Usually you have to add things like egg for an extra dollar, but it's included here in most choices. You also can't go wrong with takoyaki, ever. It's well made and is not over sauced.   What is better than the food here? SERVICE.   We ordered extra noodles and the manager swung by, noticed my bowl was a little low on broth. He asked if we would like more broth for the noodles. I was a little concerned that he would charge, but he said free of charge! How could you eat your noodles without broth? It came out in a separate bowl, piping hot. Amazing. Our waters were also always filled and we never felt like we needed to wave down someone, they were on top of their game! (without being overbearing) They really want to make sure you enjoy your ramen here & that we did!",

I ordered the Tan Tan Men because it was spicy, and it was out within five minutes. It was in the largest bowl I think I've ever seen!

First off I noticed it was very clean and the music was very relaxing and cool so I was already feelin this place before we even ate. I got the beef pho and the meat was so tender and flavorful! The shrimp appetizer was fried to perfection and the service was amazing. I love their choices of seasonings and the beer was ice cold so what more could you ask for?

    "text": "Hubby and I popped in here on a sleepy Saturday morning, having just arrived in town for the weekend.  Although this didn't sound like a traditional Japanese ramen place, we thought we'd give it a try based on it's ratings.  It wasn't busy nor did it get busy during our time there (which would have been peak lunch time)  but I'm guessing it's because this is a little further out from the Strip.  As a result, we were quickly greeted and seated.    Nice interior (working a/c at this time of year is also a plus).    We ordered the takoyaki, the house fried rice, tan tan ramen and I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with an oxtail-add on.  Takoyaki was really good...but not exactly traditional in that it appeared to be...deep fried??  Interesting...so pass if you're a purist.  Fried rice was a good solid fried rice.  The chasu used was fattier (a plus in my book) rather than the lean cuts you usually see in this dish.  Great flavor, too.  Next came the noodles.  Hubby's tan tan men noodle broth was sweeter than I'm accustomed to.  He was ok with it.  He mentioned it wasn't as rich as he would like.  The noodles were cooked perfectly, however.  For my tonkotsu, I have to give a shout-out on the oxtail...very tender and generous serving.  The broth was good too, tasting of pigs feet and bones. The chasu was cooked very tender.  The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of were the noodles.  They used thin noodles which I approve of but the texture of these particular noodles were more like somen.  No bite.  Service was friendly and awesome.  Definitely worth checking out!",

It was by comparison much less interesting. Not entirely unenjoyable, but not incredible. So, for me Go!ku is a 5, Monta is a 4, and this is not quite as good, so it is a 3.

I really love the way they makes those ramen soups not too salty which most of other places do. They also make the broth of the real meat instead of using stock.

The takoyaki is so good too.  My only tip is don't order the mochi to go in Vegas unless you plan on eating it in the car",

We also got the egg roll and spring roll appetizers, which were amazing. Some of the best spring rolls we've ever had.   The service was exceptional. Drinks were constantly refilled and the staff were super friendly. I think this will be our go-to ramen place from now on!",

The decoration is beautiful and makes the place pop.   We liked that the menu was nice and simple to read. We ordered the Oxtail super with Charsu and for our little one e has the base Raman with beef broth. The probs were great for us but a bit large for the kids portion. (Hey but who doesn't love eating left overs) we also ordered the house green tea and water. The soup had tons of meat and really well balanced. And my husband left ready to go to sleep full and happy.   Great place and the service was exceptional I would definitely refer this place to anyone!",

    "text": "Mmm, it seems like they improved their recipe yet again. Yum!  Upgrade to 4.5 stars.  They have these new nicer bowls for the ramen.  The bowls are taller, which I think is nice because there is less splashing on my clothing (I am a messy eater LOL).  I think maybe the bowl kept the broth hotter for longer, too.    The ramen broth was even more delicious than before.  The spiciness is from shredded fresh peppers and less dependent on chili oil.  The chashu is like American BBQ style now, crispy on the edges - I really like it a lot!  This place never seems that full, which makes me sad.  Give them a try!  They are always very friendly and constantly refilling your drinks and checking on you.",

Luckily there was no wait time cuz there no customers. I don't know if it was just slow cuz it was a Sunday but we were excited to try the Ramen.   To our disappointment, we actually didn't enjoy the Ramen much. The broth had an off taste. Usually when a soup is served it should be served really hot with the steam rising above the bowl buts ours did not. It was luke warm. I ordered the beef ramen and added an extra egg and bamboo shoots. I tasted the bamboo shoots alone and it tasted rancid. My sister had the tan tan Ramen Bowl and said the ground pork tasted old and gamey.   On the up side, we ordered takoyaki as our appetizers. It was our first time trying it and it was actually tasty. I expected them to be bigger cuz the pictures on Yelp made it look huge but they were small.   Customer service was ok. Even after we received our appetizers, we were still missing 3 plates and 3 sets of silverware so I had my son walk up to the waitress to ask her and my son brought us back all the plates and silverware to our table himself.  Overall, we were disappointed. I don't know if it was an off day for this place. I'm sure they have a lot of potential reading all the great reviews. I don't think we'll be coming back.",

I was happy to see this restaurant was much bigger with bar seating as well as a good amount of booths and tables -- and we were seated right away! The great service and consistent food has made this our go-to ramen spot since it's just a minute from our house (and we can eat right away)!   Some faves:  - SEAWEED SALAD ($3.25): Appetizer side size of seaweed salad topped with sesame seeds and a side of lemon. - FRIED OYSTERS ($4.95): Four decent sized oysters deep fried, served with a side of lemon.  - OXTAIL RAMEN ($9.75): Oxtail, bean sprouts, scallion, eggs, seaweed, wood fungus  - TONKOTSU RAMEN ($8.95): Chashu pork, bean sprouts, scallion, wood fungus, egg, seaweed - HOUSE SALMON ($9.25): Salmon served with a light salad - CHICKEN KATSU ($8.75): Chicken katsu cutlet served with a light salad  The service along has us wanting to come back here! Extremely friendly, attentive... oh, and they gave us free green tea mochi also for dessert! OH OHJAH, we will definitely be back! :)",

There were tables with dishes piled but no one there to clean it up.   I have to say the noodles/soups were delicious. It's just sad that they had one person going up and down the room doing all the duties. Also, people were writing their names down on the wait list but it would take forever for them to get seated while there were just dirty/empty tables.   The location has a cute aesthetic; you can even see the cooks/chefs through a glass wall. Theres a bar right next to the chefs as well.   I will have to stop by again and see if maybe Friday, oct. 19th was just an off day for them. I did enjoy the noodles and hope to change my review once I return.",

If anyone is planning on opening a ramen shop even in Vegas, please do a little bit more research.

I've now dined in here and gotten to-go and both were excellent. Thinking I was not a fan of ramen, I ordered the house fried noodles, which were great but noodles are great a lot of places. For my Postmates (and at the urging of my more gastronomical adventurous friend), I tried the ramen.   My first ramen foray was the Tan Tan Men. This sounded the least intimidating and had no words that I needed to google. Added the chili paste to get the party started. Sweet mother. That ramen was a flavor explosion. Nothing like the top ramen of my childhood.  I am now a ramen convert.  I am also a big fan of the spicy, garlic edamame.  Just a little heat so don't be scared. I've even tried the Tako Wasabi (how's that for wild?!) but that may be my line. While I love sushi, raw octopus is not my bag.  I am so excited for the culinary additions to the Southwest. Ohjah Noodle House is 5 stars!",

    "text": "Definitely my husband & I's go-to spot. We keep trying new ramen spots but we seem to keep coming back here.  We usually have a personal checklist on what makes a ramen good: ramen broth is piping hot when it comes to your table, ramen broth is not that salty, generous portion, thick pieces of well-cooked chasu, more than two pieces of said chasu and options to adjust the spiciness with free chili powder on table. Ohjah checks all of these.  Just in the last two weeks, we tried two other ramen spots in town that got us disappointed and craving for Ohjah right after.  We also love how they make their takoyaki. They never over-mayo it, drown it in sauce or put little bonito flakes. They make it right every single time (just look at the pictures on here, it's consistent). You can't go wrong with the house fried rice either. The portion is large for $5.75 and it's delicious too!  My go-to is definitely the Miso Ramen, for sure. My husband loves the Tonkotsu and Shrimp Tempura Ramen. We know traditionally, ramen spots are small and not group-friendly but Ohjah is! The service is also so friendly and we love that little green candy at the end of the meal too. After trying about 7 or so ramen places in town in the last year, this is still our favorite.",

Service:  We were seated immediately, ordered and the food came out quickly and with a smile.  Drinks were kept fresh and management stopped by to check on us.  Nearly identical great service that I experienced at Ohjah House #2.  Ramen & Non-Ramen:  Was feeling hungry so I went with the heavy Ohjah Ramen and resquested extra spicy: Oxtail, Beef, Chashu, Egg, Bean Sprouts, Scallion, Seaweed, Wood Fungus, & spinach.  The broth was great and not really spicey in my opinion, I gauge that by how much I sweat.  I didn't sweat much but it was still tasty and the noodles were yum.  The yaki Gyoza and fried oysters were good if you're fiending them.  The Kimcho fried rice was my favorite Non-Ramen dish, definitely ordering again.  Ambiance: Again, nearly identical to Ohjah House #2 with lots of wooden tables, walls and benches to give me that Ramen House feel I had when I visited Tokyo.  Lots of booths, tables, and a Ramen Bar to seat parties quickly.  Most good Ramen joints are notoriously associated with a lack of seating and long waits.  I'm so glad that Ohjah doesn't have that problem at either location and which is why they get the 5th star.  The OG Ohjah Noodle House set the precedence for House #2 and they're both fantastic noodle houses on opposite sides of the valley.  If you're in the area and are fiending Ramen, the OG Ohjah Noodle House and the 2nd house is the place to be.  Enjoy yourself..",

We went around 430ish and it wasnt busy at all. Sitting is very spacious and very open which is very rare for Japanese Ramen houses, menu is decent, just enough options to choose from, prices are very affordable too. Ohjah has other restaurants in our valley and each location has different specialties, obviously ours were Ramen.  We tried the typical Tonkatsu Ramen- Perfect combination just wish they give more soup. Oxtail Ramen- my favorite Ramen I've had in Vegas so far, also wish it had more soup base but it was soooo good, base on the light side and very flavorful. Takoyaki- kind of fell on our boring side, it had a very poor filling with maybe just one tiny piece of Tako in each individual one.  Deep fried Oyster- was just okay, your regular panko breading with no special katsu sauce.",

    "text": "This is my favorite ramen spot to date. It's out of the way from home, but worth the drive for us. Plus my office just moved in the area, so that's a score!  I always use to avoid eating ramen since the restaurants around town are always tiny and crazy packed when the weather is cold or rainy. Waiting 30+ minutes is not worth it (Especially when I'm already hangry.) We use to frequent Jinya, but I started to notice that they screw you on toppings and broth. The price is steep for add-ons and they just don't hook it up like they use to. Thier service is lacking as well. They use to be my #1 spot when they opened a few years back and sadly they slowly went downhill from there. Props to their takoyaki though!   OHJAH warmed up to me quickly (like a comforting bowl of ramen). Here's why:  1. We never have to wait for a table  2. Attentive service & employees are eager to help 3. Food served shockingly quick 4. Quality ingredients with wholesome, flavorful & balanced broth (not too oily, salty or light) 5. Thick, perfectly meaty and fatty sliced chashu! Totally drool worthy! Order extra always!  6. Prices are reasonable, it isn't $5 for 2 thinly sliced paper-thin chasu like every other ramen joint 7. Most importantly they do not skimp on the toppings or broth! I hope that never changes!   *Recommendations:  The takoyaki is great 4/5  The tonkatsu is my favorite 5/5  My toppings: chashu, menma (bamboo), scallion, soft boiled egg, corn, seaweed, wood ear mushrooms 5/5   *Pro tip: Ask for these toppings on the side: black garlic oil & spicy chili paste. They add a nice kick to your ramen and it isn't overly spicy. It's just an extra $1 for the chili and $1 for the garlic oil, but definitely enough to split between two people! Add it to your broth to taste 5/5  *Secret menu: Garlic lover? Ask for the fresh garlic. They hand you a tool to crush the bulbs yourself, then blend the crushed garlic into your broth! Really packs a flavorful punch. We love it. 5/5",

    "text": "Delicious Ramen!  Randomly found this place while searching for places to dine outside of Las Vegas. Dining on the Strip tend to be costly since 85% of the people that go there are tourists, 10% of the people probably work there and maybe some 5% are locals that party there. That is my non-scientific prediction. LoL!  Still in Las Vegas it is about 11 miles from where we were staying at the Hard Rock Cafe on Paradise Rd. No crowds, although, I heard this place does get crowded. Had lunch here on a Saturday afternoon. I ordered the Miso Ramen (bean sprouts for crunch, scallions for flavor, soy-cured egg half with a bouncy firmness, seaweed, wood fungus [kikurage], fish cake, chashu and ground pork topped with a square of nori on the side). So good and yummy!  Hubby enjoyed his Beef Ramen, who likes it hot and spicy, while our teen ordered her favorite shrimp tempura.   The inside is spacious and the tables were spaced out nicely (compared to our local Ramen House Ryujin in Sacramento). The interior decor is nice and modern with Asian flair. Very clean. The service was fast. We got our food in fairly good time. The servers were friendly and attentive to our table. It was a nice treat to be able to dine here. We will certainly come back again on our next Vegas visit! The restaurant is located on the corner of a shopping plaza with plenty of parking.  Review #0905",

    "text": "Tried their tantan ramen for dinner over the weekend. The ramen tasted good. The noodles were cooked nicely and the broth (chicken based for tantan ramen) wasn't overly salty. My friend had their shrimp tempura ramen and she enjoyed it as well.  For the price, i think the portion is decent and it is filling to me. I think they could've given more toppings though (they gave a stingy one sheet of nori for the ramen). Their service was great. The waiter came by several times throughout our dinner and checked to see if everything was ok and if we needed anything else.   However, they forgot to put egg in my ramen (see picture) and I didn't realize it until after I left. I had thought something was missing from my ramen, but I was too busy chatting with my friend and couldn't figure what was missing until after I got home LOL. For this lack attention to detail, I took off one star.   The ramen I tried was good enough for me to want to come back and try other items on their menu. Do I think this is a 5 star ramen place? Nope. If you're looking for that in Vegas, try Fukumimi (tastier ramen that came with more toppings for a cheaper price). However, in my opinion, this place is better than Ramen Kobo just down the road and I don't have to drive over 30 minutes to get to it.",

I have tried ramen now several times at many places and have just come to terms with the fact that the meats used in ramen are usually pretty fatty. I am fine with picking around the fat to taste the delicious meat. Keep this in mind though if you don't enjoy fattier meat. I also got the potstickers and they were really good too! Above all, the service was great. Almost everyone working talked to me and asked how I was and if I'd been there before. They were all lovely to chat with and watching them prepare the food was enjoyable because I ate alone. In all, great people and service is what keeps me going back to a restaurant and this will be the case here too.",

The best thing about this restaurant is their service. One server in particular, has very good manners, stands at your eye level when taking orders, and always knows when to refill our water or teas. The only downside of this restaurant is the quantity of the appetizers. The chicken wings dont have a lot of meat. In comparison to other ramen shops, I would rate this place top second in vegas for its shorter wait times and good location, but lacking on the noodle quality like monta. This is coming from someone who eats ramen in other countries and have tried all the ramen places in vegas. If youre in the area, this place is 100% better than kobo.",

My thing with gyoza is I always calculate the price per gyoza (yes I'm that friend) and if it's about $1/per I won't get it since it won't be worth it price and portion. I opt out here since it was $4.75 for 5 pieces.  My friend got the TanTan Men, Bun got the Tonkatsu and I got Miso. My friend liked the TanTan Men but Bun didn't like the Tonkatsu. The most memorable item in my bowl.. was the naruto! hehe I love fishcake, it was thicker cut than normal so I was happy  The ramen itself was meh. I asked for chili oil twice - I had a feeling the first time I asked, they were intentionally hoarding it but then Bun asked for me and it was delivered - this helped made it easier for me to finish my bowl, unfortunately Bun didn't finish his haha   The bill was split - Bun and my bowl were under $20 so it was standard. It wasn't very memorable and I wouldn't go back unless a friend picked it, or it was the only left thing around that is open. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either.",

On my last visit here, I ordered the Ohjah Ramen, which includes oxtail, beef, chashu, and egg as the main proteins. The oxtail was super tender (side note: it's not often I come across tender oxtail meat)! I also ordered gyoza, which also did not disappoint.  I was, however, a bit disappointed that they didn't have regular coke available at the time, but the hot green tea made up for it. I usually don't drink a hot beverage with my ramen, but they had my favorite green tea with brown rice (genmaicha) which I think goes very well with the bold pork broth.  Service is great. Nothing to really complain about. They have a good variety of ramen choices, so I will be back to try more!",

When I'm in the mood for ramen I don't usually like to drive far so up until now Ramen Kobo had been our quick go to spot. Ohjah was a nice change of pace! They have a nice variety of ramen to choose from, with very reasonable prices.  Also love how they have other appetizers and main dishes to choose from as well.  The restaurant itself is spacious and comforts ale. Staff was very attentive and friendly, not the fastest service but it's still their soft opening!   We tried the seafood ramen, tan tan men, and ohjah house ramen. Although not stated on the menu they can customize the spice level. Medium spice here was just enough to give you nice flavor without burning you up. Mild was basically no spice. The ramen broth is creamy and hearty. Seafood ramen had a whole assortment of seafood including fish, shrimp, clams, crab legs, squid along with the veggies and seaweed. The ohjah house ramen had tender oxtail included which I was surprised to see, but great flavor!  I also commend them on the soft boiled egg which you don't have to pay extra for in there ramen. For me ramen isn't complete without it!",

The waiters are very friendly and attentive and will really make your meal as pleasurable as possible.    I ordered the tonkatsu - extra spicy.  The waiter even gave me my own bowl of chili oil and paste to spice up the broth to a whole other level if I chose.  The broth was good and noodles were fine.  Spice level was above average but not too bad.  Noodles could have been thicker but still tasty.  The chasu was melt in your mouth.  The best part about the meal was the chasu while the rest of the dish was just a very good bowl of ramen.  Total cost was about $10 which is a normal cost for ramen in Vegas.  I really hope they open another Noodle House location in Summerlin because I hate having to drive all the way south or to China Town to get a quality bowl of ramen.  But if I'm in the area, Ohjah would be a nice eating spot no doubt.",

The place wasn't busy at all which is weird for a Friday night in this area. The decor is really nice, and the staff is attentive.   I ordered the Ohjah house ramen and a side of gyoza. The house ramen comes with some oxtail, some chashu pork, and all the other standard ramen stuff in (I think) a tonkatsu broth. I asked for a medium level spicy.   The broth came out warm but not really hot. The spice was more of a pepper type spice instead of a chili type. It wasn't spicy at all, just heavily peppered. Since the broth wasn't that hot, none of the fat on the oxtail really cooked making it mostly not edible. The noodles were good, but nothing special. The gyoza were pretty decent, but the sauce that came with them was bland.  The reason I feel jaded is because there's a ramen place walking distance that's so much better. Overall, I'm undecided if I'd come back. If you want ramen, and don't want to wait an hour at the place next door, then this place is probably ok. It will suffice for a ramen craving.",

Don't really know the difference between the miso broth or the tonkatsu broth.   Ramen during summer is not a good combo too but my grandma is staying with me for a month and she loves any noodles with soup so Ohjah was close enough to the house for me to accommodate her request.   My mom and grandma knew exactly what to get, while i literally just got noodles in chicken broth for my daughter and I got chicken katsu.  I didn't try the shrimp tempura ramen my grandma ordered because she enjoyed it so much that she wasn't willing to share. I knew she liked her food because she ate her dish while her eyes were closed.  That along made the drive worth it for me!   Takoyaki and shrimp ball appetizer was ok. Chicken katsu was as expected (this was my safe order). What pleasantly surprised me was the plain noodles in chicken broth. The broth was good. It's the kind of stuff you would want to have when your feeling under the weather or during winter time.   I will most likely come back and try Ohjah Noodle house again and will be more adventurous in my order.",

    "text": "First let me say that I am no Ramon expert. I recently moved to Las Vegas and there are a whole lot of Ramon restaurants in my vicinity. I wanted to see what the hubbub was all about. It can't be the same as the Top Ramon in the stores - or could it? I certainly hoped not.  We arrived at Ohjah Noodle house and were immediately greeted and we sat ourselves as the place was virtually empty (Monday night at 7pm).  Our drink order was quickly taken and the menu thoroughly explained. We ordered Gyoza as an appetizer while the waitress went for our drinks. She quickly returned and lefy the drinks and took our order: Chicken Katsu for my wife, and Oxtail Ramon for me.  The Gyoza was very good. It was just crispy enough to please but not be too crunchy to chew or dry out the contents. The accompanying sauce was nice.  The chicken katsu was moist and tender with just enough crispiness on the coating. The ponzu sauce was very flavorful and added to the experience.  The Oxtail Ramon was much better than I was expecting. The broth was not salty as I was expecting (remember I was thinking store bought Top Ramon here). The meats, seaweed, eggs and noodles were appealing to the eye and taste buds....especially the oxtail bones and pork tenderloin.  I don't know if this was indicative on what to expect from now on with Ramon restaurants. I just know I will definitely be returning here again.",

It was both easy and convenient, perfect for a weekday meal.  The order was delivered in under 30 minutes, much quicker than 45-60 minute estimate. This was our first order with them and it for sure won't be our last. We ordered 2 Tonkotsu Ramen with extra shrimp, pork and egg. The order was perfect and so good. We can't wait to try everything they have to offer.",

I had the beef ramen which had broth that was a meal in itself and complimented nicely with noodles, egg, seaweed, and bean sprouts. The beef was cut thick enough to were it doesn't overpower the ramen. She had the miso ramen which also had amazing broth and had pieces of tonkatsu that were a perfect companion to the noodles. We had the octopus balls which were very similar to the ones we had in Tokyo with the creamy sauce and fish flakes. Will definitely go back here.",

That does not mean the ramen is not good, it just means there is plenty of space and tables. Unlike most ramen places with a few tables and a long wait, I have always been able to eat within in ten minutes of me entering Ohjah!   I have tried the Shrimp ramen, the Beef Ramen and the Fried Rice. All were very good and flavorful. The beef in the Beef ramen are nice thick slices and pretty hearty especially on a cold day.    The service is always friendly and attentive, making sure that we always have everything we need. The restaurant is very clean and has a modern feel to the restaurant. It is also quite spacious so you do not feel like you are sitting on people's laps like other ramen houses.   This is a good one folks!",

The gyoza came first and it taste delicious with their dipping sauce. Our ramen was delicious and full of veggies. Their broth tasted great and it was seasoned to perfection. Last to arrive was the fried noodles. They were so tasty and it was a huge portion.   Staff came around at least three times to makw sure we were okay. At the end, they even boxed the food for us. Overall, a great experience and im glad we found this little gem!",

Great suggested as we sat in a warmer area of the restaurant.   We started with fried chicken tenders to share. They were nice and hot and the sweet spicy sauce was yummy. Definitely a nice size serving to share. Two of us got the miso ramen made with both chicken and pork broth. It came with all the goodies, pork belly (although a bit chewy), scallions, seaweed, mushrooms, egg, and lots of tender yummy noodles. The broth was delicious with just the right amount of heat. We also had chili paste and ground chili powder at our table if you wanted to turn up the heat. I like that they do not use MSG and they make broth fresh every day. Another person got the tonkashu ramen and he loved it and ate all of it too!! The service was excellent..we were all very satisfied. I will be back!",

That was pretty cool of her to keep a lookout for us. We sat at a nice cozy, warm spot, away from any draft of the front door.   We started off with some kikurage, deep fried chicken breast pieces with a light, crunchy batter. It came with a spicy sweet sauce and ranch dressing. Piping hot and delicious.   So I asked the waitress, \"Does the broth have MSG?\". She stated, no MSG, we make our broth fresh every day. Winner Winner!!! Love it. I ordered the Tonkashu ramen with extra Chashu. The bowl came with egg, seaweed, scallions, Kikurage (black mushrooms), egg, spinach, lots of noodles, Chashu and a delicious, creamy broth.  I usually don't eat much of the broth, but it was so good, I finished almost all of it. The bowl came with two pieces of the Chashu, but for $2 more I got an extra 4 pieces. I'll be back.",

First off, the service was very slow. It's getting cold here in Vegas and I understand that many people want to eat ramen right now. But, the restaurant wasn't a full house. There were at least 4 empty tables and the three employees that were working just could not keep up with everything going on. One of the servers took our order to another table at first because I heard them saying, \"uh no, we didn't order 2 Miso Ramens...\" Then she took it back to the counter and the other server had to point out our correct table. I don't like that. Even though technically no one touched our food, it still made more stops than needed, lol. I mean what if someone's spit accidentally got into the ramen while talking? You never know right??  I'm not sure if they changed the type of noodles they used or if they were just cooked poorly, but they were pretty soggy. I believe the ramen was also supposed to come with ground pork and fish cake, but I didn't get any of that. The Miso broth was still good though.  So yeah, not sure if there was a change in management/ownership, if they changed up some of their ingredients, or if we dined in on a really off day. It was just kind of disappointing.",

Staff were incredibly friendly and responsive and overall did a great job.   We tried the fried gyoza to start which was good. Crispy and juicy though tasted a bit like it had been frozen rather than made freshly in the restaurant. Then I tried the chicken katsu. This was decent. The chicken was not amazingly tender and was a bit on the dry side. We also had the fried rice. This was probably the best part of the meal as it was tasty and not overly greasy. They did have fountain soda drinks and were quick to keep the drinks refilled.   Overall this was a pretty decent meal though nothing really set it apart as amazing.",

Soooo I waited until they were very hungry and success! They ate it all. The food was amazing! Not too salty and seasoned perfectly.   The restaurant is very cozy and nicely decorated. Plenty of room for us three and the stroller for my four month old. The waitress was very friendly and helped me order for the boys. She was so good with my kids too! She gave them drinks to go without me asking and was right there to pick up any trash or empty plates. Five star service! I was deciding on this place or another ramen place down the street. Both get good reviews. I chose this place because someone mentioned there is more room here compared to the other place. Seeing that I had three kids, a stroller for the third kid and a huge SUV to park, I chose this place for the accessibility. I drove past each place and parking was tight at the other location. So very glad we made the right choice. We will definitely be visiting here often!",

Food was good,  even this place does not make their own noodles but ramen soft slight chewy and not soggy. Broth isn't salty. Fried rice also very decent with great amount of char siu. Over all prices were very reasonable for theirs portions. Place is huge and clean  Definitely will be back and so glad we found a place that sell fried oysters  Wish the fried oysters would accompany with wasabi mayo instead of some type of Asian oyster sauce flavor",

I like the extensive menu, being able to customize, and the choice of non-traditional toppings. I also like being able to adjust the spiciness of the broth. Just a star off for the noodles as they were on the chewy side. The gyoza was grilled perfectly. The miso and house ramen were good, but the tantan men was just a little bitter for my liking. Extra broth was on the house - yay! Will come back next time for the other types of ramen as well as for dessert.",

In particular, the pork was sublime, as the cut of pork was tender and practically melted in my mouth. The oxtail was also fantastic as it fell off the bone......still can't get over the broth, though. Highly recommended. Great service and great food.",

The food was edible, but not in the same ballpark as some of the other places we've been.  Left us wanting Ramen Kobo, Monta or Jinya.",

The amount you get is a little less than what you would get at Sora or other ramen joints, but the quality exceeds all. The employees are very friendly and very helpful. I personally like spicy ramen, but when I found that it wasn't spicy enough, they quickly brought out some chili oil to help increase the spice level. I will be coming here more often as it is the best ramen in town.",

I love my food spicy so I asked if they can make it spicy. They had mild, medium and extra spicy. I had them make it extra spicy.   The miso ramen was bland, along with the noodles. Because I ordered it extra spicy it did have a kick to it, but that's all. The chashu that came with the miso had a weird smell/taste to it. It had a pork smell/taste to it like they didn't prepare the meat prior to cooking.   The chicken wings was not bad. Just like regular deep fried wings. Very small wings. But they were good. Crispy on the outside. Given with a sweet chili dipping sauce.   Overall, it was quite disappointing. I may give it another chance with a different ramen off their menu. But not anytime soon.",

Offers excellent values too, all ramen are under $10 with large portion with toppings!  Service is also excellent- meaning they have the sense of what customer needs- with kids, they will bring out kids bowl, plastic utensil, extra napkins. And continuous checking if the food is ok and if you need anything else.   That is good enough for me to earn 5 stars for a Ramen noodle house.",

    "text": "Hmmm...good ramen but nothing stands out as spectacular.....So, I've been going to Monta Chaya on Eastern for a couple of years and when that joint closed,  God knows why, I'm still sad about this by the way...their ramen was to die for  and since then, I was in the hunt for another ramen restaurant  that can equally match MC. I yelped other places and thought this place have good reviews. I ordered take out and  got the Ohjah  ramen  with a combination of beef, oxtail, Chashu  in tonkotsu broth ( rich and milky broth from pork bones cooked for hours.) this broth is really amazing among all other broths. I personally think that if a good ramen joint is serving amazing tonkotsu broth, then I would think the miso and Shoyo broths are equally spectacular.  I got home and poured out the soup in a ceramic bowl. Well, I don't see the egg.  They all come with half a slice of egg. Oookay?! So far, my tonkotsu broth is good and surprisingly not salty compared to most ramen restaurants. ...and that was a big plus, and a minus for no egg.  Would I go back?  Yeah I would but I wouldn't consider it the best. They have another restaurant in Henderson.  The server told me that it's more Japanese food  on the menu and no ramen except this location on Durango. I don't know whether she's new or giving me incorrect info., but it looks like the other restaurant is serving ramen as well.  Overall:  good ramen, not salty; amazing flavors?--nope. Gave 4 stars: it's better than the other places I've been to after Monta Chaya closed.",

We ordered the House Green Tea and Hot Sake, Miso Ramen Extra Spicy added chicken and the Tan Tan Men Medium Spicy.

Because sometimes I just don't feel like driving all the way to China Town, y'know?  Once you walk in, you immediately notice how spacious this place is. Compared to many of the other ramen restaurants in Vegas, which are tiny little spots.   My roomie and I were seated right away at a table. The servers were attentive, prompt, and friendly. We ordered: the Ohjah Special ramen with oxtail, Tonkatsu ramen, shrimp skewers, and the house fried rice.   My roomie loved the oxtail. She said it was juicy and fell right off the bone. She was also very impressed with the noodle to broth ratio. She said at some other ramen places there's either too many noodles or too much broth. And Ohjah nailed it with the noodle to broth ratio.  A server brought some spicy oil to our table. I added it to my Tonkatsu ramen and it made my dish taste much better (and this is coming from someone who usually stays away from spicy). The Tonkatsu broth was already flavorful prior to adding the spicy oil, however, it greatly enhanced my first time experience at Ohjah. The shrimp skewers were very tasty. The house fried rice was eh, nothing special. I probably won't order the house fried rice again.  At the end of our meal, a girl approached our table with a tablet to pay for our check. I'm still highly impressed with how technology works nowadays in regards to paying for meals at restaurants lol. Anyways, it was easy and simple.   Will be back to try the oxtail!",

Atmosphere: - comfortable  - not noisy - plenty of space for seating - clean Staff: - friendly - knowledgeable - doesn't rush  - recommends  Food: - delicious (doesn't beat Sora, but best on this side of town) - Asahi  (my favorite beer)  Again, we will be returning.

We needed something to give us fuel for our plane ride home and didn't want to be within a huge crowd, this place was the perfect spot for a quiet and calm meal. Not to mention the customer service was excellent. I especially loved how the employees were so friendly and kept that water coming.   Once we got our food, it was clear to see that their kitchen crew knew how to make a mean bowl of ramen. My broth had so much flavor, and my favorite part, was that I could ask for whole garlic to crush fresh into my bowl. The killer of the entire meal though, had to be their fried rice. It tasted like a teppanyaki style fried rice straight from the flat top. After leaving this place the first time, it became my prime destination spot when I returned to Vegas.",

We were immediately seated because they hadn't even had their soft opening yet and were still testing their menu and service. LEO was our server and he was so nice and kept bowing at us (just like in Japanese culture) Their menu is very simple and has about 5 ramen options DEF DEF DEF wanna go with the OX Tail Ramen with the Tonkatsu broth Other broths included Tan Tan, Shoyu, etc The Broth was sooo rich and the noodles, with the big chunks of beef and oxtail, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, and the slightly undercooked egg was one of the best dayum things I had ever eaten. We also tried the House fried rice (5.50$)- very large portion and still was delicious.  +++the guava a dessert candy they give u at the end is LIT and super tasty We will be back!!!!",

Ordered oxtail ramen, miso and beef and also had gyoza and fried oysters. Everything was delicious. Best ramen in the SW. Leo gave us great service and good food!

From previous post they have worked on cooking the oxtail longer and it came out very tender. Their broth was lacking flavor and the noodles that came with the oxtail ramen also not your typical ramen noodles, came out a bit over cooked and mushy. House fried rice was ok. Can't go wrong with fried oysters, nice and light panko batter. This place has potential.",

But if you need a recommendation you need try the special Ohjan house ramen. The Ox tail is tender and easy chewing, chashu is very yummy without a lot of grease. And their appetizers are fresh and quick serve. My favorite is definitely the Takoyaki. Their servers are very nice and helpful. Best advantage of this ramen house is it has a lot of parking space. You don't have to drive around to find parking.",

We will definitely be coming back anytime we're in the mood for ramen; it's my new fav.  Our server was Leo and he was outstanding! Knowing it was our first time he explained all of their menu choices and even gave us a little history on the owner and their other locations. He was so friendly, even taking the time to ask for our names and promising to remember them the next time we come back.  Everyone in my party had a different type of ramen and they were all very tasty. Their gyoza and garlic edamame was a great way to start the meal if you're really hungry. When we were done he brought us a complimentary piece of green tea cheesecake, it made for a refreshing end to a very satisfying meal.  Perfect blend of superb service and fantastic food served up in a beautiful space. Can't wait to return.",

Soup base has a lot of flavor and not salty. It includes many toppings that other place would charge. Therefore, good value. Staff is friendly. The place is nicely decorated and roomy.

We were seated the moment we walked in, drinks were brought to us instantly & before we knew it, our food was hot and ready! The staff there was so helpful and welcoming. The food was delicious. We didn't know what to order so they suggested the Miso Ramen & the Tan Tan Man Ramen and we were definitely not disappointed. The noodles were very well cooked, the broth was so tasty, and the toppings were fantastic. We had the green tea cheesecake for dessert and it was phenomenal. Would definitely recommend it!",

My husband found this place because we had ox tail Ramen in Hawaii and he fell in love with it and when he found out there was a place nearby that sold it we just had to visit. As a Korean and usually ox tail soup is more of a creamy white broth.. so when the ramen came out it was surprisingly regular but it had a huge oxtail bones with plenty of meat. I personally have a spinach allergy and I asked them to remove the spinach and I am happy to note that they did exactly what I requested.   The Ramen was really good not as good as the one in Hawaii but fairly good my husband thinks it was pretty decent and I really appreciate it how they had a lot of meat on the bone. The flavors were mixed well and I could see myself coming here again.",

For appetizers, we ordered the takoyaki and the fried oysters. It was really good as for the oysters were very soft and not too hard compared to other places. The takoyaki was way better than some of the places that I went in the past. I was more amazed with the ramen. The flavor was very deep and not bland at all. The seasoning was just perfect. Same for the Shoyu ramen, my friend was deeply impressed as it wasn't at all salty compared to the other ramen places. We were thoroughly impressed with this place and would definitely come back again~",

There's always room unlike other ramen places and the orders come out very quickly. Also at the end of your meal, they give you a piece of candy.

It almost reminded me of a very good version that I had in Osaka. Nicely done!!! I liked the crips exterior, and the inside was cooked just right.

The house fried rice was delicious - flavorful with pork and imitation crab. My husband had the House Oxtail ramen and while the noodles and broth were good, he said the oxtail was just okay. It didn't have a lot of meat and lacked the \"cooked all day, fall off the bones\" texture that oxtail lovers enjoy. Shrimp skewers were a 7 out of 10, okay but not worth ordering again.  Service was friendly and quick. The restaurant is spacious, open, clean and inviting. Other ramen places tend to be small and cramped, so this was a nice change!   Will definitely be adding this place to the rotation!",

    "text": "When it comes to ramen noodle houses, or any establishment that specializes in making soup, I am very picky about how the broth is made. When a soup's broth is too oily or salty, I can't stand to eat it. However, this place had none of those problems.  My friend and I ordered the Tan Tan Men (Spicy) and the Ohjah House Ramen. We also ordered two appetizers: gyoza and squid skewers (All of these are in the photo collage). Everything tasted great and we had no complaints about the freshness or quality of the food.  My friend ordered the Tan Tan Men and said it wasn't as spicy as she thought it would be. It had more of a sweet taste. The condiments on the table that could be added to any dish, such as the chili powder, helped give it more heat and flavor. If you want to add chili paste (topping), it's a dollar extra. I added it to my order, but the quantity that they gave was more like ten cents worth! It was a really tiny, tiny scoop of chili. For someone who can handle a lot of heat in her food, I could have done without it. It eventually got lost in the broth. lol  Pricing is about the same compared to other ramen houses and the staff's service was not bad. Our server wasn't as friendly and seemed to be a lil annoyed, but everyone else who came around was really nice.  I don't think I would travel all the way down to this part of town just to eat ramen here, but if I'm in the area, I won't totally write this place off. All in all, it's a nice neighborhood noodle house with a simple menu.",

The ox tail was a bit tough to eat and the broth was a little bland although it looked creamy. I would definitely try and go back at a later point in time and try a different dish if the outcome was different. The noodles reminded me of actual top ramen noodles.  Also, they didn't pick up their phone when we tried calling for take out so we had to go in and order. I'm sure the phone issue has been resolved since then as this was a few weeks ago. Overall I'm glad we have more options in the southwest for some noodles because there can never be enough noodles in ones life. Definitely an option to try if you've never been here because you may like it despite my opinion. =)",

    "text": "Creamy white broth, full body flavor.. in this satisfying bowl.. need I say more? Ramen game strong here in the Southwest, seriously!   You maybe familiar with Ohjah as they have sushi and steakhouse restaurants throughout the Vegas Valley.  This restaurant specializes in ramen only.  Basic bowl : The base includes Chashu, seaweed and bean sprouts. From there you can choose different broths stocks, Tonkatsu, Curry, Shoyu, Vegetable, and Miso.   There's also a selection of set of 'House Special Ramen' you can order.  Also as with Ramen-Ya in the valley , you can add addition toppings for additional charge.   I went for the Ohjah House Ramen from the House Special Ramen section.  Tonkatsu style broth, Oxtail, beef, Chashu, and soft boiled egg. When this huge hot steamy bowl was presented to me I knew I was goin to LOVE it! Man, that broth! Texture was like silky. Noodles are fresh, al dente, 2 bones of tender Oxtail, Chashu (pork belly) slice also dissolved when you took a bite. Perfect bowl of ramen! And it was just $9.75! Really reasonable price.   There are also appetizers you can get, but I just glossed over that part and did not read what they had since I wasn't super hungry, so I'll leave it up to you guys with the bigger appetite to report back on it.   I like that this place is spacious and not cramped like other noodle houses. Looks like they accommodate more people too. Kitchen is enclosed with window facing the dining area, so you have a clear view of what's going on in there.   Service was excellent! Host will take you to your table and will also be the one to check you out when you are ready to leave.  The servers were great! My order was taken promptly and came out quick. Kudos to the attentive server who offered more broth to warm up my ramen cause I got a little distracted taking pix. :/... that was really nice, he didn't have to do that. Thank you!   Anyway, if you are in the area near Ikea, btwn Sunset & Warm Springs on Durango , you'll find this place by the new EOS Fitness gym.  Definitely making this place my go-to for ramen out here.",

ONE single solitary piece of oxtail in a bowl of noodle soup for ten bucks is a bit steep. If you are craving oxtails, there are far better places to go. The vegetable ramen, fried rice, gyoza, karaage were average and the portions were small. If you are hungry, this is not the place to go.",

    "text": "This is the second ramen house in my neighborhood. I'm so happy that I have a choice.  I actually visited this location on a Saturday following their soft opening on a Thursday. So the restaurant was empty. They used this time to get the staff trained and work out any kinks. So it was really nice to hear the supervisor asking our opinion on how to better their services and soups. Honestly, although the new waitress was a little all over the place due to her too many \"supervisors\", she did great. There wasn't much I could contribute. However, I did think that the free cookies n cream mochi ice cream was a great addition. It nicely cleaned my palate after having ramen. Very refreshing.  So I was surprised on my second visit, with my family, that the menu looked totally different. It definitely was not a bad thing. The menu appears to be a copy of their take out menu. The one thing I do have to complain about is the font size for the ramen content. My vision isn't as sharp as it used to be so, so reading small teeny tiny font was a problem. But the servers are very helpful, so they didn't seem to mind having to read the content for me.  Although there is a ramen house in the next plaza, there are a few reasons why I like this place better:  1. Price: At least for the tonkatsu ramen, the basic content includes seaweed and egg for $8.95. The other ramen house, tonkatsu ramen is the same price, but you have to add seaweed and egg costing you about $11.  2. Restaurant size: both restaurants have great atmosphere. However, Ohjah is larger that they could actually fit more tables. As for the other ramen house, I believe it can only seat 16 at tables and 8 at the bar.  There is one thing that I believe the other ramen house has over Ohjah and that is the other restaurant's soup is a little more flavorful, but not by much.   Now as for the mochi ice cream, it isn't on the new menu, but hopefully they will add it in the future during the summer.  On my second visit, my niece and her husband were visiting us from the Arcadia/Monrovia/Azusa part of SoCal. These towns are known for their Asian restaurants and really good and cost savings. So I was a little worried as to what they would think. But they had nothing but good things to say. My nephew had the Ohjah House ramen was an oxtail ramen and included everything at a good price of $12.95. He looked very happy and content with the little beads of sweat coming down his forehead from making his own ramen extra spicy.  If my husband would let me, I would be at Ohjat on a daily basis :D  5-stars for Ohjah Noodle House!",

The fried Oysters had panko breading and were crispy, but not oily. I can't remember if it came with 4 or 5 pieces.   All in all we will be back. We need to try their Ramen!",

We had the takoyaki and garlic edemame for appetizers and they were both very good.  There was a perfect amount of garlic on the edemame and we had never had takoyaki before so we decided to give it a try.  It was a bit too mushy in the middle for me but the overall flavor was very good.  For our entrees we had the oxtail ramen and the house ramen.  There was oxtail in both and the flavor of the meat was just flat out amazing.  I've had oxtail at other places before but it has never been so flavorful and tender.    We will definitely be back!!",

I got the Special Ohjah House Ramen, which came with the option of either chicken broth or tonkatsu broth. I chose the tonkatsu broth because I liked the creamier brother. My friend ordered a shoyu ramen. For the appetizer, we ordered a takoyaki, which I heard good things about. The food came promptly and at the same time. The takoyaki was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside; the tako had the perfect texture. The special Ohjah House Ramen broth was at a nice consistency, and the flavor was amazing. The beef was tender and practically melted in my mouth. The noodles were also cooked perfectly. The Shoyu Ramen also had flavorful broth and well-cooked ingredients. Overall, Ohjah Noodle House does not disappoint. It is easily one of my favorite ramen places in Las Vegas.",

This place is really close to my house which is nice cause the other Ramen place I like is in China town its nice to have a place in the neighborhood thats really good. The prices are reasonable, the service is amazing, its clean, and the food is really good. We will be definitely making more trips here.",

I'm not used to this type of food, but it was good. Would recommend to anyone who likes these types of dishes because it was busy and other people seemed to enjoy it a lot.",
