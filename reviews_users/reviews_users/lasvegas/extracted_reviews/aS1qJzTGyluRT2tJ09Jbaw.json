While most of the servers are amazing the last time we went with our kids one of whom does not eat beef or pork. We ordered the volcano fried rice and were only told AFTER he started to cook it that it had pork in it.",

    "text": "Came in during lunch for a party of 6 and found the restaurant empty with plenty of parking.  We were promptly seated and although a bit apprehensive about the lack of customers, we ordered their large combos of both beef and pork.  Also added a melted cheese side that they melt on a small cast iron skillet on the table.  Being 6 of us, we opted for 2 grilling stations.  Maybe because they weren't any other customers around but the service was phenomenal with the server bouncing between the 2 grills and evenly dividing and mostly cooking the meats for us.  The meat quality was better than traditional K-BBQ joints and the variety of cuts, marinades and seasonings were pretty good.  One of the dishes was a meat sushi that they cook by torching at the table.  It was fun to watch and tasted great.  The melted cheese to fondue select cuts was interesting with the ladies enjoying it more than the guys.  The meal was very very filling but we had to taste the mool-naeng-myun.  They were nice enough to split up 1 order for us.  Very refreshing.  Oh yeah ... the last thing grilled was some shrimp that was peeled but not cleaned well.  This was the only disappointment.  Finally, they brought out marshmallows on a metal skewer for each of us to roast over the grill.  We made k-s'mores with Korean \"cracker\" and chocolate.  It should be noted they cook their \"cracker\" there.  Fun and Tasted Great!  All in all a nice surprise with a great meal.   I'll be back.",

All were great and they asked if we wanted more of them. The staff were so kind and attentive. All of our questions answered with a smile. The ambiance was great. I even  loved the Korean music k-pop. Felt like we were back in Korea! You know it's good when they welcome you in Korean and most of the guests are also Korean!

So, we ordered 3 different soups on the menu plus the volcanic fried rice. The Kim chee and tofu soups were just ok. Both were a little too sweet for our taste. As was the volcanic fried rice. We didn't get the BBQ which I'm guessing by their name is their specialty. The flavor for everything we ordered was a little too sweet for what we were looking for (warm, spicy soups on a cold winter night) but probably good flavor for BBQ. I'm not sure we will be back but if I'm ever in Vegas again craving BBQ will keep this place in mind.",

Ordered beef combo for 4 and spicy beef soup. We got banchan and japchae first. I started serving the japchae and our waitress goes \"You didn't order that!\" in an accusing scolding voice. (Like we grabbed it took it from someone?!) then she just shook her head and walked away. Meat arrived and was great but didn't get rice. When I asked, she asked how many. I asked for 5 because there were 5 of us. She brought 3 and said that's all they had. (??). They never asked once if we needed anything. Apparently, from other reviews, we were supposed to get dessert. We never did. Last straw - I asked for the bill, and she was just so rude, the way she tossed it in our table. Even my husband was mad at that point (and he NEVER gets mad). Told me not to leave any tip. I've never done this, but I left only 10% with a note saying \"worst service.\" I'm 100% Korean, visiting, and will be in vegas often with a child here in college. We will never be back.",

I've been a loyal customer for awhile lately. I legit come at LEAST twice a month. It use to be so much fun. The atmosphere use to be so happy and joyful. Now the waiters aren't as great. However, im just glad I got young. He is the only reason why i bother to come back. Young is a phenomenal waiter. He will cater to all your needs and can run multiple tables at a time making sure everyone's meat is cooked, everybody is enjoying their food, all the drinks are refilled. Honestly, without Young, this place is a donezo for me. I don't think i will return anymore, but if i do... im going to make sure i ask for young.   Service with young: 5/5!!! Amazing guy.   Food: 2/5 Back to the food: they still serve everything the same. However, i feel like all of their meat has gotten a bit more fat on them. Which means they opted for cheaper meat now. Not as high quality as it was back then.",

    "text": "When it comes to Korean BBQ, I can honestly say that I've experienced many BBQ restaurants across the country as well as overseas.  A lot of people I know prefer quantity and go with AYCE, and to that I say, \"to each their own.\"  Personally, I prefer quality and stumbled into Magal BBQ during a recent business trip.  Located off of the strip, Magal BBQ offers different cuts of beef presented on a multi-tiered platter.  The almost \"pre-fixed\" style menu gives you a chance to try different cuts of meat, while still having the option to order your favorite meat.  Quality of the meats is great.  I am a big fan of KHD, and Magal BBQ goes above and beyond to separate themselves from a crowd favorite.  The beef sushi was a nice touch, and is included with the dinner.  The complimentary Korean shaved ice dessert was a very nice touch.    Service was good.  In spite of the fact they were short handed the night I visited, our server was very attentive to our needs, made sure our water glasses were always full, and kept an eye out as our beer bottles started emptying lol.  The giant screen TV adds a nice touch, as well as the music playing aloud.  The interior decor is modern, the staff is friendly, and the overall vibe is nice.  Parking lot is big and free.  It is also about a $7 Uber from the Mirage.  Folks here speak English, can accommodate large parties.  Highly recommend Magal BBQ.   Enjoy!",

Luckily, my coworker's wife recommended that we try Magal BBQ, a Korean BBQ spot about a mile off the strip. So Wednesday night we walk in, starving after a day on our feet, and we were seated immediately. (party of 8)   Honestly, this place impressed the pants off me! I have had my fair share of delicious KBBQ and this place is right up there at the top of greatness. We ordered two large towers and a few pitchers of beer, and our two servers were so friendly and accommodating! They even split the meat up and divided it after cooking so that each half of the table could try both beef and pork!   The quality of the meat, service and atmosphere was above par and it was such a relief to be away from the hordes of people that were swarming the strip.   My hats off to ya, Magal BBQ!",

Similar to the Korean BBQ joints you find in NYC like I'm use to but the price and quantity/ quality is just incomparable.   We ordered a beef combo for 5 of us and we thought it wouldn't be enough. There was too much food. The quality of the whole meal was just great. The galbi and skirt steak were the best two meats they had. We ordered the seafood pancake as well. The pancake was a bit more \"broken\" then the ones I'm use to. It didn't hold together well but it tasted good.   Disclaimer: this is NOT AYCE. For about 18 each we had more than enough food. We came at the start of dinner and there was no wait to be seated. Our waiting staff was super nice. Water was never empty and alotof friendly conversations and recommendations.

    "text": "First: The service, fantastic, they assign a chef/waiter to your table who is responsible for taking care of you and cooking your food. Like most Korean BBQ all your meat and food is cooked at your table. We have been here multiple times and they are super friendly and I personally appreciate their effort as most places don't offer service like this.  Second: Food, mostly Pork and Beef with some squid, shrimp, chicken options. We went with the beef dinner for 2. Boy was that an understatement, more like food for 5 if you include all the side dishes and salads (thinly sliced daikon, seaweed salad, potato salad, kimchi, black sesame seed dressing with green salad, a couple others). The price is $$$ but for the quantity and service you receive it's more like $$.  Third: Ambiance is trendy, kick'n a variety of tunes a good sized eating area which is broken up into different areas. Parking is great as well as they have a large parking lot that is shared with just a couple businesses. That is unlike most of China town where it's a fight of patience to find any parking.  I would definitely recommend coming or at least trying it for yourself.",

It's spacious and has the usual trendy industrial decor with non-stop K-pop.   Important to know: No AYCE and No bulgolgi! If you order the meat combo then you will witness a very well rehearsed cooking display at your table. Meats are high quality, juicy; melt in your mouth for some cuts.   Where they missed the mark was the banchan. It was a strange array of items with the only familiar one being kimchi. We didn't care for the onions in sauce and a bizarre cilantro salad. No fish cake, sprouts, cucumber or veggie pancake.   Will return but maybe only when the wait is too long elsewhere. Hope that banchan will improve.",

If you get the beef combo, it comes with up to 5 different types of meat, along with some prawns and mushrooms to grill. They also include a spicy soup that comes bubbling in a clay pot. It says it feeds 2-3 on the menu, but it was more than enough for my family of 4!  One of my favorite things about their grill is that there are slots on the side for this corn salad, and steamed egg that has bits of Kimchi in it. All the side dishes they give with your meal are unique as well, such as this cold/spicy/savory acorn jelly soup, and black sesame dressing salad. Service was amazing and they attended our table with precision and frequency, like their APM was around 100 in Starcraft terms. Plus, our server gave us a free dessert at the end because we thought he was cool, and vice versa. Didn't get his name, but thank you cool guy!",

Most important tip: Get the volcano fried rice! We had a to wait a bit, but it was definitely worth it! However, you do have to order at least 2 servings. I really enjoyed the brisket and the marinade on the galbi was on point! To top it off, our waitress Dabin was so nice and attentive! Would recommend this place to a friend!",

This is a different experience from the normal KBBQ around town.  We ordered the small bbq combo. Quite pricey, but if you cut it in half, it's about the same price as AYCE, almost. The price includes service, I'm assuming. That's the catch, instead of you cooking, they cook for you. They're extremely attentitive, so you don't have to worry about over/undercooked.  At first glance, the grill has some corn and some soupy like liquid something on the side. That soup is actually egg, which gets cooked while they're cooking the meat. The side grill is a cooling rack.  The meat is different in quality compared to other KBBQ places. I wasn't sure what was being served/cooked, so I can't really tell you what tastes like what. Overall, the meat tastes amazing. It's tender and they cook it to medium rare. The main difference, to me, is the marinate. There's something about it that makes it taste... great and different. It might be the way they cook it too.",

The manager was exceptional and checked on us frequently.   The food was delectable. I usually judge a Korean restaurant based off of their side dishes and they have phenomenal kimchi. We ordered the beef combo which was definitely enough to feed two. My favorite meat was the kalbi. It was marinated to perfection and melts in your mouth. The combo came with soy bean paste soup, which I normally hate because of the unpleasant smell, but their soup made me have a change of heart. I love they change the grill after every meat so it doesn't build up with char.   Overall, I will be back because of the great food and ambience!",

    "text": "Not for me.  Ma Gal is a little different than the Korean BBQ places that I'm used to, not in a bad way but it's just not how I would prefer to eat Korean BBQ.  It has a modern approach - their plates are ala carte or they have combos. I went with my boyfriend late on a Friday night, it was my first time there and his second time. Because it's a different concept, I wish our server would have explained everything to us because it seemed like we didn't need to cook our food? They were going to take care of that for us?  We ordered the beef combo (beef brisket, we chose prime short ribs (vs. prime rib eye), marinated short rib, grilled prawns, grilled mushrooms, grilled pineapples, boneless short rib sushi, soybean paste soup). It was enough meat for two people.   I can tell they're really trying with their service but on more than one occasion, our server wouldn't really check up on us and our meat would burn. Now if it was established that we cook it ourselves, then I would have just taken care of cooking my own food and this could have easily been prevented. But it seemed as though the servers were there to talk us through the best way to eat it (like telling us to have the grilled pineapple with the marinated short rib, etc). I was not a fan of the short rib sushi, it comes out raw and then the server sears it with a blowtorch and drizzles on a sauce. The beef was practically drowned in what tasted like A1/steak sauce that you could hardly taste the quality of the beef.   The differences that I noticed were that: - Not your usual banchan, we received some scallion pancake, kim chi, salad with a black sesame dressing, sliced green onions/scallions, egg, corn, pickled vegetable - No rice paper available, everything's encouraged to eat with a side of rice - Grill set up is different, egg is cooked on the grill and there's a cooling rack for your cooked meats  Overall, it's a cool environment, very modern and hip. I noticed on their menu that they even have the option to add melty cheese to your food. I felt that I didn't enjoy it enough to justify their prices. Maybe I'm just a little more traditional and prefer to cook my own korean bbq and eat it with rice paper, no need for all the bells and whistles.",

    "text": "This place is certainly a unique experience.  I had never been to a Korean BBQ before and although it was a little confusing, I will definitely be back.    This is a good place to come in a group.  There were five of us and we were seated at table with a little grill in the middle.    The meal starts with a combination of appetizers and items to be used with grilling--although not clear to me the differences between the two.  The salad and kimchi were good--the kimchi was thankfully not too hot.  There was also an odd sweet soup--although we were not sure if it was a sauce or soup (although our server clarified that it was soup).  I did not care for that.    We ordered the beef combo, where you get five different meats along with prawns.  The meats were excellent.  Thankfully our server was there to cook the meat. --The first course was brisket, cut thinly.  Although a little fatty, it was tasty. --Second was a ribeye.  It could have have been seasoned better, but was cooked really well.  This was served with mushrooms--also good, but lacking seasoning. --Third was prime rib sushi which the server cooked using a little torch.  This was superb, I could have eaten ten of those. --Fourth was a skirt steak.  This had a wonderful marinade and was really good.  This was served with grilled pineapple which did not make sense. --The final  beef dish was short ribs.  They were heavenly. --It ended with prawns that again had no seasoning, but were still good.  To finish, the server brought out marshmallows, chocolate, and little rice cakes for S'mores.  This was a great finish and a lot of fun to make.  Their alcohol menu is limited and the tea they brought out was odd. It was barley-flavored and started hot, then was served cold later.  All during the meal the servers yelled out odd things.  I was not sure if it meantbsomething was on fire or more food was needed.  It was a fun experience with some very good food.",

Average beef dish is in the high $20s to $30s.  Their combo meat deal (beef or pork) for two people is well worth it; $99 for two people.  It is actually a very good deal to get the combo, which comes with all of the most popular cuts of meat (and a token shrimp).   The service is always attentive and the wait during peak times might be up to 45 minutes.  I try to go during off-peak hours and there usually is no wait.  Servers grill the meat for you and they know what they are doing; meat comes out just right, but if you prefer it cooked more then you should state your preference.   Btw, their herbal drink that comes complementary with the meal is so refreshing! There is no need to order a drink if you can have that awesome tea.",

My girlfriend likes their Mul Naengmyeon especially with the great lunch deal they offer. I was totally down for some cold soup action, but the Galbi Tang was just calling my name and I always find it hard to resist.  I went with the spicy version, which I guess on the menu is actually the Galbi Yukgaejang. In any case, it was absolutely delicious. The beef bones are gigantic, but the staff did an excellent job of cutting the meat from the bone before serving the bowl to me. It was one of the best galbi soups I've ever had (and at this point, it's almost an obsession of mine). There was barely a drop spared.  The girlfriend said her naengmyeon wasn't as good as her previous visit, but it tasted great to me. The banchan spread was also on point with good variety and quality.  Perhaps I'll try their BBQ one day. No guarantees.",

My family (5 of us) ordered the large beef combo and small pork combo and that was a ton of food! We also wanted to get the seafood pancake and volcano fried rice but our waitress told us that she will hold off on the fried rice in case we got too full, which was nice of her. But they forgot about our seafood pancake, we never got it but that was fine since everyone was stuffed.   Love the sides, they have different sides than most places. The tofu tasted really good, the salad had a delicious dressing, all veggies were so fresh. The kimchi was really good too, not to vinegary much better than other places. The meats were delicious, so tender and juicy. Each combo came with a soup and it was really good, I was stuffed but couldn't stop eating the soup. The dessert was really interesting, like shaved ice but very fine and snow-like, with the red bean on top which was really good.  I really liked our server, the efficiently cooked our meat without rushing us or being around too much. At other places they throw all our meats on the grill and moved so quick I felt pressured to eat quickly and get out, other places crowd you and were over attentive which can make the meal very annoying. Our server was perfect, he was around so we could ask for more sides, re-filled our drinks in a timely manner, and cooked our meat perfectly.   The con is the vent! The vent was huge but was so high up it did nothing, I sat in the middle and got ALL of the smoke in my face! Left the place smelling pretty delicious lol. But this is not a big deal to me at all, I never shower if I know I will be eating KBBQ so I always shower after which takes care of the smell.   Overall a really good experience. The food was delicious and of great quality, service was good, will definitely come back.",

Pork combo (Small $47.99 Large $79.99) which includes pork skirt meat, tenderized pork belly, special pork neck, marinated pork collar OR spicy marinated pork skirt meat, assorted grilled (prawns, mushroom, and pineapple), boneless short rib sushi, and soybean paste soup with beef brisket  Beef combo (Small $54.99 Large $89.99) which includes beef skirt meat, paper thin sliced prime brisket end-point, prime boneless short rib OR prime beef rib-eye, marinated prime short rib, assorted grilled (prawns, mushroom, and pineapple), boneless short rib sushi, and soybean paste soup with beef brisket  Skirt meat combo (Small $54.99 Large $89.99) which includes beef skirt meat, pork skirt meat, spicy marinated pork skirt meat, assorted grilled (prawns, mushroom, pineapple), boneless short rib sushi, soybean paste soup with beef brisket  As we were only a group of two, we opt'ed for the small beef combo. Service was pretty good. Side dishes were presented as soon as we sat down. They were refilled also as soon as they disappeared, and same for the water. Lots of banchan. Kimchi, two types of salad, pancake, marinated celery, a cold soup with i think acorn jelly, corn salad and egg in the grill ring (more on this later).   First came the boneless short rib sushi. Presented on top of formed sushi rice balls, the server takes a torch to cook the top of the meat. After they put a light sweet sauce over it. Purely entertainment value Lol. The sauce was much lighter than i expected. Though the meat was tender, it would be expected when its sliced so thin i hope   Brisket and rib-eye were cooked on a flat plate whereas the marinated short rib and beef skirt meat was cooked on a rack. Brisket and rib-eye were both unmarinated and were on the chewier side. Despite eating them before it was overcooked. The marinated short rib and beef skirt meat were pretty tender and not too heavy on the marinade. Would prefer slightly lighter flavor though. The \"grill\" itself was made of probably a cast iron with a ring outside for a prepared mixture of chopped kimchi and egg, and corn salad. It took quite a while for the egg to be done but once it was done, it went overcooked fast ! Entertainment value? yeah. looks nice to have a ring but i think i rather prefer it in the normal earthenware like the soup. Think i would have preferred if they had mozarella cheese in the ring like this chicken galbi i had in seoul vs the egg. XD hmmmm i miss that T_T   I wanted to order the volcano fried rice they had but it requires a minimum of 2 orders and we were only 2 people so no way we would have been able to finish it. Maybe another time :3   They have us two bite sized cheesecakes as a \"Dessert\" at the end. Hmm... Lol   As mentioned in the beginning, this was the last of the few new places that opened. I had previously tried the others and i prefer the other 2 over this place. Besides it being a la carte, i couldn't really tell the higher quality for the price in comparison to other restaurants. If anything, quality was similar to some AYCE's =3   Ventilation is quite bad despite it being a newly built building and i dont think their AC was working as they had a swamp cooler right next to us...   On the side note, their lunch specials seems to be decently priced. May try it out for lunch one day?",

The server for our table was extremely rude and irritable since we sat down. He served us with a poker face at first, after we asked him to refill side dishes and plates few times, he turned angry. While our short rib soup came, he slapped the soup bowl on the table and the hot soup almost splashed on our face. Another thing he did to us is that we couldn't keep our eyes open because of the heavy smoke from barbecue, after we requested the manager to change another server, we were told that the first server didn't turn on the range hood, that made us so mad. I actually want to give the place 0 rate if I can. The second server told us it was not the first time the server before had behaved in such a bad way, but he was not fired by the manager. I strongly suggest people never try this place.",

    "text": "I don't give 5 star reviews often, but when I do its because the place is amazing. Such is the case with magal.  Pros: I can't say enough good about this place. I lived in Korea for 2 years when I was in my early 20's so I know legit korean food and how it should be. To be concise, this is hands down the best korean foo h d qI've had in the last 8 years since I've been back home. And to be honest there is only one restaurant that I went to while I was in Korea that I can say I liked more than this. This place beats most of the places I went to while I lived there even. I can't belive it took me living here in vegas for a year and a half before I found magal. It is easily my favorite restaurant in las vegas I've found so far.  The service was amazing. Our server was super nice and helpful. They cook everything for you here. She brought out a bunch of extra side dishes when we went through them. The kimchi here rivals what I had while living there.  We ordered the beef combo for 4. All amazing. I'd never had pineapple as part of a korean bbq experience but I wasn't complaining when it was included.  Make sure you save room for the kimchi fried rice at the end. It is incredible. Next time we go I'm ordering more of that. I could eat 2 portions by myself. It really was THAT good.   Cons: ummmmmmm, maybe a little more extensive dessert selection. That would be nice.   Do yourself a favor and make this your new weekend dinner plan. You will not regret it.",

My girlfriend and I came this time and were a little disappointed when we were told they don't have the volcano rice (kimchi fried rice with scrambled eggs) at this time but that was 5 minutes after we placed the order that they came back and told us this. We ended up getting plain rice instead but honestly we came to this Korean BBQ because of the rice dish. Maybe next time they will have it available! Also normally when we come the waiter/waitress is pushy about them cooking the meat for you but we just told them right away when we came that we wanted to cook the meat and they were totally cool with it and just came over to change our grill out like most Korean BBQ places here in Vegas.  For sure will keep coming back but I might call ahead of time to check that they have the volcano rice since I was looking forward to that. Was very cool to get a complimentary dessert BUT...When there is a nut allergy in your party and they didn't ask ahead of time it was disappointing that the dessert is covered in nuts.",

Ubered our way here from Four Seasons took about 10 mins. First trip we came for lunch. I'm not the biggest meat eater as I wanted to order my usual japche and sodoku, my husband decided he wanted the BBQ. We choose the marinaded beef. The wait staff comes and start the grill- hey Mickie(excellent service)! And comes back to flip the meats until they are ready (cuts the meat and set aside) - even a BBQ- idiot wouldn't need to worry as they grill the meat. The bunchan were delicious and fresh. I always judge the bunchan as this is a good indication of what the rest of food will taste like. Back to the meats - fresh, fresh, and fresh! If not sure about how to pick (cuts vs marinated flavour profile, ask wait staff for recommendations!) the ventilation is set up well so you're not going to suffer a smoke inhalation, you may want to bring change of clothes as the scent will linger!!!(I had my jacket with me and some group of people commented about smelling of Korean BBQ AT THE AIRPORT!!)  Impeccable services, authentic noodle and stew dishes, well-marinated fresh meats- so good that we went back the next day for dinner and cancelled our anniversary dinner in somewhere fancy.  Definitely our eating spot next time we visit Vegas.",

The moment you sit down they hand you menus and delicious heottkae berry tea! This tea is the shiz! It tastes so good and its suppoed to be good for you - hangover cure, helps with liver damage, and digestive problems. They start preparing the table with alot of banchan dishes and they are also very delicious. I personally think that the black sesame salad is <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>. The boyfriend likes the pancake banchan and literally asks for like...10 refills HAHA.   The first time we went, we got the beef combo for 4 people. It is ALOT of food. They bring the meat out on a three tier metal plate. They serve you the meat in that order and they also cook it for you. They cut it and also make sure its cooked all the way. OH! they also give you this meat thing that comes out raw and then they use this fire thing to cook the meat on the rice - it looks like sushi. They then add some A1 sauce on top. Its pretty good Im not gonna lie.   The second time we went, we got the pork combo (which I personally liked better). It comes with my favorite meat HANG JUNG SAL!!! Our server was Jay this time around and we really liked him. He chatted with us and wasnt awkward at all when dealing with our food. Sometimes, I think that it is awkward when they lean over and cook your meat. I have to stop whatever conversation Im having so they can do what theyre doing. But Jay was really cool. He had a heart next to his name on his name tag so ask for him! This combo was for 2 and it was still enough food. We had to pack it to go.   I would definitely hit this place up if I were you! Jay told us this place is really busy on the weekends and on the weekdays it gets busy around 7pm.",

When we tried to cook our own food the server would say she had it but our BBQ grill went out twice and we had to wait to alert the server because ours disappeared. Place was pretty empty so no excuse!   At the last minute we were told that an item we were waiting for was not available. We were still hungry but they said last call at about 1230a when they said they close at 2am. The whole time it was hard to ignore another server talking to some other customers about how he'd much rather eat at Hobak than here. How he used to work at Hobak but quit due to not liking the management and kept calling the manager names. He also kept talking about other people he went to school with and calling them fat ***. An unpleasant experience. The food wasn't so bad but the service doesn't deserve a higher rating.",

Value here is what stands out, you get a lot of food in the beef or pork combo for $59.99! Even though it says for 2 people, it can easily feed 3-4 normal appetites.   Our server Jenny surprisingly had a very good sense of humor and was very fun and entertaining. Did not expect that at all from a Korean bbq restaurant. She gave us great service, cooked all the meats perfectly and always came back to check on us.   We've been here for dinner 3 times, now we've gotta come back and try the lunch...our friend told us the Korean cold noodles here \"SOOOO GOOOD!\"",

Always when I go I always think is this going to be enough but rolled out stuffed. I've tried all 3 combos and they all are great so do t worry if you have troubles choosing!  I didn't get the name of the server but he was awesome. He said he had a bit of a cold and said he was sorry which is a change from some servers not carrying and hacking right in front of you.  Decor is nice feels like an underground hang out. Dark with bright lights around your table so you can see what you're doing. One neat feature they have is a little red button that when push sends a server over to assist with whatever you need instead of trying to attempt to hail down the next person.  Well if you're in the mood for some quick Korean BBQ that tastes great go here you won't be mistaken!",

Definitely was memorable family dinner and served by one of the best servers I've seen in a long time!  *****Environment: The area is well spacious, lit and clean. There are bright lights to light up the area however they are not annoyingly blinding or bothersome. Also the they are very welcoming here, making sure to greet you in Korean everytime a new person walks in.   *****Food: The food was all around amazing. I definitely loved the Kimchi side dish, it had the right flavor, wasn't overly sour or spicy. We ordered the Large Combo and it was seriously enough food to go around. The combo consisted or many quality meats, my favorites being the short ribs, beef skirt and beef brisket. The meat was nicely cooked to your liking and is tender and punching with flavor with every bite! It makes my mouth watery talking about it again!  *****Service: The service here was excellent. Young, our server, was very knowledgable, sociable, and had the charisma to really keep the energy going in our party. It almost felt as if we knew him on a friendship level! He kindly cooked the meat for us and poured our Soju for us. We couldn't have ask for a better server!   Overall, I love this place, I will definitely return again when I visit in the near future and speak of this place again!   [ Taste it, Love it, Yelp it! ]",

We picked the all beef combo, an assortment of cuts of beef. We never ever get brisket because we just don't like it. We much rather have bulgogi(they didn't offer it) but brisket comes with the combo. It was fine though because every single cut was so quality, nothing was fatty, nothing was tough. The plain cuts really let us taste the quality of the meat. The marinated cut was also really good.   Service was great, they do everything for you. So the meat cooks perfectly and there is this beef over rice appetizer that they cook with a fire can. It was cool to watch. Everyone was really attentive and friendly. I don't see how they can improve any more.",

But the thing is the restaurant isn't full, and there were plenty seats outside could serve the other customers. Which I didn't want to argue with the tip part since my friends wanted to eat there.  And the third time when we went back is the LAST TIME I would want to go because when they agreed with 25% tips, they charged 35% afterwards without letting us know.  I found that out later on the second day when I checked the receipt. There are better korean bbq in town and with that kind of service and dishonesties, I would never return or recommend to anyone!",

It also had seared short rib sushi which they torch in front of you. I felt that the short rib sushi looked cooler than it tasted. The combo was more than enough food for us two without walking out feeling bloated. Could be enough for 3 people. We didn't even finish the last meat or the prawns towards the end. The meats tasted good (def better than meats at ayce KBBQ) but it was too fatty. Especially the brisket and kalbi. Probably the best thing in the beef combo was the boneless short ribs because it wasn't as fatty. The meat quality and cuts are better & actually worth the price at Hobak & Goong. They'll cook and cut the meats for you , dinner was still about 1.5 to 2 hours long. I'll probably try other a la carte items like the volcano fried rice or lunch specials next time. I also want to mention that they have this iced tea called Heotkkae berry tea that I looove. Definitely ask for that if you try this place out.",

This place has established its system but only problem I have with this place is service.  I hate inconsistent service but I really hate consistent bad service from one person.  I have been here about 7 times but we almost get the same person who has no flexibility and only care about how much more work this person have to do. When we order the combo we ask to split on both tables so everyone can enjoy but nope this person always cook different cuts on each table which means one table can not really enjoy the food without passing around the meat.  Another reason for me to go here is due to full service bbq. Employees cook the meat for you.  This is why I don't mind the high price tag and I do not feel like cheated when I tip.  Still best place to go in town imo if you have kids. You don't have to worry about cooking and watching the kids at the same time. They also have clean high chairs plus infant car seat holder as well.  Which is great amenity for people with young children.",

    "text": "Magal BBQ is a hip Korean BBQ spot with multiple locations around the world, mainly in Korea so I'm assuming it's a popular restaurant overseas since it's quite busy here all the time.  A casual environment with great atmosphere for group dining and selection of items on the menu.  The combo meals based on group size are very convenient and I recommend the Magal Combo for first timers.  Be advised that the portion for two people serves three comfortably so as not to over order.  It includes beef brisket, seared beef sushi, marinated steak, choice of pork jowl or belly, marinated short rib and marinated squid for grilling.  The side dishes and salads are plentiful and unlimited which compliment the meats very well.  I find myself picking at the sides before the grilling begins.  The mung bean soup that comes with the combo is very flavorful along with the cream corn and egg that fills the sides of the grill to go along as more sides.  What stands out the first time trying Magal is the huckleberry flavored water that becomes quite addicting.  Pricing is very reasonable for groups and the service is impeccable with a friendly staff that helps grill the main dishes.  Magal is always consistent and I find myself taking friends all the time!",

You can tell it's a great place because Koreans eat there and you ALWAYS trust a kbbq place where Koreans eat.    Service was a bit on the slow side since they only had like 3 poor staff serving everyone in the restaurant.  Our server was busy flipping meat for 3 tables in a row, which I felt was a bit stretched even if you're trying to save on labor.  Meat cuts are fresh and delish; next time I'd skip everything and just get marinated skirt meat, as that's what they're known for.  Everything else is really good too, but I just like the skirt cut so much I regret getting the combo.  Side dishes are authentic too, as well as the soju.  I'd come back here again since it's well worth your money and atmosphere is just perfect for kbbq.  Just remember, your clothes are going to reek of smoke as well as your hair but it's so worth it.",

There aren't many frills or bells and whistles; it's just fast, super friendly service with incredibly delicious meats cooked in front of you. The sides and accompaniments are too varied and too many to list there but safe to say there's something for everyone. I probably wouldn't recommend Magal to vegetarians but for everyone else visiting / living in Vegas, it's a must",

My wife and i waited patiently while the staffs clean the tables of others that left. The family waited before me was sitted while i was still waiting.  There were 6 empty tables avaliable,  but they kept me waiting for over 20mins. We havent had anything to eat since 10am due to busy schedule.  When we were sitted,  we waited another 15 minutes for one of the 6 staffs to come and took our order.  Heck,  the wait was very long. I order 2 tofu soup. And marinated pork.  They brought out one tofu soup.  I call the waiter over,  and told him that i had order two,  he told me that he only heard one.  While he went in to have the kitchen guy make another one,  i took out my utensil to clean it and i notice that the chopstick was dirty.  The grease was still on it,  the grease was dried up.  My wife spoon was dirty also.  I was starting to get sick.  I ask the same waiter for a new spoon and it took him over five minutes to grab one from another table to hand it to me.   While the food and everything was out.  I noticed that we were missing something else,  drinks.   Every table had tea,  so i called the same waiter over and told him,  \"do you guys offer water or something to drink? \" he went and grab a water container and went to the back of the kitchen.  I told my wife, \" watch,  he'll go to the back and pour us tap water instead.\". He brought the container out,  quickly my wife inspected what was in the contain and indeed it was tap water. We were grossed out.  Quickly i went and pay for the dinner and i had a talk with the cashier which i think was the manager at that time and she apologize. I do not know what the hell is going on with the five stars rating on this restruant,  but as a restruant reviewer this is absurd.  I give this place a 1 star rating due to customer service and sanitation. Even if your food is normal,  your customer service is what gives you the excellent business like.  Also sanitation is very important.",

We were waiting to order and absolutely none of the servers came with water or anything. We waited ANOTHER 20-30 minutes until I went up to one of the servers to ask if anyone was ever going to come get our order. The lady that I spoke to was very rude and told me to wait until she sent one of the servers over to our table. We then waited for ANOTHER 20 minutes or so and finally one comes to the table. We finally got to order but I saw that the table next to me that came AFTER us had already gotten their food... I guess we were invisible or something since they sat us near the corner of the restaurant.  Plus, how can they be so short-staffed on Christmas?!  I will NEVER be dining there again..I'd rather go to Hobak..lol",

    "text": "Anticipating the typical ridiculously long wait at another Korean BBQ hotspot on Spring Mountain, my group settled on going here instead expecting a good experience without as long a wait. We got what we wanted.  Ma Gal BBQ is one of the newer KBBQ joints in Las Vegas. They are located on their own, spacious parking lot across Spring Mountain from Chinatown Plaza, and they are easy enough to spot while driving by that I knew exactly where to go due to my occasional travel along this road. Note that there isn't an all you can eat option, which means that they're able to afford to serve higher-quality meat.  We had a group of 6, and I arrived to find one friend already seated and the servers seemingly patient to accommodate the rest of our party. I'm glad we're not a group of NFL linebackers or whatnot because they gave us a booth that would normally sit 4. I also constantly found myself unnerved by the unusually low table. Failing to find purchase for resting my elbows, I ended up using the narrow ledge on the divider for one elbow so that I could put myself at some ease. I know people praise the decor a lot, but the ergonomics leave something to be desired.  After we got a sufficient number of our party seated (one guy was running late), we got started with the food. They had already laid out the banchan and most of the condiments, and they cooked the meat fairly attentively, loading raw meat, turning half-cooked meat, rotating the grill plates, cutting pieces, and unloading finished product as necessary. We did pull some meats ourselves early, so it wasn't quite to the extent of having a cook standing there the entire time, but it was very helpful.  We enjoyed the following:  Bamboo Cold Noodles ($9.99) - we had these soups split into two portions for sharing, but we still got hefty portions of a somewhat sweet treat of green noodles that were very difficult to separate and lift. But once you got a mouthful, you couldn't help but keep slurping (or trying to slurp) those soft strings of goodness. I didn't even mind the lack of meat in this particular dish.  Pork Combo ($51.99 small size): pork skirt, knife-tenderized pork belly, special pork neck, marinated pork collar (chosen over spicy marinated skirt), prawns, boneless short rib sushi, soybean paste soup w/ beef brisket. Pork belly stood out the most, followed by the pork collar   Beef Combo ($98.99 large size): beef skirt, prime beef brisket, prime beef boneless short rib sushi (chosen over prime beef rib eye), marinated prime short rib, prawns, boneless short rib sushi, soybean paste soup w/ beef brisket. We started with the beef brisket, which was tender and tasty but not the most spectacular piece that I've had in the local KBBQ scene. That observation turned into a pattern with just about everything else - great but not stellar. The short rib \"sushi\" was solid but not especially something to write home about. The marinated meats in general stood out more for me than the rest.  In terms of the items found in both combos, I will say that the tofu and brisket soup was pretty addictive, and the shrimp was grilled head-on and were enjoyable (including the head pieces), but those aren't the reason you usually go to these kinds of restaurants. Also, there are egg and cheese corn available in wells specially built into the grills, and both were enjoyable bites.  Complimentary S'mores Dessert: at the very end of the meal, they brought out stacks of two rice crackers, each with a small chunk of Hershey's chocolate, and skewers with hefty marshmallows on them. They uncovered the fire and instructed us to roast those suckers, and I will admit that my technique could've benefitted from a handheld torch or something. I did get some browning, but I had to pull it away lest the marshmallow fall off the skewer.  That reminds me: I really liked their variant of the ubiquitous metal chopsticks. These have flat sides, unlike the perfectly round implements that I've had to use everywhere else. The struggle to keep the chopsticks still between bites was real, but not here. You can have peace of mind setting them down for once. Also contained in metal: steamed white rice, which is complimentary upon request. They don't offer rice paper, but I never really had KBBQ with that stuff anyway.  It's indeed not the best Korean BBQ in town, and it's not really cheaper than its competitors (I'm actually still a bit hungry), but Magal is still a worthwhile option if you want some solid full-service non-AYCE BBQ at peak dinner hours, especially with minimal wait time. Or if you actually want to watch TV on the TVs, such as the Thunder vs. Warriors game that was on tonight.",

This is my favorite sauce combo for korean BBQ meats.  Prime and short rib were good.  I thought the beef sushi was weird. Teriyaki sauce was on it.  The side dishes were a bit lacking. I didn't see too much besides kimchi that I liked. I really wanted potatoes or the fish cake!  The shaved ice dessert was good. I think it was supposed to be snow. The condensed milk topping was the best.",

There were several empty tables, but it still took us about 15 minutes to get seated. Shortly after we got seated, however, the entire restaurant was filled, and it was a madhouse in there.   We got the beef combo which included brisket, rib eye, and prime rib, and we also received some kind of beef sushi where they sear it in front of us. I thought it was wagyu or kobe beef, but it wasn't. The food was alright, but for some reason, the quality of the meat seems to be better at the Magal in LA. I think I've just been spoiled with really good Korean BBQ in LA that I automatically assume anything KBBQ is just better in LA.   Our server was really rude initially, probably due to my family's demanding requests for more banchan, but she definitely mellowed out throughout the course of the night. We were growing impatient due to our banchan barely getting re-filled, but she apologized saying that the kitchen was short staffed tonight and that they're really backed up. She also mentioned that she couldn't fry the rice at the end, because again, they were short on staff members, and it would just back up the service even more. Understandable but what a bummer, because I was looking forward to the fried rice.   Overall, it wasn't a terrible experience, but I would probably want to try Hobak first before coming back here.",

    "text": "So let me start off by saying that we love going to Korean/Japanese BBQ, and usually when we go (3 people total) we usually always order the large portion, from Hobak to 8oz and etc in las vegas, that's just the portion that fills us up and keeps us full. However coming here, we ordered a large the first time we came and lets just say we had to force ourselves to finish everything since we were from out of town. We learned from that time that Magal gives you ample meat portions. So keep that in mind. But on the quality, you really can't beat this place, we go into Vegas about 4-5 times a year, and we've been to Hobak a lot, but honestly this place blows Hobak out of the water, now that is, when Hobak first opened they were amazing, but now, it's lost its charm. But Magal has been around and has always impressed us. The meat is top quality, service is impeccable and we leave happy every time. Cannot wait to go back!",

So ladies you don't have to worry about anyone stealing your stuff while you are away.  I have only been here three times but each time the food is amazing.  Although this place is pretty pricy, their service is phenomenal. They even cook the meat for you so how can you not love this place. I recommend getting the combos because you get a variety of meats! Sadly compared to other restaurants this place doesn't have a lot of side dishes. I will definitely come back to try the korean dishes besides the BBQ when I'm not feeling too hungry.",

Can't believe the best Kbbq I had was in Las Vegas. Even the Korean Kbbq hot spots in NYC can't beat this! Everything was super delish, portions were big, service was on point, and prices were fair.

    "text": "Two new  Korean BBQ restaurants opened recently: Magal and Hobak.  They have a lot in common:  Both provide very high quality meat, unlike some of the AYCE Korean joints like Gen or Sura. Both are staffed with young Asian men and women brimming with positive energy.   (Speaking of brimming: Magal servers wear coolster fedora short-brims; Hobak is hatless).  Our server, Troy, was sensational: did all the prep work, all the cooking, was engaging, and  clearly committed to my group enjoying themselves.  Frankly, Troy should be running the restaurant, because the people who actually ARE running the restaurant have their heads up their asses (which may be why they are the only ones NOT wearing coolster fedora short-brims).  Here's why:  Magal does not have a wine list, so I brought a bottle of 2010 Bordeaux to go with the beef and the pork.  When I asked to have it opened, Troy informs me that corkage will be $25. It's corporate policy he says. And on top of that, they don't have proper wine glasses so we'll have to drink out of water glasses! WTF!  I ask to see the manager.  He slinks in, and I tell him two things: 1 - charging for corkage when the restaurant has no wine of their own is nothing short of stupid and punitive. 2 - Magal's main competition, Hobak, just up the street, encourages patrons to bring wine and charges zero corkage.  The manager listens. Says nothing. Then slinks away leaving a noticeable trail of slime as he goes.  Here's lesson #1 of any business:  It's easier to keep a customer, than to make a new customer.  That means when a buyer is participating in a business transaction, the seller should make sure the buyer leaves the transaction with a positive feeling.  BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT MAKES THEM COME BACK TO BUY AGAIN!!!!  The corporate braintrust of Magal must have missed that course at business school.  So which restaurant will still be in business in the next 12-24 months? Hobak or Magal?  My prediction is there will soon be a pile of used coolster fedora short-brims in the dumpster in the parking lot.",

There was a tofu beef soup (served warm) and a cream corn, egg with beef, pineapples and a few shrimp to throw on the grill.  Sunny was fantastic! In Hawaii we have to grill it up ourselves, Sunny did most of it for us. Please keep in mind it may have been because they were not as busy. But she did check in with us in appropriate time increments. The food was tasty and the environment was one to relax. However I could see individuals dressing up for a nice dinner out as well. We will be back when we come to Vegas again!",

We usually order the beef combo and it's good for two people who eat LOADS like my boyfriend and I (or for three people who eat like normal human beings). Let's not even forget about the sauce!!! I dip everything in their sauce!   As for the service, it's always a 50/50. Usually they're just doing their job. No complaints but nothing special to be all happy about either! The servers just walk around and flip your meat and cook it all for you, then move on to their next table and do the same. So don't expect a conversation with the server lol. They're just doing their job. But if you go around lunch time, they're not extremely busy so they usually take their time and talk to us then.   Overall, this is one of my favorite KBBQ places! It definitely is pricey so don't expect to spend under 40 bucks for a full meal unless you get an extremely small portion of something at lunch! I definitely suggest everyone try it here for a date night or a family dinner! One of the best :)",

We came in at around 6 pm and the place was not too packed with plenty of parking. We were seated promptly and were offered menu right away. I really wanted to try the volcano rice but it said on the menu that it requires at least 2 orders for them to make it. It's probably way too much food on top of the beef combo for the two of us but we added it anyways.   The first item that came was the beef sushi and the lady used a torch to sear it at our table. After the sushi she started grilling all kinds of top quality meat and everything tasted great. My favorite was the prime beef boneless short rib and I've been constantly craving it since. After we were done with our meats she took down the grill and started making the volcano fried rice. It had a nice presentation and did look like a volcano. One thing we'd hope to change would be to have them make the fried rice before we started grilling the meat so we can have rice with our meat.   I liked everything about this place. The restaurant looks extremely clean and the server was very attentive and managed to stay away while we were eating and would appear again right when we were finished to grill the next set of meat. Her timing was perfect. They offered ice barley tea instead of water which was very refreshing.   Overall I had a great experience and will most definitely be coming back to try out more of their items.",

We also had the best and most savvy server, Young. Armed with an expansive knowledge of the menu in its entirety, Young not only gave us information about what he was cooking in the middle of our table but also added tasty combinations paired with light airy anecdotes about his own cooking experiences.  The spicy squid that we paired with the sizzling cheese skillet was the perfect combination of sweet, salty, and spicy that tingles the taste buds in the best possible way. He made the experience more special than a regular outing with friends. Magal is simply the korean BBQ you can find. Totally recommended!",

Both spots are great, but Magal tends to beat Hobak in service by a nose. Every time I have come here with my boyfriend or best friends, the service quality is just more personable. They have always gone over the top to be friendly in offering extra sides after depletion and they go in depth with their menu if I bring new people in to explain everything to them without me having to do so. Their wait can be exorbitant like Hobak at times, but for the most part, this place is another awesome gem to try. They have great combos and a cute smores style dessert at the end of your meal. I feel like the portions they provide are a little more as well so you get a lot to share. Fantastic spot.",

    "text": "When I lived in LA, I would have Korean BBQ all the time, but I've lived in Vegas for over three years now, and I somehow haven't had ANY Korean BBQ that entire time. We recently decided we want to try as many restaurants in Chinatown as possible (something you'd think I would have made a goal long ago!) and after a gym session on an errand-filled day this past weekend we stopped in at Magal.  The first thing I told my BF when we decided to go was that I usually had KBBQ w/my Korean friends back in LA and that I speak and read exactly zero Korean, so I hoped that if we had any questions someone would be able to help us - and they totally were. I actually found it funny that I had made that comment to him once we got there and realized how helpful and friendly the server and host were.   We both ordered the beef combo as it seemed like the best value and simplest for us having been there for the first time (it was my BF's first time having KBBQ at all). The variety that came with the selection was perfect! We asked our server a lot of questions (Mickie) and she was so helpful and polite the entire time. When we were selecting drinks, I knew I had tried some Korean alcohols in the past but I couldn't remember what was what. Our server saw me Googling names from the menu and started explaining to me what everything was. Then she told us to come with her and walked us to where the drinks were and explained everything. It really felt just like being at a restaurant with a friend who's helping you decide and try whatever you want. Then of course I was asking about every little dish, some of which I've had before, but some I haven't, and she patiently explained all of those as well!  We ended up spending (I think) around two hours here and having a really great time. We even discussed coming back the next weekend because we really enjoyed the food and our time here. It was explained to use that Magal means pork skirt, which we didn't have in our combination, so we are definitely going to try that next time!",

Price: Expensive. The \"large\" beef combo for \"3-4 people\" was $95 and severely lacking in quantity. You WILL leave hungry-- I guarantee it. With tax and tip, our total came out to $120+ for 4 people without any drinks. For that price we got two handfuls of brisket, a plate of marinated ribs, 4 pieces of shrimp, 4 pieces of steak sashimi, and bulgogi.  Food: Mediocre. This place strives to be like Kang Hodong Baekjeong in Los Angeles except it's not. The meat was tough, the salad smelled bad, and the sauces were lacking.  Service: Awful. This is where it goes downhill. From the second the hostess heard we didn't have a reservation and her bad attitude to unfilled cups of water, missing food, slow refills, burnt meat because she wasn't attentive to the grill it went from bad to worse as the meal went on. We found ourselves making multiple requests for the same thing and getting dirty looks when we flipped the meat on the grill even though the server was not doing it for us.   Overall, not recommended. Skip.",

    "text": "We ordered the small beef combo for 3 people and added on 2 rice for lunch. I didn't think it would be enough but surprisingly it was. Towards the end, I thought we were done but there was still some meat left! The small beef combo comes with   3 pieces of boneless short rib 2 grilled prawns  2 pieces of pineapple and a few pieces of mushroom 4 pieces of boneless short rib sushi soybean paste soup with beef brisket skirtmeat  brisket 2 smores at the end of the meal  Besides from Hobak, I don't think I've ever had non AYCE kbbq. I'm from LA where AYCE kbbq joints are all over town but Magal is definitely a new favorite of mine. The quality and service is there, and you can leave without 1) smelling like you've been soaking in smoke and 2) content. The boneless short rib was definitely my favorite, it sort of just melted in my mouth! I passed on the prawns and soybean paste soup because I was too full but I did enjoy everything else. The short rib sushi is blow torched in front of you, which is pretty cool.  I wasn't too fond of the egg on the outside of the grill. Don't let it overcook, I felt like ours was and it wasn't very good. I think I would have preferred to order steamed egg in its own bowl separately. Side dishes were good, they tasted fresh AND, the kimchi wasn't super fermented which is how I like it! I enjoyed the refreshing soup they gave each person at the beginning as well. Its a chilled soup, and is a bit sour. However, I didn't like the almond like gelatin at the bottom of the soup.   At AYCE places, you cook your own meat so it was really weird to be having someone else cook our meat and cut it for us. But I like how they start off with brisket and then put on a new grill for the rest of the meat. I didn't like that the grill had holes so our garlic kept falling through the holes. If you want garlic, put it on with the brisket in the beginning!   I didn't try the smores at the end but my friends said that they would have preferred graham crackers instead of the rice crackers (?) that they offered.",

    "text": "Hubby and I stopped in one cold Saturday evening (after having driven past it the night before) and were seated after a short wait (we wanted a booth, not stools - we old/lazy, no more core strength!)  We were given a primo spot in the midst of all the fun and excitement of a trendy KBBQ place.  We ended up ordering the Beef Combo and then sat back to snack on the banchan they provided and distract ourselves until the main event happened.  I loved most of their banchan.  The salad with the creamy dressing was a little odd and I didn't much care for the flavor. The acorn jelly soup was my fave and I ended up eating mine and hubby's.  We weren't offered refills and I'm not usually shy about asking but I guess I just wanted to take measure of how this place operated and then got distracted by other stuff.  Also, I recommend their special tea (what you get when seated).  When asked, our server said they do not sell it. Bummer!  The food comes in a little tower and our server basically cooked everything for us.  The combo also came with a sushi thing drizzled with a gochujang-like sauce which was a-ok.  The meats were all definitely top-notch quality.  I wasn't too big on the marinated short rib flavor but the tenderness helped a lot.  Up until this point, service was on-point (with the exception of not offering refills on stuff).  Our guy was super attentive and accommodating. The tea refills were perfect temperature and he made sure our meat was cooked to our liking.   Then...he went on break and we got a girl who didn't seem as invested in her work, being that she spent most of her time walking around being freezing cold (I'd noticed her odd posture earlier in the evening, before she started helping us).  I asked for a refill of the tea and basically gulped down a small mouthful of scalding liquid which had to have just been boiling a few seconds before.  Thank goodness our meal was almost at an end because my taste buds were toast.    At this time, we asked for our check from the manager but he quickly told us there was dessert.  This was a pleasant surprise since I didn't see that being included on the menu.  So we got s'mores on Korean rice crackers.  Pretty delicious, if I should say so.  All in all, we enjoyed our meal at Magal. (Found out there's one in LA, too.  Cool!)",

    "text": "We tried this new Korean BBQ restaurant while we were in Vegas and we loved it!   We ordered the beef combo, cold buckwheat noodle, and the volcanic fried rice between the two of us (it is a lot of food but we wanted to try them all). When you go to a Korean restaurant, first thing I do is try all of the side dishes (usually side dishes come out first). From that, you can tell whether the food is going to be good. I really liked their \"mook\" soup, korean gelatin in cold broth. It sounds weird but it is very good. All of the side dishes tasted good and I had high expectations.   The beef combo came with several different kinds of specialty meat, meat nigiri (which they torch up in front of you), shrimp and vegetables. Every single meat was good quality and delicious, despite the fact that I had to eat everything well done . The cold buckwheat noodle was very good as well, it was a bit sweeter than I'd like it to be. The volcanic fried rice is a must try, it's very entertaining to watch how they prepare it.   Lastly, service was amazing, they came by right on time to cook everything perfect and nothing was burnt.   Magal is definitely a place I would like to return to! I'm drooling..",

Meat was flavorful. Beef sushi which is torched at bedside was delicious. Excellent service as well.  Overall great meal and would recommend to friends/family even strangers.",

    "text": "I'll start off by saying that I don't have high expectations for similar restaurants, just looking for good food and better customer service, which is hard to mess up in a city like Vegas that's built on both. This restaurant is new and they still need to figure out their steps of service. Waited 45 minutes for a table on a Tuesday. I understand if its busy, but when you have hungry guests in the queue looking at empty tables, they're obviously going to get frustrated which was what was happening with a lot of people waiting around me. I was in a party of 2 and still waited close to an hour with empty tables. The hostess was super young and didn't have the voice or presence to call parties to their ready tables or tell them they needed to wait longer. After finally getting seated, the table was already pre-set with side dishes which was great. The biggest complaint I have from my experience was the smoke - the ventilation was super weak and the way the air conditioning was set up made the smoke from the grill blow directly in my face. I told my server and she just laughed, thinking it was a joke. But I literally couldn't see or breathe half the time we were eating. The food was ok, nothing ground breaking.",

None of them holds a candle to this place. We got the beef combo for 4. The meats were so plentiful, and of very high quality; and most of all....DELICIOUS! The staff here cooks the meats at your table expertly. And it was all inclusive...all the incredible beef courses (plus prawns, and grilled pineapple), sides, rice, condiments, soups (plural!), a Korean iced tea with a subtle, bewitching flavor. The only thing we had to cook ourselves were the marshmellows for Asian S'mores, for dessert.  I had never been a fan of s'mores...until I had them with light-as-air rice wafers (in lieu of dusty-tasting graham crackers). This whimsical bite for dessert is sheer brilliance. The most reasonable Korean Bbq dinner we have ever had, and by far the best one. The friendly, efficient staff is the icing on the cake. We will be bringing everybody here...if you want to treat visitors to an epic dining experience, I urge you to do the same.",

The side dishes included kimchi salad and a bunch of other thing which were tasty.  We ordered the small beef combo which was more than enough for 3 people.  All the meats we of really good quality, especially if you compare it to some of the existing Korean bbq places around.  Each round of meat our server would come by and cook it for us.  This was a pleasant surprise since they knew exactly how long to cook.  I am looking forward to my next experience here.",

There is no seats or bar area for waiting customers. Since this restaurant has over 500 branches worldwide, it must be hard to maintain the quality of food or services.  We ordered the beef combo and they are just okay.  The food has so much sugar in it, the taste of all the dishes are sugary and could not taste the True beef flavor. I hope all the food could be less sugary. Other than that, torch baking Wagyu beef sushi was a great performance for the customers.  Friendly staffs and food presentation deserve five stars but the food taste could get two stars. I could get better taste of BBQ in some other places easily, so I would give three stars. Hopefully, the taste of beef or pork would improve over the years.",

Came here about 3 times during the trip because it was so good! Had one server who was our favorite, Andy, and he gave us the best service! We loved the soju and he would even make it special for us with added lemon since they ran out of the peach we usually got. If you come here you HAVE to drink some soju!! We ate with a group of 8 and we didn't have to wait too long to be seated although the place was packed each night, maybe about 25 minutes at most, but worth every minute. My favorite food choices were the egg that comes around the BBQ grill and the pork belly. Everything else on the BBQ menu was also delicious! We left in a very happy food coma! If I ever get to come back to Las Vegas I will definitely be coming here first!",

We went there thinking ayce Korean bbq but kinda freaked finding combo and not ayce. But the beef started coming out and more and more.. This was looking like a Korean bbq in thanksgiving dinner proportions. So after I got seated our server Sunny Park explained the deal and differences between this several hundred store international franchise chain that accounts for consistent quality and other AYCE Korean bbq and huts. The meat was all choice or prime and Sunny Park did most of the work flipping and shuffling food around the in table grill even taking the meat off the rib bones. All of the sides and sauces were so freakin' tasty and my personal favorite was the iced acorn soup. I know that sounds creepy but they pull off so much flavor out of a savory iced soup, I want to steal the recipe and I could have drunken a quart easy. They even paled the extra to go which isn't going to happen in an AYCE so I have Scooby snacks for later. Complimentary iced corn, cheesecake bites and service by Sunny was excellent. Try it once and I think you will be back. I sure will",

The only complaint I have is that the vent was not strong enough to keep the smoke out of my face and my hair. I like that the server was cooking for us in the beginning and all throughout our meal. I also like that he was explaining what all the meats were and he was asking how we wanted them cooked. In short, the service was excellent. They also serve this Tea instead of water, which I liked a lot. Instead of getting water or soda, you are refreshed with tea free of charge. I also got the soondubu which was OK. It didn't come to me sizzling, which I was disappointed about, because my egg inside of it was still very very raw by the time I ate the soup. Usually, when I go to other kbbq places, the soondubu is scalding hot and boiling when it gets to me. That's usually my favorite. Everything eDelicious nonetheless. I was so full and satisfied.",

So much taste. I'm guessing that's why it's not ayce. Place is clean. They offer this cold Korean soup as a side which is a first for me at Korean restaurants and it was yummy. Weird that it's cold but yummy. They also offer this taro tea as well. The grill is super small which is annoying. The salad is not the typical salad u get at Korean bbq places. Didn't like it. They do have a little area on the grill that cooks the egg and where your corn is placed but the egg was wack and took forever to cook and was difficult to even grab and so was the corn.",

The service was friendly, attentive, and speedy. We had brisket, pork belly (wrapped in grilled kimchi), the wagyu (?) beef sushi, and a marinated rib eye at the finish with steamed egg, bean sprouts, a salad with bean paste dressing, kimchi, some sort of acorn soup (that is how it was described to me and I was skeptical but it was damn delicious) and a cheesy corn mixture as sides. Korean BBQ would be nothing without a little soju and somac (which we had plenty of). We spent three hours eating, drinking, and chatting... enjoying the food, the atmosphere,  and each others company (which is why I understand why they asked if I had \"experienced\" Korean BBQ because it is a process). This is definitely a must visit and a restaurant I plan to return to soon!",

I was so happy to stumble upon this joint and look forward to becoming a regular.  Update:  This place was ideally good, the few times we came here. My family enjoyed the food and everything was good, expect maybe the steamed egg- I really don't care for kimchi mixed in, and I Opted for regular egg, it cooked strange and dried out fast, almost like when  you leave eggs on the stove and forget to turn the burners off- I've never seen any Korean bbq spots have this issue and it was quite disappointing. But my one star sadly has nothing to do with the egg experience  my bad experience is my most recent visit  We were looking to dine with our extended family and it brought our party to a whooping 7-  4 adults and 3 little ones- As I came in to check in and grab a table for 7- I was surprisingly encountered with a comment oh I told you we no have table for 7. I was thrown back because I did not inquire as I just walked in. second how do you not have a table for 7? The hostess prompted me to follow her as she helped tables and showed me two tables telling me this is all they had  I was little confused on why she was trying to break up our party? We came together to eat together and have a delightful dinner I told her no that would not work, and as I tried to ask for the empty private rooms that had table to accommodate our party. she just turned away without warning in the middle of our conversation and started to talk to a table who was eating.  Mind you they didn't ask her for help! She thought it would be fitting to ignore me mid sentence while I was talking to her (in the middle of the aisle) Oh man that was the icing on the cake! After she finished she tried to talk to me again- about splitting up my party- already fed up and upset on what just happened- I looked at her and said' oh are you done? Now you want to talk to me-  I gladly reminded her how rude and wrong  on what she did!  I told her you know what I am done,  I don't want to eat here anymore or talk to you. we will gladly take our business else where  and we did- we packed up and headed to Hobak- the food and service is way better! Based on what just happened- I don't plan on coming back to this rude and inconsiderate establishment, who doesn't care about a party sitting together.  Good luck with that Magal, it was nice knowing you! You might wanna train your staff to be a bit more friendly to non-Korean customers!",

My favorites were the rib eye, boneless short rib sushi that's blow-torched at your table, and kalbi. You get a good amount of sides - including soup and the standard banchan.   The servers cook the meat for you, which I usually am not the biggest fan of because sometimes it can be awkward. Our server though was so quick and efficient, it didn't feel weird at all.   Overall - thumbs up! If I had to choose between going to Magal or Gyu-Kaku, I'd def choose Magal.",

    "text": "So I visited two Korean bbq places one day apart and it was my first time at a Korean bbq. First of all, don't wear anything fancy, because little bits of grease will splatter on your clothes from the sizzling meat. Also, the meat isn't super tender, and they just give you chopsticks and a spoon. The food was ok. Nothing I would ever crave again. It was a place that they actually cooked the food for you. The sides are unlimited and very tasty. The drink menu is very limited. Friendly atmosphere",

The service here is super attentive and very quick. You get so many yummy side dishes, and the little touches such as free barley tea is delish. Dining here, you feel like opulent royalty at a feast with how generous they are. This is in my top 2 KBBQ in Vegas.",

But alas, third time is not the charm. The service was just too awful.  My boyfriend and I went on Monday night, and the place was pretty packed. (But I've also gone on Saturday night with no issues with service.) We were seated within a reasonable time frame. Banchan and tea were brought to our table relatively quickly. The waitress took our order.......and that was where it all went downhill. The employees typically cook your meat for you, but our waitress ended up being so awful that we ended up cooking the food for ourselves.  We had to ask for banchan refills twice. And water twice. And we even had to ask for rice--from the bus boy (who was super fast about it). Every time the waitress came over to flip over our meat, we had to ask for things. She would say ok, and then forget all about it. The other two times I was here, the waiter asked us if we wanted rice right away when the first meat dish was cooked. She totally forgot about it. C'mon, we're Asians. We need our rice.  She torched the beef sushi like she had a grudge against it--so it was really overcooked. For the other meat dishes, she kept insisting that our meat was ready, but it wasn't. I typically eat medium rare to rare meat, but her idea of \"ready\" was way too raw for me. She even laughed that the grill wasn't getting hot enough--and that the previous people at our table couldn't even eat the egg moat because it never cooked.  That's not cool. If the table isn't functioning properly, don't seat someone there. Fix the issue, then use the table.  Towards the end of the meal, we took things into our own hands and cooked the rest of the food by ourselves. Our waitress had the balls to cut up the pieces of pineapple we had cooking on the grill--after we had cooked everything else by ourselves. Honestly, I don't even remember her ever asking if we were doing okay.  I have no complaints about the food. The quality of their meat is great. (I want to say the wonky grill on the third visit contributed to the overcooked brisket, but that's a mechanical issue--not the food.) To be honest, I've only gotten the beef combo here because it's that good. Banchan is great as well.  I'm hesitant to come back to Magal because this last visit was just so awful. I typically don't call out the employee if I had a negative experience -- but I spoke to a friend who also experienced poor service here, and we seem to have gotten the same employee. So if you get an older, middle-aged Korean lady with glasses, I suggest running the other way.   5/5 for food 2/5 for service",

Everything is high quality, from food to service responsiveness. It ends up being about 5 dollars more than other ayce bbq places, so even though it's not ayce, you get full and the price ends up being comparable and the better quality is worth it.  Great job.",

    "text": "'Magal' is a relatively new Korean BBQ; it opened in 2016. Unlike the usual Korean BBQ restaurants I've been too, Magal isn't an AYCE place. You can order specific meats and Korean food and they each have their own prices for them. The prices are a bit high if you want to experience it, but they have a good quality meat.   If you want to share with a group they do offer two combos: Skirt Meat Combo and Pork Combo.  My friend and I ordered the Pork Combo. They cook the meat for you, and they'll bring out the meat at a time, sort of like a course meal. The various porks were so delicious!  Our waiter was very nice and recommended to eat the meat with ssamjang. Ssamjang is a common dipping sauce for meat. I'm always wary of anything that's red and Korean, because it's a high chance it'll be spicy; especially for me since I'm weak to spiciness.  I tried out the sauce with my meat, and it was really good! It surprised me since it wasn't spicy to me. I read online that ssamjang can also be made on the sweeter side, so maybe that's why I was able to enjoy the flavor~  They offer a good size selection of side dishes like salad, fish, kimchi, and Korean Vegetable pancake(Jeon). Around the rim there are two section to cook corn and half of the grill rim cooks egg.  The restaurant has a nice modern feel to it where you can have a nice time with good company and delicious food~ I really liked how they had metal chopsticks and the long metal spoons. I always enjoy Korean utensils, especially metal chopsticks since I feel like I have a better grip on my food~  Magal is a nice place for good quality food, even though the prices are a bit expensive, you can make a plan with a group a friends or so where you can probably split the cost if you are willing~ I want to go back to try out their cheese dip~",

But this time is horrible, our server, a Korean guy, and another female Korean lady had really bad attitude since we walked into the restaurant, threw all the plates, bowls and even hot soups on our table, in front of our parents. When we asked for four bowls to share our back rib soup, the server even pretended he did not hear and left. It is the first time in the US I felt so disrespectful and disappointed about dining service. But all other servers and the manager are nice. I talked to the manager and he switched another server to our table. However, I will never come back.  In the end, to your boss: You are not only doing business with Korean customers, you are serving customers from everywhere. These two servers merely hurt our feelings, but keeping them in your restaurant will harm your businesses. Please pay attention to train your employees.",

This place is not AYCE, but their combos for two are usually enough to fill us up. You can order a la carte as well.   The grill has corn around the edge, along with some egg mixture that eventually cooks as your meat is being cooked on the grill. It tastes good, but I assume it's often forgotten. The quality of meat is better than your average AYCE place.   Service this time around was great. It wasn't too busy around the evening time, and our server was cooking the meat and checking up on us in a very timely manner. The meat wasn't over cooked and we weren't forgotten!",

    "text": "Probably the best interior of all the Korean BBQ restaurants in town. It's modern and trendy with a touch of industrial elements. As soon as you walk through the door you and greeted. I've been here a few times, with the first time being for BBQ and the subsequent times for lunch specials.  It was my first time trying Heotkkae Berry tea. I love this! Quite similar to barley tea, but has a sweet undertone. It reminds me of taro tea, if there is ever such a thing. The kimchi was pretty good, slightly on the sweet side. The other side dishes were also good. All of the meats for BBQ look and taste fresh. There is something like a meat sushi where they use a torch to cook the meat on top of a ball of rice, right in front of you. So cool!  What I like about the grill is that there is a slot for the scrambled eggs and another slot for corn to cook. After the corn was eaten, I placed the fresh garlic in there to cook. I also liked how there is a rack beside the grill to place the cooked meats. By the way, they also cook everything for you so be sure to leave a nice tip! The BBQ portion of this restaurant is great.   My other visits were for lunch. They have several lunch specials. So far I tried the Volcano Fried Rice, the Stir Fried Pork in a bowl, and the traditional Korean Clear Broth Soup. The fried rice was good. It's essentially kimchi fried rice. They cook it for you over the grill; first they heat up the sauce, add the rice and other ingredients, then form it into a volcano shape (be careful as it will splatter and possibly stain your white shirt!). They then take a spoon to create the summit and then pour the scrambled egg over the top and around the volcano. As soon as it's done, they tell you not to mix it, but to just take spoonfuls of the egg and rice.  The Stir Fried Pork in a bowl was yummy! It's kind of soupy, so adding the white rice to the bowl is kind of a no-brainer. The Korean Clear Broth soup was also delicious. It's a non-spicy soup, so you should try this if spicy is not your thing.  The staff was prompt and friendly. Some of them don't speak English very well, so try to keep your requests short and simple. During my lunch visits, their machine for making the shaved ice dessert was unfortunately not working, but I'll try again next time! Oh, and to top it off, they bring out complimentary cheesecake bites with the check!",

I saw the price  for two and thought it was a bit pricy at $59. Since there were 4 of us we ordered bar b cue for two and three of us ordered another entrees such as: ramen, spicy kimchi stew and rice cake dish. The bar b cue came with miso stew. The miso and kimchi stew had wonderful flavor. They also gave us 4 different side dishes and cilantro salad was yummy! We got 5 different types of meat and were surprised and impressed that our server cooked the meat for us. At the end of our meal they also brought us shaved red bean ice which comes with bar b cue meal and since there were 4 of us they brought us a larger serving. Our bill was $110 including tip and we had lots of food and excellent service!!!!!",

After getting our meats, it seemed kind of a small serving for 3-4 people, considering the price tag is about $95.00. After getting the meats, out server cooked it on their special grill which I'm not sure were supposed to touch if they're cooking. I get they disappear to cook other people's meats too, but after a while of being gone my meat started to burn. I thought the purpose of this was to not cook your own meat?  well aside from that, meats were ok. The only meat I enjoyed was the marinated short rib and steak. I can deal without that sushi meat that they cook in front of you with a blow torch. It seemed more for show than actually tasting good lol. I did enjoy the volcano fried rice, it's actually one of the best kimchi fried rice I had freshly made.   Other than that, place is just average.",

We got the meat lover package for $100. This is the type of KBBQ restaurant where the server cooks all the meat for you and all you have to do is eat and tip him well.  All the meat is very good compared to the other KBBQ place, only thing which need to improve is they may want to stop playing loud banger EDM music. I myself love EDM but I am not tryna get turnt while I am trying to eat my dinner. Also I felt there's no AC inside. Holy fck grill is in front of us burning em meat and my sweat is flowing down like a waterfall. Can't they turn on AC or have a fan?  Overall, definitely do come and eat their meat because their meat is gooood.",

We waited about 15-20 mins to be seated, which wasn't bad. I really like the interior of the place. Very clean and modern, with a variety of spaces and rooms for seating. Probably one of the best-looking kbbq restaurants (if not the best) in town. For the five of us, we ordered a small beef combo and a small pork combo. All the side dishes pre-prepared on the table were great. Loved the kimchi, eggs, cheese & corn, and kimchi pancakes. The food came relatively quickly. However, as we started eating, the service was a bit slow. After we finished each type of meat off of the grill, we had to wait for the server to start cooking...taking longer for the meal than we preferred. At times the server wasn't paying attention to the meat he started cooking and some of it got burned a little. Other than that, the quality of the food and taste were great. Liked everything we ordered. Their menu is definitely more interesting to me than that of Hobak. I want to try everything here, and will definitely come back for their lunch special also.",

The egg didn't really cook all the way and burned in the middle. They Cook for you for the most part. The tea is not the normal barley tea, but it reminds me of taro? This place was just wayyyyyy to smokey. My face was so greasy after. And can I get a refill? Maybe the waitress heard my remark of them yelling, but she was accommodating to everyone else at my table except me, the one juggling a baby trying to eat. The quality of meet is just alright. The steak sushi thing was disgusting. I mean they torch it in front of you and you can taste the torch. It was weird and gross. You have to ask for rice too. The sides were just ok. Maybe it would have been a better experience if the music wasn't so loud and if the waitresses didn't yell on the top of their lungs every time someone walked in. Turn down the music and you won't have to yell.",

I absolutely recommend their cold noodles even if it's an addition to the abundance of yumminess you order. The cold noodles are made from bamboo in house & you can absolutely taste the difference in quality. I've been here twice and I always end up getting the beef combo EO he is more good than 3 people can uncomfortably eat. They have amazing lunch and dinner specials if you check in on Yelp just ask the server. Dabin & Sunny are the best",

Me and my girlfriends went to catch up at Magal BBQ, I ordered the beef combo for 4 - $95.99. Everything was delicious. My favorite was the boneless short rib and regular short rib.  I also ordered a order of the pork skin, it  wasn't bad but I wouldn't ordered it again. It was too rubbery, chewy and marinated too sweet.  The grill came with steamed egg and corn cheese on the sides which was a nice touch. And for dessert everyone got complimentary smores with rice crackers. We even got a few extras thrown in because we loved it so much. Will be back again!",

Pros: Someone is always cooking for you. They're always changing their grills. The meat quality is higher than the other restaurants. There's cheesecake at the end of the meal.  BUT there were so many different dishes here. As the dishes were brought out, we had no idea what they were. There was some sort of cold soup that had ice in it. I didn't care for their salad or their bean sprout mix either. Kim chee was the only regular side dish. The only thing I really liked was some sort of fried pancake thing and the corn that is on the side of the grill. Again, the lady would come and cook and you know she should tell us what we were eating, but she didn't. I don't know how everyone is, but I like to know what I'm eating so if I like it, I can order it next time.  I just wasn't impressed by this place. It's pricier also.

He tried to make excuses that the grill was temperamental and then tried to blame my son for kicking the gas line...this guy is a bigger idiot for not taking responsibility...then when he couldn't handle the confrontation, he asked us to leave...what a coward.

I guess they are trying to cater to the kpop culture fans. Meat quality was good and their soups and stews had very flavor depth. They know what they are doing. Price is similar to all the other KBBQs except the one across the street (that place is trash). Anyway, I would eat here again.",

    "text": "My husband and I chose to come here for lunch. I admit I was hesitant before we even walked in since I had looked at the menu and had seen the prices before hand but my husband thought they looked good and they were close. Let me also note that we were 1 of 3 tables dining and they were not very busy.   We were greeted and sat immediately which was nice. They got drinks going right away as well. Since we had never been to this restaurant I wanted some time to look over the options but felt rushed by the server so we ended up getting the skirt meat combo which came with a variety of beef and pork. We also ordered chadol. They brought out some cold jelly soup and two salads which were ok. One salad tastes like kimchi with lettuce and the other had a slight peanut flavor.  We pulled out chopsticks and spoon out as they were setting up our grill and the server mildly scolded us for setting them down on our napkins (they are suppose to be placed on the parchment they come in) so that was a little off putting since I've never been anywhere that did that I didn't know.   The chadol was placed on the grill first and the server would come back and serve it to us. Chadol is one of my faves and theirs is good. They did a grill change before the next meat which was a beef skirt strips. I was confused as the first meat they cooked and served us but the second one no one came back so I finally turned it and served us. The third meat which was pork was placed by the server who told us she'd be serving us. With that said the pork burned and I mean it was burned I started to move it and the server snatched the tongs from me like she was upset I tried to move it but realized she had not come back soon enough. She didn't even apologize. She brought back a few pieces of pork to try again but no where near what would have been included in our combo. So I felt like I really didn't get what I paid for  The last thing and it's probably silly but the server explained the menu to my husband and not to me. What I mean is she stood on his side of the booth and leaned in and explained it to him. With the fan on I could hardly here what she was saying nor did she make eye contact with me like she was talking to both of us. It seemed odd and then my husband had to explain what she said.   Pros: quick seating, chadol was good and beef was tender. Husband enjoy what little of the pork we got.   Cons: not clear on the etiquette(utensils and cooking), took way to long to attend to food, seriously over priced for the service given.   Over all it would not be my first pick for Korean bbq. What we did eat was good but there are better places in the area for Korean bqq that are worth the money.",

The pork belly is a must, the brisket is my fave of all the BBQ places I've tried in town. I'm sold on the Heotkkae berry tea too - refreshing and detoxing. It tastes like water sweetened with the syrup in a boba jar! They're open until 3a so this would be the perfect 4th meal after a night out. They have lunch specials too...I will DEFINITELY be back!

Thank you for the glowing white Neon lights or else we wouldn't have stopped.    First thing you notice is that it's pretty darn clean for a BBQ joint and it was packed for a week day.  That's always a good sign.  Cutting it short. Everything from service to quality of meats, and banchan was TOP GRADE and  flavorful.  Most places don't even give you bean soup anymore or really stingy w/ the banchan.    The waiter made it clear that he was cooking the meat for us and all we had to do was enjoy and that we did!  And a shave ice dessert to end it all.  We will most definitely be coming back here on our next trip to Vegas!  Thanks TOMMY for an amazing meal and service!",

It's like a \"fine\" dining k-bbq that you kinda not see all the time by the area where it's established. 5stars for it.   Parking Lot: Its not a struggle! very spacious and great location actually.   Guest Service: Our server is just awesome (look for young! lol) Very accommodating with all of my questions (with all of the food that's \"unfamiliar\" with my tastebuds and my sights ). For that i'm giving 5 stars. Keep it up Young!   Food: All was superb. Served fresh and the meats are all that good of a size compare if we u to the common ones that of course we all love. What i just didn't liked was the salad with the seeds on it \"but\" it's good though it's just not a favorite and the pickled bokchoy and celery  (sorry) and last the cold soup... it just doesn't catch my tastebuds though. I was hoping for the skirt steak but unfortunately their out. *bummer*   Spoiler: If you love Korean Novelas and you want to try the Spicy Rice cake... Their spice rice cake is a must!    So for food, i gave them 4stars! More room for improvement.   Lastly, Price: Their combo's are actually pretty decent and reasonable but if you want a mix beef and meat, then you gonna pay per plate of beef and pork. So for that being said, 4stars as well.   Improvements: The Fire on the Pit. It's waaaaay too high. (please do fix it, i'm concerned on the hands of your servers. It's just scary! ) Also, it seems your extinguisher doesn't work much. Yup! so hopefully, its way better next time on our next visit. I gave it a 4stars for room for improv",

Tried the beef combo, lunch specials and the volcano fried rice. Why?  - Food was good.  - Excellent portions with tons of side dishes.  - They'll replace the sides if you ask.  - Service was on point. From the greeting to cooking the meats and fried rice at the table.  - Prices were reasonable.   - Ample parking space. - TVs everywhere.  - Kid friendly. Yes, I was in Vegas w/ a 3 year old.  Just to be a bit objective and prepare those who are K-BBQ virgins, here are some distractions.  - This is not AYCE.  - There will be times when the music will be blasting fast, K-pop music.  - ALL servers will appear like they're serving ALL the tables communicating on their walkies and \"streamlining\" the service.  - Just because they're speeding around doesn't mean you have to.  Sit down and enjoy the food.   Last bit of advise: - Drink the tea (hot or cold) - Get the shaved ice dessert.",

If you are here expecting ayce, go back to the strip and go to a buffet.  Quality does reign supreme here and quantity comes at a close second.    Immediately when you sit, you get the Korean soju house creamed corn, and an egg dish that cooks as you eat.  I did the gogi combo and I was a bit hesitant that this little tea sandwich contraption was going to fill me up but I am seriously about to give birth to an 8lb baby because I am so full.   If you make it to the end, get ready to have a server make the fried rice with egg dish.  Not too sure what it is? I'm not going to explain so you can order it and fall into the line of regretting of eating too much.    This place is good and the quality of the meat really shows.    5/5",

Good manager not just supervise but also do everything he can to make up the mistake. As for the food, meat quality is good, marbled short rib melt in mouth.

Every single dish is so delicious. It's similar yet so different in a refreshing way.   This place is also the first place I known that give soup as part of the appetizers. All the appetizers are really well made even though it's free.   The house salad is perfect to have with the meal. No matter how delicious a grilled food, i always need some kind of vegetables to balance my diet. But their house salad is so good that I might even order that as a takeout for future lunch diet.   The way the grill setup is very unique. There is a well on the left half side for an omelette. And right half side is reserved for the cooked meat. The server grill all the food from start to the end. Two or three server take turn making sure my meat is not burn. I don't have to touch the grill tongs once!  I hope my fabulous dining experience here is not a fluke. I will be back to make sure that this restaurant stays as my favorite korean restaurant in town.",

The portions were generous too.  I loved that we had both cold soup & hot soup. OH! And the barley tea!!!! Such a big deal for me because I haven't had that since I was a little girl when my mom used to make it so it was like going down memory lane each sip   The only thing I would change is the pace of the servers cooking the food. I think it should be slowed down a few notches just so my belly can digest the food before the next round... but that minor detail was lack of communication on my part. Also, some of the meats could have more flavor to differentiate a little more from each other.   Other than that, the service here was great from the time we walked in the door, with warm greetings, our cups kept full, tending to our grill, and left with full tummies! (David is a great server! )  Overall, great experience!",

There was no time where I felt like we were running out of anything or we had extra plates or trash that needed to be removed from our table because the servers were always there seamlessly to take care of everything and anything.   In regards to the food, the servers cook the food for you in your personal grill. They cooked the food to perfection. The food here is not served to you buffet style, therefore the quality of the food is excellent. You do not feel heavy when you walk out. We had rib eye steak, a thinner steak and the short ribs and they were amazing! As part of the condiments, the servers brought out kimchee, rice, egg with kimchee, this corn pasta thing and salads. This place is a must try!",

It also didn't come with rice which was weird.The meats was good but it wasn't anything special from other kbbq places I've had. The side dishes weren't good and I didn't like the melting cheese that they had either. I really liked the hangover tea that they served though. And I liked how they had hot corn and egg which other places don't have!",

We walked in and decided to get the Magal Combo for somewhere around $94.99. I forgot the actual price. Might have been $99.99.  Any way, we were given so much food. Like a lot of KBBQ places, they give you all the banchan(side dishes) you want. The thing about this place is that the waitress helps you BBQ the food. I'm not sure if it is customary for all KBBQs in the states to cook the food for you but I'm used to just being given the meat myself and having to cook it myself.  It came with short ribs, pork belly, ribeye and squid. Pretty amazing price for that much food. Everything was juicy but I think I'd be fine without the squid.",

    "text": "If you have a baby who needs to sit in a high chair, AVOID THIS PLACE!  After we have ordered our food and when the meat arrived, the waitress told us not to touch the meat being cooked since she has to do it. But because the high chair has to be located in the walkway, we had to keep moving our baby away to make room for her.   To avoid this continuous back and forth movement of the high chair, I placed my son on my lap. Then, the next thing happened: hot boiling soup bowl placed right in front of my son and I. And the guy just walks away as if it is alright to place something boiling in reach of a baby. Of course we quickly moved the bowl as far as we can from my son.   Next up was the blow torch to sear the meat. The plate that was used to sear the meat was placed in front of my son and I. The waitress blasts away with the flame toward my son and I. I told her immediately to stop and to do it some place else because the torch show wasn't worth getting a severe burn on either of us.   Finally, the metal oil container that was located inside the ventilator caused the last issue. The container was located right above myself and it suddenly dropped to our plates. Luckily nothing was inside the container and no one got hurt. But if that metal container was full of whatever it was supposed to contain, some of us could have been seriously injured.   I asked for the manager on site to address these issues and the guy who placed the hot bowl in front of us comes and says he is the manager. The guy told us 20% discount has been applied for the \"inconvenience\" that happened during our visit, as if money takes care of everything.   Thank you for ruining my mother's birthday luncheon.  Never going back again.",

One thing led to another, and we asked him for his recommendation for the best KBBQ joint in Vegas. He said MAGAL.  He expressed how hard it is to find authentic BBQ in America, but how this place does it really well (and at a super reasonable price). We were sold.  We walked in to a clean environment with friendly staff. We chose the MAGAL combo and the food appeared almost instantly. Seriously freaky fast.  At this particular KBBQ restaurant, they cook the food for you. All you have to do is sit back, relax, and enjoy the delicious food. After the first few dishes, we knew we would be coming back ASAP.  And the portions are perfect. We ordered a combo for two and were fighting to finish every delicious KBBQ bite. I'd be very surprised if you left this place hungry.  This place's food is amazing, the staff are friendly, environment is clean & modern, &... I am struggling to find anything negative about this place.   I just hope this chain grows & grows so one will pop up closer to my hometown soon.",

I ended up having leftovers for another dinner after getting it with one other person. I'd say the meat is better than the AYCE places, though overall I would say Hobak is slightly better. The meats did get progressively better, and none of them were bad. The little egg side slot unfortunately basically stumped us until the eggs were already a bit overcooked. I prefer a regular side of steamed egg over that. The sides were not quite as good as Hobak, but enjoyable enough. Service was good.",

Server cooked the meat on very low heat, so it didn't develop a nice char.  Didn't care for the beef sushi, torched table-side. Gimmicky and pointless, since you have a perfectly good grill right there. The sides were just meh, and so was the service.

Unfortunately, the restaurant was on the busier end (5pm) so our server ended up burning a lot of our meat/ over cooking it because he forgot to check on it. Which is fine when we're meant to grill our own food- but our server told us we should trust him to cook it. We did-- I regretted it.  I'm Korean so I've eaten all kind of KBBQ. At the price we were paying-- I was definitely expecting more. Portion sizes were on the smaller end, which is fine. I understand we're not at AYCE. But 3 slabs of over cooked pork belly for $26? Not too stoked about that.   In terms of the quality of the meat though-- it was pretty good! I've been spoiled since I just got back from Seoul and LA. Compared to those places, LV Magal was still acceptable. Again- just wish the server cooked the meat better!  Haha-- actually, there is a Magal in LA and my experience there was bomb. They really have a handle on the grilling and the meat quality is better Better service, better quality food. So interesting how two restaurants of the same chain can be pretty different.  In LA- Quarters is also really good! And if you're looking for a premium all you can eat experience check out Mr. BBQ in Fullerton. Those are my favorites.  Back to the meats here though-- my favorite meats here were definitely the beef short rib (not marinated) and the beef skirt meat.   Maybe Magal LV was just having an off day. Good luck.",

While flipping through the menu I ended up finding the chicken on the menu... hmmmm... ordered that and soondubu (tofu soup). The soondubu was NOT soondubu.. it was basically just soup with tofu in it :( My boyfie and I were super disappointed. DO NOT order this thinking it's traditional tofu soup!!!   As for the chicken, it was really good, but it just took an eternity to cook. We didn't start eating it until maybe OVER 30 mins after it was on the grill. Not the restaurants fault. The side dishes were lacking and there wasn't much variety. They were also MEH.   Not a very authentic spot for Korean food. I'll stick with Si Jang down the street.",

I quickly found that restaurants on the Strip that take reservations are expensive and want to hold our credit card. Thinking outside of the box, I suggested Magal BBQ to the group and it was a huge hit.  We were set up in the back group room, which accommodates up to 24 in six tables of 4. One experienced server was dedicated to our room and she did a fantastic job accommodating all of our needs. We decided to simplify our payment by having each table of 4 order and pay amongst themselves. My table of 4 ordered the large Magal combo which came with many types of beef, pork, veggies, and even squid at the end. We also got a couple of bottles of soju to share. Three big guys and I had plenty of food to go around.   Our server was super pleasant and was very aware of the dietary (no beef) restriction of one of the diners at an adjacent table. She cooked the one cut of beef in their order first, then switched grill-tops and tongs thereafter to ensure that nothing else touched beef. It was very thoughtful of her.  She also offered us dessert (yummy shaved ice) if a few of us checked-in on Yelp, which we didn't hesitate to do. Since our group had quite a few December birthdays to celebrate as well, we also brought our own cake. Unlike some other places, Magal was happy to let us bring our own and helped make sure everyone had plates and utensils to enjoy the cake.   My table of 4 rounded up our tip and the total of this great meal was $40 per person.",

I don't take photos because my friends and I eat all of them in 10 minutes. The waiters are attentive and cooked the meat for us. I can only do my job \"Meat eater\" with their perfect service. Nice experience here.",

    "text": "Decent and very nice staffed Korean BBQ place where they cook and cut the meat for you. The sides were pretty standard Korean side dishes except the mash potatoes was a surprising pumpkin mash. Very nice.   We got the beef package for 4 people because there was 4 of us and we couldn't finish it lol. But it was pretty good. However, their smoke ventilation doesn't do that great of a job. At other kbbq places I've been to, they have adjustable ones that go right up the meat so you're not bothered by the smoke. It was pretty bad. My poor cousin was directly in the smoke's path like standing behind the grill when   someone is bbqing on the beach. The package includes pineapple and mushrooms which was very exciting. I could eat grilled pineapple all day.  The disappointing part was the scrambled egg and corn. Other places I've been to had corn cheese but this place was just regular corn. Scrambled eggs was whatever.   Despite their busy-ness, the wait was only like 20 minutes on a Saturday at 7pm.   Overall, a pretty standard staff cooks your meat place, but I wouldn't really recommend unless you wanna die from smoke inhalation.  FREE SHAVED ICE WITH YELP CHECK IN AYYYYY. It was very fluffy with some red bean sauce and peanut powder.",

    "text": "We came in for lunch at opening to find they weren't ready to open but they let us in anyway.  They seemed a bit preoccupied because they weren't ready which was okay with us as we were talking and catching up.  One of the things that turned me off about it was that they tried to get us started but kept walking away and we ended up with burnt and raw egg bubbling onto the table.  We ordered the beef combo for 2 and it actually turned out to be a lot of food for 2 people.  I truly believe that 4 of us could have had it and been perfectly content.  I didn't realize that the last meat we would get was squid though and I thought that was kind of weird.  I mean I like squid but I ordered the beef combo.  Also, the \"sushi\" they serve was just not good.  Flavorless and covered in what tasted like watered down A1.  Not good.  The quality of the meats and marinades are what keeps this rating at a 3 and not a 2.  There were only 2 instances in which we got gristle and fat so for the price we were paying, it was well worth it.  The banchan were ok.  They weren't the best salads I've ever had and were a little lackluster but they were plentiful and not bad tasting.  I will gripe about them cooking the meats for us.  I usually like to go to AYCE because I don't want to be forced to eat something in a particular order but I understand this version and coming here I knew what I was getting myself into.  The problem I had was they were understaffed and didn't come around often enough. And when we would try to do it ourselves, someone would come by and kind of rudely take over.  I've been to other places and know that it can be done well so this was slightly irritating.",

I waited in thefront for someone to sit me and servers and bussers were just looking at me and passing by and nothing then finally a server sat me with no menu. The busser actually saw me and noticed I had no menu. Then when I ordered everything went down hill from there. The servers only care if you come in a big group and will ignore anyone else. I was hungry and just got out of work to enjoy some soup. When the food came out the runner put it on an empty table and the server once she did about 5 rounds she finally came and dropped off my food and that was the last time she came to me. I raised my had hoping she noticed me so I can get a salt shaker and she saw me twice but never came. Then a busser came and asked if I needed something and I told him salt and pepper. Took a minute but he got it for me.     The worst experience of customer service that I have encountered. You see the other 3 servers checking everyone , refilling drinks, and asking questions but if you are not in a group they wont attend to you. I asked for my bill and the waitress in my section never came and finally another waitress gave me my check because I asked her. This place needs to understand that customer service is important and they need to train all their servers better on that",

Evidently Magal is an international joint from Korea and has many branches in Singapore, Hong Kong, China, NY and LA.  Also, they are the first to use the egg well incorporated into their grill.  Supposedly, one will be opened up in SJ too but not sure when.  The difference between Magal and other K-BBQ is that the server will cook for you instead of DIY.  The problem is our waitress was serving four tables at the same time and busy going back and forth cooking for everyone.  Couple times our meat was on the verge of burning so I tried to move the meat aside but the waitress didn't like us doing that.  Perhaps she might get scolded by the restaurant for letting the customers work.  Not sure.  The combo probably is the way to go, although they are not cheap.  When the waitress brought out the tray, quantity seem to be on the small size, but it is more than enough for two.  Best to order the combo first then add on later if not enough.  Good quality meat for what you pay for.  Overall it's a pleasant experience.  Can't wait to have one in the Bay Area too.",

We ordered the beef combo. Meat was very tender but the taste was so so. They all kind of tasted the same. The side dishes were alright.   The service was so rushed that I think my husband had indigestion. We wanted to cook our meat a little longer but the waitress kept coming back and removing it from the grill and said it's good. So we finally said something and she mumbled in Korean.   We were going to order dessert but they had none even if it was in the menu. We wanted the bingsu, but they said not available.   I'd rather go back to Hobak, service there was much better and friendlier. Not to mention the meat!",

    "text": "First time we came here my girlfriend and I were looking for a KBBQ spot that didn't have a long wait time. Ended up checking this place out and OH MAN was this a great decision!   When it comes to Korean BBQ I typically check for 3 things:   -how good is their brisket -do they have good brisket sauce aka ponzu sauce  -is it all you can eat   Magal has 2 of the 3. Unfortunately you won't find an all you can eat service here. Typically if you don't, you usually find that the meat quality is a lot better. So don't let that stop you from coming here.   My girlfriend and I ended up getting the Small Beef Combo, which comes with an assortment of meats. I was a bit hesitant getting this because I felt like these combo plates don't fill me up. Man, was I wrong! The Beef Combo had just enough meat that it made my girlfriend and I pretty full. The meat quality was amazing! Every time I took a bite out of the meat after dipping in on their amazing house ponzu sauce was incredible! I only wished there was more brisket on the plate just because I can eat Korean brisket all day! Perhaps it would be great if we can sub out one of the meats out for more brisket?   The environment there is great! It's nice and clean with plenty of room for you and your friends. They also have a party room in the back where you can have huge parties to enjoy some great quality food.   The service there is amazing! Friendly staff who takes their time cooking for you and even sparking up a conversation or two. One of the serves Young is one of their best! I was surprised when he still remembered my girlfriend and I when we stopped by the second time. He made us feel welcome and very helpful when we needed assistance or any questions we may have. Even though I feel we don't need to, the servers there will stop by and cook your food for you. You can choose if you want to or not but I feel like with them cooking, they'll always 1) make sure your food is cooked properly and 2) always checking in to make sure you guys are alright. Imo, ask for Young when you come by. Man deserves a raise!   Overall, I had an amazing experience here! I said I would definitely come back and I already did. And I will be visiting again. This place easily became my favorite Kbbq spot here in Vegas!",

    "text": "I haven't been to many Korean BBQ places in the US, so I don't have a backlog of American style KBBQ to fall back on, but I've been to quite a few BBQ places in South Korea and with that in mind, this place was GOOD.  That said, this is not a US style place.  If you're expecting an American experience, don't look here.  There will be raw egg cooking at your table and the server will be handling your food and cooking it.  Neither of these things are unusual in Korea, where the server often cooks for you, and raw food shows up in lots of different forms to be cooked at your table.  You'll probably also have to ask for things (more to drink, more sauce, etc.), it won't necessarily be replenished without asking.  There's even a button on your table to get prompt service, which is just like all the restaurants I've been to in SK.  Don't hesitate to push it (it's not rude) and ask for what you need instead of waiting for someone to notice, because you might be forgotten.  The samgyupsal (pork belly) is incredible.  We also got the beef combo and everything in it was *outstanding*.  I looove doenjang chigae (fermented soybean paste soup) and it was amazing.  The banchan was all to die for except that the kimchi was a bit young for my taste (I like it old and ripe!), but that would be my only complaint.  They even had the green onion salad with gochujang that I haven't had since I was in Korea.  The Cass beer and soju were both delicious as well.  Overall, if you're looking for a very authentic experience without a lot of concern for American sensibilities (we were the only white people there), check this place out.  If you're going to be weirded out by hot tea in plastic cups and raw egg cooking at your table, this place isn't for you!  But do go and try it out.  My god, it was incredible.  I haven't had Korean food this authentic since actually being in Korea.  It was just so, so good.  I can't say enough good things about it.",

Let me start by saying the quality of meat at this place is excellent. A large beef course was able to feed my whole table and we were 5 adults. You walk out here feeling satisfied but not overly bloated like I usually do after having ayce. Great atmosphere and great service. I love the egg and cheese corn that heats up next to the grill. Also, it's nice not having to cook your own food, I rather just eat. Food is delicious. Will definitely come back.",

    "text": "\"So pork skin in special sauce and marinated pork entrails.  What else?\"  I begin while reading the online menu.  \"What's a hagfish?  Heck, we gotta get one of those, and how do they make a chicken foot boneless?   We have to try it\"  continues my Asian poker bud.  \"Oh come on guys\" whines Midwest poker bud.  Magal, the newest, authentic KBBQ chain to enter the Vegas food scene by way of Korea through China, and Southeast Asia.  Authentic flavors, yes.  Expansive menu with more than just KBBQ, yes.  Distracting environment.   Loud K-Pop music videos showing on the monitors, servers dressed in tropical uniforms and straw hats, and an over the top branded decor reminiscent of Josie and the Pussycats.  The food however, is solid.  Tip:  ala carte beef and pork plates are large (one per person if planning to share).  Combo's offer the greatest variety at the best value.  All include veg for grilling and soup.  About the beef, like most KBBQ joints, PRIME equals good quality and NOT USDA Prime grade.  That said, the \"PRIME\" beef is plenty tender with good marbling.  Typical sweetened soy marinade.  Tasty.  Skirt, and shortrib cuts top the list.  The weak point, the thin sliced brisket end point.  Shaved from frozen into rolls and cooked as a roll, there's just not enough in the bite to release flavor.  Pork is their forte.  Belly, neck, sweet soy marinated pork collar and spicy marinated \"skirt\" (have no clue what this cut is) all have lots of internal fat that cooks up sweet and crisp.  Pork skin and entrails are on the menu as well.  We passed.  Gas cook tops.  Grills are changed as needed.  Hoods are good but not great so expect  eu de KBBQ when you leave.  Service is good.  They will offer to cook for you.  Unless you want all your proteins cooked well done, insist on cooking for yourself.  If they refuse to relinquish cooking, just reach in and pull your meats from the grill when you want.  Watch out LA, Vegas is stepping up its game.",

Ma gal is short for small town sea gull in Korean so they include pineapple and shrimp to all BBQ courses. We ordered the beef course which included our waiter to use a torch to flambe meat sushi. The meat quality is on par with their  competition down the street. Our waiter, named Young, was cute and funny. Request for him if you go. I had him drink with us since he was so affable, attentive and entertaining. Just make sure to tell the hostesses that you are not doing BBQ if you just want to order off the menu instead of opting for the BBQ courses (which are a way better deal).  Overall this is a one of the few places in Vegas that offer korean food similar in quality to the Korean restaurants in LA.",

    "text": "Came in for dinner last night with husband and daughter, and first impression was clean, hip restaurant, not too smoky for a KBBQ. Greeted by friendly staffand seated in a booth right away.  Pros:   great value! We ordered the Magal combo for 2, and were barely able to finish it with 3 people.  Special kudos for the kalbi and for the spicy squid.  Total bill came to $64 before tip (we didnt have any alcohol), which for 3 people was awesome.  Lots of different sides, including 3 different types of salads, and various banchan inclthe usual kimchi, and several more.  Extremely attentive staff! Great service!  Cons:    Most meats weren't marinated. We would have enjoyed a more typical kbbq experience with bulgogi, spicy pork and such.  Banchan didn't include some of my faves like fish cake and kimchi was not spicy or fermented.  Severs wouldnt let us grill ourselves, even though we asked them to.  They said sure, then kept coming back to fuss with the foodon the grill.  For us, part of the kbbq experience is doing the grilling ourselves.  Overall: positive experience, but next time we'll look for a place that does more types of marinated meats on a combo menu.",

    "text": "Best Korean BBQ experience. The waitress knew exactly what to do every time she came to our desk, and we just enjoyed the grill.  The timing of when to finish grilling the meat always confuses me, but at here, they did all the grill for us. Many KBBQ places say that they do the grill for the customers, but unfortunately I've not seen one except this place. Recommended if you are like us who don't know when the beef/pork would be ready on the grill lol! Also, ordering was simple, there is no menu with 10 pages, but just a couple combo options and single items in case you need more. We two ordered the skirt meat combo and we are completely satisfied with the variety of the dishes in the combo.",

Rib eye slices, pork belly, steak, sushi steak rolls(4peice), beef rib. Portion size not enough for the price of $64.00 after tax. Wish there was more beef rib and meat period. Beef rib was only pretty much one piece and they sliced the meat off to make 3 piece. The marination of the meat was very bland. Could be better. Side dishes were very good. The Kimchi was spicy which I loved! Love the grill how the had the egg and corn cooking on the side of grill. Makes it a little unique. One thing I would say is this place is not all u can eat meat like the others I been to before so just don't come on empty stomach.",

When I was looking for the place it was hard to see the signage but as soon as I saw my co-workers I was in the right place.  As soon we stepped in  we were directed in the private dining area. Cute little set up where we had TVs and ladies you were able to put your bags and jackets inside your seat which are little barrels. How convenient and creative! Just don't forget your belongings!  Our Coworker just ordered for us and everything was amazing! BTW we did not have to cook our meats. Our waiter did that for us which was very convenient  and did not have to worry about our bbq being burned. Service was on point and accommodating.   To be honest with I had too many Sojus and Korean beer to drink. As long you are with Great Company and great Korean BBQ its always a great time.",

The ambiance is modern, casual and clean. Service was awesome!   I went with my parents so the 3 of us ordered the largest meat combination for $104. We couldn't believe how many different meats and other sides came with this combo. I would suggest getting the smaller meat combo if it's just 2-3 people in your party because we couldn't breathe after eating almost everything. Some of the sides included bean sprout salad, toss salad, pickled daikon (radish), shiitake mushrooms, onion salad and potato salad. The combo came with 4 types of beef, seared beef nigiri, spicy ika (squid), mushrooms, tofu chige, corn salad with melted cheese, egg scramble, pineapple and shave ice for dessert. So worth it right?! My parents frequent Las Vegas like it's their second home so they will be back! Heck, I will be too! Thanks Magal BBQ!",

It was around 6:15 - the parking lot was empty and I was thinking, \"oh geez - is this going to be one of those overrated/overhyped places?\" and boy was I wrong.  First of all, the meat combos here are awesome. We did a two person combo for the 3 of us and it was more than enough. We had brisket, spicy squid, short ribs, pork jowl, and marinated short ribs. I loved the rim of cheese corn and the kimchi egg. My parents were big fans too. Definitely reminded me of KHD in LA.  The combo was extremely reasonably priced and competitive with other non-AYCE places in LV. The service was also great and I give them extra kudos for being extremely efficient.  Overall, I think this is a great non-AYCE KBBQ place in LV. My parents who are born & raised in Korea absolutely love it and it will definitely be one of the restaurants we throw into the routine. Plus - my mom loves that they give patbingsu as your dessert (they keep it simple with condensed milk and red bean - super yummy). Definitely give this place a shot.",

    "text": "My first time trying Korean BBQ was a success! Let me start off by saying the only reason they are getting 4 stars, and not 5 is due to the service! The food was perfect!  Not too hard to find in china town,  with a huge parking lot! I took my 10 month daughter, no issues Magal was very kid friendly. I kept her in her stroller most of the time, due to the grill. As far as the decor it's very modern, spacious, and as far as I can tell clean!   The service could  have  been better, maybe they were short staffed. Upon walking in no one greeted us, and it was pretty warm inside. It for sure wouldn't hurt to lower the AC a bit being that it's 110 degrees outside. Finally I was able to flag  someone down to seat us . Our booth was cozy and private. Once again we were seated without menus and after waiting a bit I had to flag a server down. After that it was pretty smooth.   We went with the beef Combo for two, which was a little over 60$, totally worth it, the amount of food is well over that! The side dishes were very good. My favorites were the scallion salad, the kimchi which in the past I've never liked. There's happened to be very fresh, which made it taste amazing. I also really enjoyed the soup, fresh veggies some tofu and beef. Just the correct level of spice. We also got some rice and another salad.  The dipping sauce for the beef was very good as well too, sweet but tangy.  They waitress made sure she came back around to explain the process, flip our beef, and change the grills. Certain meats require different grille tops.   Lastly we got a shaved ice desert, I didn't get a chance  to taste, because I was so stuffed, but my niece loved it! So much food, well worth the calories might I add. The flavor was all on point.   If your looking for great Korean bbq in town, this is the place to go. Thanks to my girlfriend for taking me!",

    "text": "This place was the bomb!  We stumbled onto this place looking for something to eat before HH at the Tiki Bar across the street on Thanksgiving day.  It is small, but it was very clean and the hostess seated us right away.  We were the only non Asians in the place when we arrived. A good sign in my opinion when eating at an Asian restaurant.    The server came over and asked if we were familiar with Korean BBQ.  We assured her we knew what we were doing.  The menu was really large.  With so many choices, we could not decide on what to get, so we ordered on of the combo dinners for 2.  Our table was immediately filled with sauces and sides and the grill turned on.  After a few minutes the meat came out and our server put some on the grill for us.  Our table was completely full of plates to try!! Our server did do most of the cooking, but we did not mind.  We were so busy eating we might have burned the meats if she had not kept watch for us. The service was great and the food was fantastic. There was not a dish we did not like.  We even had two boxes of leftovers to take with us.  Best Korean BBQ we have had in the States.  It was better than one we went to in Bangkok as well.   Definitely coming back here next time we go to Chinatown in Vegas!",

Our server, I believe her name was Sunny P based on our receipt, was fantastic. She was knowledgeable and understood what we wanted to order. I went to Hobak the last time I was in Vegas, and the server didn't know anything about the menu or the answers to our questions. We enjoyed the marinated galbi, spicy pork skirtmeat and soybean stew. Their complimentary heotkkae berry tea is delicious. Also they don't play their music crazy loud or anything. I didn't realize this was something that bothered me until I went to an AYCE that played super loud techno music.   Can't wait to come back. I will definitely bring my parents here.",

I loved the hot Heotkkae berry tea. Been told it's an herbal tea great for hangovers and digestive issues.  12/6- Came for dinner. The young wait staff was horrible. I was the only customer and I received zero service and one of the young men made a smart ass remark when I left. There a zillion different Korean and/or Asian restaurants in Korean/Chinatown that I don't have to tolerate lil punk turds and nonexistent service.",

It was my first time to a Korean Barbeque so I wasn't prepared to grill our food at the table. We didn't want to cook our food and smell like smoke, so the waitress did it for us on the next empty table.  The lunch waitress was very accommodating but I noticed while she was helping the table near us she was leaning over and talking over another customers food for a good amount of time. Call me a 'germaphobic' but I prefer not to have someone else talk or breathe over my food. Aside from that I would recommend the place for dinner with family or friends.",

Very thankful I was able to come across this place right around the corner from where I live. I was super drawn in by the pictures of corn cheese that other reviewers left, I just had to have it. When we arrived we were seated right away and everything else after that was a taste bud extravaganza. For one the cheese corn was good and I couldn't wait to eat it. However, that was probably the only thing we were served that was not completely demolished. The meat and complimentary sides are delicious alone the cheese overpowered the taste of the meats but was just right with the grilled mushrooms. All of the different flavors to go with the delicious tender meat is indescribable. Normally when I eat out I can call every taste in the food and go home and make it, but this place introduced my taste buds to a whole new world flavor. I can't wait to go back, I wanted to make this a weekly spot but I don't want to burn it out so me and some friends will be here once a month for sure.",

Patient and knowledgeable.  The house tea is an iced tea and it was delicious.  We ordered the beef combo.  We were immediately set up with a multitude of delicious side dishes including an awesome kimchi and pickled celery that was addictive.  The soup was rich with flavor and was hard to put down.  The beef showed up and our server prepared the meat on the grill for us as we ate.  The quality of the meat really showed through and we finished off all of the tender flavorful beef in short order.  The meal was capped by 2 head on shrimp cooked to perfection.  I will definitely add this restaurant to my list of favorite places.  Grill on!",

We were left to fend for ourselves which was fine, but we weren't given tools to do so. I can't really cook using just my fingers. Overall it was just a super awful experience. Maybe they were just having a bad day but all the other times I've gone there everything was amazing so idk.",

Right before we were seated we had to wait a little but when they took us to our table all the side dishes and grill was ready for us which was awesome! Everybody was attentive and the meat was so delicious that it's truly incomparable to the other KBBQ places in Vegas.

Pork jowl is pretty good too but I prefer Hobak's pork jowl over this place. Meat quality is definitely top notch. You get what you pay for. And the nengmyeon...... Dude, this is the place to go for it. I've tried other places in Vegas and thought nothing could compare to nengmyeon in LA but this place hits the spot. During lunch they have a special which is 8.99 for a full size bowl of nengmyeon and you can choose either mul nengmyeon or the spicy one and it comes with a side of cooked bulgogi. The full size a la carte of nengmyeon is 9.99 so for a dollar less plus a side of bulgogi.. I'm sold! Keep in mind that lunch is only mon-fri and ends at 3p. Back to the BBQ.. There aren't that many side dishes at all but they have the grill with the egg and this place doesn't do corn cheese but corn with mayo, not my fav, I prefer corn cheese. There's kimchi, salad, spicy bean sprout salad mix, and pajeon for the banchan. If you want just good BBQ, I'd probably go to Hobak but if you want good everything I'd come here. They give you a free appetizer that's similar to gazpacho and free bite size cheesecake at the end too!",

They serve much more food for around the same price, and I even liked the meat here just a tad better. Also I liked how they served not just water but some type of cold tea that supposedly very good for you liver! (for free too ;) )The sides that came with the set were not my favorite tho...I did not like the bean sprouts (it had no flavor) and the cold soup was a weird taste. The kimchi here is delish (but if you like more fermented kimchi you might not like this one) The pork was juicy and very flavorful, and the meat was tender and delicious. At hobak i was not full at the end of the meal and we ordered the Large for four people, (their menu says 4-5 people) but here at magal we ordered the one small pork and one small beef combo and had FIVE people instead of four and I could not finish at all!    Now the service was amazing. Definitely a thousand times better than anywhere else. A big shoutout to JAY and KAT. Jay was very cool and kept up with our interesting conversations. Never had a server who was actually interested in conversing with us about different things. Also even though he was chatting we could see that he was still completely on top of everything. He was constantly paying attention and doing his job (talk about multitasker!) Kat was also another one of our servers and although we did not converse with her as much she was still friendly and when my friend asked for more kimchi she definitely brought him more! We appreciated that very much.  SO.. Food 4/5 Service 5/5",

The staff was very nice they came to cook the meat when they saw us eating, gave us new grill tops without even asking (just like they do in Korea) so the previous meat flavors don't mix with the new meat your about to cook.

We had visited HOBAK KBBQ a couple days ago, and had loved it there, so when we heard about another Korean BBQ place near here, we decided to try it out and let me just say, both the food and service here are just wonderful!  First off, as soon as we entered, there was a huge waiting (45-60 minutes), but got seated sooner than expected. The hostess there greeted us with a friendly smile and tried to make sure everyone was attended to, even with some customers complaining about the wait, she still kept the smile. After being seated we looked over the menu and ordered the small skirt meat combo, and two of the spicy beef soup  (a little salty but still decent). Our server was Jane, and let me say, my girlfriend and I had never met a server this bubbly and funny with great service! Her English wasn't perfect, but we could still understand everything just fine, and because we were hungry by the time we sat down, we were a bit grumpy but we left this place feeling more than satisfied thanks to her :) She made sure to check up on us and see if we ever needed anything. We will definitely be returning here not only for the delicious food, but excellent service as well!",

    "text": "Before I get started with my review let me say that it is unfair to compare any Korean restaurant in Vegas to the L.A. standard. I see this done on a regular basis, and it is quite frustrating. 5 star restaurants are knocked down to 4 or 3 stars, and the resultant review is skewed. Restaurants in yelp reviews are to be judged relative to the market in which they exist. In this case, the market is Las Vegas. Let us keep this in mind guys and gals. Just as it is ridiculous to evaluate a burger spot in South Korea on the same scale as a burger spot in the United States, it is ridiculous to make the same comparisons between a Korean restaurant in Vegas' small Korean community to a Korean restaurant in L.A. with its massive Korean population that is about 10 times larger. Of course, the L.A. equivalent will be better due to the increased demand and competition. This is common sense, and is not something that needs be taken into account for the rating. If you really want to make some comparison to L.A., express it in a written comment, not the rating.   For The Review:  Magal is ahead of its time in the Vegas KBBQ scene, and it heightens expectations of what  Korean BBQ should be. There is no point in comparing this establishment with an AYCE Korean BBQ. They are simply on different levels in terms of food quality, service, and atmosphere. Magal takes it to the next level in these regards. The food quality is in the elite level. All of the meat is fresh and never frozen. The seasoning is just right as well. None of that overly salty or bland garbage that they eventually serve at the AYCE KBBQ spots around Vegas.   For example, how many KBBQ places do you know that provide mouthwash in the restroom for their patrons to freshen up with after dinner? Perhaps an even better question is: how many public restrooms have you been in smell better than your own room does? Magal's restroom does. They burn scented candles in the restroom, and provide Crest mouthwash and mini cups to pour it in. Ladies & Gents, this is the definition of next level shit right here.   One will only experience excellence when dining at Magal. Alex's dedication to constant improvement and customer satisfaction sets this eatery apart from its competitors. We first arrive at the establishment, and he hears my friend joke that I was a picky eater, so he personally cooks our entire meal to ensure that we have nothing but the best experience. Further, the establishment provides innovative features such as service call buttons on all of its tabletops to provide that next level service to their patrons. The outstandingly bright and friendly staff of Magal outshines the competition on a multitude of levels, setting a new standard for customer service to serve as a proper role model for other Korean BBQs to sheepishly follow. Magal brings a tried and tested experience directly from Korea to the Las Vegas streets of China Town. Eating at Magal is taking part in the revolution unfurling in the Korean dining industry right here in Vegas. Don't be left behind.",

The food was great quality. We ordered the Pork Combo and it was more than enough to fill us up. Our server Ryan was perfect as well ! (: Followed up on our requests and grilled and cut our food. And in general was a very polite and outgoing guy. Thank you for your service! Will be coming back again!",

The entire staff was always there to assist us. The total came to $48 and we had food to take home. Leave these ladies a good tip too because they work hard and are so friendly! Definitely our new go to spot for Korean food.",

Wow, I don't know if Magal's AC was out or was just very inefficient, but even with two swamp coolers in the restaurant it was cooler outside (outside was a nice balmy 110).   This made the whole dinner experience a literal pain.  Our entire party was a hot sweaty mess sitting around our cooking meat.  Once again, like Hobak and Goong, this place insists on cooking the meat for you.  Though the servers were nice enough, I find this intrusive to the flow of dinner conversation and the enjoyment of the meal itself.  We can cook it for ourselves, guys.  Thank you, but, no, thank you.  The banchan was ok - nothing special or particularly savory.  We will not be going back.",

The beef sushi was tremendous and it literally melted in my mouth.  Jennifer cooked everything on the spot for us which was awesome because everything came out to perfection. I love Korean food and this maybe the best both food quality and service wise.  The tofu soup was also surprising tasty. Within the soup, you can find beef, tofu, onions and cucumbers.  The beef definitely added more taste to it.  Almost forgot about the cream corn and kimchi steam egg.  First time I had kimchi and steam egg together, what a pleasant surprise!  One key thing to note is they change the grill after each meat.  For desert, they have the shaved ice mixed with Mochi, red bean and almonds.  It was the BOMB. Not to sweet and perfect ending to an awesome dinner. If you visit Vegas, this is a must. Overall, I am still overwhelmed with the experience!",

Everything was tasty, the banchan was good (they have Korean pancakes!), they cook the meat for you, and you ended the meal with s'mores that you cook over the grill. They have this cold tea that is pretty good and the servers keep it topped up. Good service and good food. Will come back!",

The large beef combo fed more than four people. We had leftovers for a meal for two! What I love most about Magal is that even when it's busy our food doesn't get burnt. I've been here twice and love the fact that the food is cooked for you! My husband and I were very impressed the first time we came lol. The only thing I'm not big about are their appetizers. It's different compared to what I've had at other korean bbq restaurants.",

Our favorite is the first one which is a beef skirt.  Only comes with 2 Bachman: cabbage kimchi and pickled bok choy. The salad and green onions were good.  Only comes with one hot bean curd soup.  The server cooks for you, which is nice if you're a first timer at Korean BBQ.  Not sure why but it was really cold inside but our grill was still really smokey.",

The lights around the area kinda bothered me but I guess it made up for a good Instagram shot.  I went with the beef combo with pork belly. All the meats tasted great and I had no complaints. I kinda did expect the beef brisket to not be hard frozen when they served it to us since we're paying a higher price. The beef sushi was only okay. The bachan was kinda non existent. Only kimchi, pickled celery, and some salad with bland corn dressing.   I had one huge disappointment.... They're corn isnt cheese corn!!! It was corn with cream or mayonnaise.   The soup they give with their meal was delicious and spicy! I really enjoyed that after my meal.   Also,   I'll maybe return if they change their speakers. The music sounds horrid with the speakers they're using. Felt like my ears were bleeding eating next to one.",

Out of all the KBBQ places I have eaten at in Vegas, I would have to say Magal is one of my favorites. It's not all you can eat but the portions they give you are comparable to what you would eat if you went to all you can eat. There were 7 of us and we ordered two large skirt meat combos which can feed about 3-4 people and we ended up taking some leftovers home. With the skirt meat combo they give beef skirt meat, pork skirt meat, spicy pork skirt meat, shrimp and boneless short rib sushi.  They start off by giving you Heotkkae tea which helps with your digestive system, I really love the way the tea tastes. It reminds me of the tea that they use in milk tea, minus the milk. Then they give you the banchan which is kind of limited but tasty, my favorite was the cold soup that they give you. The quality of the meat is amazing.  The service was great and the waitress was very attentive and I love how they help you cook your food.  Overall we all enjoyed the experience and I'd love to come back next time I am back in town.",

The barley tea is great! Love the snow ice they give you afterwards!  It is a little on the pricey side so I would bring a group here and share the dinner specials which would make the meal affordable. If you are any group less than 2 that's okay too but be prepared to pay a little more if you want variety.  The service is very good. Our waitress was very fast.

The grill itself is unique  it has an  area to put your meat after it is done cooking to keep it warm(plus for me I hate cold meat.) There's an egg that cooks on the side very tasty, not quite sure what the red sauce is but it doesn't matter lol. They cook everything for you which is amazing so you can actually enjoy your food. The only thing that I wasn't a fan of was the cold soup, but I tried it anyways and it is still packed with the flavors a hot soup would have.   I will most definetly recommend this place to friends and family. I forsure will be coming back!!!",

We also made reservation bit the group that came after us got their table first. So one star off for this...  This is my first non AYCE KBBQ so i was hesitant but it still was fulfilling. The server who served us was very nice. Forgot his name but he still managed  to take good care of us despite being so busy. He was sweating like crazy but still he was wonderful! Meat was very delicious",

First time to hear,  that's why they can get long and good review for the restaurant? place and food were good, but the service and server there was not friendly.",

It reminds me of Ktown Korean BBQ places in LA. David was our server. He was very helpful. We ordered beef combo for two but it was enough for a group of four. We were super full after the meal. The meats they served were very high quality. A lot better than from the AYCE places around here. We ended up paying less than what we normally would pay at an AYCE place for probably the same amount of food that we could normally eat. Higly recommended!!!",

The menu is very diverse and you will taste good that you normally can't taste in other KBBQ.  If you are looking for AYCE KBBQ then this is not your place.

The server is very attentive, and will cook your meat for you. But the downside imo with this is that you can't eat at your own pace.   The dessert was even brought to our table before we finished our meal, which was annoying because it was melted by the time we got to dessert.   Their side dishes and condiments could be way better.  Even though they are high priced they cheap out on side dishes.   I would rather drive further down on Chinatown to get AYCE and pay less.",

And to be honest all you can eat Korean BBQ places in China town has gone down hill in the last few years .  This place was fresh and clean . Good service , clean restaurant , food is on another level .   Quality cuts of beef served properly .  Very impressive .   Service is fast and attentive . The staff changes the grill faces out after every selection of meat is cooked so you always have a clean grilling surface .   The price is roughly the same as all you can eat places and you get more than you can handle with the meat combo platters that are offered .  We ordered a combo platter for 4 and paid roughly 26 dollars a person and there was still meat over .  Definitely bang for your buck .   I think this a new place . I've never eaten here before .   Will be back without a doubt .",

However the 4 person beef combo is a bit too much for only 3 people. The staff is great, day and night. Alex is super accommodating  and always goes above and beyond. Oh and late night discount 15% off entire bill.  I'm definitely a regular here but I can no longer come back. Too many times our drinks were spilled by the server . Nothing was taken off of bill. We kept coming back for the food. But, $80 plus each visit and can not get a discount or proper discount. Once a beer bottle was broken by the server and glass flew all over the table and I personally had to ask to get fresh condiments. Because glass was everywhere. Super clumsy service.",

    "text": "Alright guys so here's the deal.. I almost never write yelp reviews since its rare that I find a place good enough to warrant it. But magal more then exceeded expectations both in terms of food, service, and the quality/portion to price ratio.  In terms of the food, the galbi was probably some of the most tender that I've had at a Korean spot in Vegas or L.A. The flavors were on point as well. Now if you enjoy soju then I recommend getting the pork skin and intestine as it pairs quite well together.   Overall, the meat quality was top notch and the portion size was more than appropriate for the price point. If you're more attuned to the finer things in life and quality is as important for you as it is for me then you'll have an excellent experience here.   However, if you're thing is pigging out on cheap cuts then you'll probably want to hit up a $ establishment to better suit your needs. On that note, it's important to set expectations and understand that what you're paying for is a higher quality and more authentic Korean BBQ experience similar to what you would receive in Korea. So it's incorrect to judge the establishments merits using the similar criteria to an all you can eat spot because they're paying premiums for their meat while some of these other spots serve you week old cuts acquired on discount in some back alleyway.  In terms of the service, the servers were very attentive. We never had to touch the tongs or the uncooked meat ourselves. The servers are trained to cook the whole meal to perfection for you to maintain the integrity of the meat and so that you can focus on simply enjoying your meal. Now one of my pet peeves is having to actively search for a server to refill a food or drink item and I can honestly say this was not an issue here. Even servers that weren't directly helping us would come by and refill our drinks or side dishes if they happened to walk by and see them half full.   Final Thoughts: This place is the shit.",

They just kept getting better and better! Flavorful & tender!  SERVICE: Top notch! The entire staff seemed friendly and enthusiastically greets each incoming/leaving group. Our server Young was upbeat, friendly, and very knowledgeable about each dish. He even broke down the cooking method for some. I felt like I was learning as I was eating LOL.

You're looking to leave FULLL (even though it's not AYCE)  Now on to my review: I waited until my second time around to write this review just to make sure my taste buds didn't fool me. This second time around, Im still OBSESSED.  This is by FAR the best kbbq place I've had in a while (and I grew up in LA, so you know I've been to quite a few KBBQ places growing up).   Let's do a recap: -they give you complimentary berry tea. This heotkkae berry tea is SOOOO refreshing. It's also great for recovering from hangovers (hint hint ) -we start off strong with kimchi egg and mayo corn -the banchan makes a STRONG-ASS entrance. The homemade kimchi fucking slays. There's also a delicious black sesame salad and spicy bean sprouts  salad. They actually give you enough fiber to power through your meat-filled journey without regretting tomorrow on the toilet. You even get soondoboo (I'm definitely not spelling that correctly but whatever) to soothe your stomach -not much to say about the meat, except that's it's DELICIOUS. Great cuts and lots of umami. They also cook your meat for you, unlike other KBBQ places, so the pieces get seared beautifully  -lastly, they throw in a complimentary red bean shaved ice to finish your meal with the right amount of sweetness. The ice definitely helps with the summer heat too  TL;DR if u were looking at the Las Vegas buffets, your money is better spent here. High quality food all around.",

Though you should come here for the BBQ, they do offer a variety of Korean meals. Come here for the lunch specials! :)   The details:  - Inside is super nice: clean and well decorated. The workers are vey welcoming: as soon as someone comes in, the whole staff says \"Hello! Welcome!\" in Korean. It's pretty dope. It remind me of 85C workers with their \"FRESH BREAD!\" Haha  - The food was so good. I went with my sister and we got the (1) Hot stone bibimbap $9.99 and (2) spicy cold noodles $7.99. How do you go wrong with that? Everything was fresh, nicely seasoned, and totally authentic. Idk how else to describe it.  The spicy noodles though do not have a lot of meet at all. I also recommend you taste testing the vinegar and mustard that comes with it. Mustard has wasabi in it and I put too much. Omg.   Another thing I was impressed about was the side dishes. Kim chi and pickled radish was on point: nice sour pickling that you can feel in the back of your throat once you eat it. Not unpleasant at all.   The salad had a cool peanut dressing. NOTE: IT HAS PEANUT FOR THOSE WITH ALLEGIES. And they have pancakes as side dishes!! Omg those are my fave.   OVERALL: would come here to visit again to try the BBQ and the ambience and food were really good. :)",

The serving size is good for 5, they have unlimited salads and sides, but I love how fast the service is too! The place is neat, well-lit and clean. We appreciate how they have egg-kimchi scrambled that they cook alongside your Beef.  This is a must-try!!! Just by writing this review, I already want to go back and eat there!",

    "text": "This place is awful.   Going in, it smelled great and we were excited to try a new Korean BBQ place. But --things went downhill FAST. We were sat quickly since it wasn't crowded. We were almost immediately ready to order. The waitress took our order (a meat combo, volcano rice, and the table side seared short rib) The waitress told us NOT to order the volcano rice because she can only do it at the end of our meal?! (Made no sense) she was obviously lazy and didn't want to prepare it. Whatever. We obliged since we were hungry.   If I overheard my employee down selling tables, I'd be enraged.   Upon sitting down, the grill had side bowls of a a mayonnaisey corn salad and unidentifiable sauce. We later found out it was egg. It didn't look or seem like eggs because it never cooked! It was a soupy raw egg mess. I'm not a fan of salmonella, so we didn't even touch it.   She put our first beef dish on the grill and unenthusiastically pushed it around. She wouldn't let us flip the meat so it would evenly cook. She announced that the first course was ready to eat. It wasn't. It wasn't rare, it was gray and raw.   Repeat x2 with the rest of our meal. The waitress even turned off our grill before we were done! They weren't even close to closing time! So rude.   We made it though, picking at what looked tolerable,  and left asap... so we can go home and eat good food!  The food was loaded with MSG too. I left itchy and sneezing. I had maybe 5 bites of food. I couldn't get out of there fast enough. They even serve their HOT tea in plastic highball soda cups! Gross.   We were also never offered the included dessert, which was fine by us. It probably would've been melted ice cream or worse.   Never again. So disgusted. There are too many great Korean BBQs to waste time going here.",

I can, although, tell you that they have this sauce that I cannot get enough of (it's the sauce that comes with the nigiri looking brisket thing they serve)  The inside of magal is very futuristic lol. There's so many lights and the place is beautifully modern. The space just looks so CLEAN. It comes with the handful of banchans. I most especially love their kimchi and bean paste soup! I'm still craving for some.   My parents and I got the beef combo (57.99?) at first, by the looks of it, it doesn't feel like it would fill you up. But by the end of the meal you'll be leaving with a nice food baby. Oh, and even though it's a beef combo it still comes with 2 shrimps. For dessert they serve this simple but oh so tasty bingsoo. Perfect way to end the meal.   S/O to grace and sunny! We got awesome service!",

They were all very attentive and made outstanding recommendations.   The food was AMAZING!  The sides were delicious and plentiful. The food was very reasonably priced and was a lot for what you pay. I had the brisket and it was really really good.   Overall, if I could give this place a 10 I absolutely would. From the service to the food everything was great.",

We were too hungry to wait for an hour there, so we came here because they didn't have a wait and I've had this place bookmarked for a while.   I'd have to say, it was a great cheat night. Although it still does not take the #1 spot in my favorite Korean BBQ spots in Vegas, it has stolen #2's spot from *ahemGOONGahem*. (Which booted that to #3) lol  Hubs and I ordered the beef dinner for 2. So much fooooood. We literally had to get the last two beef choices cooked and packed to go. I think it was all the Japchae we had along with our banchan. The beef sushi was a cool experience. Pretty good too, with an A1 flavor sauce base. I loved all the meats I was able to have before becoming full. The egg/kimchi moat is such a clever idea.   Our waitress was great. I'm sorry I forgot her name, but she was an older Asian lady. She cooked our meats to perfection, and she explained everything to us since it was our first visit. We will definitely be back here as an alternative KBBQ spot.   \"Say no to AYCE KBBQ.\"",

We've been to a lot of Korean bbq places and this place is just okay at best. The side dishes were pretty good but the meat didn't really stand out. We didn't know what the yellow stuff was around the grill. We thought it was cheese but we found out too late that it was egg and it was burnt on the bottom. Oops...the beef sushi looked good but didn't taste very good. We liked the grilled pineapple more than all the meat. We were pretty disappointed since we came with high expectations after reading the yelp reviews. Yelp let us down again. Maybe it was an off day for them but still, we would not go back. There are plenty of better Korean bbq places in Vegas.",

I think they hired a lot of new people for their new found popularity and the Korea way of service is a steep learning curve, especially if you aren't Korean.  This is definitely one of your better options to head for Korean BBQ in Vegas, especially if you have access to a car and can meander outside the strip and don't mind the more leisurely pace to being fed. Definitely check it out if you're nearby.",

I've only ordered the combos during my two visits, but you can also order a-la-carte. Both times, I went with one other person, and finishing the combos was a struggle since they give you so much food!   I also really enjoy the unique grill, with its outer egg/corn rim and side rack for cooked food. I haven't seen similar grills in other Korean barbecue places.   Service is friendly, and the waiters/waitresses do the cooking for you, so will check on you regularly. The complimentary cold tea is refreshing, and on my second visit, they were giving free small bowls of shaved ice at the end of the meal too. Banchan dishes aren't too numerous, but they taste great and suffice considering the bountiful offering of meat, and come with the standard unlimited refills.  A great premium-cut alternative to the AYCE places!",

    "text": "My friends and I have been waiting for Magal to open for, what seemed to be, forever. Magal is actually has several other locations outside of Nevada. They have locations in California and, I believe, a location in New York as well. The only thing is that I feel as though they opened so late that they're at a disadvantage.  My friends and I came to have dinner about two days after their grand opening. We decided to go with two small combos. The size difference between the small combo and the large combo doesn't make sense when you calculate the price of it. You get more with two small combos when it comes down to it. We got a small beef combo and a small pork combo.   For the beef combo, it comes with brisket, boneless short rib/rib eye, marinated rib eye, boneless short rib sushi, prawns, and soybean soup. For the pork combo, it comes with pork belly, pork neck, pork collar/spicy pork skirt meat, prawns, rib eye sushi, and soybean soup.   Everything was decently good. I didn't care too much for the rib eye sushi because it's just for entertainment. They torch the raw thin slice of rib eye while it's on top of some sushi rice. So some of the rice gets torched as well and then at the end, they pour some sauce over it for you to eat. It was more like \"Oh that's really cool!\" and when you eat it, it's like \"Oh okay...\"  Everything else was pretty alright. The meat quality is really good. Also, what I did love was that our server was constantly there, cooking for us -- they were also constantly changing the grills almost every time we switched meats. The grill itself has a ring around it. Two areas had a corn salad, there was egg that was cooking on like half of the ring, and then there was an area where you can put cooked meats. I didn't like the egg portion though because if you didn't eat it at the right time, it was overcooked. Overcooked egg is meh. I think I would've preferred if they put mozzarella cheese where the egg is and that would've been better.   As for the banchan, they didn't have much to offer besides the fish cake and kimchi. The variety was puny.   At the end of the meal, I really wanted to order the volcano fried rice. It looked really interesting but if you order it, you have to order a minimum of 2 ... so we ordered two. They cooked it all in front of you at your grill. It was entertaining to watch. The flavor? Eh. Nothing to write home about.   Oh, here's the real winner of the night, a dead bug dropped onto my head. I felt something drop on my head and I was just so confused so when I put my hand there to grab whatever it was ... it turned out to be a dead beetle. Great ending! I did tell management and they were kind enough to take off the fried rice from our bill for compensating us. But it was odd -- the manager even said that they cleaned the hoods in the morning so he wasn't even sure where it came from. Plus, it's a new establishment, there shouldn't be dead bugs anywhere!!! Anyways..  Overall, I think Magal opened really late -- there have already been two new KBBQ joints that opened before them: Hobak and Goong. I have tried Hobak and I like Hobak better as a whole than Magal. Magal, to me, doesn't hold much of a difference than many other KBBQ joints aside from the server changing grills every time. For the meat quality, I can go somewhere else. For a server to cook for me, I can also go somewhere else. In the end, there's nothing at Magal that would make me go back ...",

We ordered the Beef Combo and we didn't know what else it comes with, so I asked Gina if we can order a soup as well. Then she told us the combo comes with a soup and also an appetizer. I'm used to eating at AYCE Korean bbq restaurant and I was a little skeptic about the portioning of our meat, but I was so wrong.   I love the ambiance, the service and the food. But I told Gina, about their speaker that doesn't sound good, and she told me they are working on it and replacing it soon. I like that they have ownership and acknowledge the fact that it can be an issue to some customers.   Five star because of our great experience with Gina.",

    "text": "First time eating at Magal, and I must say I was very unimpressed all the way round.   Food was average and the service was below average.  I'm used to having to wait for long periods for a good kbbq, but this place was not worth the long wait.   First off, there was 9 of us in our party and they informed us they could not seat us all together or we would have to wait about 2 hours. So we split our group and waited about 30-40 mins. Upon seating I noticed there was a long table, which was empty and could've easily sat our entire party. Maybe 30 mins into our meal a large party of 6 or 7 walks in and is seated at this table maybe 10-15 mins after (they also don't take reservations, or that's what they told us when we called in advanced). Strike 1.  Service seemed very chaotic and unorganized, especially our server in particular. It took quite awhile once we were seated to even get water and asking for refills was another waiting game in itself. Once getting our food, our server was dropping things left and right. Dropping food/dishes all over the table to tipping over our water and getting it into our side dishes. Strike 2.   Strike 3 was the food itself. I had really high hopes for this place, especially for the amount you're paying since it's a la carte! I did not find the meats to be the quality meats they claim to be and the seasoning/marinade to be nonexistent. The meats lacked flavor.  Doubt I will be going back.",

It has different kinds of beef cuts: prime rib, brisket, rib eye, boneless short rib sushi, and shrimp and pineapple. Yup, shrimp and pineapple. In a beef combo.  The drama and presentation for the short rib sushi was pretty fantastic - and it was tasty too. All the other meats were delicious and tender.  We also got bibimbap. Theirs was a bit smaller than other places' bibimbap but it was perfect since we already have a lot of food.  The service was good. They'll cook and cut the meats for you.

    "text": "This experience left an impact on me. It really gave me a whole new appreciation for Korean food itself. I realize that every place has a different style to it as far as Kbbq is concerned but I never had it in the way it was presented tonight there were definitely some similar things that were consumed tonight but they definitely put a twist to it. If you like like spicy kimchi flavor you'll love it here. I think they aim to please a demographic that likes spicy food.  Just like some of the new spots to eat Kbbq in town it's all about the packages now. For 2 people my wife and I had the beef combo. Brisket, flank,short ribs and some shrimp and we also ordered the volcano egg fried rice. We were so full that the rice was breakfast for the next day which was pretty yummy but spicy.  What surprised me the most was the grill it had compartments where the sever put this corn mixture and the steamed egg mixture that cooked while you grilled and it stayed warm the whole time. I really prefer the traditional way of steamed egg to be honest which would probably be my only thing I will say that wasn't that great. Other than that the service was great from start to finish. This place will also be an option when it comes to Kbbq plus they stay open until 3am so lucky for us! Thanks again Magal",

I had no issues getting a reservation for four on July 4th weekend. My parents were feeling extra saucy and we ordered a ton of food. We ordered the beef combo, Haemul Pajeon (sea food pancake), mool naeng myun (cold noodles), and bibim naeng myun (spicy cold noodles).   Honestly, everything here was on point. The banchan was bomb, the beef quality was amazing (check the marbling on the beef), and the noodles were pretty good. My mom was saying that they used some sort of black sesame dressing on their salads which makes it amazingly healthy. My parents said this is probably the best Korean bbq place they have had and this is after going to all the KBBQ spots in LA/OC such as Gen, All That BBQ, Byul Daepo, Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong, Mo Ran Gak, Cham Sut Gol, Shik Do Rak, Quarters, etc for years/decades. If there is a Korean BBQ spot in OC/LA, my family has been there and we have probably terrorized them with our fat asses. My parents were so impressed with the location, they were considering coming back again on the same weekend to try different dishes.   The only draw back to this place is that it is not AYCE and things can be very pricey. In addition, their doenjang jjigae (soybean stew) was meh and pretty salty. I would like to also warn everybody that it does get noisy in here. They greet and de-greet everyone very loudly. There might be a few negatives here, but the food is pretty damn good. I will definitely be back again.",

Got here on a Friday night and we were seated right away. Our server had a full section but we had great service, we never had to wait or ask twice for something to come to our table. The small combos for two can feed more than 2 people!! The combo we ordered came with three different meats, it also come with spicy squid & soup, mushrooms, and pineapple, and dessert. They also played good music which made it more of a place to come to eat with friends or you bf/gf. Our total bill was about $70 for the combo & a beer...In my opinion worth it & also, considering I only like AYCE places I'd choose this place again if I want kbbq. Be prepared to eat if you come here",

I wish I could buy both.  They had the hip hop playing in the background and that was a nice touch.  This was first time but definitely won't be my last.  Great food and great service!",

PROS: server is always cooking for you, cut your meats, and make sure you serve well and have to right sauce for your meal. DRINKS are awesome, it is like a Chinese or Korean tea I have no ideas but the thing is FREE AND REFILLED. ALL SIDE THAT SERVE WITH MEAL ARE ALL FREE TOO. I paid $49.99 ( for 2 persons ) with taxes for Pork Combo and really happy about it. Ask for dessert! They serve cheese cake bites daily but it is on house thing, so make sure to ask server to bring it out!   CONS: for those who used to all you can eat, it might not be enough for them in the term of 'quantity', but it is good to give it a try! There is not much variety of choices of pork combo $49.99 per two persons.   Overall, please give them a try!!!",

Reminded me very much of LA style Korean restaurants and LA style means that it's as close to a legit Korean style meal from Korea as you can get living in the states. And then I come to find out that they actually do have a location in LA as well, so duh, I was right.  Ordered the Magal combo (I cant believe my son and I finished everything! We didn't finish the squid because by that point we were beyond stuffed but it would've been very good with rice, wish it would've came earlier and not in the end) Meat quality was on point, loved the authentic side dishes (very Korean, not your average basic side dishes you'll find in a basic Korean restaurant), although the soup was not to my standards, my son devoured it and our waiter was kind enough to give us another order of it when my son asked if he can have more :) Through out our meal, our waiter was attentive with cooking our meats. When we were done, our waiter also gave us a complimentary Korean ice dessert, \"Pat-Bingsoo\", which I don't remember seeing in the menu let alone the menu having a dessert section, so that was very thoughtful of him :)",

But once I got over that (I chuckled because I honestly wasn't expecting that), I noticed how nice the hostess was and how extremely confusing the menu was.  Once seated, we received the House Tea which was interesting in taste. Not bad, just interesting. The waiter explained the tea was good in aiding digestion and great for detoxing and your liver. Okay, cool deal.  Settling on the small beef combination, where you choose four types of beef, it also comes with mushrooms and prawns.  You get a variety of vegetable side dishes that include pancake and the BBQ in the center of the table is surrounded by an egg Kim Chee mixture and a corn dish that cook as your BBQ cooks.  Pluses - The staff cook the food for you and are very attentive. The quality of the meat is on point and you get a good size portion.   Minuses - The beer selection is very limited. The menu is very confusing and the English of the waiters are heavily covered over in a Korean accent making it a little hard to communicate.  Despite the minuses, I'm giving this place five stars because the food was wonderful and the service was great. Plus it's authentic Korean BBQ in a clean and nice setting that doesn't leave you completely smelling like you walked out of a meat locker once you leave.  I highly, highly recommend. Foodies, you're going to love this place!",

Good price, good vibe (Although I don't like how they say their greetings out loud every time someone walks in the door which in turn had woken my baby up couple of times while we were eating and I had difficult time) best of all, GREAT FOOD!!!!!!!   I want them to offer their lunch menu for dinner too!!!!! They have this one this i've been dying to try, but it's only during weekday lunch hour.

Back to the cooking pot, it had a moat around it where Steamed egg was cooked during the BBQing, as well as aCorn medley that was Awesome. The Red Hot soup was the Best tasting I've had and so was the Kimchee Sprout Salad.  All of our meats were Great Quality and it was all finished off with their take on Spicy Fried Rice and Egg.

After dinner the dessert was a nice ice shaved ice halo halo type of treat. The server was also our cook and cooked food very well.  Their chili paste and Korean sauce was mixed up by their cooks and was a great combination of spicy and sweet tastes",

All of their side dishes were so delicious, we ordered a pork combo. It was amazingly goooooooooood! Let me tell you, I am a Korean and when it comes to Korean food I get very picky. But this place did not disappoint me at all. Besides their food, they do a good job in providing top-notch service; they checked on us very often. We even get to talk a lot with our server, actually I asked him if he was a manager he said he is an assistant manager. That's how the serivce was good.   All in all, I think this place will be #1 Korean BBQ restaurant in town. And of course it will be our kbbq joint, too ;)",

    "text": "This place is legit Korean, the most authentic place that I have been to so far (though I have yet to try Hobak). They have delicious fresh kimchee that's hard to find in Vegas. It's the unfermented kind- crisp and delicious. It's a lot easier to store the fermented kimchee for restaurants as this fresh type of kimchee lose its fresh taste quickly, so they're hard to find. Their pancakes are perfectly cooked. They shouldn't be too crispy, they were nice and soft on the inside and slightly toasted on the outside. Their salad with corn dressing is good too and the vegetables were fresh. I had the cold spicy noodles, unfortunately not as good as the side dishes. They call it bibim nengmyun but it's definitely not the traditional bibim nengmyun. They gave me a whole bowl of broth (yooksu) to add to the nengmyun and that's just not how bibim nengmyun is. It's usually topped with spicy sauce with minimal or no broth. The noodles were green and it's traditionally never green. The noodles were a bit overboiled and lost it's chewiness. The broth was off and it was kind of mediocre even with the korean mustard (gyuh-ja). Not a fan of their business method implementing rules like 2 minimum orders for certain items and not having certain items available even though it's on the menu. I get that the items are lunch specials but you have customers who are willing to pay more to try certain dishes. It's hard for me to swing by Monday to Friday during lunch time due to work, so literally, I will never get to try their special menu even if I pay more.   I probably would've rated this place 4stars if their food wasn't so bomb.",

My family and friends were hungry coming from a show and that we wanted a hearty and satisfying meal. So, we ordered prime everything, rib eye, boneless short rib, and brisket for our protein. It had nice marbling and succulent after cooking on the grill. We also had the original bibimbap and spicy fish cake. And the condiments was very complimentary to the entire meal.  Overall, the experience was phenomenal and highly recommended. I will be back for seconds.",

So I knew it was unusual and must be something wrong with the fan. It made so uncomfortable. So we asked manager if we could change a table.

We ordered the pork plater which was recommended to feed 2 people but actually feed all 3 of us for a pretty decent price. The whole restaurant is very clean and organized. The only down side was that they didn't have certain things that other BBQ places I have been to usually have; rice paper, spicy tofu soup \"without the seafood\". Everything was very easy Jay made sure we never lifted a finger expect to eat our meals. He cooked everything for us, but he didn't refill our waters, which is understandable we came at a busy time and he had other tables, so I just drank my fiance's water instead. They barely opened 3 days ago from what Jay was telling us, my fiance and I said we will definitely come back and bring more of our friends. Keep up the work you guys!!",

I highly recommend that you request him if he is available. He never let our drinks get empty and was very helpful throughout the entire night. A big plus was the music selection. It brought a great vibe to the room. The food was prepared by David and cooked by him to absolute perfection. We decided on 2 small beef pairings and 2 small pork pairings and for 8 people it was more than enough food. We finished off the dinner with shrimp that was absolutely amazing. I've been to several all you can eat K BBQ joints. This is the first non-AYCE K BBQ place I've been to and I would most certainly come back. One of the perks of this place is being able to make a reservation which is very rare at restaurants in China Town. I will definitely be coming back in the near future! REQUEST DAVID!",
