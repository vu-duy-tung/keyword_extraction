    "text": "I think it's kind of an average, run-of-the-mill Asian buffet.  Unlike most other buffets, drinks are not included in the initial price. And you pay your bill at the end of your meal, not before. But service is pretty good - dirty/empty dishes are quickly whisked away and drinks are promptly re-filled.  As for the food, there are a few standouts. The wontons were excellent, and almost tasted homemade. Most of the food were full of oil, but it's to be expected at a buffet. Soups were mostly forgettable though.  Dessert and fruit section were pretty vast. The fruits here actually looked and tasted fresh. And there's your standard chinese buffet desserts like soft serve ice cream, almond cookies, macaroons, cake, etc.  I wouldn't drive out of the way to come here, but it's good for a cheap filling meal if you're in the area.",

The restaurant's decor is nothing to write home about, and there is no way I'm going there with a date or anything. But the service is surprisingly great for a buffet, water refills come very fast and they are by to clean up the plates as soon as I go back for another round.

    "text": "Excellent Chinese Buffet. Of course it's not the best quality Chinese food, it is a BUFFET. One thing that's been really bugging me about Yelp lately is how so many people compare buffet food to restaurant food, which just isn't fair as buffets work on a totally different level. /Ramble. Anyways, the Krazy Buffet is definitely one of the better Chinese buffets. I loved the spot Penda's on Spring Mountain@Rainbow (It closed recently. R.I.P.), but that was pretty much hangover/stoner food, and I'm still upset over the $11.00 I wasted at New China. Krazy Buffet on the other hand is always fresh and good quality. There's quite a bit more seafood than usual to be found here, however, the seafood items are ironically the least fresh of all the offerings in the buffet. The sushi ain't half bad though.  The service is decent enough, my drink was never empty.  They also offer french fries and garlic bread. That gave me some interesting ideas to say the least, since Chinese food is something I love to improvise with.  Don't come here expecting it to be on par with the best Chinese restaurants or takeout places, and trust me, you'll love it.",

The servers Are quick to clear your plates so you don't have to Worry about a bunch of plates on your table while you Eat and they keep on top of making sure your drink Is full. The only thing I saw there I didn't like was when we were leaving the manager was debating with a  customer who used a coupon for 10 people she verified on the phone she could use it, gave it to the cashier  when they left and the cashier did not apply it. The customer came back in when she noticed they didn't apply coupon and the guy who was dealing with the issue told her  she should have made sure they applied the coupon before  she left and that he remembered talking to her on the  phone and that she had the coupon. To me that is terrible customer service it should not be her responsibility to  make sure they do their jobs right and she should not have to debate on them fixing it. If you knew she had a coupon, and it was not applied how hard is it to fix the problem. I am not sure how it ended because we left but I was not impressed With the type of customer service I was seeing.",

This was my second time coming and the only complaint that I have is that they do not bring out the crabs that often. My friends and I were there for over an hour and the crabs only came out twice and was gone in less than 5 minutes. Many people wait for the crab to come, so we basically had to stare at the buffet area so we can get some when they brought it out. It's a little disappointing when you can't really go get food freely at a buffet. Also the service isn't that great either, but it's cheap so can't really complain too much.",

    "text": "AYCE Chinese buffets have been a favorite of mine since the mid-90s when I used to frequent the (now closed unfortunately) Top Buffet in Wilmington, Delaware.  This place has a lot going for it, but also has some not-so-good things going for it.  Mostly the good outweighs the bad.  The bad stuff primarily stems from the people that can often be seen there.    Once when my fiancee and I went, we noticed a little boy that was dropping his food all over the floor, then proceeded to crawl down and eat it...OFF THE FLOOR.  His Mother was either not noticing this at all, or simply ignoring him.  Another time we went, we had to endure a large party of people with screaming kids whose parents just kept yelling at them to settle down, which obviously didn't help.  Again, these are matters that aren't the restaurant's fault, but I do think they should be wary of people that are making unnecessary loud noises or shouting, disturbing other patrons of the place.  The food though is delicious.  I love their salt and pepper squid, the meatballs on a skewer, the steamed pork buns, and the coconut shrimp!  Not too big a fan of their sushi selection, but thankfully I can enjoy sushi at a wide variety of other places here in town my fiancee and I frequent!  Plus, you never know who you may run into while eating! One time we ate there, we saw Joe Jackson (Michael's Father) come in to eat!",

Sushi selection is large- about 8 different rolls with at least one vegetarian and one fried option, but most are variations of Philadelphia and California rolls. Primary fish used are crab and spicy tuna, lots of avocado in use here but in one roll it had more of a guacamole flavor to it. Not the best quality fish, but large selection for a price under what you'd usually spend on a single roll at an actual sushi restaurant.  Soups are fresh, won ton was good but broth was a bit too oily for my liking. Fish used in cooked dishes (baked salmon, grilled seabass, seafood delight) was underseasoned and over cooked.  Other items were decent: salad bar and dessert area had the usual choices, plus an octopus salad that had way too much jalapeno for my liking. Chicken wings were fried but tasted fresh. Chinese options weren't overly Americanized or greasy: beef and broccoli, a sad-looking lo mein, several tofu options.  Service was fine, food was fairly fresh and staff were all over the place wiping spills and clearing tables. Was surprised to go here solo and get seated at a booth. Lunch price is $8.96 including tax, tipped cash.",

We have been here a few times in the past as well that as before Yelp :)  We have found that the earlier you go in for dinner or lunch the better it is as with any buffet same with this one for them for bringing out hot fresh food.  The night we went in it was pretty busy and the food was being replaced pretty fast. My husband really likes the crab legs. They are not big but they are ok to satisfy your craving! The Sushi is not at all like going to a Sushi place but it is passable. They do put out a few different kinds of rolls.. Like I said it is ok nothing that satisfies my cravings for Sushi but I did have a few pieces and they were just ok.  The price for lunch and dinner is not too bad. Nothing like the strip buffet prices.  Over all the food is just ok, it is usually hot and the items that I did try were not too bad. I am not too crazy about Chinese food at a buffet. I would much rather have it made fresh for me.   The staff keeps the plates cleaned up real good and drinks filled pretty fast even when busy.  Would we recommend? Sure if your looking for inexpensive buffet to get full on you will do  that here!",

They are open 7 days a week from 11a-9:30p. Lunch is served Mon-Fri only. I would say the earlier you get here, the better. When I went at 8pm, the food was not being turned over as there were not many diners. When I went earlier in the day, the food was being made faster and things were fresher.   So this buffet has your standard Americanized Chinese food, as well as sushi and dessert. A lot of the items on the buffet are fried, and holy sodium Batman, drowning in msg. The items were a hit or miss. Some of them were cold and flavorless, others were hot and flavorless. Some actually tasted good and were at the correct temperature!   Things I enjoyed Miso soup Potstickers Cream cheese rangoon House beef  Coconut chicken  They had some good desserts, almond cookies (my fav), and a really delicious coffee flavored cake and mousse. Price for adult dinner is $12.99, which does not include a drink. But if you go to their website they have coupons so you can get 10-15% off depending on the meal.",

The sushi rolls are not really great but I figure if one wants sushi, go to a darn sushi joint that specializes in that cuisine. Krazy Buffet is not one to be scrutinized for its sushi.   Basically, you get what you pay for... I always have lunch here for $7.99 and the food is well worth that deal. (well, except for the hot n sour soup.. it's kinda bland)",

I went there with a friend yesterday.We've both been there before and I've eaten here on at least 10 or more previous occasions.I always enjoy the food TREMENDOUSLY here.They have a pretty decent variety and the food is very fresh and extremely tasty.I probably end up eating more here than just about any other Chinese buffet I go to.The manager (Daniel) and staff are extremely friendly and personable.          Some of my favorite items include cocktail shrimp (with cocktail sauce). I really like this and most Chinese buffets do not have this.I would also recommend their garlic shrimp(extremely delicious flavor),pepper steak(tender),steamed fish,teriyaki chicken and a variety of other items you may like depending on your tastes and preferences.Their sushi selection is average,not bad but not spectacular,but to tell the truth,I enjoy the regular dishes so much that I rarely eat the sushi.         Buffet Asia used to be my preferred Chinese buffet but Krazy Buffet has definitely replaced it as my favorite.My comments are based on the lunch buffet.You can go to the dinner buffet for about four dollars more but I haven't done that yet.I assume they might have a few extra items but I'm more than satisfied with the lunch selection.If you go to their web site,they have some coupons that you can print which will give you either a 10% or 15% discount depending on what time of day you go there.        In closing,I truly recommend to anyone that is reading this review that you pay at least one visit to this place.If you do,I think you will go back again.I would come here at least once a week if they were closer to where I live.Try it.If you like it,post here and let us know.",

Large dessert section too to keep the little ones, and adults happy. :)",

Krazy has steamed fish and their chow mein was flavorful (unlike most buffets where it's just oil and sodium). They have seafood and a wide variety of meats and veggie dishes.

Selection wise they really have a little bit of everything - salad, sushi, egg rolls, cream cheese wontons, coconut shrimp, crab legs, broccoli chicken, and anything else you can think of. The price is also super reasonable too, but they do charge around $2 for soda/tea so if you're looking to conserve some money, stick to water.

My boyfriend and i come here every few months to pig out and it does the job. There are better places to get Chinese food or sushi or even crab legs, but they probably won't be as cheap for as many options. We mowed through 2-3 plates each and our entire meal was about $22 plus tip, less than we spend at most fast food joints.

My boyfriend and I came In today around 2:00 it was starting to get busy. The lunch buffet was 8.99 ! What a steal! The things I recommend is the sauteed mushrooms, orange chicken, barbecue chicken, malsadas,spicy chicken, pancit, chicken wings and pot stickers! The only thing I didn't like was the brocoli beef everything else was yummy! Great dessert selection! Will definitley return here !",

The floor was a mess. The food was not kept up. When we arrived the pizza was gone. Our daughter wanted pizza so we asked and they said it's coming.  Never put it out until we were done and paying. The crab legs were way over cooked.  They had a yellow color to them. When we talked to management about this they said \"oh really\" she didnt care. We won't be back. Cost over $60 for four people. Def not worth it.",

You can't beat this eatery for the  price and the amount of quality food they put  out! The best for last. Daniel (GM) is who really  makes this restaurant great! Customer service is so welcoming, He is a step above the rest, always caring to his guest, he has known for  years, or the first timer! A favorite place to  visit and eat when coming to Vegas. Kudo's  to all staff, especially to wait staff, always attentive and professional.Come on people! Be generous,  leave a generous tip, for all the service they  provide you!! Sad to see the disrespect, they  can receive! Love Daniel and Krazy Buffet.",

Dinner consisted of crab legs, oysters, fried shrimp, clams, white fish, chicken, beef broccoli, etc. hate to say it but they cook similar to my mom but better. Yes, it's sad. I have one of those moms. Where I really don't want to go home and eat her cooking. The selection here is pretty decent. I did not bother to try sushi bc I go to a sushi restaurant for those. But it looked ok. The oysters were pretty good.  They had 4 soups of wonton, beef, sweet and sour, egg drop, the usual suspects. So the wonton soup was only ok but I stuck green onions on my beef broth as it was good enough. I find that coming in with low expectations makes everything not that bad. They had quite a few desserts. The macaroons are soft and tasted ok. Had grapes and watermelon for dessert. Watermelon was crunchy.  Service was ok. Most smiled at me as I passed them and my plates miraculously disappeared when I came back. I dined Han Solo so had a chance to actually eat and observe quite a bit. I don't know why ppl complain so much for a $14 dinner buffet. A Korean and Japanese one starts at $26.  This is the kind of place where parents with loud screaming kids like to come. And yes, every time I am here they do not disappoint and bring their h e double hockey sticks spawn with them. Must be glorious to have such wonderful little buggers.",

We regretted so much that we went to Rio world carnival buffet and The Buffet at Bellagio where we forked up $26+ per person for less than mediocre quality food before finding this place. We will never go to these two buffets again. Wow, we are so happy for our lunch here that we came back again four days later for dinner. Service is good. Even we don't expect to eat lobsters and top grade sashimi here, but for $8.75 and $12.xx, hay, for pretty good quality food, can't beat that price.

I really enjoy the pot stickers and chicken on a stick  and as much broccoli as I can stuff. Dessert is OK but not a rave. It seems to be busy always, or at least when we go, Since the price doesn't include drinks like casino buffets it isn't the cheapest but it is well in line with non mega casino buffets and well worth the trip since you don't have to go in a casino and possibly get lured  into a gamblethon.",

    "text": "WORST buffet we have ever been to.    We originally went here for the AYCE crab legs, but the crabs are a joke.  They're basically the crab shell and if you're lucky you will get a little crab meat if you search inside.  The rest of the food available in the buffet was nothing to talk about.  There are TWO main reasons we will NEVER EVER EVER go back here!  1)  There was a long, black hair found in my friend's house steak.  Neither of us have black hair, so obviously couldn't have been ours after we received our plates.  My friend was a little more compassionate to this, since she does work with food as well and we do have to consider it's a buffet with lots of people hovering over food throughout our visit, but still.  2)  After we found the hair in her food, she told the server about it.  His response was 'Ok.'  That was it!  Not an 'I'm sorry,' or 'Let me take the food away for you.'  This is what made the experience worse than the food.  The service is AWFUL.  Worst server I've ever had.  Even when he took our plates away before it seems like he was annoyed he even had to do his job and was rushing us to get out of there, which after we found the hair I didn't mind doing just that.  At the cashier, my friend complained about the hair in her food and the cashier was a little more apologetic for it and offered her a $3 discount.  I didn't get a discount at all.  I guess we were better off taking what we could get and getting out of there and never looking back!!  If you're looking for a good buffet with crab legs, don't waste your time here.  Pay the little bit of extra money and go to Palms or Rio",

    "text": "My wife and I came here for a small birthday gathering last week. I would categorize this place under what I call\" chinese junk food buffets\" as its very similar to Vegas buffet on Flamingo and Buffet Asia (several locations). The food is your straightforward chinese spread with fried foods, stir fried foods, ice cream, bought in desserts, sushi, and more fried foods. Prices are cheap (around $10 for lunch and $13 for dinner) and there is ample seating. I would say the experience was decent.  The best items at this place are the crab legs, clams, spicy chicken, coconut shrimp, and apple pie. Now some of you are thinking, \"Why would they have apple pie?\" I have no idea!.... but you can't really go wrong with apple pie with ice cream.  If you are really hungry and near the area, then this is the place to eat.",

    "text": "Food here is great for the price especially for dinner. Used to come here a lot. My only real complaint is on the customer service. The waitresses are very pushy when it comes time to pay the bill. They slip you the check in the right middle of your meal and expect you to pay up immediately (at least make you feel that way since they seem to hover near/around your table taking short glances to see if you have placed the payment). While that part is sort of annoying, the last straw was when the waitress started demanding her tip. Not to bring race into it but it is usually the restaurants with Asian decent that seem to believe that tip is mandatory. (Note: I am Asian myself relax). My suggestion for improvement is to take the payment in full as you enter, or when you leave. It feels rude when your meal is interrupted for payment. While that part can be ignored, at least don't try and force your customers to pay up the second you drop the bill at the table.",

It just wasn't warm enough for me to eat. Also the price for 2 adults came out to 31.00 approximately. They do not include the cost of drinks. No free refills.",

There are alot of clams that remained closed after being cooked, that means the clam actually died BEFORE it went into the pot, which can be a dangerous vector for food borne illnesses.  And for $12 a person for this kind of crap? Stuff that is unsanitary and can potentially kill us?

Overall the food all tasted the same. I could practically taste the msg in every dish. I decided to try their sashimi which was rubbery and bland. The fish was lazily placed over a small bed of rice with no real form to it. Thumbs down to that. There was one roll with spicy tuna that was probably the only decent choice. To top it off the shrimp was SOGGY. When I eat shrimp I expect it to be fresh and sort of burst with juices. Not these. They were like mush in the shape of shrimp. Not really sure why, my guess is that it had been sitting out all day...I got there during the lunch to dinner transition and there were signs all over the buffet glass warning of an upcharge if we were \"caught\" eating from the dinner menu. I gave this place an extra star because the staff was all very friendly and attentive. Unfortunately the food did not follow suit.",

The sushi was bad and I did not even want to try their pizza.  I will not say the name of the place but there is another Chinese buffet on Rainbow, a few blocks from Krazy buffet and it is ten times better. The only reason why I went here is because my date insisted on it because her friend recommended it. When I took her to that spot she immediately noticed the night and day differences. The best part is their lunch buffet is only $10. Their dinner is the same price, I think it is a few dollars more $17 but they give you real crab legs, sushi, beef and food.

    "text": "This Asian buffet was cleaner than most and even provided a private room, plus 3 extra tables for our birthday dinner of 30. That wasn't even half the establishment, can you believe that?!   Food was good compared to others and they were running out so quickly that they kept refilling the trays with fresh and hot food. Waitresses at our section were quick to refill our drinks and were accommodating to the crazy kids running around.   Place was pretty full, but food spread was far enough apart from one another that it was hard to bump into people. Good use of space.  I wouldn't mind coming back and trying some other dishes. The kids flocked to the frozen yogurt section and filled their cones up as high as they would go.   Thanks to Krazy buffet for hosting us!",

I've tried almost everything and it's very tasty. For $11.99 this is a great deal and can't complain. It is typically very busy but the people at the front are very accommodating and try their best to get you in as soon as possible. The server we had was really awesome, she was absolutely slammed and she always made sure we had fresh drinks, enough napkins, and took our dirty plates as soon as we were done. She was constantly smiling and was just overall really pleasant. I would recommend this place!",

We are usually offered drinks right away, the staff comes around and pick up the dirty plates very often which is very nice, and they are also pretty good with refilling the drinks.   This Asian style buffet in my opinion is better than others such as Asia buffet. They have a bigger variety of food, they have shrimp cocktail and oysters, sushi, and a nice blend of meats and vegetable options. A pretty decent place for a cheap dinner.  UPDATE: Wrote this review right after I ate here... it is the next day and my brother threw up all night and I had bathroom issues all night. We are sure this is from the oysters... this is our first time eating the oysters from here and is the first time we experience any issues after eating here. Eat the other food...avoid the oysters!!",

I had to wait until I got my second round of food for the server to come and bribg me a drink. I think if your party is big and gets stuck in the room sometimes the server forgets about your party. I had to flag our server down a couple of times to ask for drinks for some of our party as well as for myself.   The crab legs were good. Some had barely anything inside and some had a good amount. The egg drop soup was really good and the walnut shrimp was a bit tangy. I liked the deep fried shrimp too.   I thought it was cool that they actually had a candle we borrowed to put on a dessert for my mom's birthday so we could sing happy birthday to her. Also they have coupons where you can get 10% off and you just have to print it and give it to them when paying.",

    "text": "I sing with in harmony with Dionne Warwick ... walk on by.  In my seemingly never-ending quest for a high-quality, non-casino, AYCE Chinese buffet somewhere in the Valley, I drifted in here while on West Sahara on business with one of my jewelers.   This is pretty bland food-as-fuel, nothing more.   The waitress was polite and her service was adequately attentive.  The buffet offered an entire steamer-station full of just seafood choices. For-real, not-imitation, crab legs was the clear draw, but there were various other, somewhat odd, choices such as stuffed mussels. I avoided all of that, until the venue 'earned my trust,' so to speak. Except I did slightly sample the salt&pepper calamari. Meh.  And while there were a lot of choices, the buffet seemed somewhat light on the traditional entrees one might expect to find in such a place. You know, the usual suspects: Beef w/ Broccoli, Kung Pao chicken, et. al. Just not many of those guys in the house.  So, in the end, I stuck close to the soups, the teriyaki chicken-on-the-really-pointy-stick, the crab Rangoon, egg rolls, lo mein noodles and such. Removing the dried-up, baked-on chicken from the stick was dangerous enough to be a mission for Special Forces. There wasn't a single item I could describe as desirable enough to want to return.   Again, in a word, bland.  And I wasn't entirely surprised that my tummy was somewhat queasy for at least a couple of days afterwards. And every time it groaned, I heard it saying 'sayonara' to this joint for sure.  I shouda guessed. I suppose I was KRAZY to go in there in the first place. The quest continues.",

Another star off for lacking in some areas. Deserts and fruits are their weak points--and I love deserts!   Go here if you just want a no BS asian buffet. Good all around, but not great at anything.  EDIT: I've been here for dinner. Not exactly worth the extra $$$ for the dinner service, but they do have different dishes. The coconut chicken (which is the \"leftovers\" bits of the chicken (skin, tendons, scraps) at lunch) turns to coconut shrimp, they add in some seafood, and the choppy tri-tip mix.",

    "text": "We give this place 4 stars for their VERY affordable price and decent food quality. Its buffet  chinese food ok. They have good servers despite of their cheap customers. One star less because their host/cashier staff aren't great and the sushi are not good but hey, its not a Japanese restaurant.  Hubby and I come here about once every 3 months or so when we have a great crave for crab legs and feeling cheap to go elsewhere. Plus the only meat I eat is seafood and am very picky with so we like that this place always has something for me (crabs and some shrimp) instead of going elsewhere paying a fortune and I don't touch any of the other entrees. But really this place is CHEAP! The service is good. There are a couple of gals that we really like having as servers, one of them is Jenny. They refill drinks, check back on you and clean up your mess constantly. The guys not so much. You have to flag them just to get a refill. Also don't hesitate to ask for extra crackers since they only give one per table, they are whiling to give you more if you just ask. We took my dad here this past Sunday for dinner. He was amazed how cheap the price was and pointed that this place was A LOT cleaner than the other place, Buffet@Asia lol. I've been there probably 5 times. First time with my husband and the rest because some family/friends dragged me there and couldn't be too picky because I wasn't paying. Anyway, we were talking about how cheap the cost of the dine was and how worth it it was. We noticed how other tables around us didn't seem like they tipped much or at all. We weren't trying to look and talk about how much other people tipped and what not we individually noticed how cheap their customers can be. Food was CHEAP, quality was decent and service was decent. We felt bad. We follow our standard of doubling tax for a basic eh, so so service and triple for a good service. But not tipping is just plain RUDE. Don't eat out if you \"won't\" tip. Its Vegas people! Yes, it is their jobs but these employee ofter depend on tips to make a living. We get it IF the service was bad and not tipping can probably justify that but like said servers were decent. Its a buffet restaurant, do you really expect your servers to chat with you?  This is our favorite Chinese buffet restaurant just to put it out there.",

    "text": "I've eaten here quite a few times, including today. Mostly for lunch. To me, this place is one of those places where you can expect good food for a cheap price. This place definitely delivers that much.  For $8.29, the food is pretty good. You have your Chinese-American regulars, such as orange chicken, wonton soup, dumplings, fried rice, chow mein, etc. But you also have steamed fish, pork ribs, clams, vegetable tempura, Americanized sushi, and... *trumpet sounds* a soft serve ice cream machine.  They have a pretty good assortment of food choices. I personally prefer to get a cheap Chinese chicken wing craving fulfilled here during lunch. Plus, their apple strudel dessert is one of my personal favorites. For those with kids, don't fret, because they have french fries and pizza for them little picky eaters.  A positive thing to note is that they have salt & pepper shrimp WITH the head and legs on. You can eat the whole thing. And I just love that salt & pepper taste.  The restaurant interior is nice, but it reminds me of when I used to live in less-than-ideal areas. The seats are kind of sticky and graffiti in the restroom is noticeable. However, I don't really mind since I know I'm getting a decent meal at a very affordable price.  Overall, this place is one of my go-to spot for a cheap lunch. All of the food here is pretty good and you won't break the bank eating here.  PS. You can print out a coupon from their website, ranging from 10-15% off, depending when you use it.",

    "text": "I went here for lunch last week with a friend of mine. It was cheap, fresh and delicious. They had quite a crowd for lunch, which was no problem, the dishes were filled as fast as they were depleted. The Chinese dishes were all above par. The salt and pepper shrimp and the salt and pepper squid were my faves. I didn't try the sushi because I was bothered by the fact that it was all covered in plastic wrap, which meant that one would have to touch it to pull it up to get a piece.   Overall it's good for a Chinese buffet, cheap and fast too!",

    "text": "I finally got around to trying this place after several people had suggseted it to me.   I've come to the conclusion that ALOT of these type Buffets are basically serving the same dishes and what stands out is the things that they offer that the others dont.  I arrived late for lunch around 3pm and even at that late hr the place was active with people -a good sign. The place was well lit and I was offered a nice comfortable booth where I could spread out my paper and read. I even lucked out and was sitting across from a crying baby!! lol   As I said, they are basically serving the same thing as other places with the difference here being Sweet Potato French Fries, fresh breaded shrimp & Fish with cocktail & tartar sauce available. They also had peeled shrimp on ice as well as whole fried shrimp and grilled shark. Also \"coconut chicken\" was offered but the chicken was more breading than substinance but the sauce was very good, they even have a fresh sushi station with several types of rolls available.  The desert station was pretty pedestrian with no standouts at all other than the small coconut cake squares they were offering were dry and stale which is nbd as I really wasnt there for desert.  I also got to see them putting out the dinner items such as the snow crab legs and while thin, they looked good.   Overall I'd have to say try this place because you cant go wrong. Of the 3 places on Sahara I still rate Buffet @ Asia #1, followed by this place and Pacific Buffet at #3.",

    "text": "For an Asian buffet, it's pretty on par with what you'd expect, mediocre fried bits of God knows what plus the occasional decent chicken or pork dish. However, if everything is fried which I understand is a simple effective way of cooking about-to-expire seafood and meat, please dear god change out the oil once in a while. Every single thing tasted like shrimp. I put my fork down, praying for everyone around me to be done. They must have been going insane from the heat outside, for they were loving every morsel of food even pirates might turn down on a deserted island. When desert was acquired what seemed like days later, I was not so pleasantly surprised to find the fried puff pastries and assorted fried deserts all tastes like shrimp! They really need to get up to par with the changing of the oil weekly, plus frying different foods in different friers. Not to mention I was extremely sick the rest of the day. Simply creating a schedule of maintenance and temp logs would alleviate many of their problems. Sheer laziness is not excuse to hawk crappy food and call it a buffet.",

    "text": "Krazy Buffet? What is KRAZZYYYY about a great buffet with a huge selection of Chinese and Japanese deliciousness. I walked in not knowing what to expect because there have been some gross buffets in Las Vegas so I went in without any expectations.  Luckily I made a great decision and the food was fresh, hot, and scrumptious. They had plenty of greasy, fried appetizers that were all tasty and a great start to the meal. To my surprise the sushi was really fresh and there was a dedicated sushi chef making rolls the whole night which was refreshing to see. Generally when you head to a buffet the sushi is fairly fishy smelling and rarely edible but kudos to the sushi chef here.  If you are looking for a buffet where the busboys take your plates creepily within 2 seconds of finishing your meal then Krazy Buffet is the nuts. I felt like I was being hurried up every time he'd grab my plate before I even stood up. If that was my only knock on the whole experience I guess I can't be too upset with the overall experience. Give it a shot, then thank me later.",

They even bring you a shell/bone plate when they realize you're about to go to town on the crabs! Awesome service! Dishes that were really good :  1) Did I mention the boiled and fried crabs? 2) Shrimp and asparagus, very tasty. 3) Hot and sour soup 4) Gai lan 5) Honey dew melons 6) Coffee/tiramisu mini cake  Dishes that were average:  1) Sushi options 2) pork buns 3) Some \"spicy\" chicken dish  Dishes that were below average:  1) beef and broccoli ..pretty bland 2) seabass ..this was disappointing and had a funny taste 3) pork dumplings ..also had a funny taste  Unfortunately I didn't really eat much other than crabs. Note there might be a wait depending on how big your group is. Looks like some people had been waiting for several minutes but somehow we got in within 2 mins with 2 adults, 1 kid, and 1 kid that required a booster.",

They had nothing to say and we still had to pay $45 for our family. The lady at the register was rude as well, and didn't seem concerned whatsoever about the complaint we had. We will never come here and I highly suggest you try the Rainbow location. Not to mention this location doesn't have the Mongolian bar or half the food that it's other location does.

It was around 3:40pm when we got seated and the man seating us was asking if we were going to do lunch or dinner. Didn't make sense at first but I realized when I was getting food it's because dinner has crab legs included (4pm dinner). I realized this because there's a sign by the crab legs stating if you get some then there's an automatic dinner charge. My boyfriend had told him dinner so we decided to try out the crab legs as well. They weren't bad. For a dinner price of $14 what can you expect. They went fast and they didn't seem to want to refill them with more til about an 30 to 45 min later. I thought all the food was pretty mediocre. There wasn't anything special. There was sushi and that was really good. I like the sake (fresh salmon and rice) sushi but they would go fast and they wouldn't refill them. I fact it wasn't refilled even when leaving. If you see ones eating those the most why not refill them? Overall the experience was okay for paying the amount we did. You can't expect much really. Tables were clean. Food seemed like they were at right temperatures for being at a buffet. There were utensils for all items. The servers were attentive. If your hungry and looking for something affordable, this would be a place.",

I've only been here for lunch which is around $7 ~   I like Krazy buffet because it looks relatively clean and they have a good variety of food especially seafood! All i really need here is a cup of hot and sour soup and a big plate of green veggies and their fish... Their steamed ginger & garlic fish is soooo good. Not the best quality but hey... $7???!   HOT TIP: my friends tell me for dinner they offer crab legs and oysters..!!!",

Put this food on fancier plates, on the strip and it would be $18+ per plate imho.   Service was prompt and consistent though it may have lacked little cheer.   Music was modern though a bit too quite. Would have liked it much louder.   Decor was dated and lacking but the facility was well maintained and clean. I felt safe eating the food and was still happy days later.   I give them five stars because at the price point I think if there were six I would do six. The buffet just down the street wants $18 a person.",

I would definately recommend this buffet!",

    "text": "I friggin' love a place with a goofy name, especially buffets.  The image of a \"krazy\" buffet for me would be loud colors, customers and a general orgy of food.  I guess because it was rainy, 11am on a weekday and everyone is broke as a joke, it wasn't exactly KRAZY.  However, $6.99 weekday lunch... and a friggin' 15% off coupon for senior citizens.  I got the senior citizen discount as well since I was dining with my parents.  I would have been okay to pay full price, but hell, that's more $$$ for next time!  If you are a veteran of \"Asian\" buffets (primarily of Chinese food with some Korean and \"sushi\" mixed in), then this will be a familiar typical experience... except that it's friggin' $6.99!!!  Even Asia Buffet II cannot compete with that.  Yes, the selection is a little lighter than AB II, but that is fairly reflected in the price.  In case you have never been to an Asian buffet, first of all, tsk, tsk.  You are missing out.  Basically, you are looking at AYCE chow mein, rice, broccoli beef, dumplings, four soups like hot and sour, wonton, egg flower and if you are lucky westlake, kung pao, string beans, deep fried tofu, possibly some Korean short ribs and sushi (of the roll variety with a smattering of hand rolls).  If you upgrade to dinner, you extra money goes into the sushi selection and the addition of crab legs.  My general policy is that this is not worth the extra money since sushi and crab are on my list of \"Things not to go cheap on\".  I suppose that Krazy makes up some of its food costs by charging $1.39 for a beverage, including tea.  Though, they only charged $1.39 for the table, rather than each as would be the case if it were sodas.  I am not entirely sure if a second pot would have yielded another $1.39 charge since we only got one pot.  If you are that strapped, then be sure to ask.  Anyway, I think that this a great place after a night of drinking or perhaps after losing your whole stack to a 10-3 suited.  Happily, I was just hung over.",

    "text": "My mom wanted to come here yesterday for lunch since she had received a $30 gift certificate from one of her friend's for Christmas. At first my sisters and I were all apprehensive since we're very picky about buffets. My dad has owned and operated several buffets in his lifetime and we have all worked in one or more of his restaurants in the past. My mom said she likes this place because it looks very clean. She said although they don't boast the biggest selection its cleanliness outweighs this by far.   I ended up eating only one plate since that's what always happens to me at buffets. I can never seem to pig out or stuff my face. I tried many different things but this time I was pretty conscious of what I put on my plate. I didn't want to get a lot of stuff and end up wasting half of it so I got a little bit of the things that did seem appetitive to me at the moment. I got random things such as the Blue Fin Shark (my sister said her portion tasted sour, don't know how that could have happened), a very plump chicken wing, a big dollop of Chocolate Pudding, a big plate of clams, Coconut Chicken (very similar to Walnut Shrimp, which they don't serve), a cucumber and tomato mix, seabass, sauteed spinach, two pieces of two different rolls, etc. All-in-all everything wasn't bad and I liked the fact that they offered multiple types of fish and seafood in general. FYI, they serve raw oysters for dinner. They also serve some Chinese buffet staples such as egg drop soup, hot & sour soup, lo mein and sweet & sour chicken along with fresh fruit and various desserts.  The place was pretty packed when we were here and there seemed to be a constant trickle of customers coming through the doors. We ate pretty quickly since we wanted to get our shop on at Stein Mart, which is conveniently located in the same strip mall. The total came out to be $33 something for the four of us.  The soft serve ice cream was more water based and icy than it was creamy. I know my dad's soft serve ice cream spat out ice based ice cream too so I can conclude now with certainty that Mc Donald's soft serve ice cream is the best. The ones offered at buffets can never and will never measure up. So in other words don't get your hopes up on one of these soft serve machines.",

Before you read my review take this into consideration, its $7 for lunch & $12 for dinner ALL YOU CAN EAT Asian-ish buffet....WHAT DO YOU ExPEct? Definitely NOT gourmet food!? THat would be one helluva KRAZY idea! In a nutshell salad looked unappetizing, chicken wings were good til I discovered it was because of the MSG that they use on it, egg drop soup tasted like scrambled eggs swimming in cornstarch soup, kalbi beef had an after taste as well as the baked green mussels ( I can taste/smell meats etc when they have been properly washed or cleaned, they have a certain stench to them even after they are cooked) the sushi looked unappealing and the fish did not look fresh, the desserts consisted of canned fruit of the lowest grade possible, almond cookies, chocolate mousse etc., they did have a chocolate & vanilla soft serve yogurt machine but bananas smothered with red sauce? Interesting.... At least they had sliced fresh oranges. They did have crab legs for dinner as well as seasoned crab pieces. The ok dishes for me were the chop suey, the pot sticker and the fried rice. Hey at least the food is edible...not a total waste of money. If you are looking for a place to just satisfy your hunger that is within your budget that can give you the variety you crave then you have come to the right place! Oh and by the way I think that buffet @ Asia has way more varieties and fresher more delicious food than here, it is more expensive though. Bon apetit!",

    "text": "Every time me and my family visits Vegas, we search for crab leg buffets because back in Hawaii a crab leg buffet is $30+ a person. Here at Krazy Buffet it was $13.99 per person!  I had to take away one star because we thought both locations had crab legs. We first arrived at the N Rainbow location and as my family went up to make their plates, I was like WAIT where's the crab legs?! I asked around, one worker didn't speak English so she didn't understand me.. Asked our server and she told me their location at Sahara only has crab legs. We left and went straight to this location. We felt super bad, a couple plates were made and one fountain drink ordered... I offered to pay whatever but they were understanding and actually let us go. THANK YOU FOR THAT!  When we got to this location it wasn't that busy. We got here around 7:30 pm on a Friday night. We loved that it was clean! Even the bathrooms! Lol. There were a lot of dishes to chose from. Everything we had was REALLY GOOD! Also really good service!  We'll definitely be back!",

We needed something fast since I have a 2 month old and we were in between feeding sessions.  The food here seems much fresher than the Buffet at Asia counterpart on Rainbow.  The salt and pepper shrimp were large and seemed fresh.  The Mongolian style pork chops and beef and broccoli were tasty.  The stir fried green beans and mushrooms were also done well.  I'm pretty sure it isn't sea bass as labeled but there is a steamed white fish, clams, imitation crab salad on a scallop shell for seafood options.  The fried chicken wings were also tasty. I don't do sushi...well because it's $9.99 and that is just plain scary.  I also did't taste the clams but mom thought they were still a little sandy.  Overall, I'd probably come back if I was craving some fake Chinese food.  This also isn't as busy as Buffet at Asia but I kind of prefer it that way.  Service was good, plates were picked up immediately.  Also not the cleanest place but by far cleaner than Buffet at Asia.",

They had a pretty good selection of foods in their buffet line, from the chow mein to the orange chicken, the cod filet to the chicken wings. The food was pretty good, especially for the price you pay for it. I do recommend the clams. It was like in a black bean sauce of some kind but really really good. The crab legs were also good, although skinny. If you're looking for gourmet Chinese buffet, you would not get that here. But on the mood to have great Chinese ayce that would get you a bang for buck, then this is the place.",

My boyfriend wasn't feeling that well after we ate here last night, but just brushed it off since some places we go, the food quickly moves through him. I however felt fine for a few hours until I was about to go to bed and the pain started. I don't know if it was food poisoning or what, but it was bad. Maybe this was just a one time thing, I don't know, but I'm not really wanting to find out.   Breakdown of the restaurant (aside from me getting sick). The place isn't very big, but the have a decent selection of food items. The desserts could use a little work tho. There isn't anything that is that great to choose from. They have a lot of seafood items which is why I wanted to try the place because that's usually most of what I get. For $15, you can't really beat the price to get crab legs, shrimp, claims, mussels, crawfish, etc. The staff was very attentive and picked up our plates and refilled our drinks quickly. I can see why people give this place good reviews, but getting super sick from eating there has definitely ruined my experience.",

Came here because my cousin wanted something cheap and a place that had everything from seafood to some fried chicken. We were about to go to buffet at asia but saw another yelp review that said this place was better...and cheaper. So had to.   It was pretty empty when we got there, around 4pm so I guess people were just getting off work because when we were leaving it was filling up fast. So get there before 5pm to be safe.   Also on the being empty part, I was a bit concerned about it due to food just sitting and not being replaced.  That wasn't the case here. They kept putting out fresh food and taking out older ones.   They had crab legs, fried shrimp, sushi (which I never trust at a buffet), chow mein, and the other usually Chinese food with some pizza and fried chicken.  The only bad part was the stale desserts.",

The steamed fish, stir-fried clams and the spinach dishes are always my go-to. Everything else is pretty good but these 3 are best. For quick Asian food fix, this beats Panda or take-out shops any day.   Him: The fish here is amazing. The flavor is nice and light and it breaks easily when you eat it. It feels like it flakes apart. You don't have to really bite it. They have good sushi too. It's not like other sushi restaurants, but it's still just good. I like the noodles too. It tastes like the Chinese noodles I like with extra onions which means extra-flavor. Only go for lunch. Don't go for dinner like other people do who just go for the crab. I like crab but they have skinny snow crab and it's too weird because it doesn't have much flavor or meat like Dungeness crabs. Bathrooms are yucky like most Asian restaurants.

The crab legs were super budget and only had a tiny bit of meat in it, the oysters and shrimp were \"water logged\". The choice and servings of \"sushi\" were so miniscule that it doesn't even count. Some things looked really good, but the flavors just weren't there. The chow mein was more like brown spaghetti. Several choices (actually too many)of items that starred imitation crab. The salt & pepper squid was ok. I meant to try the Broccoli Beef, but forgot. The seabass was tough and chewy. Some could say the you pay for what you get, but we've gone to another Asian buffet that was a little less and lots better.

The entrance doors are very dirty and the stalls show that they had not been taken care for some time. I recommend to the staff that they designate some of the personnel to address the issue's as these conditions could led to loss of patron's ....",

My friend also wanted to try because he heard rumors about this place.  I must say I was a little disappointed because they used to have anime scrolls on the walls and different anime series.  So I miss seeing them on the wall.  I wonder why they took them off the wall?!?!?  Hmm.....  Anyways, past is the past and it's time to move on.  Their sushi is the bomb.   They have more variety of sushi then any other asian  buffets I went too.  Customer service is excellent.   They always make sure your drinks are always filled.  Your never going to be left thirsty. I'm definitely going to come back here again.",

    "text": "Another Asian themed buffet in Vegas...doesn't hurt if the food is alright to pretty good.  This Sahara location is conveniently located on the West Side of Las Vegas, just off South Summerlin on the hustle and bustle along the Sahara Strip of business galore.  If any of you have been to Buffet@Asia...you are pretty much getting the same perks if not better.  The atmosphere from the outside appearance is clean and fresh.  Once you get in through the doors, the array of food welcomes you.  It has been strategically well planned as far as layout goes. Spacious in both seating and food arrangements.  The place is surrounded by windows gathering natural light and makes it more welcoming than Buffet@Asia (if any of you have been there you will know what I mean)    Price wise...it is a little cheaper than Buffet@Asia, but almost the same in price.  This is not your Todai or Makino's gourmet Asian Buffet, but you will have plenty of selection to choose which will be enough to satisfy the cravings.  I myself am a fan...who wouldn't mind going here every now and then.  If you are in the area...check it out.  It's more of a hit then a miss.    Don't forget to try their Mochi Balls (sesame)  they are a great snack/dessert.  Nice and warm, light with a bit of sweetness.  Pretty good than most places. :)",

The food here is definitely not 5 star, but for less than $10 dollars at lunch you can't really complain without looking like a total cheapy.  If you like crab legs, they do offer them for dinner. I must warn that you will spend more time cracking them and picking out the meat than you will eating. The legs are also pretty tiny. The price is still very reasonable for the crab leg dinner buffet, but not really worth it if you ask me. Everything else on the line is pretty much the same from what I remember, and the crab legs just weren't awesome.  If you want to (over) fill your tummy while keeping your wallet full, Krazy Buffet's lunch special is the way to go. :)",

Still lots of choices--potstickers, chow mein, fried rice, sushi, all the requisite Asian items, plus pizza and french fries. Desserts aren't too exciting, but I like the fried donuts. And there's always the fresh fruit. The service is good--your used first plate is magically gone before you get back with the second! For me, the variety is the draw so I give it four or four and a half stars.",

The food is all cheap and the $12 dinner price point is still too expensive. They may try to lure people with the crab legs but they are almost uneatable. As cheap as this place is run they would be able to turn a profit at 6.99.  Two stars because it's still a buffet for about 10 bucks although after tax and a 2 dollar tip you're at 15. Even the lesser expensive Vegas casinos buffets are better than this place.",

Their items were fresh and and the customer service was great! (5 stars)   I discovered this place across the street from my place of work and tried it out with a few co-workers.  They had a pretty decent self serve sushi bar.  Seafood was fresh and that is all that really matters to me when it comes to sushi.    Let's just say i liked this place so much that i wanted to make sure they were consistent with their food service.  They are consistent every time!

Today she and I were running a few errands and since she was driving, decided she wanted to eat at an Asian buffet for lunch.  We knew of the place Krazy Buffet on Sahara Avenue in Western Las Vegas and had been there before. So there we went.  I am still trying to figure out the \"Krazy\" part. Is the \"Krazy\" part the blatant mispelling of the word crazy in the name?    The food was average at best. The servers brought us drinks, and cleared plates from the table but beyond that, nothing. Cost wise the bill for the two of us was between 22 and 23 dollars. Not bad at all considering we are in Las Vegas and buffets liter the city.  But even the fortune in my cookie was boring, \"You are interested in public service and would make an outstanding statesmen.\" Oh really?   Sorry, just another buffet in Las Vegas, nothing crazy or even \"krazy\" here.",

Well, my mother and I are huge fans of cheap buffets with great food and especially seafood! This place was about 25-30 minutes away from home, but we don't mind the drive if we get to try something new.  When we came in (around 630pm) it was pretty busy, but we were seated as soon as we came in, which was awesome that we didn't have to wait. There's people that complain about how old the place looks and the seating but I didn't mind it at all. That's actually not something I really care for anyway when I go to eat somewhere.  They had a WIDE variety of food. Sooooooo much. I don't think I can eat for another two days! Their crab was delicious especially with the hot butter. They are SMALLER crablegs than what you'll get paying $20 bucks at a casino buffet but it's all you can eat so what does it matter? It was hot, delicious and sooo worth the $12.49.  They had so many different foods to choose from and it was of good quality. I'm not a massively picky eater but I can be and I really enjoyed eating here.   *I did try crawfish for my first time here at Krazy Buffet and I just didn't like it at all. It was the only thing that I had that I didn't like. I am pretty sure it is just the crawfish itself and not the buffet.*",

    "text": "This is honestly not a bad deal at all for an $12.99 AYCE.  For that price, you get crab legs, crawfish, shrimp, clams, mussels, and probably 40 other dishes that are all decent to quite good.  Plus, you can use the coupon for $5 off the bill!  Only exception was the sushi section where I thought the nigiri were not quite up-to-par.  Service was typically stiff but very timely.  Here's what I liked: - Crab legs were great, and unlike most places not salty at all.  Only if I saw that giant pot of melted butter earlier... - Seasoned crabs also, which I did not have but mum said was good - Raw oysters!!!! - Crawfish was yummy, they put some type of seasoning on it that was great.  As with any steamed crawfish, it's a pain-in-the-ass to eat though. - Mussels in the mayo-based sauce was great, mussels were plump - Clam in some type of garlic(?) sauce was also great - 4 types of soups - miso, wonton, hot & sour, and egg drop were good - Several flavors of ice cream - Fried bananas were awesome! - Mandarin orange - the canned kind, but I love those - The apple strudel-looking thing looked really good, but did not have room in my tummy   Didn't like so much: - As mentioned above, stay away from the sushi - Desserts were not great.  I had the cream puffs and they were awful. - Fried rice tasted like the ones at fast food places, not Chinese restaurants - Overall Chinese dishes didn't look impressive   With at least twice as many good as the bad, and with the goods being so much bigger in stature, this place gets big ups.  4-star food, not quite, but 4-star deal, it is.  Table-for-1 Factor:  It's a buffet, not a good idea.",

Great price and they have crab legs!\"  So I told my husband about it and we just had to get it out of the way and check it out.   My co-worker was right. $13.99 for dinner buffet. All you can eat crab legs along with all you can eat cream cheese Rangoon!   It was great to see kids eating seafood, cracking open their own crab legs and not being picky. My husband and I watched a guy at a table that only ate crab legs. We think he went back at least 3 times and coming back with 2 plates full. I enjoyed watching a grandmother and her two granddaughters tear it up. Eating more than the $14 worth of food. My husband enjoyed about everything.   And customer service; they made sure our tables were cleaned and are drink cups filled.   For $13.99, I don't feel bad about not eating so much versus a buffet at one of the hotels on the strip where I pay anywhere between $25 to $45.   Good food, good customer service, family friendly price gets Krazy Buffet 4-Stars.",

That being said-- as far as Chinese buffets go. This one is definitely my favorite! The Chinese food here is super good! I mean, don't come here looking for sushi or something fancy. But if you like creamy Crab Rangoon's, perfectly grilled chicken skewers, savory chow mein, crispy French fries, bomb diggity broccoli beef -- this is the spot for you.  You can compare it to Panda Express. Wait--- except it's unlimited, the food is not drenched in grease, and you can finish your meal with ice cream. Hm, I guess the only similarity is the price ;)  If you're craving a variety of Chinese food-- which I know we all eventually do at some point or another. Check this place out. You won't regret it.

The manager or one of the male hosts greeted us right away and we were seated immediately.   I was pleasantly surprised by the variety and selection. They had four soups-egg flower, hot n sour, miso, and wonton. They also had a sushi station. I rarely get sushi that's been sitting out from a buffet so I can't comment on the quality and taste. There was also a salad and dessert bar and of course lots of Chinese food.  There's no way one can try everything here in one sitting. Out of the foods I tried, I liked the steamed clams in some delicious sauce (no idea what's in it but it's good), seabass, chicken wings, and coconut chicken in a creamy sauce. I didn't try the salad bar because I went for the main courses. Their dessert selection is alright. I grabbed a cream puff, chocolate mousse, and soft serve ice cream. Our waters were filled and plates cleared so no problems with service.  This is a steal for $8.79 to satisfy your cheap Chinese food cravings. There's a 10% off coupon on their website but I was embarrassed to use it because my coworker made fun of my coworker for using it last time so I didn't. LOL.",

I was really annoyed with the fact that a member of my party was literally back to back with the server every time they stood there.   They need to fix their ice cream machine. You fill up your cone, just one wrong turn and the whole ice cream slides off the cone. Such a waste, the ice cream is terrible McDonald's serves better.  What really set me off was when I went to the restroom to wash my hands. I turned the sink on and in 2 seconds scorching hot water came out and burned my hands. I don't think I was the first person to experience that there. Made me want to leave ASAP!  I'll never be back, another reminded why I highly dislike places like this.",

You will definitely not go hungry here.  I would like to go there more often if I could. The only negative is that they give free parking but no equivalent benefit for transit users and allowed someone to open carry a firearm in to the restaurant. This should not be allowed except for law enforcement and those with concealed carry permits. It does not make for a comfortable situation while you are eating. The restaurant may ban open carry patrons from entering if they wish. These last 2 items are the only reason that I did not give them a 5.",

The manager caught a patron \"picking\" at the seafood dishes, and warned him not to do that next time.   Large selection and choices, average rating, quick dish replacement, pretty cheap deal for lunch. But, like I said, my husband didn't like it (so I don't think that we are going back). We were celebrating our nephew's birthday. Our party was split into three or four tables. Clean dining area- tables & chairs, the booths were on the side.",

    "text": "For a local buffet that's quick for lunch or dinner, the place isn't bad. The only issue I have is during dinner time. I've been here the total of 5X's. Every time I've been here it's been a war when it comes to getting Crab Legs lol. I swear it's like a battle of who gets there first. The other issue I notice is the amount of Crab Legs they actually brought out. By now, the Buffet should know that everyone's here for the Crab Legs. Granted you have to wait & be patient. But by the time they brought it out, it's only a small amount. So the first ones that are there reaps the whole tray. I'm not sure if this is there way or conserving there stock for the upcoming days but I don't get how you charge for Dinner time knowing Seafood (Crab Legs) is part of the cost per person. Then again, you have those that stacks there plate up to the roof with Crab Legs and have the audacity to come back and get more lol. Oh well.",

    "text": "If you are craving Chinese take-outs, but don't want to limit yourself to just the usual 2 or 3 items, then head over to Krazy Buffet down by Sahara and Cimarron.  This Asian buffet serves up decent Chinese foods that are typically sold at Chinese take-out outposts throughout the Las Vegas valley.  Plus they have a salad bar, small sushi rolls station, desserts, and in the evening also dish out crab legs, oysters (maybe oysters are served all day. Never been here during lunch).  And the price is fair for the food they serve (10% off discount ads can often be found in local publications).  I live fairly close to Krazy Buffet, and the parking lot area in its immediate vicinity is always packed with cars during meal time.  On most of my visits, including this past Easter, the restaurant was filled with a lot of patrons.  But service was still good (drink refills and clearing the used plates are taken care of staff that patrol their assigned sections).  I am not much of a crab legs person at these buffets (just don't feel like getting my hands dirty), but at nights that is the thing everyone else goes for.  But the kitchen is pretty good about making more to refill the near-empty trays with leggy reinforcements.  Raw (Olympia) oysters are also served (not sure if this is available during lunch), which are also very popular.  The sushi is okay. Definitely can't compare them to the ones you order at Japanese restaurants.  But you are also not being charged $25 for their AYCE sushi option. The seaweed salad is great, and is just like the one served at all the other Japanese restaurants.    The steamed fish with soy and scallions is my favorite item in the hot Chinese food section.  Get some steamed rice or fried rice, get a few pieces of steamed fish and spoon on some sauce and you are good to go.  Sauteed Long Beans, Honey Walnut Prawns, Chinese and Mushrooms, and Fried Sesame Balls are my usual favorites at Krazy Buffet.  If you are new to this eatery, try those.  Other highlights:  crawfish, fried chicken wings, coconut fried shrimps, mini-meatball skewers, Korean BBQ ribs (hit and miss), .  If you planned ahead and saved some room for desserts at the end, you can make your own pie a la mode, or go crazy with the Krazy orange slices, canned fruits, jello, or have some fried plantains.  Krazy Buffet is perfect for all of these occasions, conditions and more: 1)  You have a large party and a limited budget. 2)  General Chinese/Asian food craving. 3)  You are hungry and generally indecisive, but still gotta eat. 4)  Have family units to feed, but no time to cook or you can't cook or you burnt the Stouffers Lasagna (or forgot to turn on the oven). 5)  You are Krazy for buffets. 6)  You want to carb up Asian style before the next 10K. 7)  You are seeking restaurants with plenty of veggie options.  8)  Your Chinese heritage compels you to come up with lucky 8 number of reasons to convince others to check out Krazy Buffet.  Food:  4/5  Great selections. Generally pretty good.  Price/Value:  4.5/5  For AYCE crab legs, the price of admission is very reasonable.  Service:  3.5/5  Drinks are refilled automatically and dirty plates cleared by house elves.  But just like the famous Dobby, a little demonstration of monetary appreciation for services rendered is appreciated.  Parking:  3.5/5  You should park further to walk off those extra calories, but there will be plenty of parking spaces before you get to burn off a single calories.  Rounding up to 4 stars!",

The service was most impressive. As soon as my plate was empty the server swooped in and cleared it from the table. My beverage was never empty either. Great experience. Not one negative here.

Yes it's a buffet and reservations aren't necessary. But we wanted them to be prepared for our large group. They seated us immediately and we started to eat. This has your typical Chinese food items...chow mien, beef broccoli, hot & sour soup, etc. plus lots more. They also had a salad bar, sushi station and dessert area. All the items were pretty fresh and hot since it was busy and they were expecting us. But flavor wise, like I said earlier, pretty typical. Nothing really stood out as amazing and we just ate what looked good. One thing that I did enjoy was the sweet potato tempura, which I got seconds of. The servers cleared our plates as we ate and kept drink filled. At $8ish per head for lunch, you get what you pay for. Standard Chinese. The end.",

I guess I am still waiting to discover some good food, this place has plenty of seafood, but it is a buffet.  The quality is OK at best, the servers were very unhappy to be working, and the treatment of our group showed it.    Is this a place I would be returning to, NO.  The staff tried to keep the place where the food is clean, but they also needed to keep the floors clean and the bathroom needed serious attention too.  The cost is reasonable, but it was funny because after coming here I was hungry an hour later, and yes I did eat well, just did not want to push anything that was smelling not fresh.",

We came in at 8:30 on Friday night and they close at 10. They started taking food off the buffet at 9:15 and asked us to pay so they could close their register at 9:30. When we said we'd pay when we were done eating he got angry and said they were closing and that everyone else had paid so we needed to as well. And when we asked why they were taking the food away so early they said everyone was done. Uhhh, no we aren't!! They were so rude and this is the second time we've been through this with them at this location. The location on Cheyenne is much better with better management and better service and they don't treat the customers like this and close 45 minutes early and ask you to pay before you're done eating. We won't be coming back. Didn't get our money's worth at all, and don't appreciate being rushed to pay while eating with 45 minutes left before closing. Horrible customer service!!!",

There is no to minimum rotation of selection. This includes sushi, 4 types of soup, pizza, seafood, asian inspired beef & chicken dishes, dessert, various fruit & salad bar, etc. That said, it's not THAT bad. They do switch out the food often, and they clean everything well.  I don't exactly have a positive or negative opinion of the staff. They do their job, but I don't think I've experienced anything that notable.  Since I've been coming here for so long, I am sorta impartial to this place. Which is reflected in my 4 star rating.

For Comparison, The setup is almost identical to Buffet Asia on Rainbow and they have most of the same foods, but at this Buffet the seating is much more comfortable and feels less cramped which is definitely appreciated.  The quality of the food I found to be very good and I enjoyed every bit of it.   The prices are very reasonable and very comparable to similar places in the area so it is most certainly a great option for a quick filling lunch at a low cost. For those of you that are wondering, I wouldn't consider this a truly gourmet Chinese restaurant of course but it has all the classic favorites and I believe you'll definitely be satisfied.

We were seated right away and asked how old the girls were. 12. This made sense, because 10 and under are a few dollars cheaper.  The booth was reasonably clean and the restaurant was about half full. We all went up for our first plates, and the food is ok. About what you would expect for a $10 buffet. Nothing was great, but everything was hot and the buffet area was clean. The sushi was pretty mediocre but the kids enjoyed the fried rice, noodles, and orange chicken.   When we sat down, another server came over and asked how old the girls were. Again. 12.  The person who originally sat us came over again and asked again. 12. At this point I realized what they were worrying about and told them that I understood the girls were be adult price.   Ok.   We went back up for more mediocre food and sat back down. Again, someone came to the table to ask how old the kids are. TWELVE. ADULT PRICE. The restaurant has kids all over, so this is not a novelty. The two waitresses then stand a few feet from the table giving us evil eye and talking loudly about how the kids are too old for kid prices.   I KNOW.   By now even the kids had picked up on the hostility. We all worried together about asking for water refills, got real brave and went for it, and were rewarded with heavy sighs and eyerolling.   It was an ok lunch, at $10 a head (ADULT PRICES. I KNOW), and probably would have been worth a visit back except I am kind of terrified now.",

This place is just 4 miles from my way back.  For $14.99 (weekend price) I was very impressed how fresh their seafoods and other Dishes are. And and... they have fresh oysters!! All you can eat oysters!! Crab legs, crabs, claims!! Lots of choices!! Although they don't have the gazillion other choices like the seafood buffet at Caesar Palace, but they are $30 cheaper. In my opinion, their seafood here is fresher than Caesar! Don't expect 5 stars decor or tons of desserts, just a few, but hey, I am here for the seafood!!

    "text": "This is my current cheap Asian buffet champ...I've had numerous visits through the years, but after my current visit on a busy Saturday night warrants a review..  Krazy Service:  Party of 14 and we were able to get seated under 15 minutes, one table for the kids and another for the adults.  Our server kept all the drinks fresh throughout the night.  She stopped by at least every 10 minutes it seemed, very cool.   Krazy Buffet:  All the items you'd find at panda express and your local mom and pop Chinese restaurant you'll find at Krazy buffet.  Add in some seafood, sushi and some soups and you have a lot of options to choose from. Here are my favs at Krazy buffet:  Beef & mushroom- The beef was very tender and flavorful. I went up for 3 plates, and this found it's way on my plate all 3 times.  Cream cheese rangoons: Tasty and lots of cheese were in each rangoon.  Pork Bun - Flavorful and packed with more pork than I expected.  Honey Walnut Shrimp - Perfect blend of mayo and honey.  This is an easy dish to mess up and they do it well here.  There's not much ambiance as the dining area is designed to pack as many customers as possible which I don't mind.  For a $13.99 dinner buffet, Krazy offers some amazing value for the quality and selection of dishes you're offered.  If you come here with reasonable expectations for the price, I think you'll leave satisfied.  If I lived on this side of town, I would definitely visit more frequently.  enjoy!",

The other decent size mini crabs as listed in my picture was good but it's mostly unavailable due to they refill it rarely.  The octopus was good so the buffet was 3 stars at the this point.

There's a gazillion buffets on or near the strip and they wanna go 25 min out of town? Must be special I thought.  I get there and its an Asian/Chinese buffet. Not impressed. Even the decor was non descript. I was dreading eating there but I did it for my aunt. Pleasantly surprised, the food was actually OK. Nothing special but there's the standard fare. I was surprised there was honey shrimp, crabs, and prawns as the higher cost items. Service was fine.   Mostly locals eating here. The best thing about this place that bumped it to 3 stars is the just under $13 price tag for dinner. I am not sure how they make money.  Not worth the drive but if you're in the area (maybe to visit the ridiculous number of car dealerships) then hit this place up.",

We went in at 3pm and it was $9 per adult till 4pm. We thought the offering might be thin due to the time but they had everything. The place is not that big and the furnishings, decor and restrooms are well worn and tired. The service, well, it's a Chinese buffet so don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed.   The food was salty as expected but still pretty good. They were placed in small trays and rotated often. Everything seemed fresh and nothing was terrible. Overall, we were pleasantly satisfied and stuffed ourselves appropriately.   Resist the urge to go for the oysters on the half shell and crab legs they start bringing out at 4pm for the dinner menu and you won't have the rude experience of having the manager come to your table to tell you that you'll get charged the full dinner price of $13. A woman at the table next to us nearly got into an argument over that one. And, skip the soda. It's a buffet for Pete's sake! Whattaya doin' getting filled up on soda and paying extra for it?!",

Since we were planning for the $90 Sterling brunch the next day, we decided against two pricey buffets back to back. A quick Yelp search revealed that this was the closest Chinese buffet. Lunch prices went until 4, although note lunch does not include crab. Took about 13 min from Red Rock Canyon.  Overall, very impressed with the food and service given the very reasonable prices. The food is what you would typically expect at a Chinese buffet. A lot of Chinese dishes, soups, sushi bar, some American items such as pizza, salad/fruit bar, dessert and soft serve ice cream. Note that this place did not have the Mongolian BBQ station that some Chinese buffet places have. Not premium food and can't compare with the nicer buffet in Vegas, but at around $11 each after tax and tip we were all impressed.  Plus the service was friendly and quick, and bathrooms were clean. Great find!",

There was a lot of dishes to choose from and everyone was able to find something they enjoyed. Too bad we didn't go for dinner because they would of had crab legs!

    "text": "This was our first visit and it is about time as my curiosity for the last few years has been going wild every time we pass by and see a packed lot.  I used to live just a block from here approximately four years ago when they were building Krazy Buffet. I had moved just prior to their opening and wondered what affect it would have on one of my favorite Chinese restaurants just down the street (Bobo China).   I was in the mood for Chinese and we were very hungry, wanting to resolve our lunch and dinner all in one shot.  The place is clean, has comfy cushy booths, lots of variety of food to select from and great staff clearing tables and bringing drink refills.  The food was good, not bad and not great. The sushi was better than usual buffet sushi which is usually horrid. I enjoyed the stuffed mussels, orange chicken, fried rice, fried shrimp, coconut shrimp, sushi, meatball skewers, pot stickers, cherry bananas and coconut macaroons for dessert.  Mmmmm those pork meatball skewers were packed full of flavor with a drizzle of BBQ sauce on them. Yummy. I could sit and just eat a plate of those balls and be satisfied.   They have a great salad bar as well which was super fresh and had all of the toppings and dressing you could want.  My hubby really enjoyed the super big juicy chicken wings fried to perfection in a delicious light batter.  This visit did the trick, we came we ate and we conquered.  Their building was built new and looks nice on the outside however the inside of the restaurant was dumpy looking with old booths.",

    "text": "I don't know why we somehow always end up at a Chinese buffet at least twice a month.  Maybe because it's cheap?  Maybe because there's a lot of selection?  Maybe because I like to risk a bad tummy ache?  It's probably a combination of all these things.  We usually end up visitin Krazy buffet because of the coupons...yep!  I've been able to find them almost weekly in some of our local neigborhood papers.  Not only there but you can sometimes find a coupon in the online version of the Las Vegas Review Journal, they have a coupon area on the website.  The coupon we use is good for 10% off lunch or 15% off dinner.  Or is it 15% off lunch and 10% off dinner?  I can't recall right now.  Either way, with lunch being only $6.99 and dinner being $10.99 (all you can eat seafood none the less) it's not a bad deal if you're pinching pennies or want a change from Panda Express.  That coupon helps, especially in our broke-A$$ economy.  The selection is not bad, but for myself I prefer lunch items over their dinner items.  I say this because darn near all their lunch items are served at dinner, with the exception of the addition of crab legs, sometimes a steak option...and sometimes fresh oysters.  One night there might be oysters but the next night there might not be.  I know, it's a bit of a throw off so check the buffet line at dinner if you really want oysters!  I prefer lunch because I don't eat that much crab legs, and I'm not all that hot on oysters so for me the savings of $4 is worth it.  The selection of food is pretty good at Krazy Buffet (there's more choices though at Buffet @ Asia) and they keep things pretty fresh.  Their operation is also clean, which is a big plus for me.  If you read my Buffet @ Asia review you would know that they have some sanitation issues (but why that doesn't stop me from eating there I don't know..I'm guessing it's their awesome garlic fried wings).    Anyway, they have a lot of your typical dishes you would find at a Chinese buffet.  They have the requisite orange chicken, beef and broccoli, and fried rice and chow mein.  They also have things like sauteed mushrooms, steamed tilapia, teriyaki chicken, coconut shrimp, stir-fry veggies, and pork chops.  There's a sushi station but I kinda stay away from it because nearly everything is California roll-ish and not particularly great.  They have a decent salad station with fresh lettuce, fresh veggies, and a large bowl of shrimp for shrimp cocktail.  The soup station is limited, mostly your Chinese staples such as egg drop, won ton, and hot and sour soup.  They do have miso soup sometimes which of course is Japanese.  Krazy Buffet does have an array of fried foods (yah of course) that has fried chicken wings, egg rolls, chicken skewers, sweet and sour shrimp, sweet and sour pork, and even some Chinese doughnuts.  Most Chinese buffets have pretty basic dessert areas, and Krazy Buffet is no different.  They have pre bought almond cookies, fortune cookies, chocolate cake, carrot cake, and some smaller dessert stuff.  But they do have fresh fruit like strawberries, cantaloupe, honeydew, and canned lychee.  Of course there is a soft serve ice cream machine with vanilla or chocolate.    Overall, not a bad deal for under $9 for lunch, tax and tip.  Especially if you got that coupon.  It's not a revelation in culinary arts, but the food will keep you full for 2 hours or so...like most Chinese food does for some odd reason.  Clean and efficient, not all Chinese buffets can achieve that.  I just wish their fried chicken wings were as scrumptious as the ones from Buffet @ Asia on Rainbow!",

Krazy Buffet--with a name like that, I was instantly sorry I forgot my camera and phone. But the food proved to be decent, fresh (lotsa ppl = plenty of turnover on the food), and sucha deal! At $7 for lunch (less for the folks, since they're on the AARP train), we were able to nab the bill and look like good kids, without much strain on the wallet.  Everything I had was pretty good. Pretty standard Chinese fare, with a bit of sushi as well. Not too greasy or heavy. I'd go back next time, except there's a million other places to try!",

They have this oyster soup that is to die for. The honey walnut shrimp is scrumptious. Decent sized CRAB LEGS!!! Shrimp cocktail and oysters. Even the chicken wings are good.  You got to try this place for yourselves. I'm sure you'll find your own favorites.",

I didn't have a single dish that I would consider good and I tried fried rice, lo mein, mapo tofu, beef w/ broccoli, a spicy chicken dish, some pork dishes, steamed dumplings, egg rolls, crab rangoon and pretty much every dish except the mixed seafood one.   Even the steamed rice and basic things like wonton & hot and sour soup were not very good either. Panda Express is a lot better than this place. For the same price as this buffet, you can go eat at Ping Pang Pong which is the best Chinese food in town. Don't waste your time.",

Lots of different offerings including plenty of fish and shrimp.  The all you can eat crabs legs were good, but a little small.  They had a good selection of nigiri and sushi, and it was the best buffet sushi I ever had.  But don't go for the sushi alone, because this restaurant really shines at the tried and True chinese staples - sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, garlic shrimp, etc.  I was also suprised by how good the service was.  I will be recommending this place to friends.",

I was there at their grand opening with my family and I just wanted to leave after I sampled some of the food they have. This Chinese restaurant represents one of the worst on my list. I'm Chinese and I cook myself, so I know more than a thing or two about what has passed through my taste buds. Krazy buffett is a disgrace to the Chinese food, it's anything but Chinese. Why the one star? Well, my 13 year old daughter threw up soon after we went home and I was quite sure it's because of the food poisoning! I won't eat there even if they pay me.",

    "text": "I have eaten here regularly over the last year or so, Just started yelping so it's time to give them a review.  The time a day you go to this place really governs the quality and the freshness of the food in my opinion. I notice that when i go during the lunch hours, the food always seems the freshest.  Krazy Buffet is a pretty good place to eat at ,during my experience there today and on other occasions ,I have noticed that  the staff there really  seem to be concerned with the comfort level of the customer- Making sure your drinks are full- Making sure the food is good- asking if the temperatures OK-- But not overly did or annoying - really more so in the sense of being observant-  I appreciate that kinda stuff.  They have a large selection of Chinese and Japanese food to pick from. Ranging from sushi , noodles , sea foods  , fried rices, vegetables,coca-nut flavored chicken, soups, desserts -ect- - They also have a small selection of typical American likes--- like pizza , french fries ,ice cream , salads- ect.  The price seems to very as expected depending on what time of day you go. The same goes for the food. During the day the typical price is about 10 bucks and at night time depending on what kind of foods you desire- like crab legs for instance-- the price could reach up to 13 bucks-- But hey it's all you can eat.   Any way I'm going to give them an overall star score of 4, because the food and the service have  been pretty consistent during every visit I have had, and for me that matters the most.-- Consistency.   Hope this was useful to some one . ENJOY.!",

For dinner, which starts at 4pm, they add crab legs & oysters... Just be sure to bring your patience with you because some of the servers dont understand english, are kinda rude, and it gets so packed with people who bring their little kids, and let them run around unattended while yelling and screaming, as if the buffet was a personal playground.

Everything was standard Chinese food which some items were beyond inedible. I mainly stuck with crawfish and crab legs. The Chinese food is a step down from panda express. I tried the shrimp, fried rice, oysters and beef, so that I could say I tried it. I don't think I would get any of those items again. Stick with the crab legs! Also, what bothered me a bit and deterred me from getting some items were that some of the customers are gross. They were using the tongs to get the items and then throw the tongs with the handle in the food. Or they would throw the tongs on top of the food so that the handle was in the food. Gross ass customers that have no manners or courtesy of other people's health. I don't know where your nasty hands have been nor do I want to even guess. What is the point of using the tongs to get the food! Might as well as have had your gross hands in them to grab your food. So, I decided to pass on the items that had the handles sitting in the food. Anyways, overall, I give this place a 2 stars for having crab legs for the price of what I paid for and the service was friendly and quick! However, I'm not sure if I'll be back again, unless I absolutely have to..",

There were certain items that I had to pack my plate up with since they were my favorites!   The place was bustling and packed on a Saturday evening at around 8:30pm - but we didn't have to wait, we were quickly seated at a booth when we walked in. The food kept being refreshed since there were a lot of diners- this is a great thing!   They have a decent selection of Chinese goodies and other asian flavors.   I ended up with a plate stacked with cream cheese wontons and gyoza...Somehow it seemed like the right thing to do. They were so crispy and gushing with cream cheese goodness. So bad yet sooo sooo good! They make them very good here.   Plus their sweet and sour sauce and gyoza sauce sealed the deal! I'm a saucy girl, and I dunked my gyoza and wontons like there was no tomorrow. Super yummy!   They had oysters on a half shell that were cleanly shucked, tasted sweet, and didn't get us sick after eating... That's a huge plus in the books!   The crab legs and butter with lemon was a hit for me! (Only served at dinner)   The vanilla soft serve was creamy, sweet and a perfect ender to the gorge fest!   Here is a list of everything that I could remember from the buffet: (trust me, there was a ton more)  Frog legs Oysters Fried chicken  Bbq pork bun Sweet and sour pork Honey walnut shrimp Teriyaki chicken skewers   Orange chicken Shrimp cocktail Gyoza sauce and sweet and sour sauce  Baked mussels  Steamed clams Fried dough Fried wonton chips Beef broccoli Steamed Seabass Chowmein Fried rice  White rice Egg drop soup Hot and sour soup Miso soup  Wonton soup Sushi bar Salad / cold bar Fruit Vanilla Soft serve ice cream  Some baked cake selections Pizza  Remember this isn't gourmet fine dining! This is greasy good ol' buffet style Chinese fast food! The price is right, take it for what it really is. :)",

Sometimes you want to go to a buffet nearby your house and not be stuck in a long line or have to sign up for a players card, well Krazy Buffet is the spot.          I've been to Krazy Buffet more than once and I'm never disappointed. The service of the staff is pretty great. They all are very friendly and have smiles on their faces. I love the fact that 2 adults can come and eat lunch for $8.79 a person. Not bad. There a variety of food to chose from mostly Asian but you will also find your basic American food too (i.e. pizza, french fries, chicken wings etc.). I suggest you check out this spot! Can't beat it.",

The food had this unique texture I think its what you call stale . the food price was weak .",

    "text": "Just a brief review of one of my local and often enjoyment resturaunts.   The location is by no means subtle, easy to find, and the crowd varies depending on the days. Weekdays are a prime time since it's relatively calm, and the food is definitely abundant. Speaking about the food (Obviously?) It's absolutely phenomenal for the price you are paying, drink prices aside.  That was the good, now to the bad.  The food can often be, well very underdone. Given the price you pay, I wouldn't expect much further than that. The crab legs are really where it's at, so that's definitely where the value comes in to play. It's often a hit or miss, the crab can often smell rotten or somewhat decayed, given the obvious smell of ammonia, which is very strong at times.   Unfortunately i did once receive a horrible case of food poisoning several hours after, which out me out of work for 3 days, and all I had was the crab legs then entire duration of my visit. That being said, I'd take care in cracking open that delicious crabmeat, by inspecting and smelling the meat prior to consuming.  On a other note, I'd stayaway from the Nigiri.  3 stars for the locality, often great food for the price, and the friendly atmosphere.",

The food ran out quickly, especially the crab legs. They would be gone within 5 min or less. I managed to grab a plate but was very unhappy with them. I couldn't even break them, they had no meat in them really. I did not understand why everyone else was so obsessed with them.   Pretty much EVERY thing else was worth eating though. It all had good flavor and was warm. The buffet isn't huge but they still have a good variety of stuff. I will definitely return when I'm craving a good Chinese buffet again!",

Otherwise, a lot of these so-called All-You-Can- Eat Chinese restaurants have Americanized Chinese food selections. There's not much of those authentic Chinese food. Krazy Buffet is no exception... BUT it is patronized by many (not by Chinese) for their seafood selections like crab legs, oysters, mussels, clams, etc. The dessert section has a very few selections though but with a full stomach, I doubt if you still have a room to spare for that. Price is cheap, around $14 for a Sunday brunch and dinner. The waiting staff are very attentive. Lastly, you get 10-15% discount when you show them a Krazy Buffet discount coupon on your smart phone. No need to print it.",

Sitting down at our table another owner was staring at people , like they dont trust anyone , really !!!! We went for Crab leg / Oysters Sun. night. The crab legs are small , spindly , and not worth it. Waitress had her back to the wall and would stare at me all night. If I looked her way , she would look away.

I would say 95% of the offerings was seafood, which I don't eat. The \"meat\" looked questionable and I was scared to eat it. I wound up having french fries and green beans. The teriyaki chicken looked like rat on a stick. Nothing was even presented in a nice fashion. Place is old looking and needs a paint job. There are lockers in the dining area, yep gym lockers, why I don't know. Silverware was the cheapest quality (dollar store) and the plates were cheap too. Save your money and go to Panda Express where everything is delicious, and better quality.",

I was surprised by how many different dishes were offered. Let's just say, even though the quality wasn't AMAZING, I wasn't upset about it for the price I was paying for my meal.   SERVICE: 3/5  The service was pretty good here. They refilled waters as needed and came to check in on our large group (we had about nine people in total). However, I sometimes felt rushed by certain servers. The service wasn't outstanding, but it wasn't bad. I think they served us well overall. They also didn't charge us an automatic gratuity, which was surprising because it seems so customary now-a-days.   AMBIANCE: 2.5/5  The ambiance is fine. It is pretty mediocre and doesn't really add or negate from the dining experience as a whole. I wasn't super impressed with it overall, but it was good. I didn't think the place was extremely tidy or clean-feeling, but I still liked it.   PRICE: 4/5  For about $13.99 per person, there was a good variety of food to choose from. I can't complain. They are also running coupons in the newspapers and such in the area, so you can always use those!   LOCATION: 4/5  It is easy to find and there is quite a bit of parking. It is right on W Sahara and you can't miss it (unless you are going too fast).",

We were hardly tended to. The worst part is this woman who worked there had the nerve to tell us we had to tip. She never stopped by our table and she verbally said \"you didn't tip on the receipt.\" Which is funny because you know she was paying attention to our party but never attended to us. She was very rude but we were forced to tip. I always tip because I use to deal with customers in the food industry and tips were great, but there was absolutely no reason for us to give a tip. My day was great till I came to this place. I don't give bad reviews either but they deserve it because my family was in town and this place and their service ruined our night.",

The only thing i didnt like is every time i go here they give you the check while you eat and don't even ask for it. Other than that it is a decent back up spot.",

I guess it's because we ate here all the time back then. Well, for my birthday I told them I wanted to eat here, while my wife's mother also said she wanted to eat here again, so they reluctantly agreed. And what a change of heart they all had, my family had nothing but praise for this place, from the server, to the food and price, everything was great. It's still a great asian buffet after all these years.",

I was a little scared at first to eat the food when I saw it. I was invited by my family. So I kinda of had to go. I will never eat here again. The only thing that was good was the service.

I've been wanting to go there on a Sunday for a long time and today was that day we had some family coming over to visit so we decided let's take them to Krazy! We have gotten good service there lots of times and I've recommended to some friends to go try it. Well today we did not get very good service...1st We came in I requested a table for 4 I had to repeat myself 3 times. 2nd the guy that sat us down and asked us what we wanted to drink was kind of rude I asked for a strawberry lemonade or whatever kind of lemonade they had, he aggressively answered NO! Only pink lemonade... that is not how you respond back to a paying customer at all!(I think he might of been a supervisor/manager) And 3 when one of the servers came to ask if we needed refills I said yes...everyone but me got a refill. It took a while until someone finally came over to give me a refill. I don't know what's going on but we don't usually get bad service. P.S. It doesn't hurt to smile!",

Our busser, Ming, was always circulating and making sure all of our needs were met with a smile and a thank you.

We ran in for lunch today, and the experience was one I wouldn't mind repeating, which is saying a whole heckuva lot. I generally avoid buffets at all costs, but this one offered me plenty of green items, a good tofu dish and absolutely perfect sesame balls filled with red bean. There were even plantains! Every chicken dish I sampled had a great flavor, and all of the servers were smiling and clearing plates lightning fast. When we visit buffets, I keep track of how many items I am compelled to spit out, and I am happy to report that there wasn't a single item here that didn't pass the test. I didn't love the spinach or the green beans, but they were not overly salty or flavored poorly. They were simply plain.  Is this gourmet? No. Is this healthy? Probably not. It is a Chinese buffet with an odd sushi section, congealed salads on the fruit bar, and pizza, but in that world, this is a pretty good option.",

Don't go then and eat at a restuarant where you are expected to tip. I would recommend this buffet to anyone wanting good food and clean restuarant.",

The crab looked old and it did not taste right! While the shrimp they served was mushy for some reason. The only thing I enjoyed was their noodles otherwise everything else basically sucked! Their sushi was so salty that I had to drink some water to get rid of the taste. 11.99 down the drain!",

    "text": "This place is Krazy. It was unexpectedly very good. It could just be my expectations were low to begin with, so even average food exceeded my expectations.  I've driven past it dozens of times but never considered trying it because of the name. That is until one day I was craving crab legs and searched Yelp for a decent seafood buffet. Krazy Buffet popped up and I figured for a fraction of the price of a casino buffet, I'd give it a try. I was nervous about eating here (I mean, what can you really expect from a place that misspelled crazy?) But I was surprised at how good it turned out to be.  First I should mention they only have crab legs for dinner which starts at 4pm. If you paid for lunch and stay around for the crab they will charge you extra. At least that's what the sign says.  Anyway, the crab legs were just ok. I don't know if they were frozen or pre-cooked, but the texture seemed a bit squishy to me. But hey, it was still worth it because it's crab! We ate so much crab I think they were happy to see us leave.  The selection of other items was pretty good. It's what you would typically expect from a Chinese buffet. The items that stood out to me were the large steamed shrimp with shell on (a bit bland but very fresh), clams, meatballs, tiramisu, and strawberries.  Service was great. Everyone was so friendly, they kept our drinks full and our table clear. Obviously a buffet is self serve but the employees here are much more pleasant than some expensive high end restaurants I've been to. I'd recommend it for a cheap meal.",

The food isn't so great here, as everything was so greasy and the way they served the food looked a bit shady to me.  The coconut chicken was pretty good, but not the greatest.

The wait isn't that bad depending on which days you go, but it does get crowded.   One last tip: try the sesame balls, I'd eat those as dessert. :)",

The selection was pretty good for a mixed asian cuisine buffet.  They had a small selection of sushi rolls (non were labeled as to what kind of rolls they were, which I did not like.)    Every other food item was clearly labeled and nothing appeared to have been sitting too long.  All of the food was pretty good, better than many other chinese buffets around town! There is a selection of 4+ soups which is great too.  My friend had the hot and sour and did not enjoy as it seemed like a mix of hot and sour and eggdrop.  The wonton soup was tasty however, and the fried bread with sugar was a great dessert item!    I left full and would go again. The price for two with soft drinks was under $25.",

It's old, booth was so far from the table, I had to sit on the end of my butt. Eating utensils were very, very think and crappy. Plus, I thought it was kind of expensive for Las Vegas standards.",

Me and my fiance' have joked about this place for quite some time, just because of the name.  Seriously, \"Krazy Oriental Gourmet\"?  Huh?  What the heck? I thought oriental referred to rugs now?  Maybe I'm wrong, not sure.  Anyway, we finally decided to give it a try about a month ago now, the first time, hehehe.    It was so darn memorable the first time we went for lunch, I had to get me some more!  AND...I spotted that they have crab legs at night, and I'm a crab crackin' fool, LOVE me some crab!  The crab was nice, hot and fresh.  Thecooked veggies are amazing!  They even have a pretty nice salad bar and soft serve for dessert.  Plus it very clean.  I leave a very happy camper :-)",

They have a wide variety of food including crab legs (which I went there for), shrimp (boiled and fried), beef spare ribs, mussels, clams, oysters, some yummy seabass, and even sushi (which I have eaten more than a few times and have never been ill :-) ) The cost is $11-12 per person depending on if you have a coupon or not which you can print off of their website. Cost of the drinks are extra. Overall, highly enjoyable and I would and have gone back.",

So I asked the guy by the cashier and He told me, well we just got in and they are still cooking. I thought when you close at night you clean first so it's gonna be ready in the morning.

    "text": "I ate at the Krazy Buffet for lunch on a Friday.  It was busy but always had a table open for people streaming in.  I was seated promptly, my drink order was taken quickly and I helped myself to several dishes that had shrimp and found them to be of average flavor and not anything that was over the top.  The chicken wings looked cooked perfectly but had no flavor...none...they were hot temperature but bland even though they looked good.  Their Hot Sour Soup was good but lacked that vinigar(?) flavor.  I tried small portions of several dishes and did not find anything that was so good that I would go back for, but none of it was \"bad\".  My drink was refilled quickly, however, I was puzzeled by a sense of invisibility while eating there.  No one asked if my food was good or if I liked what I was eating.  The wait staff spoke Chinese to each other and I think my dining experience could have been better had I been acknowledged or spoken to.  The overall rating of the food would be average or 1/2 a point below average.  I try to find positive issues when rating buffets,  as these places have a low margin of profit, and deserve fair and impartial comments.  So with that being said,  the place had ample parking, clean eating area, sufficient dishes to satisfy a lunch crowd that wants quick service, inexpensive food to cure the hunger and be on your way.  Should I eat there again, I will update my review.",

Well whatever the case is, for $10.99 a head for dinner, you will get your money's worth after having 4 oysters.  Yup, read 'em and weep.  They are KRAZY to charge this amount of money for all this seafood  That includes some pretty tasty snow crabs as well.  Oh how I love thee seafood!!!!  Bathrooms a wreck though.  2 stalls only, but one is out, equals disaster.   Pretty large selection of Chinese food, but all of it tends to be on the oily side so I stay clear of it.
