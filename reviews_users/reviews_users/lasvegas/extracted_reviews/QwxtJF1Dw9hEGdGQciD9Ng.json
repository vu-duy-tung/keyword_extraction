I have been to Catch NYC and i loved it so that's the reason when I saw there was a catch in Vegas I booked immediately. Food was great, love the catch roll, the tartare trio and the octopus. We had to move tables because ours was very wobbly.",

    "text": "We were told by a friend that we should try this restaurant in the Aria Hotel. From the very second we entered the flower covered entry, we were blown away by our experience at Catch. We made the decision to sit at the bar because we did not have a table reservation. From the very second that we were greeted by Jacob, we managed to turn one drink into several appetizers, dinner and a wonderful evening. I typically eat out 7 days per week because I am single and I travel extensively. Jacob is by far one of the best bartenders I have ever met. His passion for food, drinks and customer engagement were very clear to us. He was also extremely honest about what we should and should not order. We came for one drink.......we stayed 3 hours and ordered half the menu. We will definitely be back and you should try Catch.",

Problem is that it seems they didn't hour enough experienced servers for their opening.  Our guy was not on the ball at all and we spent more time waiting on drinks and food than we wanted to.  Once the orders were in, though, it was a non stop small plate avalanche and there was nothing bad.  Highlights were the sushi rolls and ceviche.  We ended up re-upping on yellowtail nigri.    The prices and quality of food meet our expectations but the service fell short.",

    "text": "Our waiter was amazing! Every time I'd even glance at him he'd know that I needed something. He gets a 5 star.  Food was delicious -- specifically the Lobster Mac & Cheese... so yum! Just the right amount of creaminess for being a seafood based mac and cheese.   Sushi and raw seafood -- meh! Unique flavor for sure but I could barely finish it. I've had more enjoyable sushi for the same price. The Tartare Trio was particularly underwhelming, the chips we were given with the dip were bulky (and quite gross to me in my opinion). The dip was fine but I wish it went in my sushi or something. My friend liked it.   Dessert -- we only go the \"Hit Me\" Chocolate cake and it was good! Just the right kind of richness I seek in a chocolate cake.  Drinks were great -- I would avoid the Lush Lemonade unless you're craving diabetes (or just ask for less sweetener maybe). I wasn't having it so my waiter replaced it and I asked for a Grapefruit Spritz instead -- AMAZING! My friend switched her drink for mine because she liked it so much (or maybe she just hated hers so much that the Grapefruit Spritz was a blessing that washed down all the terrible after tastes, who knows)!!!   The music -- SO LOUD!!! I'm assuming they're playing loud music to incentivize people to let loose (party and buy drinks), and I guess it worked(?) Many people who were having a casual dinner night looked so over it.   Obviously the scenic setting and bold marketing is what gets people in here -- I applaud Catch for that. However I think that means that it is time to specialize in a vaster array of sushi. As a high-end restaurant on the Las Vegas strip I expected better specialty sushi options. There is still room to grow!",

Every time the waiter wanted to take my order he would tap me on the shoulder. Although it was quite loud in the restaurant, I have never experienced a waiter touching me before. Also, we had a large party and instead of serving me my drink from my side, he served it from across the table over 2 people to give it to me and also did the same for my husband when giving him a spoon. When I made reservations they asked if it was for a special occasion and I said that it was for a birthday. The waiter never even asked us about it once, so what was the point of asking us when we made our reservation? Finally, the waiter brought the bill and placed it next to my husband while we were still eating desert and didn't even ask if we wanted anything else. When we were leaving we complained to the manager about the service but he didn't even seem to care.",

Was really fresh but meh.. then came the salmon belly carpaccio and the beet salad which was amazing! Followed by the Best octopus I have ever had over crispy potatoes. We had the \"Catch\" sushi roll which they run a torch over at your table.. then the Waygu beef and filet skewers that were to die for!  We finished the meal with the Donut Wonder Wheel for dessert.

My companion caught our waiter roll his eyes at me after I incorrectly named an item on the menu, note our menus were already taken away at this point and I'm pulling this off of memory. I also noted on my reservation that the dinner was for a birthday in case Catch did anything for birthdays. I assumed they didn't since at the end of our dinner, we were just given the tab but I noticed someone else receive a slice of cake for her birthday. I'll give the benefit of the doubt and assume maybe there was lack of communication between the hostess to our waiter or maybe you have to purchase a birthday dessert. I highly doubt it's the latter.  Overall, I would love and wouldn't mind dining there again. I just don't want to be served by our waiter again.",

Sorry food was so amazingly good I didn't even take photos of them.  But, here's a photo of the entrance with my friends!",

Then they have a time slot on the table I sat at of only 2 hours and then they collect the table back. It was extended after we were waiting for our food to arrive to our table. The waiter seemed really busy that she couldn't be as attentive as she needed to be. She also didn't listen well, for example  she assumed one of my guest no longer wanted the dish he ordered. So she never put it in for the kitchen to prepare it, in all once the food arrived. It was like a explosion to my taste buds and my guests the food totally made up for the service. I will go back but I pray that the seating time is faster than what I experienced this time.",

The only complaint I have was how I was greeted (this explains the 4 stars). When I arrived to check in, the girl (Asian) at the front told me I cannot bring in my child under 6. She said I should have seen the policy when I booked through Open Table. She never asked me how old my child was, but assumed he was under 6. I told her my boy is over 6 years old, she looked at me and asked again. I had to reassured her that he is over 6. Then she gave me a stare and told me to wait to be seated. I went back to look at Open Table policy and saw the age policy is 5. I am not sure what was her problem, but I do hope the hostesses do get better trained on how to greet and welcome the restaurant goers. Plus, they should know the policy before enforcing it.",

    "text": "Service was good to a point. They're not allowed to split the check which makes it hard for groups of individuals who don't know each other to come out even. Food is apparently \"family style\" which means it's intended to be eaten by the whole table except it's only enough food to be split between 5 people at most. This is probably why they don't split the bill. I was impressed by some of the flavors but none of the execution. Lobster macaroni is flavorful but served with tiny noodles, they need to be larger and thicker. The salmon and crab sushi was all crab and the thinnest slice of fish. The chicken polo dish was all breading. The steak was absolutely phenomenal but it damn well should be at that price. The donut dessert is akin to what you get when you order Chinese delivery. Drinks were drinks, nothing special. Music was loud so don't expect to be able to talk to anyone except the person sitting next to you. There's a unisex bathroom that you'll have to make a quick go at before some drunk girl jiggles the handle and then bangs on the door for you to move it along. Atmosphere is pretentious but we expected that from the new place in town. Honestly I think the only reason this place is so talked about is bc they have a photo opt location as you walk into the place. Influencers aplenty have walked this same hall, enticing us to come hither and be seen, yeah f that lame bs. Valet is $30 to park and that doesn't include tip for the actual valet guys so keep that in mind. No discounts for locals or parking validation after you just spent $750 at a dinner you didn't particularly enjoy. Anyways, good luck, hopefully you'll enjoy yourself more than I.",

Everything pretty much has Asian flavors which were interesting. I couldn't find an app I liked since I don't care for sushi so had the Brussel sprouts side as an app. They were very good with a miso vinegarette sauce and an adequate portion. My husband had a spicy tuna roll which was very fresh. For dinner I had the bronzino served over rice. The bronzino was about 1/4 inch thick and about 6 inches long.  It was tasty but overpriced. My husbands red snapper was over cooked. Service was good - very attentive but when we drop $200 for dinner we expect a meal we are impressed with and an atmosphere to remember. Also, Catch is not owned by Aria so we wanted to apply casino comp and they gave us a hard time. No one tells you many of the restaurants in Aria are separate despite the fact they can charge to your room.",

The host (who had been employed three months earlier according to later knowledge) asked him to leave his wine before coming into the restaurant. My father decided to leave it. He then overheard the host calling over the manager (I wish I could appropriately describe him, all my father said that he was short in stature) and talking about him. The manager then decided to kick my father out of the restaurant (because of his one glass of wine?). Without asking what had happened, no hospitality WHATSOEVER, the manager turned away a customer that would have spent $$$$$$$ at his location. So sad, because we were looking forward to this location. Whatever you do avoid this place until they find better management. Joke of a place, especially in the Aria.",

    "text": "I was in Vegas over March Madness weekend, and wanted to have a nice, but casual dinner. After reading the reviews on here, I was hesitant at first, but my friend who was going to dinner with me wanted to try it, so I made the reservation for a 6:45pm dinner on a Saturday night.  The first thing you notice when going in is the amazingly beautiful walkway. I'm not one for social media posts, but it definitely was ig/snap worthy. We arrived about 45 minutes early hoping to get seated early cause we were really hungry. The hostess said they couldn't seat us just yet, but they would get us in as soon as they could.  My friend and I sat at the bar and the bartender was pleasant enough. We ordered two shots of 1942 and two soda waters. The 1942 at $40 each was pretty reasonable for Vegas pricing, but we were charged soda water, from the gun, $4.50 each. I couldn't believe it. We weren't there for long, maybe 10 minutes, until we were seated at our table. You'd think we could just carry over our bar tab to our dinner tab, but we had to close out.   So far the experience was unpleasant, but we came for the food and not the service, and almost all the food we ordered was amazing!  First came the truffle sashimi. The tuna was better than the yellowtail, but the caviar mixed with the ponzu all came together really well. Next came the Catch style sashimi, which really wasn't sashimi, but slightly seared thin slices of salmon. My friend and I both agreed that if the salmon had been sliced a little thicker, it would have been a great dish. The sesame seeds made it an overall win for me though.  For hot dishes, we had the crispy shrimp, lobster mac and cheese, and the king crab tempura. The crispy shrimp was my favorite overall dish from a bang for buck perspective. The portion size was great, more than enough for two people, and the cooked to perfection. The lobster mac was the 2nd best on the bang for buck, and had good flavor as wellZ Those two dishes alone, along with the earlier orders, put us in the right place. But we decided to go over the top and be stuffed so we ordered the king crab tempura. I wanted to compare it to Nobu's version, which I've had more times than I can count, and even the worst version I've had at Nobu was better than this one. It was such a hit and miss dish. The smaller pieces had great texture and flavor. The larger pieces had an overwhelming crab taste where to me it tasted like it was two day old crab. At the price point, it should be more consistent.   For dessert, we shared the sticky coconut cake, which was perfect for two people. The coconut sorbet was the perfect refreshing end to an overall good meal.   The dinner service was great at first, but as dinner progressed, it dropped. I can see how anyone who would come in for an 8pm reservation would hate the service.  Our dinner portion of the bill came out to less than $200 before tip, which was steal for what you'd expect out of Vegas. We were more than stuffed, and didn't skimped on out anything we wanted. Because of that, I'd definitely come again, but only for a dinner start time no later than 7pm, and ordering the same dishes, except for the king crab tempura.",

Made reservations about 3 weeks ago which I highly highly recommend you doing if you want to come here.   We came on a Tuesday night and it was packed. We were told to wait at the bar and a hostess would come get us. I admit was a bit of a wait but we managed to get seats at the bar and got drinks.   Service: was great! We were checked in regularly by multiple people. Servers were very knowledgeable about the food and drinks.   Food was so delicious. We got a mix of things to share. They were almost tapa style so think small plates.  The lobster mashed potatoes were probably our favorite. Chunks of lobster and the potatoes were so creamy and rich in flavor. It was a good kind of rich flavor. We also had the scallops and cauliflower which was perfectly cooked.   Crispy chicken bao buns were really good. The waygu tacos were legit. although they packed a tiny taco w the meat that it sort of fell apart by the time I picked it up.   We also got the catch roll with crab and salmon which they lit up. That was pretty cool.    I'd honestly recommend this place! It's definitely very different in terms of ambience and decor with other places.  The entrance is beautiful. I could totally see them changing it up throughout the seasons. Who knew artificial flowers and Xmas lights can completely change the vibes.   Great time and looking forward to coming back!",

The inside of the restaurant is quite large, larger than I would have expected. It is great for big groups. We had 10 and we were sat at a round table with a lazy susan in the middle so we could spin around our dishes and all get a bite! The inside is dimly lit and a louder more fun of an atmosphere.   The food was okay. I wouldn't say it was the best I've had, but I wouldn't say it wasn't good either. We had a chefs taster and it was fairly decent. Portions were okay as well. The cocktails were really great though, so I would suggest visiting Catch for a drink and to enjoy the ambiance. Our server was very nice and I liked that all the people who worked inside Catch worked together to help the tables and guests.   Overall, I had a very fun night out with friends and enjoyed myself here!",

Food was timely, flavorful, great presentation, awesome staff, and a beautiful atmosphere. Waiting on the hubby to stop playing craps so we can go again before we head to the airport! It is pricey but my experience was worth it to me.   First Visit: - Herb Roasted Branzino - Spicy Corn - Catch Ceviche  - Chicken Skewers (on the House, but could do without) - Catch Roll (could do without)  Second Visit: - Oven Roasted whole Branzino - Uni  - Spicy Corn - Truffle fries   They know what they're doing!",

It is a beautiful restaurant. The music was fast, upbeat and hip. The staff and servers were excellent. And the food...wow. The quality of fish (including sushi) was amazing. Our server Joseph gave us some great recs on the menu. I loved my experience there. It was truly fantastic",

Once you are here you forget about the time & are taken in by the beauty of what feels like a secret earthy hideout from the Las Vegas desert/Strip. My girlfriend & I booked a reservation for 8:15pm on a Sunday and were sat promptly on time. Our waiter had a very warmth soft spoken vibe & recommended the filet skewers, crab rolls & mahi mahi tacos. The portions were shareable and perfectly cooked although it did not seem like a lot of food my girlfriend & I were full off those three orders. Price was a little higher yet to be expected but nothing outrageous. We would certainly return here for another date",

    "text": "I've now been to this location twice, and the only reason I am giving it two stars is because both times the food was decent.   My first issue: there is no where to sit and wait while you wait for your table. The first visit I made a reservation and the two of us were seated without issue. However, on my recent visit we made a reservation and then waited a subsequent HOUR to be seated. So my question is, what is the point of a reservation then?   And when we are seated, our table was too small for our party even though they insisted we could fit. We did fit, but we constantly didn't have room for the shared plates we ordered and we had to store drinks and food on the shelf behind the booth which is incredibly tacky. Overall the service was subpar.   I won't be returning here. Yuma at the cosmopolitan has better food and better service. I suggest taking your Instagram pictures at the garden tunnel in front of catch, then walk over to Yuma instead.",

Initially you're greeted by the floral pergola! It's a dream to walk down this amazing creation and is truly picture worthy. Arrive a few minutes before your reservation to snap a few photos.   The dining area isn't as beautiful as the entrance and could use revamping.  Service is impeccable. Although we had multiple people bringing out our dishes I want to give a special online shout to Francis who was so helpful in assisting us with what we should order and was overall friendly.   Food that stood out: the Waguy beef that you cook on a hot rock., O-M-G melts in your mouth! Worth every penny! So flavorful. The scallop truffle gnocchi had incredible flavor I will dream of it fir a few nights to come, the king crab hand roll- DELISH, and the rock shrimp!   Will definitely come back to this place in Vegas!! Come see it for yourself",

We found Kat over in the well area and said hello and also met Jake who was great.  They both found a spot for us at the bar and we took up residence for the next 45 minutes.  My wife ordered the One Too Many and then the East-Coast Kali.  Both were great.  I went with wine which is my norm.    This was a fun time and we would definitely return.",

Thank goodness because I have been wanting to try this place.   The decor when you walk in is so cute with a lot of floral. Once we walked all the way in, the hostess greeted us and took us to our table about 5 minutes later. The restaurant and bar was pretty packed as expected for a Saturday night in Vegas.   Once we sat down our waiter greeted us and explained the menu a bit with us. Once we were ready we ended up ordering things to share:  Brussel sprouts - this was crispy, crunchy and soft all at the same time. The only thing I would say is it was a little too salty for me.  Toro sashimi - this was so good!! Just as toro should be, it was soft and almost melts in your mouth. Definitely a fresh taste.   Toro roll - the toro was good both as a sashimi and the roll. The roll just gives it more texture. So delicious.   Grilled spanish octopus - this came on top of some potatoes and the octopus was so tender and the flavor was on point.   The food overall was great and so was the service. Our waiter was awesome and everyone else that came to help him was good. I would definitely come back here again. The seafood is fresh, the service is great and the atmosphere is fun. Next time I'll come back w/my girlfriends.",

The food was delicious we ordered the grilled octopus which exceeded all my expectation the potatoes were perfect as was the octopus! The lobster Mac and nice a creamy, the macaroni was al dente and the chucks of lobster was really good as most lobster macs don't provide that much lobster! The sushi was lite, fresh, and very good.

The walk into the Catch is magical with greenery and lights. The front bar was a great place to have a few drinks before we had dinner.   Kristi was our server and she did not let us down. We didn't need a menu. Every suggestion Kristi made was amazing . We started out with the Truffle Sashimi.  It was out of this world!!!  Then we had Hellfire Roll - so good! After that we had Crispy Shrimp and Waygu Tacos, they were fantastic. Kristi then suggested the Hit Me for desert. Wow!!! What a great desert and fun to hit!!!  Can't wait to come back!! Thank you Kristi for an amazing experience.",

From the super Instagrammable entrance to the glowing bar right as you emerge from Catch's blooming tunnel, Catch is total eye candy! The place was packed on a Tuesday night and the music was bumping. Catch is definitely a happening spot. We sat down at the bar and enjoyed cocktails and appetizers (the hamachi with fried spinach was incredible and the gnocchi and fried cauliflower were just alright). I love the look and vibe of this place, and I will give it another try for drinks and order different menu items to get a better feel for Catch.",

The seating was very tight and we sat at a very small table, which wasn't great, but the quality of the food made up for it.  The food was definitely better than Zuma at the Cosmopolitan.

You can do much better for much less in Las Vegas.  Do not waste your time with this place.

We checked in the hostesses were lovely. The restaurant was bumping so we grabbed a drink at the bar while we waited for our table. I got the Detox Retox it was served in a little juice bottle which I thought was super cute. The hostess grabs us from the bar and we get seated. Then we get sent an Angel, Joesph N, he is probably the most beautiful man I have ever seen. He was tall with a scruffy beard and he had us cracking up from the second we sat down. We stared with the oyster shooters, the oysters tasted so fresh like the just came out of the Pacific Ocean.  Joesph then placed a wagon wheel looking thing on the table. I was like wtf we didn't order a wagon wheel. Then he put our next course on the Truffle Sashimi. What a delicacy! Truffles, caviar with a little bit of spice. Incredible.   We got a hell fire sushi roll. They even took a blow torch out to finish it off. What a unique touch. It was delicious and spicy   Followed by Cauliflower which I was blown away by. It tasted like a buffalo wing but they were VEGAN!!! Probably the first vegan dish that I could not get enough of.    Then we got a steak which was perfectly cooked and some lobster Mac and Cheese. Holy moly perfect combo.  To finish it off Joesph recommended the hit me dessert. I looked like a chocolate cake but he gave me a spoon and told me to hit it and I did. Out splashes our the most delicious vanilla creme all over the plate and the cake. It was so delicious I wanted to lick the plate  and Joesph clean .  Joesph was so graceful and engaging. He really Wow'd my guests and I.  Defiantly coming back",

    "text": "Serious issues with service from the door to the kitchen. We arrived 7 minutes before our reservation and we're greeted with a heavy sigh, \"you are early for your reservation so please wait in the bar area.\" The host staff looked stressed; heads down, shuffling chits around, two runners walking around like zombies with eyes that scream \"I'm dead inside.\" Not a way to make anyone feel welcome. There were droves of people standing around hoping that their table would be ready next. I would have appreciated a real conversation to let me know they were behind on their wait. They missed the mark with authenticity and genuine hospitality. Bummer. We were seated around 20min after our reservation, fine.  We were lead to our table which was a tiny two top squished in between two others on a banquette. I wasn't too worried about it, except that my chair in the isle could touch the chair of the person seated at the table behind me. The service staff had serious trouble reaching us without being in the way of each other. Basically, the same hectic \"chicken with head cut off\" vibe in the dining room. We got the standard spiel about food coming out as it's ready & a list of our servers favorites. This is lazy service, all the servers repeating the same blah blah blah all around me. Everyone loves the Brussels sprouts for some reason. Again, no authenticity. Very junior servers with little experience. When I ordered a bottle of wine, my server asked me to open the list to show him the wine because he needed the bin number to ring it in. Uh, can you do that in the side station on your own time? I didn't order some crazy thing I can't pronounce. Dr. Loosen Riesling, anyone who works with wine should know this producer.  The staff was all going thru the motions with noticable  pain. It seemed as though the host staff sat the turn all at once and everyone was rushing to catch up. The managers gave no eye contact, and in fact were texting in the middle of the dining room. One suit moved like a bull in a China shop, wrestling chairs around without apology.  I could not hear my guest, she could not hear the waiter. In fact all we could hear was the guy sitting next to us talking about his wife being the guard to Hades.  The food was comparable to the quality of any chain restaurant. Very unimaginative, in my mind I could hear the chef menu planning meeting going like this; \"whatever, throw lobster and truffle oil on it & they'll eat it up.\" Sad, boring, one note, simple minded, disjointed... While clearing our dishes, I mentioned that we didn't care for the last plate. We each ate one bite & left it sit. Our server panicked and with passive aggression immediately dropped the check with no follow up questions; no offer of additional drinks, coffee, dessert. I guess we are done. Bye.  I hope that the management gets inspired to lead their team with grace in a beautiful space with so much potential. And that it becomes a great place to work and a fun place to dine. I understand that a busy restaurant in Vegas is hard to manage, but when the guest feels like an inconvenience, we all lose.",

    "text": "The only reason why I'm giving this restaurant two stars is because our waiter was lovely and the manager handled our complaint very well on her end. The service was great but the hostess staff was terrible.  We had a reservation for 8:15pm and didn't get seated until 9:00pm. The hostess with the dark hair and tattooed arm was extremely rude and didn't accommodate us. We asked her when we would be seated after waiting for 20 minutes. She told us that she couldn't just kick people out if they're still eating, which I understand, but she said it with an attitude. After waiting for 45 minutes, we were finally seated. However, as we were walking back, we noticed that there were so many empty and open tables. We didn't understand why so many people were waiting if they had so many tables available.   I also waited a very long time for a drink at the bar in the dining area and there were only two other people there. I was getting ready to leave and walk back to the table, but the bartender finally came back and said that he didn't have everything stocked at the bar.   Now, for the food, it wasn't good. We ordered the mushroom spaghetti, lobster mac and cheese, new york strip steak, and the herb roasted branzino. We spent about $300 and the serving sizes didn't justify the price. I could've eaten a ribeye at Craftsteak or Mastros for about $58, while this place charged me $79 for a 16oz new york strip steak. In addition, I could've eaten a deliciously-seasoned whole branzino at Momofuku for $70, versus the filet of fish branzino for $48. The pasta for the mushroom spaghetti was overcooked. The lobster mac and cheese was missing the main ingredients...cheese and lobster. They basically turned the lobster into breadcrumbs and just sprinkled it over the macaroni.   Overall, the only good that came out of this experience were the pictures that were taken in the entryway. We definitely will not be coming back to Catch. It's not worth it.",

The steak was very tender and the corn was awesome. The service was amazing... David and Nina made the experience much more pleasant. They were awesome! David was very attentive, knowledgeable about the menu and had a friendly personality.  The only negative comment is that the tables are WAY too close together. You can hear each others conversations, and it is a bit awkward trying to slide in between tables to sit down.  Overall, great experience!",

    "text": "So, I was definitely interested to come to this place and see how the service was based on some of the initial reviews.   I'll preface this by saying I'm a Las Vegas local and I go to a decent amount of nice restaurants on and off the strip. I also come from a service background so I am picky-ish about service but I also understand what makes things go upside down.   What I can say is we had the best experience and everyone we came into contact with was fantastic, super friendly, and knowledgeable. The ambiance is great which I'm sure everyone knows by now. It wasn't too loud and the music was fun and upbeat. We were able to have a conversation and hear our waiter and bartender. The hostess was really friendly. We were 10 minutes late for our reservation which was at 7:45p and they said it wasn't a problem at all and they hold it for 15 minutes anyway. They had valet blocked off and said it was full so we had to drive around to self parking. The hostess escorted us to the bar to have a drink while our table was being set. I think this concept gets lost on a lot of people leaving these reviews. It's basically part of the dinner process and adds to the experience. You don't wait awkwardly in the hallways. If you do, that's your own silly fault. We waited about 10 minutes so we grabbed champagne from the bar, bartender was great, and took some photos. Obviously. You must get the obligatory Catch photos.   The waiter was really nice. He came over and explained the menu. I have been to Catch in LA so I was familiar but my boyfriend wasn't so the waiter went through the menu.   He ordered wine, I got the spicy margarita-ish cocktail. Both were great. The sugar rim on the cocktail was a bit much for me and made the whole glass kinda sticky so I just got a new glass. Quick and easy.   Truffle sashimi is definitely the best thing on the menu. Must try. We also ordered the Catch ceviche. Really good. The lobster in the dish was great. Lobster mashed potatoes were my second favorite thing. It's like lobster bisque but in mashed potato form. It's soooo good. We also had the toro sashimi. It's pricy anywhere you go. But let me tell you, that $9 bite is so worth it. Buttery and melts in your mouth. I kept the truffle sauce from the sashimi dish and dipped in that. Probably the best decision I've ever made. We also got the New York strip which they sliced for us. Really nice. Highly recommend this process. We had the yellowtail avocado cut roll as well and it was probably the best basic roll I've ever had. I dont know what they're doing to it but it was so good. I kind of judge restaurants off of how good their most basic food item is and this did not disappoint at all.   After our initial course the manager came over and asked if he could move us to a booth. They had a large party coming in and we were basically sitting between two large empty tables. I totally get it. The booth was an upgrade anyways since the tables are smaller. We gladly got up and they moved us over quickly. He brought us this amazing desert for the move. I'll take it! It had chocolate. Yes. Cake. Yes. Ice cream. Yes. Caramel. Yes. And it was Instagram worthy with the hammer/pouring process. Yes. The other waiter that brought it over advised to get the camera rolling. Lol. Love it.   Overall really great experience. Every restaurant has their funky opening and growing pains. I never try restaurants in the first month. So if you had a bad experience here, I encourage you to try it again.",

By promising items on the menu as vegan however using the safe oils and pans as meet items, many True vegans will be disappointed. Further more for a Sea Food resturant cross contamination seems rampant due to this same problem.

Mahi mahi tacos tasted like they were drowning in mayonnaise. Blech! Crispy shrimp, ceviche and chicken Bao buns were just ok.  Scallop gnocchi was probably the standout of our meal, but still, I wouldn't write home about it. In terms of ambiance, the room is too loud. And gets louder as the night goes on - while we were there music increased in volume twice. This combined with the general room noise made it nearly impossible to carry on a conversation with our table mates. Here's the catch on catch - the value for the dollar on this high-flying dining experience does not measure up.",

For dessert we had the 'hit me' chocolate cake. It's delicious and comes with a surprise when you hit it. We ate at the bar. It has TVs in the mirrors which is helpful for nights when big games are on. They also have a sushi bar to sit at further back in the restaurant. I suggest a reservation if you want a table.

The baby gem Caesar salad is probably the best Caesar salad I've ever had. The branzino was good, the steak was cooked perfectly, but the spaghetti takes the cake!! We ordered a second one because it was so good!   All the drinks on their cocktail list looked yummy. I ordered the East Coast Kali. The waitress described it as a spicy margarita with passion fruit. And spicy it was! If you like spicy, it's a real kicker, but the sugar on the rim really balanced the spice.   Overall, I had an amazing experience at CATCH. The walkway was absolutely beautiful. But there was one downside. It was extremely loud. It would've been nice to have the music softer, and not like the club. I almost asked for earplugs.",

There are many ways to take pictures, at least 3 different backgrounds. I could give 10 stars for the atmosphere alone but that is not the way it works. lol   We came exactly at 6:15 of our reservation. And we were quickly directed to the bar. Neither one of us wanted drinks so this was discouraging. After about 10 minutes, we were really hungry, we asked to be seated which we were. It would've been nice if we would've been seated right away though. The hostesses could be more pleasant. But, once inside, the waiters and busboys were super friendly & nice. This place looks hip & modern but the music is anything but. lol It goes from 80s, to 70s & then all of a sudden it's Oldies & Motown which we did not like at all.   As for the food, there were some dishes that we enjoyed, some were ok & one that we hated. The shrimp cocktail & lobster was good. Their cocktail sauce is excellent but the aioli has curry in it & is the worst thing I put in my mouth for a long time. There was also the scallop gnocchi which was awful. Very oniony and fishy with no scallops to be found. They took this of the check.   But, we also ordered a vegan \"crab-cake\" by mistake. We thought it would be a real crab cake but, it was a heart of palm crab cake, maybe they could confirm that the customer knows that there's no crab in it. We didn't know. Or maybe they could call it a \"heart of palm\" cake.   The lobster mac & cheese was just OK for me & could've used way more lobster. Finally, we got dessert, it was the S'mores dessert it looks very pretty & it is pretty good but it doesn't have any chocolate at all. Although, the marshmallows were roasted to perfection.   Overall, I would definitely come here again. But, it would be mainly for the atmosphere & to take pictures.",

Came in on a Saturday night w reservations, come to find out my reservation was actually for Sunday lol fortunately the hostess sat us anyways which was super nice.  The food and drinks we're so good! Loved the Bluefin toro and Spanish Mackerel nigiri, Wagyu gyoza, brussle sprouts and the #HitMe Cake!!  The only dish that we ordered n didnt enjoy was the crispy chicken baos but not a big deal. Our experience here was perfect. The food, ambiance, company (the couple sitting next to us was fun and nice to talk to) the staff, all so great. We'll definitely be coming back!",

    "text": "I've been here about 6 times and we always order the truffle sashimi, mushroom spaghetti, sticky coconut cake and the donut wheel. The truffle sashimi just melts in your mouth. The mushroom spaghetti is my favorite. Sometimes we order two orders of it! I recently had the New York Strip and it was so tender and juicy. I would definitely order the strip over the filet. The \"Hit Me\" cake is definitely something that makes a good social media post but it's too sweet and heavy for me to ever finish. I prefer the donut wheel which comes with chocolate, caramel and raspberry jam. And my favorite is the sticky coconut cake. It's a coconut sorbet with a hard chocolate shell and little pyramid shaped cake with a delicious mango sauce. Sometimes my boyfriend and I stop in just to get this dessert.  The service isn't the most consistent here and it also depends on where you're seated in the restaurant. I've noticed that when I've gone with a larger party the service is better than if it's just two people. Also the seating in the main dining room seems to have more servers than the bar seating area. I would highly suggest to make a reservation beforehand since the wait for a table can be awhile.",

The concrete jungle draped w/ vines greenery & lights as the infamous CATCH tunnel entryway there are plenty of photo ops for you& your party. The floral catch. The floral butterflywings. HELLO!    The hostesses need help! No, srsly! Numerous guests were complaining and the hostesses just drew a blank stare and said sorry to probably every group.  We were seated shortly after 8:30 meanwhile we sat at the bar I had champagne the others had rose. There are TVs at the bar & \"bar seating\" is available @ high tables surrounding the bar stool seating area. You really have to let the aesthetics of the entire venue soak in.   We ordered a variety of dishes. Ok trying to stop my mouth from watering:  Catch Ceviche- definite hit, w/ blood orange so refreshing juicy & delicious. Prime Ceviche combination  Jap Yellowtail Sashimi- (2pc) $10 was ok.  Crispy Shrimp- good, creamy, v crispy most shrimps this style lose their crisp this one maintains its crisp deliciousness!  Spicy Cashew Sweet Potato- a tad salty but so crispy & delicious. The kale. Wow. Fave!  Mahi Mahi Tacos- in wonton shells. were good.  Hit Me Cake- as it was my bday! I absolutely am a fan of chocolate& this GF dessert is all that & some fun!   Our server was wonderful & the service was wonderful they cleared plates & refilled beverages asked us if we were alright & the food was well worth the experience.",

I made reservations a week prior and when I arrived at the restaurant we were seated within 15 minutes of checking in. So definitely a lot better than what others have experienced.   My fiance and I were drawn to Catch because of the beautiful entryway; it is absolutely stunning when you walk through. We usually aren't too crazy about fine dining restaurants, but it was our 4 year anniversary so we decided to splurge.   We started off the night with the Truffle Sashimi, I thought it was pretty good, but I wish the portion was just slightly bigger. My fiance ordered the Sauteed Wild Caught Snapper and I ordered the Herb-roasted Branzini. I ended up eating her snapper and she ended up eating my branzini. I liked both, but I had a slight preference for the snapper. However, I would go for the branzini if it's your first time. We finished off the night with the smores pizza. I definitely recommend getting that! It was a great way to top off the meal.   Overall, I had a great time at Catch. The food and service were on point and the decor is amazing!",

I would recommend coming a bit early just to take pics before the dinner crowd comes. Since the entrance was so beautiful I was left underwhelmed when I walked into the dining area. The entrance and beautiful bar definitely took from the rest of the restaurant. Now, on to the hostess and employees...they are way super nicer than the LA employees!  We didn't feel unwelcome and our servers were very friendly. I have to admit the food here is waaaay better than CatchLA! Everything tasted so fresh and well seasoned! My favorite dishes are the hamachi and octopus. Yummy! I would definitely go back to just have those two dishes. The drinks were strong and tasty! I was left craving for more!!",

The lighting is absolutely perfect and all of your pictures (with flash) will look amazing!   The waiter said their dishes are family style but everything our table ordered was small. I ordered the chicken bao buns (3 for $25 or 2 for $19) and they were not enough to share, unless you ordered tons of stuff for the table. I guess it's supposed to be tapas style. My friends loved their sushi and drinks. We ordered Brussels sprouts but they were out, so we ordered broccolini instead...it had a super strong lemon taste.   The waiter was friendly but the restaurant was so loud, it was hard to hear him the entire time!   Tip: They won't seat you until your entire party has arrived.",

    "text": "Legit good seafood in a fun sort of speakeasy/old school/vintage vibe.  Went here for my wife's birthday. Initial impressions were good. Lots of friendly staff, cool atmosphere, especially the entrance (very Instagram friendly). Opens into a bar with friendly bartenders and nice open space, it got crowded later but didn't feel crowded...if that makes sense. Check out the pics, on to the important details:  Our server was super helpful, and the staff were very attentive, filling water glasses, taking away plates, however I did not feel rushed and nobody ever reached for a partially eaten dish. They utilize a \"streaming service\" so each dish comes out when it's ready, although they did a good job of timing so we never had too much on the table or felt rushed to finish a dish.  The food was very good, I'd say it is worth the price. It is expensive, for sure, but not outrageous if you are familiar with pricing in the casinos and honestly considering the ingredients, the freshness, and the variety I found it very reasonable. I would definitely recommend three small plates per person and skip the entrees. I thought the cold and hot were equally delicious. Highlights were definitely the truffle sashimi and the grilled Spanish octopus.  Cocktails all sounded very sweet when I read the menu, and I was hesitant bc I feel that strip casinos/bars tend to make drinks on the sweet side, however I found both our cocktails to be well balanced and very nice. Honestly these are some of the best cocktails I've had on the Strip.  TLDR: Definitely try this place, order a cocktail and two or three small plates and enjoy the cool ambience",

I called the same day to make a reservation for 2 and although I didn't get the time I wanted, it was really nice to even have been accommodated. I'm from NYC, I should have known better than to try to get a reservation the same day lol! The entrance is so incredibly beautiful, you'll definitely get the perfect instagram picture. We were then seated, and our waiter Miguel was AMAZING. He helped us with the menu, telling us his favorite dishes. He made sure we were having a great time and he is part of the reason why I have to say their customer service is 10/10!!! For an appetizer, we had the lobster avocado roll, which was everything with the sauce. Followed by, wagyu gyoza and finished with the organic crispy chicken. The hit me dessert was also really great. The only unpleasant part, was their hostess who kept looking at me up and down, it was actually quite rude. However, other than that, If I ever find myself back in Vegas, I will definitely be back but I strongly recommend.",

But you're in luck, if you want to have a meal but not want to talk to each other then this is the restaurant for you,  There's no way to hold a conversation in here. everyone is shouting over the music to have conversations. In photos, the atmosphere looks cozy and romantic, but once there, it's like your neighbor's blaring their stereo while your trying to sleep.  The restaurant look is reminiscent of a restaurant in a wine cellar. But the sound level is reminiscent of enduring a bombing during WWII. I might not make it to the main course.

I asked around and had heard great things, especially about their truffle sashimi. I was not disappointed! The ambiance was both beautiful and modern, as well as a speakeasy vibe within the lounge area. The colors, the subway tile, the chandeliers... all gave it a fun but classy ambience. The service was great, the cocktails were on point, and the fish was great!   The food is more or less served tapas style. The waiter suggested we choose two hot appetizers, two cold appetizers, and share an entree. My favorites included the truffle sashimi, the scallops gnocchi, & the MRC Roll. The entree we chose was the Red Snapper, which was plated beautifully and was tasty but honestly was my least favorite of all the things we ordered. Next time, we might just order 1-2 more app's. They also took care of me with a little birthday surprise--a few delish & fresh chocolate chips cookies.  Really enjoyed my time here! Definitely recommend!",

Long archway covered w/ floral. You'll find two slits to take pics--the butterfly wings and the \"Catch\" flowers  You walk right into their bar which has a speakeasy vibe. Then behind that their main dining room with a sushi bar and birdcage booths. To the right of the bar is a lounge that also has another bar and kind of library feel to me. Outdoor seating will come in the future.   Okay okay food. So it's a Japanese spot but they also got your steak and seafood. Yes very shareable. I'm just going to list my favs. Keep in mind it's will likely change since it's just opened.   -One Too many Cocktail -Crispy Shrimp -Branzino  -Mushroom pasta (must like truffle- my fav of the night)  -Donuts (I just thought about them..drool!)  Those stood out to me but other solid choices are the sweet potato gnocchi, filet, truffle sashimi, and eggplant skewer.   Service solid. Timing of food was normal. Music good variety of old and new. Not as loud as STK.   Needless to say Yes I would return!",

    "text": "Another Catch another disappointment. After going to the one in LA and being extremely disappointed there my friends informed me that the Vegas location was better. I asked what about it was better and they said the food because it's a different chef. In my mind it made some sense so I said sure let's give it a try. Both service and food were worse than the LA location. Our whole group agreed that all the seafood dishes from the rolls we ordered to the lobster Mac and cheese had an extremely fishy taste. We waited forever in between courses and had to ask for utensils and water more than once before we got it. With so many restaurants in Vegas and at Aria save your time and money go somewhere else.",

First, we were given a super small table for party of 7.  Second, the table was uneven so drinks were spilling and utensils were falling off.  Third, since our table was so small we had specifically requested the main courses to be served at different times since we knew the table would not fit.  Well, guess what? The chef didn't listen. Most of the main course came out at the same time where we had no choice but to reject some of it due to lack of space. Worst of all, the steak came out before the fish.  That was a total no no.  For a restaurant that prides themselves as the top, this mistake should not have happen.  Management needs to read all of yelper's comments and improve.  There are so many nice restaurants in Vegas.  If you can't keep up with the rest of them you will be weed out soon.",

We ordered two truffle sashimi, ceviche, king salmon, carpaccio, hamachi with Kale, charred octopus, Mrc roll, mushroom spaghetti, scallop gnocchis, broccoli side dish with the oven roasted branzino. We topped the dinner off with the hit me Klondike chocolate dessert and sorbets! Gosh, five of us ladies ate very well and we had nothing but high remarks!

The hostesses seemed short staffed when we walked in but they seemed relaxed and having things under control. We got walked in by Chey who was so sweet and acknowledged we were celebrating something special. She even made sure we were comfortable in our seat and explained the difference in menus she handed us. We decided on our food and they advised the chef recommends to order all at once and they will send out the feast as it is to be served. We got the sashimi, shrimp cocktail and oysters for appetizers and we were not disappointed ! They even had (mignonette) which is the white wine and shallot sauce for the oysters which was phenomenal! The scallops were perfectly cooked, and the filet was served with a spicy miso sauce. My all time favorite was the crispy Brussels sprouts, something so simple but made perfectly! Overall the service the was incredible. The hostess who sat us, was a welcoming hello and an attentive goodbye! Would defiantly recommend!",

Service: poor lots of errors on waiter, and the hostess played on there phones and he seated two walk-in's before our group with the reservation.   Would I go back? Only to take a picture of their beautiful entrance.  Disappointed by the food, and the service. Walking into this restaurant is like stepping into another world, it's amazingly beautiful and it makes it hard to write this review. I joined friends for a birthday dinner the other night and was very excited to try there food for the first time after seeing the yelp reviews everything looked so delicious! I ordered the snapper with lobster mashed potatoes and for $42 you would think they would have seasoned the fish it tasted as if it soaked in water all day the seared skin side down almost too long because it was almost on the dry side. The mashed potatoes were good but for the amount of money being dished out a bigger portion would have made more sense. No one at our table enjoyed there food, I even ordered a Jack and Coke and that was even off! And for this to be a birthday celebration the waiter never made mention of it being my friends birthday even though the reservation was for a birthday, the waiting staff was very rude in how the brought out our food reaching over our faces just placing food down on the table and walking away giving the wrong food to the wrong people. I felt very bad for my friend she deserved a better experience and better food. I will say the Crispy shrimp were very good, but Catch Las Vegas I have had some better food off of McDaniel's dollar menu then what was served to me Sunday night. Also if your wondering about atmosphere it's very nice I just wish the brought the entrance into the restaurant it was also very cold. For Aria to be such an amazing hotel you would hope for a restaurant to match that reputation. And before I forget I ordered my friend the doughnut wheel for her birthday as a surprise at the end and my \"amazing \" waiter in front of her asked the table for my name as he will charge the birthday dessert to my part of the bill thank you for the surprise! Then it took 25mins for us to receive the bill after asking for it and he mixed up our bill 3 different times I don't know if the Catch was having an off night but to make up for my friends disappointment I took her out somewhere else where we able to enjoy our food seeing that we were still hungry and enjoy one another. As a Vegas restaurant Catch you can just depend on the name and restaurant your LA location has be world class season then taste your own food and hire a better staff.",

I mean, the entrance itself adorned with flowers and foliage deserves its own yelp page ;)  The ambiance is lively with dim lighting and the decor beautiful. They serve very fresh seafood and cuts of steak. My favorite was the crispy shrimp dish, truffle sashimi, and the kalbi tacos. And make sure you order the chocolate coconut dessert! The servers were on point, our glasses always full, and our tummys very happy. Our entire office had an amazing time. Will be returning!",

    "text": "Ahhhh man! I was really hoping for this place to be better than we experienced. My husband and I are True Aria/Mlife supporters. We were really looking forward to this spot and even counting down the days until opening.   So on our recent visit to the Aria, we made a reservation for 5:30. The opening spot of flowers, entry way of butterfly wings with flowers, all that is gorgeous. I was a little bummed that it's all fake flowers but hey, it's for instagram and photo-opts, right?   When we walked right in, we were greeted with a hostess a little preoccupied with her peer-hostess. Finally, after a minute, we then were taken in but directed to the bar, since they were \"so busy\". How can they be so busy when they literally JUST opened? After ordering a drink, within minutes, not even where the ink was dry, a hostess waited for us to seat us. Already depleting the stars.   Sitting us down, we were given a row, one side couch, and other side chairs. The tables were literally two tops, 6 inches from the next. I found this so ridiculous since the restaurant was barely filled. They could really give more space between the tables. Why am I going to want to hear the chatter next to me? It takes away from the experience, ambiance and shoot, food! I had a couple or two looking at our table, seeing what we ordered and rather than being able to enjoy the last bits of it, we were in the middle of a conversation with the table that was six inches from us.   Service aside. Seating and ambiance aside ...  The food was just okay.   We ordered a seafood platter but it could be replicated at Herringbone. We also ordered some special appetizer roll, which was good at best. My husband ordered the scallops and I ordered the fish (not the whole). Husband's dish was okay, but he complained of sand and the components not being tied in together. My dish was okay, fish was cooked well but the basmati rice was over seasoned.   Would I support coming here? No. Save your money, go somewhere else.",

If you're looking for cute Instagram pictures and a pretty view when you're sitting down this place is perfect! Before you reach the hostess stand there is a beautiful display of flowers along the entrance. This is where everyone is mainly cluttered trying to get pictures before they enter. As far as the food goes...i really didn't like their food. I came here with my friend on one of our only nights off and i was so disappointed With the quality of the food. I got the lobster Mac and cheese and i barely finished half of it. I'm okay with paying a little more for good food but this was really gross.",

The seating is relatively tight, depending on your party size it could seem uncomfortable.  Food: It's a family sharing style, so we ordered a couple things to try. The crispy shrimp is one of the known dishes & it matched up to its expectations. Delicious   I also received the mahi mahi tacos..either 3 or 4 are your choices...,I should have gotten the 4. They were really tiny, but tasted amazingggg. Lastly, I ordered the lobster mashed potatoes. This was dissatisfying to my taste buds, it was extremely too thick.   Otherwise, drinks were good! Dining experience was good. I would definitely recommend & plan to come back again.",

The one thing that didn't align was hostesses, and to specify, the women at the front counter in the hallway of flowers. This review is based on them, and a mere blind eye being turned to this problem by the management at CATCH who is reading these unpleasant reviews.  My party and I made 2 reservations to CATCH, 30 minutes apart because we didn't want to experience the unapologetic and long wait time. Our reservation, which was for 6 at 8:00 PM and a reservation for 8:30 PM. We showed up and were awkwardly standing in the hallway for 30 minutes until our second reservation. I'm not sure how this is acceptable, to be ignored by hostesses. And frankly, don't have the energy to continue writing a bad review about this non sense.  Figure it out.",

The restaurant may have been a little pricey for a few people in my group, but everyone found something to eat that they really enjoyed. We ordered: spicy scallop roll, vegetable rolls, lobster and avocado roll, mahi-mahi wonton tacos, crispy chicken bao buns, grilled Spanish octopus, lobster mac, and the sauteed snapper.  My wife and I had the lobster and avocado roll, the octopus, and the snapper.  The lobster sushi roll intrigued me so I ordered it, and it was pretty good! Definitely a unique taste (at least for me); I've had plenty of sushi, but never with lobster.  The octopus was amazing! The highlight for me. I love getting octopus, but it's always a risk because it's easy to overcook and make rubbery. I'll say that Catch did a spectacular job at cooking it perfectly; it was tender and delicious. The potatoes that came with it were also delightful.  The snapper was a lovely piece of fish; succulent and tasty! I'm not personally a fan of truffle, and was happy that it wasn't OVERLY truffled, but instead had a little bit on the plate that you could use as you wanted.  Definitely would recommend this place if you're looking for an upscale place for dinner on the strip that has really delicious fish!",

There was hardly anyone at the restaurant when we show up, and we were told to go to the bar to wait to be seated. We ask 2 times when we would be seated, but the hostess kept telling us \"just a few minutes\". Finally, we send my boyfriends mom over to ask when we'd be seated, because by now, we had already waited over a half an hour (not as bad as most of these other reviews, but the restaurant was literally empty when we showed up, and we noticed the restaurant was getting full with people who showed up after us and we still hadn't been seated)!!! The hostess finally said she was seating us right now, and her excuse was, \"oh, I didn't know your group was all here.\" We literally notified her our entire party was there, and she saw all 4 of us, when she had asked us to wait at the bar. Why would we keep asking when we could sit to eat if we didn't have all of us there?  Anyway, our waiter, Raj, was excellent--5 stars for him! And the food was excellent. The hostess was just the only terrible part of our dining experience.  -Hostess: 0/5 stars -Waiter: 5/5 stars -Food: 4.5/5 stars -Service(based on speed of food coming out, water refills, changing out clean plates, wiping table, etc.): 4.5/5 stars -Atmosphere: 4/5 stars (the entry way is obviously incredible and unlike any other place around, the bar is really nice, the sushi bar is nice, but the restaurant itself is a tad underwhelming in comparison to everything else...)  We only ate appetizers but they were almost all really good with the exception of the lobster mac (eh...), lobster rolls (not worth it), and chicken ball skewers (others liked this, but it wasn't my favorite). These are the other items we tried and enjoyed:  -Catch ceviche -Catch roll* -Shrimp and mango roll -Filet mignon skewers -Cauliflower with some sort of sweet dressing* -Yellowtail nigiri -Eggplant skewers* -King crab tempura* (everyone thought was better than Nobu's) -Salmon belly carpaccio* -Corn on the cob* -Crispy brussel sprouts (great flavor, but I expected the leaves to be peeled off the brussel sprouts so they would be really crispy, but it was the entire brussel sprout so it wasn't that crispy) -Crispy chicken bao -Donut wheel  *These were my favorite items  Overall, I would come back for special occasions, but I really hope they improve the whole hosting situation for people who show up early with their whole group when the restaurant is empty and have reservations.",

It's loud and super trendy, also really dark, I thought it would be hard to get noticed (we sat at the open tables in the bar), but our server and the rest of the bar staff were quick to take care of us and provided the best service.

Must have: truffle sashimi, crispy shrimp, and hit me cake it was amazing.( they do not do anything special for birthdays- you need to order a desert and they will put a candle on it lol) kind of disappointing they can't even give a free desert on birthdays when your spending so much money.   2 stars for inside scenery: the outside of the resturant was wayyyyyyyyyy nicer than the inside. Inside was boring, and plain. Walking in I was expecting something else it was like two total different environments.  4 stars for service: our waiter was great very accommodating and knowledgeable, however we felt a rushed to order everything at once.   Overall it was an okay experience, guess I was expecting a little more since it's so hyped up. Would recommend to try, but probably won't be going back. I prefer Nobu, Roku, or TAO",

    "text": "Came here opening night with a group of gals after visiting both locations in NYC and LA. Sooooo... high hopes!! And then BOOM right off the lobby you see this snazzy, cavernous floral tunnel. Fountains and fairy lights and flowers up in this bitch! CATCH is hot and CATCH knows it. The bar looks like a sexy Metro cave, in a glamorous/post-industrial way. You'll get those vibes in the main dining room with the birdcages covered with vines with hanging cable lights and subway tiles. The ambiance is just so killer here and perf for Aria.  Okay sooo the good stuff. Literally everything we ate bitchin' with a capital B!!! Let me take you on a wild, front seat ride on this culinary coaster baby.  Crispy shrimp: Little delicious orange nuggets of goodness. Creamy. Crunchy. All that good stuff. Catch Style Ceviche: Came apart like sexy, fluid, warm butter. Hamachi Spinach: Crispy spinach and yellowtail!! Solid combo. We like it RAWWW! Salmon Belly Carpaccio: My favey fave of the raw dishes. Salmon belly is salmon's sophisticated and hot older cousin. Don't be stupid and not order this dish. Catch roll: Got two of these little flaming bad boys. Got to see a blowtorch light these puppies up like the fourth of July! That's showbiz babyyyyyy and we're in Vegas!!! Crunchy rice cakes: Every soosh place has crispy tuna rice cakes. This is not every soosh place. So good we ordered another plate and scarfed these down not like the fine women we are. Perfectly worded as \"tater tot tuna boats\". Grilled Spanish octopus: Personally my favorite dish!!!! Oh my word. Octopi are my favorite animal and even that didn't stop me from hogging the whole plate. Perfectly grilled with little touches of sweet potato and some other veggies thrown in there that I hoovered down with sophistication. Mushroom spaghetti: A huge favorite among the table. Garlicky. Creamy. There was carnage. No mercy no survivors on this dish. Charred broccolini (spicy!!!): CATCH made broccolini delicious. Usually broccolini and related companies are the redheaded stepchildren of the cruciferous vegetables (and vegetables in general). This is some voodoo that they were so bomb. Parm-truffle fries: Marinate me in that (VEGAN!!!!) truffle aioli and serve me hot and crispy. These fries were perfectly crispy and hot and sinful. I need to repent. AAAAAAND dessert (AKA the best part): \"Hit me\" chocolate Klondike cake: if you don't get this, you a big dumb dumb. Not only was this fun to completely destroy with fervor with a simple piece of cutlery, this was a big ol' square of milk chocolate delishus. Like so good. Hit me baby, one more time. And to really seal the deal, we had dark chocolate chip cookies that were a fan favorite across the table. Only sociopaths don't love a god damned chocolate chip cookie.  Danny Ye (sir chef himself) came over with the owners/ managers multiple times to make sure that they were killin' it (spoiler alert: they were). They were so kind, introductory, and generous with their service. Even better was Joe C (\"the tall one\"), our server. Our dinner would NOT have been the same without him. He was attentive and funny and kind and treated us like absolute #queens and was one of the best servers we've ever had and we all work in the service industry in town. Highly recommend requesting him if you want stellar service!!!!  They have tons of vegan options (cheesecake, pasta, etc) and a bitchin' cocktail menu. Although we had only wine (so goooooood, we had to snap pics of the bottles to save for later), can't wait to come back and try their cocktails like the matcha-tequila thingie. The menu is huge, like absolutely massive (like my waist after this dinner). The transformation into Carbie Barbie is complete. TILL NEXT TIME CATCH! Xoxo, the Carbie Barbies",

    "text": "Loved it, had so much fun there with friends. First entry way was beautiful with all the flowers! A dream :) We did wait about a half hour for table even though we had a reservation but no big deal, we enjoyed a drink at the bar and even better our waiter noticed and later brought us a round of shots! It was great!  Mimi oyster shooter with the Bloody Mary shot is genius, so yummy and of course fun to do. I'm not a huge truffle person but the truffle sashimi, so good! Flavor was amazing, we wanted to drink it, wished we could pour it over some rice ;) Mango Roll was good, catch roll even better.  Having it seared table side is a fun extra touch! Lobster Mac delish. We had the salmon and branzino, preferred the branzino. Tried both the HitMe dessert and donut wheel, HitMe for sure. The donut presentation is fun but just tastes okay. HitMe chocolate cake/dessert was very good and obviously fun to hit open.  Service was great! Miguel our server was so nice and helpful! A great time overall. I definitely will go back. So glad this beautiful place opened up.",

    "text": "Delicious food, but has growing pains.   I was recommended by a friend to try Catch - I'm glad I did! I love the Aria and Catch has an absolutely beautiful facade. However, it feels as though they need to improve their system and function/flow as a restaurant.  After arriving on time for 7:15 reservation, we see a man and his wife berate the hostess for having to wait 20 minutes past their reservation time to be seated. There are also about 4-5 groups just standing around waiting to be seated. This seems like a big problem for the restaurant-they don't anticipate people staying as long as they want, so they asked us to sit at a high table by the bar in exchange for two free appetizers. A deal, but obviously there are issues with the system. I wouldn't go with an urgency to make a show, because we wouldn't have made our show time if we had waited for a table instead of the bar.   As for the food and service throughout the meal, food was 5/5, service was again seemingly going through some problems. They had to comp a glass of wine because they forgot about it, and had two servers trying to take our order one after the other - lost in communication!   The food, though! Truffle sashimi was EXCELLENT and very flavorful, and the fried rock shrimp was on par if you've had the similar dish at Katsuya's. Creamy and a little spicy.  We also had the Wagyu tacos, those were okay. The meat didn't really shine the way wagyu should, so maybe try something else as the small taco wasn't really worth its price. The Charred Octopus was very well done and flavorful but not overpowering. At last the Cantonese 2.5lb Lobster arrives and that was incredible! A little on the spicy side, but tender and packed with flavor. Had charred broccolini on the side and it was a perfect green side dish. For dessert, the hot donut ferris wheel. Delicious, exactly what you want from donut balls: not dense, sugar melts on your tongue, and comes with four delicious sauces.   The food and menu have no problem here, but be prepared for the problems the restaurant experiences overall. Worth a try, definitely a 4-5 star if they can fix these problems and let their food shine!",

    "text": "It was my birthday and my boyfriend decided to pick where we eat and surprise me. Needless to say, when I saw what I was walking into & I thought it was going to be an amazing experience. Boy was I wrong. We arrived for our reservation at 7:30 about 10 minutes early. Strike one, our table wasn't ready. They proceeded to tell us that we needed to wait in the bar area. We waited until 7:55 and I sent my boyfriend to go ask how long we planned to wait because if I went it wouldn't have been a nice visit. Not only am I pregnant, but I came hungry expecting to be seated at 7:30. We finally were seated around 8:10. Strike 2, I saw he table looked at the hostess and my boyfriend and sat down, miserably. My table was not only about a foot and a half wide, but it was RIGHT next to the people next to us. The menu didn't even fit on it. I had to rest it on my belly. Let me add how uncomfortable it is to \"slide\" in and out of a table where you have about 6 inches of space between the next table, pregnant. Definitely not an area for someone who makes a reservation. I was upset when I saw someone who walked in just prior to us, receive a private booth that was available when we sat down. I didn't want to ruin the evening with the poor poor service that we had already received. So I made the best of the night. The food was good, not worth what we spent which was about $250. My boyfriend and I continuously filled our own water glasses with the bottle that was left there, while the waiter catered to the people next to us and their empty wine and water glasses. I will gladly say we will never be dining there again. You don't pay that much money for decent food and shit service. Save the money you'd spend here and head to Mizumi at the Wynn if you're wanting amazing service and amazing food that's comparable to this menu.",

Look if I was coming there for cocktails then fine, but it was our anniversary. Call me crazy but when I spend 400 dollars on dinner I don't want to be elbow to elbow with other patrons. They at first told us they had no other tables even though there were clearly other tables and it's not like we didn't make a reservation weeks in advance. They ended up seating us in the bar which was better but I think the hostess forgot to tell our waitress it was our 1 year anniversary and our waitress never asked. Kind of a big disappointment because we have been to numerous amazing restaurants on the strip and paid less for quality food and outstanding service. Here is was seriously lacking. The hostesses were pretty stupid and need some better training. All in all the food was okay but this place is seriously OVERRATED. Everyone just comes here for the instagrammable front. You want great food and service for 300 to 400 bucks, go to gorgon Ramsey steak! Way above this place in service and food quality. Sorry.",

Went there for my birthday with prior reservations and after we were seated we got up to take pictures in the lobby. The hostess came up to us and said we only have 3 more minutes to order food so she rudely demanded us to sit down and take pictures later. Then when we followed her directions and went to sit back down, we waited another 20 minutes for our waiter to come to our table to take our order. When we asked why we were told to sit down because we only have 3 minutes they said that is not True and hostess was incorrect, with no apology. Then to top it off they kept switching waiters on us. Then to top it off even more they brought us the wrong order at the end. When we let them know they told us the kitchen is closed and demanded we eat the incorrect order they brought us. We told them this is not what we ordered we asked for our waiter several times and its not our fault it took forever for our waiter and food to come out. Again, no apology and they were extremely unprofessional and demeaning to us. To a point where we felt uncomfortable, attacked and not safe. We told them we will not pay for a meal we did not eat and they demanded we pay and would not let us leave. They ruined my birthday and never cared. It was the worse experience ever with a horrible manager, ambience, food and service. I would never step my foot there again. They have no respect for human beings. Do not go!!!!",

    "text": "I was disappointed with my experience here. First impressions are largely important and I didn't receive a great one. I reserved a table last night for 9:30 and was not seated until 10:20. The hostess offered for us to have drinks at the bar while we waited however there was no room whatsoever so we waited outside instead. I can appreciate that it appeared to be a very busy night (considerably so for a Monday, although the restaurant is still very new and trendy) but I feel as though if one secures a reservation days ahead of time, the guaranteed time should be honored. I took my boyfriend here to celebrate his 25th birthday and we were both surprised and saddened by the substandard service. Our hostess forgot my name and came back to ask me what it was after we had been waiting about 30 minutes, and we weren't seated for another 20 minutes. She did not acknowledge the wait time or even apologize until 5 minutes prior to our seating. I work in an advanced professional capacity with VIP guests at another five diamond property on the strip (not Aria) and to assess this service as shocking and disappointing is an understatement. I noticed 4 open and set tables when we were finally being seated, so that was annoying to say the least. Our server Marcus S was a saving grace in a way. He was knowledgeable and attentive and the food was great, however the standing for almost an hour prior to our confirmed booking obviously left a bad taste in our mouths. Not a fun way to spend a birthday.",

Place is super fancy super hip and lots of either rich or pretending to be rich people. The service here is top notch,  what you would expect out of the place. My friend pretty much took care of the menu and ordered everything. There's so many dishes that I tried that I couldn't even remember what they were. Some of the ones that stood out in my mind were the truffle sashimi, this orange chicken shrimp thing and the steak. The truffle shashimi was soo good. I've tried other truffle sashimi dishes that were way overpowering but this one had the perfect balance of truffle and some kind of soy or citrus. Place is really good but I probably can't even afford to come back. It was a great spot for dinner when we were in Vegas.",

I had to actually scream across the table to have a conversation. You can hear people's conversations on the left and the right. It was so close to each other which I didn't like.  2. We ordered most of the popular items on the menu, but the only 2 items I liked was the truffle sashimi and the lobster mashed potatoes. Others were just ok to me. I was not impressed.  3. After our server took the order, he never showed up after to check up on us. Maybe a good 50 mins until he came and I was so disappointed that I didn't wanna try anything else and asked for the check.  Not sure if I would recommend this place but if your at Aria, come in and check out the entrance. That was the only thing that was cool about.",

    "text": "I'll get some things out of the way first.  Yes, I did have to wait to be seated even though I had made a reservation, though I didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes.  Yes, the tables there are very close together, especially the section with one long bench and regular seats on the other side.  I was aware of that when booking my reservation and requested something a little more spacious, preferably a private booth.  The restaurant wasn't able to honor my request exactly but did seat me and my dining companion at one of the ends of that section.  (The booths seemed to be held for larger parties.)  At least we only had neighbors on one side and they didn't arrive until about halfway through our dinner.  And yes, it is loud in there and I did find myself yelling out \"What?\" on several occasions.  Having said all that, I do think CATCH is a nice place to celebrate a special occasion: the entryway is an excellent picture-taking opportunity, service was prompt and professional, and the food was good.  We had the crispy shrimp, Catch roll, and mahi mahi wonton tacos which were tasty.  To drink I had the Watermelon Felon and for dessert we had the donut wheel, both also very good.  Heads up though - the donut wheel comes with 11 large donut holes and a few dipping sauces, and was too much for me and my dining companion, even taking them with us as leftovers.  One thing that would have been nice is if they had noted the birthday on our reservation - they didn't offer a greeting at any point of our meal so I had to ask for \"happy birthday\" writing to be put on our dessert.  Still, I can give CATCH 4 stars based on my experience.",

This place is amazing from the gorgeous fairytale, floral entrance that surprises your senses with so many colors and picture op (had to add that in lol)...if you werent excited you will be now.   Reservations are a must!! They do allow walk ins but expect to wait awhile. It's a fairly large restaurant but they are jam packed so book that spot now!!   Decor: all I gotta say is I haven't seen a place with so much to see. Absolutely beautiful!  We were greeted by the hostess and sat within 5 min of checking in, yes we had a reservation. We were seated and within minutes our server, Ed greeted us with extreme friendliness. He explained a few things on the menu, gave us a few recommendations and took our drink order.   We took Ed up on some of his recommendations and we were not disappointed.  We love the whole sharing factor, you can try so many different things!!   Dishes: *Truffle sashimi - YES you MUST TRY!!! *Crispy Shrimp- more of a traditional, simple dish. Didnt shock me but if you like cooked shrimp this is a good option *Catch Ceviche- wow the mango and orange with the ponzu sauce, no words *Trio Tartar- so many flavors all at once *Scallop Gnocchi - not my favorite, but my girls loved it * Spanish Grilled Octopus - YES another MUST try!!! *Mango Shrimp Roll- they serve it with a spicy type sauce, YUMMM we kept the sauce to use with other dishes LoL. Yes that good! *Sticky coconut cake- loved this, the sorbet looks like a coconut shell and with the mango sauce it mixed so well with one another *Hit Me Chocolate Cake- Really cool delivery, not a huge chocolate fan but I do gotta say this cake wasnt as sweet as it looked so I ate alot LOL.   Presentation of each dish was 5 stars!!! When served each dish was explained very well.   Service overall definitely 5 stars!!! Ed was attentive and our food came in a very timely manner. He checked on us just enough for us to be extremely happy and super satisfied with our first time to CATCH. We will be back for sure!!!!",

    "text": "I really want to like this place, I really do because they have vegan menu and they have a great selection of seafood plus it's my anniversary dinner that my husband secretly planned.    But this place is LOUD and NOISY and I am not loving the service.   The waiter interrupted us few times; also the bus boys.  I guess they focus how fast the tables can turn around way more than customers service  The alcohol is really expensive here too.  I can buy the entire mini bottle of the sake for the price they charge here in a shot.  The wines as well.  They charge $40 a glass for a bottle that average cost around $35. We really should have brought our own wine, again I emphasized to my husband. Lol  FYI.  I live in Vegas so I am not a tourist and usually not used to tourist / casino pricing either.   Tonight it's a special night and we do like to splurge ourselves few times a month.   One thing that blew my mind is how uncomfortable the seating is.  My legs are cramped.    Okay.  Let's get to the food.  The food is actually good. LOL.  I know!!! The only savior of the night.  Some dishes are super salty though like the beet salad.  I did like my sashimi trio and cut rolls.  My husband also likes his bronzino.    But since we have been feeling so rushed this entire night.  We are leaving!!!  Ordering was rushed, appetizer was rushed, sipping wine was rushed.  For a $300 dinner that we have to be rushed and finish in 45 mins.  YES, that's why I am giving only 3 stars.  Not because the food but because of everything else especially the service.",

    "text": "My friend and I visit LA and Las Vegas several times a year. I have always wanted to try Catch in LA but decided against it based on their Yelp reviews and attitude that \"celebrity\" status comes before everyone and everything else.   After discussing Catch with some of the Aria Luxury Experience staff and a few managers of Aria restaurants where we are \"regular\" visitors, we decided to give Catch in the Aria a try.   The restaurant is beautiful. The food is excellent and our service was top notch. Maybe this is because we are pretty often visitors to the Aria but regardless I found the staff friendly, knowledgeable and on top of their game. Each dish we tried was done to perfection and is exactly what you'd expect from a high end sushi type restaurant. The highlight was the Catch roll and torched crab leg (we had to order another one after the first...it was that good).   The \"hit me\" chocolate cake was delicious but definitely big enough for two to share.   I will probably still pass on Catch LA but will go back to Catch Vegas.",

    "text": "I finally got to try Catch!!! I must confess I insisted on coming here so that I could have the \"Hit Me\" cake.  The Place: The restaurant is beautiful! It has a modern and trendy atmosphere. I made reservations for my husband and me at 9 pm. I was disappointed when the host took us to our table.  It was super small and felt cramped. There was a group of 4 people to our right and a couple to our left. The table was so small that we could not put the menus on it. I had a claustrophobic attack and kindly requested our waiter for other seats. He graciously agreed and took us to a better table.    The Food: As the name suggests, Catch specialty is Seafood, but the menu has steaks too. For seafood, they have Cold, Raw Bar, Sushi, tapas, and main dishes. The price of the food is on the expensive side.   *We got the \"Catch Ceviche,\" it was amazing! Maine lobster, scallops, shrimp, crab, mango, and a blood orange sauce that made it so distinctive.    We had the \"Crispy Whole Snapper\" to share with truffle fries. The fish was delicious. I have had fried fish before, but this is one of the best I have had. The crust was delicious, and the fish inside was so juicy! I loved it! They bring the dish so you can take photos and they take it to get the bones out.   The dessert menu was interesting too! But I was on a mission, so we chose the \"HIT ME.\" A delicious chocolate cake with dulce de leche, liquid klondike inside a chocolate cake. I was the happiest person in the world when I hit it. I thought it was a pretty cake, but when I tasted it I was blown away!    We had the food with a margarita and \"MO'jito MO'problems.\" I think the mojito was OK, nothing really to say about it.  The Service: The staff was friendly and professional. I liked the way the first waiter handled my request for a bigger table. Our second waiter was pleasant. He was not very talkative, but he gave us a couple of suggestions.   I do want to come back! I wish I could afford it!",

    "text": "This NY upscale Asian style seafood & sushi lounge is similar to Tao in which it has a hip and club vibe as the place is hopping and at 10pm a live DJ starts spinning classic hip hop (at least on the Monday night). The menu has variety of small bites, small plates, sushi & larger entrees all meant for sharing. Started off with their skewers of:  Chicken Meatballs - a breadcrumb type crust over a juicy meatball accompanied with a hoisin dipping sauce.  Eggplant - Light grilled and very well prepared with a miso dressing.  Beef- tender but needed some finishing salt.  Other dishes shared were grilled octopus over a saute potato goodness that was probably the star of the dish; truffle fries that had plenty of truffle flavor and was McDonald styled tasty. The lobster mash potatoes was ok, so use your calories on something else.  The main dish was a whole snapper from head to tail and was lightly battered served over vegetables and accompanied with a similar hoisin sauce. The meat was tender at some parts and they will filet for you if desired.  For dessert the donut wheel of cake style donut holes covered with sugar and served with caramel, raspberry & chocolate sauces rounded out the meal.",

    "text": "Since the opening of Catch, it has been on our list of restaurants to check out. We made a reservation on Open Table for a 730pm reservation, w/ a note that it was our anniversary. We happened to arrive about an hour early in hopes we could get in early. Nope. They gave us the option to sit on a high top table in front, but wouldn't place us on a list of possible tables to be sat early. I asked if we would receive a text or given a device to notify us if when our table was ready. Another no. We were instructed to return closer to our reservation time. Odd that in a technology based world, an establishment that takes pride in their atmosphere from the moment you arrive, doesn't have a service that you other establishments are using to contact their guests who are off property.   Arriving at Catch is amazing. Their hallway makes you feel like you're being transported to another world. The Instagram worth Catch bench along w/ a butterfly photo opt are inserted in this same walk way. Coming or going it's so fun to walk thru. We walked out to grab a drink elsewhere since it was LOUD in the front of the house of Catch. Upon returning, Catch's security stopped me w/ a glass of whiskey. No outside drinks. I haven't been to a casino restaurant where not only do they have security, BUT I can't take a drink in from another place. I threw back my whiskey and walked into Catch to check back in. Arrived back at 725pm. We were sat at 750pm. This is where that device or text service comes in handy. We could've stayed at another bar or establishment until our table was ready.  As we walked through the dining area it just got louder. Then we were taken to another room which was much quieter. The room was curtained off due to lack of reservations I'm guessing. We were greeted within minutes by our server, who immediately wished us happy anniversary. That was key as we've been to several places booked through Open Table w/ notes, to which the establishment/server doesn't read. Our server got right into the specials and recommendations.   We ordered our drinks and made friends w/ the table next to us. We asked what they ordered, which happen to be a couple items our server recommended.   Truffle Sashimi - Tuna, Hamachi, Chili Oil, Ponzu, Caviar, Black Truffle - This just melts in your mouth, break out the drooling emoji!  Catch Roll - Crab, Salmon, Miso Honey - Again another great selection, SO tasty  Lobster roll - Maine Lobster Salad, Potato Roll, Chive - These are smaller than what you may think of an actual lobster roll. The bun isn't warm. Still good, but from experience a warm bun is DEF better.   BLUEFIN TORO SCALLION - wasn't feeling this one due to the flavor  SPICY JAPANESE YELLOWTAIL - Good, same quality I've found at other sushi places in Vegas off the strip  The food was good. I honestly expected it to be better, like all of it. W/ the presentation at the front of the house, the delay on being sat and being on the strip it added up to it should be better tasting than what it was. Our neighbors who ended up being locals said the same thing. The first two items we ordered we were we expected the flavors and tastes to be. From there, everything declined.   Catch is a cool experience. If you're going for the experience for Instagram, you can take your photos w/o having to eat the food. The food itself, there's comparable and better sushi found on and off the strip for less of the cost. I will say our server though was always attentive.",

    "text": "Catch is one of those Strip restaurants that has the glitz and glam and full bankroll support of the casino, without the food to match. This isn't to say that the food is terrible, but rather it's not anything special that you can't find at any sushi restaurant. But, if you pick and choose, there are some golden nuggets within the menu without having to go overboard on the price.  We started off dinner with the truffle sashimi from the signature cold plates, skipping the rest of the raw bar and cold options. Despite the $31 price point, we all enjoyed the chili oil, ponzu, caviar and black truffle atop delicious pieces of tuna and hamachi. We tried a few more of the hot plates to start off the meal including the crunchy rice cakes ($26 for 4), grilled Spanish octopus ($24) and the scallop gnocchi ($29). The crunchy rice cakes are something you might find commonly at any sushi or AYCE sushi restaurant. This was no different with tuna tartare and wasabi tobiko atop a fried rice cube. I still get it and enjoy it every time. The scallop gnocchi with bay scallops, soft fluffy gnocchi topped with parmesan and black truffle was my fiancee's favorite. I thought the octopus was well cooked and tender.   For entrees, we skipped the big fish and meat and instead got the yakiami style whole dorade ($44) and the organic crispy chicken ($34). The dorade was boneless and surprisingly well-flavored. I especially enjoyed the soy mirin truffle emulsion. It was slightly on the salty side and needed something to cut it, like rice, but still very good. The chicken tasted like a really good shake and bake chicken breast. Still, it was very tender and juicy - which is all I can ask for in restaurant-cooked chicken. We also tried the crispy Brussels sprouts as a side, which had an interesting yuzu-calamansi vinaigrette with dry miso - again slightly on the salty side.  We ended dessert with the eye-catching \"hit me\" chocolate cake ($19) and the sticky coconut cake ($16). I'm a sucker for coconut, so that one was my favorite. The chocolate cake featured a liquid \"Klondike\" block which you were supposed to break unleashing a flow of chocolate onto the layers of dulce de leche ice cream brownie & Devil's food. Rich and decadent is an understatement.  The name, Catch, itself is somewhat deceiving in that, I fully expected a seafood heavy menu, when in fact, it featured more Asian fusion flavors. The dining experience is centered around the ambiance including the entrance and dining room, which are quite elegant - so much so, that we witnessed a couple get engaged in that tunnel of flowers afterwards. If you can stomach the price, it's a fun experience. Just know that many items can also be found at AYCE sushi restaurants. Basically skip the rolls and nigiri and cold plates and order ones that have truffle in the description.",

    "text": "I made an opentable reservation for 6:45pm. Showed up at 7pm exactly. Waited for them to help the people in front of us and when I got to the front, the Asian hostess with the heavily mascaraed lashes (who claimed to be the assistant manager?) said that 15 minutes was the grace period for reservations and it was 7:02pm so our table was gone. I was shocked. Making a reservation is supposed to be for the convenience of the guest. She offered to seat us at a high top table in the bar area. I was not interested in sitting at a two seater in the bar area sandwiched between two other parties so we went back and nicely demanded another seat. They sat us in the main area at a table that was half a couch and half a chair. Kind of annoying but better than sitting at the loud bar area. The place was busy but there were definitely many other tables available. This really gave our dinner a bad start.   It should have been nice. The decor in there was amazing. There is a super instagrammable entrance. You walk through and it feels like magic. Til you reach the host stand and have to deal with BS. Once seated, our server was nice. We ordered the seafood tower, which was delicious and filling and then got a lobster roll, the lobster mac and cheese and the crispy brussel sprouts. Finished the meal off with the \"hit me\" dessert which was like a liquid klondike bar over a chocolate dessert. I was happy with the food although with pricing like this, the people working there should be more welcoming and accommodating. I am docking two stars because that was not a good way to start off a nice, expensive meal and there are definitely many other great options in Vegas for you to spend your hard earned money at.",

    "text": "Style over substance isn't necessarily a bad thing and Catch is a great example.  If I wanted sushi and seafood at this price point, Zuma at Cosmopolitan would be the better choice, but you can't tell me this place isn't a good time!  The \"if Gabi Coffee and Bakery had millions of dollars to spend\" atmosphere, decor and vibe are big reasons why this is a spot I'd gladly return to; preferably with a group so I could sit in one of those cool birdcage booths.  We started with \"Toro Tartare\"....and sent it back after two bites because the sauce it was wading in was a complete turn-off.  When enjoying high quality ingredients like fatty tuna and caviar, less is more and even the half wedge of lime on the side suggesting it be squeezed over everything is like inviting a cat to piss on a Persian carpet.  It was great after they brought it back sans sauce and I suggest you get it that way.  \"Yakiami Style Whole Dorade\" with cippolini onion, heirloom tomato, capers and soy mirin truffle emulsion was my favorite dish of the night and would have been even better with rice.  Perhaps due to an overwhelming amount of booze by this point in the evening, I prefaced my request to the server as \"This may be the most Asian thing I've said today, but can I get a bowl of white rice?\"  They unfortunately were unable to accommodate since only sushi rice was available.  I got over it quickly though because the \"Sauteed Wild-Caught Snapper\" was delicious as well with the filet sitting on top of a tasty lobster mash with truffle and lemon brown butter.  The tableside blowtorch to the \"Catch Roll\" was fun and memorable, even if the taste of the crab, salmon and miso honey combination somehow wasn't.  The $52 whole lobster cocktail was kind of like not going all the way; although really nice with the curry dip, it wasn't worth the price and I'd just go with a full seafood tower instead, which includes it.   \"Sticky Coconut Cake\" with coconut water sorbet and mango sauce was a nice combination of sweet and tart to end it all.    3.751111119 stars",

Now because I love seafood, this place has always been on my radar and with all of the great marketing they do around Las Vegas, it was hard for me not to bookmark this place! Little did I know, I would be provided an opportunity to eat here a lot faster than I realized. AWESOME!   Reservations are strictly followed here, meaning that your entire party needs to be present in order to be seated so yeah my friend that was late made us all wait but the food made up for it, that's for SURE! Once we were seated, I noticed the ambiance was even more dreamy inside! The iconic walkway with all the flowers and that whole garden feel is super cool. Now, please note that the music here is REALLY loud so be prepared to yell at whoever you are sitting with and that includes giving your order to your server! We all started with a round of drinks which were awesome! Drinks ordered: Meatpacking Manhattan(super strong and I loved it), East Coast Cocktail and Sauv Blancs.  Our server Joseph was amazing as he made some very good recommendations to the table! Each and every item that we ordered was nothing short from amazing! Talk about a knock your socks off type of dining experience. I like the whole sharing concept and putting the dishes on the spinning wheel deal. I felt like we ordered a feast of a meal but with 4 people, everything ended up being just enough food without having to worry about left overs. Pricey but it's extremely worth it! A Must try if you're in Vegas kind of place!",

    "text": "WOW!!!  If you are looking for an incredible, high-end meal with impeccable service then this is your place.   We came as a party of four, including two weird allergies. The waiter was super receptive, and said he would make sure everything was prepared properly or inform us if we should order something else. So professional. He explained anything and everything on the menu by memory, made suggestions, and was just more like a guide through a fun evening than a server. Kudos to him.  But more importantly, the food was so delicious. We got excited and ordered a lot! The cocktails were strong, unique, and balanced. Well done. We ordered the Tempura King Crab and Grilled Ocotopus appetizers. Oh my god. The tempura batter was so light, and the crab was perfectly tender. Dipped in the accompanying ponzu type sauce was absolutely delicious. A unique take on the usual tempura. The octopus was cooked just right- tender and not chewy. The whole dish was beautiful.  For entrees we had the seared ahi tuna, scallops & cauliflower, and filet mignon. All of them were perfect. The tuna steak was prepared just as requested, and was presented beautifully. The scallops was so soft, and a little crispy right on the top. The cauliflower and sauce made for little delights in every bite. And the filet! Served as two small medallions, they were as tender as any steakhouse we've visited. It had some kind of wine sauce that really added to the depth. For sides, we had the Brussels and sweet potatoes. Both also incredible! The sweet potatoes were a little spicy and sweet- a flavor profile I hadn't experience with that veggie.  Overall, such a wonderful evening. Highly recommend for a nice night out, date, or special occasion. Oh, and the place is beautiful as well. Bonus!",

    "text": "\"Selfie time!  Can you guys move?  I only want myself in it\" says Midwest poker bud as he preens himself for his phone.  \"Prima donna.  Actually more like Madonna\" I mutter in response.  Catch, an impressive re-invention of LA and NYC hot spot eateries scaled way up for the Vegas world of excess.  Reclaimed wood comingled with contemporary flair make for an impressive dining space.  High vaulted ceilings and brightly lit display of liquor, a stunning, welcoming bar.  Retro contemporary elegance, a plush lounge.  Nooks abound for shameless social media self promotion.  Oh and the food is great!  Asian influenced, fresh and seasonal.  For example, the truffle sashimi starter.  Maguro and hamachi are sliced thin and folded over.  They are drizzled with and sit in a pool of broken chili oil and ponzu vinaigrette.  Black truffle puree and caviar sit atop.  Earthy, oceanic, spicy, acidic flavors all play off the clean, slightly sweet fish flavors.  Excellent.  The A5 Miyazaki wagyu, as good as any.  Thin sliced, sprinkled with sea salt and sesame seeds.  Grill it on one side on the hot stone allowing the salt to melt into the fat, reroll and dip into the yuzu / soy / garlic oil sauce.  Good eats.  The tender grilled Spanish octopus with sofritto and garlic aioli over a bed of crispy potatoes and perfectly cooked scallop gnocchi with black truffle and parm both mouthwatering good.  Finally, the whole branzino.  Oven roasted, head on, whole fish, spine removed and butterflied open before being stuffed with a stir-fry of pattypan squash, whole baby zucchini, artichokes, tomato and wilted arugula all dressed in a tangy citrus vinaigrette.  Perfectly cooked, the flavors work well together.  Very good.  The only weak point, sushi.  Not the best rice, over seasoned and sticky.  Not the highest quality, freshest, sashimi grade seafood.  (uni, tako and saba sampled).  Pedestrian.  The \"Catch roll\", reverse roll of crab, rice on the outside topped with fatty salmon and finished with a miso honey is good but the rolling looks like an armature did it.  Unappetizing.  Service is clumsy and lacks confidence.  It will improve with time.  Solid mixology program.  Good wine list.  High Vegas resort markup.  Worthy of its home in Aria.",

The 'chef' is inflexible with slight modifications to food... i.e. no advocado, rainbow on top, etc.  For up to $200+ a person, out a piece of salmon on the roll of the salmon if that is what the customer wants.  If it's a new waiter, instead of having crappy service, offer him help when he needs it, don't wait for the customer to ask for the manager to help him get food an hour after he ordered it.  To the management: no one walks into Catch expects a free meal, or to have a cheap meal.  When everything goes wrong, instead of discounting the meal try committing to excellence the next time a customer comes back and then you won't be reading reviews like this.    We don't need free food, we want calm, competence and good food!  All the time!!  I ate there three times last week and had 3 different experiences, all too loud!",

We go to Las Vegas for the food and the standards in this city are very high. The server proudly told us the focus of the menu was truffles... I wish he would have told us that that just meant everything gets doused in cheap truffle oil.   We spent much of the evening laughing about what a big mistake we made. This is the last time I will go to a restaurant opening in Vegas... I will stick to places that have enough real reviews to judge their quality. All the positive reviews for this place are by people who live in Vegas and are from before the restaurant opened.",

The second time I went to Catch, however, was a completely different story. While the food was still amazing, the service definitely left a bad taste in my mouth that would make me think twice about ever dining at this restaurant again.   My second time at Catch, I went with two others who had never been before. We had a reservation, we arrived on time, and it still took them 30 minutes to seat us. We saw about five parties, both large and small, who checked in after us get seated long before we did. The hostess seemed unconcerned and unapologetic about our frustrations and did not exhibit any customer service basics by any means. The extremely poor service we received from the hostess ruined the rest of the experience at Catch for the others in my party for the rest of the night.   As far as food goes, over my two visits, I've tried the below and all were AMAZING: - Truffle Sashimi (a must!) - Catch Ceviche - Hellfire Roll - King Crab Tempura - Wagyu Short Rib Tacos - New York Strip - Lobster Mashed Potatoes - Hit Me Chocolate Cake - Sticky Coconut Cake (my fave of the two desserts I tried)  The food is definitely 5 stars. 2.5 stars overall because of the bad service.",

The bartenders were great (Jacob, I believe), the dim lighting made it intimate but the music kept the energy flowing.

It pieced together beautifully and high recommend trying it when you dine here.",

I stuck with something easy and got a dozen mid sized East Coast Oysters to start and they were super fresh and absolutely delicious. Then I tried the Spicy Shrimp appetizer which wasn't that great, however the Filet Skewers were made to perfection, so I had to order another plate of them. To be honest after 12 Oysters and 4 Skewers and 4 Cocktails, I was stuffed! But I saw another table that had some delicious Chocolate Chip Cookies and I had to order the same, and they came out freshly baked, warm and gooey! I was in heaven and ready to go to bed to be honest! Damn you CATCH! I'm in Vegas, now I need a 4 Hour energy!   The staff was amazing, the ambiance was superb, and I can't wait to return!",

My co worker and shared a few bites; I personally do not eat fish but she LOVED the catch roll. The beet salad was delightful light and crisp. We ordered sweet potato cashew fries so so good no extra sauce needed. I got the steak skewers it was one of the most buttery soft beef I have ever had. They sever a salty soy sauce it's great with and without. The cauliflower was crispy and full of flavor. We had some cocktails as well I had a pineapple train wreck highly recommend ! Not too sweet very well balanced. I tried going to wine tried the Malbec by the glass it was gross don't get it; tasted corked but the table next to us ordered a bottle and said the same. I also got lush lemon aid had to be my favorite drink but it can get you in trouble. (Can't taste the liquor) the sever was sweet to bring me a lemon drop shot for my birthday and we ordered this slice of heaven chocolate cake with a sauce that was inside a hard chocolate shell and ice cream. The reason for the four stars was because we had reservations and people that arrived after us were sat before us. We waited 45 mins after our checking in on time. Other than that server was great, food bomb !, and the oasis feel from the beautiful garden throughout the venue. I recommend everyone try this place if you enjoy small delicious bits it's worth the wait.",

When we arrived, which BTW was the first sign that it was going to be bad, there were a dozen hostesses and only one could help you! Really? They mentioned they saw that it was our anniversary yet they never did or said anything to reference our anniversary. The bill was $400 for us and our teenage kids. Not unheard of for fine dining, however, this was FAR from fine dining. The Crispy shrimp and the truffle sashimi were the only good items.  Note: 0 STARS is not an option.  P.S. If anyone knows Gordon Ramsey can you tell him to check this place out?",

We were sat after about 20 min.  The atmosphere is fun and exciting. It's loud with conversation, just the way I like it. The only complaint is that the tables are SO CLOSE to each other, you are basically elbow to elbow with the table next to you. I recommend this restaurant for groups, but it is NOT a romantic vibe. You cannot be having romantic conversations unless you want everyone around you to contribute LOL.  All the food we ordered was delicious.  The beet salad, was sweet and tender, the perfect start to our meal.  We also ordered oysters, which were fresh and amazing.  For entrees, we ordered the whole roasted Branzino and the 1.5lb King Crab legs. I was in freakin' heaven.  The only thing I'd do differently next time is course out the crab legs first, and then once those are done, ask for the Branzino because cracking crab legs takes too long and I couldn't properly pay attention to the Branzino.  Also, they had crackers, but no small forks. Either a bib is needed or they should cut tiny slits in the crab legs so it's not so much work to crack them open.  Regardless, it was a lovely $300 meal and I can't wait to go back.",

We arrived 15 minutes early and they asked us to sit at the bar to wait for our table. One of your hostess is miserable, she hates her job and can't even fake a smile to welcome people. Isn't that part of her job? I have to add, our reservation was at 6:30, the night was just starting, the restaurant wasn't packed. It's too early to be in a bad mood.   We were finally seated after our reservation, which they blamed on their system not allowing them to give us a different table. Not a big deal, until we saw how small our table was, and how close it was to the table next to ours. No joke, there must be 8 inches between tables. As our neighbors arrived, the girl squeezed in to sit down, dragggggging her butt on top of our table. Our server was apologetic, but that didn't fix anything.   I wish we had spent $200 somewhere else. Save your money and go to Cleo or another restaurant at Aria. When you go out for dinner, you don't pay $200 to sit 8 inches from another table. You've left a bad taste in your customers mouth, that will likely never give you business again. The fake flower wall isn't worth a $200 dining \"experience\" when you can't have a private conversation at your table with a date.",

Food is really over priced, I mean I am willing to spend $$$$ on fine dining, but I feel most of the time I do the food delivers, make me feel like it's worth it. This was so mediocre, it wasn't special enough for me to return for the food. I actually wasn't a fan of their entrees, the appetizers were way better, it was spectacular actually, but then again if you are willing to pay $21 + tax for a cauliflower lol. The sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts, broccoli are really my favorites. Cocktails are great as well. I think it's a great place if you want somewhere trendy, early 40's crowd, this is a place to grab some tapas, appetizer, and drinks and socialize.",

I was so excited so I made reservations early in advance. So why the 1/5 stars? The service was absolutely awful! It started with the rude, untrained and entitled hostesses who acted like they were too good for their job... RME. We had a 7 pm reservation, but they did not seat us until 7:40. The crazy thing is our table was available at 7 bc I checked inside to look for empty tables when they said we had to wait, and 7:40 comes along and they seat us at the table that had been empty since before 7. After waiting for 40 mins, you would think they'd apologize. Then our server... nice but improvement is much needed. He placed the dessert menu down then pushed it towards us, all without saying a word hahah. So weird and funny that I couldn't be mad.  As for the food, all overly salty. The only good thing was the truffle sashimi. *Advice to management, please train your employees on proper customer service bc you cant charge 5* prices and only provide 1* service.  *side note- the security at the entrance A+++, PLEASE promote him to become the new host. He greeted us upon entrance and said thank you and enjoy your night as we exited. As for the hostess, I guess they can't speak",

Paying $20 for dessert meant that my mind was about to get blown with innovative flavors and techniques. In reality, it meant that I was getting their version of a Klondike bar with chocolate cake. It was abysmal and the flavor profile severely lacked!",

I'm not gonna lie, this place is so busy which might explain the bad reviews about service. We didn't receive bad service, we just had our server forget to put in an item which was ok because at the end we were so full. The server was really nice and recommended some items that we absolutely loved. My boyfriend loved the potatoes and he usually doesn't like them. All the food was beyond perfect!",

Incompetent managers who don't know the first thing about hospitality.   FOOD: pedestrian sushi menu, poor quality, and even worse execution. Brussels sprouts were flavorless and uninspired. Desserts are gimmicky and do not taste good. Tables right on top of each other...literally had 6 inches of space between the table next to us.

We shared salmon carpaccio, spicy tuna roll, sea urchin sushi and Brussels sprouts.   The food was good though very pricy.  Being in Vegas I understand the high prices on fresh seafood or everything else but to pay $16 for Brussels sprouts was a little ridiculous.   We are used to paying the exactly same thing for $5 during happy hour in San Diego.    Anyway, we enjoy the food and the service was great.",

My only issue with it was the music being a bit too loud, but otherwise, almost impeccable ambience.   We ordered the following:  truffle sashimi: this was to die for. The fish was very fresh and the truffle oil and caviar topping were very decadent and paired perfectly with the fish. I would order again   Snapper nigiri/yellowtail nigiri: very tender fish and very fresh. Would also order again   Wagyu Gyoza: I had never had wagyu in a gyoza and this was amazing. The beef is very tender and juicy while in the gyoza and I would also order this again.   Branzino plate: perhaps the best Branzino dishnive had. The fish is grilled to perfection and has a nice crisp to it.   Staff is very friendly and I would totally recommend for special occasions.",

Our cocktail waitress was extremely sweet. We had the lobster roll, cauliflower, and salmon carpaccio. Then the amazing food runner Alfredo sent over a truffled sashimi plate for us that had a dab of caviar. That was honestly the best dish I've possibly ever had in a restaurant. Since then I've brought in chefs to specifically try this item and every single one of them couldn't get over the unique and amazing flavors.  I absolutely love this venue and will continue to come back.",

CATCH is located in Aria near the main lobby. We tried to make a reservation for 4 people two days before and they were \"booked.\" Although, they do have a bar which is first come, first serve that does not require reservations. Luckily, we were able to find a spot on the bar where we ordered drinks and food. It worked out for us but seems as though they are unorganized.   The server was never around for us to order more food so we ended up closing our ticket and leaving which took 15min to even find the server to close out our ticket.   The food and drinks were definitely worth the inconvenience but some dishes were unnecessarily overpriced and not worth a penny.",

The menu is a True focus in providing a culinary experience.  How do you even choose.  We opted for the seafood towers to get a variety (around $195) and we were not disappointed.  Some of the best sushi we have had.  The staff was attentive and the sommelier had wonderful wine pairing selections and recommendations.   Catch is worth your own time and dining investment.

And then it was my wife's birthday and as a complimentary birthday item they bring her two chocolate chip cookies? Really???? After $225 meal that's what we get? I will stick to Nobu at the hard Rock. You get dishes with flavor, not bland blugh, awesome customer service, like you have 3 waiters on you st all time and you feel special there.

We walked in at 7.15pm on a Saturday and it was busy but we got a spot on the bar corner ASAP. We ordered a drink. I had the watermelon cocktail which was delicious, exotically presented. Next to us there was a large bachelor party. They treated us to a glass of champagne for our cuteness, that was funny and unexpected. I just like to touch my boyfriend his bald head and that seems to be cute hahahaha.  We ordered the warm crab hand roll - an obvious as its the first thing we ate together at our first date in Miami 4 years ago:) it was delicious. The menu doesn't mention its a little spicy but it does give an afterkick. We ordered the  lobster avocado roll another hit. It comes with a spicy mango sauce but we both agreed we liked it better without it and just plain to take in all flavors. Our next order was the spicy tuna roll, I don't like spicy so I tried one piece which was mouth melting, but I couldn't handle the spicyness of it. We had a great time at Catch, very nice date spot but also good for any other occasion. If i would come back I'd hope to sit in the darker room on the right hand side when you walk in, I really liked the atmosphere there.",

They aren't just a place with \"vegan options\" they're a place that the chef clearly enjoys making vegan or plant based options. I appreciate that the option for \"vegan\" was plant based. It was healthy, filling and delicious. I should have stopped FAR sooner than I did on the \"cheesecake\" but it was killer. I was just disappointed in the service. It was inconsistent. For a 5 star dining experience I feel like we shouldn't have had empty glasses or been waiting for anything but we did. I realize it was busy but then price yourself as a 4 star restaurant would, or higher more experienced staff. I would absolutely come back to Catch if I ever come back to Vegas but they need to work on the service a bit.",

From the moment you walk in the vibe with the upbeat top 40 music and decor is meant for a good Vegas night ahead and perfect for that insta pic.  I've been here on two different occasions and tried different things each time, the plates are definitely made to share.   For appetizers, I highly recommend the truffle sashimi it is the best thing on their menu...it is very rich and tasty (I love truffle). The crispy cauliflower with spicy mayo is another great appetizer with lots of flavor and more filling than the truffle sashimi (very similar to Nobus rock shrimp tempura). For sides, get the truffle fries they taste good on its own or paired with the New York steak, I liked that the fries have a lot of truffle taste not just a hint of it.   For entrees, the New York steak is great & the oysters tasted fresh and yummy even though I'm not a fan of oysters too much.   CONS: I also tried the grilled mahi mahi which tasted a bit too over cooked.  The catch roll has a great presentation but tasted too crabby for me which I didn't like.",

We sat in the dining room and we were immediately by our server (I can't remember her name but she was awesome!)   I started with the East Coast Kali cocktail which was amazing and my friend had the One Too Many. She also enjoyed the Pineapple Trainwreck. I tasted both and I'm convinced all of their cocktails are amazing.   For food we had sashimi which my friend thoroughly enjoyed. Next was lobster Mac and cheese, tempura crab, truffle fries. The lobster mac was very different than what you may be used too, lots of flavor. The tempura crab was my favorite. It was cooked just right. We would probably get two orders of that next time! The truffle fries were perfect. The right amount of truffle oil, Parmesan and herbs.   This was topped off by the Hit Me chocolate cake. That was also great! To state the obvious, this was a great experience. Music played the entire time at the perfect volume. We did not feel like we had to yell to hear each other. Catch is beautiful and lively.   Special shout out to Chris F. For ensuring we had a great experience. We'll be back soon.",

From the entrance hallway all the way to the good lighting in the bathroom (lol yes, I'm serious) this is a place where you want to dress up and look your best.  Music wasn't too loud in my opinion. I could hear the song but I was still able to carry on a conversation. This seems like the new direction Vegas restaurants may be heading. \"Nightlife restaurant dining experience\" is what I would describe this. Their playlist had a lot of throwback r&b, a bit of hip hop, some pop. Think 2000s music genre. I personally enjoyed it. Please don't change the music format. It was great hearing 112's \"Hey Luv.\" Haven't heard that in awhile...thanks for putting that back on my playlist =)  BF and I were here mid-February and we received solid service throughout our dinner. We were checked on multiple times...drinks were constantly replenished....the correct food items were delivered. Each waiter who brought out our food introduced the name of the dish, the ingredients and if applicable, the sauces used.   Most items are served more like tapa style. We ordered the following: -Truffle Sashimi....delicious! One of our favs of the night. -Filet Skewers...cooked to order. Delicious flavoring! I ordered this as my entree since I was too full from all the other appetizers. Comes with 3 skewers I think. -Hellfire Roll: spicy tuna two ways, pear, balsamic. Very interesting combo and we enjoyed it a lot!  -Spicy Tuna Roll -Crispy Shrimp....a little heavy on the spicy mayo so this can fill you up quick. -Mushroom Spaghetti. Sauce was good..wasn't too heavy on the mushroom taste. -and a side of crispy brussel sprouts.  For dessert...I already had my heart set on the vegan Pistachio cheesecake and man...that did NOT disappoint. It was heavenly!!!!!!!!!!!   All in all, it was a very beautiful night. Eye-pleasing decor, service was on point ANDDDDD the food was delicious. Reservations recommended.",

Sadly, the food did not live up to the hype, and everything seemed to be overpriced. Granted, I'm willing to pay good money for a good meal, but CATCH dropped the ball.   The highlight of the meal was dessert! The s'mores pizza with a crisp crust was oooh so good. I wish I could have had a pint of their burnt marshmallow ice cream to go. My friends and I were able to let out our frustrations from the lackluster meal with the \"Hit Me\" Chocolate Cake. The star of the show was the Donut Wonder Wheel, which attracted numerous people to our table to see it up close. Honestly, the Donut Wheel would have been more than enough for my friends and I to share, but we're greedy.   If the prices were slightly lower and the cooking just a tad bit better, then CATCH will totally fit into the Las Vegas foodie scene.",

The entrance to CATCH is beautiful, make sure to factor in some time before or after your meal to take some photos. Imagine a hallway covered wall to wall with flowers, my friends and I loved it! :)  We were seated right on time, our waiter Attapon was great. He quickly brought out waters and menus. He came back in a bit to take our orders and asked if we had any questions and gave us some recommendations. As a table we ordered the following: - Truffle Sashimi - This comes with Tuna, Hamachi, Chili Oil, Ponzu, Caviar and Black Truffle. The fish was so fresh and the sauce was perfect with it. It comes with four pieces of Tuna and four pieces of Hamachi, it is perfect to share with a group. - Catch 22 Roll - This roll comes with Crab, Salmon and Miso Honey. This presentation of this is super extra, a torch blows fire over the top of each sushi roll piece. There are five pieces total along with ginger and fresh wasabi. These rolls are STUFFED with crab and salmon, they do not skimp.  - Mahi-Mahi Wonton Tacos - This comes with three tacos with Mahi-Mahi, Guacamole, Tomatillo, Pickled Onion and Lime. I was really surprised at how delicious these tacos were... the fish was flavorful and all ingredients were fresh. It is a little messy to eat, but if you order tacos... what do you expect? ;) - Crispy Cauliflower - This comes with Cauliflower with Spicy Vegan Mayo. This was tasty, lots of little bites and so perfect to share with the table.  I have zero critiques or negative commentary on the food or service here. I was super impressed with how quickly the food came out, yet tasted fresh like it was just made for us. I am not sure why this spot has such a low Yelp rating, I had a wonderful experience. The menu is pricey, but it is worth it for the quality of the food. I would definitely recommend CATCH if you want a nice, sit down dinner with delicious food and great service :)",

Not just cause of his name but cause of his recommendations all hit the spot. Did not disappoint!  As long as you have reservation. The hostess got our group sat within 5 minutes or less of checking in.  Ambiance: once you walk-in. It's instagramable. Music is at a decent volume to be able to hear across your table. And it's not thumping edm which is nice. It's definitely a hip vibe with a high end style. Which makes a perfectly night out dinner before going out for more drinks. If you're expecting for high class vibe. It's not the place to be eating at. Overall had a great experience.",

    "text": "Very disappointing experience.  Hostesses were pleasant.  And in general service staff was nice.  Service itself was ok. Why 2 starts ?! 1. Tables super small to fit your food.  2. Place is super loud and overpriced  3. Food was extremely tasteless.  Cauliflower bites had too much sauce.  eggplant skewers - too much sauce. , ceviche - not flavorful  At all.   4. Hand rolls - fish was completely tasteless.  I honestly could not even tell between yellowtail and salmon.  That's how flavorless it was      5. Grilled fish - super overpriced. Super blend and doesn't taste like fresh catch  In general.  Mediocre food below average. Overpriced. Loud place      Unlike other experiences - staff was on point.  Otherwise i would give 1 star.  Will not return",

Note: even though you make a reservation, we still had to wait more than 30 minutes to be seated. So not sure why there is a reservation for specific time slot so just be prepared. Had to knock off a star for this.  Ambiance: as many Instagram posts will show, this place is very nicely decorated starting from the entrance and throughout the entire restaurant. My wife really loved it and there are great spots to take photos! Inside the restaurant the tables are fairly close to one another and noise level is really high. Had to almost yell right across the table just to have a conversation. Another star off. Wish they had more ample space.  Food: our food was delicious! I ordered a variety of sushi dishes and a lobster Mac and cheese. My wife ordered chicken lettuce wraps. Great food but nothing amazing. We also had the HitMe cake since we had seen this to be the most popular dessert item. It's basically a chocolate cake with a Klondike ice cream sandwich on top. Once you crack it the vanilla spreads and makes it so good. Definitely recommend.",

    "text": "Not even sure why im giving this place 2 stars. Maybe because I was really hungry and I ate my food, so they fed me I guess. Lets start off with we had a reservation for 8:45PM for my sisters birthday, which was made way in advance. We arrive at 8:40PM and are told to wait around anywhere, not given a time when we would be seated. With reservations we expected that we would be seated shortly. We walked into the back bar and hungout there since there was no room to stand anywhere up front. After thinking \"How will they know where to find us when our table is ready?\" I decided to go tell them where we would be. They said they didn't need to know amd that someone would come find us when it was time to be seated. Maybe about an hour or so later we were finally seated. Again, not sure what the point of a reservation is. Immediately placed our orders. 5 people total, we expect nice place our food will be brought out together. Wrong. One plate comes out. A few minutes later next persons plate. Few minutes later the same. And so on. First plate out my sisters boyfriend takes a bite and goes \"This is disgusting.\" Ends up ordering something else, ends up having to wait for basically everyone else to be done before his food is out. By that time im hungry again so place another order, because the portions are very small. So basically it was a waiting game. Bot to mention, pretty sure their \"Special\" water is just tap water. Overall crappy experience. We were pretty excited to try the place and expected alot more due to the waiting and high demand. Overpriced below average food. Dont waste your time. Best meal in Vegas by far was In-N-Out.",

There's waaaay better places to eat in Vegas and off the strip. We had reservations at 5:30pm super early before our flight so there's no wait, but we waited for 12 mins standing at the front of the restaurant while a dozen employees and at least 6 hostess chics walked around us. It's like they're still in training. Wtf! The the service here is so so disappointing here especially after having one of the most memorable and delicious eating experiences at Jose Andres \"e\".  The staff her could learn a lot from them. This is just another over priced, wannabe hipster trendy joints that doesn't really know what kind of restaurant it is, so I'm going to try and service you everything and hope something sticks kind of shit hole. We waited 20 mins for 2 out of 7 dishes to come out. Everything has too much sauce. Like it's trying to hide how basic everything is. Waste of calories. There's so much lag I've posted 3x while dining. Our waiter was nice. The truffle sashimi was pretty good. But if if you messed that up, u got real issues. Don't come here. It's a waste of time and money.",

The place is adorned beautifully and I was content when we were told our table was ready.   The food is good, but not impressive.  We ordered truffle sashimi, the catch roll, grilled mahi-mahi, corn,  another sushi roll cannot remember the name, and drinks of course.  The service was prompt and attentive.

The service was great - got menu right away, got drinks quickly.  The ambience was romantic, darkly lighted and loud music.  Really no dress code - some were in jacket/pants and others in t-shirt/shorts.  I do recommend dressing up if you are on a date!  We ordered the \"small seafood tower\" and the entrees were  \"scallop & cauliflower\" and \"herb roasted branzino\" (a sea bass type fish).  The small seafood tower ($100) was delicious but it was actually kind of smallish serving for 2 people (only one king crab leg, one lobster piece, big shrimps, lot of small clams, mussels).  The 2 entrees were $44/each but they were absolutely delicious!  Would definitely come back to this place.",

The table by our side ordered Wagyu cooked tableside...the smoke was so not acceptable and really uncomfortable.  We asked for a comments card at the end of the dinner and the restaurant did not have one. We called the \"manager\" and his response to our comments was literally \"what are you talking about?\" in a very aggressive tone.  A couple of suggestions to this restaurant:  - Don't offer cooked tableside food if you are giving that space between tables. - If that guy was really your manager at that time (04/19/19, 7 pm) I would really reconsider his skills to give a proper customer experience.

For food we pretty much choose everything lobster- the Maine Lobster Avocado hand roll was the BEST roll I've ever had! Flavor town USA and it came with this mango dipping sauce- WOW. This is a must try. SERIOUSLY. Next we had the mahi-mahi Wonton Tacos- excellent! The tacos had so much flavor- yum!! Next we had the lobster mashed potatoes again delicious! There are big chunks of lobster it in! Finally we ended with the lobster Mac and Cheese! Also very good! It's not your typical mac & cheese with cheddar cheese.  The decor was great I love that there are flowers everywhere in multiple places to take great pictures.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone!!!

The wait to be seated was a bit annoying, even though we were on time for our reservation. But the manager made it up to us by seating us in one of those super cute birdcage booths. We were in for a late/light dinner, so didn't try as much on the menu as I would've liked to. But everything was great!   P.S.: Order the popcorn shrimp!",

I can learn and train myself to be a better agent but i can also have fun (and deduct this trip on taxes lol)  When i was booking my reservation @_ Aria the concierge lady told me about this new place and how hard it was to get in and if you know me then you know that i am a sucker for food so yep! I booked a table here with 3 weeks in advance.  Here the reviews:  -Ambience: super super super cute entrance with flowers and so instagram friendly!   -Service: my waiter was nice and friendly. Expect to wait 10-15 minutes even if you have a reservation.   -Food:  *Truffle Sashimi ($33) Good flavor! I like the sauce! However i still prefer Nobus Yellowtail Jalapeno for $25 :) (Hawaii pr  *MRC Roll ($22)  *Corn ($11) Its ok, i think for corn, nothing beats a street kind.  *Scallop Gnocchi ($29) It was ok.  *Grilled spanish octopus ($25) Octopus was tender, i would have preferred the octopus to be cut in thinner slices.  Overall, this place wasnt bad but its not WOW either :/",

Oh and it's so loud, I had to shout so that my husband can hear me. Now I know, always trust yelp reviews. Not at all a good date night place.",

The bun is buttered perfectly and the flavor from the fresh lobster was amazing. The lobster mash was also great. Fresh and handmade potatoes. Amazing. The crispy shrimp was also great and very filling. Lots of flavor and delicious. The mahi mahi Wonton Tacos were okay. I wasn't a huge fan but they were just okay. Service was great. The reason why 4 stars and not 5. The prices. They are a bit steep. Some plates were kinda small portions. I understand it's Vegas and all. Overall great food though.",

I was sitting underneath the stunning chandelier at CATCH...yes, it was moving beautifully from side to side.  Upon arriving at Catch, before you get to the reception desk, you will pass the picturesque arrangement of flowers and colorful decor. I'm sure you've seen several social media posts of this gorgeous spot. Once past reception, you are led to one of  the multiple dining areas, all organized for maximum seating...which also means that on a full night, you can forget about making sense of any conversation at your table.  We ordered about ten dishes to share between three of us. A combination of seafood, meat, vegetables, and carbs...everything was tasty, but not so special as to be deserving of either the high price or the hype. Suffice it to say, there are a lot of better options in town if you want to be wowed by what you are eating.  Unfortunately, the service didn't do anything to make up for the less-than-memorable food. At its heart, it was a little unorganized. For example, as soon as we set, they delivered 2 appetizers which we thought would be complimentary, but it was just a mistake, and they took them to the right table. Additionally, there were many staff members, but it was not easy to have them over when you needed anything, on account of it being so loud and busy...almost like fine dining price with overcrowded casual service.  Would I come back intentionally...no.",

    "text": "After seeing Catch on many celebrity/social media influencer's stories, this restaurant was on my must-try list for the hubby & I's getaway trip to Vegas for the weekend. We had made a reservation for 7:15, but got there at about 6:50. With our spare time, I made sure to take pictures in the iconic hallway that Catch is known for -- in retrospect I would have taken our pictures then gone elsewhere for dinner.  The hostess called us & had us seated by 7:00. She led us to this tiny table, & even had to move it to the side to let me in because there wasn't space between us & the other couple's table to walk through. The lighting is low to the point it was hard to read the menu, & between the loud music & close proximity to the other tables it was hard to hear our own conversation.   Neither of us were terribly hungry so we ordered two dishes to share, the Catch Roll & Grilled Octopus. For $23, the Catch Roll was mediocre at best. I've had better rolls for $10 at any other sushi place. The Grilled Octopus however was DIVINE. It was perfectly paired with crispy potatoes & a garlic aioli. Hubby & I still talk about how delicious it was & how we wish we could find a similar dish in Denver. We finished it off with the famous Hit Me Cake... also unimpressive. Although the presentation was fabulous, the taste was lacking. Sweet, rich chocolately desserts are my guilty pleasure, but it was not to my satisfaction at all.  All in all, after spending over $100 on dinner & drinks, I was disappointed that the food wasn't WOW material. If we ever go back to Vegas, maybe we'll think about coming back to Catch only for more insta-worthy pictures, and the Grilled Octopus. Otherwise, we'll be fine dining elsewhere!",

I've been to the rooftop Los Angeles location before and had a great time so I most certainly wanted to try out their Vegas restaurant.   First off- the photo opps from the decor alone is beautiful. Very green, floral and romantic. Our waiter and service was amazing. He gave great recommendations on chef specials that weren't in the menu that were utterly magnificent.   Im not entirely sure what the names were to some of the dishes that were served to us but from what I remember we had the crispy shrimp,  grilled octopus, coconut cake,  wagu pot stickers, and some sushi that was out of this world, melt in your mouth good.  I'd love to come back and work my way through the menu!",

Started with cocktails and their drink menus has many choices.  Chose the meatpacking Manhattan, loved it.  We sampled five different dishes and were please all of our choices.  Favorite was the Alaskan King Crab tempura - best dish on the menu.  Also had the filet which was tender and well seasoned. Brussels sprouts were savory and perfectly seasoned.  The lobster mac & cheese was heavy and not a favorite.",

The grand entrance is the first thing that catches your eye. Its gorgeous flowers and colors are instagram worthy. Be sure to arrive early for your reservations to take pictures. Or better yet, come before dinner service so there isn't a crowd.   The food was top notch! The skewers were flavorful and a beautiful roasted aroma. Try the roasted corn, eggplant and beef filet mignon. The wagyu gyoza and mahi mahi tacos were a fresh twist on the usual comfort food. I love how the mahi is mixed in with guacamole so you get every flavor in each bite. The king crab tempura & mushroom spaghetti were delicious; There were so much more to write about, you just have to try it for yourself.   Our server Courtney was outstanding! She anticipated our every need and refreshed our drinks regularly. As packed as it was she was always available and was not flustered at all. Definitely a pro! We got to personally thank Chef Adrain Vela for the wonderful meal. Very sad to lose him from LA but we are so happy to visit his new home in Vegas and can't wait to return!",

I've seen there was some issues with this earlier and glad to see it's been worked through.   We asked the waiter to course out a meal for me and my 6 guests and gave him a price point. Everything was excellent. Just enough for everyone to get a taste without feeling overly fed.   The atmosphere was great, music and even the GM Jason stopped by to make sure we were having a wonderful experience.   We will definitely be back. I'd suggest anyone looking to host a small get together to make this place your go to restaurant!",

    "text": "Catch as of the time of writing this review is the newest restaurant at Aria replacing their previous Japanese restaurant. We've been here several times now and always had a reservation. There's plenty of seating but I would book ahead of time to be safe especially if you have a large party and it happens to be a busy weekend.   The restaurant serves a variety of foods and everything we've had has always been delicious. Some of their dishes such as their scallop gnocchi while flavorful was slightly lacking in texture. Their lobster mac is excellent. Their large entrees are all top notch.   The price here is not cheap. If you want to eat your fill, with a drink, appetizer, entree, expect $70+ per person.  Service has always been good as is the ambience.  My biggest gripe was our last visit we ordered some cut rolls to-go. They were nothing like the ones I've ordered while dining in. They are amongst the worst quality rolls I've ever seen. I was extremely disappointed.   Nonetheless the overall food quality is great. I will edit this review should the quality tank in future visits.",

Thank you to Francis, Operations Manager, for your superb professional attention to care and detail. Thank you to Clarissa for explaining the varied menu to us in detail! You are the perfection! The venue is exquisite, very contemporary and the vibe is very upbeat. Beautifully decorated, there are several perfect photo op spots throughout. We dined on delicious octopus and tuna; the signature plate - The Catch 22 is superb and flamed table side!!! The octopus and avocado roll is delicious! Everything about this dining experience was perfect. Business casual attire also added to the delight of the night! Great bar area with booths and high tops- great dining areas as well, open sushi bar too! All exceptional! Don't miss this experience!",

We were asked to leave and to pay for food that had not come out yet. 450$ bill and the manager himself forcibly removed our plates that were untouched. Horrible experience would never return to this location. The music was blasting and the restaurant was packed like a nightclub yet the manager said we were being loud. I wrote to corporate office and didn't get a reply. I am utterly disappointed with the actions of the management of this establishment.",

The place is beautiful and almost all the dishes I got were stellar. I could see people getting pissed about the waiting time after talking to the hostesses, but to me it is always about the food and the service is a nice plus.  The space between tables can be quite reduced and can be a little annoying to overhear other people's conversations, but the loud music should take care of that.   Only dishes I would avoid as they were very mediocre are the mango shrimp roll and the catch ceviche. The salmon belly carpaccio is amazing, same goes for the branzino with creamy basmati rice, hamachi spinach, Spanish octopus and the donut wonder wheel for desert as the cake donuts had an amazing texture and flavor.",

First of all we arrive to the restaurant and they ask us if we want to drink fiji, tap or pellegrino we ask for tap they bring us the water and the glasses smell like fish we ask to the busser can you change the glasses he respond yes and he bring us \"new glasses\" the glasses still smelling like fish.  What's the answer to that?  The stocker is polishing with a dirty rag. Change the rag put soap and that's it!  We tell the server hey can you bring us plastic cups and accidently she bring dirty plastic cups with stains of tomato juice that look like lipstick in the plastic cup.   And we honestly understand those kind of accidents because we work in the restaurant business. Server was great busser too actually we left the 20% tip because they were good!   But here is the interesting part, we call to the manager because we were celebrating the birthday of my friend.   My friend  is a hotel manager in  Colorado, and she know how to treat people.   Well we tell the busser can you call to your manager?    The manager get in our table with the worst face and a terrible attitude.  Her words were: what happen? We tell her the story and she said \"mm maybe someone spilt tomato juice in the plastic cups or whatever\"  That was her answer and she leave!  Oh she just send us a Fiji and we appreciate!   But that's not the way you treat people specially if we are celebrating a birthday and choosing catch as an option.",

    "text": "Disclaimer - this review may be biased because I love Vegas and I absolutely love Aria and I've been this location 4 times in the last 4 trips.  So here it goes - this place is awesome. Yes, it is probably pricey, but what upscale place isn't? Yes, this place is loud, but it's just because the atmosphere is so upbeat that everyone is just having fun. Yes, the portion sizes maybe a bit small, but it just means we get to order more things and try all their different flavors.  So the bottom line is that if you want to have a great time, and be served by a really nice and hospitable staff, and even end your meals with a nice dessert, and be present in a great crowd - this is definitely the place to be. In fact, I'd even go as far as demanding everyone to try it out at least once!!",

The only reason why I give it three stars rather than less is - the shrimp starter was delicious, the prosecco I had to drink was great and our waitress (even though she had to shout to be heard) was kind and attentive and food came out on time. I did feel a bit rushed though, and it is not a place for a romantic meal. I'm not big into image and if I get dressed up it's a big deal for me. I put on my best dress, make up etc for this and was out in 45 mins, all that time my husband and I didn't speak because we couldn't hear each other with the noise!

Just feels like the attitude of this place is that you are lucky to be there. We were seated a good 30-40 min after our reservation without so much as an apology or recognition of the situation. Service was fairly subpar as well as my wife was brought the wrong wine and the kitchen neglected to send out one of our sushi rolls. For the price you pay at this place, you expect to be treated as a welcome guest and we did not feel that at all.   We will take our money elsewhere in the future.",

We walk in through the magically lit flower pathway, and the hostess tells me that our table was given away and she doesn't care who I spoke with, but we could sit at the sushi bar instead, but would have to wait. We were really looking forward to eating here, so we waited, walked away for 2 minutes to take a picture with friends in front of the CATCH sign and she scolded us for walking away, and had us wait some more. We did enjoy the food, which was creative and delicious. But such a shame that the hostess, who I was told was also the manager, is the worst welcoming committee EVER :-(",

Once were were finally seated (we had a 6:00 reservation but didn't get seated until 6:20) our waiter, who was very engaging, took our drink order.  I had a margarita which was very good.  They had a pretty extensive wine and cocktail selection as well.  For dinner I had the wagyu short rib tacos which were absolutely PHENOMENAL.  Everybody else in our party loved their entrees as well.  The only other complaint I have is how long it took to get our food and it didn't all come out together so one person in our party didn't eat until 20 minutes after everyone else!  The manager was also very lovely and came by our table to check on us, as well as give our daughter a great birthday dessert spread.  Would I return to Catch?  Absolutely.",

Our waiters were fine but the place was so loud we couldn't have any conversations and couldn't even hear what we were all ordering.  Which is a big problem for a restaurant that wants to serve all the food family style.  The food came out in random order -- sides came last.  We had to leave early before some food even arrived, because the whole thing took so long (had a show to get to).  Bill was about $1500.  The food that we actually ate was great. I would probably return as a party of 2 so I could potentially sit right next to the person and hear him or her.",

I really liked how one of the waiters gave my sister and I menu suggestions! I tried the short rib wagyu tacos, the mo'jito mo'problems, and the s'mores pizza. Although, I'm not a fan of mayo, the tacos were really good! The aioli and the pineapples balanced the flavors out really well. I played it safe with the mojito; it was pretty good but I wish I ordered the 'one too many' instead. I didn't really care for the s'mores pizza either. Within a few minutes, the marshmallows became super hard making it hard to chew on. All in all, I'm giving the restaurant 3/5 stars because of my food experience. It was pretty good overall but I expected bigger portions for the prices. I'd definitely recommend this restaurant if you're a foodie fan who loves seafood and sushi!",

Made a reservation for a birthday celebration and once we arrived at the check-in counter we were made to wait about 10 minutes after our reservation time. Table that they had a seating at was extremely close next to other tables. I have never seen a layout in a strip restaurant down like this we were sitting so close to the couple next to us,almost feel like you were in New York City restaurant. And the food was delicious that's the only plus side to this restaurant but unfortunately with a horrible customer service who will not be making it back or recommend it to anyone. Have to ask the server twice for lemon for a waters and at the end of our trip still did not receive lemon for the water. The table set up was so tiny that the food that we ordered we couldn't even use the plates we had to eat the food off the plates that the food was brought on. In the reservation request I let them know that I would this was a birthday celebration and neither did the front office ever say happy birthday or the server for such high-quality restaurants that's usually how they provide the type of service so something that they should definitely look into paying attention to detail. Once were done with our dinner the server never brought out a complementary happy birthday dessert that they usually do it at all the fine dining establishments on the strip which is another key point that this restaurant does not pay attention to details at all. People that work in the restaurant we're on their cell phones throughout the whole time so if management is ever catching up to these reviews and trying to save this restaurant from ever closing should completely revamp their staff.",

I had heard and seen - plus I have friends who work at Aria that said it looks like a great restaurant - so I had to give a try. I don't know how to describe it really it's just a great atmosphere, they have a pretty elaborate menu but the staff gave phenomenal service in walking me through it. The drinks are well crafted you can tell they put effort into the mixology and the flavor profiles they wanted. My girlfriend and I were blown away. Miguel ( waiter) was extremely friendly, upbeat, and didn't care that it was busy I still felt prioritized. Joey ( manager I believe) came by a couple times helped discuss the menu with me, wished me a happy birthday and we took his recommendations on what to order for our main course. He made a great impression on me and my girlfriend for being genuine. A lot of managers always walk by and ask how's everything going etc - that's what managers do right - but Joey actually asked with a purpose it wasn't like it was a fake routine or just because it was my birthday he did it the right way. Thank you Catch for crushing it. Can not wait to come back.",

The decor and atmosphere were beyond beautiful but the food and service have a lot of catching up to do. This is not a cheap restaurant by any means, but it is also very new, so I didnt know what to expect. We made our reservations for 20 ahead of time and they still weren't prepared for us when we got there. After we sat down ordering was super difficult. It seemed as though the staff had never worked in a high volume upscale restaurant. We ordered our first round of drinks, which came out perfect, however it took 15 minuets and my asking of 3 people before I received my second drink. Also the food was pretty salty, if your sushi is salty without to the soy sauce, there's an issue haha. Also 2 people at my table never received their entrees and the server never noticed. For as much as they're charging I really hope they step it up, because as of right now it's not worthy of being a Las Vegas Strip restaurant.",

Initially, it seemed like the waiter didn't have time for us because we ordered a few small plates. I guess he assumed that's all we would order which wasn't the case. We even asked to keep the menu, which I thought implied we were not finished ordering. The service improved once we ordered a couple of the $100+ menu items. Maybe that's just a coincidence. From observing the atmosphere it was clear that the wait staff is still working out some kinks as it's opening week. Each time a food runner would come out of the kitchen they looked lost. They had no idea which table ordered what. There were three instances where the food runners tried to serve us food we didn't order. The first two times we let them know it wasn't ours and by the third time, I assumed it was just compliments of the chef. Overall it was a nice experience and I will return. The porterhouse, Alaskan king crab legs, and scallops were my favorites. The tiger prawns were good also. The entry way is beautiful and a great backdrop for photos.",

    "text": "My husband and I went CATCH on Oct 29 that was their Las Vegas  (at Aria Hotel) opening night. It was our anniversary and we were looking forward to celebrating our important day with some memorable dinner. We were planning to have a dinner somewhere else, but we walked by Aria in the afternoon Oct 29  and found out that CATCH's Opening day, Ok why don't we try them? So I made a reservation at 9:45 PM. BUT it was a huge mistake.   1. They lost our 9:45 pm reservation and the receptionist didn't even apologize to us and she just said, \" Well, you can still eat it. \"  What a nice way to welcome the customers on their first day of the opening.  2. They took us to a table next to the bar counter; a small table with two stools. I asked the receptionist to change the table because this was an important day for us and we didn't want to spend our anniversary sitting at the bar. We dressed up very nice for our anniversary...  why would they seat us at the bar instead of the main dining area? There were many open tebles for late dinner.  3. The most disappointing thing was the food... it was TERRIBLE.  Everything is very salty and boring.   I am Japanese and I KNOW good Sashimi and sushi. Their signature dish (that's what the waiter said) Trifle (oil) sashimi was way too oily and salty, overkilled Sashimi flavor. It totally ruined the test of the fish.  Spinach Octopus was too soggy and salty. And Herb_rosted branzino, the skin was not crispy enough and no flavor. The creamy vegetable basmati was again, way too salty.  I even told a waiter to let his chefs know about it.  4. And their cocktails were not memorable or exciting.  This is my impression on their Las Vegas Opening. Instead of spending a lot of money to pay to celebrities to promote their restaurant as trendy, they need to focus on getting the best chefs, so they can deliver quality food and service. My impression of Catch is that it was very shallow... its all about the look but there is no depth. I don't even know how they can survive with that poor quality in Las Vegas.",

Dont they know they are the first impressions for the restaurant. I guess they just dont give a fickery fuk. They gave me attitude when I asked if my table was ready 30 mins past my reservations. Umm bish, Im the one that should have an attitude. Then they dont even apologize for the wait when they finally decide to seat us 45 mins later.   Waiter: he was nice, but poorly trained in the \"fancy\" service restaurant that they tryna portray. The service here felt very Cheesecake Factory. Actually, let me not insult the Cheesecake Factory.  Food: the crispy shrimp is exactly like the honey walnut shrimp from panda express.  The mushroom pasta came with cheap ol button mushrooms. The 3/$20 short ribs tacos were the size of a babies hand and all I tasted was salt. Sushi good. Sashimi good. The branzino the waiter recommended blah. Ceviche hella watery.  Drinks: good but the bartenders are super understaffed. Took 15 mins to order and another 15 to pay. This 30min bar experience was part of my 45 mins table wait.  *alternative suggestions- beauty and essex, China poblano, momofuku, lemongrass, the new food court at cosmo, ghost donkey, wynn buffet, basically anywhere but Catch.  Yo gurl aint tryna get caught.",

Every single sushi roll was incredible as well. If I had any negatives it would be to make the lobster Mac and cheese a little more cheesy and that we had to wait 30 minutes after our reservation time.

The restaurant was not busy but the hostess thought a good idea to sit us in a section with two other couples side by side! We couldn't help but hear both conversations. My husband asked to change of table to another almost empty section. The hostess was annoyed by our request and after 10min she said that she might be able to find us another in another 30min (in the nearly empty restaurant). My husband declined and ask her how could we avoid this and she said that the customer did not had the choice of where they can sit!!! So we left!  She was surprised that we didn't stay. Well I guess the bad reviews were True about the hostess treating the diners as gum under her shoe!  Good luck for the longevity for this restaurant !  Las Vegas has tons of great restaurants who know how to welcome their guests.   We went instead at Blossom and had a superb meal with an outstanding service!!",

That was definitely annoying to have to wait that long after we had reservations. They then proceeded to take us into a side room that wasn't even part of the restaurant. I think it might've been their private dining room but none the less we were stuck in a mute, dark, non decor area. The restaurant part was very open and beautiful which we weren't able to enjoy . The food was ok  but nothing that really blew me out of the water. We ordered a dozen oysters, truffle sashimi, ny strip steak, king crab, lobster mash, Brussels, gnocchi, and coconut dessert. Our waiter forgot the gnocchi due to miscommunication  they also forgot to give us chopsticks for the sushi and didn't give us a drop plate or bucket to put our king crab shells in. Had to ask for all these and when they cleaned our table after we were done with our main before dessert they didn't replace our napkins. They also don't have steamed towelettes for cleaning your hands after the crab which is a bit bizarre. All in all I'd definitely recommend checking out the restaurant. Probably more so for drinks and apps then a full dinner. I'd rather go to John George or sage if I were to dine in.  The entry way is divine and definitely makes for one hell of an entry way. That was my favorite part of the night.",

    "text": "First off- Catch is more of a club than a fine dining experience & the pricing is high but normal Vegas/casino restaurant high.  The vibe is very young & hip, the environment  is VERY loud & busy- you will almost be screaming to carry a conversation with those at your table.   Service was slightly above average- I did have to ask for water at one point.   It seems like they may be overbooking their seating/tables per Yelp reviews & people we heard complaining at the hostess booth; mostly struggling with bigger parties.   They don't seem to immediately seat anyone upon arrival, instead they direct them to an overly busy bar area- where it's near impossible to get a cocktail while you wait to be seated; we opted to step out to Lobby Bar for one since we had about 20mins to kill. My friend had a water when we came back & we were informed he couldn't bring it in- even tho the bar was so packed & our table may not even be ready yet....seems petty & silly since the establishment is inside a hotel, but whatever.   The food was fantastic, for the most part:  *Steak melted in your mouth.  *Lobster mashed potatoes were good, but I've had better *Red Snapper was cooked perfectly *Brussle sprouts (recommended by server) came out 10+ mins after our entrees & were over-cooked to me, tasted burnt.   *Decent wine selection We skipped dessert- it was just too loud & I was ready to get out.   The decor is nice & fun, flower tunnle entrance & all.   This could be a fun place to celebrate birthdays & such with friends but I wouldn't say it's peaceful or romantic, it is however Vegas-y so having a cocktail or two before arriving is helpful.",

We didn't get to eat our main course Red snapper because it didn't showed up. Wow this place is unbelievably bad. Checked in at 5:30 for our 6pm reservation and yet they tried to seat us between 2 other guests like they are running out of space and it's not even the main dinning room. Then they moved us. Look at the picture. Really? Do you want to have dinner side by side on this small table?",

Bad news; They have sushi, they have bao buns, they have pasta, they have mahi tacos, they have steak.... they have everything and none of its good.  Recommendation pick one thing and do it well!  The menu is all over the place.  Bottom line place is culinarily challenged and the food reflects that.    What we ordered: 0/10 CEViCHE , awful.  Seafood did not taste fresh and sauce was poorly balanced.  Way too sweet and not enough acidity.  Just blah.  4/10 ROASTED BEETS, salty.  Lettuce was soggy and foam was not foam it looked like mouse.  6/10 GRILLED OCTOPUS, chewy.  Not tender, tasted like beef jerky almost fried instead of grilled.  The fried potatoes in spicy pepper cream sauce was good.  4/10 MAHI TACOS- unappetizing.  Besides being overly salty I liked the crunch and fresh lime juice.  The appearance of the mahi filling looks like frog that's been food processed.  Only ate one.    2/10 SCALLOP GNOCCI TRUFFLE, loss of words.  How do you take 3 of the best ingredients and make such a bad dish.  Well they did it.  This is a dish raved by other reviewers and I can't understand why.  The gnocci and scallops are served in a herbed salt water with very little truffle.  The gnocci is pillowy and has great texture that's it.  The scallops are gummy and flavorless.    Dessert 6/10 VEGAN PISTACHIO CHEESECAKE, not bad.  Good texture gave this a shot despite having any dairy restrictions or allergies.  Coconut sorbet was refreshing.  Overall not bad.",

    "text": "Catch was a very fun place to dine. The atmosphere is beautiful walking down the hall into the restaurant, as well as in the dining areas. It was really breathtaking. So to begin with, the service and the food was all delicious. But not so ideal for me. When the server arrives he/she says that they would rather you put in your entire order at once and \"it'll just come out when it's ready\". I eat slowly and like to enjoy small bites at a time with my wine so I really was not at all a fan of that. Also, the tables and seating is absolutely ridiculous. If the host has to move the table over so that a guest can get into their seat because the table next to them is that close, that's a HUGE issue. What if that guest needs to use the restroom during their meal and the tables next to them have been sat...... how the heck are they gonna be able to get out????????? Management needs to fix this immediately. Not only that, but if we are supposed to order everything at once and it ends up all coming out within maybe 2-3 minutes of each other, it doesn't all fit on the dang table. Like really!?!?! MOST DEFINITELY NEEDS TO MAKE A TON OF ADJUSTMENTS!  Now when it comes to the food, everything was pretty good. The catch ceviche we both thought was amazing. I loved the fresh mangos and blood orange slices, very light and refreshing. We also ordered the catch roll, which was a crab salad roll with salmon on top that the server torched at the table. This dish was our favorite. From the hot appetizer section we ordered the crispy shrimp which was so yummy! It was similar to bang bang shrimp but 100% better. The last item we ordered was a side of the crispy Brussels sprouts. They were average, most definitely not the best I have.   Maybe because they are new they are still working out the kinks but lots of improvement is needed. I very much so hope that management will see this and realize changes need to be made.",

The food was absolutely EXQUISITE with intense flavors and beautiful presentation -- that had us saying, \"wow\" with every bite!   Highly recommend:  - TRUFFLE SASHIMI: tuna, hamachi, chili oil, ponzu, caviar, black truffle (wow, this was heaven in fish form!) - CATCH CEVICHE: alaskan king crab, main lobster, shrimp, scallop, mango, blood orange ponzu (so incredibly fresh!) - HAMACHI SPINACH: yellowtail, crispy spinach, shallot, sweet ponzu  - GRILLED SPANISH OCTOPUS: octopus, crispy potatoes, sofrito, garlic aioli  - LOBSTER MAC & CHEESE: maine lobster, mascarpone, breadcrumbs, parmesan (can you really go wrong with this?!) - SCALLOP GNOCCHI: bay scallops, black truffle, parmesan  - MUSHROOM SPAGHETTI: wild mushroom, sugar snap peas, tomato, parmesan (this was recommended to us -- and wow, did not disappoint!) - COOKIE DOUGH SPRING ROLLS: cookie dough filled spring rolls with a cookies & cream fondue for dipping (this was SO good!!!) - HIT ME CHOCOLATE CAKE: liquid klondike, dulce de leche ice cream, brownie & devil's food  - STICKY COCONUT CAKE: coconut cake, coconut water sorbet, mango sauce (the presentation of this was amazing!)  This place is in a league of it's own & exudes total fabulousness! It was the perfect choice for a birthday dinner... BIG THANK YOU TO JASON & OUR SERVER ED FOR THE AMAZING HOSPITALITY! We will definitely be back!",

Joseph was our server both times and we ended up requesting him the second visit. Joseph has excellent knowledge of all the food and cocktails on the menu. We tried the one too many and the watermelon felon to start the night off.  We highly recommend coming here if you are visiting town or have friends who want a unique experience in Las Vegas. This is a great spot for celebrating, and the food is served in a family style setting. We ordered many dishes and everyone was able to share. Portions are solid, and you won't be leaving hungry. The entrance is magical and sets the mood for the entire dining experience.  Will be returning in the future and of course ask for Joseph. Hands down best service! Also recommend the crispy shrimp, one of my favorite dishes.",

The taste of truffles, lobster and crispness of the fried snapper all made this trip worthwhile.  I have admit, walking through the forest to get into the restaurant was rather chilling, as we photographed some wings left behind and surely caught up in the moment.  The appetizers are fresh and dainty, but full of flavor.  Fish was the main course obviously, but was certainly not the highlight of the evening, when my wife was presented with her birthday dessert.  My concern, however, is having too many reception personnel, or hostesses, which seems to detract from a business perspective.  They were nice, but I could tell, they were still learning the ropes.  first impressions are everything...",

I ordered grilled swordfish which was over cooked and dry. My husband ordered the roasted branzino which he said was good. However, it was served over a cloyingly sweet basmati rice dish. They didn't go together. He had grilled octopus for his appetizer which was tough. Octopus can be tough, but it doesn't have to be. If you want good octopus at the Aria, go to Julian Serrano. On top of the food problems, the wine list is ridiculously expensive, even by Las Vegas standards. The restaurant is also very noisy.  There are so many good restaurants in Las Vegas. This isn't one of the best.",

However, the music was a mixture of 90s and early 2000s and current r&b and rap, so I'm not complaining at all.

We just wanted to try out a few drinks so we sat right at the bar, it was very busy however we were able to sit right away at the bar. The boyfriend and I ordered a few drinks and spied as others ordered food around us.

The waiter unfortunately was very inappropriate and rude. Prior to being seated, I privately asked to direct all inquiries about payment to me privately. The waiter insisted on mentioning payment throughout the entire dinner to the whole party. It was quite uncomfortable for all the guests. As older women they have different taste preferences and instead of directing them to the best food choices to meet their needs he talked down to them and made them feel quite small. I am appalled by this experience! I would recommend that you take photos in the front of Catch and skip out on dinning.",

Left before we ordered anything . Too many good restaurants in Vegas to be treated this way",

Although everything was decent we weren't blown away by the food. I'm originally from Toronto Canada and I have had muuuuuch better for less price. Would I go here again? Probably not, it's a nice experience though.",

    "text": "My boyfriend took me here this past Friday for my 28th birthday. We made a reservation a few days ahead, gave my name, hostess asked if there was a special occasion, said my birthday and we arrived on time.   The hostess didn't have my name and when I remembered I gave my phone number my reservation was listed as Daphney instead of Stefanie. The hostess walked us to the table I was shocked to see how close the two tops were. I asked the hostess if we could sit somewhere else and she said all the two tops for couples are like this and we would have to go back to the hostess stand. Since we made a reservation, I was concerned there were going to tell us the same thing so I didn't want to walk back to the front.   The tables are TOO CLOSE to each other and it is very uncomfortable because you literally hear the other couples' conversations. Come to see later there was a couple at a 4 top booth.. very disrespectful to position couples could only sit at two tops. The waitress asked for drinks and when we received them, I ordered a melon felon I believe and I was surprised how washed down it tasted. Waitress position it's because it is fresh watermelon juice. (We had fresh watermelon juice at the High Limits Lounge and that drink had more watermelon flavor) so when we ordered our food at the two tops, there's a stand to reach over to take your food off because the table is so small... if felt claustrophobic and inappropriate to know we spend around $200 for dinner and you are almost elbow to elbow with other customers and then you reach at the height of your face to get the food. Whereas the other tables don't have this stand concept.   After our 5th plate, we knew we had swordfish and the truffle fries coming out, but we were full. So we decided we just wanted to cancel the fries and just have the swordfish. We asked the waitress to cancel the fries and she said she can't if they are already on their way... I was shocked to hear this because this isn't True. Especially I used to serve and I saw the POS system is Agilysys. You just highlight the item you want to void, select the action to void and have a manager override the void to process it. I asked her to try to because we are full but don't mind the swordfish to come out which was around $40 and the fries were around $18 so it was a high ticket item. Swordfish was dry but we just wanted to make the best and keep if positive for my birthday. Behind my boyfriend I saw a waiter lighting a candle for someone's birthday and when we asked our waitress she said we had to pay for the desert. It was disappointing because when they ask the occasion to make a reservation, if comes across like there's a hospitality aspect to welcome the guest in.   Even at STK, (reference the aspect of another high price restaurant) where I've had Kobe steak for $40 an ounce gave me a free birthday desert so I don't see there's  genuine hospitality and attention to detail at Catch. We had such classy hospitable service at the High Limits Lounge than we did here.",

    "text": "We had asked around about the best steak restaurant in LV, but ended up here on a strong recommendation from a friend.  The table right next to ours was shining the flashlights from their phones the whole meal. Like the whole entire meal non-stop. We get it. It was dark, but once you finish ordering, turn the flashlight off.   We told two servers, and a manager. Nobody did anything about it.  We paid our bill and told our server that we were frustrated because nothing was done about the bright lights that kept bobbing into our eyes. He finally sent over the GM.   The GM immediately got defensive and literally yelled at us. He brought up the fact that 'in this day and age everyone is on their phones'. But we were upset about the flashlights, not phone screens.   We just wanted someone to say sorry or even acknowledge the frustration we had.   The GM went on to loudly and angrily ask if we were \"just trying to get free stuff\".   For a restaurant called Catch, we were impressed that our porterhouse was great, BUT our experience was TERRIBLE. It is incredibly frustrating to be talked to in this manner.  I ended up having to pull the manager aside, explain that his behaviour was very confrontational and basically empathize with him! And we still didn't get an apology.   Next time we will stick with Jean Georges or avoid Aria altogether.",

    "text": "I dined at Catch with 3 friends for my cousin's birthday dinner. Food was mediocre and our waiter was very rude. We were sat in the lounge room which had a all male staff.  They wore cool fisherman inspired uniforms and the ambiance was very laid back. Things were looking good until our waiter came along.   The waiter was very dismissive, nor was he good at explaining anything on the menu and he could hardly be bothered to respond to questions about  it. He had a nasty attitude and was just overall very pretentious. Just because of him I wanna give Catch 0 stars because he really ruined the entire dinner and brought down the vibe of the group. Service can really make or break the whole dining experience, and ours was most certainly broken.   I would not eat here again or recommend this restaurant to anyone. We ordered lobster Mac and cheese; Which lacked cheese, depth of flavor and was dry. It was a weird brown/reddish color and tasted like a flavorless lobster pasta made with cheap elbow macaroni noodles.   The ceviche tasted fresh and the scallop gnocchi was flavorful enough. We also ordered the snapper which lacked flavor, as did the bed of lobster mashed potatoes it was served atop of. With so many amazing high end restaurants in Las Vegas Catch was a True disappointment.",

    "text": "I had been wanting to dine at Catch both in New York and Los Angeles for years. For one reason or another, I never did and I was so excited to learn that Catch was opening up at Aria where I always stay when I'm in Vegas. My fiance and I were there one weekend while I was on a work trip. Coincidentally, his mother and her best friend were also there the same weekend. We were looking for a fine dining experience, and we were all ready to try Catch in its new location. We were able to make a reservation easily online via OpenTable. We made our reservation for 6 PM and we got there a little bit early. As you enter, it is pretty magical. They did a beautiful job dressing up the place. It's a beautiful flowery, garden-like entrance. See photos for reference. We took a few photos on our way in, and then approached the hostess stand. She said that they wouldn't be able to seat anyone until 6 PM so she recommended we grab a few drinks at the bar. The bar area is also gorgeous. They have great craft cocktail options. The bartender was really great and whipped us up a round of cocktails quickly. We finally went over to the dining area and there were very few people there as they had just opened. All of the tables were open, yet we were seated at a small table in a corner. I asked if we could be seated in one of the bigger booths and the hostess said something very bizarre. She said that we, our entire party would have to walk back to the front of the restaurant toward the hostess stand to see if that was a possibility. I really didn't understand why our entire party would have to do that and not just the hostess, so we all made the walk over there, the hostess said \"yes,\" and we all walked back. Really dumb if you ask me. Also, not the best introduction to the restaurant. She also told us that we would need to be out by 7 PM if we took this table. We didn't expect that we would be there that long so it wasn't an issue, except for the fact that we felt like we were being hurried out of there. We did love our table, we were greeted almost right away by our server who was very kind the entire time. He explained the menu and made a few recommendations. We were all starving and we are all seafood lovers so no matter what, we would likely enjoy almost anything. They also had a few specials, one of which my fiance's mom and her friend ordered. It was the king crab leg. My fiance and I ordered a fish entree as well as a few sushi rolls to share. There is a tilted tabletop platter on each table, I like the idea - kind of like a pizza place, but they were very wobbly and not very functional. They were more in the way than anything else. All of our food came out at once so it went from having nothing on the table to having way too much. It wasn't really coursed out. In fact, the entire experience was very rushed. Almost as if they were trying to get us out of there. Also, they kept grabbing stuff from our table that wasn't finished. I had a third of a martini (and those things are expensive), one of the girls tried to take it away and I had to tell her I wasn't done. Also, on to several occasions they tried to take our food off the table and it wasn't done. Restaurant serving-etiquette states that you should always ask if they can take a plate away even if there's only crumbs. Overall, I was unimpressed by Catch because of the hurried nature, the taking away of food, and the weird hostess incident. Maybe I'll return for a cocktail at the bar, but definitely not worth the expense of dinner.",

One of the hostesses very kindly scoped out a seat for us at the bar (I think there are several, we went to the one in back).   Truffle sashimi--killer. Small(er) portion, as expected. The fish was absolutely as good as I've ever had, and I would have eaten a bowl of hair if they poured the truffle sauce over it. Really really great.   Chicken bao--good, but I'd skip it next time. Essentially it was Asian Chick-Fil-A. I love chick fil a, but I'm not sure it belongs here. Chicken was cooked perfectly, buns were great, no complaints about the dish at all.   Kabayaki corn--. I've had a lot of corn in a lot of places, and this was the best I've ever had. We were scared to order it because, well, corn teeth. The kernels almost fell off the core and the sauce was, just, omg.   Chocolate \"hit me\" cake--a better, more creative way to eat chocolate and ice cream in a long time. Get this dessert.   Service was great. Friendly and fast. Will definitely be back here again soon. Well done Catch.",

    "text": "Definitely eye-CATCHing! Honestly, the walkway into the restaurant is beautiful. A a \"bridge\" if you will with a dime of vines/leaves and two iconic places for photos-the infamous CATCH sign and the Butterfly wings.   The best way for me to describe this place is...\"busy classy\". They are normally in busier cities such as NYC and LA, which attract the popular upper class lifestyle without the super fancy elegance.   ATMOSPHERE: The large bar makes for a great waiting space in which we were ushered in to while waiting for our table to be ready for our reservation -you can start ordering from The menu with signature cocktails.  The Inner dining room away from the bar is very similar-dark wood, with accents of metal (you know, the \"garden with dark wood and metal accents\" that are everywhere), white linens, candle light, hints of florals each way. Classy and modern. However, the tables are very close together in my opinion. (Where we sat, there was one long bench along the wall with three separate dining tables for three different couples to sit at. I've done this before, but this time, there was barry enough room to get by without knocking by your partner table). Also ended up putting the large menu on the open space of the bench between myself and the lady to my right since there's no room on your table.   FOOD: The food is delicious, but be warned that it IS fancier. This means much spending more money for a smaller portion of higher quality. (We ordered Truffle Sashimi at $33 for a cold appetizer. We ordered lobster mashed potatoes, the grilled Spanish octopus, and the Branzino.  Pretty sure this was about $125+)   Things are meant to be shared and most items of ours came out one after the other (meaning as soon as it's cooked rather than all together), which I'm not very much a fan of. The table directly to my left had all their food served together, while ours came one by one. I guess you may have to request this or put similar items together?   SERVICE: The service from our waiter was delightful, but our bussers were a bit abrupt. (Loud clanks of water on our table each time & very quick to take a plate away...even when I may still be working on it). Also, because things come out \"as they're made\" it seemed like the longest wait time in between dishes-Especially when you're hungry.   Overall, it's a nice place to try out especially if you're like me and have been waiting for them to open here. I honestly was not very impressed with the decor, the space in which I was seated, or the food. (Although I really enjoyed the sauce of the truffle Sashimi and the octopus plate was delicious and tender!) the food was definitely well cooked and flavorful-but not all was something I would go back for for the taste vs. the price.",

(The doughnuts were delicious and that's why I gave this place 1 Star)  - people had to send back dirty martinis that were mixed with ginger beer  - the service was slow and the server was rude as hell.. so honestly I tipped according to that..   Overall take your money elsewhere... the only good thing about Catch is the valet is so close to get the F*** out of there.",

    "text": "The absolute worst dining experience I've ever had.  When choosing a restaurant for your birthday, you want to make sure it's something that has amazing service and has amazing food. I have always wanted to head to Catch in LA but since I am a Vegas local, this is as good as it gets.  I made a reservation for 13 of my friends and family members. I had people fly out of town just for this dinner.  We get to the restaurant and the ambience is absolutely breathtaking when you arrive (hence the one star) great spot for photos/selfies/etc.   When we are all seated, we were given 8 food menus (remember there is 13 of us) and one cocktail menu. Just one... We asked for more, and never received them.   We placed our drink orders, my mom and another guest ordered a dirty martini.  Instead they were given a vodka martini with olives and ginger beer.   Food took forever to come out and tasted all like pre packaged microwaveable food. We were never asked if we wanted to order more drinks once ours were finished.   The best (sarcastically) part of the whole evening was the absolute worst service from our waiter David H. He had the most pompous attitude and was so rude to my guests. When it came time for dessert, I thought I'd at least get a scoop of ice cream with a candle on it.  But no, David said we had to order dessert for me to get a candle.   Seriously?!?!  What establishment is this that a birthday girl can't even get a free scoop of whatever for her birthday...especially after dropping money for drinks, apps, and entrees.   I was given a guilt trip by David H that \"none of my friends ordered dessert, so here's a free cookie.\"  I was shocked by how disrespectful he was to not only me the birthday girl but to my guests.   Please do yourself a favor and stay far away from this establishment. I wish I would of listened to all the yelp reviews instead of wanting to give it a chance. My birthday evening started off pretty terrible thanks to the awful service at Catch.",

Some of our favorite dishes included:  Truffle sashimi, crispy shrimp, trio tartar, spanish Grilled octopus, and steak was perfectly cooked and a perfect medium rare!  Big servings...be sure to share!  Loved their donut wheel...so tasty!  Presentation of each dish was great...very beautiful!  We will be back...worth visiting...True 5-star!",

    "text": "Walking up to the entrance of the restaurant (in the lobby of Aria) you are smacked in the senses by a carefully-crafted silk floral social media-conscious series of photo ops that make navigating to the checkin stand somewhat of a challenge (read: annoying people in the way). The main bar is the next thing you see, and it's busy...and loud. Thankfully we were seated in another room at a fantastic table and had a very attentive and professional server who never let us want for anything.  Apps of crispy shrimp and king crab were darn good. The snapper and scallop entrees were tasty but nothing extraordinary; Brussel sprouts were fabulous. The meal was very enjoyable but I don't need to go back. If there was a negative, it would be the frequent stench of truffle from dishes that were carried by us; it is an ingredient present in a humorously high number of menu items.  We've eaten better food, of course, but the overall experience was excellent (as it should be for the high prices).",

    "text": "This was a very disappointing experience.   Our group was attending a private party located within a private room in the back of Catch. I made a reservation via Opentable ahead of time for a group of 6, knowing that we would need to grab dinner.  Stepped into party and it was rather loud and provided only appetizers. Several of us stepped out to go to our table reservation.  When I get to the host desk, they tell me they won't seat us unless our entire party is standing there (nowhere to sit, so yes, stand). I explained that they were in the back room and it didn't matter. I texted the rest of our group to come on out and within 10 minutes they stepped out. We then proceeded to wait. We were finally seated 35 minutes after our reservation time. As we were seated, 3 colleagues asked to join us and pulled up a couple of additional chairs.   I glanced at the menu and the prices were outrageous. They have a whole snapper for $90. Corn is $11. As we were reviewing the menu, staff told the only Asian in our group that there were too many people and he had to leave. Claimed it was a fire hazard. Hmm. Gaggles of people were standing a few feet away trying to enter the private party, but 2 extra chairs at our table was a fire hazard. No offer to try and accommodate us at another table  Too bad that staff picked on a the wealthiest individual in our group to leave the restaurant. Yes, we all left.   I find most restaurants in Las Vegas during CES try hard to accommodate. For the prices they are charging, I recommend they learn to provide better service or try accommodating people willing to spend the money.",

    "text": "I came here to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday - she wanted seafood and I heard it was a photogenic entrance, so why not? When you enter, the decor is gorgeous. If you get there before 7pm, it'll be easy to snap away, but after, it'll be a cluttered walkway. Upon arrival, I gave them my name and reservation time. We were asked to wait at the bar while the table was getting prepared - I think we waited about 15-20mins. While at the bar, we were ignored the entire time and a couple minutes before the hostess grabbed us, the bartender asked if we'd like to see a cocktail menu.  When we were seated, you can't help but notice how close you are to the other tables. A table for two barely fit two glasses of water, two cocktails, and two appetizers; however, our server did pace our meal and I greatly appreciate that (Thanks Darren!). Throughout the service, our waiter was present and I had no problems with the prebussing. We didn't feel rushed and they didn't try to take away plates before we were absolutely finished. We started with the lobster mac and cheese and grilled squid. The grilled squid is absolutely delicious - it was tender and not chewy - it came with potatoes and a sauce I thoroughly enjoyed. As for the lobster mac and cheese, it was unmemorable. It disproportionate amount of lobster throughout. For our entrees, we got their herb branzino and some truffle parm fries. The branzino was delicious! It was lightly sauteed and came with seasoned rice and veggies (again, the sauce was so freakin good).  As for the fries, you can never go wrong with them. At the end of the meal, we got the ONE HIT cake - the name will make sense when you get it. The bourbon sauce made it for me and I would definitely get it again. By the way, you'll probably want to record the presentation. Overall, we enjoyed the food.  TL;DR: Cute entrance, loud ambiance, signature drinks were delicious, avoid the lobster mac and cheese, and get that ONE HIT cake.",

    "text": "The outside of the restaurant is definitely pretty. Good for pictures. I went with my bf and we got a table for two. It's a very small table on a long couch area. There was a very nice couple next to us and we even made small talk (that's how close the tables are next to each other).  If you don't like the small space, maybe go with a larger party because there seemed to be more bigger isolated tables. Music is pretty loud but not club loud.  they played hip hop mostly.   Food: it's good but It wasn't  mind blowingly good. I could probably find cheaper and at par tasting/better food elsewhere. I do know it's the strip and it's just expected to be expensive. Sushi was just alright to me. Had the truffle sashimi and catch roll. It's good quality sushi, just basic. I did like the mushroom spaghetti and the hit me chocolate cake. Although most of the allure of the cake was that I got to hit it.   My boyfriend got the dorade fish. That was pretty good.   I did like the cocktails. If you're like me, and you don't like it too strong and you want it to taste good. I got the pineapple something.  Service was also just okay. The server was nice but it had a very casual, hurried vibe to it. Not a fine dining feel at all.   But yeah, if you are looking at the other reviews you can tell there's a mix of really good and really bad, and I think it's in the middle, kind of eh. Plus we spent $200 for eh, so prolly not coming back.",

At a table of two, you're sitting basically bar style right next to other couples, whereas some four tops are sat for two people...how is that fair? LOL. Then come to see that half the restaurant isn't full, and yet you STILL can't hear each other. We sat around for 10 minutes before ever seeing a waiter, and the food was sub-par. I'd say it's about 35% of Catch in LA. As frequenters of Vegas and sushi lovers, there's no reason to come back.",

I would give this place a 5 star, but I'm knocking a star off due to the unfriendly hostesses. We had to wait over 30 minutes after our reservation time without the hostesses informing us how long the wait will be. After 30 minutes wait, I asked the hostess again how far along we'll have to wait, and she said they're cleaning our table. So we decided to grab a drink at the bar and wait for the remaining time; which is another 10 mins. If we knew we had to wait over 30 minutes after our reservation time, we would've grabbed drinks from the start instead of dilly dally there and thought we'll be seated soon. The food is great, even though a bit pricy, but it's Vegas. Would I come back? I would have to say 50/50, because I don't really wanna deal with those arrogant hostesses. Plus, it's Vegas, not that hard to find good food.",

The decorated bird cages and tree in the middle of the eating area are esthetically pleasing. Lively atmosphere with a great playlist. Noise level high. A lot of people talking over the music and their neighbors. The food was delicious. The spicy grilled octopus is a must! The lobster mash wasn't what i expected. The taste, color and consistency reminded me of lobster bisque poured into mashed potatoes. I did not eat all of my red snapper because I filled up in the octopus (yummy). The wine selection is impressive. There is a Coravin wine selection! First time I've seen that on a menu. The pistachio cheese cake was ok. A little overkill on the pistachio (and I eat pistachios regularly). It is not an inexpensive dining experience; I knew that prior to making reservation. I recommend for food and wine selection. My night wasn't star worthy for a return visit.",

When we arrived we waited for a bit, even with reservation and when seated , we were at a small end table where I was sitting at the end of the bench seat which was very uncomfortable. The waitress was very unhelpful as far as recommendations, and seemed rushed. We literally there for under 20 MINUTES from drink to appetizer to dinner!!! The table next to us was very close so we didn't have much privacy. Food good, but felt like I was in a fast food restaurant. Not to mention the waitress brought our side vegetable dish when we were almost done with our entree. We sent it back. Extremely disappointing evening- that is a very short evening!!!  Would not recommend Catch until they work on their service and seating arrangements.",

We accepted the truth and quietly left. It's great if you have the right look, since they'll fill the main area with your group first. If you're not privileged or come with the wrong baggage (as we did so to speak), expect to be treated like second-class people and spoken down to loudly. Yep. No joke. No exaggeration.

The food is just eh to me. There's nothing spectacular about it (it's quite similar to the Catch in LA). Come more for the ambiance moreso than the food.",

Service: Service lacked a little, but as I said it was extremely busy and for the first weekend being open I'm sure the servers were highly stressed. They were extremely polite and knowledgeable, just took a while to get cocktails on the table.   Overall: great restaurant for a fancy date night. Loud music for a great vibe.

    "text": "I was so excited to celebrate my birthday at Catch because of the ambiance and decor.  I made my reservation back in November  for January. I went to the restaurant  a few weeks after making the  reservation and asked the hostess if I could add to my party. She confirmed the change from seven people to ten. The day of my reservation I was running 5mins late so I called to inform the restaurant and had my friend at the restaurant  check the party in. Upon arriving my friend was told there was no reservation.We then showed the  hostess the screenshot of the confirmation of the reservation and suddenly we have reservation now. The hostess states it's only for seven people. I inform her that I physically  came to restaurant more than a month prior to change that.  Suddenly some woman interjects our conversation stating something about 8 o'clock. I did not want to wait two hours for a reservation made for 6:00 p.m. Then the woman seamed frustrated and stated she can accommodate us,  but we  have to be done by 8:00 p.m . I agreed to her terms and we wait to be seated. Our waiter was friendly and provided great service. The food arrived in a timely manner. We were done with dinner within the time they allotted us. The next day I woke up with an  upset stomach and was sick as well as 4 other people  from my party that shared the sushi dishes. In conclusion my experience wasn't that  great  since they  claimed there was  no reservation  and then ended up getting sick and making my friends sick. We spent too much money for the experience we had and only to pay the price of food poisoning.",

    "text": "Catch is a great new addition to the Aria Hotel.  It is one of the more popular up and coming restaurants in the bigger cities, so the hype naturally makes it more popular in the Vegas scene.  The location of the restaurant is easily accessible through the main entrance of the Aria valet/lobby, the access through Crystals is also an easy walk across. As you walk in to the restaurant you will see a long \"hallway\" type entrance with lots of photo ops, and will bump into guests taking lots of pictures as they wait. We had dinner reservations at 7:30, but were not seated until 8-8:15. There is a bar where guests can wait, but can be a bit frustrating to wait so long if you are starving. The service after being seated was great, our waiter was knowledgeable in the menu and very nice.  We were with a party of 6, and most items came out great.  We had also ordered the rice cakes, which never showed up, but no big deal we were already full by this point. The chocolate dessert is delicious - a definite try.",

It's no secret that Las Vegas Strip dining prices can give one sticker  shock- it's double disappointing when there is not enough food to feel full after.  Not here- the prices were normal for the Strip but the portions were much more than expected - nice sized portions and beautifully plated with very  little waiting time the servers made us feel welcome and checked In Frequently enough but not over bearing.  My swordfish was the BEST I ve ever eaten.  The truffle fries out of this world with a vegan aioli !  Don\"t even think of missing the Hellfire sushi roll as an appetizer! We ate in the bar and the atmosphere was fun, social, energetic, not over crowded or loud.  This is a top stop and this local will definitely be back",

Our reservation was at 9:45 and we weren't seated until 11:15pm, only because we had to ask them twice to not forget about us while we patiently sat in the bar waiting forever. After they finally sat us down we immediately started ordering since we were starving and the 2 things on the menu that we were most excited to try, they had \"run out of\".  So we ordered some other things and we thought the food was just ok. Definitely not worth the hour and a half wait. The eating area is very crowded and loud. Our server was nice and professional but never once acknowledged our anniversary even though I stated in our reservation that's what we were celebrating. I used the restroom before we left and the stalls were out of toilet paper and both trash cans were completely over flowing. Definitely not the experience we were expecting or was hoping for and we wish we had gone somewhere else. The only thing we liked was the entry way.",

I called earlier that morning letting the host know it was for a birthday - the host did a great job asking details on the birthday girl and let us know they would bring out a dessert. When I got to the restaurant at 10:15PM I was notified that our table was not ready (we were early so that is ok) and the host again reiterated that it was for a birthday, asking the name of the guest and confirming they would do something. We came back at 10:30PM to  get seated and was told our table wasn't ready yet and we were directed into the bar. Wasn't a big deal but then it took over 15 minutes to get a drink and we didn't get seated till after 11PM - having to go back multiple times to check with the host. I believe we got seated at 11:05ish. Food was great as were the cocktails. However, we asked our server when the birthday girl was away in the restroom what we would be doing for her bday. He said Catch does not do anything. We told him of the conversations we had earlier and nothing. We stepped away and went back to the host stand and was told the same thing. Was a total disappointment and somewhat embarassing for our birthday girl. Not once did anyone notify and manager nor did anyone stop and check on in us. Our dinner was over $400 for 4 people, not counting what we spent at the bar previously.   Disappointing dinner and would not recommend due to the poor customer service.",

We asked about sake and they called over the\"Somm\". She recommended a sake we hadn't tried and it fit our taste to a tee.

We had to speak to the manager, we would have easily spent more money there however our waiter was not at our table at all. When it came time to check out, she had forgotten to charge us a bottle of wine and failed to take off an appetizer they were going to comp due to it coming out AFTER THE MEAL. We had a table at a club which we were an hour late for due to the waiter taking over 45 minutes to bring us our check after paying. All in all, no matter how good the food was or how beautiful the venue, I would not recommend spending the money for this kind of service.",
