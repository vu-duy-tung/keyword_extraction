The staff is always friendly and efficient.  The food is always amazing.  The Thai basil fried rice is a must have...but then so is the beef salad and the yellow curry.  The flat rice noodles with pork is to die for.   I am waiting for the day they open a location on the east side of town!  Till then, I will keep going back to Archi's Thai Kitchen cause I just gotta.",

    "text": "I dined here 6/20/08 and had the worst service ever!  I have actually been eatting here for the last 4 years and use to go to the original location on torrey pines and flamingo, and since they have opened the one on rainbow and 215 i have been going there instead.  I ordered lard na, and it was served to me chunky with a weird odor.  I tasted it and it was disgusting, I called the server to switch my order and explained to him and her that the noodles were either burnt or old one or the other.  I have ordered the dish in the past and it has never tasted or looked like the way they served it to me that day.    The waitress said if she takes the food back it would be a lost to the business and she would have to pay for it!  I was shocked, apalled and offended with her response.  I am not one of those customers that eats all their food and then sends it back for a free or different meal.  The plate was practically untouched and still she refused to take it back, saying it was business policy.    I asked for a manager, which she said wasn't there.  I am very fimilar with the establishment and knew that Archi himself would be at the other location working, so I had her give me the number to speak to him myself.    I explained to Archi the situation, and he too said that they never ever take food back, and that his cooks prepare meals the same way every time.  I am of south east asian descent myself, and I know exactly what the dish is suppose to look like, and last but not least I have eatten there before with out the burnt and odor smell.    It wasn't until I told him that I would put a bad review, and that I worked in the F & B industry was when he said that they make exceptions once a year.  Thats bull if you ask me.  If you are in the area try kin paow on rainbow and windmill, price is comparable and food is much better than archis.  If you disagree, the day any of  you ever dispute the food trust me you will be upset with their \"business policy!\"",

Ordered the Pad Prik King with Chicken and the Beef Salad at a 7 for both on the spice scale.  Had a nice kick to it but not over powering.  Tons of flavor in both dishes.  The thing that was most noticeable was the use of fresh ingredients in the Beef Salad.  It literally just reeked of freshness.  Would highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely be back the next time I am in Vegas!",

It was just after the super bowl so I guess this a good thing.  Anyways, the service was friendly and fast.  We had they Pineapple curry and Phad Thai.  The Phad Thai is among the best we have ever had.  The noodles were firm but not rubbery and the sauce was not too sweet or sour.   The curry was good too....a little on the soupier side but was smooth and spicy.  Maybe it's because it was made from powder rather than paste.  Their brown rice was just okay.  A little too fluffy for my liking.  All for under $20, what a great deal.  I even made it to the show with time to spare.",

We ordered everything at a hot level of \"5\" and could have probably ordered a \"3\" or \"4.\"  We asked if anyone ordered it hotter, and our waitress told us that some order it at a \"25\" or \"30.\"  I'm not sure I believe that, because it has to be impossible to survive even a \"10\" at this place.

My friend and I found all of our dishes (2 starters, 2 mains) to be over-cooked, tough, greasy but cheap. If you are visiting Vegas and staying somewhere on the strip, this is really not worth the taxi journey off it. Invest the cash for somewhere that might be a bit more pricey but worth it.",

We fly into Vegas once a year for a convention and we are always looking for a great place to eat \"off the strip\". We did Lotus of Siam last year. Archi's has a lot to live up to. Took a $20 cab ride out here. Food is good but not great. Menu is a bit sparse. Green curry was very average. The ginger beef dish was very good and so was the salad and the chicken satay sticks. We don't need a full bar in a restaurant, but they'd probably get more business if they served beer and wine. You cannot buy ANY alcohol here at all so we settled for tea and water. Had to wait forever to get a cab back to the strip. Overall, food is probably a 4 1/2. Location and decor is about a 3 1/2 . Service was very good. Overall, a good restaurant, but nothing special and for the $40 cab ride out and back, we feel the Lotus of Siam has this place beat hands down, due to closer location to strip and much more interesting menu.",

I called ahead to order our food since my coworkers and I only have an hour to grub. I specified this as soon as I called, was allowed to place my order and as soon as I repeated that I would be there at 11:40, she said \"Oh no, we can't do that. You can only order ahead if you're picking up.\" Doesn't make a lot of sense considering that regardless or whether you call it in ahead, or call it in as a pickup, you're still making the food and you're still taking the chance that the folks who ordered may not show up. We show up and request to be seated. We were told we could sit, but we weren't met with politeness AT ALL. We had to ask for water and chili THREE times and was treated horribly by one waitress in particular, so much that I felt it necessary to speak to the young manager, Chris. I explained to him that regardless of being a dine in or pick up customer, we were still a paying customer and would have left a cash tip but were treated horribly. He continued to make excuses about their policy and how they want to keep their dine in customers as dine in and the pick ups as only pick ups. Bottom line, we showed up, we paid, and we asked for service and were met with deplorable service.",

Reminds me of the Chinese place Tracy eats in 'Oh God, book 2' where she says good bye to George burns (aka God). It's swanky, peaceful and very zen.   Today I'm picking up take out for a work pot luck. Pineapple curry ( with chicken) #2 spice. Warning. #4 made me cry. But I loved every drop!! And pad Thai with shrimp, also #2!    This is a great place for a date night. Super close to the strip just Down from the palms. I've tried about 1/4 of the items and it's all to die for!  My only complaint is they aren't in Henderson!!

I didn't know there was more than one location, so that was a pleasant surprise, as I had never been to this location. My pepper steak was good, although the \"4\" wasn't as spicy as I was anticipating, so I will bump it up next time. The lunch combo comes with soup, an egg roll and a won ton. Good portion, good price and good food. One in our group ordered Sweet and Sour something and didn't get her meal until the other seven of us were almost done. The other meals just kind of filtered out to the table as they were done. It's kind of hard to eat with friends when everyone is getting their meal at different times. I am definitely a fan of Thai Thursday and will be back. A more prompt delivery of the meals and this is a four star experience.",

My other half ordered pad thai - it was huge. for dessert we had the mango mochi as one yelper suggested - it was quite yummy and was an effective means of cooling of my flaming mouth. I would come back here in a heartbeat. I wish the east coast had thai this good!!!",

    "text": "Great food. A little Americanized but great nonetheless. Noodle dishes are the absolutely best I've had, and I'm a pad thai junkie. Not too sweet, not too spicy (Unless you alter the spice rating), it is perfectly balanced. The meat dishes are perfectly seasoned as well. I haven't had a chance to try the curry, but I've seen a lot of other diners eating it and I've heard a lot of great things about it. For appetizers, the stuffed chicken wings are my favorite. I don't know how they do it, but it's two, over sized drumsticks stuffed with noodles and vegetables, fried golden brown and served with a tasty plum dipping sauce. You have to try it. Also, in my opinion, Thai cuisine has the best fried rice amongst all Asian countries. Try Archi's pineapple fried rice and tell me you don't agree.  The location on W. Flamingo is the original spot, its extremely small and accommodates about 25-30 people max. But the decor is very \"homey\" and full of great people. The service is friendly, attentive and helpful. The new location off of S. Rainbow and the 215 is a whole lot bigger, but food and service is as consistent as the original location. If you love Thai food, you have to try this place out.",

We ordered the fresh spring roll for appetizer, crab fried rice, mixed veggies with beef, and spicy basil with pork in \"medium\" spiciness. The appetizer was an interesting combination of chinese sausage, cucumber, and fish cake(?) - the taste with the sauce was interesting to say the least. It is worth a try if you don't want that fried stuff once in a while. The crab fried rice was one of the best I had, the price is very reasonable for the amount of fried rice we all had. The veggie beef was tasty and the beef wasn't too chewy IMO, and the spicy  basil pork, though was spicy, the taste was there and it was PERFECT with white rice. Yes we got white rice on top of the generous portion. Too bad that our hotel has no fridge nor microwave ....... we could not bring it back.  IF I wanna eat Thai in Vegas, we will be here again",

The window sticker suggests that this is the best Thai food in town, and leaves room to wonder whether it really is. We started with the fresh spring rolls, and ordered pineapple fried rice w/ shrimp, spicy eggplant (which they label as eggplant spicy) w/ tofu, pad pak w/ chicken, and the pad kapow w/ beef.   To start, the spring rolls were rolled with a non traditional rice sheet, and were not made with the usual ingredients. Even the peanut sauce seemed a bit lacking. The spicy eggplant had just enough grease to make it delish, and the fried rice was to die for. I barely touched the pad pak, and almost steered clear of the pad kapow - like eating mashed up beef patties. Despite the less favorable dishes, I am still craving me some Archi's!",

I also had an order of combination pad thai and penang curry.  The pad thai was the weakest of the dish.  A little on the dry side.  I ordered the curry at a 10 and it was nicely executed with decent heat, definitely not hot as I wanted.  The food is good quality but a little \"white washed\".",

    "text": "This place deserves 5 stars based on these 3 things:  1. AFFORDABLE PRICE: My parents, sister and I visited this place on a Sunday night while visiting Vegas for the weekend.  We ordered soup, pad thai, chicken larb, seafood salad, stuffed chicken wings, sticky rice, thai tea and thai iced coffee.  The total bill was $64!!!  $64 for a complete meal with soup, appetizers, sticky rice, drinks and noodles is pretty dang good!  Not only that, but the dishes weren't dinky and were plentiful!  The Thai Tea and Thai Iced Coffee also came in huge glasses. So much that my parents didn't finish their drinks and had to take it to go.  I'm used to a very fat bill with small portions every time I visit a Thai restaurant back home in California, so $64 looked great to us.  2. GREAT FOOD:  Not only was the place very affordable for a Thai Restaurant, but it was amazingly delicious.  BEST CHICKEN LAAB/LARB I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE! (From a restaurant, that is.  I still think Mom & Bro-in-law makes the best larb in the world).  It was a perfect combination of salty and sour.  I find that some restaurants make it too salty or don't add enough of that larb stuff..... rice powder/toasted rice powder.  I immediately tasted a hint of rice powder and asked my mom if she did too... just to confirm it.  They also added just enough cilantro and greens to add that fresh herb taste to it.  Everything was in perfect unison.  It was just damn PERFECT!  Everything else was great; Tom Yum Soup was flavorful, seafood salad was fresh, pad thai was also delicious and the sticky rice was heaven!  It was kept in a bamboo warmer and had that home quality taste just like the way Grandmas makes sticky rice.  We ordered a 4 spicy on a scale of 1-10 and it was just perfect.  It was pretty spicy for a 4, but it was just about right.  We got our pepper kick without totally burning off our tongues.  I come from a family that eats spicy food, so I recommend asking for 3 or lower if you can't really take the heat.    3.  GREAT SERVICE:  I was put in charge of searching for restaurants to go to during our trip, so initially, I was thinking about taking my parents to a more fancier, \"Best Thai Restaurant in the Country\" place.  But last minute, I decided on Archie's because of the reviews that stated this place was a small, family owned restaurant.  Knowing my parents' preference and my own as well, I knew we would enjoy the food and atmosphere of a small restaurant.  The 2 waitresses were super friendly and often checked back on our tables to see if we needed anything else.  They also came back around to refill our water twice.  The only negative about Archie's is that it's away from the strip.  It's not too far, but its a few miles.  Also, the restaurant is located on a very dark shopping center.   The shopping center was deserted and.... kinda creepy.",

Unlike most Thai places, when you ask for spicy they give it to you on the Thai scale rather than the 'yeah right, whitey' scale, which I've come to recognize as a mark of respect. The service was always terrible and the place is tiny, but the heavenly food makes up for these mortal flaws.  I know this constitutes blasphemy, but in terms of vegetarian Thai food I think Archi's holds its own against Lotus of Siam.",

I ordered the yellow curry and the pad ke mow and I have to say the pad key now was good but average. The yellow curry On the other hand was excellent. It was a creamy smoothness with plenty of flavor and spice with a nice  warmth after a few forks.   Portions were large so come hungry or be prepared to box some up for home.   Service was good my water glass was always full.",

The workers seem younger and less patient then their older counterparts at the fancier locations 3. They dont take directions 4. Rude  When I place an order over the phone im usually looking directly at the menu. Now the menu they have online looks like some fuzzy picture of a picture. I ordered 2 orders of pad thai, one chicken one house(with all meats). NO NUTS. Which I reiterated twice no nuts. Ok 25 min, k great.  As I arrive to pick up my order Im met with a heafty $27. Yikes. The menu says 6.95 ea. Im quickly told that was the lunch price and the dinner price was 9.95 and 12.95 for the house pad thai. Wowzers i said, I didnt see any dinner prices on the menu. Well dinner started at 3pm. Hm interesting. As i pay him he hands me the food, shuts the window then walks away.. Um wtf how did you know i didn't want my change back?  Rude.  Once i made it home i opened the containers hoping the tasty food would calm my nerves and what do i see.. Nuts.. Nuts.. Why me. I'm not allergic or anything but i did state twice I didn't want any on either order. After that initial let down my boyfriend and I check the menu again.. Im right, no dinner prices and it looks like a picture of a picture.  The food was okay but for the hassle I'm sure I can find a place with a friendlier staff and less grease.  Also know for lunch specials you will get cheated out of soup if you do take out. You will still have to pay the same price, but no soup. I even tried to negotiate an extra wonton or egg roll since there was no price difference but no deal.  As if 11/28/15 looks like the menu is up to date visually and the prices more accurate.",

It wasn't empty, there were several groups of people eating but I guess everyone was just eating verrrry quietly :)  FOOD: - pad prik king with pork (spicy level 10) - yum! And most definitely spicy! The heat doesn't really hit you until you eat more of it, but when it does woooo-eee that's good! Green beans were still crispy and the dish wasn't too oily. - pad kee mow with chicken (spicy level 10) - this wasn't as spicy as the pad prik king but still very yum! Good breather from the spiciness.  SERVICE: Decent. The servers seem a bit lackadaisical but the restaurant wasn't crowded anyways. We had to ask for water refills, and for the fish sauce & chili mix. They never brought us that little tray with the sriracha either!   An older couple came in when we were eating and they appeared to be regulars since the staff welcomed them very warmly and brought out a dish without them even ordering. So sweet to see :)  VENUE & LOCATION: Restaurant is home-y. We sat in a booth and the chairs look very cushy. Plenty of parking all around.",

While the service isn't completely catering to the customer it is still good and they will come to you once you call them over.   Cons: first of all this is totally opinionated so make your own judgement on the following statements: I was not as intrigued by the flavor combinations. I've ordered my three dishes (pad Thai spicy string beach chicken and Panang curry) at many Thai restaurants  and this restaurant has to have my least favorite in flavoring. It was very under seasoned for me personally. All I rated in the Panang curry was coconut milk whereas other places I get a more fragrant herbal smell and overpowering taste. Also the chicken was completely over cooked I had to chew on it like it was bubblegum.   As of returning, this restaurant goes on my maybe list because it is out of my way and I wasn't 80-100% satisfied",

The place itself is small, but not crowded.  It was very clean, nice decor, and nice ambiance.    We had the Thai Toast, Beef Jerky, Chicken Pad Thai, Panang Curry, and the Pad Prik Pow.    Started with the Thai Toast and Beef Jerky.  The Thai Toast has minced chicken and shrimp inside with cucumber salad on the side.  I had mistaken the cucumber salad for dipping sauce, but it was still good.  I say cucumber salad is good dipping sauce for Thai Toast.    The Beef Jerky had the perfect combination of tender and thick.  Full of flavor.    The Chicken Pad Thai came in a huge plate.  I say it's good for at least 2-3 people, depending how hungry you are.  On a spicy level from 1-10, the spicy level we ordered was a 7 and it was spicier than I expected!  I absolutely loved the flavor.    I ordered the Panang Curry with a level 5 spicy level (out of 10).  Again, also spicier than expected, which is awesome.   Last, I had the Pad Prik Pow.  This also had a spicy level 5 out of 10 and spicier than expected.  I had to order some Thai Iced Coffee to cool my taste buds.    Archi's Thai was a great experience with great food, and great ambiance.",

I am on my way home from work and decide I'm going to call in an order. So i call and order the spicy eggplant with pork (recommended by the girl on the phone) an order of Thai wontons and an iced Thai coffee. I show up in 15 minutes and wait for maybe about 5. Service is amazing. So friendly and sweet. Gosh that's hard to find in Las Vegas. She brings out my iced coffee and I'm in love. It's so yummy. I believe it's made with condensed milk which is why it's so amazing. I get my food and go home . They have put plenty of napkins and two forks. Awesome. We settle down and begin to eat. Omg the spicy eggplant is a 10! It's amazing I prefer it a spicy level of 8 and it was perfect. Just enough heat for me. I tend to love spicy food the hotter the better I was scared of 10 but I think I could try it next time. The wontons were mixed with pork and shrimp and they were decent nothing to complain about. The eggplant  stole my heart. My boyfriend also loved it all. So Archis has faithful customers with us!",

Catfish Delight -  This was ok, it was a little on the saucy side, but I still finished the entree pretty much all by myself.  Panang Curry w/ Beef - BEST I have EVER tasted.  It was so good!

So taking her advice we tried this place out.  Since then, we try to hit up this place whenever we are in town.  I swear this place is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo  yummy!  :) :)  Their yellow curry is exceptionally good and very flavorful. I highly recommend it.  We typically order their Pad Thai and Pad See Ewe and Satay as these are our favorite Thai dishes.  Archi's does a great job with them all.  Everything we have tried thus far has been awesome.   We look forward to eating at this place whenever we come to Vegas.",

I go to Archi's Thai Kitchen more often than the other 2 because this location has a 'drive-thru' and that's awesome. I'm in and out of the house all day, everyday, and it's great that I can call this place up and they have my order waiting for me at the drive-thru 15-20 mins later. Very practical. For the most part, the people have been polite and friendly at this location. I definitely have no complaints when it comes to the food. Always delicious. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "I wish they would open up one of these in San Diego- WOW, it was soooo good.  Had to deliver some of my art to a collector in Vegas, and we picked Archi's for dinner, as the other place we read about out near it was closed (ended up being a lunch only place) But I'm glad it was, this place was such a find. Read about it from Yelp on the iPhone while searching for something else nearby.  And at first we were a bit hesitant, the name didn't sound all that Thai, but it went well with the modern/clean decor, which made the atmosphere very nice. It's much nicer than your standard Thai restaurant for sure, and the staff was very friendly, every one of them.   The food was spectacular, very fresh and came out quickly. Appetizers; spring rolls and stuffed chicken wings, and it went uphill from there. I liked they asked what level of spice you wanted (1-10), but I just asked for 5 and asked for the spice so I could add to my liking, and they brought out a whole array of them, so I added different ones at will.   All dishes were superb, for the wife and myself both (we split the dinners, Chinese style as usual), and I can't wait to go back and deliver the next batch of art there, just so we eat here. It was about 15 minutes from downtown, as we stayed near the airport. (VEry clean Hampton Inn for only $44 a night by the way, w/ breakfast!).",

Was introduced to Archi's by some friends and come back to eat every time I visit Vegas.  They marry the perfect spiciness to sweet in their Pad Thai.  Not overly greasy, very fresh and authentic along with good service.    I used to work up the street so came for lunches about once a week.  Had a nostalgic food moment, so I had to write about it.    Chicken Pad Thai (get it SPICY!!) - Winner.  Good Thai Ice Tea as well.    Reasonably priced.  I believe they have a fullbar, so you can get your drink on if you'd like.",

    "text": "I am convinced that Archi's has influenced a lot of Thai restaurants in town.  In my opinion, this old restaurant has set the standard for Thai restaurants that stay moderately authentic, while at the same time appeal to the general public.  In my opinion, Archi's is a solid Thai restaurant, but it lacks the uniqueness and higher level of authentic Thai that I look for in a Thai restaurant.    My Thai friend who is a cook told me that Archi's has good stir fries, but forget about the curries.  So, I thought I would try both.  We ordered the Thai tea, which was excellently balanced with sweetness and cream, the pad cha cha cha, the panang with chicken, and tom kha with chicken.  Let's start with my favorite dish, the tom kha!  I loved the tom kha (khi)!  It has nice whole shrooms, with basil and a fairly good amount of lime juice, along with other yummy herbs.  The coconut milk was generous, and very creamy.  I think it could have been made a little more sour, since I prefer my khi's to be puckeringly sour!  However, underneath Thai Grill, this has to be one of the best tom kha's I have had.    Next up is the pad cha cha cha, which is a mixed seafood stir fry dish with a lightly spicy teriyaki sauce, and bamboo shoots.  The teriyaki sauce itself was a little bit on the generic side, but tasty enough to enjoy.  What did wow me though was the freshness of the squid.  It was nice and soft, not chewy at all!    The panang, which I have heard was good from different people (and not so good from my Thai cook friend), was in my opinion an excellent version of the standard panang you'll get at any Thai restaurant.  It also reminded me of the chu che salmon at Thai Style Noodle House, but with a little less character.  Overall, it was tasty, but not overly unique.  I still think Thai Grill has the most unique curry flavors to date.  However, compared to other Thai restaurants, this version of the dish has a nice balance between sweetness, coconut milk, and herbs.    I struggled between three and four stars with this review.  However, Archi's has long been the favorite for a few Thai people I know, but today there are a few better restaurants out there.  For the sake of their history though, and their ability to help make Thai food popular in Las Vegas, I am settling on a four star rating today due to the previously mentioned facts, and that awesome tom kha!",

I do like pin kaow better overall but this place is still well worth eating.  The lunch special is fantastic and I had it with red curry and it was great..  The tom kha gai soup here is awesome and probably better than kaow.   The reason I like pin kaow a little better is there pad thai is probably the best I have had and pad thai is one of my favorite things in the world so there you go.  I would bet that half the dishes are better at one place and the other half is better at the other.",

Though the years have passed since Archi's opened, the quality and service you get have always remained constant. The prices have increased about $2 dollars over the years, but I will still remain a loyal Archi's customer. The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because they are closed Mondays, and I can't get my Thai tea.   PS: They have the best thai tea in town.",

Why yes I do!  Speaking of spice, they spice cart had a nice assortment of pickled Thai peppers, not the jalapenos you see at the other places. Nice touch, Also had an interesting sauce that I think she said was fish sauce and garlic with pepper flakes. Whatever it was, it was good. I've only eaten there once and will definitely go back to try other dishes but from visit number 1, the food, the service and overall charm of the place, I highly recommend it!",

It's hard to fake freshness with this dish and corner cutting on the prep is obvious.  In addition to my standard test dish we also ordered fish cakes, chicken larb and sticky rice. We went for #4 in spiciness.  The food came out promptly. The papaya salad was quite fresh, peppered with dried shrimp and green beans. The taste was akin to that of the Bangkok street stalls. The fish cakes were also quite good and contained bits of either onion or leek. You could tell the slightly gritty ground rice in the larb was homemade instead of rice powder out of a jar.  The heat scale was the real deal and 4 was perfect.  It's good to know I now have yet another great Asian food option in the City of Sin.",

Their lunch special is from 11am-3pm (3pm, i think?) and it comes with salad, soup, and an eggroll + your chosen dish for about $7.00.  Whatever you order, from the curry to pad thai to papaya salad, the server  will ask you \"How spicy?\" The scale is from #1-10. I like medium spicy, so i usually ask for spicy level # 6. If I feel like I want medium spicy that leans towards hot, I'll ask for level #7.   Since this place has 3 chains all located in different parts of the town, it makes it very convenient to get your Thai food fix wherever you are. The ambiance of this place is very soft, clean, and inviting. I love dinning here. I always feel like I am at a resort. You know what i mean when you check this place out.  Side note-- If you have a big party, I suggest you go to Archi's Thai Cafe (located on W Sahara Ave). Its a bit more open and spacious. Archi's Thai Kitchen is a bit small and on the cozier side.",

The service was pretty quick, my girlfriend and I were seated in a booth right away and we took advantage of the lunch specials.    Each of our lunch specials came with soup (cucumber soup?) which I downed quickly and a salad.  I ordered a beef and curry dish while my girlfriend chowed down on her pad thai.   I liked this place's pad thai better than Lotus of Siam's however I still crave Lotus' beef penang..mmm.  The Thai Iced tea served here was well made here too.",

    "text": "After remembering coming to Archi's and having a delicious meal, I convinced some of my friends to trek across town for some Thai dinner. However, after eating here, I wonder if I was struck with early memory loss because our meal was varying in degrees of deliciousness.  Hitting nearly dinner time, the place wasn't too busy, so we were seated immediately. The waitstaff were very attentive in refilling our drinks and answering miscellaneous questions. One of my friends ordered the Yellow Curry (heat level at 3/4) while the other ordered Pad Prik King (heat level at 0 - she's a big wuss when it comes to heat). I decided to get my favorite, Pad Thai (heat level around 5).  All of our dishes came out on a timely basis, but some were let downs. My friend's curry lacked much of its heat and also much of its flavor. Literally, the Pad Prik King had more spice than his curry - sad considering what they requested heat wise. He ate a majority of it, but set foot to devouring our dishes instead. The Pad Prik King and Pad Thai were good, but nothing extraordinarily spectacular. Our mounting hunger after watching two movies resulted in both the noodle dishes' demise, but all three of us agreed that we've had better elsewhere.  Ultimately, Archi's is not what I remembered it to be years ago. Prior to my first visit two years ago, I kept hearing so many accolades for this place, but after this recent visit, I'm not sure if it's well-deserved.",

They cut the potatoes for their yellow curry a lil differently than I was expecting, but the taste and presentation of all the food is amazing. I highly recommend this place. The ONLY reason I felt inclined to give 4/5 stars is that while the wait staff was sometimes really attentive they were also somewhat very slow. Ended up waiting for quite a while for take out boxes and a check. I think one of the young gentlemen was actually very new so that's really understandable. Hoping everyone can be just a tad bit quicker and there seemed to be some preferential treatment between staff and other patrons I was seated near. But not a big deal. They were a larger party. Other than that my experience was amazing.",

The paint looked old, and there were some patches on the wall. Overall, the restaurant looked clean and it was a little busy when we were seated.  Their food didn't really blow me out of the water. I have had better Thai food in Vegas -- the food here is just average. I had the yellow curry, which comes with jasmine rice and your choice of meat (I chose beef). They asked me for the spiciness on a scale of 1-10 and their 4 was just right; not too hot, but just enough spiciness to be flavorful. It was a filling meal, but there are probably better places out there with the same price range as Archi's. When it came to dessert, they had mochi ice cream on the menu. Unfortunately, the waiter told us that they didn't even serve it anymore (menu update?).   I'd probably come back because it's in close proximity to where I live, but I wouldn't say it's as amazing as all the hype it seems to have.",

If your answer is \"yes\", than you know how I am feeling about the Archie's Thai Kitchen and Bistro. I've been going to these Archie locations for over 10 years.   LIke most relationships, it was a good start. Good quality food, and good service, and a fair vaue for Las Vegas.  A place that I could always count on for good Thai food, take visitors, and suggest to others.   Now, the story is slow service with a poor attitude, reduced portions, not properly prepared, and sometimes served cold; and unexpected charges on the bill, for minor entree modifications. No longer the reason you want to dine out.   Just like waking up to a significant other who has \"bad breath\", finding dirty underwear on the floor, or going into the bathroom, and finding it in a \"need for Lysol cleaner\" condition, my experiences at Archie's tell me it's time to move on.  So, why have I not moved on?  \"Fear of the unknown\".  After watching \"Dirty Dinning\" on the local news cast, I have concluded that there is a good chance I may pick a Thai place that has, or will be suspended by the Health Department, or is in a neighborhood that you can't find a cat on the street.   But as a wise person once said, \"Better to be misrable by yourself, than be misrable with someone else\".    It's time for me to \"break up\" with Archie's and take my chances in the world of Thai Food.",

    "text": "I was not impressed with this Thai restaurant. The ambience was missing, and the service was severely lacking. My friend and I decided to give it a try after hearing many good reviews, and it was a mistake. We came there at lunch time and had to wait to get seated. The place was extremely small and dirty. There were many pieces of food thrown about on the floor and the odor was not very pleasant. Eventually, when we got seated, the waitress was rude; she threw the menus down on the table and did not provide any pleasantries.   Our food was average at best. The spice levels were completely wrong. I like my Thai soups at 3 at most, and it came out at 6. Upon asking the server to amend this mistake, we were met with attitude and frowns, even though I was very polite about my request. The food was okay, but I didn't feel that it was fresh tasting. In fact, the rice was rather dry and traditional Thai drinks were tasteless.  I didn't really like anything about this place. Maybe, I'll give it another try at its other location, but I am never coming back to this one.",

I had the yellow curry, my usual Thai order. My husband had red curry (whatever it's called at Archie's). We were kinda disappointed! My yellow curry was very bland. It didn't taste like anything. I tasted the actual flavor of the chicken, which without seasoning, doesn't taste that great, let me tell you. I added salt to it at home, which did not help. My husband didn't like his curry either.  We really wanted to like Archie's, since it's cheaper than our usual go-to take out place (Jasmine Thai on Buffalo Rd). But we decided we'd rather pay a little more for better curry at Jasmine Thai. Maybe we just ordered on an off night, but it wasn't great.",

My cousin and her husband who practically eat anywhere and anything at anytime they want because they can afford it told me this is one of their favorite restaurants. And after trying it out for myself I can definitely agree! Let me start with the interior, this location is sort of has an odd stand alone building in the middle of a parking lot for a shopping center. But the inside is really nice because it's like your Aunt's classic living room, which has a nice home feel to it. I ordered the Pad Thai, which was in the lunch specials part of the menu. Let me just say the best Pad Thai I've ever had! Amazing flavor! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it! Service was good too and always good to know since Asian restaurants can be really rude sometimes. I recommend this place to everyone and I have been ever since I've tried them. 5 stars well deserved!!",

    "text": "Wifee says ' I want Thai '. Ever obedient, I grab the iPad, load the Yelp app and search for Thai. Archi's rates highly, but there's three Archi's I note. Eeny,Meeny,Miny,Mo. Archi's Thai Kitchen it is. Jump in the car with wifee, teen daughter & fussy eating 10 year old.  It's easy to find and great parking. Two cop cars outside, I park right by them thinking they were watching the neighborhood and the car will be safe. No cops in the car! Hum?  Go into Archi's and law enforcement were chilling at a table and seemed to be enjoying a plate of Thai food. The restaurant is bright, not large and reminds me of where you would eat your breakfast in a Hoilday Inn Express. I don't think that's a bad thing but it was very bright. Friendly server sits us immediately and gives us iced water. I order beer & Chardonnay as is my tradition. WHAT? NO BEER OR WINE? I sob..... It's clearly marked on the Yelp review but I didn't notice. Dumb. Anyway the food; we order Sesame Toast and egg rolls to start. The toast is deep fried and too greasy, egg rolls were fine. 10 year old McDonalds aficionado wants plain chicken , they fry him up plain chicken and it was great. Teen wants chicken fried rice and a Mongolian beef dish, ordered 3/10 on the heat/spice scale she thoroughly enjoyed it. Wifee ordered the same, but being a spicy food bigshot, she went for 7/10. Good choice, wifee happy. I take a chicken cashew dish , 5/10 (pathetic , I know ) and was equally happy. There were many Thai clientele eating and the place was charming. Great food, $70 before tip and we will be back to Archi's but I believe the other locations will give me a beer to quench my thirst and alleviate the heat should I go crazy and order my food 6/10 on the spice meter.",

When they ask you how hot you want it on a scale of 1-10, try going lower than usual because I think they eye ball the spiceyness-touch.  Either that or the cooks have no taste bud because they are hardcore smokers..  If you don't know where to start try their Panang Curry, Tom Kha (coconut soup), or Pad Kapow.   Their sister's property on Rainbow is just as consistent as the Flamingo one (original location) just bigger and newer looking.  They have a third property on Sahara that I haven't been to but I can guarantee it'll be just as good..   No refill on Thai tea ;/",

If you are looking for some real authentic Thai food, don't go to the fancy Thai restaurants on the strip and pay more when you can get the real thing for a fair price on Flamingo(and newer location on Sahara).   I usually order the Tom yum soup, papaya salad, and pad seew with chicken at every Thai place I try. All very yummy at Archie's.  There are spice levels from 1-10. 1 being mild and 10 being the most spicy. I ordered all 6 on the spicy dishes. I love spicy food, meaning I love jalapenos, habanero, Thai chili peppers. 6 was a little too spicy for me, but after a few bites, I got used to it. I think 5 would be perfect. At least you can add more of your own peppers to taste. I can't even imagine how spicy a 10 would be. I can imagine level 10 being on \"man vs food\".  The Thai iced tea was good, served in a huge glass. They do put tons of ice, so if you would like more liquid then ice, I'd tell them to lay off the ice a little. I personally like it with a lot of ice though. The thai iced tea also neutralizes the spicy hotness in your mouth.    The only negative comment I have about archi's is the bathroom. It's not very clean and there were no paper towels or extra toilet paper.  Go here for real delicious Thai.",

Thai tea is highly recommended since they did not make it very sweet and it was a huge glass. Most of people at our table togo half of the glass.  I did not like how the waitress kept forgetting how many people at our table and we always missed something.  This place is tiny so I would not recommend it for big group on Sat or Sunday.",

As with all the Archi's locations I stick with tofu, pork, beef and vegetable most of the time. The chicken always tends to be a little dry and overcooked. Just my personal opinion.

Short of having spectacular food, that's about as much as you can ask for in a Thai restaurant.    All of their locations are pleasantly decorated, but the Village Square branch is bigger and more modern in its setting.  I find Thai restaurants to have generally pleasant service overall, but I think Archi's goes even a step beyond that.  Their food is at least good, with some great dishes.  I'm partial to the Thai Toast, a must have appetizer in my book.  It's a flavorful meat \"stuffed\" onto toast slices, served with cucumber & onion salad.  LOVE this dish.  Their papaya salad and beef salad are also very good.  For main dishes, I like all their curry dishes and the spicy basil dish, and you can't go wrong with their pad thai.  Unless you find that spectacular Thai place, this is the place where you will not be disappointed and can find some great surprises.  There's a reason why this chain is so popular and continues to expand.  Table-for-1 Factor:  I went to lunch at the Flamingo location and there were several people eating alone.  So it's at least good for lunch, and I think it will be okay for dinner as well.  Atmosphere isn't intimidating so I don't think it will feel too awkward.",

When I arrived to pick up my food, not a single Asian in sight in the restaurant, except for the workers there of course!  I was a bit worried about that, but as I took my first bite of the Thai Beef Salad, I was pretty impressed with the flavors!  It was sweet, savory, and a hint of spice.  Pretty much the type of flavor expected in a Thai style salad.  What I was disappointed in was their Phad Thai!  Now EVERYONE has said their Phad Thai was the best, well I must say, i have had better!  The rice noodles were cooked well, but the type of ingredients used wasn't as tasteful, kind of reminded me of Chinese Sa Tay sauce on rice noodles, which was not what I was expecting.    I asked my friend who's family is from Thailand about her experience there and she basically said, \"It's good, if you like Americanized Thai Food.\"  I responded, well sometimes I do crave it but I prefer the traditional Authentic That food I can get closer to home.    I mean come on, what kind of Authentic Thai food serves an egg roll and crispy won ton skin with their Phad Thai?  How unoriginal and American is that!?    Although I did rate this place a 3-Star, I'd still come back here for their yummy Thai Beef Salad!  Yum!",

Best part is that they're vegan friendly and willing to omit the fish sauce/shrimp paste.  Another special thing about this place is that they offer whole, fresh coconut to drink and eat! Now that's hard to find. It was delicious, but REALLY filled me up. A coconut with all its water and meat can be a meal in itself. I suggest sharing it with another person if you're getting it for dessert.",

We waited for my Panang and after 20 minutes, no panang . When we asked, the waitress said, you folks only ordered pineapple fried rice, medium hot. WTF! No wonder we were spiced with chili in the pineapple fried rice and my wife wasn't happy at all. I m writing this from the restaurant. It's alright ..... Mai pen rai attitude...gave us the bill..

My man and I were searching for a different place to go and decided on Archi's since we were not far away. Not sure how they did it, but these folks nailed the \"cozy living room.\" Most tables are part booth, part chair, but all of them are comfortable and the lighting really adds to this resto's intimacy. Determined not to get our Thai standards, we opted for the silver noodles salad (sans chicken) -- which was an absolute stand-out, and the curry fried rice with crab meat (salivation central!!) Not so great were the seafood omelet (though the sauce that came w/ was delish!) and the eggplant with shrimp dish (while everything was properly cooked, the dish was super-duper bland -- my man and I were brainstorming things to add to spice this bad boy up!) Will I come back again? Absolutely!! Love this resto's ambiance and that they're mixing it up by offering folks more menu options than what the average thai place offers. Service is fantastic, with folks constantly checking up to make sure you're enjoying your meal.  Final plus: they stick to their guns on the spice level factor.  If you order a 5 of 10 on the spicy scale, expect to get exactly that!",

I usually enjoy the Pai Tai and ordered again today. Today the taste was off - way off. This gave me the feeling that I was getting yesterday's left overs warmed up.  The taste was bland, like really bland.  Usually they have some very enjoyable tastes. New chef?? Hungover chef? Help me here - I've always had a good meal until today.  Our soup was tasty as always.  My biggest complaint here is that most times they bring everything at near the same time; spring roll, soup, and entree. I really would like to space it out a bit especially when the restaurant is not busy.  Not sure when I will return. The last visit left a bad tast in my mouth - literally.  I think time to find another TAI place or go again after they have been open awhile.",

For a good four years we would eat here at a constant rate because they served great portions for inviting the whole family. We'd order 5 dishes, easy.   Well now, it's like the recession for Archie's  So disappointed in this place. They have switched up their to-go boxes for much smaller boxes (over 1/2 size reduction of the original boxes) but haven't reduced the price!   Then a couple months ago, I saw that the Fort Apache location was on \"DIRTY DINING.\" This explained my friend's and my severe uncontrollable lava experience nearly ten minutes after we paid the bill. I vowed never to eat at that location again.   This has been a long time coming, and this does come with a heavy heart. Boycotting Archie's. Komol (sp?) Is worth the drive now.",

It still being here, after all those years, really makes a statement (and it's understandable that it's loved by other Yelp reviewers).   This is bigger than a hole in a wall, so I will call this cozy (kind of reminded me of a relative's living room). Hubby thought it was tiny. So, anyway, for a weeknight it was pretty steady, looked like there were a couple empty tables. Also, had takeout business too. No place for waiting customers except to stand there. The entrance door is pretty much the middle of the restaurant, which is also where the counter is situated. Hubby said that there was more seating out of view, near the bathrooms. Music was playing but it wasn't loud, you could still hold a conversation.    We've been to another location (W. Sahara- elegant ambiance, almost feels like you're at a resort) and love the food. I thought the quality of the food was equally very good and yummy-tasting. We had a chicken curry dish (the potatoes were tender, the curry had a good flavor), fried rice (cooked perfectly), and dessert (mmm, this was a treat, not a weeknight sort of thing). We were celebrating later than usual for dinner, on a weeknight. This would be our new side of town. So, yes, we will be back soon. I think I have a takeout menu.     Service was very good. The server was nice and attentive. Very clean.",

The staff are forthcoming and welcoming. As someone who lives for spicy food (I usually order 9-10) sometimes I want more, and they give this pounded chilli which does just the trick and I'm glad they have it here. As for the food, one of the more authentic places you will find in Las Vegas. Great quality, fresh and not greasy as you would find at other restaurants. Price point: outstanding for the quality. My partner said he changed his mind about Thai food after coming here so that should speak volumes. Would recommend the basil meat dish, pad woon sen and mango sticky rice. Definitely looking forward to coming down here to try the rest of the menu. Keep it up!",

When we were half way through our meal, the egg rolls landed on our table, but this time they were to greasy and uneatable.  Absolutely no warmth or personality in the restaurant.  Not enough help.  Tables dirty, people waiting forever to get seated and get their meal.  There were tons of open tables.  Just a really bad experience and we won't be going back.

I had ordered the shrimp coconut curry soup with rice, for myself,  my favorite but when I got home There was only four shrimp's in the soup.  This dish usually lasts me two meals. I was disappointed that there was only two shrimp per serving for the two days, I was sick while eating this special soup that helps me feel better.I went to place a new order for my family and was in your drive up window your flamingo location and told them what had happened to this dish and the first two young man said not a problem we will give you three extra shrimp because I said either you could give me a discount off my order but they offered three extra shrimp. I said fine. Then another guy came to the window and started accusing me of lying insisting that the cook always puts seven shrimp in the soup.  He said I should've come back and show them that there was only 4 shrimp. I told him I've been sick and are you accusing me of lying he was insistent they would not give me the three extra shrimp so I canceled my $50 order of food for my family that night and drove away.  This guys name was and I apologize if I get it incorrect  BD? I am very upset with how I was treated. I understand people can be dishonest but I've never put in a complaint before or have a history of this other than what I had just said and for this man to treat me this way is not the right way to do business I hope you can make this right with me and my family. I have left an email to owner but they don't care. Terrible customer service to people! Plus on another occasion the noodles in a dish cause chest pains which they apologize and make good on cause the cook put the wrong ones in.",

    "text": "I'm really not going to delve into the authenticity of this place with my review. I'm not Thai, I don't know how to cook Thai food.. I'm really no expert. That being said...  We went for lunch today and I was blown away by the food. We were the only patrons when we arrived at 11:20. By the time we left at noon, it was packed. Arrive early my friends!   Lunch specials are a reasonable $6.95. I've never seen a Thai place with lunch specials, but clearly I've lived a sheltered existence.   Chicken pad thai - I guess they make it the \"Americanized\" way, but I don't care.. it was so damn tasty. The portion is quite large for a lunch portion (approx 2 cups?). I couldn't finish half of it. I almost made myself sick trying to eat it all.. yup, I'm a fatty.  Beef with bell peppers - a much more modestly (read: appropriate!) sized entree. The beef was very high quality for an asian stir fry type beef and the bell peppers were tasty as well. While there's nothing special about this dish, it was of high quality and it seemed to be relatively low calorie if you're eating light. Served with white rice.  All lunch specials were served with a wonton (seemed to have meat in it? yumm), egg roll (just ok!), and soup of the day. The soup today was chicken coconut soup. I think the lady called it that because I'm not asian, because it tasted like Tom Kha Gai to me! A mini cup of Tom Kha Gai to wash down my pad thai with? I'm in heaven.   Service was fast, and like I said many times.. the food and ingredients were all top knotch. A pleasant surprise for $6.95 each! I'll definitely be hitting this place again.",

The other two locations are much bigger and more comfortable but something about the food is just not as good.   I love getting the Tom Kha soup and mint chicken! Im getting really hungry just typing about it! The lack of 5 stars is due to the inconsistent spicy rating system. Some times I order a spicy #5 and its fairly bland and other times it burns a hole in my esophagus.

I like that their lunch options come with sides. I remember the soup being pretty good, and the spring rolls being pretty generic. Nothing to write home about.   Has anyone tried the '10' level spiciness on their entree? I'm always scared to get it, thinking that once they see the ticket in the kitchen they're going to think I'm some sort of badass and scoop 2 more spoonfuls of chili into my pad thai, so I get the 9 and it's pleasantly spicy for me.",

The portions were of a decent size, but they were a little too liberal with the onion.  The whole dish was basically covered in onion.  It's like they chopped up an entire onion and put it on my food.  I didn't mind because I'm fine with onions, but for most people it might be a little much.    The wait staff was very friendly.  I'm not a very bossy person so they don't really have to do much for me.    Overall, a decent meal, decent portions, at a good price.",

It's been years since I've eaten here! One thing that I love about this place is that you get a gigantic glass of thai tea with just the right amount of ice and mixture of tea and cream.  Most other places will give you a regular sized glass and fill it up with ice and it's finished before your food even comes.  This gigantic glass lasts throughout the whole meal and then some!  We ordered chicken larb (medium spicy) with a side of sticky rice, papaya salad, chicken pad thai, and chicken pad see ew. The entrees came with steamed rice and we didn't have to order it separately. The food altogether was yum. They had asked how spicy we wanted the larb, but they didn't ask for the papaya salad.  I feel like they made the papaya salad medium and the larb mild when I had wanted the larb to be medium.  The larb was ok, although I've had better larb at other Thai restaurants.    I love the homey feel of this restaurant.  The way that it is set up makes you feel like you are sitting at home enjoying a home cooked meal.  The overall service was excellent and they even packed up our food at the end. The pricing was reasonable as well.  For our meal, including 3 thai teas and 1 thai iced coffee, the total came out to $75.",

The Pad Thai was ok.  I wasn't blown away from it and wasn't left wanting more.  I asked the server to fry the Tofu crisp and it came out soft.  They should have fried it a little bit longer.  The spice level was appropriate and enjoyable.  I felt the same way about the Fried Rice.  It was just ok.  Atmosphere - The restaurant is small and the tables kind of feel on top of each other.  We prefer a more private dining experience.  We had a party of 6 people and that is probably the most I'd try to take here.  There is enough room to get larger groups in there, but it wouldn't feel comfortable in my opinion.  Service - The service was good.  The servers were friendly.  Will I return?  Probably not.....unless I'm invited there by a friend or family member.",

Our entrees were ordered at a spicy level 7 which had spice but wasn't overly spicy.brhe restaurant was small and quiet and we had a 2 yr old toddler so next time we will be ordering take out unless it's a date night!

    "text": "Haven't tried Las Vegas's Thai selection, so I thought, TODAY IS THE DAY! I've been recommended two places, Pin Kaow and Archi's. Since Archi's was closer to me I decided to go with that.    The restaurant itself looked like a house that was remodeled into a restaurant. Cute and cozy. Looks like a nice place to have a lunch with some friends. I ordered the Pad Kee Mow and the Yellow Curry. I'm just going to assume that curries are already pre-made for the entire day and when ordered, they just heat it up for it to be ready to serve. And Pad Kee Mow's doesn't seem too difficult to whip up either. So why the long wait? I try to play in all possible reasons for the wait before I critique. Lots of people? Nope. Short staffed compared to the number of customers? Nope. I'm patient for the most part, especially if the food makes up for all of it! But sadly, it didn't.   The Yellow Curry was a little watered down to what I'm used to. The flavor was just not strong enough for me. I wouldn't say it was totally bland but, the curry itself was just not hitting those taste buds like I wanted it to. The Pad Kee Mow was..okay. I wished there was a stronger basil flavor and more noodles. You could tell all the vegetables that came with the dish were canned. Just didn't give off the high quality thai cuisine I had hoped for.   Better luck next time? I hope so!",

    "text": "TERRIBLE FOOD!! They claim to serve \"100% authentic thai\" (but anyone who's actually HAD authentic thai) knows there's a BIG difference between those that put pride into their food vs places like these   1) The plates they gave us were filthy. 2) The egg rolls were cold. 3) They don't have coconut milk for thai tea, yet they have it for soup??? Ridiculous lol. 4) The tom kha soup was 99% lemon grass/coconut milk with zero flavor or spice, (& anyone who has had LOTS of tom kha knows that if a THAI chef can't get tom kha right then the rest of the menu is also bound to SUCK). But guess what? I never said a word about my bleh soup, my cold eggrolls, the thai tea OR the dirty plates.. UNTIL my bf complained about his garlic pepper chicken. We eat at countless restaurants all over the US, & this is the SECOND time I've ever seen him complain about his food. He will usually just leave it & not say a word, so I knew if he complained it was BAD. I don't eat meat, (but I did for 26 years) & trust me it did not look or smell appetizing. And when he brought it to the server's attention? She apologized but didn't offer to take it off the bill. Hmmm, probably because their either super greedy & don't give a F---- about their customers satisfaction, OR because they get a TON of complaints like this & can't afford to lose any more money. LOL She just said, \"oh have you gotten this here before? Cause this is our recipe\" to which I replied \"so old, leftover rubbery chicken is your special recipe? You should have taken it off the bill cause you know he couldn't eat it!!\"   It amazes me how server's can actually expect someone to pay for something that they didn't even EAT! I could not cheat my customers like that & let them leave dissatisfied. I advise anyone who appreciates quality food & service to avoid this place at all costs.",

    "text": "I've been a long time patron of Archi's Thai Kitchen but my experience this last time wasn't the best one. I recently moved back to Las Vegas and decided to make Archi's Thai Kitchen my first meal back in town after a long day of moving. After settling into my new place, I called and placed an order for stuffed chicken wings, papaya salad (som tam) and a spicy basil. The person who took my order said it would be about 25 minutes for my order to be ready so went to pick up my order just in time. When I pulled up to the drive thru window, no one came up to the window. I don't know if they have a sensor that alerts them of a car pulling up to their pick up window but that evening I waited to the window for about 10 minutes. An Archi's staff member saw me but went about his work without acknowledging that I was there waiting so I pulled around the building and parked my car in a parking spot and proceeded into the restaurant. The staff member that saw me at the window was at the front counter and I asked him if the drive thru window was out of service and he said \"no\". I asked him why I wasn't helped and he said he thought someone else was helping me. So clearly there is a communication problem among the staff or someone doesn't know how to do their job. He offered me a Thai Iced Tea on the house which I declined since I don't drink sweet drinks. After waiting for another 10 minutes my order came out and I took it home. The papaya salad and spicy basil tasted fine (these two dishes were ready when I got there) but the stuffed wings which came out last had a strange taste to it. Strangely enough the staff member who checked on my order went to the back and said the stuffed wings weren't ready but it had already been 35-40 minutes. I don't want to say it's because I gave them a hard time about me waiting at the drive thru window but the chicken tasted like they cooked it in mop water. It had a smell of old wet rag. My wife and I couldn't eat it so we threw it away. I haven't returned since this experience but I just hope they're not playing around with the customer's food. I've stayed in Thailand for almost 4 months so I know that the people there take their food seriously and don't mess around with customer's food but Archi's Thai Kitchen is in the US so I'm a bit skeptical about going back. I was contemplating on either giving them a 2 or 3 star rating but gave them 3 stars since two out of the three dishes were edible. Just a warning don't piss off their staff, you might get mop water chicken.",

It's just the right amount of heat with the perfect coconut milk wash. The Thai eggrolls always come out super crunchy and their house dipping sauce is really tasty.  A little mango and sticky rice always finishes the meal with a sweet flavoring finale. I highly recommend any Archi's in the valley, especially this one, on nights you don't feel like being presentable.",

The ambiance of the restaurant is very nice and it seems pretty clean so that made me excited for our decision.      We were one of the only customers inside so we were seated quickly.  We also had a few different servers touch our table so it was a little confusing but we managed to get everything ordered in a timely fashion.   A star was lost for service though when it got busier and we spent a good 15 min trying to flash a server down.  We wanted dessert but didn't get it because we were waiting and then we ended up walking up to the register to pay because we had been waiting so long for the check and didn't want to wait any longer.   The food was good but not spectacular.   I'd say it was average good Vegas Thai food.   I've had worse and I've had better.   I will say that the spice level was on point here.   I get a 3 with papaya salad and a 5 to 7 with everything else and most places it all tastes the same no matter what number you give.   Overall,  I would come here again to taste more items given that the sizes were good and they know how to spice it up.",

She got some coconut broth based soup with shrimp and mushrooms and I got Pad Thai like I normally do. She got a 10 spice level and I got a 7. Neither being spicy. The food was good. They gave me extra peanuts like I asked for. Again, didn't taste anything different than other places. Make your level 10 spicier! Food (3/5)  Service was confusing I had multiple servers. A server took our drink menu away from us when my friend wanted to order a beer. The server had no clue what alcohol was on their own menu. Not a lot of personality going on there. Had a couple of times where we couldn't find a server at all and it was dead there. Had to get up to ask for the drink menu. Also had to stand up to get change because  no one was around. You shouldn't have to get up for anything during your dining experience, but twice?!?! Service (2/5)  Would I come back? Doubtful with all the other similar / closer places to me. Still worth a shot might get a good experience too.",

Well they took it back to the kitchen to add cocoNut milk and it was still too strong so they changed it to pineapple rice. No extra charge and they were so nice about it. Try the pineapple rice. Yum!!",

Pineapple fried rice is chock full of goodies such as raisins, cashews, pineapple, and I prefer shrimp for the meat addition.  I've tried chicken satay at other thai restaurants and hands down my favorite is at Archi's.  If they would offer curry puffs I wouldn't need to go anywhere else.  Best Thai tea.  The lunch specials provide more than enough food, although I would like to be able to choose the soup that comes with it (it's soup of the day; no choices) as sometimes they serve a soup I don't care for.  I've always seen an \"A\" rating when I go there and service is consistently very good.  I can visit any of the Archi's restaurants and the food flavors are consistently very good.",

We were seated right next to the kitchen. No one came to get our order, we actually didn't even see someone who we could wave down in the kitchen. I actually had to call the front after about 20 minutes of no one coming. I told them we are the table in the back and no one has came. They didn't even apologize or offer any type of appetizer or something as an apology. Then when we went to order, me and my boyfriend alerted the server we were vegan. He pretty much told us that our food then would be bland because fish oil is what makes their flavor. I couldn't believe it. Every other restaurant, including the other location of Archie's has never said this or had the problem of making their food vegan and still taste good. It was ridiculous. We got the pad Thai and sweet and sour tofu. The pad Thai was good, but the sweet and sour tofu was awful. No other Thai or Asian restaurant I've encountered has had a problem with this dish being vegan. Then I asked for the spices like chili paste. They didn't have chili paste. We had to get up and ask three different people for the spice rack. It was the worst experience. Stay away, and take your business else where to the other new better Thai restaurants in town.",

The decoration or theme makes you feel as if you're in someones house and the seats are very comfortable.  Good service and a nice clean restaurant.  Now as far as the food goes, Archi's is one of the best thai food in Vegas.  Everything is good but my favorite, which I also recommend is the spicy eggplant (you have an option of which meat you'd like too add on it). There pad thai is is great too but the one in asian thai cuisine is slightly better, but still delicious nonetheless.   I recommend this Archi's over the other one because of its interior theme and comfortable eating.  It gets pretty busy during the evening so I suggest coming in the early afternoons so you can enjoy the food in peace.",

We went for lunch and we got our food really fast. too fast maybe lol. I had the chicken pad thai and thai ice tea. The food was chewy. Idk if thats how it's supposed to be because again, i'm not really that familiar with thai food. It tasted kinda bland. Not saying it was bad tho. The tea was very strong and it tasted like if whatever caramel or sugar or whatever is they out in there, was burnt. when the ice melted i enjoyed it more. it was okay. Later on that night i was getting cravings for the pad thai sooooo... couldnt have been that bad, right? lol.",

Great Pad Thai, Curry, Fried Rice, and sweet and sour pork.  The dinner prices are average but the lunch specials are great.  For $8 you can have the soup of the day, a spring roll, salad and your meal which is a very large portion.  The only inconsistency is the service.  Most days the service is friendly and fast but on an occasional busy lunch, the service can be slow and you may find yourself feeling unwanted.  I caution going to Archi's at exactly 12 noon.  Other than that one complaint, Archi's is near the top of the Las Vegas Thai food scene.",

The Panang Curry is my favorite here of all the other places I've tried.  Pro-tip: they'll ask you if you want spicy level 1-10.

    "text": "This Archi's location is just down the street from my temporary housing arrangement, and I pass by it regularly on my way to my doctor's appointment.  It is located in a fairly old strip mall on W. Flamingo and timing was perfect today for me to drop in for a quick lunch and check out what Yelpers have said was a reasonably priced lunch special from a Thai restaurant.   When I arrived around 11:30am, there were already several tables occupied with diners having their lunch.  But I was quickly greeted by one of the petite waitresses and seated at a large table that can comfortably seat 4 or 6.  I felt a little guilty since I was dining alone.  But it didn't end up being an issue since the restaurant didn't get packed as I thought it was based on how hectic the place gets during the mad rush of the lunch crowd.  Anyway, I noticed that their selections of lunch specials is rather small compared to their entire menu offerings.  But I went with their Red Curry with Chicken and also ordered a Thai Iced Coffee.  The waitress soon returned with a really generous size glass of Thai Iced Coffee, it is definitely the largest glass of Iced Coffee I have ever been served. Happy Surprise = +1 on my Yelp meter.  The Red Curry with Chicken was alright.  The flavor of the curry and the 5 spiciness on the Thai spicy scale was good. But the chicken was really tough, and I didn't care for it at all. The egg roll served is 99% out of the box, and you can really taste the prominent white pepper in the filling or the wrapper.  Ambiance is good, the dining area is rather small, but it didn't bother me. And during lunch there was good amount of ambient lighting from outside, which I believe is a good thing.  Anyway, I am going to have to come back and try some more of the cooking of the Thai mothers and grandmothers working in the back. Because I was seated at the table facing the small window where the kitchen passes the prepared plates to be served, and all I see are a bunch of women on the other side working in the kitchen.",

The order of thai tea sure helped! Their lunch items average anywhere from $7.95-9.95 and it comes with your normal soup, salad, eggroll, fried crunch, rice, and entree of choice. Very filling :)  The wait staff was friendly and the restaurant itself was clean, although I think I prefer the newer & more spacious rainbow and 215 location.

Pork requires longer cook time than beef/chicken so the meat gets infused with the seasoning.  Chicken was good, but pork was better.   I like my spicy basil dish dry, not wet, and for the most part, Archi's does make the dish dry.  A wet dish means it wasn't cook long enough to infuse the meat with the flavors.  Unfortunately, the dish is inconsistently cook (sometimes wet and not as flavorful) so removing one star.  The other dishes that I tried were ok, but I didn't try many because I almost always got my favorite dish.  Note that the restaurant sign outside does not light up \"Archi's\", only \"Thai Kitchen\".  So when you are looking for it in the dark, concentrating on finding a restaurant named Thai Kitchen because the Archi's is invisible.  Parking is plentiful out front (strip mall).    The restaurant inside is warm and comfortable.  Service is very friendly.",

So for a regular hole in the wall type of Thai Restaurant this is by far the best Thai food in the west coast.  I've ordered just about everything on the menu and every single one has been great.  So if you're the typical white person who always orders pad Thai or a more adventurous person that goes deep in the menu, you absolutely will not be disappointed.   I usually go to the location on Rainbow, but this place is great as well.  By the way...careful with the door. It gets hot.",

    "text": "This is a good Thai restaurant! I happen to be on Flamingo when I saw Archi's Thai Kitchen. I quickly made a turn in the Phoenix Plaza and this restaurant is located next to a bakery. I was seated right away and their menu has a good selection of salad, soup, seafood, noodles, rice and curry. You have an option to make your entree as vegetarian or you can pick your choice of protein like chicken, pork, beef, or tofu. I notice they have mochi ice cream as part of their dessert and there are just a few beverage I see like Thai iced tea, coffee, juice, and soft drinks.   I request for hot tea ($1.95) to go with my order and got the Spicy Basil ($10.95). For this entree, you have an option which meat you want and I opt for ground chicken, which is sauteed with zucchini, bell peppers, garlic, chili, fresh basil and it's serve with steamed rice. Food arrive within 15 minutes and the Spicy Basil Chicken taste amazing! The meat is season well and full of delicious basil flavor, it has the right amount of heat and not too spicy. I like how the vegetables are nicely sauteed with the meat making this dish very satisfying. I highly recommend ordering this entree for your first visit.   For appetizers, I had Thai Egg Rolls ($5.95) which are deep fried egg rolls stuffed with clear noodles and vegetables and it's serve with plum sauce that looks similar to a sweet chili sauce. The eggs rolls are serve hot and it is very crunchy. I actually like the noodles inside these egg rolls, it's quite tasty but I wish there is an option to add some of that spicy basil chicken, it will definitely make it a lot more appetizing!   I thought about getting Mochi Ice Cream but I was told they did not have any in stock, not even mango. So the only option left is Sweet Sticky Rice with Coconut Ice Cream ($7.95). When the server brought my dessert, I am amaze it looks like an ice cream sundae. Yay! The sweet sticky rice is sprinkled with toasted yellow mung beans and it is serve with a triple scoop of that yummy coconut ice cream topped with a maraschino cherry. It taste so good! I can't get enough of that coconut ice cream. I left the restaurant very happy and with a full tummy. Service is somewhat slow, but oh well the food is excellent and right now that is all that matter.",

The chicken fried rice (kowpot) was good but lacked sufficient protein and was missing the signature cucumber slices that differentiate True Thai kowpot from Chinese fried rice. Overall the food was 4+ stars but the service and speed deserves 5 stars. We lived in Thailand for a year and this is a good sampling of their culture.   Update: went back for a late dinner. Food was all poor quality. They added raw green beans to the Papaya salad which ruined the taste completely. It was actually quite horrible. We tried the Pad Thai again and again it was dry. They completely forgot about our last dish we ordered and didn't bring it until prompted by us. It was Mongolian beef which was not at all. Maybe the beef but they added it to a sweet and sour mix of veggies that were part raw and part over cooked. Bad experience all around for a semi-expensive meal.",

The servers were very patient was our large party, even when we requested to switch tables due to the sunshine shining through the windows and basically blinding us from seeing anything. Not only were they patient, they were also very informative in helping us order and had a sense of humor.  We ordered Red Curry with Chicken, Pad Thai with Seafood, Pad See-Ew with Beef, Tom Yum with Chicken, and two Thai Ice Teas. I particularly enjoyed the Pad See Ew and the Tom Yum. Their Pad See- Ew and Pad Thai weren't excessively greasy, like many places I've been to before. The Pad See-Ew was perfectly flavored, not too sweet nor savory. The Tom Yum was so refreshing, with a balance of spice and sourness.  I enjoyed my visit at Archi's Thai Kitchen. Parking, food, and service were all amazing! If you're looking for a good thai restaurant in Vegas, make sure to make a visit at this restaurant! Your taste buds would thank you.",

    "text": "Arguably the best Thai food in Vegas. The Archi's restaurants have the best consistently good food hands down. Archi's Thai Kitchen is my favorite because it feels more like a home kitchen.  Located near Torrey Pines and Flamingo intersection, it stands alone as the only worthwhile eatery in the shopping center it is located in. But due to its slightly nondescript location, it doesn't have the same traffic as the Bistro and Cafe. I've never had to wait for a table and service has always been good.  The drive through is a little hit or miss. Having a \"go-to take out\" location very close to where you live is such a rockin' thing, but the drive through doesn't always work like you'd want it to. Most of the time you pull up and have to wait until somebody on the waitstaff notices you at the window, which during busy times may be 5 or so minutes. But that's pretty much it in the way of criticism...  The food quality is consistent and good. The spice level, 1-10, has good range.One thing to note is that the spice intensity seems to vary with the cook. Also, test any takeout before you dive in, especially if you're getting multiple orders of the same thing with different spice levels.   I've eaten at almost every thai place in town and this is my first suggestion for anyone who asks.",

I've also mixed in some Ginger Chicken lunch specials at times and really enjoyed that as well.  The main reason for the update?  I swear their spice levels have gone up a notch.  The last two times I've gotten my usual 7, my mouth has been burning more than I was used to before.   Not in a bad way, but I wouldn't mind a little consistency.    They've also updated their take out containers lately to this fancy schmancy plastic numbers instead of the styrofaom standard.  I'm into it.  If Thai Food drivethrus ever spread like wildfire across all countries, the goal of world peace would become more viable.",

    "text": "What a delicious last meal in Vegas, all thanks to Archi's Thai Kitchen, I'll will be back!   Dishes: Fresh Springs Rolls, Chicken Pad Thai, Beef Pad Thai and Shaved Ice  (Pictures will be posted)  Archis has a VERY friendly waiting staff! As for the atmosphere, it has this vintage and inviting feeling like a house! It was nice enough so you didn't feel cramped. I would highly recommended trying the pad thai! Coming from NYC, and having a love for Asian cuisine this is probably one of my top two places. The shaved ice desserts is deceiving because it was not shaved ice. When I think of shaved ice, I think of Malaysian Ais kacang (ABC). This seems more like a type of ice cream but the texture is different from store bought brands. The shaved ice here is some type of ice cream topped with condensed milk and boba! I would still recommended this dish as well.   The only reason this restaurant did not get five stars was because of the Fresh Springs Rolls. Fresh Springs Rolls reminds me a lot like sushi.The steamed rice paper that wrapped the other sides is unable to hold all the other ingredients. When you pick it up everything falls apart making it very hard to eat.",

Hubby ordered pad thai for his entree. But I wouldn't order pad thai here. Overall I enjoyed my dish. I think the green curry came out great. I finished the whole plate *:)~  I do recommend the green curry. We'd visit again the next time our trip brings us to Vegas. Enjoy!",

    "text": "I feel the need to preface this review with the disclaimer that I was spoiled, horribly, after living near the Argyle stop in Chicago for a few years. (For the uninitiated, this was basically Thai Food Paradise.) So my standards might be pretty high. And Archi's had been hyped; I'd been told by a lot of native 'Vegans that Archi's is \"The Best Thai\"...and I feel like I'm about to Blaspheme.  The food's not bad. It's quite decent. But it's nothing terribly special, to me. The pad thai is good, but not in any way that sets it apart from the other pad thais in vegas. The curries are again, good, but their flavor seems to rely more on heat than the build of flavors in curries that truly knock my socks off. That seems to be what Archi's does well; everything is at least \"decent\". Nothing is bad. But nothing is amazing, either. I have never craved Archi's; I crave the Panang Curry at Pan Asian, or the Pad thai from Prin Kaow, nor whatever it is my husband always orders from Weera. Archi's is a safe bet, a good lunch place, decent takeout with a group.  But it doesn't have any favorites. It has no \"Woah. I must tell someone.\" Factor. So, in conclusion:  Pros: - Nothing noticeably bad in many visits. - Polite staff, reasonable wait times, several locations. - Starbucks of thai; you will get exactly what you expect, every time.   Cons: - Nothing noticeably great in many visits. - A lot of \"Americanized\" thai dishes, not as much variety as one could hope for. - Starbucks of thai; you will get exactly what you expect, every time.",

The building is nothing fancy, actually pretty plain inside, but it was a nice spot to enjoy catching up with old friends.  It was very quiet inside event though there were a handful of tables with people eating (maybe thats a sign of good food??)  the service was amazing.  I was pretty thirsty so i was downing the water in the smaller sized cup they give you and it never was empty.  The servers were there constantly to take care of any needs, but they werent overly attentive and only seemed to show up when we needed something.  I didn't get anything crazy and just had the garlic chicken tonight, but it was great.  I have heard of levels of heat, but she only asked us none, med, or hot.  I chose medium thinking of what people have told me of \"thai hot\" but the medium was actually very mild.  nice place, decent prices, awesome service.  very good experience.",

It wasn't too sweet and was just how I like my pad thai. The shrimp was nothing spectacular though. - Eggplant and Beef: SOO GOOD! I admit I'm not a big fan of eggplant, but this dish was very good. The beef was cooked perfectly. Not chewy at all.  - Masaman Curry with Chicken: This was my least favorite dish out of the 4 we ordered. It was a little too rich for my taste. Don't get me wrong. I am a big fan of all types of curries and I usually like the creamy Thai curries, however this one was just a little too much for my taste. The potatoes were a little undercooked and the chicken a little overcooked and rubbery.   Service GREAT! Amazing! They are so attentive and friendly.   Ambiance: Like a small casual cafe/mom&pop shop. We expected a fast food type of place seeing that it had a drive thru, but we were surprised with the casual nice setting.   I'll definitely be stopping by at Archi's whenever I'm in Vegas! Simply delicious!!",

Nice paintings, comfy seats and clean tables - just a nice place to dine.  If you are staying in Vegas strip, this is only like 10mins. Go there and check it out. You won't be disappointed.  Cons: the place is kinda hidden. You may have to drive around in the parking lot to find it. They don't accept AMEX.",

    "text": "The Archi's Thai restaurants in Las Vegas are my \"go-to\" restaurants for myself and my visitors, who have never been disappointed and ask to go there again at their next visit.  I love the Country Curry at Archi's Thai Kitchen, as well as the vegetable fried rice. I like what my friends order as well.   I am vegetarian and there are plenty of vegetarian choices.  The waitresses are good and always ask me if egg is okay (in the fried rice), since they are familiar with a vegetarian's needs.  They refill the drinks often.  Although I definitely know True Thai food (I ate homemade Thai food nearly daily for seven years that was prepared by many different immigrant Thai women) I like Archi's because I can order the amount of spice I need, versus eating the usually very spicy food at the center I attended nearly daily.   It might be a little \"Americanized\" with some dishes, but as long as my guests love it, and I love it,  I don't care.  I usually see a few Thai families at Archi's, though predominantly a mixture of other races.  It is a pleasant demographic. What I really love most about Archi's is the consistently very, very fresh vegetables and food.  I also like that the Clark County Health Department gives \"A\" grades to Archi's (I stay up on that).  I took visitors to Archi's a few months ago but it was too busy at lunch, so I took them down the street to a more expensive well-known Thai restaurant that has had good Las Vegas Review Journal reviews in many years past) and it was definitely not fresh food like I get at Archi's, and that is an understatement.  If Archi's is a little more Americanized in that way it is  okay with me.  I have ordered Archi's take-out for parties at home and it is always a big hit.",

We looked to Yelp for dinner choices because we did not want to get stuck in more traffic on Las Vegas Blvd, did not feel like walking in our high heels, preferred to spend our dollars on booze, and were sick of 24-hour cafe food choices.   We ended up at Archi's for a quick, cheap and tasty meal. We shared some Fried Wontons, Seafood Soup, Pad Thai and Chicken Yellow Curry (all spiced to # 6). All had excellent flavor and were perfectly spiced (I know it is spiced correctly when my nape is sweating even while my tightly clipped bun is still dripping from my shower).  The service was quick, the prices are reasonable, definitely a must-eat if looking to venture off the strip.",

I wouldn't have to get outta my car in my stinky, bacteria infested work clothes, turn my car off, turn my car on, waste more gas... bla bla bla.. Yeah, the drive-thru really got my blood pumping.  Upon getting there, I almost passed it. I saw the drive-thru easily, but I wondered how anyone could eat inside?? Looked so tiny.. Maybe I will have to discover that at a later time.    I got my green curry, #6 spicy home, and it was still piping hot after my 30 min drive. Archi's definitely does not skimp out on the content in their curry, plenty of chicken, plenty of bamboo shoots, basil, and plenty of zucchini(which is the first I have had in my curry.. yumm). And they give you just enough rice:]   Not a complaint, I was a happy girl with my curry take out. So, why not 5 stars? Because it's not. Yay! I'm a fan. We will keep it as that.",

And they were right. My aunt (who cooks the most AMAZING Thai food) loved everything we ordered:  1) \"Oyster Pancakes\"   2) Pad Lad Na   3) Moo Krapow (Pork Krapow)  4) Yum Woonseen (Glass  noodle salad)  5) Moo Pad Prick (Pork tossed in a chili based sauce)  6) Khang Bhaa (Clear soup curry with veggies and meats)   #1-5 all tasted pretty darn authentic to me, too!   #4 was super spicy! (Maybe bc I'm a weak sauce Thai person...)  #6 wasn't on the menu, so my uncle special ordered it - he didn't think it was all that and feels that you should just stick to ordering things on the menu because that probably wasn't something they knew how to make properly..  ---AMBIANCE--- This restaurant is pretty small, and on a Thursday night for 5 people - we had to wait about 15 minutes before being able to sit.   The decor is very very simple with a few paintings scattered here and there. They play very soft Thai classical music in the back that made me feel like I was in Thailand momentarily...  ---SERVICE--- My aunt was very impressed with the waitresses -- who were all very sweet, smiley, efficient, and polite. (Thai elders are very hard to impress...and they were thoroughly impressed).  ---VALUE--- Huge amount of food! We had tons left overs.  Supponsingly you can come here for lunch and get a huge entree and an eggroll for about $6.50.",

The chicken skewers were huge but when I bit into them it was mostly fried and dark meat which I didn't really like. At first, it was good but then the grease got to me. The cucumber salad helped with that and I had some of my sister's rice which was very flavorful for white rice. Her husband ordered a shrimp curry that looked really good. He said it was good but not as good as this other Thai place in Chicago. The place was set up really nice considering it was in a strip mall. Lastly, those had to be the most comfortable chairs I've ever sat in while eating at a table in a restaurant! I could sit in those all njght!",

    "text": "It is finally time to write a review for a restaurant that's grown up with me. As many others, I too remember a time when Archi's was an obscure & tiny Thai restaurant on Flamingo. If I had written a review even up until 2 years ago, I would've given them five stars. But now, things have changed. We've both grown up and moved on to \"bigger and better\" things. However, with an increase in size and popularity (and price), has come a decrease in quality, quantity of food, and service. It is a sad and tragic tale that hopefully might turn around soon?   I miss that restaurant. Now, the food is simply just okay. The portions have gotten significantly smaller and the prices have gone up. The flavor explosions that I would experience earlier have turned into a decently pleasant experience. I love that you control your own level of spiciness. As a Korean family, we always opt 6 or higher  Now, to the food!   1. Papaya Salad: Always consistent and fresh! My family and I always ask for $3 extra. It's a great dish to clean off your palette to start off a meal. 2. Pad Kee Mao: Any flat Thai noodle dish is a fave of mine, but I just love this dish. It has a great blend of textures with the chewy from the noodles and the crunch from the lettuce and also has a little kick to it.  3. Spicy Basil Beef: This dish is okay. It's essentially minced meat seasoned with basil and other vegetables. It's a good lunch dish and is to be eaten with rice. It can be a bit salty at times.  4. Red Curry: This dish has its good times and bad times. I love the depth of the coconut milk but I have received the dish a bit watery with less variety of vegetables.  5. Catfish Delight: If you're looking for something a little different, I think this is a GREAT dish. Crispy catfish in that blend of I don't even know what! It's amazing! It's a literal foodgasm! The catfish is always fried to the perfect crispiness. TIP: Try to eat it right away or the catfish will get soggy... 6. Eggplant & Tofu: As a former Vegetarian, I like this dish with fried tofu. The blend of favors is great. HOWEVER, there are times when the eggplant is cooked inconsistently and many times when the eggplant is undercooked.  7. Pad Thai: I had to review this dish right? It's a mainstream staple! Archi's Pad Thai is stil the best I ever had. I will profess. It's not too sweet, it's not to sour, it's not too salty. It's always just right.   If you work a day job. Archi's also a great place to pick up lunch to-go! There's a drive-thru that makes it convenient. Overall, yes, this place has a spot in my heart, but it has started to deteriorate ever since I have left abroad for school.",

My only complaint with my dish, was that the tofu was only lightly fried. It was pretty soggy. It had a good flavor, but really would have liked it with a bit more crisp. The wife's lard nar was really good. The noodles were some of the best I've had. The gravy was a bit soupy, more so than other lard nar's we've had. The Thai iced tea was great.

Be careful to order things on the spicy side here, because they deliver, you're entire mouth will be en fuego.  You can always ask for the spiciness on the side, as I often do.  I really do believe the test of a good Thai restaurant is if the food tastes good the next day, and Archi's definitely passes.",

Example we had shrimp pad Thai and chicken larb yesterday and it was fantastic. We ordered a level 5 spicy but could've been hotter. That's the only downside you're never sure how hot the chef will make it but either way it's pretty darn good. The rainbow food always tastes fishey no matter what you order and not in a good way.",

The yellow curry chicken was perfect, the sauce was very creamy and flavorful, no cornstarch !! thank you Archi, the pad thai noodles, #5 spicy were yummy with great flavor!   we ordered two beek dishes, the beef was very moist and delicious , their rice is fluff and flavorful, we had to wait about half an hour it is worth every penny, a little higher priced that other local Thais restaurants !!",

It used to taste like they actually cared about upholding a standard but now it tastes like status quo. Anyway I guess I have to try other Thai restaurants which I have and I've only liked Lotus.

We started our lunch out with a Papaya Salad, something new for us, but quite delicious.  My wife had Kung Pao Chicken, my daughter had Chicken Fried Rice and I had the Pad Thai Chicken.  We all went with the #5 seasoning and found it perfect.  Our drink glasses never got empty, something my daughter appreciates, haha.  We got to the restaurant around 11:30am and were able to be seated right away, but by the time we left they were getting pretty busy.  Even with that, all of the staff, from bus persons to servers were all very attentive and friendly.  We really enjoyed the atmosphere, the Bistro is not that big, so even though they were getting busy, it still wasn't so noisy that we were not able to carry on a conversation at our table.  We will definitely be back to Archi's again.  Highly recommended.",

The green curry was absolutely delicious! I can't wait to order it again, my favorite by Fay. Spicy Thai basil was good and I would order again, but save most of it for the next day because it was just one of those things that tasted better that way. The pad Thai however, was not good. Mediocre at best. Next time I'd try a different noodle.",

The ambiance is cozy, but a little weird.  You really feel like you're straight up at your auntie's house. No music..... so all you hear is distant awkward family convos and... silence. But the service is comparable to going to your aunt's too. Everyone there is very welcoming, kind, and warm.  The food was gooooooooooooooooooooooooood. And not just because it was my first time eating after three days... lol. I eat at Thai Town in Hollywood all the time so I wasn't expecting this place to compare, but it really did.  +tom kha - IT'S A MUST. Very different from every place I've ever tried. Coconut based, but they add a sour/spice flavor. Delicious...  +pad thai- wet and saucy... perfect mix of sweet and spicy.  +I'd choose the papaya salad over the beef salad if you're leaning towards one or the other. The beef was kinda hard to chew.... but the flavors were all there.   +crab fried rice - it was average... you taste more of the egg than the crab.",

Other favorites are pad prik king (they do not skimp on the ginger, which makes it even more delicious), pineapple fried rice (probably my favorite pineapple fried rice ever. They add curry or something that makes it different and more flavorful than others), and their curries.   There's a reason why this place is one of my family's to go place when we go out to eat, because their food is consistently good and delicious.   It's definitely one of those places in Vegas that I like to go to every time I visit.   Also, I love that they have a drive thru window when you get your food to go.

Both dishes came out and looked fine but really the flavor was horrible. Her pad Thai was the worst I've ever had (noodles were an odd consistency, flavor was off, she ordered it medium spicey but it was so mild that I wasn't sure the put any spice in). My sweet and sour chicken had a very strange taste to it overall.  Neither of us cared for the food at all and wound up just paying the bill and leaving, we didn't eat.  What a waste of $40.",

For the entrees the restaurant goer picks a dish and then whichever meat they would like: chicken, beef, pork, or tofu. Or for an additional charge one can add shrimp. Every dish can be ordered spicy on a scale of 1-10 and I usually order around 4-5, but I really like this spicy scale. I would highly recommend Spicy Eggplant and Spicy Basil. Tom Kha soup is wonderful and I enjoyed the Fried Tofu, Wontons, and Fish Cakes. I liked both the Green Curry and Yellow Curry, but Panang will always be my favorite Thai curry.",

The music wasn't too loud or distracting and the food... The food was awesome. I had the pineapple curry with just a dash of spice to kick it up and it was PERFECT!         Our server was attentive to our drinks, she checked in on us enough but not too much. She brought the check out when we were ready and didn't mind when we stayed and chatted a while once we were done.         I will return, I will bring more clients there and I can't wait to try other items on the menu.",

I like to go here with my boyfriend, and he likes to order pad thai with a very extra well-done fried egg on the side. I guess it can be kind of an odd request, so other restaurants that we've been to under cook the egg. However, at Archi's they always listen to exactly what we want. One time the egg came out and my boyfriend took a bite of the egg. It wasn't completely well done, but it was definitely nothing to send back or worry about. But our server noticed it immediately and asked if we wanted a new egg. We politely declined because we didn't want to hassle the cooks, but the server brought one out anyway. I loved how attentive he was to our order. The staff is very friendly and they don't mind joking around with us.   The service and food is what puts Archi's on another level. This is definitely my go-to place, and sometimes I wish I could eat there everyday for lunch because the lunch specials are a great price and include great portions as well. Overall, highly recommended!",

Three stars for promot service, pick up was less than 30mins.   I would give one more star except the flavor was not flavorful. It was somewhat bland, just okay and edible. Also \"medium spicy (5 in a scale of 1-10)\" is pretty much the same as \"not spicy\". I had two dishes to compare, no difference, no kick. I ordered for myself spicy Pineapple beef curry and no spicy sweet and sour chicken, spicy pad Thai.   And biggest complaint of all, I found two long strands of dark hair in my husband's pad Thai. I didn't just find it.... the longest strand of hair was in my mouth mixed with the noodles!!!!!! Ugh.   It's not the worst thing in the world but please tuck your hair back when cooking/carrying/packing the food. It's kind of gross especially I don't know if this person washed their hair or had lice they didn't tell anyone about. Definitely not from my short blonde hair or husbands bald head.  Overall, I'll stick to our koonyai's homemade dishes but if you want a restaurant style meal, there are better places than this one - not impressed.",

I usually order the Po Tak soup and Chicken Panang Curry sauce with extra veggies. It comes with rice. When I don't get soup, the Pork Satay with peanut sauce is usually my alternate choice. The satay is the best I've ever had because of its tender, large chunks of meat, and the peanut dipping sauce.   He usually gets the Pad Kapow (pork) and the Pad Thai (chicken). They are excellent.  My favorite dessert in the summer is their fresh imported mangos with sticky rice and coconut milk.   They add spices according to your liking and tolerance level. I like my food a little spicy - but not hot. A three is perfect for me in the summer and a four in the winter. He usually gets a level 10, and I usually watch as he drools and eats packets of sugar.   I enjoy their Jasmine hot tea, the excellent service, clean restaurant, and atmosphere. Ask for Ten, she's the best server.",

There was a TON of oil at the bottom of the bowl which suggests two theories, one.... there was too much moisture from the frozen chicken being thawed or two ......they just used a ton of oil to give moisture to the precooked chicken.  As far as flavor... It was okay. Had they cooked the chicken fresh, it would have been so much better. I probably won't come back because I know thai places that cook with fresh ingredients.",

They're not far, but...when you're really hungover, and looking for something quick to eat, you don't want to have to drive anywhere.  That being said, we could have chosen to order from a place that DOES deliver, so, not a deal breaker for us.  My fella and I were nursing hangovers on Sunday, so we placed an order and he went to pick the food up, while I stayed in bed with the blankets over my head.  We ordered:  Shrimp pad thai:  Meh.  the shrimp was REALLY dry.  the noodles were decent.    Chicken pad thai:  Meh...little sub par for me, really...I liked the pad thai at the monastery food fair better, and that had tofu in it. (and I generally do NOT like tofu AT ALL.)  Masaman curry:  THIS was good.  Really good.  Not too spicy (I'm a wuss), and it had plenty of chicken, and potatoes.  If I could make one change, I'd have them send more rice with it...I ended up having to make a cup of rice this morning for my leftover curry for lunch.  Not a big deal, but...it would have been nice to have everything ready.  Thai coffee:  standard.  So...all in all...this is not the best Thai food I've ever had, but its certainly not awful.  I'd order from here again, and might even venture out to eat in their dining room to experience the service.",

Coming here, I wasn't particularly impressed by either the food or service.  Ordered takeout, taking advantage of their drive-up window and their lunch menu available til 3PM- opted for the pad thai and red curry, ordered by phone on my way out the door from my office. Arrived on time and pulled up as instructed, only to sit there for five minutes without being acknowledged by the woman standing just inside at the register. At first I thought maybe she didn't see me, but several people walked up and talked to her, and made eye contact with me and a comment to her. Generally I expect to be acknowledged when I'm waiting, even if it's just to say sorry it'll be a couple of minutes- I prefer that over being ignored by far.  Got home with my dishes, good portions for lunch pricing- $8/per person. Pad thai was a large portion of noodles, chicken was a little on the dry side, dish was a little spicier than expected for a 3 but reasonable. Curry was a 4, which was quite spicy and BF did not care for the spice level but the veggies were fresh and the beef was a good portion. Appreciated that the rice was fresh and fluffy, offset the spiciness of the curry. Both dishes served with a wonton and spring roll- tasty and not overly crispy.  Would swing by to take advantage of lunch pricing again, but after all the hype I simply felt the product wasn't amazing but rather just average.",

Love the food .  I had the Spicy Basil Chicken and they ask you on a scale of 1 to 10 how spicy you want .  I got the 8 because I love a kick .  My son got the Mongolian Chicken with a 5 and we got an order of Chicken Fried Rice at a 7 .  I was really surprised at the big slices of Chicken in their fried rice , so many places skimp on that , not this place and it tasted great .  My sons Mongolian was sweet with a little hot and my Basil Chicken was perfect .  We had plenty left over for the next day and it also came with two white rice containers and that rice was perfectly cooked .  We love Asian Food and this is probably one of the best I have had in Las Vegas , no kidding .  I have had Thai Food before , but this is tops !  The dining area is small , but we ordered ours to go , so no problem .  They were full the night we went , but our food was prepared in a reasonable short time .  I will be going back .  I want to try the Pineapple Chicken Fried Rice next time .",

    "text": "I've been coming here for years. This place is the absolute best Thai cuisine you will ever eat, period. Then an exclamation point!  My fave dishes is the eggplant spicy. I usually order the eggplant spicy with tofu because it feels like I'm getting more food, though it's delicious with the beef, too.   You also order your food based on how spicy you want it...  \"Spicy number 4,\" my dining companion might say to the waiter.   I think the spiciness levels depend on who's in the back cooking that day, but go for spicy number 7. Ask for the spice caddy if your spice level isn't enough.   What else....  The panang and the other curries are very good, too. The only time I have been disappointed with my experience at Archi's is when I ordered the Thai pancake. It looks better than it tastes, trust me.

    "text": "The Skinny: solid Thai food in a comfortable atmosphere (3.5) service - they'll get your food on the table but bring your own beverage 'cause refills are slow in coming (2) value - come here for lunch, not for dinner (3).  When I have a hankering for pad thai or green papaya salad, I head here. I do it because a)it's close, b) it's not divey like Lotus of Siam (which is close to the infamous Green Door... dive!), c) their prices are reasonable during lunch time.  The pad thai is a little too spartan on the protein, a little on the sweet side, and a little on the wetter side than I like. Sometimes it does lack \"wok-hey\" depending who's cooking (what we Asians call \"wok air\" - meaning the heat of the wok required for that slight char on stirfried dishes), it's flavourful enough to warrant subsequent visits.  The pad see-ew tastes good but occasionally suffers from use of poor parts of chinese broccoli (gailan). The resturant does not strip the outer fibrous, bitter stem to the more tender middle parts which would definitely improve the dish.  The spicy eggplant with thai basil again has nice flavours but the overall greasiness of the dish is off-putting (but then again eggplant is really hard to stirfry, period). The green papaya salad is fresh and goes well with the oppressive Vegas heat.  The real value is at lunch time. You can get various offerings for only $6.95 which is good for a thai restaurant. Also at this location, they have unlimited refills of certain sodas which they don't have at the Summerlin/W. Sahara branch.  As for service, expect to be served with efficiency so that the tables can be filled by other patrons. Don't expect that your beverage glass will be looked after quickly either. Lunch time is hectic at this location so get here a little earlier than noon or after 1pm to avoid waiting.",

    "text": "Have gone twice so far to this location and have not gone to the other locations yet.   I do understand why people say it's good and I must go to try it, but it's a steep cliff to say it's up with the best Thai ever. Had lots of Thai friends in LA and lived a stone throw from LA's Thai Town.   First time-  I grab the \"basics\" usually on the first go at a place to see how things measure up. Sure they may have a standout exotic dish, but if they can't cook the staples of their culture- it's not gonna cut it. So ordered a chicken panang and some ground pork with basil and some spring rolls. The panang was pretty good- just different from what I normally have as it had a heavier hand in coconut cream than most places I've experienced it. Different, but good. Pork basil is good, but really...can you fuck up ground pork, zucchini, basil and chilies? Its just a simple comfort food I like.   Next time we grabbed another of the panang and this time did a pad thai. I'm not sure about the pad thai...it was good enough, but was missing something flavorwise I couldnt pinpoint...maybe needed more tamarind? I hear good things about the Pad Thai so I don't know if this is an off day or  what my palette is looking for is different, but I'll give it another shot the next time around.   Service is friendly, but not the most attentive at times with our lady going to the back for long periods of time.  Portions and price is very fair, we had a bit of left overs for my lunch the next day.   I at least see that they are trying to keep things authentic and made with love here so I can appreciate that. Good if I'm in the area, but I wouldn't drive this far specifically for this spot as its rather far from where I live.",

    "text": "\"Hurts so good\"...it's gotta be the theme song to Archi's.  This place needs a disclaimer or some kinda waiver form.  They need to let you know that if you want to be macho and order some spicy food, they are gonna beat you like a 2 dolla ho.  my goodness, this place is serving up some super spicy food...on to the experience...we arrive around noon on Sunday and are promptly seated.  Menu looks to have typical thai fare and I roll with the pad kee mao which is flat rice noodles with veggies, basil and your choice of meat.  I order the beef and then comes the million dollar question:  How spicy would you like that sir?  That's so loaded when you're asked that in front of  a bunch of friends.  it's like the 'do these jeans make me look fat' question.  it's complicated.  I like spicy food and at thai places around the bay area, i order med-hot and i can finish my food and enjoy the heat.  Here, they have a scale of 1-10 here so I feel like 7 is pretty safe.  That along with a thai iced tea seemed like a safe choice and then it begins...  the noodles came out piping hot and it honestly did not look spicy.  there wasn't any chili oil or a bunch of chili flakes.  It looked like a great dish of noodles...until i took my first few bites.  holy hell, the noodles were marinated in devil piss or something.  I could not stop sweating.  halfway through my dish, it looked like i ran a marathon.  beads of sweat running down my cheeks.  The thai iced tea was my life line.  I was a sweating mess by the end and I couldn't finish my food because the heat was too punishing.  Don't get me wrong, the food was delicious.  flavor profile was great,  but it was....painful.  minus 1 star for no warning on the heat scale being off the charts.  Order a 4 or a 5 and enjoy the food.  Seriously.  If you challenge the heat, remember this:   Hot In and Hot Out.",

They mumbled to each other in there foreign language some crap while they processed my refund.  Not once did they apologize for the inconvenience they caused.

    "text": "This place is \"GUILTY\" of turning me into a half Thai. I've been eating here 1 or 2x a wk, every wk ever since I moved to Vegas 4 yrs ago. Never had the cravings too much for Thai food before. Archi's is truly the best Thai place I've ever been to. I definitely have lots of favorites here: Pad See Ew, Panang Curry, Pineapple Fried Rice, Pad Thai of course, Spicy Eggplant, Pad Prik King...but even after having them over and over again, I can't get tired of them. The \"new\" dishes that I try periodically don't disappoint me either. Heard the original owner, Mr. Archi was a taxi driver here in town long ago, right? Thank God, he gave up that job~!",

    "text": "Went for lunch on Saturday.  We split the Pad Thai as an appetizer, and each ordered a curry dish, plus Thai iced teas.  The Pad Thai is amazing, however we found both the Panang and Country Curry disappointing.  The place is really small, feels like sitting in someone's living room, but the service was very good.  I'd definitely go back, the pad thai alone is something I'll probably be craving later.",

The serves are always coming to check on you and are very courteous. The place is super clean. Fresh vegetables, great portions, and service is excellent. This place is my absolute favorite Thai food spot. They are quick with your order and they have never disappointed with the flavor and quality of their food. They only thing I disapprove of is they are closed one day of the week!! Lol",
