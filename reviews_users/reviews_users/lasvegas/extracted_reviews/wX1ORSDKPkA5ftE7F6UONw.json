    "text": "Very delicious chicken strips here.  They have 3 main options, baked, fried, and grilled(obviously, hence the name).  I tried the fried as my buddy tried the baked.  Very juicy and tender, and most importantly not too oily.  They have a large variety of sauces from buffalo, ranch, teriyaki to custom made sauces wasabi cream, and BFG.  Very delicious for the price and if you're craving for some chicken fingers id definitely recommend this place.  Service was probably the key selling point here as the owner/manager Jin i believe, was really nice and outgoing.  Small businesses like these makes me want to provide them with much support.",

    "text": "I see this place has a following and I don't know if I'm one of the many. Unless there's a separate group just for the creamy wasabi sauce, then yes. I'm in.   The place is cute and little and the boys that were working there when my family and I stopped by were SUUUPER friendly and helped us out a lot since we told them that it was our first time coming in.  I ordered the grilled chicken strips and my bf and baby got the crispy ones. The grilled chicken was delicious, I liked the panko breaded crispy ones and we ordered a bunch of sauces but none of them stood out like the creamy wasabi did. I honestly just want to go there and order a tub of that stuff so I can slather it on whatever I eat at home and other restaurants. Their grilled vegetables still had a lot of crisp to them (which I appreciate) and their french fries were......I can't remember. They're french fries. They were hot, crispy, and they had carbs.  I liked that the macaroni and cheese has a crusty top, but when I ate a spoonful of it, it really didn't blow me away. I mean it's faaaaaaar from being the disgusting kraft mac and cheese with the gross cheese powder, but I feel like the Velveeta Shells Mac N' Cheese is better.  Although they were pretty tasty, I didn't really leave the place excitingly planning out my next visit. It was sort of \"meh\" to me. Don't get me wrong, the place is great, friendly staff, and food is pretty good........buuuuut it just lacked something I just can't put my finger on.",

    "text": "Here's the cool thing about BFG: customization.  Unlike Chick-Fil-A and Raising Canes, BFG is a small and quaint restaurant that can be easily missed, tucked away in a plaza, and doesn't draw a lot of attention, except for the unusual design of its exterior.  However, unlike Chick-Fil-A and Raising Canes, you make your order in steps, which allows for multiple combinations of your meal, and is something that I like:  Step 1: Chicken You can order either baked, fried, or grilled chicken strips.  I ordered the fried, panko-crusted, chicken strips.  I was surprised how small each chicken strips were (so if you're hungry, order the 4-piece combo).  However, what they lacked in size, they made up for in quality.  The chicken strips were very meaty, very moist for white-meat, and the panko-crust made the strips feel light and a healthier choice as opposed to flour-crusted chicken strips.  Hint: fried chicken strips go especially well with the wasabi cream sauce.  Step 2: Side dish I've yet to try the baked mac & cheese and the grilled veggies, but the fries were pretty good.  I ordered to-go, so unfortunately, the heat and steam in the box made the fries soggy and less enjoyable, but I could still taste how potato-ey they were.  Hint: if you're going to order fries, don't order it to-go.  Step 3: Sauce BFG offers a plethora of sauces (Remember?  I like having choices).  I ordered the BFG and Wasabi cream sauce.  The Wasabi cream is hands-down the better of the two.  It has a touch of sweetness and a touch of spiciness, but is at a level anyone can tolerate.  I highly recommend it.  The BFG sauce wasn't as special.  It tasted similar to Thousand Islands.  Step 4: Drink Nothing different from other fast food restaurants.  Although, I bet you can switch out the drink in the order for Thai Iced Coffee for a little extra.  Last, but not least, BFG has especially quick service.  I got my meal in about 5 minutes.  Good food, fast service.",

They're not amazing, but they are satisfying (thin cut).  Got two funnel cakes before heading out!  One was strawberry and the other was chocolate!

The new staff is cool and the customer service is average now but in my old review I mentioned that I felt like a friend or a family member rather than just a customer. That statement is no longer True. It is because of this reason that my rating has dropped.  NOT TO WORRY THOUGH.  Nothing about the food has changed. Everything I have said about the food before still remains True. It's still awesome and still worth the trip. Good eats fellow Yelpers :)",

The staff is friendly and enthusiastic, and want you to enjoy what they know will be the best chicken strips you will have. The choices are limited but you can make so many different combinations that almost anyone can find a meal that works for them. They have a Coke freestyle machine which I love and Gold Peak tea too. The chicken comes baked, fried, or grilled and there are a delightful array of sauces. All the food here is delicious it just depends on what you want. If you are not in the mood for strips then let me recommend the nachos. They are cheap just like everything else on the menu and really good. You can get them to combine two orders into one massive nacho extravaganza. (I have never regretted this decision, although I don't always finish it.) All the sides are good but the mac and cheese is the perfect combination of delicious melty cheese and gooey cheese sauce, it's the perfect gourmand blend of cheap and delicious that you crave for comfort food.  I recommend the wasabi cream sauce, sweet chili and the house strip sauce. Enjoy!",

Baked, Fried, or Grilled. (BFG get it?)   The perfection of the chicken strip, what ever the cooking method  would easily make for a 5 star review, but wait, let's talk about the mac and cheese.  Bubbly hot, silky smooth and simply delicious. From the first mouth searing bite to the bitter end of licking the bowl clean, it is simply heaven. Woo-Hoo this sounds good, but wait, there is a another layer to drool over, the signature dipping sauces.   My personal favorite is the Wasabi cream.  Just enough heat to bring the tears, but so good you can't stop.  Bring  a straw and love the burn.  The thai sweet chili is very unique with a mild heat and a multitude of flavorful back tones. The honey mustard is subtle and is a nice counterpoint to the more powerful flavors mentioned above.  If you prefer something a bit more mellow,there are several more varieties for your consideration  We have perfectly prepared chicken, exceptional side dishes and incredible dipping sauces, what else could you ask for?  How about an owner that is the penultimate example of customer service?  If you come in every day or once a year, Jin always remembers your name and what you like, he personally greets you and makes you feel at home.    It doesn't get much better than this",

It's good but not life changing, world shattering, slap yo momma, marriage material mac and cheese. Again the owner was so sweet and checked on every table.

    "text": "absolutely fantastic. the food is seriously great! the fried strips have crispy panko breading, and the baked are super juicy and seasoned really well. you're looking at 5-6 bucks for a kid's meal (2 strips, 1 side and a sauce) and 6-7 for a 4 pc meal (4 strips, 1 side, 2 sauces and a slice of garlic bread), so it's super reasonable. the portion for fries is huge, so my mom couldn't even finish her kid's meal. whether you go for the fries or the mac n cheese, you'll be really happy! the funnel cakes (only around 2.50) are super fresh, too. and who doesn't love free refills? the freestyle machine is awesome. with that said, I'll also say that the employees are super friendly! I feel silly for not asking for his name, but our receipt says Matt, so I hope I'm getting it right when I say Matt was really nice! he checked up on us a few times when we ate, chatted a bit, and came out and waved when we got in our cab and left. seriously, if you're still on the fence about it, don't be. if you like friendly faces and chicken, you'll love the place!",

I'll admit they're good... we got two orders of the baked strips (one w/ fries, one w/ grilled vegies) and one kid's order of the fried strips. All were tender and juicy... I liked the flavor from the marinade on the baked strips... really good fries... great service, Jin checked in on us a few times making sure we enjoyed everything. This place is a much better option than going to Raising Cane's, esp. w/ the baked strips option. I just don't know if I'd drive across town to come here. Still good food, though. 3.5 Stars.",

    "text": "Stopped in here last week with a friend, and liked it so much I stopped in again a couple of days later. And I don't live anywhere near BFG. It's that good.   The first time in I had the fried strips which were cooked perfectly. The batter was excellent and not greasy at all. The chicken inside was moist and tasty. It comes with two dipping sauces. I tried the teriyaki and the honey mustard. Both were very good. Along with the strips I had the vegetable skewers, which also were really tasty. The meal came with a small piece of garlic toast and a drink.  My second time in I had the baked chicken strips which were moist and tender, and because I liked the veggie skewers so much the first time I got them again. Once again they came with Texas toast and a drink. All this for under 6 bucks.  During the first visit my friend asked me how these chicken strips compared to Cane's. It had been a long time since I'd been to Cane's, so today I went there to compare. Cane's was decent, but nowhere close to as good as the chicken strips here at BFG.  The service, as has been mentioned already here many times, was excellent. In fact the only complaint I have about this place is that it's so far from where I live. If they ever open one closer to me I'll be in there all the time.",

First off-place is packed-good sign. Greeted and was provided extremely personal service explaining everything to me as I had shared I was virgin :-) Got a 6 piece combo, (6 strips, 3 sauces, 1 side-I opted for Mac n Cheese-& a garlic bread). In addition, added another M&C, a side of grilled veggies, a Thai coffee and a chocolate funnel cake- so what do you think this cost? $18!!!!!! And it is delishhhh! Fresh and flavorful-recommend the strip, wasabi and of course the driving force on why it all began-hot sauce!",

You can get em baked, fried, or grilled. Hence the name.  The chicken, is finger licking good. They have a wide array of sauces but the most unique one is wasabi cream. I love that and the sweet chili, but they have about 8, so you might like something different.  The sides are where they really make their name.  The baked Mac and cheese is extremely creamy and a must try. They have chicken nachos, but I prefer to have them as chicken fries instead and mind= blown.  For dessert, they have funnel cake, which is not common Long story short, I'm definately gonna be coming back. Food was great, service was super friendly",

Anyway, I become acquainted with BFG from walking by it from the CSN Las Vegas campus. (Yes, human being are still capable of walking, believe it or not.) This is where the locals go, I had heard, but I was a local and I had never heard of it (or the former owner Jin).   In any case, they changed their name (unrelated to Jin) and subsequently included desserts to their very basic menu. It just so happened to be a dessert I yearn for on a regular -- unnaturally, regular really -- basis: funnel cake (2.25$). Score!  And their chicken is ultimately delectable. I prefer the Baked, then the Grilled, and finally the Fried. BGF. Always get the 6-piece (8.79$, as of this writing). The mac & cheese tastes so delicious, it makes me want to become a fan of mac & cheese (I am not). They have a bunch of sauces as well but I do not mess with anything besides cheddar cheese (is this the only place that has it?) and barbecue, since it is all that is truly needed in life.    The service is so friendly, personable, and funny, they make you want to return sooner than you intended. The loyalty programme has teeth too: there is a place for your birthday and anniversary (it could be your Yelpversary if you have no partner!) online and succeeding completion of your first survey, it should be only one more visit to go before receiving your complimentary Four-Strip Meal. How cool is that?   SDCS does not have the same roll of the tongue as BFG (Fuck Bone Grill), but there is room for some SDCC (ComicCon) parodying when it is that time of year (especially with the nerd [comic] store next door).   Needless to say, I vociferously recommend this business. It is not like there is really much else around anyway, especially if you are walking. Look both ways at the crosswalks. - E",

Staff was friendly, price was cheap, and most importantly the food was delish. I consider myself a chicken strips guy. They do seem a little juvenile, but damn a good fried piece of white chicken breast is just stellar for me. The strips might be considered small in size, but definitely made up for in numbers. The breading is very light but crispy nonetheless. Not very greasy in combination with the thin breading really highlighted the juice of the chicken. I got to try three different sauces. The baked mac was fab too!  I would put this in my list for spots to hit up in vegas when I have the time and the soberity. Yeah it is 15 min from the strip, but who cares!

The mac and cheese tasted out of the book you buy from the store with extra cheese and was put back in the oven for decoration.",

It's almost like a wannabe Raising Cane's with the added toast but my partner and I agreed Strip N Dip's chicken strips taste better! :)  There are 6-strip and 4-strip combos that include a toast, a side and up to 3 dips, drink not included. You can choose the way you want your strips to be tortured: fried, baked, or grilled. Based on the pictures I've seen on here, the mac n cheese is a popular side and its hardened, cheesy crust is the best part!   Damn, the strips were so piping hot, perfectly crisp, moist and tender to slice easily through my teeth. I think sharing these strips and dips with someone special can be an aphrodisiac ;)  I'll return! Too bad they don't have a drive-thru :/",

I was surprised he recognized my voice.  I guess I order a lot. Either way the customer service is great and the food is equally as great. Before coming to strip and dip much husband always are a 10 piece nugget from Wendy's, but too my surprise he picks the place over all any day of the week. It averages about 10-15 minutes depending on the order and even though there was a large catering ordering ahead of me (which Lez informed me over the phone) my order would still be ready in average time.  It's 109 degrees out today so I have no problem sitting in the AC until my order is complete.  Thank you to all of the strip and dip employees.  The food is great and customer service makes me feel like a VIP customer:-)",

They're all tasty, but I usually order the grilled chicken and grilled veggies.....and steal a few french fries off my husband's plate! You pick how many strips you want plus a side. The 4-strip meal comes with a small piece of garlic bread. And there are several dips to choose from including a \"house\" strip dip which is my favorite because I'm partial to Thousand Island dressing. It's great for lunch or a light dinner. The food is cooked to order, but if you're in a hurry, you can call and order ahead. The staff is always very friendly and will change out your dip(s) if you aren't happy with your first choice. I always leave here feeling satisfied, but not stuffed. And like I've eaten healthy!",

    "text": "Have to agree with the positive reviews posted about BFG Chicken Strips.  They serve a simple menu, but the execution of their chicken strips is spot on. Weather you order it baked, grilled or fried, it will be served hot, cooked and still moist inside. And Jin is seriously a master at friendly and personable customer service.  It is not rocket science, but when restaurants can deliver the winning combination of serving good food + exceptional customer service, it pretty much means the customer will have an awesome experience.  And for someone that dines out daily it really is a refreshing change to dine somewhere that do all the important things right.   I tried Combo #1 (maybe not the \"healthy\" combo, but it certainly does pack a lot of tasty flavor).  The fried chicken strips were very good (my second favorite).  I also ordered 2 strips each of the baked and grilled chicken strips, just so I  can do a little taste test and find out my preferences.  I really love the grilled chicken, it has nice flavor and was nice and juicy.  The baked chicken was good, but came in last for me when compared to its grilled and fried brethren.  About the restaurant, it is small but still perfect for accommodating patrons dropping by for a quick meal break from work or school or the modern day hunter gathers here to pick up a little something for the rest of the family units impatiently waiting at home.  It has WiFi, in case you want to surf the web/blog about your visit on your new iPad 2 while you get some nourishment.  It is located in a large strip mall, so parking should not be an issue.  Tinh and Jin's Mom + staff, runs the kitchen, while Jin mans the cash register and handles customer service, 12 hr/day, 6-days a week. Pretty tough schedule running a small restaurant, but they do a great job!  Food: 5/5 They have the techniques down when it comes to making chicken strips. Service: 5/5  There are more than one way to provide awesome service, and BFG has certainly mastered it.  I think even more established restaurants or potential restaurateurs can learn a thing or two about what great customer service is here. Location:  Close to the Rainbow exit on the 95. Parking: 5/5  The parking lot is large, it should not be a problem.",

I usually don't like white meat because it gets dry so quickly, but the guys at BFG do it right. Tender, juicy, and moist. You can even be fancy and choose 2 different sauces! Say what? yup. Give their sides a try. The veggies are yummy, and the baked mac and cheese will make you take your clothes off. Ok, not really, but you get the point.",

Ordered the 4 piece meal with garlic bread and baked mac n cheese.  Everything was delicious.  You get a lot for the price.  Baked mac n cheese is smothered in cheese with a little extra cheese added to it's cheese.  Garlic toast was fairly small but who cares when you have the mac n cheese and chicken strips.  Employees were very friendly and service was fast.  What more could you ask for?  I will definitely be stopping in here again.",

After they changed management, it didn't seem as... fun?   I ordered my usual: 4 Grilled strips, Mac and Cheese, 2 pieces of bread (you can exchange one sauce for that) and Wassabi Cream. The cashier wasn't very welcoming and the counter felt cluttered with their BUY MY EXTRA DRINKS thing... Like, they sell other drinks in bottles and such. Yeah, I like the iced tea machine they have. That's nice.  Sad to say, the chicken was dry, the food wasn't taken to us (I was spoiled before. Oops. :L) and the bread shrunk!   It was alright. I still enjoy going here every so and so. I like their food. Their mac and cheese is awesome. Wassabi cream is awesome sauce. The wall is also awesome. It's so cute. :3",

They are amazingly good and simple all at once. and for the price of 1.50 each I was super happy.  Its in a hotdog bun with lettuces and onions, a nice long piece of fried chicken and a couple slices of tomatoes covered in a sauce of your choice. A much better alternative to the hotdog. Amazingly tasty and kind of freaky that its so tasty :)",

No not the type you drink, but Jin, one of their young proprietors who can be seen greeting every guest by name (and remembering it) before during and after your meal. You can tell he truly cares about his customers and wants them to come back with a smile and an empty stomach. One of the nicest persons I can remember meeting in many many years.  Now on to the food. Baked fried or grilled. Your call. A nice way of choosing how heathly you want your strips with a bunch of exotic and traditional dipping sauces to choose from which really mix it up unlike normal chicken strip places. Also they have a chicken strip salad which looked great if your watching your figure.   Now I have 3 words for you. Panko. Bread. Crumbs. Thats right, get the fried chicken strips that come lightly breaded in panko bread crumbs and you may not want to get your chicken strips fix anywhere else. They taste so light and tasty yet not greasy if you know what I mean.   Next to it is the piping hot baked mac n cheese oozing over the foil bowl it comes in which was spot on good, sided with a small slice of their tasty garlic bread and a drink of your choice and you feel like you just went a level above fast food into a level of pure comfort food for a whole wopping $6. That's right. Who said food prices have gone up? Not for Jin and company.   Also they give little BFG chicken stickers to the kids and give out a repeat customer loyalty card as well. BFG and Jin are a win in my book.   Good luck guys, see you on my next trip in. Jason from Vegas... living in Jersey.",

    "text": "Just finished dinner from here and it was really good. Hubby got a #2 - fried chicken, fries and garlic bread and I got the #1 - grilled chicken, baked mac & cheese and garlic bread. I really liked both types of chicken so much that I can't decide which I liked better. I did really like the fact that the baked was really moist and the seasoning added some nice flavor even before the dips. I really liked the crunchy coating on the fried, like another review said it was very much like panko breadcrumbs, which was a change from a breading texture like I'm used to, but a good change.  The fries were good and not greasy but OMG that mac & cheese was AWESOME! The noodles were well cooked, not mushy, and the sauce was creamy and mild but that stringy crust of shredded cheese on top was heaven - I would go just for a serving of the mac & cheese. We tried 5 sauces: BFG, buffalo, honey mustard, wasabi cream and ranch. I really liked both the honey mustard (not too sweet or too tangy) and the wasabi cream (could probably use a little more wasabi but still good and different). The garlic bread was good nothing amazing but in no way bad. Overall I really enjoyed everything we ordered and will be adding BFG into my normal roster of take out dinners!",

All combos are under $6 and come with four nicely sized chicken strips, a side, garlic bread, two sauces AND a drink! Everything is made fresh to order which I love. I ordered the #2 because I am not dieting today:) It was Fried Strips with a generous portion of crispy fries(yum). My sauce selection was Ranch and Sweet Chili. Both were sooooo good, but I was left wanting to try all the other sauces! I did also taste the macaroni and cheese which was the perfect marriage of cheese and pasta that melted in my mouth. (Double yum) The crispy Panko crust on the chicken was a nice touch to separate them from their competitors. The way I see it, BFG is the BFD and blow the other chicken strips out the water. Lastly I must add that the personalized customer service makes me feel special and I like that. It's clean, fast, affordable and downright tasty! You will see me at BFG's again very soon to start filling up my punch card for a free meal! Delicious guys!",

Mac & cheese was bland but I loved the cheese topping. I loved the veggie kabobs and TX toast. Fries were just ok. Tried all of the different sauces and my fav was the BFG & Honey Mustard sauce.

I ordered fried strips with baked mac and cheese, honey mustard, strip sauce and ranch.   Fried strips: Now they use a panko breading or something similar. The strips have a nice crunch, but they lack flavor big time. A little salt and pepper would help. You definitely need sauce with these bad boys.  Baked mac and cheese: The best part is the cheese on top. The noodles are overcooked and under-flavored. Pass!  Honey mustard: Way too sweet and thin. It's more like a vinaigrette. It would be great in a salad, but too thin for dipping.  Ranch: Salty and probably store bought.  Strip sauce: Good attempt at trying to imitate the Cane's sauce, but not impressed. It was palatable.   Garlic toast: Sigh.. they really need to go back to the drawing board with this. It's a small slice of a baguette, soaked with butter without the slightest hint of garlic. Awful!  I paid $10, which is entirely way too much for the quality. Stick with Cane's!",

    "text": "I skipped the gym so I can eat some deep-fried chicken and since I was in the area, I decided to give Strip N Dip a try. I never went here when it was still BFG so I will not be one of those people who would complain about the dang mural of chickens on the wall. \"This place would've been 5 stars if they hadn't painted over the mural\"...seriously? Did that mural make your food taste better?  I was impressed by the super friendly service. I was surprised a chicken place had Thai tea so of course, I got that since I love Thai tea and it was pretty good. Since it was my first time, I wanted to try as many items as I can.  I went with the 6-pc combo with 1 side, garlic bread and 3 dips and added another side.  Chicken: You choose from baked (with rotisserie seasoning), fried (breaded in panko) or grilled (marinated in Asian honey glaze). I got the panko-breaded fried chicken strips. It was light and not greasy. The chicken was cooked perfectly but still juicy. 4/5  Side Dishes: They have baked mac n cheese, French fries and grilled veggies.  I went with the mac n cheese and fries. The mac n cheese was delish with the melted mozzarella on top. The fries are crispy but you have to dip them in sauce to make them tasty - eating them sans sauce is pretty blah. 4/5  Sauces: Your options are BBQ, buffalo, cheese, wasabi cream, honey mustard, ranch, sweet chili, strip sauce and teriyaki. I tried the wasabi cream, strip sauce and ranch. Ranch was a stupid choice since you can get ranch anywhere but that was my back-up plan in case I didn't like the other sauces. It was ranch. The strip sauce was similar to Cane's dipping sauce so I liked it. I didn't like the wasabi cream. You can taste wasabi the first few seconds and then sweetness takes over. I'm not going to get that again. I have about 4 sauces that I'm willing to try next time I go. But for having lots of options for sauces... 4/5",

I had not even realized the name change until we were walking up to enter! Wow they are super friendly, and I thought the lead cashier, maybe shift leader who helped us place our order was yummy!   I decided on the fried strips and mac and cheese, and Heather S. got the grilled chicken strips with mac and cheese.  The food is fresh and good. Really how can you go wrong with breading chicken and frying it, they do seem to make it just that much more delicious. I love the fried strips, the panko breading was fried to a perfect golden brown, mmmmm yum yes..  My only thing is that I think they should give up the sauce more. That is a pet peeve of mine when a joint charges for or limits \"extra\" sauce. I mean they are called strip n dip chicken right? I ordered the 6 piece chicken strip meal and ran out of sauce with there limit of 3 small dipping sauce sides.  Anyhow, it was good,  I just did not get the happy ending I had been hoping for...  This goes in my overrated file.... :(",

I usually call ahead to order for pick up or when I need to take a quick lunch. Most of the time, I get the grilled chicken with the grilled veggies, so I can be a bit on the healthier side. I love how they have their veggies -  tomatoes, onions, and cucumbers in skewers! For the sauces, I change it up every now and then since they have 9 different choices! Strip sauce, I always get though. I also tried their fried chicken strips, which are quite crispy and pretty good. The baked chicken is okay and bland, but I expected that, since well, it's just plain baked chicken... but that's why you got the variety of sauces to add some flavor - be it teriyaki or wasabi cream! Overall, a solid chicken strips place with a wide variety of choices for your  own combination of \"strip n dip\".",

    "text": "\"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\" But really though, this place is awesome. This has been on my 'to try' list for so long. I enjoyed my experience before I even tried any of the food.  Service: The cashier was very friendly. My friend and I were very indecisive because we wanted everything. We also changed our minds a couple of times an he was patient and helpful. At first I thought it was just that one cashier, but another guy was coming around and helping us out. Now, I know they just have awesome service all around!  Sauces: Yes, the sauces get their own category. We basically got all of the sauces and took a dip in each one to make sure we got the whole experience. The winners? Wasabi Cream, honey mustard, and the chili one (I forgot the name). You must get those three! You'll regret it if you don't, trust me.  Food: We got the the grilled and baked chicken strips. I enjoyed both. I feel like with the right sauces you can't go wrong with these.  Macaroni and cheese - it's like a pizza, but with macaroni! Can't go wrong with baked macaroni and cheese.  Chicken nachos! YES! It's a decent size for $4.00 It goes great with the meal if you're sharing with your friends!  The point system is also a plus. I spent $11 but since I also did the survey and whatnot I ended up with 30+ points, so I guess that's pretty cool.  Basically what I'm saying with this entire review is, TRY EVERYTHING.",

I suppose they're better than Raising Cane's (not really saying much) but that's probably because of the variety of sauces, which are also just okay, but at least they have 'em.   Service was quick (no line) and friendly. The fried chicken strips, as a specialty, was not great.   They do have one of those big red Coke machines with all the different flavors, which is nice, but skinny, thin straws: not nice.   I can't imagine ever going back, except maybe to get the veggie skewer. The chicken is just not worth the time, money, or effort.   Walt D in LV",

    "text": "Probably the best chicken fingers I've had outside a bar.   Puts PDQ to shame - and I like PDQ a lot. Makes Cane's seem even more inedible than usual.   Nice light crispy crust, chicken had a quality taste and texture. At some restaurants you get gamey or tough chicken strips, or worst of all tendons, or enough crust to seem like some kind of 2 year old savory donut. Not at all the case with these. Delicious and tender are all you find here.   I had a 6 strip meal delivered by Uber Eats. I hadn't eaten all day so the loaded fries won me over as an upgrade. I got wasabi cream, ranch, and strip sauce as my dips. And a Thai iced coffee.   The chicken strips have won me over. Done.   The loaded fries were okay...I'm glad I got them...they were actually really tasty. I don't know where I'm going with this. They reminded me of \"carne asada fries\" but easier to consume and brighter in flavor.   The dips were mixed. The ranch is underwhelming but not bad. The strip sauce is unique - pretty much what you'd expect from the genre, creamy, tangy, and a little strange. The wasabi cream though...new favorite dip of all time. Unabashedly in love with it.   Lastly. The Thai iced coffee. Not my favorite. I've never had Thai iced coffee...but I'm familiar with the concept, and an unapologetic coffee nerd. I was expecting a more unique spice flavor, but it mostly tasted like oxidized coffee concentrate with a little more sugar than i would normally use to make coffee from a continental breakfast drinkable. Maybe this is just me not liking this preparation method. Maybe it's not very good. Who could say.   Anyway...aside from the coffee being mediocre...the food is incredibly good, and I've already determined I'll be a return customer, and probably sooner than later. Very highly recommended based on my first experience.",

Very juicy, Panko crusted that gives it the perfect amount of crunch & numerous sauces to dip! My fave sauce  pairings are the BFG (tastes like buffalo & ranch mix with a tang), classic Buffalo & BBQ! Excellent customer service! I will definitely be back soon & can't wait for the expansion of more locations! Definitely a hidden gem in Vegas! (I ate my whole meal before I got to take a pic )",

    "text": "Very simple yet diverse menu. They have three different ways they cook their chicken and they all taste great. No matter which way you get it, its healthy eating. They have grilled vegetables to go with your grilled or baked chicken which by the way is 100% real chicken, white meat at that. They have several different sauces and depending on what count of strips you order, you'll get your choice of either two or three sauces.   The customer service is what it should be anywhere you go. The food is great and the price is right, but I keep coming back because the owner makes it a point to know your name and if you're a first-timer, he'll ask if you'd like to have your picture taken and posted on social media, usually FB. The owner is a local kid in his mid-twenties and a graduate of UNLV who seems to have a passion for quality and not quantity.   He seems to be on point with staff selection because his staff is a reflection of him. They recenly expanded their menu to include deserts and other items. They have a very wide variety of soft drinks and healthy drinks. They have a reward program that they recently kicked off but I haven't had it long enough to give a review on it.   The establishment is always clean including the bathroom and the decor is appropriate. This is place you have to try at least once. The only reason I'm giving it 4 out of 5 (I'd give it 4.5 if it was possible) is because of the fact that the place is small. The bathroom is basically right in the middle of the place right off the dining area, which is probably why they maintain it so clean. I don't think the owner anticipated the popularity the place would gain but if things keep going the way they are they will need a bigger place.",

Stick with the Sweet Chili or Wasabi Cream dipping sauces...their Ranch and BFG sauces were outright awful.  The sides and bread were average at best, including the Mac & Cheese other reviewers raved about.  Bottom line...they ain't got nothing on Raising Cane's!  Service on my visit was definitely sub-par.  The boss (the only guy not in uniform) was very preoccupied giving freebies to a scragly looking biker customer and his two little miracles...a big, bald Ginger complete with ZZ Top beard, a black \"Vatos Locos\" t-shirt and unkept Ruger P-85 semi-auto strapped to his side.  Further, the cashier was perturbed that I would not forfeit my phone number for text specials.  Since I wasn't impressed and don't like possibly being caught in crossfire, I won't be back.",

Service was also a little quicker than before. Cool soda machine.  Only downfall is that their prices have changed and are a little more expensive for the same food...

    "text": "I first visited this restaurant back in 2011 (as BFG) when Yelpers all over Vegas were fawning over it.   Not only was the food raved about but everyone seemed amazed at how well the owner at the time could remember names to faces and naturally I wanted to test it out.   True story: the 2nd time I went back he had no idea who I was.   Nice parlor trick!   The fact that it's extremely close to my work didn't hurt either.   As of a few weeks ago I visited it again for the 4th time (the 2nd time under the new monikor).   I feel like that fact pretty much exemplifies how I feel about about it.   If I hated it, I probably would have never returned.   If I loved it, I'd probably have been 15-20 times at least.   Yelp math!   In those 4 visits I have tried all 3 variations of their signature chicken strips, and the grilled veggies, mac and cheese, and fries for sides.     Grilled:  This is what I was most excited about.   Every so and so months I decide that I need to stop gorging myself on red meat and carbs as I usually do, so reading about tasty grilled chicken strips accompanied by grilled veggies made my deep deep inner skinny person rejoice.   Unfortunately I was pretty underwhelmed both times I tried them.   The chicken and the veggies both just tasted very bland to me.   Maybe every delicious fried chicken finger I've had from Raising Cane's and other establishments has tainted my taste buds.  Baked:  Tried this for the first time a few weeks back.   Better than the grilled for sure due to the seasoning, but not anything that has me craving a return visit.  With this order I had the fries, which I did enjoy quite a bit.   But I mean, they're FRIES.   Hot, crispy and well seasoned though.     Fried:  The best of the three, but to reiterate the point: it's fried chicken, of course it's good.  The panko breading definitely make it unique to most other versions you can find elsewhere, but not necessarily better tastewise.   And to make an unhealthy choice worse I got the mac and cheese with it the one time I tried it.   A good version for sure, but it didn't exactly set itself apart from most other mac and cheeses that I've had.  The stars of the show here are the dipping sauces.   The wide variety of them provide for a lot of different tasting experiences and most of the ones I tried were extremely tasty.   My favorites are the sweet chili and wasabi cream, and in particular I liked combining those two for a sweet/spicy combo.   You can be like Bill Nye the Science Guy and experiment on your own combinations.  Bring the kids, they'll have a blast.  So overall it's good food, and the price isn't too bad, but it doesn't exactly light my world on fire either.   See you in 8 months or so Strip N Dip!",

All of the sides are delicious, but I recommend the mac & cheese or french fries.  They have a rewards system and will ask you for your phone number.

For6 dollars you get chicken (BFG, which is what I will always call this place) , garlic bread, a side, and 2 delicious sauces. The honey mustard and strip sauce, ahem, I mean BFG sauce are the best IMO. The mac and cheese is also pretty good. As long as it isn't busy you get your food super fast.   The random special items have all been pretty good when I got them- nachos, hot dog thing, funnel cake- whats not to love?

I saw a fellow yelper check in here so I decided to give the place a go. The location is a bit small but the staff were very friendly and asked if we had been there before and broke down the menu. I ordered the fried chicken strips and mac n cheese and he ordered the baked with fried. We each picked our 3 sauces that came with the combo. The Guy taking the order let us know which ones were homemade and which were not. We didn't have to wait too long for our food, and upon getting it the hubby and I did what we do swap pieces so we can both enjoy both baked and fried. Both the baked and fried were cooked and seasoned perfectly! The mac-n-cheese complete my LIFE let me tell you I could go there for just that alone! It was creamy and gooey at the same time and the noodles were cooked just right. The guy who brought out our food was so nice he even told us since it was our first time if there was a sauce we didn't like he would swap it out for us. We selected sweet chili, wasabi cream, ranch, honey mustard, buffalo and BFG and none of them were a disappointment, the food also came with garlic bread that was delicious as well. This place gets tops stars because from start to finish it was plesant dinning experience.",

The sides are good but we felt the veggies were mostly filler like onion and not enough other veggies. Kids liked the Mac and cheese and the fries were seasoned well.

It might be a simple restaurant but Matt & the other girl working were super friendly and highly accommodating to us and the other guests that came and went while we were there.

I had read the great reviews of Yelp friends when the restaurant had its former name but somehow I never stopped here.  That changes from now on!  We ordered two four strip dinners with chicken strips fried.  We each got French fries as our side and two ranch sauces, a wasabi, and a cheese sauce.  Within a short time, we were brought our dinners that were served in a to go box for convenience and to take with you if you don't finish.  The chicken strips were great!  The French fries were quite good.  I didn't think the garlic bread had much garlic taste but I may be too jaded by overuse of garlic.  My wife really liked the ranch sauce and the wasabi was my favorite.  For dessert, we split a chocolate funnel cake.  Everything about our visit was really good.  The staff was super friendly, the prices are reasonable, and although it's a really small space we enjoyed dining in.  Thanks to Stefany V for her great directions to the store.  I'll be back and I'll get takeout.  There's another day ending in Y on the horizon!",

They also have a chicken sandwich and nachos, but I always stick with the strips. Sides consist of baked mac and cheese, fries or grilled veggies. They have combos where you can get 2,4, or 6 strips with a side, garlic bread and sauce. The fried strips are breaded in panko and then fried to perfection. They have some yummy sauces too- the wasabi cream is unique and delicious as well as the honey mustard. The food is nothing spectacular though, it's just okay and I have had better.  My complaint is the owner/manager named Nick. He is really friendly but he is ALWAYS multitasking. While this is not a bad thing, he does it in the middle of helping people. So you will walk up to the counter and he's like \"HEY how are ya, what can I get you?\"  And then you go \"I'll have a....\" and then he's gone off delivering food to a table. Or cleaning up baskets. Or wiping down tables. And you're like wtf just happened? He always apologizes about it, but it's totally not cool to be in the middle of taking an order and then just leave. And I've seen him do it multiple times, not just to me either.  1. If you need to excuse yourself, say EXCUSE ME. And 2. If you are that short staffed hire another person!",

    "text": "Just had lunch here for the first time with my husband. Simple place, simple menu! I love how they have choices of grilled, fried or baked chicken. My husband got the 6 piece combo which comes with one side, three sauces, and a garlic bread. He chose Mac n cheese, honey mustard, ranch, & the house strip sauce. I got the chicken nachos & we also got an extra side order of fries and a drink.  Everything came out fresh & hot. The 6 pc meal was super huge! And my chicken nachos were the perfect portion. The mac n cheese was pretty good, but nothing better than the average. The chicken pieces were a good size & crunchy because of the panko breading. The fries were just your average. My nachos were really good, they are very generous in they're chicken & it had a lot of flavor. We really enjoyed the strip sauce! Next time will try to buffalo. They also have the Coke machines that are super fancy & have multiple drinks in them.  Good place for a good price. I just wish they offered the drink with the meal instead of a separate charge, lol. But that's a personal preference. Definitely will come back!",

Jin is a great guy, he cares about his customers, always polite and friendly to everyone.  He takes his time to talk to his customers and make conversations with them.  I've had pretty much everything on the menu and the sauces are just perfect with the chicken strips.    The prices are reasonable and food is great and will continue to go back to BFG for Chicken strips.  I've tried so far the lunch special which is the chicken nachos and they were very tasty.  I still have yet to try their other weekly specials.  Keep up the good work BFG.",

Since it was our first time eating there he offered to give us some  complimentary grilled chicken strips so we could try them since we had  ordered the fried ones.  After tasting we decided to order more and we also ordered the chicken nachos which were delicious too.  The place is very clean a little small though but that was not an issue since there wasn't many people when we went.  The portions are good. The mac and cheese is very good and fresh too. They are super nice and friendly and they care about their customers. I have to admit though we did feel a little out of place at first because their customers are mostly very young hip crowd. But We will definitely go back because they have good food at a good price.  We are soo glad we tried this place.",

I ordered the baked AND grilled chicken strips (had to quality control them both), and I was pleasantly surprised by their flavor minus the delicious sauce options.    A diverse selection of sauce options, veggies or carb-filled sides (mac & cheese, fries..) and garlic bread come with every order.

Now if you been to typical catered events, they are overpriced with extremely limited selections for food. You know what I'm talking about, sandwiches with limited selections, or the pizza that someone had to order pineapples... WHY???   I digress. We had ordered all the different chicken strips (Baked, Fried, and Grilled) and all of them came out just like the restaurant. The Fried strips were delicious and still crispy even after 30-45 minutes.   We got sides of Mac' N Cheese and veggies on the side and wow, I thought I was in the store.   I highly recommend this place to cater your next event. But if you really feel like cold pineapple pizza, I guess that works too, but remember some of your guests will be griping.",

I stick with the fried strips with fries. I get ranch for the fries and then wasabi cream and sweet chili for the strips. (dip in the cream then the chili, fantastic!)  I've tried the mac and cheese and also the vegetables. They were good, but nothing for ME to write home about (I know a lot of people love them!). I also tried the grilled chicken, which was good.   There's just something super special about their fried strips. Love them.   And the fries are pretty darn tasty, too. I am picky about fries - and I love these.   I would say, though, if you take it to go, crack the box open when you get in the car - the fries do not really travel too well with the condensation in the boxes - learned that the hard way, couldn't eat them. I was so bummed out.",

    "text": "I was so excited to try out BFG (now Strip N Dip), since I've been seeing the excellent reviews pop up on Yelp for a few months now. *sigh* I didn't like it, and man I wanted to like it. I got the baked chicken (it was just kinda wet and slimy and the flavor didn't wow me at all), mac and cheese (mostly bubbly cheese, which tasted alright but too much for my guts), garlic bread (overwhelmingly garlic-y), honey mustard (not the best but also alright), and sweet chili (blech).   I am NOT a picky eater, but this was just a bummer. Maybe the fried strips are better? Maybe I should have tried the wasabi sauce people rave about? I don't know... Money is tight these days, so if I'm going out for lunch it better be good. I won't be rushing back for sure.  The best things about the place? Fanta in bottles (which I noticed AFTER I ordered) and the very friendly service. They have that down to a science!",

    "text": "Simple is best!  You get chicken strips and either choose how you want it made:  Baked, Fried, or Grilled (BFG)!  I prefer either baked or grilled!  Fried is yummy tooooo!  And if you go to the gym down the street I heavily recommend BFG's baked or grilled chicken strips pre or post workout!  If you want to something completely healthy then come here (minus the bread).   The skewered veggies (that must take a while to put together) is made perfectly.    Because of a recent intern-yelp-event I was able to sample all of the sauces that you get to choose with your chicken strips.  My favorite is the wasabi and sweet chili!  With the buffalo and bfg coming in 3rd and 4th.  The reason this place is bumped up to 5 stars is because of Jin and his family that run the place!  Jin is usually seen in the front counter and is really personable and remembers every customer who has ever been there!  If you go I would recommend you put the chicken hat on and take a picture with Jin!    I do hate the fact that I might be an addict to BFG chicken strips, the store closes around 8 and I'm one of the many that rushes within the last hour to grab me some grub!   Definitely give this spot a try, it's located left of the Home Depot and right of the comic book store.",

Experience OverviewService: 10 - friendly and attentiveAtmosphere: 10 - cozy and clean And most important Food: 10 - Win! Delicious with chicken strips grilled, fried, with sides of Mac n Cheese, veggies, and sauces of all kinds. Personal favorite:Dipping grilled chicken in teriyaki or their signature Strip sauce.

    "text": "What a gem this place is! I wish there was a location in the southwest side of town, because I would go there everyday. I like to compare this place to In-N-out..... not that it is the same type of food, but it is similar in simplicity! They only have a few items on their menu (like in-n-out). It's just genius. I hate going to places that have a billion items on their menu and it takes me forever to look over everything and then the food is blah. This chicken strip place is awesome!   Get your chicken strips either Baked, Fried, or Grilled! Simple as that!  And the fried strips are coated in panko crumbs, which makes it taste better then regular battered fried chicken.   Their frys are as expected.....BUT the baked Mac-N-Cheese is what makes it. It comes in a round tin container, which doesn't seem like a lot, but it is plenty. It has this layer of cheese on top that is slightly burnt, not the gross burnt, but that slight cheese burnt. If you are a cheese lover, there is no denying this place's Mac-N-Cheese!   It is also family owned which I love to support in this town!   Lastly, their prices are reasonable, on the cheaper side. Its great that this place is in business. I hope they do well and open up more locations!",

    "text": "Finally, I received some tender loving! I have been wanting to come to BFG for the longest time. For those of you who aren't hip enough to know what BFG stands for, it means Baked, Fried or Grilled. You have the choice of choosing either of those three options. Upon walking in, I noticed that this placed had to be good because it was packed the whole time I was there. I ordered the 6 finger meal, which comes garlic bread, your choice of side (macaroni and cheese, fries or grilled veggies) and your choice of three sauces, too many to name right now. I got fried chicken tenders, mac n cheese and my sauces were ranch, BFG and the yasabi sauce.  The wait for the meal was not long at all, before I even expected it I was already greeted with a tray of my delicious foods. It's kind of hard to ruin chicken tenders, but there was something about these tenders that blew me away. They were delicious and cooked to perfection. The panko breading was a perfect compliment to the succulent chicken that was surprisingly juicy. Although I got fried, I will go back and try those baked tenders because I looked at a strangers plate and they looked freaking delicious. I got 6 tenders and I could only eat 4 of them, they are sized just right and not too small or too large.  I was super excited to try the macaroni and cheese and that was, admittedly, the first thing that I ended up trying. The M&C was baked in this generous tin and my gosh. Something so simple tasted so great. It had this layer of cheese baked right on top and I didn't want it to end, but my stomach did and I got super full really quick. But it was amazing.  The sauces were great, ranch was ranch. The BFG sauce tasted something like Thousand Island but I LOVED the Yasabi sauce. It wasn't spicy or anything, but it just tasted great. I loved it and kind of gave it all my love with my tenders.   I'd recommend this place to anyone and I'm glad I was able to visit one of my Yelp bookmarks after numerous failed attempts to go. If you go, let me know cause I am down!",

    "text": "The Skinny: great fried and grilled chicken with awesome unique dipping sauces with some so-so sides(4) Service: even though it's counter service, you get the warm and fuzzies when the owner makes it a point to get to know you (5) Value: a great plate of food (plus fountain drink) for only $5.75 plus get your 10th combo plate for free? - bring it on!(5)  Planted in a rather large strip mall, this place is rather inconspicious. Situated next to the Home Depot, there were plenty of people even at 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon waiting for their plate of fried goodness.  And what a plate of battered deliciousness it is!  Combo meals ($5.75 each) are easy. Choose your style of chicken (baked, fried or grilled) and your side (grilled veggies, salad, mac 'n cheese, french fries). Each meal comes with two house-made dipping sauces, a drink and garlic bread. We ordered two combo meals - 1 plate of fried chicken with a side of mac 'n cheese, 1 plate of grilled chicken on a bed of salad  and tried 4 different sauces. We also returned for a second run to try their fries and 3 other sauces (neither my hubs or I like Ranch).  The grilled chicken was wonderfully succulent, and had a nice flavour and texture - very similar to Korean barbeque. Fried chicken had a perfect consistency - tender and juicy on the inside with a lovely golden crispy panko crust on the outside without being too greasy. It had a perfect ratio of coating to meat and completely satisfied our cravings.  The other attraction is the interesting combination of sauces they offered. We tried teriyaki, BFG sauce, buffalo, honey mustard, wasabi cream, sweet thai chili, and bbq sauces. Our favs: the honey mustard had a bit of a nice hint of heat to it( as mustard should) while the sweet thai chili offered a lovely combination of spice and sweetness. My hubby, who loves wasabi, adored the creamy concoction.  The reason for the 4 stars is probably the sides. While the salad was wonderful (the veggies were incredibly fresh) and the fries were great, the baked mac 'n cheese was only okay. The cheese sauce, perhaps little too generic tasting for us, but it's prepared well with ample amounts of cheese topping and perfectly cooked macaroni. Definitely comfort food. The garlic bread was flavourful but lack the density of a nice slice of bread.  These are really minor quibbles and I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some good eats at a fantastic price. The variety of the menu really makes this place a crowd pleaser especially with the healthier options. This place definitely gives other casual dining places (ahem! the Golden Arches) a run for its money.  Finally, the staff made a point to get to know you and make sure you have a good experience. They are more than helpful with making sure you have everything you need (utensils, drinks - you name it). This place has the makings of a great neighbourhood joint and I can't wait to come back here again!",

First of all the strips are a little small. Too much breading and not enough flavor. The sauces however are great, I will say that. I think that buffalo sauce was excellent.  For the sides, I just found most of them to be lacking in flavor. Mac and cheese as well as the veggies the same. Not my cup of tea I guess, and I just find Caine's to be a superior product to this place. This is not a chain however and I would not want to discourage people from coming in and giving them a try. That plaza is not full of great food, so go for it, give them a shot if you are hungry and in that area.",

Their menu is simple and limited, but you can't go wrong with anything there. You can choose your chicken strips to be baked, fried, or grilled, hence the name BFG. You also get to choose 2 sauces for your strips. I liked my grilled chicken with teriyaki sauce and the fried strips with their wasabi cream sauce. For the sides, the baked mac n cheese is to die for (sooo cheesy), and their shoe-string fries are really crispy and tasty as well. If you want to go healthy, choose the grilled veggies.

Now for the condiments: definitely get the honey mustard. It's amazing. I was, however, super disappointed in their ranch dressing. Half of what makes a good chicken strip amazing is the ranch dressing, and this ranch dressing leaves quite a bit to be desired in my opinion. Definitely need to find a new recipe/supplier.

The prices are low and the quality is way up there.  I also tried the chicken  strips and was pleased with the crispy,  crunchy coating .  Even the honey mustard dipping sauce was something worth writing home about.  Bottom line : I am sold and will be back.  Nice job!",

I love all things chicken -most of the time, ALL the time!- While driving through this part of Vegas, I was surprised to see a Raising Cane's close by! But in all honesty, let's get one thing straight. You cannot compare the two. I mean, you can but they aren't the same animal. SND has more options for sure... And they both have crispy chicken that relies on their sauces for overall flavor. So, there you have it. Just my two cents.  What I enjoyed: -Crispy panko crust. Hot and juicy. Practically burned my tongue off.  -They are never frozen, meaning it's fresh. -I like having options. Want to be a tad bit more healthy? Order it grilled. Maybe baked. -Grilled veggies? Yup! We had a vegan and vegetarian in our party so they liked that! -Staff. So friendly! They even took an Instagram photo of our party.  What was okay: -I thought the Mac & Cheese was on the runny side. So sue me! I loved the cheesy meltyness on top, but I didn't like cracking open the inside. -The sauces. Not terrible. Might give the wasabi cream a try next time!",

    "text": "Tucked into a blink-and-you'll-miss-it nook on the edge of a shopping plaza between a Ross and the Home Depot, this specialty chicken place has a few surprises in store.  Service is top-notch: we were immediately greeted, walked through the menu, invited to join their loyalty program, and made to feel that our business was appreciated. Our food was brought out, we were checked on throughout our visit, and given a goodbye as we walked out the door- all with a smile by the gentleman behind the counter.  As for the food: BF got a 6 piece fried with a side of mac, I opted for the 4 piece rotisserie with a side of veggies, and we added on a hot chick and a thai tea- the latter mostly because since when have I ever been able to get chicken strips and thai tea in the same place? Bizarre but lovely. The drink was out right away and just a smidge less sweet than I am used to. $2 cup is well-priced.  The chicken arrived hot and tasty: BF surprisingly preferred the grilled while I preferred the panko breading for the fried version. We tried several different sauces including the ranch (nothing interesting), wasabi (nice with just a little kick), honeymustard (light but not my thing), strip sauce (my favorite), and buffalo (my second favorite, dude's preferred dip). BF put it well: he'd come back for the grilled strips tossed in buffalo sauce, but the rest of the menu seemed too similar to Raisin' Cane's for his liking, and he's a huge fan of theirs.  As for the sides: the mac was super indulgent and better than the mac I've had at more formal or high-end places. Loved that the dish was still gooey and cheesy instead of dried out, which I run into a lot at places that call themselves \"southern\" or boast about being \"homestyle\". Dude, if I made this mac at home, I'd never leave... because I'd weigh 500 pounds. It's good, but definitely only get if you went to the gym that day, there's a lot of guilt involved with that much pasta and cheese. The grilled veggies were a surprise hit with BF, he'd tack those on to his future grilled-with-buffalo purchase.  Lastly, the hot chick was oddly again one of my favorite things: a simple fried strip doused in buffalo sauce (sensing a theme?) and placed in a small bun with lettuce and tomato, it's simple and it's delicious. There's  meal option for two of those with a side, and I'd likely consider it in the future.  Final note about their loyalty program: tracks your purchase spendings by the dollar, when you reach a $60 total you get a free meal. I didn't ask for more details but I do like that it tracks with your phone number rather than yet another pesky key tag or card to keep track of.",

    "text": "This place is pretty easy to miss especially since it's a small building and it's located in such a big plaza. Strip n Dip is located right next to Home Depot.   Came here for lunch. They had combos with six, four or two chicken strips. It comes with your choice of one side. Drinks NOT included. Customer service was great. I told the cashier this was my first time here and he explained the menu to me and a little bit about how Strip n Dip came to establishment.  I ordered the \"kids meal\" with 2 baked chicken strips (choose between: fried, baked or grilled) and I chose the infamous mac n cheese that other Yelpers raved about as my side. You also get your choice of one dipping sauce. The buffalo sauce was yummy. Total cost was $4.79 I also ordered a 20 oz. iced thai coffee for $1.99. Two dollars for iced coffee!?! Sure...don't mind if I do. The coffee was pretty good too. They also had thai iced tea too. Hmmm...interesting...I would NEVER imagine they would have thai drinks at a chicken strip place.   This would be a perfect lunch size for all you small/light eaters. The two chicken strips were kinda on the small side but with the mac n cheese...it filled me up perfectly. (don't want to over-indulge here). I'm not a fan of mac n cheese but this.....THIS was DELICIOUS!!! The baked cheese they added on top really made this stand out from your typical boring mac n cheese. The mac n cheese alone was enough to make this review a four star rating.   So...the reason why I can't give this a full 5 stars is because of some \"rounding fee\" they do on our transaction. I wasn't even aware until a fellow Yelper told me about it. I checked my receipt and it said \"due rounding: $0.01.\" Yes, yes I know...it's only 1 cent. But still...what's up with this!?! I've NEVER, EVER seen this before in my life. Literally.   But even with this \"due rounding\" fee, would I be back?? Of course I would. Whenever I'm craving for some chicken strips..I'll swing by here. Next time, if I have a bigger appetite, I would order 4 strips and I would like to try the fries.",

I had their Mac and Cheese,it was very tasty, but the Blackened chicken strips with veggies were not as good as the Mac and cheese. They were not well seasoned I think.

The mac n cheese was phenomenal and super duper cheesy. Just how I like it. They have an incredible sauces too! My favorite was the wasabi cream. So perfect!  The food was incredible, so was the service and on top of all that the prices were beyond reasonable for the quality and quantity that you get. Winner winner, chicken dinner!

They have great customer service: the one guy working was super friendly and welcoming. He even opened the door for us!   The food is legit for how much it is, but it ain't perfect. you can get chicken baked, fried, or grilled & choose between a variety of different sauces. I recommend their strip sauce :) Don't get the BBQ sauce, it's a little odd tasting! Then I also ordered Thai Tea because I was excited to taste a cheaper cup of my favorite tea and it was pretty good!!   Also, the Choco funnel cake is good, but they put a little too much powdered sugar! ;) so break into your wallet a bit and have fun eating!!",

Ordered the weekly special at the time, which was Chicken Nachos without the refried beans and BF had the Fried Combo. Both were fantastic! The chicken strips were moist and not covered in flour like most chicken strips I have tried. And the fries were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside and had a slight flavor to it. Got the ranch and honey mustard dips. The honey mustard dip was fantastic with the chicken as well as the fries. The Chicken Nachos should remain on the menu as they were just...that good! The chicken had seasoning and the pico de gallo went well with it...The only complaint I have is I wish there was more nacho cheese as I love nacho cheese.  Would definately come back when I am in Vegas!",

Now it's more like $10 or $11. The quality of the food is still good. Be sure to try the Mac and cheese. I'm not big on the name change either. It used to be BFG chicken which stood for Baked Fried Grilled. Strip and dip not the image I always have for dining",

My friend and I decided to grab lunch together right after school and we were both craving for fried chicken (LOL professor was talking bout fried chicken in class) And we decided to try this place out.  We came here in lunch hours and the place was pretty packed. But we managed to score a table inside the restaurant. We ordered both the baked and the fried chicken combo and honestly I liked both of them. They had a variety of dipping sauce to choose from and I liked the honey mustard (my all time favorite!!!!!) and wasabi.  Not to mention about the good service in here, jin is super attentive and okay now time runs short, the last thing I wanna say is  you gotta go and try this place out lol",

    "text": "I had to see what the hype was about these chicken strips.  My friend and I stopped here on the way to the outlets.  It's a pretty small place with a few tables, but it wasn't very busy when we arrived.  I ordered four individual strips so we could try all of them, while she ordered the grilled strips meal with a side of mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese was really good!  The cheese on top was baked well, and the cheese inside was very creamy.  It's probably fake cheese, but I like fake cheese.  The strips themselves were very moist but a little small.  We tried the bakes, fried, and grilled strips.  My favorite was, of course, the fried.  The batter was light and crisp - I think someone said the breading is panko?  We got two sauce, the Chili Thai and the BFG sauce, which is similar to Thousand Island.  The Chili Thai sauce was dark brown rather than red and had a kick to it, but it was good.  I liked it more than the BFG sauce.  However, I do think that the sauce at Raisin' Cane's is the best.  We also ordered the Thai Ice Coffee.  My friend really liked it bc it wasn't very sweet, whereas I had to put more sugar in mine.  Thai Iced Coffee is  usually pretty sweet, but this one wasn't.  Overall, it was a good meal for under $7, though if you're hungry, you better order a bunch of strips!",

    "text": "My new fave American food in town. My hubby and I like to search yelp and see what is a 4 1/2 to 5 star place and try it. No matter how far it is. That's what brought us from Henderson to Rainbow and 95.   We were greeted by a friendly person who ended up being one of the owners, Matt. I noticed right away that he really did have a passion for what he does. I think that the most successful people differ from the others because of their passion. With his help, we ordered the family meal which more than fed me, hubby, syd, cam, and luke. And might I add that we are all big eaters and all have active Yelp profiles detailing our eating escapades (except for luke, he's 3). First, the baked mac n cheese was a revelation. I can make some good stuff, but this one closely rivals my own personal recipe. It's sooo delish. The fries and the veggies were stellar. The chicken comes in 3 styles: baked with rotisserrie season, fried with panko, and grilled with asian marinade. My hubby asked which I liked the best and I couldn't even choose.   They are embarking on a catering biz, too. We have committed to Matt to use him for the whole next year of kid birthday parties. This is the perfect food for a crowd, or to drop into for a quick lunch.   They are located next to Home Depot on the garden side. I would recommend them to anyone that likes homestyle food that's hot and fresh.",

I highly recommend the wasabi cream sauce as well as the sweet chili sauce.  This place is a great example of having a great product with great service.  Over the past 5 days I've been here 3 times and both the food and the service are consistently awesome. I'm sure Jin knows how this combination of great food and great service contributes to his business.  Although Jin first told me to close my eyes and the chicken strips would taste like passionfruit, marshmallows and masago, I was pleasantly surprised how good it all was.  The fried chicken strips are crispy and juicy and cooked to order and the baked mac & cheese is really creamy and delicious.    BFG Chicken Strips may be a little hard to find as there is no street signage but it definitely worth looking for!  It's just south of the Home Depot on Rainbow between Alta and Charleston.  Drop in and say \"Hi!\".",

The coating is not the same as the other place but the quality and taste were just as good. When I got home and the family sampled the strips they decided they reminded them of katsu chicken. The coating is light and crunchy. The chicken is juicy and flavorful. I will definitely be back to try the grilled chicken and grilled vegetables.",

    "text": "Awesome.  Highly affordable awesome value and taste!  This place was one of the biggest surprises on our recent Vegas trip.  We had seen the high ratings on Yelp prior to our visit so the wife and I had to make a stop and I'm glad to report that we can't help but concur with all the positive praise for this place.  Chicken strips...what more can I say.  You can get them Baked, Fried, or Grilled.  We both decided to build our own combos and seeing as how we were on vacation and not worried about being healthy, we opted for the fried strips with baked mac & cheese and garlic bread.  The strips were crispy but not heavy like something you'd get from Popeye's or KFC.  The breading is definitely more panko crisp than buttermilk batter crunchy.  Delicious and moist.  The baked mac & cheese was awesome as well.  Very hot when it shows up at your table but once you're able to dig in, cheesey explosion and tender macaroni are headed your way.  I like how the macaroni noodles themselves were tender without being mushy like KFC's.  The garlic bread was a nice finishing touch and not something you'd typically expect from a more fast food-esque establishment.  You get your choice of 2 dipping sauces and we chose BBQ, Sweet Chili, Buffalo, and Wasabi Cream.  Two words: WASABI CREAM.  Perfect.  You get a slightly spicy wasabi flavor without being over-powering and the creamy texture helps smooth it out.  The food was so good that we stuck around and added an order of fries which were perfect as well.  Golden, crispy, and lightly battered.  The service was awesome and the staff super friendly.  The guy who took our order was very nice and engaging and was making sure to check up on us as well as the other patrons which is refreshing to see in a small establishment.  I'm happy to say that we will definitely be making this a regular stop.  At about $12 to feed 2 people with awesome food, how could we not?!",

I had the ranch and the honey mustard but my friend ordered the wasabi cream. Man, was the wasabi cream the bomb-diggity.  I ordered the standard fried chicken strips with Mac-and-cheese and a small piece of garlic toast. I'm usually not big on mac-and-cheese but theirs was so so tasty. I know it's bad for you but it was oooh sooo good for the soul. The owner is very friendly and walks around and takes the time to make sure that everything meets with your approval and also satisfies the taste buds. They have different specials of the week and this week it happened to be the chicken nachos. Wish I could have sampled that but I will definitely do that on my next business trip to Las Vegas.

I've been wanting to try this place for... a really long time, but alas, I live in Henderson so I wasn't about to make a trek out for some chicken strips. Luckily, it's close to Jen's place, as in, spitting distance, so we checked it out. Let's just say my expectations were through the roof. I found out the nachos weren't available for another two weeks because this week is the hot chick week. *tears!*  I got the #1: Baked Chicken Strips: Just okay. Lacked flavor. 2/5 Mac & Cheese: Pretty tasty. I liked the melted cheese on top. 3/5 Garlic Bread: You can't mess up garlic bread. 5/5 Wasabi Cream Sauce: Flavorful, yet not overpowering. 3/5 Sweet Chili Sauce: Definitely the best - not Mae Ploy sauce, pleasant sweet taste with a hint of onion flavor. 5/5 Soda water: Heck yeah, I love it when that's offered. 5/5  Jen got the ?: Fried Chicken Strips: I only tried a bite. I'd say they're 3.5/5 French fries: 4/5 Buffalo Sauce: Tastes exactly like Louisiana Hot Sauce + Butter that's been mixed together and cooled so it's creamy. My family makes this all the time so it's nothing that knocked my socks off because I'm so familiar with it. 3/5. Honey Mustard Sauce: Decent. 3/5 Mix of different drinks: I'm not going to try that. Ew!  Jin was pretty pimp. He was cool and talked to us a bunch while we ate and was a good sport for taking Jen's \"attitude\" humor. (She's from Jersey, need I explain more?) The service was awesome, other businesses should take heed, but I definitely want to try the grilled chicken strips and nachos before I throw down a 4 star rating.",

You know what taste better than these chicken strips, EVERY OTHER CHICKEN STRIP YOU HAVE EVER TASTED.  Honestly, the chicken tenders I ate here were terrible. They are of frozen bag variety, just like the ones you get in the grocery store freezer, which is probably why they all look the same. The tenders were unreasonably bland, not even that used-chicken grease taste. I got a side of Mac n Cheese and, that too, lack any flavor whatsoever. The Mac n Cheese is actually Identical in look and taste to KFC.   Whats funny to me is all these reviews that talk about the atmosphere. PEOPLE (shills), this place is no bigger than a gas station mini-mart, and it smells like fried food. It sits on a corner  next to a Home Depot filled with day-laborers. WTF is so appealing and \"cozy\" about that?  I really do not understand the good about this place, but do not let the CSN hipsters and \"cool\" kids fool you.",

The places before BFG were complete failures, so it's actually nice to see this place do so well.  The menu is extremely simple and effective, so it won't take you more than a few minutes to decide what you want.  Food is BOMB! And their weekly specials are also delicious. I'm particularly in love with the \"Chicken Nachos\", best nachos I have ever had. I usually get a number #2 and substitute the fries with the grilled veggies.  Service is some of the best from a place like this, thanks Jin & Tin! Prices are beyond reasonable. This place is just awesome!  BFG Chicken Strips is so awesome I vow never to give it up, never let it down, never turn around and desert it. Never going to say good bye and never going to tell a lie...",

We ordered teriyaki, buffalo, honey mustard, and BFG sauce. My favorite was the honey mustard and BFG for the fried chicken and teriyaki for the grilled. The fried chicken is breaded and fried like fish and chips, it was really good, the mac n cheese seemed like Krafts with cheese on top and baked.. It was really good that way. Fries were awesome, found myself dipping them in the BFG sauce a lot! The garlic bread is not Texas toast so just expect French roll style garlic bread. I love Cane's chicken too what makes this stand out is the choices. I think I'll try the nachos next go around.",

I would have to agree with Tien, the staff is what really elevates this small, mom and pop restaurant to 4 stars.  The staff is very friendly and really tries to engage you conversation.  They are also constantly checking on you while you are waiting and eating.  Making sure you have utensils, napkins, enough to drink, etc.  They will happily refill your drink for free if you are running low.  The food is also pretty good.  I opted for the fried chicken vs the grilled or baked.  And I chose the grilled vegies, which a nice healthier side order option.  The fried chicken fingers were panko breaded so it was very crunchy, but not oily.  I picked the BFG and wasabi sauce.  The BFG sauce is best described as a sour thousand island dressing.  The wasabi was mild, but definitely identifiable.  The wasabi was a good choice for the chicken, while the BFG was better on the vegies.  My only gripe with this place is they do not allow you to mix and match chicken styles.",

And then I threw in some wasabi cream sauce  that everyone keeps talking about.  It starts off so sweet... and ends with a kick to the nose!  Wow, what a great combination.  I think I'm in love.

I ordered the number 1 which was the baked chicken pieces) with mac n cheese and a drink. YUM! I ordered my daughter the kids menu which she picked grilled chicken (2 pieces) and french fries. As for the sauces there are a lot of choices I might say from your basic ranch to some Wasabi sauce, which I find interesting with chicken wings. I got ranch (yeah I know boring) and the BFG which is kind of like Raising Cane sauce. The Mac and Cheese was nice and cheesy and not that cheap microwavable mac and cheese.",

    "text": "Honestly I would say  BFG is a  2.5  (I always round up.)  The location itself is very small. Upon walking in you can tell its a High Schooler hang out. Which is kind of a bummer seeing how there was a group of HS kids that took up half of the whole restaurant.   The prices are very affordable. But the food I thought was lacking. Mind you I haven't tried the entire menu but over all I found it lacking. The fried strips are tempura style. They are light and crisp but in the end I have had many more flavorful tempura encounters. I will say that I enjoyed the grilled fingers but they weren't anything to write home about. With your fingers you get to choose 2 sauces. Based on other reviews I chose the wasabi cream and sweet chili. The wasabi cream had the taste of wasabi but no kick. The kick being the only reason I like wasabi made this sauce very disappointing. The sweet chili sauce was very flavorful and tasted great with the grilled strips and fries. Last but not least was the Mac and Cheese which was incredibly bland. As soon as I tasted it I knew what was missing; onion. But I guess I shouldn't expect such things from a restaurant such as this.    The highlight of this establishment is the owner; Jin. He is very friendly and talks to all his customers and even remembers your name from previous visits. But after being here twice I don't think I will revisit.   The bottom line is: They serve affordable food aimed towards teenagers and broke college students. Great service but mediocre food. Common sense states \"You Get What You Pay For.\"  Happy Eating, Jace",

    "text": "As others have explained, their menu is very limited, offering only 3 types of chicken strips (baked, grilled or fried) and 3 types of sides (baked mac n cheese, grilled veggies or french fries)... and all combos come with Texas Toast.  Oh and I think they offer a salad too, but I didn't even look at that. haha  For our first BFG experience, there were 3 of us, so we thought we should try all 3 types of chicken fingers.  We ordered 3 combos -- the baked, the fried, and the grilled.  None of us wanted to be healthy and have the grilled veggies, so we subbed another order of mac n cheese on that one.  To our surprise (being the fried chicken strip lovers we are), we all decided the GRILLED strips were the best!  I think because we were comparing the fried ones to Raising Cane's.  Sorry, guys, but I do think Cane's has ya beat in that department.  BUT... Cane's doesn't offer delicious, creamy mac n cheese baked in a cute little individual-sized bowl.  And they don't offer.... drum roll.... NINE DIPPING SAUCES.  Mmm mmm... we got to try 6 of them and they all made our chicken finger experience EXTRA deelish.  I especially loved the wasabi cream sauce (thanks to all the Yelp recommendations for that)! They were all really good, though.  Can't wait to go back and try the rest.  As everyone has mentioned already, the owners are SUPER nice and make ya feel very welcome.  In fact... yes you can call me anti-social and I'll probably get blasted for this.... but I kinda thought Jin was a little TOO nice.  I love eating somewhere where the person behind the counter actually cares about pleasing the customer.  I really do.  But I also think there's a fine line between being friendly and being annoying.  Jin was teetering on that line throughout our lunch.  I do think it's impressive how he really makes a point to learn everyone's names, but I'd really be ok if he didn't keep saying my name (followed by a question) every 3 or 4 minutes while I'm trying to eat and socialize with my family.  Know what I mean?  We'll definitely be back, though. Good chicken, great prices, friendly people.  I wish them great success.",

I have done their crispy strip meal a few times now, it's been perfectly crunchy and juicy every single time! My favorite part is their homemade dipping sauces, to which they are generous with the amount and flavor options (you get 3 per meal& each one can be different flavor)!  The owner has been there the couple of times we have gone and he has been friendly chatting with my husband. After ordering 3 full meals each time we've gone, we even got a text deal on a free meal the next time we order! I would give it 10 stars if I could it's that great!

Their fried chicken strips are made with tempura batter here which is interesting but they don't taste as good as regular chicken strips. They're pretty small for chicken strips too but looking at other peoples' photos on Yelp they're typically that small here. Personally Canes has better chicken strips as far as taste and size. The dipping sauces we tried were their strip sauce , wasabi cream and honey mustard. Wasabi cream was really good & was probably the only thing I liked out of my whole meal , the other two tasted bland. Strip sauce is kinda similar to the one at Canes but tastes more diluted. The sides they offer here were just okay too in terms of comfort food. They also sell Thai tea here too , unsure if it's authentic or not. Not expecting a high quality meal or anything but after eating my meal I wanted to go to Raising Canes to do it right.",

    "text": "Ok so I came across 'Strip N Dip' while yelping a couple of weeks ago.  As per my check-in comment \"my fat-ass saw a picture of the NACHO FRIES\" and made a detour on the way home.    There is only one location at the moment, and it happens to be on the other side of town for me.  However, I happened to be in the northwest yesterday and what a co-wink-a-dink they are too...so on to the review  Very small menu, you have the option of chicken, um chicken and oh yea chicken.  Also, baked mac&cheese, grilled vegs and funnel cake.  Chicken comes grilled or friend and like 10 different dipping sauce options, I;m not sure if those ore homemade or not.  Small interior space yet very very clean, friendly staff, and received a coupon for my next visit.  My item of choice: NACHO FRIES, hmm...where do I start???  I mean you get a lot of food for a reasonable price, the amount of fries and topping that was in the tray would had easily cost me $10+ at the competitors (which happens to be in the same business lot as Strip n Dip, ends with the letter \"O\") but that neither here nor there  For my personal liking the cut of the french fry was too thick, the plate is layered as:  FRIES on the bottom REFRIED BEANS on top of the fries CHOPPED CHICKEN on top of the beans ONIONS and TOMATOES on top of the chicken SOUR CREAM and NACHO CHEESE on top of the onions and tomatoes topped off with GREEN ONIONS  don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, it was just bland, it reminded me of a Nacho Bell Grande and its been over 5+ years since I've eaten one of those.  As I was waiting for my food, I said to myself \"should I get get some dipping sauce\" then thought otherwise...I should've got some dipping sauce, because I surely did make up a quick dipping sauce to drizzled atop of my nacho fries and topped it with some JALAPENOS.  It was missing that kickback of SPICY-NESS, you hear nachos you think of HEAT of some sort.  It was not there for me, but a great meal for my 5yr old.  I'll go back (I have a coupon) to try the mac&cheese and the funnel cake, if I find myself on that side of town again. But this is only my opinion, go check it out for yourself and see what you think...",

    "text": "I had heard about this place several times from friends of mine who are chicken strip enthusiasts and decided to check it out since it was going to be in the same part of town I was going to. It's in a shopping plaza tucked into a little corner, we almost missed it!  It's small inside, maybe six tables or so. The customer service was great, aside from in-n-out I've never encountered such friendly and enthusiastic food service workers. You have a choice of 4 or 6 strips and sides. They also had a lot of sauces you can choose from, since I like anything spicy I went with wasabi cream and buffalo. I also ordered a side of mac and cheese.   They take the food out to you which I thought was nice. Everything came out extremely hot and fresh so I had to wait a minute to enjoy it but that's how you know it's going to be amazing. The chicken was better than raising canes, in my opinion. I think it's tempura fried? Either way, very crispy and light. I loved the buffalo sauce (it was actually spicy instead of all vinegar) and the wasabi cream definitely had some heat that burned my nostrils. The Mac and cheese was extremely cheesy, I was in heaven. I would put the Mac and cheese on top of my garlic bread (carbs on carbs, delicious).   If you want fast, friendly, efficient service and fresh, delicious food, stop on in. I've been converted, raising canes won't scratch my chicken itch anymore.",

    "text": "It's a good sign when a place is packed with people because that usually means the food is bomb! It wasn't even an hour into Strip-N-Dip being open, and it was packed in there... I decided to order the food to-go because there wasn't enough seating, even after waiting and receiving the food. That wasn't a problem, though, because waiting for these chicken strips was so worth it.   The place may be hidden by the building next to it, so if you're getting directions through your phone or GPS, then just keep driving and you'll see it. The interior was black and red with checkered flooring. Everything looked clean and well-maintained. It's a bit small with limited seating, so if you come in on a busy day, chances are there will literally be no seats available.   I got the 6 fried chicken strips, which comes with a small slice of garlic bread, 3 sauces, and your choice of side. I also got one baked and one grilled strip a la carte, so I can taste the differences... I am not disappointed in what I got!  The baked strip was juicy and tender. I feel like sometimes when chicken strips are being cooked, no matter the method, they run the risk of becoming dry on the inside. I think Strip-N-Dip nailed their cooking techniques because none of their strips came out dry.   The grilled strip had the distinct \"grill\" taste. It was juicy as well, and would be the best thing in between bread for a chicken strip sandwich.   The majority of the other strips I had were fried. The fried strips were perfect! The panko breading was a golden brown with a good crunch, and the chicken inside was tender... They hit the bullseye on all of their chicken strips, so I don't think anyone would be disappointed in ordering a certain type.   As for the sauces, I got: the wasabi cream, honey mustard, and their strip sauce. The wasabi cream had the subtle taste of wasabi, but with no spiciness. It's a more of a creamy sauce (like their strip sauce), so it's better paired off with the fried strips. The honey mustard, which is a classic, was sweet and paired well with every type of strip.   Oh! And they offer Thai iced tea/coffee and funnel cake -- perfect menu items to satisfy your \"just desserts\" appetite.   Strip-N-Dip did not fail to deliver. If you're ever looking for a spot that serves chicken strips that are NOT from Cane's, then this is the spot for you!",

Mac n cheese is good too, gotta be a cheddar and something mix could be a creamier texture but tastes good, better than expected from a chicken strip joint!",

The real winner here are the sauces.  If I was eating everything without the sauces, it would be pretty boring IMO.  They have a handful of sauces, and our favs were the wasabi and the sweet chili.  The honey mustard was good, as was the teriyaki.  And the mac and cheese is very good!  Easily the best mac and cheese that isn't in a gourmet setting that I have enjoyed so far.  The baby loved all the food, and had tons of fun dipping into all the goodies here.  Should be a cool place to bring the little ones!  And just like everyone else said, the portions of chicken are a little on the small side...the 4 piece combo filled me up for the most part, but don't expect Canes sizes or you should be ordering extra pieces.  They really just need to offer a 6 piece combo, and I think that will fill up most everybody.  And the service for a fast food joint was very good.  Friendly counterstaff, talkative, and they even checked on us during and after the meal.  Drop something in their tip cup!  We will be back :)",

Not sure what changed (I read on here that they changed ownership, maybe when they changed the name?) but it doesn't blow me away like it used to, in particular the mac n cheese. Don't get me wrong- I still like it, but I opted to take it home, add some truffle salt, and it made a world of difference.",

The  Mac and cheese is pure gold, a must have for the side. The fried chicken is worth the extra calories, it's fluffy, crunchy, and juicy all in one bite. And the wasabi sauce was the best dipping sauce I ever had, I want to dip EVERYTHING in it.  I wish there wasn't that awful sewage smell. It was pretty putrid.  Definitely will be back for those after work pick ups.",

SITREP  I have to give mad props to both my Vegas Yelp-buds Anthony and Jade since they turned me onto the GREAT CHEEESY establishment BFG Chicken Strips while I was hangin with them in Vegas for the Yelp Convention back in May 2012.  THE MAC MENU  Mac N' Cheese here is TRULY an ultimate \"Classic American Eats\", as a SIDE dish OR get a BUNCH like I did at just under $2 a pop, and why not? - I took them back to my hotel room at the Stratosphere one late night and make it a MAIN dish.  Mmmm, delish!  SPECIAL PREPARATION!  BFG Chicken Strips meets a cheesaholic's strict-standards of \"cheesification\".  They make incredible BAKED Mac N' Cheese in individual containers with a Mozzarella Crust!  (HOLY HELL.  I feel my arteries hardening with joy just thinking about this festive cheesapalooza!)  THE LOWDOWN  If you are looking for a Mac n' Cheese fix, look no further.",

    "text": "This tiny little place is soon to become one of my favorite chicken joints.  BFG stands for Baked, Fired, Grilled.  The chicken strips here are, obviously, served 3 ways...  I have tried fried & grilled and I am impressed with the flavor.  The wasabi cream dipping sauce is divine.  As for sides, I have tried & enjoyed only the grilled veggies (2 skewers of zucchinni, onions, & grape tomatoes) and the baked macaroni & cheese.  Again, very good flavor & 2 kinds of cheese on the mac & cheese.  The other item I have tasted isn't strictly in the BFG category : the Chicken Nachos.  Refer to Angela H.'s review on this item of which I wholeheartedly agree.  After I have tried more items and the quality remains consistent, I'll probably upgrade my rating to 5/5...  Last visit here I went with a 2 strip combo. This comes with 2 chicken strips (duh), one side, a dipping sauce, & a 12oz drink for $4.95 (I think).  I decided on the healthy route & got grilled strips (with some type of lightly sweet Asian marinade) and the grilled vegetables.  The taste was outstanding.   The owner came out, knew the person I was with and remembered my face from my last visit.  He really wanted to know my name and it seems he is genuinely interested in pleasing his customers.  Lastly, it is open until 10 pm every day, so you can get your eat on relatively late.",

The part that turned me off is the super heavy nacho cheese sauce that is mixed with the macaroni.   The sauces were really yummy!

We both knew we would not be disappointed when we opened the door and could smell the chicken - yum!   I tried the grilled chicken and my husband got the fried - we both agreed that this strips were amazingly delicious! This is seriously best grilled chicken ever that I refused to share with the hubs. He was okay with that as he wasn't going to share his fried chicken with me since he was really enjoying them. We both had the baked mac and cheese. I'm not a huge fan of Mac and cheese, but I was surprisingly impressed and enjoyed the cheesiness and creaminess of the Mac and cheese - it was gone in a matter of minutes. We picked different dips to share and try between the two of us and we loved them all! My husband's favorite dips were the buffalo and the honey mustard. I my favorite the wasabi cream (YUM!) but I also loved strip dip and the honey mustard. Needless to say, we will definitely be back!",

If you're trying to go for the healthier option, I'd recommend the baked strips over the grilled. There just wasn't much flavor to the grilled strips.  We also got the grilled veggies and they didn't include any bell peppers as the online menu states. We tried all of the sauces too and I'd say definitely try the wasabi cream. It was the most unique option, haven't had something like it elsewhere. The BFG sauce was also good but not something totally unique.",

There is plenty of parking!  Alright so upon walking in I'm very happy to see the small but yummy looking menu! Consisting of chicken strips either baked, fried, or grilled, fries, Mac n cheese, grilled veggie, garlic bread, Thai iced coffee, and sodas.(I may have missed some stuff BUT that's the gest of it)   The guy taking my order was very friendly and greeted me right away! I ordered 2 4pc meals one grilled, one fried, side of fries,  side of mac n cheese and subbed a soda for Thai ice coffee. He gave me my soda cup right away and we sat to wait for our order and he brought my iced coffee with a cup holder over to me!! Awesome service I must say!!  The iced coffee is strong and not too sweet, I got it for hubby mostly buuuut I might just drink it lol they have coke products and a tea dispenser too. I love powerade! So we take our food home and start munching! A lot of people suggest this place is like raising canes but besides the fact that BFG serves fries, chicken, and garlic bread, all 3 of which are very different from raising canes! I love both places!! The fried chicken strips were fried using panko bread crumbs and were still crazy crunchy when I got home! The grilled strips were flavorful and cooked perfectly. I didn't care for the fries...I think they could one up raising canes even more by cooking fresh cut fries, probably more cost effective too!! The Mac n cheese was the bomb, as other reviewers have said!! I regret not getting atleast one more side cause my 3yo was OBSESSED and eating it all lol damn bein a mom and having to feed the kids ;p  okay now to the sauces! We tried honey mustard, really good, buffalo, nothing unusual, wasabi cream, can I have a bucket please?!?!? And the ranch which I am a ranch lover especially when you get it with your wings from restaurants but this ranch didn't taste like that so I will not be ordering it again :(  All in all I think I've found a brand new favorite place to eat!!! Thank you BFG can't wait till next time...maybe tomorrow????  Oh and one other thing it would be awesome if BFG were open a lil later! They close at 8 which is different for Vegas lol",

You can choose from three different options: fried chicken, grilled or baked. I personally like them fried. The food is so fresh and you can get vegetable skewers on the side if you don't want yucky fries and cole slaw like at canes ew! The food is made with love and care and the owner even works rite inside the store. He is the nicest, sweetest man. Very young and well mannered for his age. Please don't miss out on this one. It may be  a little hard to find for someone who isn't familiar with the area. It is in the home depot parking lot. Don't miss out on this great food and not to mention very reasonably priced..",

There are several combos to choose from, but I think many will customize their own meal: choose your chicken, your side and two sauces.  Easy peasy mac'n'cheesy!  I'm a big fan of the grilled chicken.  The baked is easily some of the best baked chicken I've had and the fried is the most unique fried chicken I've had (thanks to the panko flakes used for breading).  But the grilled chicken gets you the grill flavor without drying up the poultry.  Go for the wasabi sauce to give your chicken some kick.  With your chicken you're given a choice of side, and you also get a slice of bread.  The mac'n'cheese is awfully cheesy in the best way possible, making it one of those foods you enjoy eating because you know you shouldn't be eating too much of it.  Service here is great, with Jin checking on all of his customers during their stay.  He's a really personable guy, seemingly remembering every customers name once they step through the door.  (He remembered my name after one visit!)  The one thing that bummed me out in the past was that my BFG cravings always came on a Sunday, the one day they're closed!  Fortunately, Jin has sensed this disturbance in the force and will be fixing that in the near future...",

    "text": "Okay, enough already!  The Husband has been loving this place since I brought him here (thanks Yelp!) and he can't get enough!  BFG...it stands for Baked, Fried, or Grilled if you missed that part.    The menu can't be any simpler - it puts In N Out's menu to shame.  With five combos to choose from and a create your own combo, it makes ordering super easy.   Their fried chicken strips come in a four count and they are special because they are panko covered and deep fried.  Yes, that makes all the difference.  But wait, there's more beyond the chicken!  I'm talking about the wasabi cream dipping sauce that we can't get enough of.  Sure, there are other flavors and you get two with your order, but we're all about the wasabi cream!  Yum!  I've also tried their grilled chicken and was impressed with how moist it was.  Next time I'll have to check out their baked version.  Of course, I have to mention their individually baked mac and cheese side, right?  They are so gooey and hot, and that's what you call a serious baked mac and cheese.  They definitely got that right!  A little more work on their end but definitely appreciated and worth it!  Or if you must, you can have grilled veggies or fries as a side.  And there's still more to rave about - the garlic bread is good too!  Another perk - loyalty stamp cards!  Yes, that's right!  You get a stamp for every combo meal you order, so it's easy breezy to get a free combo meal with this plan!    And finally, I cannot say enough about the customer service there.  Jin is the nicest guy around - not only does he make a honest and sincere effort to know who you are (and remember your name), but he also comes around to check on you if you're dining in.  They really make you feel at home and special and I have to give major props to that alone because it really makes a huge difference.  I also have to give props to the rest of the staff because you don't have a lazy bunch working here.  They are always coming around to wipe down the tables, push in chairs, offer free dessert, and just make sure you're happy.    Their only real fault is that their location is too small!  But that only means they should open a few more locations to make our lives easier!  Yes, that's right.  Check out their weekly specials too!  They have a great thing going on here!",

If you love chicken strips...don't eat them anywhere else again until you have had them here...and then go in understanding that you will never want to eat them anyplace else, ever again.   The chicken strips are so good here they make you want to slap your momma.  (For serving you the substandard ones you grew up eating.)   Fast, friendly service, rewards cards, and an array of food choices that make it a little tough to decide what to try every time but....Just. Stay. Focused! You came for the chicken strips, which can be ordered baked, fried or grilled. Then comes an equally tough choice... the dipping sauces. The sweet chili and creamy wasabi are my personal favorites, and there are perhaps 10 others. The obligatory blue cheese and ranch are also far above average.   The chicken portions are very generous, and regardless of how you order your strips they are served hot and super moist. It appears to be all white meat, and is obviously extremely fresh.   As for the extensive choice for side dishes, I have enjoyed every one I have tried to date, however the mac and cheese is in the comfort food hall of fame. It is such a ridiculously cut above any mac & cheese I have ever had, that I could easily see myself stopping in at Strip & Dip just for an order to dine in, and one more for the road.   The place is clean, the atmosphere is very laid back and welcoming, and if I lived just a little closer...I could be in serious trouble...at some point they may have to tell me to go home once in while.  My grandchildren ask to eat here often, which actually makes quite a statement in and of itself, since they have fairly refined palettes, due to their Dad being a bit of a foodie.",

Sadly we didn't bring our little guy with us (he had plans!) but we did pick up the Baked Strips and Mac n Cheese to go and that lil bugga MOWED down the mac n cheese en route to the airport...and asked for MORE!  We chose their fried strips and grilled strips and both had to admit that their fried chicken strips are the best that we've ever had.  The coating on fried strips are light and flaky, exactly how anything battered really should be. We sampled their wasabi cream (yum), buffalo, ranch and the BFG sauces...all delish!  Their french fries are amazing.  The Hubs was giving me a stink eye the entire time since I was hijacking those fried potato morsels and in reality, I should have opted for the less healthier choice rather than their grilled veggies (I'm not a fan of onions!).  The garlic bread is yummy, very nicely flavored.    A big standout really (aside from the food) is service.  I am not high maintanence by any means but I really did enjoy having Jin come by and check on us.  I noticed that he greeted everyone that walked in and took the time to chat with the patrons in there which made it such \"welcome to our place\" feeling.  THAT you have to love.  Jin gets major props for just being awesome.  Would be come back?  Yes we have to now since our lil man tasted the mac and cheese and the the strips and is addicted now.  And for the record, now that we are back home, our lil guy was more than happy to know he had some chicken strips to bring for lunch to school.",

The couple next to our table, from Seattle, they also found the restaurant on yelp,  but researched 'Best Mac & Cheese in Vegas'. The Mac n' Cheese is the best I have ever had,  individually made and baked to perfection.  Mat delivered each order making sure customer was completely satisfied.  Rarely do you receive this high level of customer service anymore.  Will come back every time I am in town.  The name is changing to Strip n' Dip due to name duplication with a fish restaurant in another town.  Doesn't matter what the name is, you will call it delicious.",

The service is incredible and when I had to move back across the country I felt bad that I would no longer be able to give Jin my money anymore for his delicious chicken strips.  The chicken strips are great whether you get them Baked, Fried or Grilled.  I was always partial to the Fried due to the breading being so crisp.  The Mac and Cheese is wonderfully cheesy and stays hot and gooey for a very, very long time.  They offer a wide variety of dipping sauces and you really can't go wrong with them.  Pick as your mood/taste dictates.  The weekly rotating specials are also all very good choices to get.  I am partial to the nachos but the Bi Bam Bap is also fantastic.  There's a reason why BFG has consistently ranked in the top few spots for food in Vegas.  What it does it does extremely well for the food and Jin goes to great lengths that are no longer common at all to make you feel welcome and valued as a customer.  Its really strange to see how customer service has more or less died but it makes it easy for a well-run place like BFG to endear itself to so many Vegas dwellers.  I look forward to the next time I am in Vegas so I can get some fried strips, mac and cheese and hopefully, it'll be chicken nachos week.  Before we moved I was unable to eat here one last time due to surgery and had to watch my wife enjoy one more Bi Bam Bap from there while I drank an Ensure.  A tough thing to endure.  Actually, as I submit this review I see its chicken nachos week and it pains me to know I can't get any, well, barring a 2100 mile flight/drive...",

Eff that - go with the tastiest option.  Mac and cheese was decent as well.  Looking forward to trying their rice bowls, nachos, and korean dish who's spelling I don't want to butcher.  Owner is nice and friendly - though I personally didn't feel like talking that day so he probably thought I was rude.    Check it out!  Delicious.",

    "text": "My husband and I were on our way to dine in at the Pizza Hut on charleston and antelope last night, and discovered that it was permanently closed :(   we had to find an alternative route fast, as our one year old was hungry and getting cranky.  My husband found this place on his phone and the ratings were really good, so we decided that trying something new is always good.  wow...the food was amazing!    The chicken was cooked perfectly, it was not heavy or greasy and it felt like the perfect amount of food.  we ordered the grilled chicken meal with the mac and Cheese and an order of the baked chicken with fries, and just decided to mix and match pieces from each plate. the Mac and cheese was to die for and the sauces were really good as well.  We shared a bit  of everything with our one year old. He scarfed everything down...he loved it :)  Not to forget .....on top of the great food, the service was amazing as well. Jin checked on us twice, and even sat down to talk with us for a little bit.  He is the nicest guy and you can tell that he cares how the customers are doing and if they enjoyed their meal.   In small restaurants in this town, great service is very hard to find.   We were very happy with our choice, and will go back there again in a heart beat.  BFG... Keep up the good work!",

    "text": "This place is different, but good.   They offer combos for their chicken fingers. You can get them baked, grilled or fried. And they have Baked Mac + Cheese, French Fries and/or Grilled Veggies to combo your chicken choice with. Plus you get a garlic bread piece. These combos come out to about $6.  I got baked with Mac & Cheese.   They say you get four chicken strips with your order, but with the baked, it seemed like I got a few more...which was a good thing because they were small.   Seems like a very healthy alternative, especially if you go with the baked or grilled, plus the veggies. Not very exciting, but healthy. Plus, they have a good selection of  sauces for your strips...I guess this is where you try and add some excitement to your food and give your taste buds something to celebrate.",

Ok, not ALL but many ways one can choose to cook it. BFG means baked, fried, grilled and I surprisingly really liked everything ordered. Here's the run down, baked and fried chicken, both moist and good flavor. Baked Mac n' Cheese, comes in a small mini pie tin. It's very cheesy! And unexpectedly the best item was the nachos! Really good. Tip: ask for a side of BBQ sauce and drizzle it on top of the nachos for a little more enjoyment. The owners name is Matt, he said he was \"Chicken Charlie's cousin!\" He's VERY friendly.",

    "text": "We decided to try this place out soley based on the Yelp reviews & recommendations. We approached the counter with our three daughters, who were very excited that a restaurant's main entree was chicken strips. The cashier/order-taker is by far the nicest person in Vegas, though there are lots of nice people there (he wasn't wearing a name tag). He asked us if we'd been there before (first time), thanked us for coming in & quickly explained the menu as well as offered suggestions.  We ordered the Family Meal and per his suggestion split the chicken strips three ways: fried, grilled and baked. The meal came with four sides so we again went with his suggestion: 3 homemade, baked macaroni & 1 french frie(s). It also came with 5 slices of garlic bread and lots of homemade sauces. There are only four tables inside but we were able to snag one and eat in. All three \"types\" of strips were really good! None of them were dry. My husband really liked the wasbi cream, I think their buffalo is great. Their baked macaroni was a hit from our toddler to us parents.  I'm a people watcher (okay, yes an eavesdropper!) and noticed that the cashier was super nice & helpful to everyone that came in. Seriously, having such awesome customer service makes patrons come back for great food or try a second time. :)",

We have tried the baked, grilled and fried chicken strips.....all of the styles were very good and everything is cooked to order.  I love the sides....but the marinated vegetables are really awesome.  There are about 8 - 10 dipping sauces to choose from and although I love all of the ones that I have tried....the wasabi cream sauce is my favorite!!! I drive from Henderson and it is well worth the drive.....although I would love if they would open more locations around the valley.....maybe Henderson will be next?  ;-)   This place is a great example of having a great product with great service!!!!",

The owner is amazing, he makes a big effort to remember everyones name and is really attentive (walks around and does refills when the cash register slows down). My favorite is the weekly specials they offer, especially the chicken nachos...YUM!! Now I am a huge sucker for fake cheese nachos and these are fantastic fake cheese nachos!

We had ranch and buffalo sauce for dipping and they were both good. We went right before lunch hour rush and it was already busy. It's not a big establishment and there's not many spots for seating. Because its so small, once it's packed it feels like people are hovering over your table while you eat, so I would say that's the biggest downfall.",

I got an additional side of the mac and cheese, which was a big mass of cheesy goodness. Oh man, I can't wait to come back and try their other types of chicken strips and sauces.  So I definitely suggest anyone who's hungry and on a budget to give this place a shot, because it might just become your new best friend. I think it might have just become one of mine! Woo HOO!

    "text": "After all the rave reviews,on purpose, I went after the lunch rush so that I can sit and take my time to enjoy my food. Since it was my first time, I ordered the 4 pc basket w/ the baked mac 'n cheese combo. I made sure I told the guy at the counter it was my first time here and I consider myself a fried chicken expert. Plus, I wanted everything cooked to order as that is the only True way to test the food. The chicken was hot 'n juicy with a coating of the light tempura breading. But, the star of the restaurant was the baked macaroni 'n cheese! This item was worth the trip. It was baked in an aluminum pot pie tin and had oddles of cheese, creamy noodles and just the right amount of butter. Very good quality ingredients!  So, for under $6 BUCKS, including drink and a toasted garlic bread w/ 2 dipping sauces...what a great deal!   Now, there are a lot of restaurants out there that offer chicken tenders. I have to rate this #2 on my list.   My number #1 pick is Carl's Jr... I know, what about Canes? But, if you go to Carl's Jr. and make sure you tell the cashier you want them \"cooked to order\" and it's OK if it takes longer to wait....you may agree with me, they are hot & juicy with just the right amount of seasoning and breading! Finally, the fries at BFG were hot & tasted OK, but my number #1 pick for french fries is Nathan's. Yes, the hot dog place!   OK, so according to this writer, you go to Carl's Jr. for your chicken tenders, Nathan's Hot Dogs for your fries and yes, of course, BFG for the baked Mac 'n Cheese. Got it?   Oh, I almost forgot drinks & dessert. Circle K for a 44 oz Soda of your choice for 85 cents and for dessert, try the No-Bake Chocolate Fudge at....I hate to say, but at the Wal-Mart Bakery! lol",

    "text": "More of a 4.5. BFG is GOOD chicken! get ready for me to say \"really good\" 100 times.  (Full disclosure: I know the owners/chefs, but that won't make me go twice in a week. The FOOD makes me go back 2x!)  Portion sizes are plenty! The meals are $5.75, I think, and that is 4 strips, plenty of fries/sides with dipping sauces. Here's what we've had:  Grilled Chicken is juicy and has a very nice, fresh yet mild marinade. The quality of the chicken seem higher than grilled chicken you get at KFC or other fast foods.  Fried Chicken is panko-breaded which is a great switch from the norm, and just as juicy as the grilled chicken. If you want a fuller meal, go for these! My husband thinks this portion size borders on large. I don't love fried food, because I tend to feel the grease in my mouth for hours (cough cough, CANES). But these are fresh and leave the plate dry! No grease there. Super good.  The french fries are super good. They are the kind of fries that have that texture like they've been rolled in a batter, on the skinny side, with just enough salt to make them irresistible.  The grilled veggies (zucchini or squash, onions, roma tomatoes) are a point of contention for me. I thought they tasted great (they seem to be lightly marinated in the same sauce as the grilled chicken), but the cuts of veggies were on the small side. That is a personal preference for me, though. I would rather have a crunchy bite of zucchini in there still.   THE DIPS: Oh Em Gee!! BFG rounds out their high-quality chicken with amazing, freshly made (I think they are homemade?!) dips that range from regular to wacky.  Honey Mustard like I used to get in the south! you can see the mustard seeds in there! I loved it with the fries and fried ckn.  BFG sauce is good, it seems to be something like a soy with a thicker base, with a little sweetness and seasonings? I can't figure it out, but its really good on the grilled chicken.  Wasabi Cream! Nice Choice BFG. Talk about something different and very good! Its not overly strong (maybe they could offer a dollop of wasabi so you can change the strength? I like wasabi A LOT), its a wonderful change to a world of ketchup/ranch.  Sweet Chili is another welcome change. if you like a little heat, mixed with a little sweet, this is for you!  The only dip I didn't love is the Ranch, but that's another personal thing. I love buttermilk Hidden Valley Ranch (hey! i'm a southern girl) and no other. and this isn't that. but with the other dips, I don't mind!  They made me a taste-test of fried mac & cheese balls, if they put that on the menu, get it! it was good (panko breaded too).  All of the meals come with good garlic bread, great friendly service, and its made when you order it. So be prepared to wait about 5 minutes (worth it).  I would think this would be great family stop on a weeknight or a weekend, or good take out (I'm going to try takeout sometime to see how it holds up). The place is small, like probably seats 15 people, but its definitely a place to try. Several times.",

I like having the option of choosing the method whereby my food is cooked.  I wish other establishments would offer the same.  I also like having pictures to accompany the menu so I know what I'm getting into.  The service was top notch; the owner recognized the fact that it was my first time at BFG. Customer service is incredibly important to me and the owner did a fine job of building rapport.  I am a fan of the BFG and sweet chili sauce which complemented the baked chicken well.  Mac and cheese was creamy and cheesy, a treat considering the boxed stuff I was raised on...I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.  Thanks to the owners for a great lunch experience.  Will be back again!",

I've never tried the fried strips, but the grilled and baked strips are both juicy and flavorful with their respected marinades.  The Mac & Cheese was on point, as usual; browned top layer of mozzarella covering a generous portion of creamy, cheesy macaroni.  The garlic toast is just so-so, but a thoughtful addition to the meal. I've tried most of the sauces, and I have to say that the Wasabi Cream is by far the best.  The Teriyaki is also a good compliment.  I plan to try the honey-mustard on my next visit!  I want to try the grilled veggies also... They look incredible, but I can never bring myself to part with the Mac & Cheese!",

As some others have said...I don't think that panko breading is the best option for chicken.  It is more appropriate for seafood.  It does not have enough flavor for my taste.  The chicken itself was fresh and of high quality.  If I were to return (I won't) I would try the grilled or baked chicken.  They do offer some flavorful sides to dip the chicken in.  I had the Mac & Cheese as a side.  The Mac and Cheese was not great.  The macaroni was way over cooked and the sauce itself tasted like Kraft Mac & Cheese.  It was very orange and tasted like it was derived from a powder.  I did not taste any breadcrumbs on top (that is what the menu stated).  There was however a nice amount of real cheese melted on top of the side.  I would skip this place unless you are a fan of panko and like very little flavor.",

    "text": "I have found my chicken strip spot next to the vicinity in which I call work. The name of the game here is OPTIONS, ALL OF THE OPTIONS. It merits caps, really, it does. It also has an awesome name. Come on, admit it, it does.   Food: They have 3 meal deals. They are the following: A 6 strip combo, which comes with 6 chicken strips, 1 side, 3 sauces, a garlic bread, and a drink (20 oz).  3 Strip Combo comes with 3 strips, 2 sauces, a garlic bread, and drink. (That's the one I usually get, as it's just the right amount of food and it's ohhh so good.) Lastly, the 2 strip meal which has 2 strips, 1 side, 1 sauce, and a kids sized drink (12 oz).  - Here is the fun part. THE OPTIONS, YAY! You can get your chicken either baked, grilled, or fried. I'm a fan of their grilled chicken, since deep fried food doesn't like me. Their baked chicken is decent, but in my option grilled is the way to go. They have a good variety of sauces too, and oh man, if you like sauces, you'll like this place. What kind of sauces do they have, you ask? Well kids, here's a list: BBQ, Buffalo (one I always get), Strip Sauce, Cheese, Honey Mustard, Ranch, Sweet Chili, Teriyaki, and Wasabi Cream. I've tasted the Buffalo, Ranch, Strip Sauce, Cheese, and Teriyaki and I'm a fan. The teriyaki was a little weird and not one of my favorites, but it wasn't by any means horrible.  Oh yeah, you also get that side! Their sides are mac and cheese, french fries, or grilled veggies. Their mac and cheese is decent for fast food, and their french fries are pretty good as well. None of them are something to write home to mother about, but hey, you are coming here for the chicken anyway, right? I hope so.  - Service: So far so good! The people working there are friendly, tell you about their loyalty program and like to make you smile. It can get busy during lunch so there is a little bit of wait time, but nothing compared to some places.   I say try it once, at least for the sauces and chicken. Everything I've tasted there has been om nom nomable to the extreme and it has now became my go to place for chicken at work. :D Keep it classy Strip N Dip.",

    "text": "This could possibly be my favorite place to eat in all of Vegas.  It's located in a strip mall on the NW corner of Charleston and Rainbow- which is right in my neighborhood, making it one of the only restaurants I frequent near my home.  The owner, Jin, is seriously the friendliest person I've met. He knows everyone's name- seriously, everyone! He always remembers me and everyone else who comes here, which makes us all keep coming back!  So now, about the food.. These chicken strips are delicious. I've tried all three varieties. The baked have so much flavor, and the grilled are great too. My favorite is the fried. These are not your typical American chicken strips- battered, sodium laden, and fried. These chicken strips are panko breaded and fried to perfection- coming out steaming hot, crispy on the outside, and perfectly moist on the inside.  I like to pair my chicken strips with a side of their incredible mac and cheese. They make it extra special by melting some fresh cheese on the top of your portion- adding some texture and oozing cheese fun!  Their french fries are great too, crispy and flaky. They obviously know what they're doing, unlike in-n-out burger, whose fries are chewy and flavorless.  Their choices of dipping sauces beat the pants off any fast food restaurant, especially your average McDonalds or Chic-Fil-A. It's fun to experiment with different flavor combinations with your strips- and it'll keep you coming back.  The prices are also extremely low. You will leave here satiated for only a few bucks. The thing that impressed me was how you can add more strips to your meal for low price as well. And an extra side of mac and cheese is only a buck fifty. Score!!  Try this place- it's more than a hipster teenager hang out. To me, it's the best bang for your buck in Vegas. If you're looking for some good food cheap, BFG is your place.",

While I was waiting on her, I hit the \"nearby\" button on the mobile app and BFG was right on top of the list.  We were in a rush so I read her the last couple of top tips on the place... She ordered the baked strips and I ordered 5 fried strips a la carte with ranch and wasabi cream (yelpers know everything - thanks guys for the tip)..  We took it to go, but drooled as we saw those dining in munching on their food. It was a tiny little place but the service was great (the guy that handed us our to go order - I really believed him when he said - Have a nice weekend).  Our food was piping hot and super moist and crunchy. I really liked it.  my ONLY complaint was I paid 40 cents a piece for the sauce and it was a tiny little cup that was barely half full. I mean - I barely had enough for 3 strips. Fill er up please for next time!!  I am definitely coming back though - and ordering the mac and cheese because every table in there (lol so like 6) had some mac and cheese on it and it looked amazing.  Definitely worth a try --- it was pretty awesome!",

The chicken strips were very juicy and had a lot of flavor.  Especially the grilled ones. You're always skeptical about ordering grilled chicken because it's usually dry, these were far from it.   The Mac and cheese was also delicious.  Very cheesy and a great crust of cheese on top.  Could have used a little more salt though.  Garlic bread could have just been left out.  Nothing special there.    Dipping sauces were the best part of the meal.  The wasabi cream was the best.  The sweet chili dipping sauce and the honey mustard had great flavor.  The BFG sauce was just a plain old fry sauce with a little extra acid.   Overall a great meal.  We will be back.",

One night there was a special request for chicken fingers, which resulted in me bookmarking BFG for future enjoyment, since the thought of panko-breaded fingers was too much for her to handle.  Last night the hubster and I were in the area, and decided to finally give it a try. We ordered a four and two finger combo, with four fried fingers and two baked fingers, one mac & cheese, fries, and three sauces - BBQ, BFG, and wasabi cream.  I wish we would have had a dozen of the baked fingers - they were honestly that good. Extremely moist, well-seasoned, and flavorful. They were even better with a bit of the wasabi cream (although I was hoping that the sauce would be slightly more pungent.  The fried fingers were a little disappointing. They were definitely crispy, and still moist, but I was surprised by the blandness. The BBQ sauce was pretty standard, but the BFG sauce was too sweet and 1000 Island-esq for my liking. The cheesy crust on the mac & cheese was nice, but I thought the noodles/sauce needed more seasoning.  Overall, this is a solid place, and I'll definitely be back when I'm in the neighborhood - specifically to get the baked fingers, wasabi cream, and probably the grilled veggies.",

It's now a small stringy looking funnel cake with room temperature chocolate on the side which is sad because this was the one place in town I knew had delicious funnel cakes and now it's a disappointment. Also the wait last time was a little long...I put in a to go order only for me no one was with me. Walked in to pick up and waited a minute and then someone ordered 5-10 mins after me and got their food before me which was weird. Sucks this place is delicious (except the funnel cakes now) but it's not likely I'll be back.",

I was pleasantly surprised by the taste of the chicken strips. They are breaded with Japanese breadcrumbs so you can't go wrong with that. When you want to order chicken strips, you are given three choices: baked, grilled, or fried.  To accompany my fried chicken strips, I opted for the strip sauce and the BBQ sauce. I did not like the strip sauce at all. It tasted like tartar sauce mixed with ketchup. I did enjoy the simple BBQ sauce. The garlic toast was nice and buttery. The Mac N Cheese was nice and cheesy so I was happy with that side order choice.",

We ordered a whole bunch of food, got plenty full, and only spent $14!  Before I start, BEST GRILLED VEGETABLES EVER. Perfectly cooked, great grill marks, fresh, tasty veg. YAY!!! If you like spicy, grab the sriracha on the counter and squeeze it on the veggies. A-mazing.  The fried chicken strips, with a crispy panko crust, are the best. Our next favorite were the grilled, followed by the baked. They were all plenty good, though!  Their sauces were awesome. Loooved the honey mustard. BBQ sauce was good!  The baked mac and cheese is really cheesy--medium cheddar sauce, mozzarella crust. Rich, but it's a small side portion and ends up being perfect.  Service was great too--the employees looked like they might be a bunch of punks, but they were super polite and courteous and even made friendly small talk with us as they came around and cleaned up tables! They even remembered that we were in town on a road trip when they came out and chatted with us about that. Good employees!!!  Everything was so good. My stomach is growling writing this. Why am I 500 miles away?! We'll be back next time we're in town for sure. Wish they did desserts! I bet they'd do really good ones.",

    "text": "I was so excited to try this place. I love chicken fingers and this place has a meal that you can put the chicken fingers on a sub roll! I love chicken finger subs but can never find them in Vegas and I think this is the closest I may come to one.  I decided to order the Hot Chicks meal which is two chicken finger \"subs\" and one side. I decided to try the mac and cheese since it looked delicious in all the pictures. On top of the chicken fingers in a spicy sauce and it comes with lettuce, tomatoes and onions. I opted for no onions just because i'm not a huge fan.  I really enjoyed the meal. The chicken and the sauce it was served with tasted really good and I ate it all! I just wish the bread it was served on was deeper and more of a sub roll because it was hard to eat. The mac and cheese was just ok. I felt like all the cheese was at the top of the dish when it should have been more spread throughout the noodles.   I would try just the regular chicken strips next time because you are able to pick three sauces with it and would like to try the variety of sauces they offer.",

    "text": "A strong competitor to Raising Cane but I personally prefer Strip N Dip over them!  Located next to Home Depot on Rainbow, b/t Charleston and Alta. Seems like a mom n' pop shop with great chicken strips. Service is friendly and fast with simple menu.   I went with their 6-piece chicken strip combo ($9.70 with tax) which comes with small piece of bread, a choice of side (baked mac n'cheese, fries or veggies) and 3 choices of sauce. For side, I went ahead with baked mac n' cheese that everyone and their dog raved about. As for sauce, I decided to try bbq, strip sauce and ranch.   They have 3 different options for their chicken strips. I got the baked one which is rotisserie style, but they also have fried which has panko breading and grilled option for more healthy choice.   Baked chicken had light seasoning and went well with all 3 sauces I got. Mac n' cheese was cheesy and good. I wish the piece of garlic bread they provided was a bigger piece. Perfect size to feed the pigeon walking around but not enough for a starving human being.   Great comfort food. I wish they made 8 or 10 piece combo too because 6 is just not enough..I would come back again though.",

    "text": "So I'm updating my review after last night's awful disappointment. I'm never coming back here again. I feel like since they moved with the bar they have become absolutely terrible. We ordered last night (Thursday) around 8ish. 2 meals that were 6 pieces of fried chicken, one with a macaroni side and the other with fries. They were supposed to come with 6 sauces total. We opted to get 3 ranches, 2 cheeses, and 1 of their strip sauces.  First of all, it said I was gonna get free delivery, and they ended up charging me for delivery, a lot higher price than other places too which is bothersome because I live a lot closer to here than other places with lower delivery fees. Also, they don't allow you to order drinks, how ridiculous is that? Anyway, we get our order and the first thing we notice is that they messed up our sauces. We got 2 ranches, 1 cheese, 2 buffalo, and one that I was assuming was their strip sauce but it looked absolutely too disgusting to taste. Also, the cheese wasn't cooked right or something, it was rubbery. We dipped a fry in there and the whole thing came up with it. The ranch tasted cheaper than store bought. Then we look at the garlic toast we were supposed to get. My piece didn't have any garlic or anything on it. It was literally plain, overly burnt toast. The other piece was too burned making it too hard to eat. Almost like biting into a golf ball. (I use a golf ball as an example because that's about how small it was too). To think, they charge $.50 a piece if you don't order the meal, rip off! The fries tasted like trash and the chicken was so bland that I only ate one piece. The only semi decent thing was the macaroni but definitely not good enough to make us want to go back.  Not to mention that right after eating, we got the stomach flu. It makes me think they don't clean their cooking area or something because we shouldn't have gotten sick from the food. We spent $27 to get the stomach flu, how wonderful. This was such a terrible experience, we will never go back again. It's a shame, we used to go quite often.",

Once I stepped in the staff was very friendly, probably some of the best hospitality I've received for such a small restaurant! I asked what they would suggest to order and they recommended the fried strips and fries, boom, ordered.   The chicken had a great texture and the fries were nice and crunchy but without sauce they were both rather bland. I dipped them in both ranch and the BFG sauce and they helped with the dish.   I also ordered some grilled chicken, mac n cheese, and grilled veggies to-go for my boyfriend and he didn't like the mac and cheese at all (however, he's from the south and pretty picky about his mac n cheese)  Over all it's not bad but I doubt I would go out of my way to stop in again.",

I recommend going with the fried chicken with baked mac, especially if you need a last meal before death (it is pretty rich, it might serve as executioner!)

BFG stands for Baked, Fried, Grilled which are the 3 options for how to have your chicken strips.

There's something for those who come just to stuff their face and something for the more health conscious.  The owner, Jin, is super friendly and he definitely makes it his mission to have a relationship with each of his customers.  The artwork on the walls are cute and inviting.  This is a great mom&pop shop. A definite cane's replacement. In fact, they are even cheaper than cane's! I LOVE THAT!  Speaking of canes, I could choose BFG's garlic bread over Cane's texas toast ANY DAY, HANDS DOWN. The garlic bread is smaller, but it tastes way better.  Only downfall, it's nowhere near my house.

However, I'm revising it and taking away 1 star simply due to Matt (the owner) and his over-the-top, near-creepy, downright-obnoxious attempts at \"friendliness\". Really, this guy is just WAY too much to handle. I expect to have to deal with the transparently-fake \"used car salesman\" type when I'm shopping for a car, but it's the last thing I want to deal with when I'm trying to eat dinner. I genuinely appreciate quality, friendly service (as I also said in my earlier review), but this guy's shameless, ridiculous, contrived, almost insulting \"enthusiasm\" is bordering on unbearable. In short, while I love their food, Matt's irritating shtick is in danger of keeping me and my wife away from this place. Reel it in, man. You're literally chasing customers away.",

However, the total package (when you add a drink) is a little high at about $10+ if you get the 6 strip combo (which you will want if you get baked or grilled because you won't have batter 'adding mass').   The fries seem like they are from a distributor, which is weird coming from a place that wants to elevate the chicken strip to an art form. I understand that this is likely to achieve economies of scale not possible in a one-location business. Additionally, several of the sauces (including barbecue, but I forget the others) are from a vendor as well, and not made in-house.  This is important, at least to me, because for about $7.60, you can get a 'naked strips' combo at Popeyes and get basically the same amount of product, and arguably of similar or better quality. (Popeyes is fresh, not frozen, and has invested in test kitchen R+D for the various marinade/spice mixes used on the naked strips.)  If I were getting the fried ones, I would have a hard time coming here frequently, just based on the quality and price of other options that are equally fresh and made-to-order such as Raising Cane's. But I'd still add this place to my rotation, easily.",

    "text": "Well, where can I begin about the rise and downfall of BFG? First owned by two nice guys by the names of Jin and Tin. Their goal was to make a place dedicated to chicken and pleasing the customer. Jin the front man of the whole operation was a genuinely nice person who was always trying to keep the customer satisfied and happy. He was always willing to listen and give his opinion but  in a way that wasn't offensive.The man even went as far to remember everyone's name that came through those doors But that was only half of it, their food was amazing, the line would lead to the door . My favorite things to order were the fried strips with macaroni and cheese, wasabi sauce and bfg sauce.  This went on for about 2 years. By then Tin had gotten a career he wanted and Jin had decided that it was time to pursue what he wanted in life so they sold the restaurant.  I had been a month since they sold it when I decided to come in one day with a friend. As soon as we walked in I was greeted by one of the new owners named Jessie I believe.  He asked us for our name and if we had ever been there before stuff like that. While ordering he seemed to push us into getting the large cup for our drinks but in a way that sounded like some terrible salesman. For an owner this kid seemed as if it was his first day of working he was just so awkward. As we were waiting to get our food we see Matt another one of the owners go over to check up on customers and we see him approach a table of highschool aged girls to which he very awkwardly started to hit on them and make everyone very uncomfortable. After this very unprofessional stunt he comes over to us  and tries talking to us asking us our names stuff like that. We answered him but he still kind of stuck around he might as well as had his nose in our butts and licking our shoes he came off a little desperate or as a total kissass. By now we had been waiting a good 15 minutes for our food which is a little late for their usual delivery. We later found out that Matt was the second cook so when he came out to talk to everyone he left the other cook there by himself to take care of everything. We get our food , eat, and leave. After being dragged into going again about a month ago by some friends we walk in to see that the whole restaurant is no longer the comfortable quaint place it used to be. New tacky marble tables, they had stuck in a giant beverage fridge that seems really out of place and awkward, they had replaced the old menus with tv screens(2 of which were turned  off so you couldnt see the whole menu), and on the counter they had a very out of place beverage thing? Its like they really stick it in your face about trying to by their beverages. The new owners must be trust fund babies or something to be able to throw away this much money. Matt who is now at the counter greets us and takes our orders. Jessie is now no where to be seen( I guess blue collar work was too much for him!). We receive our food and the first thing I notice is that the fried chicken is no longer that crispy. Afterwards I noticed that their macaroni had become very soupy like they dont let it dry anymore and that the wasabi cream no longer had a kick to it. All in all I am very saddened to see how terribly the new owners have crashed this restaurant.",

You have a choice of sides, fires, mac and cheese or grilled vegetables.  They have one of the mega selection soda machines, which I like, better than the burger kings, with the same machines, which doesn't have the add-on flavorings like cherry. ( To be fair, the burger king I was in, was the first time I saw this mega machine, the other locations may keep their's stocked)  We both had the four strips fried, with mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was great, I saw the person at the next table was having the grilled vegetables, they looked great, I asked, he said they were excellent. I will definitely have to try them. First time there, I didn't know.  They have a large selection of dipping sauces, buffalo, ranch, teriyaki, wasabi cream, sweet chili, bbq, honey mustard, bfg (think Cane's) and cheese.  Now to the strips. I don't understand this, I had 4 strips, two were perfect, two were rubbery. I got the impression they cooked them when you order them, I still have that impression. The strips were the same size, how can they come out different.  If I had four of the of the perfect strips, I would have given a 4. if I had four of the rubbery ones, I would have given a 1.  I gave a 3 because of the mac and cheese was great, two of the strips were good and the soda mach was fully stocked.  I will try it again, in hopes of getting 4 good strips.",

The BFG original is tasty, too, it tastes very similar to Thousand Island,  My only beef with them is that their hours of operation aren't that great, but I am sure with time and demand they'll extend their hours.

    "text": "3.5 stars.  I have had BFG on my list of \"must try\" for awhile and we finally ventured in last week.  We ordered take-out and ordered the BFG trifecta. 1 Baked meal, 1 Fried meal, and 1 Grilled meal, and selected 6 different sauces to accompany them.    We live less than 10 minutes away and the meal was still fresh and piping hot by the time we laid it out on our dining table.  Everything tasted pretty good, but didn't wow my taste buds like I had expected.  My husband preferred the fried chicken and baked mac n cheese, while I preferred the the grilled chicken and grilled veggies.  The extra .5 is because the service was awesome, and it truly is an amazing value- and because of that, I will be back.  Besides, I still need to try their specials!",

    "text": "It's a rare occurrence that I even post a review at all, so take it for what it is: that it is damn amazing... and I haven't even touched any food yet.  Now why can it be amazing? The service was awesome. It may be just talking to the guy and giving him a form of payment, but man does he make a conversation out of it. He even remembers a lot of the people that have come and gone, asks them how the days been, explains the menu... hell, the man pretty much did everything but explain to me how taxes work. That's called service.  (EDIT: HIS NAME IS JIN. I feel bad that I forgot the first time around. Sorry dude!!)  Anyway, let's move on to the actual food...    Imagine a juicy chicken strip that's moist on the inside and yet somehow crunchy and flaky on the outside. It almost doesn't seem possible (the close comparison always is Cane's, but I'll explain why that's an impossible comparison), but that's exactly what BFG has done with their Fried Chicken. It's almost unthinkable as to what madness occurred for this to be possible, but it's been done. Not only is their Fried chicken that moist, but pretty much everything else is as well. The Baked chicken strips were peppered with some seasonings and baked to perfection, it comes out very moist and tasty. I'm not one for Baked Chicken Strips, but I'd try it every once in awhile if it had come down to it.  In addition to the chicken, their sides are very well done. Naturally, if you like/love/adore/lust after Mac and Cheese, then dear god go for the Mac and Cheese; it's baked goodness in a tinfoil pie thing. Their salad was enjoyable, but if you're going there to get fried chicken in a salad, you really need to get some priorities in order and really just stop kidding yourself.   Naturally the big kicker is their array of sauces. I'm officially a big fan of their \"BFG\" sauce, simply because it's got a bit of everything in the flavor spectrum in \"BBQ, spicy, and sweetness.\" None of that made sense, but that's the only way to describe it. Their Honey Mustard is something unique as well, so if y'all love it, go for it.  All in all, BFG is a chicken place that I might very well swap for Cane's from time to time, because (1) It's good food; it's good chicken... and (2) It's closer to me than Cane's. I mean, I'll still go to both equally (Cane's is open longer, so that's always a reason I won't abandon Cane's), but somehow BFG will make it into my routine.  ... oh, and having a stamp card helps too. (b^^)b =7  SIDENOTE: So I was saying why you can't compare Cane's Fried Chicken with BFG Fried Chicken... I (personally, ie. MY OWN OPINION) believe that you can't compare two different styles of fried chicken strips. Cane's uses a batter of some sort, whereas BFG uses more Panko bread crumb-type food source. It's like comparing Apples and Oranges; useless. You just need to know that Cane's is good and BFG is good too. (b^^)b",

    "text": "\"#1 Restaurant Best of Yelp\" Need I say more?.. I'm on my way!  Came here on a Sunday evening, they were half full but no wait. The Gentleman at the counter, Jin was Extremely Personable and guessed that I was a Yelper! Haha, nice. I found that he was the owner and his partner/owner, Tin was handling the backend/cooking. I did go with the Combo #1 with Grilled Chicken Tenders/Strips with the Wasabi Cream sauce and the suggested Sweet Chili sauce. It also came with Mac N Cheese, a slice of Garlic Bread and a Drink. All for under 6 bucks, Not bad.. Then, ordered their Special of the Day: \"Hot Chick\" - fried chicken tender, in a hotdog bun with their hot sauce and veggies.. Plus, I ordered a side of their baked chicken tenders and fried chicken tenders (just to have a taste of all the chicken variety they offered). And I also tried their buffalo and ranch sauces too.  My take on the items:  Baked Chicken Tenders: 3.5 Stars. Tasted healthy but didn't have much flavor.. The sauce took care of it though.  Grilled Chicken Tenders: 4/5 Stars. Mildly flavored, a bit sweet and tasty.  Fried Chicken Tenders: 5/5 Stars. The Breading (Panko?) was absolutely delicious with the chicken. Like a Tempura Chicken Tender!  Wasabi Cream Sauce: 3.5/5 Stars. Unique and mild wasabi flavor. Nice and creamy but didn't Wow me like I was expecting.  Sweet Chili Sauce: 4/5 Stars. Sweet, a tiny bit spicy , like a teriyaki type sauce. This was pretty good.  Buffalo and Ranch Sauces: 3/5 Stars. Both decent, as expected  Hot Chick (special): 3.5/5 Stars Think of Fried Chicken Tender hot dog with hot sauce and veggies. Not bad. But it did make me order more Fried Chicken Tenders!  Mac N Cheese: 4/5 Stars, Easy. Not the Best I've had but Way Better than KFC's! I think there were a couple different cheeses working together with that Nacho cheese oozing in the middle of it all! I'm a Fan!  Service was Superb, No Question! For a place like this, I never would of expected to feel like a V.I.P.! I think Jin asked me twice if I wanted a refill for my drink but Annie (the wife of Tin, the other owner) was quick to give me a refill before and after Jin already asked me.. Also, follow ups on the food and.. It goes on.. The Food and Value was better than Average. This Local Business Got My Support!!",

    "text": "BFG or Baked Fried Grilled delivers on every level.  Admittedly, I have a bit of  problem when it comes to any place to eat.  I always feel the need to compare anytime I eat at multiple places that offer the same types of food.  Prior to coming into BFG, I frequented Raising Cane's quite a bit.  At the time, I believed Cane's to have the best chicken fingers around.  In my opinion, they still do.  However, BFG has more variety and variety is the spice of life.  Here's what I mean:  BFG offers a wide array of sauces, six to be exact.  I don't remember the names of all of the sauces that are offered, but I know that I was pleased with the Wasabi Cream and the Sweet Chili.  Cane's offers one type of sauce and not much else.  I ordered the Number 2, which included four fried strips, fries (crispy and delicious) and a side of garlic bread, all for around $6.00.  I was also able to sample a baked strip, which was good and a side of their mac and cheese which was creamy and very filling all on its own.   The Chicken Nachos were also good (my friend ordered these, I swear I'm not a total fat-ass).    I am most impressed with their options.  They also offer baked or grilled strips and replace french fries for vegetables, a very good choice for those on a diet.",

I woke up this morning dreaming of the crisp, moist, juicy goodness.   In addition to the sexcellent strips, we were treated to Jin educating 3-4 teens on the importance of going to college.  There were no eyes rolling.  These younstas took everything in with BFG glazed eyes. The teens, kids, Sr citizens love him. He is definitely the everyday people person who could relate to anyone.  BFG - not only can u get drug-like addictive food but you can also drop your kids off for youth counseling............................................... All this...

We also ordered a funnel cake and that was pretty darn good too.   I got the baked chicken, but I wish I'd just gone ahead and gotten the fried (damn me and my new healthy lifestyle initiative!). The baked chicken was good, but it was too salty for my taste. Maybe I'm just really sensitive to salt?  Also, for a chicken strip place, they make some pretty legit Thai iced tea.

Thunder Burger is an upscale burger spot and the menu, decor, and atmosphere reflect that. Although they're known for their burgers, there were a good amount of other sandwich and entree options. I made my own burger combo w/bacon, pepper jack, and bbq sauce. So good! I had the sweet potato fries as my side and personally liked them better than the regular ones. I was also a big fan of the ginger aioli served with them. Others at our table had the pig in a cow suit burger, crabcake sliders, and fish & chips. Everyone seemed happy with their choices.",

Tucked away next to Home Depot, this small mom n pop restaurant serves up some great fingers and sides with their own twist on the dipping sauces. You pick from 1 of 3 kinds of fingers - baked, fried or grilled (hence the name BFG and yea I just figured that out). The food is resonably prices and for $7 I was impressed at the amount and quality of the food I got.  The side of choice seems to be baked mac and cheese which along any cheese-lover's dream come True. Custom made dipping sauces do not disappoint. The wasabi cream, and the BFG add a great kick of flavor to any panko crusted finger. The staff is super friendly, as first timers they were able to walk us through the menu and had their own recommendations. This spot is defitnely worth checking out if you're in the area.

    "text": "BFG definitely knows their chicken!!!!  After months of eying this place, we finally made it for a spur of the moment lunch. We wanted to actually stop by on Sunday, but thanks to Yelp, it told us that they were closed. I made my fiance meet me up at BFG's for lunch today. It was definitely worth the drive and being late for work.  I walked in and #1 combo caught my eye....the mac and cheese sold me. The fiance ordered the #2 combo.   Service was pretty awesome. One of the owners noticed that we were newbies to BFG's and took the time to explain to us what the different selections of chicken were. He also came back repeatedly to check on how we were doing. For a \"fast\" food joint, that's some pretty dang good service.   For the food, I definitely did not go wrong with the #1. The baked chicken was so tender and juicy, it makes my mouth water thinking about it. It was seasoned with a rotisserie spice and baked. Also, the fact that it's juicy white meat wins them the 5 stars. I am not a dark meat fan and for those dark meat lovers, this white chicken will have you fooled. I liked that you could choose the different sauces although I ate most of my chicken without sauce. Mac and cheese was definitely cheesy. I'm a cheese whore, so this definitely met my standards. I was able to try the fried chicken and it was tender and juicy inside. I do think I prefer the baked chicken over the fried chicken though BUT that's just MY opinion.   Overall, the chicken is very delicious and anyone who hasn't tried this place is missing out. We definitely will be back for more baked and fried goodness. OH and it helps that they have a stamp card.....benefits of going repeatedly...I'll take a free meal anytime.",

Never really cleaning anything, just wiping over and over the scum. Food was ok. Pleasant greetings by staff. Ordered grilled Chicken, grilled veggies and the Mac and cheese. All fairly good. Chicken nachos however were not good. Did not match menu pic, and chopped up, pre made chicken, beans  and ingredients mixed together, and liquid Cheese over it. Not going back.  Filthy front door grabs with coating all worn off.",

    "text": "Why has it taking me SO long too get me some BFG? Thankfully I cam say finally got me some. Sure so many reviews not sure much more could add but think every great establishment can always use another great review! It all starts with the customer service and the personnel touch both co owners show from the minute you walk into BFG. It was my first visit so looking at the menu little confusing but he did awesome job of explaining everything too me. Very clear, friendly, and understanding manner. Each step you get choice way chicken cooked, different sauces (thinking just get one; my surprise get two choices!!!), and the sides. Not just one option but few options on the sauces and sides. If get the combo comes with garlic bread. I needed too add honesty earlier because I was looking too try as much things being my first time. He told me comes with the garlic bread since going too order one on the side. Little things or sense of personnel touch gets lost in restaurants. They have stamp card too. Woot! Woot! More reason too keep coming back for more.  The chicken strips LOVE the breading anything with panko winnah. It such cleaner breading for any protein, just lighter and crisper breading outside. The meat is perfectly cooked, moist, and juicy on the inside. The sauces Wow so many too choose from need too got back try more. I had the honey mustard and the BFG. I fan of both. The sides looking at other customers going fries but it looked too good pass up. I was not disappointed. You would think fast food type of chain thinking mac and cheese. Not sure. The mac and cheese was da bomb. It was rich with the cheddar flavor, creamy, the pasta cooked al dente, and the cheese melted top it off was just perfect topping. All this for under ten dollar if that not steal of deal not sure what else there is in life.   I went for lunch talk about packed. I had too wait too get place too sit down. It soooo worth the wait. They have couple tables on the outside too. I really like the artwork on the side once you walk in. It has personality of its own cartoonist style but on point too the theme of the restaurant. If never been too BFG or enjoy fried chicken strip must stop in Vegas.",

The customer service was excellent the cashier explained the menu, took my order, and was very friendly. Even offered a water cup while I waited.  I ordered the 4 piece meal  4 tenders (I chose fried)  1 side (I chose mac and cheese)  2 sauces of your choice (ranch and their house sauce)  And toasted garlic bread.  Fried tenders 2/5 stars they seemed way over cooked when I saw the lady box them up but it was from a distance so I wasn't 100% sure. But when I got home..definitely over cooked. Tenders without any sauce just was bland.   mac and cheese 1/5 stars Very boring mac and cheese, tasted like the box kind and they just put shredded cheese on top to melt it.   Ranch 3 stars,  I'm a huge ranch lover so I'm picky and their ranch was decent.   House sauce 2 stars I guess everyone now has their version of 'came sauce' but I didnt care for it, to tangy.   toasted garlic bread 4 stars  It was hot and fresh grilled to perfection. I hate to say...the bread was the only thing I actually enjoyed and would eat again.",

After we arrived there were a lot more people coming in to order food. Now we know why   Probably by far one of the best fried chicken I've ever had.  Ordered both the grilled and fried  Fried chicken retained its juiciness and the panko fried chicken was nothing I've ever had before.  Crunchy yet melts in your mouth.  Lots of different sauces to choose from.  I recommend the sweet chili.   The grilled chicken was delicious as well.  Wrapped in aluminum foil reminded me of backyard bbq. Very tasty and juicy.   Wish this place is closer to my home. But will just have to visit when we come to Vegas again.   Highly highly recommend !!!",

    "text": "This was one of my favorite spots in town, slightly overpriced, but worth it as a treat. They moved inside of the Inn Zone on Rainbow and Westcliff and that alone I was not impressed with. I don't want to have to go into a bar to get my food. But I had ordered online before I realized they had moved and I ordered a lot so I committed.   Family meal with grilled, baked, and fried strips. The only ones I had a problem with were the grilled, they were over cooked. I could tell they would have been great had they been cooked properly, really nicely flavored etc. But I couldn't believe how charred they were, I wouldn't have served those, especially since it was an online order, so they had time to correct that.   I got fries, mac n cheese, and veggies. They changed the fries from thin fries to thicker steak fries, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Very tasty. Mac n cheese was ok. It always tastes a little empty to me so I add the cheese dipping sauce to make it a bit more robust.   Ordered a funnel cake with whip cream and both chocolate and strawberry sauce. When I got there they still had to make the funnel cake so I was waiting 10 minutes. There was no whip cream. I didn't eat it but my partner and kid enjoyed it.   Now the saddest thing about my visit...I have to SND JUST for the thai tea several times and this is the worst thai tea I've ever had, let alone that they've ever made. The color was a really pale orange, like it was more cream than tea, and there were a lot of tea leaves floating in it, leaving me to think that they stretched what little they had left in the pitcher to try and make 2 drinks. I was really disappointed, they were not drinkable at all.   Overall, I'm not likely to visit as often as I did before with the location change, the cooking quality, and the thai tea all being a down grade. Nothing against the bar, it's a really decent bar with a cool layout, but if I wanted to eat in a bar, I'd have gone to a bar. I use to bring my kid and nephews to SND, and I'd have regular dates with my GF's and mom there and now that is very unlikely to happen in the future. May to go order again sometime because it was so good before and they may just be having growing pains...I also don't think I got any point for my visit because I ordered online and I don't think they entered my PTN and I spent nearly $50, disappointed in that too.",

They are known for their fried chicken, but I wanted to be difficult and try all of their different types of chicken: fried, baked, and grilled. All were great but the fried was the best! It's may also be due to the fact that I wanted to be bad after doing a lap in the pool lol. They use tempura batter to fry the chicken. You get a nice crunch with every bite you take. You can see the grill marks on the grilled and it's good too. The baked chicken was juicy! So I love em all! The baked mac n cheese was really good too. The slightly burnt top layer of cheese and the ooey gooey inside made it great!   There's also different sauces you can pick. My personal favorite is the wasabi, but I like wasabi too. It's not overpowering where your eyes would water, however, it's a pretty good kick! So be careful and try at your own risk. The house sauce was explained to me as thousand island but it kinda tastes like ketchup mixed with mayo we call that fry sauce in Utah!",

The food looked so good when it came out that I completely forgot to take a picture... so unlike me! They use panko bread crumbs on their fried tenders.  Oh, did I mention you can get your tenders done 3 ways? Fried, grilled, or baked! This place took the Raising Canes idea and elevated it.  That breading on the tenders is so flaky and crispy without feeling greasy.  I tried mine with buffalo sauce and ranch.  I'm not sure if the ranch is made in house, but it didn't look or taste pre-packaged... always a plus! The toast was too small for my taste.  I was left wanting some more!  Now don't let the look of the restaurant faze you.  The decor could use some work but the food is great.  The tables are small, sitting a maximum of 4 so keep that in mind when dining with a crowd.  The staff was very helpful, taking the time to explain the menu and how to order.  The wait time was around 10 minutes for the food.  Overall, great food, nice portions, good service, and fair prices.",

Kudos to Matt for always greeting guests with a smile and taking pride in the place to keep it going without a hitch.  My order never changes. 2 fried strips, 2 grilled. Barbecue and Wasabi Cream sauce.  Fries and that signature mozzarella crusted Mac & Cheese. You cannot lose with any of the above. Idk what the grilled strips are marinated in, but they're always so juicy & flavorful. The bonus garlic bread is perfect for scraping the rest of your mac sauce off the sides too.  My only gripe is that prices have risen over the years (kind of expected), but no drinks come with the combos anymore. Not gonna stop me from coming, but I'd love an included orange soda.",

It takes a lot to have me unimpressed, but I'll let the photo of my meal speak for me.   I ordered the TWO STRIP MEAL COMBO. (about $5.00) This comes with 2 chicken strips, 1 side, 1 sauce... and I decided to go with the grilled chicken, baked mac & cheese, and sweet chili sauce.  Sigh. Please analyze the photo. I received a strip and a half at best -- definitely not two. Not only that, they were more like shards of chicken, not strips at all. How was this even considered a meal? This is more like a snack...  I'll give an extra star for the baked mac & cheese, which was surprisingly good. At the end of the day, I wouldn't say this is \"worth\" the money by any means though. My coworker got the 4 strip combo and for almost double the price, the quantity was not impressive either.   Oh. Plus the grilled chicken was supposed to have a \"asian marinade and honey glaze?\" No. Not really. Did we get a bad batch? We both agreed it was bland and very lackluster in taste. Same with the sauces we chose... nothing worth mentioning.   Will we return? Nah, we'll skip on strip n' dip...",

    "text": "If you want plain, fried chicken strips, you gotta try this place. I have to imagine that location is the only thing that has people convinced that raising cane is the best bang for their buck. The breading here reminds me of what you find on katsu, just a light amount of panko crumbs. The chicken to breading ratio is the best I've found outside of a sit down restaurant. And the sides are great.   The mac and cheese is super popular and if you like mac and cheese, I'm sure you'll like theirs. If you want fries, they'll give you way more fries than one person should consume. And the fries walk the line between crispy outside and soft inside. The grilled veggies are actually better than a lot of the veggies you'd get at a sit down restaurant.   I haven't tried all the sauces but I tend to get honey mustard every time. Don't over think it with the sauces. Get what you know you like. The tenders are the star here.   Overall, there's a lot of sit down restaurants with good chicken tenders. If I were to make a best chicken tenders of las Vegas list, it would probably include a lot of dive bars and single $ restaurants because, chicken-wise, you'd likely get more bang for your buck there. But if you're in a hurry and in the mood. Get ya self some strip n dip.",

    "text": "Honestly, I wasn't expecting much. A fellow Yelper recommended this place and I thought, how good could a chicken strip joint be? Well gadzooks was this place off the heezy.   The service here was as impressive as the food itself. We were greeted by a nice gentleman who asked if this was our first time in. We said yes and he immediately asked if it was from Yelp reviews (nice!). Obviously he follows whats going on in the Yelp community. He gave us some details on the many dipping sauces they have and checked on us twice throughout our meal. There are sit down restaurants that don't do this!   I never knew that selecting dipping sauces for strips could be so stressful. With the combo meals you get to choose two sauces (which is more than enough). I went with BBQ & the BFG sauce, my wife with the Ranch & Wasabi sauce. They have several sauces to choose from, next time I'll definitely try something different (these were great, but variety is the spice of life).  Now the chicken strips deserve a paragraph dedicated all to themselves. We made the mistake of both getting the Fried Chicken Strips. Next time we will mix it up and each get a B-F or G (not the same). For a whopping $5.75, yes, fie dollar an sevety fie cent, you get 4 chicken strips, a side, a piece of garlic bread, and a frosty coca-cola beverage. For rizzle. It's a glorious deal. When it came to sides there was no other option as they offered homemade baked Mac N' Cheese. Schweeet! Topped with mozzarella cheese it was ooeeey and gooey, two things M&C should always be. Back to the strips though. Their not your atypical fried chicken strips. They use panko bread crumbs which is a HUGE bonus in my book. They weren't drenched in grease. In fact after eating them I didn't feel that heavy sadness that normal chicken strips cause. The chicken was so moist and juicy it was actually dripping. The bread crumbs weren't overwhelming, but just enough to get the perfect amount of crunch in every bite. I can only imagine how awesome the Baked & Grilled strips are. A definite must next time. Key words are next time. We will be back. This place is rad!   Go out of your way to try BFG Chicken Strips, I don't think you will be disappointed.",

I created a survey, in which every single taste bud agreed to \"yum\" after my first bite. I had a mini chem lab at my table(two ramekins of sauces)where I mixed my wasabi sauce with the ranch.

The husband ordered the #1- four baked chicken strips, baked mac & cheese, two sauces (ranch & BBQ), garlic bread and a coke.  I had the special- Chicken Nachos.  I am on the once a week Taco Bell Nacho Bell Grande kick for the past month. (don't ask me why!  they just taste so good!) and these chicken nachos kicked its ass.  Chips, cheese, chicken, pico, sour cream, beans, scallions... delicious!  The husband liked his combo #1 and I also liked his mac & cheese.  Thank god he didn't eat it all and I get to have lunch off of it tomorrow! :)  I think it was the owner, Jin, who was very attentive and walked around to the tables to make sure that everyone was taken care of.

Although I was basically trying to eat \"healthy\", I tried the grilled, fried, and baked strips (I did it for Yelp - how can I rate a place without trying it all?)! I'm with Ann Marie - the grilled were actually my favorite. They put just enough glaze on them to give them flavor without being overpowering. They were grilled to order (guy threw them on the grill right when I placed my order!) and were so delicious.   Baked wasn't all that special, but fried were awesome ! No idea how they aren't greasy ? Panko ..mmmm.. so light, so fresh, and so \"not fried\" tasting. Love it !   I was thrilled to death to get 2 skewers of fresh delicious veggies with my chicken (green peppers, onions, tomatoes - yum!). I also tried a plethora of sauces. For you wasabe peeps, you'll love that wasabe cream sauce. My coworker was very pleased to find liquid cheese (like that kind that put on nachos at ballparks!), but I couldn't stop eating the BFG house sauce. It kinda reminds me of In-n-out special sauce, but yummier.   It's a simple concept, but executed well. A good value, healthy, and delicious !",

We were going to take our food to-go as BFG closes at 8pm, but the owner Jin was soo nice and understanding, he still let us eat-in. I mean the hospitality was AMAZING...and so was the food! Chicken strips can be easy to dry out, if not done right, but man...whether it was fried or baked these strips were always moist and seasoned just right. My boyfriend loved the fried because he loves panko breaded chicken :)  The mac n cheese....ohhh gooey cheesy goodness. Actually baked in the oven.  well, long story short, we were in town for less than 48 hours and we managed to come back and eat here twice! Thats how good it was. It was the best $6 meal I'd had for as far back as I can remember...  The simplicity of the meals is what makes this place best...The chicken is really the star here. Plus, the portions are perfect.  Fantastic food at a fantastic price...oh it was AWESOME.  Thanks Jin! Next time were in town, we'll be back  :D",

You can select from a multitude of sauces, from the standard bbq, teriyaki to their wonderful wasabi. For sides, the mac n cheese is great, but I try to stick with grilled veggies.   Service is great - staff is friendly and happy to answer any questions etc. After going a few times, a couple of the staff address me by name, which is a nice touch!   As a few yelpers already mentioned, space is a bit tight if it gets busy, but that doesn't detract from the service and food.   Try 'em out, you won't be disappointed.",

Not one to dwell on the negatives though, the mac and cheese was delicious as was the side of chicken nachos that were on sale that day.  The owner was friendly and made sure that service was great.  Last but not least, there's definitely a good selection of sauces, so if something is not to your liking, next time you can try a different one!  While I wasn't a fan of the Wasabi Sauce, the BFG sauce was particularly good.  I look forward to coming back and trying some of the different styles and sides at least.",

    "text": "I am still thinking about my experience at this place! Their food is to die for! My fiance and I took a trip to Vegas this past weekend and after a long 4 hour drive from Cali, we were definitely ready to eat some good food. I personally was craving mac n cheese so we decided to look on yelp and happened to come across Strip N Dip - we were sold by the pictures! As soon as we walked in, we were welcomed by friendly workers. I ordered the mac n cheese but wasn't sure if it would be enough food since it was a side dish, so I was on the fence about ordering the chicken nachos. The sweet lady at the cashier (didn't catch her name) recommended the chicken fries that were not on the menu. Let me just say I HIGHLY recommend the chicken fries to anyone who loves carne asada fries. I would seriously make the trip back out to Vegas from Cali JUST for those fries. The mac n cheese was incredible too (I'm very picky about my mac n cheese and I ended up buying a second serving in the same sitting). We were so impressed by the food here that we came back the next day and were lucky enough to meet Matt Boghos the owner! Matt was friendlier than can be and made us feel like he genuinely cared about the well being of his customers AND workers (which is very rare to find in this day and age). I even needed to charge my phone and he brought out a portable phone charger for me and treated us with a chocolate funnel cake (wow!) Matt was very humble and gracious, and it was very clear that he treated his workers well. My fiance and I were so impressed by the quality customer service here and will definitely be returning next time we're in Vegas! In fact, we hope Strip N Dip makes it's way out to California so that we can be regular customers! ;) Thank you Matt and all your friendly coworkers for making us feel so special!",

The baked wings are good, if you're looking for a lighter option, but the fried wings are seriously outstanding (they're panko covered).  The prices are reasonable, and the service is very good.  I love that there's a good selection of dipping sauces too.  You get two with every order, and I highly recommend making one of them the wasabi cream.  It's kind of like a less sweet honey mustard with a really good kick.  The macaroni & cheese, and garlic bread are awesome too. They had Thai iced coffee when I went, and that was delicious.  Great flavor, with just the right amount of sweetness.",

    "text": "Another great recommendation from fellow yelpers. Just an FYI this place was a little difficult to find in the shopping center since they are sort of at a weird angle. Came here during the lunch hour rush and yes it was pretty packed. I even had a hard time trying to find a seat. I ordered the number 2 with BFG and wasabi sauces. The chicken was really moist especially considering the fact it was baked. Also, nicely seasoned. The mac n cheese was absolutely amazing.  Gooey texture, while not being too overwhelmingly cheesey. Although I would of liked it more of there was some crunchy texture on top like crumbled crackers or something?  It actually came out piping hot, which I loved. The sauces were great as well especially since I'm a sauce kinda guy. BFG definitely beats Canes. I can't wait to come back and try the fried chicken strips. Bravo BFG Chicken Strips, you shall be seeing more of me!",

The fried chicken strips are like katsu chicken, breaded with panko.  While expertly cooked and juicy, I will admit I am still more of a fan of Chick and Benny's \"barely there\" breading on their chicken strips.  The breading on these are a little too thick for me.  I do find these on the same level as Raising Cane's.  But what BFG does better than the other chicken strip establishments in Vegas are the dipping sauces, which are pretty spectacular.  The hype on the wasabi cream sauce is completely True - it really is that good.  They also do a really good veggie skewer - and veggies usually aren't cooked this well.  But the chicken nachos, while tasty, was so rich and greasy from the cheese that I got a really horrible tummy ache the rest of the day.  Really wish they would put actual real cheese on these.  They are worth a try if you live in this part of town, and the owners are really nice.  Hopefully I will go back and try their baked and grilled chicken and be able to update this review.",

    "text": "\"Hey there, random Yelper that doesn't live in Las Vegas. This business is a chicken strip joint next to a Home Depot about 8 miles away from the Strip. Tell me why I should go here.\"  Okay, I will.  1. Let's face it; people of all ages love chicken strips. I love chicken strips. My husband loves chicken strips. If you love chicken strips, you should come here. 2. We had them baked and fried. Both styles of chicken were super juicy and flavorful, even without the sauce. 3. Oh yes, their sauces. We tried the honey mustard and sweet chili sauces. The honey mustard was a perfect balance of sweet and savory, and the sweet chili wasn't the cloyingly sweet sauce you might find elsewhere.  4. THE MAC AND CHEESE. It's as good as everyone else says it is. I almost wanted a second tin, but decided that it was the perfect amount. 5. Service. Wow. The cashier was very friendly, asked us how we found out about them (Yelp!), checked on us every so often, and thanked us for coming all the way out there. 6. They have a freestyle Coke machine. Win! 7. The prices are very affordable for fast, yet fresh and tasty food.  So if you're in Vegas, and you have a car (or are willing to pay the cab fare), make the trip to this little place. It'll be worth it.",

    "text": "I like Raising Cane's, its close to school and home, drive thru available, always hot, and the toast.. sometimes I go there just for the toast, but thats the problem. I can't be going to my chicken finger spot and only looking forward to the toast.   Nooooow... lets pretend I am married to Raising Canes then.. BFG would be my mistress, cheap, hidden, ultra friendly, gives more than receives, and satisfies. Since I've cheated it would only be fair that I compare my lover and my new mistress.   Raising Cane's Box Combo (6.89) versus BFG anything (5.75).   The drink - Both locations offer similar drinks, coke, diet coke, orange fanta, sprite, and etc.. so thats a tie .   The dip - Canes has ketchup and that brown gravy cane's sauce. BFG has 8 dipping sauces (guessing here), from a range of sweet honey mustard to the wassabi cream that brings a little spice to your life. My mathematical logarithms are not so good contrary to stereotypical beliefs but I know that BFG sauces (insert greater than sign) Cane's.    The side - At Cane's you can only get crinkled fries, a little cup of cole slaw, the delicious toast and... thats it. BFG offers you baked mac and cheese, vegetable skewers, garlic bread from a baguette and shoe string fries. If it wasn't for Cane's having that beautiful master piece of toast then they would have been completely dominated instead of mostly dominated by BFG.   EL POLLO (CHICKEN) - Cane's crispy chicken reminds me of what any other place that offers fried chicken strips would be like, but BFG's fried chicken is more.. homey, its a mostly unified and equally crispy deep fry of moist addicting chicken. BFG other offerings are grilled and baked, my favorite, which is seasoned and juicy. Sorry Cane's but you gave me no choice (literally) thus checkmate by BFG.   Oh there is also a grilled chicken salad which I have yet to try since I am not too fond of salads.  It is a bit difficult to find it you aren't familiar with the area, which is somewhat fine for me since its my secret mistress anyways. I also would like to see some more tables, seems to have a lot of free space in the little shop.",

The handsome cashier walked around the tables asking if everyone was ok and enjoying themselves, and also cleaning up. As he walked by me, he asks me by name if everything is ok. He remembered my name from the order. He said \"You forgot an important part of the meal\" and brought me napkins I had forgotten. Now talk about customer service!  I was already wanting to visit this place again just by that humble moment lol.   The food was hot and delicious.

I even rode my bike there one day to have lunch and I was mortified when they were closed on mondays so I ate at port a subs across the street in misery.    Be warned I am going to make a comparison to canes, I fell like it's fair because they are obviously copying them a bit, which is okay with me.     So I give strips themselves like 3 stars maybe 2, I just love canes so much and I always compare everything to them.  When you get down to the nitty gritty the food is better at canes, I like the batter better and the sauce is awesome.  BFGs panco breading just dosen't do it for me and the chicken isn't as tender, it does however come out fresh, crispy, and not greasy.  I think at BFG they cut strips out of breasts instead of using chicken tenders and this is probably part of the culprit. The garlic toast is small but tasty, canes delicious texas toast is better still as well as their fries.    Now there is a lot of redeeming points this place has, so many I have to make a list;  *Healthy versions, but the baked kind of sucked, the grilled was decent  *Many many sauces, some better that others  *Pretty delicious mac and cheese  *Service, AMAZING, seriously when I left I felt like the owner was my BFF  *Dirt cheap  I struggled on whether to give this place 3 or 4 stars.  Here is the breakdown  Strips 2.5 stars  Other food 4 stars  Service 5.5 stars  Value 5 Stars  So that is an average of 4.25 stars so 4 it gets I guess, for some reason I still want to give them 3.",

Their chicken strips looked and tasted panko-encrusted (japanese bread crumbs)...and that- folks, is what sets them apart from the rest.  Sounds basic enough, but its genius in the most simplistic form.  The chicken is moist, the breading is crisp, the dips are fantasmo. (you get your choice of 2)  Their mac n cheese is a mentionable, especially if you like yours baked.  Be careful though, it's extremely hot when it comes out.  They also serve weekly specials, and my friend ordered the bibimbap.  A Korean dish made up of chicken, vegetables, rice, eggs, and a chili sauce.  Each ingredient in bibimbap is separated and pretty at first glance, but you'll have to mix it up and ruin the picture in order to eat it correctly.  Their bibimbap is pretty decent.    The service?  Awesome.  Jin was taking orders at the cashier, and upon encounter, we were fast friends.  By the time he came around to each table to check on the customers (provided they weren't too busy) we were BFF's.  He'll make you feel special.  He'll give you stickers.  He'll dance for you.  (ok so he didn't dance but I bet he would if you asked).  So now when my friend asks me if I wanna go to \"The Strip\" I'll be thinkin BFG.  And Jin.  And Tin.  And Sister Tin.  And 2 other Sister Tin's who slave in the back preppin stuff.  \"Tin is the cook who makes your stomach happy.  Jin is the one who gives your face wrinkles\" - Jin",

    "text": "Ok, I went here today after reading the reviews.  I know many people say stuff like \"it is just chicken strips\" and so on.  My thing is this...when I review a restaurant, it is comparable to its peers, not every restaurant ever.  I do not put E by Jose Andres, and Cuginos Italian Deli in the same category, even though I enjoy them both.  Both are awesome and I give both 5 stars, but that is not to say they are the same.  My 5 stars for BFG is in the sense that among similar type restaurants, it is excellent.  The staff working the counter were excellent here.  He guy at the counter knew most of the people who came in by name and was very friendly and engaging with them.  When I got to the counter, he was very friendly and welcoming.  Definitely a good atmosphere.  The menu is simple.  3 types of strips..Bakes Fried Grilled.  A few sides and garlic bread.  Thats it.  I ordered some of each type for a total of 8 strips and got it with a side of grilled vegetables, a drink and a piece of garlic bread for a little under $10.  The grilled vegetables were simple, yet very good.  I enjoy getting 2 skewers of grilled veggies, even if they are just tomato, onions and zucchini.  A simple, healthy dish with a good flavor.  The garlic bread had pieces of real garlic on top, which was nice.  It had a good strong garlic flavor, yet did not feel super buttery or greasy like some garlic bread can be.  The strips were a mixed bag.  The baked strips were very plain.  They were not bad, but they did not taste like anything special.  They had some seasoning on them and tasted simple.  I would not get them again.    The fried strips were very tasty.  They did not feel greasy at all, and had a very delicious panko breading on them.  They were very juicy inside and had an excellent flavor, rather than just tasting like fried garbage like a lot of chicken strips do.   The grilled strips were also very tasty.  They had a little marinade in them which gave them a nice flavor, and were very juicy as well.  No dried out strips at all, quite the opposite.  Despite the fact that the baked strips were subpar, the other parts were very good in all respects and the service was very good.  They even said goodbye to me by name when I walked out.  Very customer oriented attitude here it seems, along with a simple, inexpensive menu that offers very easy and good lunch fare.",

Even if the food sucked, (which is doesn't) I would come back just to be treated the way they treat their customers.   I love the concept of the Baked Fried or Grilled. I got the Baked and Fried and I definitely will be back to try the grilled. The mac & cheese is by far the best I have had in a looong time.  Great place for something quick to eat.

    "text": "If you're a chicken wing, you better start lookin' for a new job. Maybe, you can find a job as a door stop or stand-in food on a local tv shoot, but I wouldn't plan on staying in the real food business for too long because personally I'd much rather have one of the tasty strips from BFG.   Of course, the fact that I have never enjoyed foods that still have bones helps my appreciation for a fine chicken strip, but I am confident most anyone would devour these treats. First, props for a simple, creative concept: baked, fried, or grilled chicken strips with matching sides. If you want baked, you can get the combo with baked mac 'n' cheese; fried comes with french fries, and grilled comes with grilled veggie skewers. You can mix it up too if you like, which we did.  We were in the mood for just a snack, so we shared a make our own combo with fried strips, mac 'n' cheese, tasty brewed iced tea, and we added some grilled veggie skewers. Everything is made to order, and comes out hot enough to burn your mouth, so be careful! Don't cram that delicious fried strip down your throat immediately. But, eventually, you will do just that. The breading reminded me of a delicious katsu, superior to most fried chicken I have sampled.  As for the sides, mac 'n' chese lovers rejoice, as the creation here is super cheesy. The cheeses might not be fancy, but it will put you in a comfort food coma for sure. For the healthier peeps, the grilled veggies are simple and delicious, too, with zucchini and onions and tomatoes. Fresh and served piping hot like everything else!   You get two sauces, and they have a wide selection of mostly homemade options. We went with honey mustard and buffalo, and here is my one teeny complaint: the buffalo was not very spicy. I definitely think they need at least one sauce that delivers a big heat punch! I will try sweet chili next time.   Still, that won't me prevent me from coming back. The owners are two young Asian blokes who are super personable and knew everyone's name. Regulars are always a good sign! The place is smallish and very casual with counter service, so don't get dressed up for your visit.  Creative, friendly, and tasty. I can't really think of what else you could want from a strip. Add spicy, and BFG may become the hottest local strip club. (I couldn't resist.)",

    "text": "So I visited the BFG establishment about a month ago and I have been agonizing ever since on how to find the words to describe how awesome this place is.  Had never heard of the joint before but based on the outstanding reviews I thought it deserved a visit.  My husband and I took my two nieces (ages 5 & 6) as anytime you ask what they want for dinner their response is chicken and french fries.  So they are essentially experts in this field.    Upon arrival we were greeted by Jin.  May I just say if everyone ran their restaurants with the friendliness and attentiveness as Jin the world would be a better place.  I thought to myself if the food is as great as the service this place is a godsend.  Finally, a nice easy menu - would you like baked, fried, or grilled?  Simple enough.  The meals come with (4) strips, a side, garlic bread, two dipping sauces, and a drink for the bargain basement cost under $6 dollars!  The kids menu comes with (2) strips, one side, small drink, and one dipping sauce.    We ordered the fried chicken strips meals (2) adults and (2) kids meals with macaroni & cheese.  Niece #1 decided to go rouge and ordered the french fries with her meal but after being \"forced\" to try the mac & cheese it was all over as she began sampling the mac & cheese from all of our plates.  Niece # 2 asked \"How did they get the macaronis to taste so good?\"  This is a question I am sure the gang at BFGs gets a lot.  For first timers I would recommend each getting a different preparation of the chickens to share... we had a rookie mistake that won't happen again.    I will keep it short and sweet.  This is the real deal Holyfield.  Visit BFG's.. tell them Dana sent you.     To Jin - how about we expand and open up a second location on our side of town ... or perhaps a food truck?  =)",

I got the honey mustard and ranch sauce, and the sweet chili and their sauce, can't remember the name, just that it tasted like thousand island.  Let me start from not so good to yummmo!  The mac n cheese....okay so to me it tastes like blue box kraft just baked with cheese on top.  Nothing to write home about.  The sauces we tried were good.  My fave was ranch and honey mustard.  Will try the Wasabi next tho.  Now, I will write home about the chicken strips!  Soooo gooood!   They are breaded with panko crumbs and fried.  It's not heavy or greasy, and they go perfectly with the dips.  The other good thing I was surprised about was the garlic bread.  Very tasty.  They have a loyalty program you can join, and will get free food on your birthday.  I would recommend this place minus the mac.",

I used to be a huge canes fan but the last few times I've gone it's been gross! sorry not sorry...skimpy on the size of the strips...sometimes overcooked, just all bad for the price I'm paying!!  so I was in NEED of a new chicken strip place & saw that strip n dip had pretty good reviews on Yelp and it just looked delicious so had to give it a shot..right? anyway...  the guy went over all the combos & options they have & it's definitely worth it for the price! on the picture the strips look small but they are HUGE! I ordered the 6 piece thinking it wasn't going to be enough...it was more than enough!  Plus your 1 side, I got the baked mac & cheese OH MY GAWDDDDD it was amazing...like it was really good!  The strips are also delicious! & you get to choose 3 sauces (you can mix & match)   so overall really great deal for $9  (I don't really enjoy garlic bread anyway. I wouldn't really eat it at canes either so I have nothing to say about that really)   ALSO THIS PLACE HAS THAI TEA  I know super random but I love thai tea so how could I say something bad about that?   great combinations yummy food great prices 5/5 stars  WILL BE COMING BACK",

    "text": "I think I am in love!!!  After hearing about BFG Chicken Strips for months through the grapevine, I was finally able to get over there today and check this joint out.  And boy was I a happy camper once I got my delicious lunch!  As the name states, you can get chicken strips baked, fried, or grilled.  I went for fried because is there really a choice when fried is an option?  So I ordered the 4 piece combo and went for the mac n' cheese as a side.  I was with my mom who ordered the same except went for the fries, so I got to sample both.    The mac n' cheese, as stated in so many other reviews, is simply amazing!  It was cheesy heaven with a bit of pasta thrown in to make it easier to eat.  Yummy!  The fries were right on as well.  Great crispy fries without being too crunchy.  They also have grilled veggies, but if it's healthy, I never get it, so I can't comment on that side option.  A great addition to the food were the numerous dipping sauce choices.  I love dipping stuff into other stuff. The more dipping options I have, the better!  I heart condiments.  With that being said, BFG has 9 sauces to pick from to dip your delicious chicken into.  We went with the BFG, BBQ, Honey Mustard, and Ranch sauces.  All were good but I do have to say the BFG sauce really complimented the chicken nicely.  As for the Honey Mustard, they must put crack in it, because I am addicted.  I don't even need to dip anything in it because I think I would drink it, if I could.  I'm a classy chick, can't you tell?  So yes, BFG Chicken Strips is a great hole in the wall place.  If you are in the area or love good chicken fingers, go check them out.",

I ordered my food to go, 4 baked chicken strips, mac 'n cheese, 1 BBQ sauce and 1 Honey Mustard. A drink is NOT included with the meal, when places do not include drinks...I opt for the free water. Total was about $7 and some change.  I got my food to go, went to my car to eat and noticed they gave me the wrong meal. Went back inside and they realized their mistake, switched it out, and I went back to my car. I received two honey mustards with my order and no BBQ.  The food was good for what it was, but I felt like a lard ass after I ate the extra cheesy mac 'n cheese. Next time, if there is a next time, I'll opt for the veggies.

I decided to go to this place after much self-debate on what to eat, and I am really REALLY glad I went here.  $4.95 gets you a kids' meal - 2 strips, 1 side, 1 sauce and a  16oz drink.  That's awesome, and is also the perfect size for me.  Of course they have larger, too!  The BFG sauce is what I tried and I definitely liked it a lot with their tender, well-coated fried chicken fingers.  Downright delicious.  For my side, I chose the baked macaroni and cheese... it is so creamy and southern that it filled a hole I didn't even know I had from leaving Texas.  While the food is great, the customer service is on the same par.  Interactive, friendly, helpful but not to the point of invading your space.  They make it a point to remember your name and go above and  beyond.  Being in fanatical customer service myself, this gets crazy points in my book!  For a future work lunch, I will probably try and convince them to cater from this place.  Yum!",

Ordered the Fried, Fries w/ Teri Sauce & Strip Sauce while the boyfriend opted for Baked, Mac n Cheese w/ Wasabi Cream & Sweet Chili.   Chicken was moist & tender. Can't go wrong with panko breading either! Fries were crispy not soggy just how I like it. Pretty good portion for the Mac n Cheese too. Considering you have garlic bread to devour as well.   The sauces were all so good, it was like a game which one I'd dip into. As everyone here says, wasabi cream was the best. Immediate wasabi flavor but dissipates afterwards which I appreciate so it's not too overwhelming.  All in all, great experience! Can't wait to go back and try the other sauces! Lol",

I ordered the 4-piece combo: grilled chicken, a side of mac n cheese, garlic bread, and 2 sauces. I opted for the house dip and honey mustard.  Mac n cheese was crispy at the top, almost like they baked it. I loved it! So cheesy and delicious! The grilled chicken was pretty tasty and fit well with the sauces. The garlic bread was expected, just a small piece of bread with garlic butter flavoring. Nothing too special, but it was good to eat with the mac n cheese.  I also got a Thai Iced Coffee - very unique! As an avid coffee drinker, I think it's one of my top iced coffee drinks!  I'd say this is a healthier alternative to going to a fried chicken chain, the food is way more comforting! The workers are very nice and social, and made me feel very welcomed.

We met up with some friends here and were able to cobble together a table for 7 but otherwise, the restaurant is pretty small (and casual).    I decided to be healthier and get the grilled chicken strips while hubby went all out with the deep fried ones.  I have to admit, though mine were good (maybe a touch on the salty side given that you get sauces), hubby's were so fantastic, even without sauce!  Our favorite sauces were honey mustard and the spicy Asian sauce, combined with some good 'ole fashioned sriracha.    Who would have known chicken strips could be so wonderful?  The mac and cheese didn't hurt either - I can't remember the last time I finished and liked an entire serving of m&c.  Service was great and I love the name - somehow Vegas appropriate lol.",

    "text": "I love BFG's panko fried chicken strips! It reminds me of the fried seafood mix I used to eat at Osaka's in San Diego. They just fried up scallops and fake crab sticks instead....sorry back to the chicken! It was crispy and tender on the inside. I tried the Wasabi and the Honey Mustard sauce. I enjoyed the Honey Mustard more because it wasn't bitter like the Wasabi. I also loved the veggie kabobs which were full of flavor! I ordered the Mac and Cheese as an additional side but I couldn't finish it. It was creamy and cheesy but too salty for me. I just have a low tolerance to salt.  I liked the idea that you can come here with someone  who is health conscious aka my husband. You can totally order healthy items like grilled chicken and veggies. It's a great alternative to typical fast food places like KFC.",

    "text": "So BFG was created and owned by Jin and Tin who has now sold it to someone. Now, whenever ownership changes there is always a worry if it is for better or worse of the food and service. When a place that had a frontman bursting with personality that built a rapport with people, it's admittedly hard to not miss that.   I am however pleased that the food is just as good, tastes the same. I got my favorite like always - the perfectly crisp fried strips, grilled veggie skewers or fries, honey mustard and wasabi.   I like that the weekly specials like the hot chick and the nachos are just on the permanent menu instead of a weekly rotating special. No teriyaki bowl or bibimbap that I noticed being still on the menu. Sucks, teriyaki bowls here are great with the strips and I used to always order that.   Service is efficient. They're friendly and smiley enough, but I guess things will never be the same if people aren't as personable. I know, I know. I sound like I'm whining over something trivial...   Still, if you want some good basic comfort food chicken strips, this is where I go and you should too.",

Makes me so happy! Especially at a place where you expect it to be mediocre, if you were to judge it by the cover. Rashaud greeted us when we walked in, explained the menu, told us about the specials they had, all with a smile on his face! After we received our food, he made sure to check up on us, ask if everything tasted as it should & if we needed anything else. He was amazing, from the time we walked in & walked out! 5 stars for Rashaud! :)   P.S- the food was pretty good as well! would definitely come again.",

    "text": "We've ordered quite a bit of food from here because it's convenient and darned tasty. The Family Meals are a great way to feed a group. The chicken is golden panko breaded goodness.   The new owners have kept it consistent for awhile now and that's a good thing. The rewards system no longer constantly changes.   CONS: We've had the fries be soggy on a couple of large meals, so that kept us away for awhile. Smaller batches are always good. My biggest gripe is that the price of garlic bread and extra sauce, just like the rent, is too damned high.  If you are selling $45 worth of chicken, charging fiddy cent extra for less than two tablespoons of sauce is ridiculous. Ain't nobody got time for dat nor for paying half a buck for barely garlic butter bread when the whole loaf costs a buck.",

    "text": "For any chicken finger enthusiasts this place is a MUST! You have a choice of tempura-style or grilled chicken fingers with a choice of a side and sauces. For sides you have a choice of mac and cheese, fries or grilled veggies. My personal favorite is the grilled veggies which are zucchini, onion and tomato. They are incredibly fresh and a rather great compliment to the chicken fingers. For the fingers themselves, they are made of great tasting white meat but at the same time do not have much taste. The real magic is in the restaurant's choices of sauce. Depending on your meal, you can choose either two or three sauces from their menu of over 10 sauces. My absolute favorite is the sweet chili sauce.   If you're in the area and looking for a break from the conventional fast food chicken finger, give Strip N Dip a try!",

    "text": "Too often, many residents of Las Vegas swear on Raising Cane's as the number one destination for chicken fingers in the valley. No.  As far as I'm concerned, Strip n Dip simply has the best to offer from every aspect whatsoever, including the quality, the taste, the service, and even the value. I first went to this restaurant with a recommendation of a friend based on the Baked Macaroni and Cheese, and it surely didn't disappoint. Nice crispy edges, and extra cheddar inside meant the macaroni was scrumptious and baked to perfection. Some of my friends think it needs a bit more flavor, but I'm personally satisfied. Another side star are Strip N Dip's french fries, which are McDonald's-sized but with crisper edges and great flavor. But of course, how could I forget the chicken? Strip N Dip's chicken strips come in three options: fried, baked, and grilled. All, somehow, are great on their own merits. Personally, I (like others) prefer the fried strips, as their panko breading adds texture and flavor to the already great tasting meat. For those on a stricter diet, guests are given the option of baked strips or grilled strips. Baked strips come with a sort of red seasoning that gives the chicken a taste of its own, while grilled strips are left alone, making it a chicken canvass for many of Strip N Dip's great tasting sauces. The honey mustard is extremely high quality, and the wasabi is fantastic for any spice fans. I also had a Thai Tea which was pretty good, but kind of odd compared to the rest of the menu.  Strip n Dip also shines with its incredible service. Every employee is happy to be there and eager to learn if you're a new customer. They'll give you their own recommendations and ultimately make the experience that much more wonderful. The best thing? 6 strips, 2 sides, and a drink all can be had for under $10. Somewhat comparable to Cane's, but with chicken that actually has flavor. It's an awesome place and I can't wait to try their hot chicks!",

    "text": "in an attempt to look for fun, cheap, delicious food, i do recommend this place.  it's a place that consists of chicken strips B(aked)F(ried)(Grilled).    my introductory meal here was the grilled option with 4 grilled chicken strips and grilled veggies on skewers, with a side of perfectly toasted garlic bread and butter.  the meal comes with two sauces, and there are many to choose from - wasabi cream, honey mustard, BFG, etc.  the chicken is moist, there's really good baked mac 'n' cheese.  for the health conscious, there's salad, and of course, your choice of baked or grilled chicken versus fried. for the picky child or child-like eaters (like myself), the simplicity of the menu here is perfect.    if i can nominate for customer service of the year, this place deserves it.  the guy at the counter was nice and he even came to check up on us and engage in casual conversation, too (since we are from LA and are invading sin city for EDC).  i've never experienced service like that, and with that in mind, will always want me coming back for more...chicken.",

My fav is grilled combo-grilled chicken with skewered veggies + every combo comes with 2 dipping sauces- my fav's are wasabi cream, sweet chili, and honey mustard. They run an \"item of the week\" and if you catch the chicken nachos= awesome. Family owned, Jin the front man remembers everybody!! Super props",

The first strip which I tired was fried stip and it was ok. Then I bite into the second and it went down hill from here, the chicken had a weird texture to it,so I move on to the bake strips which were  very bland and the say texture issue. I took a bit of the Texas toasts and it was really buttery and crispy and last the mac cheese they use cheese wiz to mix the noodles up then top it off with mozz or chedder cheese I think! The topping of the cheese is the best part!! Who uses cheese wiz for mac cheese. The only reason I'm  giving them 3 starts is for the cool ass soda machine and the cool employee who help me out!",

And you get a good song that you would gladly listen to? Yeah kinda like that, no skipping. Just let it plaaaaay.  After we ordered, Jin (co-owner) asked for my name.  I thought it was just to call it out for the order, but no, he took a mental note and made conversation with us.  Even though we met just seconds ago, we talked like we were homies.  That's hella cool. Shout out to Jin! I got your back if anyone gives you problems homie! Lol. Anyways, he kept our drinks filled at all times.  As for the food, I enjoyed it like it was my last meal.  A fork and knife came with my 'Baked' order.  And the chicken was perfectly cooked, with the perfect seasonings.  It came with 'Baked' Mac n' cheese, and a slice of garlic toast. The Mac n cheese was good but tasted like it was missing something. Hmmm, butter. Yeah that'll do the trick. And probably cheddar cheese on top instead of mozzarella.  The sauce selection is real nice, cuz what if you don't want cane sauce or ketchup with your fingers!!!! their sauce called the BFG is really good and I recommend trying it.   I will be paying BFG alot more visits for the equal reason of the food being excellent and well prepared by Tin, and the super excellent attentive service provided by Jin!",

The breading is a very light panko mixture and it makes for some juicy chicken fingers. The sauces I'm still trying out, but the standouts are the BFG sauce, the teriyaki and the honey mustard. The accompanying garlic bread is consistently fresh. The mac and cheese comes out hot and gooey and tasting like homemade. It's a generous portion although it's so good I rarely leave any leftovers. My latest trip here was immediately following a 90 minute massage from the best foot spa and I must say it was a magical night! The price is perfect and there's never a long wait. The employees are overtly friendly and seem genuinely interested in you enjoying their establishment. What's not to love?",

Happened upon this place due to the reviews I saw on here and decided to give it a shot.  I'm glad I did!  I ordered the 4 piece strip meal, fried, along with the baked mac 'n cheese.  I'd like to consider myself somewhat of a mac 'n cheese expert, one of my favorite sides, and this macaroni was full of cheesy goodness.  Absolutely devoured it!  The strips were nicely breaded and fried to a nice golden crunch and both the dipping sauces I received, buffalo and honey mustard were quite good as well.    I wouldn't hesitate to come back and try some more when I'm back in town!",

Every order comes with garlic bread and your choice of 2 sauces out of 9. My choices were the BFG sauce and the honey mustard. Jin & Tin are an awesome team and great people. There wasn't a second that Jin wasn't serving us. And if he wasn't, he was having a chill conversation and getting to know us personally. I like when places call you by your name instead of a number.  Everything here is simple and delicious. And they always have specials like teriyaki bowls when I was there.

    "text": "This place was on my 'To Do List\" for a little while. Since I was in the neighborhood I decided to stop by today.  It's kind of difficult to see from the street, so the easiest way to describe the location is that it's in the shopping mall right next to the Home Depot....on the left side if you're facing Home Depot.  Before I entered, I looked on Yelp and saw that they had a Special Offer for $1.50 for Hot Chicks.....decided I would investigate further.  Since this was my 1st visit, I didn't know what a Hot Chick was and was pleased to find out that it was a Fried Chicken strip on a Hot Dog Bun w/Lettuce, Tomato, Onions, and your pick of sauce.  This sounded like a winner....so I ordered 2.....one with their BFG Sauce and the other with Honey Mustard.  For a side, I ordered Baked Mac 'n Cheese.  The restaurant is a small business owned and operated by a couple of friends and their family members.  While I waited for my food, we chatted it up a while.  They are genuinely nice people, which is a huge plus for me.  They asked each and every person who came into the joint what their first name was and called them by their first name when calling the order and saying goodbye....and it doesn't sound fake either.  After a few minutes my food was ready.  I decided to try the Hot Chick with the BFG Sauce first.  The proportion of Lettuce/Tomato/Onions was just right and the amount of Sauce on the Sandwich was just right as well.  The Chicken was moist and tasty....it wasn't greasy (bonus)....it was like a Chicken Strip Hot Dog....awesome!  The BFG Sauce is sort of like Thousand Island Dressing, but with a slightly different flavor to it....definitely worth a try.  While I was devouring the 1st Hot Chick, I took a few bites from the Mac 'n Cheese....it was gooey and Cheesy....it's making my mouth water just thinking about it.  The Mac 'n Cheese portion size is pretty good too for $1.50.  I then went for the 2nd Hot Chick....covered in Honey Mustard Sauce....again, it was explosion of awesome in my mouth!  The Honey Mustard wasn't too sweet and balanced the flavors of the Chicken and the other toppings.  Overall, it was a good day.....2 Hot Chicks & a Side of Mac 'n Cheese for around $5...isn't that every guy's dream?  Shh!!!  Don't tell my Wife!  Ha!  Will I return?  There are so many other options on the menu I want to try....Grilled Chicken, Baked Chicken, and the Fries...You bet I will!",

The sauces were perfect compliments to everything, there's a flavor for everyone. The chicken nachos were bomb! It was tasty without being overly done, like it was enough to eat the entire thing without being stuffed to the gills. Best thing is it's good value for your $.

The baked chicken is so savory, moist, and tender; a perfect choice for strips. The fried chicken has a great breading that still retains all of its moisture. The mac'n'cheese is so delicious, with real cheese piled on! Even the fries have a great flavor! They have one of those new coke machines with a bunch of flavors, plus: Thai iced coffee and Thai iced tea!!! Who does that? These wizards of culinary delights, apparently. Their sauce selections are a perfect accompaniment, with classics like ranch and buffalo backed up by swinging originals like wasabi cream, sweet chili, and even cheese! We didn't try their grilled chicken or grilled veggies, but I can only imagine their mouth-watering effect; I promise I will devour them next time I'm there dear Yelpers! The place has the professional, clean feel of a chain (with solid social media marketing and tech to boot); but it's a stand-alone local business! If you're in Vegas and ever thinking \"I'm hungry for fresh, original chicken\", then look no further! Stop on in, and tell them Gary sent you. They won't remember me, but they'll remember your enthusiasm for their awesome chicken, just like mine! Nom nom nom!",

Tin and Jin are the brains to this Asian influenced chicken joint. What's not to love of their fried chicken strips, fries, garlic bread AND a drink for $5.75. That's a steal in my book. The Panko crusted chicken tenders reminds me of a thick Chicken Katsu. The fries are insanely addictive with sweet chilli sauce and wasabi cream sauce so be careful! Also, I do appreciate how the fries remain crispy for extended an extended period of ESPN Sportscenter.   Next visit baked chicken and mac n cheese.",

(2) The homemade sauces are sooo good (love the buffalo) (3) The chicken is tasty (even baked!) (4) The grilled vegetables have a great flavor (5) It's crazy cheap!  Two combos: Fried with fries and baked with veggies, comes with garlic bread and two drinks = under $13!  I had baked but I tried the fried and both were excellent!  It was obvious that a lot of the customers were regulars.  In fact, Jin asked me if it was my first time since he didn't recognize me.  That kind of service goes a long way, especially in this town.  Will definitely return to BFG, and not just to see if Jin recognizes me next time!  :)",

Also very good.  The wasabi has a mild heat.  Nothing to be afraid of because it also has some sweet to it..  The Mac and Cheese ROCKS!!!!",

I like their simple menu, and I have to say that my favorite is the fried chicken strips because they are coated with Panko, which are Japanese style bread crumbs. I also love the baked Mac and cheese, which is always hot and creamy! The combos are reasonably priced, comes with the right amount of food, and includes a drink. They have nine different sauces to choose from, which is great!   What really stands out about this place is the customer service. Jin is just awesome! He is very friendly, talks to all of his customers, and tries to remember everyone by name. You have to admit that it is rare to see that level of service anywhere nowadays!   Don't forget your stamp card! Buy 10 combos, get one free! You can also check their website for weekly specials.",

It was an excellent lunch, made us feel like kiddos again during a long day of meetings.    2nd experience;  a month later we requested the same caterer however they were uber busy and could not deliver so we decided we would go to them.  They are located about 30 minutes away, but they were that good and worth it.  This time a order the fried chicken strips with the wasabi cream and honey mustard sauces with grilled veggies.  It again was DELISH!  So much, my colleague order some extra to take with him on the plane.    3rd experience; oh heck, I've been back more times now then I would admit to :-) yes they are that good!    Order their fried chicken strips with the wasabi cream sauce and the Mac-n-cheese then plan to spend an extra 10-20 minutes in the gym!!!  I'm looking forward to going back the next time I'm in Vegas.  I hope to see you there.",

I had the fried chicken today and grilled last time. Both good but I have to say the fried is better. I'll have to try the baked next time and some funnel cake. I wasn't a fan of the vegetables, they were a little soggy to me. The garlic toast is so good. They have one of the new coca cola electronic touch screen soda fountains. Cute little shop. They have outdoor seating as well.  During today's visit I used the Eat24 app to order my food. Something happened when it went through the computer and when I went to pick it up only half my order was there. The manager apologized several times and had my order fixed in under 3 minutes as well as offering me a large drink and extra chicken. Very professional and excellent customer service! They really want to make the customer happy and see us come back. Will definitely be back. Thanks!  They also offer student discounts!",

    "text": "Chicken strips, chicken sandwich... something chicken was what my husband and I were hankering for yesterday for lunch. Drive to St. George for Chik-Fil-A? Nah. Cane's? Hmm. Ah, so I consulted Yelp and up came Strip N Dip. I remember bookmarking this one awhile ago as BFG Chicken Strips. Apparently the restaurant has gone through some changes since then, and it had a stint where it was closed, but - it is back open and man, is it good.  The location is a little odd, tucked into a shopping center sandwiched between Albertsons and Home Depot. It is small, few tables and a bar, with a few tables for outdoor seating. But the inside is cool with vibrant posters and a digital menu reader board.   My husband and I both opted for the fried 4-strip meal with the baked mac and cheese. The mac and cheese reminded me of a little personal pizza sitting in my basket. When I dug in its ooey-gooeyness and delicious cheesiness was sublime! I think more people should put cheese over macaroni like they do.   As for the strips - absolutely perfectly done. Juicy and tender on the inside yet fried to a crispy, but not hard outside. The panko breading I really enjoyed, my husband said he would have rather had a normal batter-like outside like Cane's does. *shrugs* Dipping sauces - I went with the Strip Sauce, of course, had to try that one and it is very good and addicting. And I opted for the buffalo because I wanted a bit of heat. Both good, but next time I'm definitely going for that wasabi one.   The service was SO NICE! These guys are really trying hard to make customers feel very welcome. You could even say it is a familial vibe here.  If you like Cane's, you must try Strip N Dip. Just for an alternative because they are really doing chicken strips right.",

    "text": "So apparently I missed the era in which this place was a 5 star?! First visited this place last week and was quite impressed/pleased with everything?... Not sure why some of the low ratings. People need to understand costs are going up everywhere, hence, why business owners need to increase prices. \"If you no like, go to KFC!\" Simple as that.  Let's start with customer service: This lil family owned hole in the wall that is easily missed if you are not paying attention is on a fine mission to smother you with niceness! One of the workers held the door open for us as we walked in :-0 ...Oh-and as I walked in, I overheard her tell another customer if their experience eating there was not up to their expectations, she would \"take care of them\" at their next visit! That's a strong statement, Strip N Dip, we will hold you to your word! The cashier was extremely friendly and helpful in explaining their menu items and filling us in on what the popular picks were. The wait was not long and our food was delivered promptly.   Establishment: Took off a star because we did not have the option to eat at the restaurant due to overcrowding. Seating is very limited so we took our food to go. Maybe if the place was a little bigger, people would not be forced to take their food to go and have to experience a case of \"cold food.\" No bueno.  Food: The deep fried chicken strips were amaze-balls! Very tender and flavorful. The Mac & Cheese.......OMG, the Mac & Cheese......SO F'ing GOOD!!!!!!! (for a lack of better words.) Do not come here and NOT order the Mac & Cheese because you will miss out on the full experience. Also, a hot pick here is the nachos. Holy bejezus! These are addicting!   Honestly, for a first timer, I would recommend the nachos, Mac & Cheese and if room available, have the fried chicken strips. :-)",

I didn't get to try the bbq because the other 2 sauces were so good. The wasabi cream was amazing with the non greasy fried chicken strips. The strips were fresh, crispy and tasty. Not a trace of oil to be seen. Also, the honey mustard was the best honey mustard I've had.  The mac and cheese was a solid side. The melted cheese on top was a nice touch. Rounding out the combo was a nice slice of garlic bread. Strip and Dip has a Coke Freestyle machine which means I can get my favorite vanilla Coke. Yay!  I really like this business and they even have a loyalty program that links to your phone. I noticed the menu offered grilled vegetables and they're offering catering.",

We got here around 9:15pm at night and the place was pretty busy.  By the time we got our orders taken, however there were some free tables.  I ordered 4 grilled strips an the grilled veggies. I was disappointed that I was told that you could not mix n match grilled / baked / fried chicken. I wanted to try them all but wasn't allowed to, so I just chose the grilled.  My wife chose the 6 fried chicken strips with mac n cheese.  The sauces that we chose were: Chicken Strip Dip, Wasabi, Ranch, Teriyaki and Buffalo Sauce.    The Teriyaki was awesome.  My second favorite was Buffalo and third was Wasabi.  I was disappointed on the extra charge for sauces that are not included in your combo meal.  My wife also wanted to try the chicken nachos.  The nachos were good, they reminded me of Taco Bell nachos with chicken instead.  I like that they got the new soft drink machine where you can choose tons of combinations.  My killer combo is Diet Coke with Cherry in it.  The food was okay, I expected the serving size to be slightly larger.  The food took a LONG time to come out.  They make it to order.  We came starving and was just about out of backbone when the food finally came out.  One thing was that the music was so loud in the restaurant that I could barely hear the guy taking my order, let alone talk to my wife.  The customer service was AWESOME!  If we were ever around this place again, I'd give it another whirl... just turn the music down a little bit.",

    "text": "WINNER! WINNER! CHICKEN (STRIPS) DINNER!  Looks like Raising Cane's just might have some competition! When you think of chicken strips, what comes to mind is deep fried battered chicken strips. Traditionally, that's what has always been known.   But then this place turns it up a notch, actually two notches, not just by offering you FRIED, but also GRILLED and BAKED as well.   It's not just your typical battered fried, but they use PANKO breading, which makes it very crispy on the outside while it stays juicy on the inside.   At first I thought the GRILLED would be kind of dry, but with the first bite, I was pleasantly suprised at how tender and juicy it was with the taste of Asian marinade and honey.  Same goes for the BAKED. It has a wonderful rotisserie flavor to it.  As for the sides, you have BAKED MAC N CHEESE, FRENCH FRIES, and GRILLED VEGGIES. You can't go wrong with these selections but make sure at least one of your choices is the baked mac n cheese. Not only is it what you expect, but they also put MOZZARELLA on top of it!  Of course you gotta have a sauce to dip you chicken strips in so here's the lowdown. You get your choice of 9 sauces. (in alphabetical order)  1. Barbeque 2. BFG 3. Buffalo 4. Cheese  5. Honey Mustard 6. Ranch 7. Sweet Chili 8. Teriyaki 9. Wasabi Cream  These are all self explantory except for BFG and Wasabi Cream. The BFG is there secret signature sauce comparable to Raising Canes. The Wasabi Cream tastes just like a sweet, cream cheese type of sauce with just a little bit of spicy kick of wasabi.  Since this is the only location in existence, any time you are in the area, try to take advantage if you are close by. If you are gonna dine in be aware that they only have about 6 tables inside and about 3 tables outside. They are located to the left of Home Depot.  All in all, I would definitely go back and recommend this place to anybody. Service was nice and they get your food out to you pretty quick. The one only negative I can say is that the strips are just a tad bit small. If you are really hungry, you just might have to order extra strips or sides to compensate.   So what are you doing still reading this review? Go already! What are you, chicken? LOL.",

I've been coming to this place for about 2 years now and I must say I always have phenomenal service. The atmosphere is always on point. The staff is always super friendly.   Here's the thing that got me though. Today I went in because I had a free 4 meal ( btw get on those rewards people.) I noticed it was busy. A little busier than usual. I finally get to order and the gentlemen let's me know it might be a minute because him and the guy in the back are by themselves. Not a big deal, not going to lose sleep tonight over that.  Check this out ....I finally get my food....perfectly, PERFECTLY cooked. Crisp, crunchy, golden brown chicken strips. Delicious, golden , creamy baked Mac and cheese ( NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BURNT ) , then the garlic bread looks like homeboy just made it by hand himself back there.  You guys ...hopefully you know who you are because I forgot to ask for names...bad ass job. I know what that's like, and I know things get crazy sometimes. You kept your guys' cool, professionalism but most importantly food was absolutely fantastic. Thank you for yet again ANOTHER awesome experience.   Thanks for reading.",

Perhaps it's not too bad to get this once in a while but again it is quite pricey and out of the way (Rainbow & Sahara)  People say the mac and cheese is to die for so I guess you should get there.

The chicken can be prepared one of three ways (fried, grilled, baked) and I really liked the baked chicken strips. As for my dips, I'm a huge fan of SPICY, so naturally got the buffalo sauce and hot wasabi sauce. The buffalo sauce was my favorite. Loved dipping my strips!  For my sides, the individually baked mac n cheese was delicious, and the garlic bread was generously seasoned. I have no complaints about my meal. The 4pc option was filling enough for me, and I was pretty hungry. I'm just super impressed by how good this place is!",

    "text": "I just had Strip N Dip for the first time. I was on the fence about 3 or 4 stars... But I went with four stars for a few reasons:  1) their chicken strips are really freaking good. I got them fried, and they had like a light panko breading. I was impressed!   2) the sauces were also delicious. I got the buffalo, wasabi, and strip sauce. Strip sauce was pretty good but the other 2 were unbelievably good.   3) the fries were really good too. Nicely fried, as you would expect with such perfectly fried tenders!  4) they have the new coke machine where you can make any drink you want! The large cup for the soda was also the nicest cup I've gotten in a fast food place. I'll be keeping it and using it at home.   Now for the reasons it's not a five, and was even close to being knocked to a 3:  1) the place stunk like shit. No exaggeration. My fiance and I were looking forward to a casual sit down dinner, but we couldn't stand the smell for more than a minute or so. I asked the staff, and they said the place next door doesn't do their sewage sometimes so then the smell makes its way over to strip n dip. I get its out of their hands, but omg it was disgusting   2) the Mac and cheese was weak, like real weak. You know when you get excited about mac and cheese, and then it's tasteless? That's what this is. Tasteless. Very disappointed.   3) Value. Well, I'll maybe say I was neutral on this. I spent 20 bucks, one drink, a 6 piece meal and a 4 piece meal. Too much? Yes. However it was a bunch of food and we were stuffed.   I'll be back for the chicken fingers for sure, just hope the place doesn't force us to take out because of the smell",

Both Mr. B. and I  ordered ours fried. Since Im a fan of panko crusted anything this chicken strip was already a plus in my book. Chicken was juicy and flavorful.  The mac n cheese side was oozing comfort food, hot and cheesey.  My grilled veggies were good as well! Counter service staff was super friendly. The boss was there and True to the many reviews, he acknowledged and greeted almost every customer even though he was clearly busy.   All I got to say is that both Mr. B and I are happy we did check this place  out while we were in the area. BFG won me over and now Im a fan of chicken strips, at least the way they are made here!",

It had great reviews, so why not?  First, the service was out of this world! Matt was so nice and was incredibly sweet. He was passionate about the food he serves and proud. He should be! I ordered the chicken nachos and my boyfriend ordered the chicken sandwich with fries. My chicken nachos was so good, I finished the whole thing!!! I took a bite of the sandwich and I'm gonna have to say this.... I think it's better than canes. There! I said! The sauce is better too! Lastly, the funnel cake. Deep fried gooey crunchy goodness. I thought I would have to be rolled out of there from after all that.   This place is a small joint, I hope it succeeds and expands to great thing. Thank you Matt for making our first experience memorable. We will be back to try other things.",

We decided to try all the sauces, but the BBQ, because they don't make the BBQ in house. (They don't make the ranch either, but I like it with the buffalo sauce). The other sauces were as follows: Sweet chili - great Teriyaki - good Buffalo - good Wasabi - good  Cheese - good (they don't make this either) Strip sauce - my fav!!!  I order the 4 piece fried with a side of Mac and Cheese. The strip are crunchy with the Pablo breading and the sauces made them super yummy.   The Mac and Cheese is pretty good too.  They make it with a creamy cheese sauce like a velvetta, and then cover it with a cheesy topping to make it gooey and delish! Even the garlic bread was good.   We split a serving of the funnel cake with the strawberry and whipped cream on the side. Both of us agreed that it didn't need the toppings and it was perfect with just powdered sugar.   I even had leftover Mac and cheese, and I stuck it in the over for 10 min the next day and it was just as good as the first time.",

    "text": "(TL;DR - extra crispy and moist chicken fingers and a unique sauce selection for the sauce advocate. Wasabi cream is what sauce dreams are made of!)  As far as chicken fingers goes, this place is the place to be. I'm not often finding myself craving chicken fingers, but it's a simple and no-fuss type of meal.  We went with the 6 piece fried chicken finger combo with garlic bread, and added a side of fries, baked mac and cheese, and extra, extra sauce. The chicken fingers were simple, nicely seasoned, super crispy, and surprisingly moist inside. You can also opt for baked or grilled chicken and add vegetables for a lighter fare.  The side of fries was a heaping size. They topped off an entire to-go container. They were standard shoe string fries, crispy and simple. I loved dipping my fries in their sauces. Also, the baked mac and cheese was bubbling hot, comforting, and very cheesy. We enjoyed every cheesy bite.   My favorite thing about this place is definitely their sauces! They have a great variety of unique sauces. We tried the wasabi cream, honey mustard, and sweet chili. The wasabi cream and honey mustard were both delicious, but the wasabi cream is what dreams are made of! It had a sophisticated flavor, like it was from a classy upscale dining establishment. I dunked all of my fries and chicken into that sauce, it was incredible. On the other hand, I didn't care for the sweet chili too much. It tasted artificial and bottled to me, but my boyfriend enjoyed it.   Fast, easy, and cheap comfort food, plus friendly service! A good reason to stop in again to try their other sauces!",

Had the chicken nachos and I would say they were okay nothing to write home about but not bad. My children had the fried chicken strips which seem to be pretty good. I really enjoyed the Planko crust on their Fried Chicken. They also offer baked and grilled options as well. Overall not a bad experience. It's a little far from the house so I don't think we'll come often but I would eat here again. Also well priced.",

    "text": "Wow this place definitely caught me by surprise... by how good it was.  We drove wayyyy west to try this chicken strip place on a Sunday afternoon for some late lunch.  The restaurant is in a strip mall near Home Depot and it can be easily missed.  Just drive along all the stores until you hit a square chicken head on a blue awning.  The menu is pretty simple:  1.  First you choose your combo, 2 pieces, 4 pieces,  or 6 pieces.  If you have 3 or more people the party platter of 20 seems like a good deal.    2.  Then you choose your type of chicken.  BFG baked, fried, or grilled.  The baked chicken was my fave, tender and moist.  The fried had a delicious panko crust.  The grilled seemed like the healthiest of the bunch.    3.  Next you choose your sauces.  This is when it gets fun.  The teriyaki goes well with the grilled.  The wasabi cream is unique sauce that is pretty popular.  My fave sauces have to be the regular BBQ and Ranch.  I love double dipping into those two and making it a mixture.    4.  Get a side.  Grilled veggies, baked macaroni and cheese, or fries.  The veggies were well seasoned and the baked mac and cheese was super cute in a baby pie tin haha.    5.  Last get your drink.    Very reasonably priced for good quality chicken strips.  The customer service here is great too!  The sauces definitely make the meal.  An awesome place to pick up some appetizers for a party.  I would definitely consider a party platter next time I have to bring something over to someone's house.  P.S. You can add any type of chicken strip to your combo for $1 each.",

    "text": "So...here's the deal. My boyfriend and I have been to Strip N Dip several times and always had a great experience. Until last night. Our experience last night was awful and we will not be going back.  We went in for a quick dinner after work. The place wasn't super busy. There was only 1 family waiting for food when we arrived. My boyfriend and I both ordered 4 piece strip meals (grilled) with grilled veggies and 2 drinks. Our order was placed at 6:05pm. By 6:30pm, the other family (who had ordered before us) finally got their meal. At 6:40pm, we were given our food in to go containers even though we had ordered to eat at the restaurant.  35 minutes for chicken strips and veggies! When we got our food it was cold and a weird combination of rubbery and hard. The chicken had been put on the grill when we arrived and stayed in some sort of \"holding\" area for over 30 minutes! To say customer service is lacking at Strip N Dip is an understatement. There was a younger man and woman working the back area. Working is a stretch...they were playing around and not really doing much of anything other than bossing around the girl working the register. The girl behind the register was the only reason I'm even giving 1 star. She was sweet and trying to be helpful (and it was only her first day on the job). When my boyfriend and I finally got our food (we had just about given up and were about to ask for a refund since it had been SO long), we were disgusted by the fact that our food was barely edible. Almost $20 for rubbery, burnt, gross chicken bits (no where near big enough to be considered strips by any stretch). We didn't even look at the rest of our food and asked for a full refund. The young woman who had been working in the back was on the phone by the register and the young man was just kind of hovering around, not doing anything helpful. The poor girl on her first day asked us what was wrong after we had stood at the counter, right in front of the woman on the phone, for at least a minute. We told her and she asked how to do a refund. The woman on the phone finally hung up and asked her what happened. She NEVER acknowledged my boyfriend or me and the young man simply acted like we weren't even there.  We have told so many of our friends in the past how great this place was, and now we're telling EVERYONE we know to stay away. Service is non-existent as is quality and consistency. What a joke! Never again will we return to Strip N Dip, which is a shame. Another good place in Vegas destroyed.  DO NOT GO TO STRIP N DIP UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE SADLY DISAPPOINTED!",

We tried the baked and the grilled chicken combos. My favorite of the two was the Baked chicken because it had moe flavor whereas the grilled chicken lacked flavor. The dipping sauces help mask that. Although, both were extra tender (yum!)  We only wished that we would have ordered more since we were still hungry after we finished",

    "text": "Chicken strips & Thai ice tea ~ why not?  Lots of mixed feelings on this place. I came here for two reasons: Yelpers seem to love this place & they have funnel cakes! It's hard to ignore funnel cakes!   This place is located in a very large strip mall & walking in I have to say I was not impressed. It was run down. The decor itself is nothing special but I let that slide when things are tidy. They weren't. It was also dirty. Trash on the floors, everything seemed out of place & the kitchen area which is open shouldn't be because there was shit everywhere. For a moment I thought to myself, this can't be it.   We ordered the fried strips that come in panko which were great. Fries were ok. Garlic toast was really good & my man loved the hot chick. We also had the baked strips with mac & cheese, both good. Overall the food was good. They gave a wide variety of side sauces & I loved trying most of them. My favorites were the honey mustard & sweet chili. The Thai tea was my least favorite item of the evening as it was bitter & needed more sugar (super disappointing). Now to the funnel cake. AMAZING! It was perfect & couldn't get any better. By far the highlight!   I appreciated the pop art (always a good thing to see) but the place really needs a facelift. It also really needs to be cleaned. I didn't take pics of all the issues but someone needs to rescue this place. The food is good & it would taste even better if the atmosphere was improved. Food gets 4 stars but atmosphere & cleanliness get 2 so I settled on an overall rating of 3.",

You pretend \"they\" are not talking to you, but you realize they are; because no one wants to accept the overall responsibility of making one of the most important decisions of day.  I have the yelp app.  I don't have that problem.  BFG with all it's raves was an easy choice.  Though I will admit that upon arrival and finding out it truly is a hole in the wall in terms of space, I almost panicked.  Tight space and seating was quickly going by the wayside.  As luck would have it we staked our claim for a table for four.  The menu is simple and consists of chicken strips be they baked, fried or grilled.  I chose four of the panko fried.  Succulent meat with a light crunch, delicious!  The wasabi cream sauce was an awesome compliment.   There are three sides to choose from...Man-N-Cheese, fries or grilled veggies.  I did not try the mac but it was highly received by the eater who ordered it.  The fries...basic but the veggies made me regret not ordering them.  What really caught my eye was the chicken nachos for $3.50.  One of my partners ordered them and I could not believe the quantity and quality for such an incredible price.  I stood up and immediately ordered another!  BFG was the talk of the afternoon and I would easily recommended.",

I only got the Gold Peak tea to begin with, so the machine doesn't do anything for me. They also raised the prices of the meals to add insult to injury. I removed one star for removing drinks from the meals and one star for raising the prices while simultaneously giving less.   Probably won't be a regular here any longer. The days of BFG are over. Just doesn't seem worth it to support this place anymore. The kid at the counter is still really great with customer service though. He's always friendly and attentive. Just don't like the direction this company is headed in. There are plenty of other places to get my chicken fix.",

The eclectic menu has something to offer for all. If you feel like binging, get the fried strips with Mac n cheese on the side. If you want to be healthy, go with baked with a side of veggies.   I personally think the baked and fried are the best strips. The wasabi cream sauce is delicious. They also have Thai tea. Yay.",

No salmonella :-)  The place looks clean.   I noticed the sauce cup size was half the size of a normal cup. Then I figured out why lol. The portions are small. The garlic bread was tiny. The macaroni and cheese was okay decent size. We had the grilled chicken. I asked 3 times it the strips were big or small... Thru said big. They are not big. They are not medium. I dont know what the fried ones are like. The sauces are flavorful.   Seriously, This place would be great for someone dieting or counting calories. When I had my baby I should have ate here.   All in all, After reading the reviews saying that the food is amazing lol. It's good fast food but, amazing really? I'll go again when I feel like having fried food and try those. They said the grilled and baked shrink when they cook them.  **** if u grew up here... Or if anyone knows what happened to Chicken Quick I use to eat there 20! Years ago. They had Indian bread, and stone ovens it was the best ever. It was on spring mountain road. Message me if you know Please.",

We pulled up to BFG which and it's colorful awning outside.  I did a double take and asked is this really the place.    As we walked in the owner Jin welcomed my friend by her first name and talked about a recent surgery she had.  I asked my friend when was the last time she came in and she stated about 3 weeks ago!  Wow, what a first impression.  You can order the chicken baked, fried, or grilled in 2 strip or 4 strip combo.  I went for the 4 stirp grilled combo, side of veggies (you can get fries), two sauces and soda for 6 bucks.  Chicken was tender and moist, veggies were grilled perfectly and the sauces tied everything together.  Perfect healthy lunch!  Of course I visted BFG the next day!  It's that good!",

    "text": "The day before that horrible HCG diet,  I took the advice of our Las Vegas Yelpers on finding the best chicken fingers in Las Vegas....Most of you folks didn't miss on this one;  Yep, this place is finger licking good!   The owner, Jin has a memory like a elephant, and remembers almost everyone of his customer.   I have say his customer service skills rivals the folks down the street at  Komex,....perhaps even better than them.  I love their concept of baking, Frying, or Grilling chicken. because this one place you can have it your way...sorry Burger King, I had to do it.     Well, I choose the fried chicken strip combo with french fries, Garlic bread, and a diet Pepsi; and added the Mac and Cheese to this order.  My order didn't take too long, and this Chicken Katsu inspired combo was pretty good.    My chicken found themselves being soaked in Ranch and Teriyaki sauce, and sauce were good, but I kind of wished there was some Katsu sauce in house.   The Mac and Cheese had a nice touch of being baked, and had enough cheese to fatten whale....damn, it was great., and the Garlic bread was a nice touch..  My feeling what separate this restaurant from the other Chicken joints in Vegas is Jin, the owner;  he's the person who make you want to come back and patronize this business.   More than a few Las Vegas business owners should take notes and visit BFG; they might learn a great lesson from this business.      Good job, and will be back soon.",

They have a fancy digital coke machine, and big trendy posters on the wall.  It feels like a restaurant down on the Strip.  If you have trouble finding it, it is next door to Home Depot, to the south.    I ordered the baked chicken strips, with the mac n cheese, and chose the wasabi and strip dip as my two dips, all under $8.  The chicken was juicy and tender, very good!  The mac n cheese was awesome, perfectly caramelized on top and not overly rich in the cheese department.  The sauces were bang on as well, especially the wasabi.  It was lightly sweet, but still gave that classic wasabi nostril burn!   I am definitely coming back, especially considering it is pretty close to my house.  I want to try the fried chicken strips, but at the same time this is a good healthier alternative to my Raising Canes addiction.  I also met one of the new owners, a young man named Matt.  He was very friendly and obviously cares a lot about the quality of his establishment and getting the word out.  If you haven't tried Strip N Dip, give them a shot!",

First time in, a young, skinny lad with darker hair assisted me in Aug., and the young woman working on Friday (1/8/16) night around 5pm was also very kind.

Back to the chicken, I actually preferred the baked over the fried, the sauces save the fried chicken otherwise they're pretty bland.

I'm going to make this short and sweet (like me ;b) :  Chicken: Baked, Grilled, FRIED (being the best, PANKO, similar to Hawiian style breaded chicken, friggin DELICIOUS)  Flavors: WASABI, BBQ, Buffalo, Honey Mustard, Sweet Chilie, Teriyaki, Ranch, and HOUSE STYLE SAUCE (YUM)  Signature: Hot Chick (like a hot dog and chicken sandwich put together, try it! on $2)   Price is not bad at all for what you get and of course they have other items like salad and oddly enough their own unique style of MAC n CHEESE, which was also very good :D",

Owner Jin Choe asked us for our names and he remembered that we had actually met a week earlier when he was picking up food from Soyo where me and a group of the yelp-izzles were getting our drink on. I noticed that he was on a first name basis with all his customers. That's what's up!  What I ordered:  #1 -4 Baked Strips -Baked Mac & Cheese -Garlic Bread -2 Sauces (I picked Wasabi Cream and Buffalo) -Reg. Drink (Arnold Palmer)  Everything was yummy yummy in my tummy. The Wasabi Cream sauce was the bomb-diggity!!   The service was excellent. Jin came around numerous times to make sure everything was alright and that our sodas were topped off. I will mos def come back to try other items from the menu and the whatever the weekly special is.  Thanks for dinner LiLy!",

I've been itching to come here for the longest time, but since it isn't close to my house, my visit has been delayed, but since my gf and I were on vacation for winter break, we placed BFG on our Go-To list and we should've placed it on our Go-To list a few more times!  After reading the rest of my fellow Yelpers' reviews, I already decided on what to order before I even went there.  And when my gf and I showed up here and ordered without even having to look at the menu twice, Jin, the co-owner, knew we were Yelpers!  How cool!  I ordered the #2: Baked Chicken, Baked Mac and Cheese, and garlic toast with Sweet Chili and Cheese.  My gf ordered the #3: Fried Chicken, Baked Mac and Cheese, and garlic toast with Wasabi Cream and BFG sauce.  It was semi busy so Jin gave us a heads up that the food might take a minute and I thought that was cool that he was honest about it.  I saw the other owner, Tin, working up a sweat cooking in the back, but he was never too busy to give a welcoming smile and hello to everyone who came in.  I sat there and looked around and noticed how very welcoming and friendly Jin was with everyone who came in.  He called everyone by name and the best thing about it was that he remembered everyone!  He made sure everyone's drinks were full and had small talk with everyone like they were best friends!  When we got our food, we dug right in! Wasabi cream and Sweet Chili is THE BEST SAUCE EVER!  Definitely memorable and kills my other favorite Cane Sauce.  The chicken was perfectly cooked because even if it was baked, it wasn't dry, but full of juice and flavor!  The mac and cheese was a great addition to the baked chicken and complemented my palette! After we devoured our food, we had some small talk with Jin and got to know him a little bit more.  He even asked to take our photo when we finished our food!  The best part about our visit to BFG wasn't just the delicious chicken and friends, but the hospitality and winning attitude shared by Jin and Tin!  I wish you the best of luck and look forward to the future surprises that BFG has to offer!  The food was soo good, I had to order some to-go to bring home for my mom to try! BFG, son! And wha!?",

I can't believe it, even my co-worker who never had Bibimbap or Korean food to say the least tried and LOVED it, although he couldn't remeber the name of the dish (weak sauce) he showed me a pic and I was like dat looks Korean to me!

    "text": "I can't believe how many times I passed this little place in the last few years. I worked 5 minutes away from this place and never stopped. I remember thinking chicken strips? What? Boo!  Instead of stopping at BFG, I ate at several other mediocre spots in the area. Shame on me for being a HATER!  A few weeks ago, one of my coworkers had lunch at her desk and it smelled terrific. I peeked in, and asked what she was eating. She told me she was eating grilled chicken and veggies from BFG. She then proceeded to tell me that you can order your chicken baked, fried, or grilled. I then made it a point to review it on yelp and noticed all the wonderful reviews this place received.   This past weekend, my family and I wanted to try something different. I suggested BFG, and off we went. At this point, I still didn't put it together that the place I was searching for was the same place I dissed time and time again.  When we pulled up, I was like oh -this place? We ran in because it was freezing cold outside, and ordered the family special.   We ordered 10 fried strips, 5 baked, and 5 grilled. I can't even make an argument on which version was better. I loved them all equally--just like my kids!  The baked chicken was seasoned perfectly, and no dipping sauces were needed.   I added a dash of hot sauce to the grilled chicken and I was in heaven. The best thing about eating the fried strips was the Chile sauce that was available for dipping. Oh man-that was good!   The sides were good too! The baked mac n cheese was done perfectly, and the fries were crispy and delicious. The garlic bread was mediocre, but who cares!  I have never seen my kids eat so fast....   Co-owner Matt was super friendly and even gave us a sample of their chicken nachos to try! He mentioned that they were starting to cater on the side. Immediately, my wife booked him for our daughter's birthday in February. Oh, and my Son's birthday in April! Sorry Matt--you asked for it!   I love this place! Chicken strips at their best!",

They had many sauces to choose from, but I'm not a sauce person so I just chose whatever.  Note: This place isn't big at all and the seating is limited to about 20 people total.   I will be back...

The garlic bread was delicious, garlicy goodness.  The chicken strips were smallish but good. They come with two sauces and I selected sweet chili and wasabi cream. The sweet chili had a nice balance of sweet and spicy. I really enjoyed the wasabi cream which had a little kick and was quite delicious.  I will definitely be back.

We both got Mac n cheese as highly recommended by every other review and the staff. It was great!!! My picky eater even agreed! I was a little bummed they don't make their own ranch since they make almost every other sauce, I hate bottled ranch so I didn't even try. The cheese sauce is great for fries and I enjoyed the buffalo for my baked fingers. We will be back!",

    "text": "Someone wrote on <a href=\"http://Yelp.com\">Yelp.com</a>, \"one person can not rely on the reviews of yelp; the individual must try for themselves and make their own conclusion.\"  I read the reviews for BFG Chicken Strips and was even inspired with all the reviews made by all the members of Yelp.  I made the suggestion to my boss to eat here for lunch and she happily agreed.  Considering we always order to go, I placed a call for pick up.  Towards of the end of the conversation, the cashier over the phone advised me it would be ready in six minutes.  Whoa!  Wait a minute, I'm about a good 15 minutes away!  He was kind enough to tell the cooks to start cooking six minutes before I arrive.    Off I went immediately after I hung up the phone.  Almost there I thought, however I got lost.  Who gets lost in Charleston and Rainbow?  Because I couldn't find the place, I made a few u-turns and finally decided to go towards Home Depot.  Yup, there it was hiding next to Home Depot.  That hardware retail store has a way of keeping any small establishments from being seen on Rainbow Road.  Luckily, it wasn't swamped with a ton of people like I thought it would be.  I walked straight in and there were a few people seated and another few lined up to order.  It was awesome how the cashier would talk to each customer as if he's known them for a while.  First names of each customer were said at least three times before they were done ordering.  That's very impressive.  But, that is the difference between a mom and pop's shop and a big corporation fast food chain.  It's more personal.  My boss and I ordered the same lunch, #4, Build Your Own!  We decided to get four fried strips, baked Mac and cheese, garlic bread, two sauces, and regular drink all for $5.75 plus tax.  :D  I was excited to take this back to the office and just devour it as the aroma was teasing me and calling out my name.  As soon as I got back to the office, we sat down and I just delved in as though I hadn't eaten in a month. What can I say?  I love to pig out.  To describe my meal:  A swirl of rainbows just came over me as I bit in to the chicken strip.  The breading was so lightly crisp and the meat was just so tender; the seasoning, was just right.  It didn't even need sauce, but I got the BFG sauce which is like a Thousand Island dressing with more zest to it and Ranch.  Mmmmm... you are just so yummy!  I'm still imagining it right now.  The baked Mac and cheese was heavenly too with gooey cheese of awesomeness!  That garlic bread was one of the best garlic breads I've had with lots of flavor and the right texture when biting in to it.  I'm closing my eyes as I'm typing this and reminiscing Tuesday's lunch.    My boss even said, \"Good call on lunch!\"  Yup, I got brownie points that day.  Thank you BFG!  Now I have to figure out what to eat for lunch today.  I hope it'll be equal or top this lunch.",

We had grilled and fried strips, both were equally good, just depends on what you are in the mood for. The chicken is very fresh tasting and moist. It's all white meat from what I could tell. The wasabi cream sauce is fantastic, if you like some zing and that unique wasabi taste, you're gonna love that concoction. The sweet chili sauce is pretty good, for me it would be perfect if it was a bit heavier on the chili half and less on the sweet side. But I'm a fan of heat so take that for what it's worth. The mac and cheese is a meal in itself and very delicious, rich, gooey, good, rich, gooey, melty and, well, you get the point. LOL The chicken nachos are delicious and presented very nicely. You can tell the guys working in the kitchen are taking that extra few seconds and dressing the dishes out so they look tidy and clean, I like that.   One of the owners was there and man, the guy is on the ball. You can tell he really cares about his spot and it shows in the way the food is presented and the extra time he spends with the customers.   My kids were thrilled with the place too, they want to go back for sure. And we will go back. We actually tried BFG because of reviews we read on here, so thanks for everyone who ate here prior and took the time to share their good experiences.",

I like the occasional boneless piece of chicken and BFG is the best spot in Las Vegas to get Chicken strips and the only place I would go for them. Tastes better than \"The Chicken Lady\" in LA.",

    "text": "*Best Chicken Strips in Las Vegas*  Really enjoyed this place, easily some of the best chicken strips I've ever had. They have a simple menu but it is by no means limiting with the various options you can mix and match your meal with. BFG lets you know everything you need to know about the chicken choices Baked, Fried, or Grilled. Once you chose the chicken you have the tough decision of which of the 9 dipping flavors to choose from; Wasabi Cream, BBQ, Ranch, Buffalo, Honey Mustard, Sweet Chili, Teriyaki, Cheese, and BFG (their house dipping sauce). And finally accompanying each meal is a piece of toast and your final decision between a side of Mac n cheese, grilled vegetables, or fries.  Now let me start off by saying that all the different types of chicken are delicious. I was a bit skeptical about the baked chicken but let me tell you, they know how to do it right. Whenever I picture baked chicken, it seems bland but at BFG they spice it just right to give it a kick in flavor. The grilled chicken has a bit of sauce giving it a unique flavor setting it aside from the baked. And finally the fried chicken is amazing! These aren't your run of the mill chicken strips you get at a bar. You'll notice the difference immediately due to their use Panko instead of regular batter which I love because it gives the chicken a nice crispy texture with just the right amount of breading.   Now the sauces are really up to personal preference. and the majority are pretty run of the mill so I'll just get into their \"unique\" sauces. The BFG house sauce has a very light undertone flavor resembling thousand island and other flavors that will need more tastings to get down. The sweet chili sauce is an asian style sauce with the spices in it working very well with the sweet flavor of it. I was very surprised by how well the sweet chili worked with the chicken. When I first saw and smelled the Sweet chili sauce it seemed like it did not belong next to chicken strips, but when you take your first bite of a chicken strip covered in this sauce it will all make sense. It's a delicious flavor explosion in your mouth with the sweet chili enhancing the flavor of the chicken. Easily on of my favorites. Now the wasabi cream is pretty straight forward, it tastes like wasabi. But it is not nearly as overwhelming as actual wasabi and it has none of the burn. It is another surprising flavor that I have not seen anywhere else and that taste delicious.  I haven't gotten a chance to try the grilled vegetables but to me the mac n cheese and fries were not really anything special. And the toast tastes like toast. Also every week they have a new special which I have yet to try any of so when I get a chance I'll update my review.  Overall good service, good food, and decently priced. There really isn't much else to say other than if you haven't tried BFG yet, try it!",

I liked the wasabi sauce myself, that was the best thing about the whole experience actually.  The owner of the place was there handling the cashier.  Pretty cool guy, and  I really like supporting local businesses.",

    "text": "This restaurant was one of the best macaroni I ever had and the fried chicken was good. I first thought this was going to be Like any restaurant that makes okay meals but it made excellent meals. If you ever tried Kane's and like Kane's, you are going to love this. They had a pretty normal menu so I stuck with what I know is good and that is fried chicken with bread. But if you are to buy anything you have to buy the macaroni since that turns the restaurant from a 3 star to a 5 star. Its not a fancy restaurant  and it has foam cups but it is a fast food restaurant .its right next to a comic store. Just to tell you when I was walking I looked inside the comic store next door and grown men where playing dungeons and dragons with there costumes on and I  can't believe that they were grown men. But anyways you should  try this restaurant if you want to try something new.",

All of the staff are incredibly friendly.  The food is great too.  Try all three varieties of their strips... they are all good in different ways.  Some of their sauces are better than others, so just try them out to see which one works for you.  And get the mac and cheese!  It is sooooo good!!",

As a friend recommended we went with the fried chicken strips and stole one of our kids' baked mac & cheese.  The food was very good!  Fries...well I'm sure they were great right out of the fryer, I made the mistake of going to the comic book store next door to it and spending a little too much time there.  I never like cold fries but I can't honestly say how they were fresh, Sweet Chili sauce and ranch were my choices, the sweet chili sauce was very good, ranch was great as well.  Kids enjoyed their food and the wife was pleased as well.  Jin was great, he is running a great operation there.",

The breading is from panko and gives the fried strips a light feel without sacrificing the crispiness. If you're looking to try their baked or grilled stripes, I'd still recommend trying the fried one. They also offer take-out and is very convenient for the lunch work peeps.",
