You order the type of noodles you want and then you can pick out the different types of tempura you want (whole egg, squid, shrimp, assorted veggies, etc).  The food is very affordable (but if you cannot resist adding a ton of tempura to your meal, like me, the prices do add up ).  I had the Kitsune Udon (dashi broth with tofu) both times. My favorite tempura is the whole egg (with runny center) and asparagus.  I also tried the salmon rice balls which were good but I felt like they could have been more generous with the filling.  All in all, a delicious lunch or dinner!  PS Don't forget to check in on Yelp for 10% off or a free drink!",

Pros: - Spacious with plenty of seating - LOVE the interior - A variety of udons to choose from and some other things as well - Friendly and nice workers - I love their drink selection because it's not a typical soda fountain - I see a lot of ramen places, but I rarely see a place that does specifically udon and I love udon - I like how you order up front and get your food after. It makes it seem like a more chill place to hang out vs getting seated first, order, etc etc. I tend to like places where you can order first and is self serve  Cons: - I got the spicy udon, but I felt like it was too salty for me. If they decreased on the saltiness than it would be perfect  Overall, I was craving udon one day and glad I found this place! We went one night for dinner and came back the next day for another round :D We came back the 2nd time during Halloween and one of the workers went around passing everyone candy! That is so sweet to me. I may be back in LV next year, so I'll be looking forward to coming back",

I told the staff that the tea was out and i waited, tired of waiting and finished my main course and finally the tea was made.

My cousin orders the same thing so I told him again on mines, no green onions on mine because im allergic . He looks at me and says ok. Order comes and they messed up so they go ahead and make a new one but forget to actually make it. Whole family is almost done eating and thats when they realize they havent made it yet. Told them to cancel and walked out. Younger dude couldnt get a simple request and couldnt fess that he messed up.  Thanks bro.",

At first glance, it's a pretty restaurant with nice decorations and convincing looking pictures. The workers get a pass because it was slow and they were probably bored. Just having everyone say welcome and look at you at the same time is off-putting. The Kitsune Udon was alright and it was honestly the only reason this even got a 2nd star. If you take a look below at the pictures; the sauce cup for one of the Udon bowls have a completely solidified/fossilized noodle? Onion? Squid? Either way, it was so hard the wooden chopstick I used to pry at it broke. I hope it's just part of the cup as design. The chicken was pretty warm but doesn't seem fresh at all. I was assuming it would be a bit hotter because it's under a light but maybe the light doesn't do anything. Also it was a bit pink... But probably the biggest thing is the water. I don't know what happened here but the water smelled so bad. It smelled like fish has been sitting in it for days. The worst part is when I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and mouth, the water smelled the same. Overall, fixes should be made and this place will definitely be better.",

Basically it's a self serve Japanese restaurant where you order your food and drink at the counter, get ur number and wait to be called.   Lots of choices and the price is reasonable.   Highly suggest buying a cup to try out their Calpico or ice tea in a hot day. We checked from yelp and receive one for free of charge.  Also when you are ordering ramen make sure to add 2.50 for a mini rice bowl if you are first time coming to this place.   Onigiri is ok.  Must have: ramen since they are fresh made every day. Suggested: pork belly rice bowl, shrimp tempura, steam pork belly bun/Bao, Calpico.   My only disappointment is that couldn't get a try of their taiyaki since the machine was broken.",

Also, another plus, they do military discount. The decor was also very cute. I cant wait to come back to try more of their delish meals",

Definitely a keeper ^__^  shrimp and pumpkin tempura were delicious and crisp as well.  Thank you all~",

They left you add a mini bowl for $2.50 of your choice and please treat yourself by ordering the garlic miso pork belly. That shiz delish. As for drinks, they have a Freestyle Coke machine, but what you really want is their LEMONADE. I used to work at Hot Dog on a Stick and this lemonade is my #2 right after Hot Dog on a Stick's lime lemonade. Will definitely be back!",

They're only open for several hours a day, around dinner time. Don't let this deter you from coming though. You won't have a problem getting through the line (cafeteria style) and finding a seat. I would give this place 5 stars but I had a indifferent experience my first time. The reason being was that although I had a buzzer, I acquired all three of my dishes at different times and in different fashion. When it first buzzed, I went up and got my first dish. 10 minutes passed and then finally the second dish was brought out to us.Another 5 min passed and I finally had to go up again. I had wished they stuck to one format and are more consistent. Otherwise some dishes are a hit or miss. The pork belly bao and nabeyaki are my favorite though. It doesn't hurt to give this place a shot. Let me know what you think",

The texture of udon noodle was not what I was expecting from high reviewed reataurant. Tempuras were not fresh. No flavor at all from the ingredients. Kabocha tempura cannot go wrong usually but this was way too thin and the flavor wasn't right... Age in kitsune udon had no flavor either. Simply not good enough for the high reviews they receive on Yelp.. .I'm very confused. The price should be cheaper for this quality too. Staff here is friendly though. Therefore, 2 stars.

The staff were all nice, so that's a plus. I ordered the kike udon and curry katsu. In all honesty, I think they got their playing wrong. The curry katsu came in a bowl that's bigger than my sink, it was like obnoxiously huge lol. The udon, I know they make the noodles on site, but honestly, it's not as good as the prepackaged ones. The noodles don't have the texture and the feel of udon noodles that I like. The food overall wasn't really that good to me. So overall, this restaurant is a solid 3 star. I'll probably visit once in a while, but it's definitely not in my top10",

While everyone was spectacular, i was blown away by Jasmine. She greeted us at the door (must've caught the clueless look on our faces!), walked us through the process, checked on us several times to make sure we were doing okay, and helped carry our food to our table since we were wrangling a toddler and all the accompanying STUFF that comes along with a kid.

So we were beyond excited when we learned Cafe Sanuki opened here in Vegas. And happy to say we were not disappointed.   Items tried & liked (so far):  Curry Udon Kake Udon Kisune Udon Zaru Udon Shrimp Tempura Asparagus Tempura Sweet Potato Tempura Kabocha Tempura Zucchini Tempura Squid Tempura Fish Cake Tempura Kakiage Inari Taiyaki Cafe Sanuki Lemonade  Calpico Yogurt Drink (try it with a squirt or two of mango syrup)   Noodles are cooked perfectly and broths are tasty & hot.   In my opinion, the onigiri could use a little more seasoning.  I tried the spam (1st visit) & tuna mayo (7th visit) and both were a little bland.  It's great if you dip it into the tempura sauce.   Restaurant is spacious & clean. Staff are always friendly & helpful :)",

    "text": "On a cold day, what's better than a nice hot bowl of udon?! I came here for lunch on a weekday. As you enter the restaurant, they have a display case of all the menu items, so you can see what you want to order. Walk around the corner and they have a menu you can look at as well. There are trays stack up and you grab a tray and place your order. It's a bit confusing at first because I didn't know if i was supposed to wait for my noodles..no one told me anything. But within a min, they gave me my bowl of udon noodles after placing the order. There are also tempuras and chicken, where you can grab what you want. The prices for tempura range about $1.75 per piece. After you grab whatever tempura you want, you pay and then eat! The style is set up somewhat like a fast food style.  My order: Kake udon. The most simple of them all. Broth was good, hot, and refreshing. The udon noodles were cooked to perfection. Chewy texture, not overcooked or undercooked.  Shrimp tempura: i only grabbed one piece. The size of the shrimp tempura was pretty small for  the price. It was also cold as well. It was not good.   Chicken. This was the first thing i took a bite of as soon as i sat down with my food. And unfortunately this was cold as well. They give you 2 pieces of chicken on a skewer, which would have been decent if it was hot.   Drinks: they have calpico and sanuki lemonade!  Sanuki lemonade taste like a mix of calpico and lemonade together. It was pretty bomb! They also have syrups you can flavor your drinks as well. But I highly recommend the sanuki lemonade!   Overall it was a good udon place minus the tempura.They need to do something about the food warming for the tempuras,  because obviously what they have is not keeping the food up to the correct temperatures per standards. But udon is definitely worth the try!",

You come, you pick your udon ( soup, dipping, even fried), pick your tempura, pick your sides if you want any! And viola!   Me party of one dined here with enough food for 4!! Naturally! I wanted their yaki udon. Aka yakisoba style udon! It took about 20 extra minutes to get that dish. But Holy massive bowl Batman! It's HUGE! Like 3-4 bowls combined in one huge!!! It was huge!!! Good but huge!   The clam udon: very excited. A ok. The broth is too light but not in a flavorful way. I enjoy the clams!   The mini curry bowl: this was delish!! Totally enjoyed it!! And nothing mini about it either. It's a steal for under $4!!   Tempura are pretty good too. They were out of most things. I tried squid and the egg. All of this came out to under $30!! So much food! So much food and fresh hand made noodles! Total steal!! Totally worth a trek! Totally will be back! Oh and free yogurt drink with yelp check in!",

I blame myself for not going with their popular items, but that is why I will come back to try their more popular dishes. I got the Yaki Udon with extra noodles... not the best decision ever. Noodles were perfect, but the whole dish itself was very forgettable... so were my additions... I don't think I will ever order a thinly sliced kabocha tempura ever again for $1.25... Shrimp Tempura addition was better.    I also don't like pictures of food that is not the proper representation of the food itself. The Tuna Mayo rice roll looks nothing like their page. The picture used on their page is hand made, not machine made (i.e. used a mold) where all the edges were perfectly straight ... The filling was also lacking flavor and moisture from the mayo.  Now that I know what to avoid on my next visit,  I will definitely try their carbonara udon and other udon dishes with sauces.",

    "text": "They definitely had growing pains to deal with after a massive turnout for their opening week, but I enjoyed myself the second time on a significantly less-crowded visit.  Cafe Sanuki is the latest udon restaurant to hit Las Vegas and they're on the \"strip mall\" side of the plaza on the southeast corner of Spring Mountain and Decatur. They have a cafeteria line and manage to get both noodles and rice bowls ready quickly, and they have tempura and onigiri ready for consumption between the entree station and the register.  During my first visit, I had the Mentai cream udon ($8.80), a low/no-broth hot udon based on pollock roe. The udon was certainly creamy, but the noodles themselves were softer than I'd expected. The portion seemed a little on the small side, but perhaps that's a trick of using a bowl that's so enormous as to feel a bit unwieldy.  The second time around, I picked the Ontama Bukake udon ($6.45), which is served with broth on the side. The noodles seemed to stay just a bit more al dente without constant contact with the delicious broth (presented on the side). The egg was pretty nice, with liquid whites around that \"gelatinous\" semi-cooked yolk. The bowl was a bit less unwieldy, although it still has an odd lopsided shape.  I also had a Miso Garlic Pork Belly bowl ($3.95 mini size). It was a good side dish, but I kinda wish that the pork belly wasn't sliced so thinly. It wasn't as complex as chashu pork at various ramen places.  I also had tempura both times. I'm not 100% sure if they use the typical panko breading, but they did get a crispy texture, so I'm ok with that. The shrimp ($1.75) was pretty good, but the other one had soft rubbery texture reminiscent of improperly cooked calamari. Upon second visit, I realized that it was incorrectly labeled as chicken the first time. It probably really is calamari. I didn't try it again, instead opting for the pumpkin ($1.25), which is soft inside and reasonably crispy on the outside.  I also took advantage of the Yelp check-in offer both times for a drink (normally $2.25). I did try some of their teas and their Calpico (new on the 2nd visit), but I kept going back to their house lemonade, which is a surprisingly creamy and light take on the beverage. Fountain drinks, fruit syrups, and hot hojicha tea are also available.  I'd consider returning to Cafe Sanuki for a quick bite in the future. They're fast, and the food seems almost as delicious as more typical udon restaurants.",

To your right, you order and pay. Sometimes your food will come out while you're waiting in line & if not, they give you a little pager so you can sit down & wait. The pager system is a bit confusing... it seemed like our orders kept getting mixed up with other customers (so just keep an eye out on what you actually ordered). While you wait in line, you can grab a variety of tempura & onigiri. Yum!   I ordered the Untama udon & my egg was beautifully poached! If you are someone that doesn't want something too savory/salty, this is a good pick. Next, the mental! While there may not be much mental, it packs a lot of flavor! A little goes a long way.   Did I mention they have a huge selection with their soda fountain?! It's a bit overwhelming. They have a ton of flavors to choose from. Just try to drink a little before you sit back down. Two drinks I tried seemed a bit watered down.   Hey, Rachel! The drinks where Diet Coke & root beer :) thanks for following up!",

The restaurant is set up like a cafeteria, you pick up a tray at the start of the line and order, and wait for your food to be prepared. You will walk across a small section of add-on items such as tempura, soft boiled eggs, spam musubi, chicken skewers. Then you pay and get seated and when the buzzer buzzed, you pick your food up from the counter. The young girl that rang me up was nice and mentioned they opened on Nov last year.  I loved the Niku Udon (Tender sliced beef on top of warm udon noodle). This was very reasonably priced at $7.45. I added an egg for an extra $1. I didn't care for the tempuras that I got as an add-ons. It wasn't as fresh.  The udons were absolutely delectable and the bowls was not huge but a good size. The broths were so flavorful and delicious.",

I love the display of the plastic food as soon as you walk in. They look so realistic! It also reminded me of the time I was at the Japanese airport with my mom and little bro oohing and ahhing at the plastic food display because we never saw something so beautiful lol.   Anyways, I got the yaki udon and grabbed 2 shrimp tempura and 1 tempura fried egg. Once I paid for my food, the lady gave me a beeper to alert me when my yaki udon was done.   Sooo...this is the part that kind of irked me. I sat at the table waiting for my noodles and waited...and waited...and waited. I probably waited a good 20-25 minutes before a nice young lady came up to me and asked me if I got my food. I told her no and that I was still waiting. She then said she'll check with the kitchen and after a few minutes, she came back and informed me they were making it now and apologized for the wait. I'm not exactly sure what happened...maybe my ticket didn't go through? It was a good thing I wasn't in a hurry.   Onto the food, the tempura is bomb. So nicely fried and crispy without being heavy. The yaki udon was flavorful and the consistency of the noodles itself was nice. If I were to suggest one thing is to add more meat into the dish.   So even with the unexpected wait time, I do plan on coming back and trying out the other dishes that they offer and the lemonade! I've read the lemonade is quite tasty. Hopefully next time I won't have to wait as long.",

You first order the type of dish you want, they give you a receipt, then you can choose side dishes such as Tempura (ex. Vegetable Tempura), Onigiri (Rice Ball), etc. The Cashier will total all the items together to give you your total amount.   I ordered the Mentai Cream Udon. Mentai Cream uses Salted Alaskan Fish roe cooked in a creamy sauce mixed with the Udon Noodles. I also bought a Salmon onigiri. The packaging are normal for the onigiri in Japan. There are specific order to open the package, so make sure to read the directions located on the bottom of the onigiri. The Salmon Onigiri was salty, but the creamy sauce of the Mentai Cream goes well with the salty Salmon Onigiri.   Cafe Sanuki has a nice atmosphere that goes with the interior design. I had a good experience at Cafe Sanuki and hope to go back soon. I noticed that they play Japanese music, some I was able to recognize~",

You make a right to the kitchen counter area where you place your order. The food is prepared right away and some of the noodle bowls are ready in no time. Your eye catches the several rows of freshly prepared tempura everything, hand rolls, takoyaki etc. You help yourself to a little bit of everything wondering if you ordered enough.  After paying you find a table in the large, well-lit dining area. You make a stop by the fountain drink area. Now here's a bonus, they have a Calpico dispenser, so if you love this yogurt flavored Japanese drink then you're in heaven. Next to it is the surprisingly delicious creamy lemonade. All of this with free refills. Now the food. We always loved carbonara udon and this is no exception, with large cubes of bacon in the sauce. Loved the niku udon with thinly sliced beef. We had to try the miso pork belly which was so flavorful. We also had shrimp and squid tempura, crunchy tempura spinach(?) and karaage on a skewer. All good! We were enjoying our meal so much we kept asking ourselves how come we haven't been here before?!!! I checked and they've been only open for about a year so we haven't missed out too much. Lots of time to make up for lost time. (= This place reminded us very much of Marukame Udon which is our favorite in Honolulu. Now we don't have to fly to Hawaii to get equally great food. Did I mention the service was also excellent?  --- Now on out 3rd visit. Still trying new things and loving it all. Did I mention that his place has really good value for your money? Most of the bowls/entrees on the menu is a $7-8. This our family's favorite restaurant.",

The curry rice is good (can be a bit spicy for some), the donburi, udon, spicy pork bowl (can be spicy too), tempura items, and onigiri (tuna mayo and ume) are all good here.  Some of the bowls can also be ordered in a half size portion for smaller eaters, check the menu or ask when you order.  The soda machine is a pick your favorite coke product and you can have cherry, vanilla, lime, etc flavors added at the machine. Plus soft drinks are bottomless. You will need to bus your own tray back to the cleaning area between the dining room and the cafeteria order/pick up location before you leave.  Also fun is the typical plastic food samples of menu items when you walk in the door, just like Japan, designed for those who cannot decide without seeing what it looks like first.",

    "text": "My sister, her boyfriend and best friend Chun posted this place on their social media which made me want to try it and I have no regrets!! The restaurant is something similar to cafeteria style. Which PERSONALLY, I think makes eating your food fun!   I had the Kake Udon, mini Katsu curry bowl, 2 shrimp tempuras & a drink! (I know I'm a fat ass) The total was roughly $12 & I got full pretty fast. The restaurant seating area was super space but I do have to say, the only down side is the area where you pick up your food. It can be a little crowed and I know some people can't tolerate it. But besides that, it's a great environment.   The staff is super helpful and nice! And did I mention that they serve Calpis as a drink option!? ALSO, you can add different varieties of syrups to it to taste better? My favorite, Calpis & Mango syrup. TRUST ME, YOU WONT REGRET!   Overall, I'm super stoked to have a place here in vegas that offers good authentic Japanese cuisine for AFFORDABLE prices. This place is a must visit! It deserves these 5 stars for sure!",

For more detail: I walked in around lunch time and was immediately greeted in Japanese fashion. The cashier was helpful in that she was able to describe what kind of restaurant (cafeteria-style!) this was and how exactly to order and pay. My friend and I ordered, paid, and received our food in under 5 min; I ordered the beef udon bowl and a mini rice bowl, which came out by the time we paid (super fast!) while my friend's took a bit longer for the carbonara.  Seating was great, this place has a lot of room. The drink selection was great, ranging from soda fountain to calpico. Throughout our lunch, the staff was always there to make sure we were satisfied. Overall, a great experience and they definitely found a repeat customer.  Thanks, y'all!",

This was our first time at this Japanese cafe and it was quite similar like the one in hawaii, Murakame Udon but this place had rice bowls and more drinks were offered. I really love this place and price were reasonable. My husband and I had the miso garlic pork belly and we shared different types of tempura and a pork belly bao on a steamed bun. Everything was delicious. I deducted a star due to the fact that not one or a few tempura asparagus was ready for grab in the start of opening and the fountain tea drinks were down and i love my ice teas. Anyhow, we will be back with the rest of the family. A good lunch quickie. Happy eats!!!",

    "text": "This is how Udon (and most Asian Noodles) should be served. Cafe Sanuki more closely mirrors the style of restaurant in Japan where you aren't sitting down for an hour to grab a meal that takes moments to prepare and execute and requires almost no service beyond getting your food.  Walking in, you are greeted by the open style kitchen, a display of their dishes, as well as someone making and cooking udon noodles. You walk up with a tray and order, receive your udon unless it is one that takes longer to prepare, grab tempura with plastic tongs, and choose side dishes if you like. Then you pay for your food.   Then you grab any of the open tables and enjoy your food. When done, you simply leave your tray in a bussing area (not sure if we are supposed to clear our tray but employees seem to be cleaning up the area).  Quick, convenient, great value. And the udon is quite tasty too. I have had a chance to sample the niku, onsen tamago and the mentaiko cream udon. The beef was very tasty and tender. The tamago is imported from Japan and is organic and vegetarian, and the mentaiko cream had great flavor.  I had a chance to try the miso pork belly rice bowl as well - the pork belly was okay, but I'd definitely focus on the udon here.   A special note about their lemonade - it's a little creamy and light in flavor which is actually pleasant because it is not overwhelmingly sweet.  One thing to watch out for might be noodle texture. The first time we went our noodles were a little overcooked and too soft. They were intensely busy with a line out the door and it was soft opening so I won't hold it against them, as the second time was better.",

Few things I liked about the place: The restaurant is spacious, and clean. The staff was helpful. Good size of selections.  Things that I didn't like: The udon was over cooked; they were a bite soggy. Tempura were greasy/oily. There was a trash can in the middle of the hallway on the way to the restroom.  I also had their famous lemonade, it was a decent but different cup of lemonade, it almost felt like creamy lemonade.  Overall experience was okay. I didn't have the desire to comeback soon but I probably will because my kids did like this place.",

    "text": "You'll literally feel like you've stepped into a restaurant in Japan. Once you walk in there is a display case filled with bowls so you have a visual of what they look like. There are also menus for you and there's usually someone that greets you when you first come in and asks if it's your first time. If it is, they'll explain the process to you but it's simple enough. Grab a tray and let the person working know what number you'd like then grab as much tempura as you want. Plenty of seating and workers are super helpful.   They offer extra noodle options for $2 more I believe. They make the noodles fresh and sometimes you can see them making it in front of you! The tempura is made fresh. I highly recommend the soft boiled egg and shrimp tempura. The sweet potato tempura was just eh. I think it could have been cooked a bit longer.   My go to is the niku udon since it has beef and the broth is light, not too salty. I've also added the miso garlic pork belly bowl to my niku udon and thought the pork belly was too salty. I was expecting sort of like a braised fatty piece but the pieces were very thin and on the chewy side. My friends enjoyed the curry udon and seafood tomato cream.  Their drink station offers teas, calpico I believe and coke products. Don't forget to check in on yelp for a free drink!",

But Sanuki goes a little further with the inclusion of tempura and oden on the menu to make you full on Japan.  You take a tray, put your order in, and make your way to pay, passing by all the fried goodness on your way to your seat.  Prices are very fair with the typical udon at $6.45.  Many options both vegetarian and with fish.  Quality, home-cooked noodles with a nice soft broth, though a little fishy at times.  I find udon a little empty at times as the dish is 95% broth and noodle, but Sanuki filled me up and was tasty to the last sip.  Very cool new entity in China Town.  Plenty of seating, easy parking, god eats...highly recommended.",

They were running around the kitchen and getting in each other's ways while making the food. There were around 8 guests in front of us and we waited around 30 minutes to order. Cashier was struggling handling a call coming in and ringing up my food at the same time.   Food: 3/5; My curry udon was not hot and had a strong cheese flavor. My boyfriend's Nabeyaki was hot but lacked flavor. Tempura was stale since it has been sitting out for a while. Half the items on the menu (i.e. rice balls, some of the tempura, takoyaki, etc) we're not out.   Overall: Not impressed, if you want to try this place, come at off hours to beat the crowd so you get your food faster and maybe warmer along with more variety of food available. I wanted to try other foods but was irritated by the overall experience so I just ate the food we got.",

My daughter and I had the spicy noodles that I must say are the best we've had in Chinatown. Just delicious also had some chicken on skewers and some fried tempura which I also really enjoyed. Large and spacious dinning area. My husband had the beef teriyaki #25 and liked it. The help was very attentive to our needs.

It all started with a Facebook ad which I must admit are sometimes obnoxious, but for some reason Cafe Sanuki's ad got our attention and we decided to give it a try; I must say it was our best decision ever. Starting with the extremely clean environment (you could smell the cleanliness in the restaurant), the friendly lady who greeted us in the front and explained how their ordering system worked, and the food display exactly like you'd find in Japan, this place is a gem in Las Vegas! It's so hard to find a good noodle house in Las Vegas with authentic Japanese food, and Cafe Sanuki has impressed us all with their udon noodles, broth, the perfect tempura breading, the amazing pork belly bao (a must try), and yes, a calpico fountain machine!!!!! Needless to say, we're coming back very soon. Probably tomorrow.",

Their level of hospitality is rare in the dining industry now days.  The food was awesome!  Cafe SANUKI has a wide range of authentic Japanese cuisine prepared quickly with expertise.  I've had a few of the udon items and some the bowl items as well. They were all delicious. I also tried a few tempura items, rice rolls, and other tasty munchies. The prices are affordable, as well. If you also consider the pleasing interior design and overall atmosphere at this gem of coziness, you experience a level of flavor and comfort that is rare in the world of casual dining.",

Being that the pictures looked much smaller than they are in person to us, we also ordered the Mentai Udon. 1 order is def enough for 1 person! Lol All the fried items are great. I really enjoyed my tonkatsu. Udon of course is the star. Texture was perfect. We were not crazy about the Mentai Udon, but that just comes down to our flavor preferences and not their execution. My husband is already wanting to go back and we went yesterday. Lol. Their lemonade is the best on the frickin planet!!! It is sooooo good. Their lemonade is seriously a must! Next time I'm getting the same dish that my husband ordered, the cold ramen and add some tempura. Until then I will be dreaming of Cafe Sanuki. Only reason they are not getting 5 stars is mostly because their beeper thing sounds like a fire alarm. It takes away a bit from the experience. They should rethink those alarms, maybe recalibrate the sound. A number of folks were remarking on the disturbance and trust me, you guys should quiet them down.",

Pure feelings of nostalgia filled my head from my trip to Japan. I got a kake udon, which is the most well known udon. It was taste wise and looks wise just like the one I had in Japan. As I was ordering it, a man who turned out to be the owner asked if I want a soft boiled egg and I replied of course, which he replied with \"that is the only way to eat udon.\" I later waved him down to compliment him on his success so far. He was one of the most passionate guys I've ever met. This place has so much going for it. I guarantee this will be the best udon in vegas!!",

    "text": "I definitely appreciate that Cafe Sanuki strives to bring a fast-food styled udon concept to Vegas. Much of the set up is similar to restaurants in Hong Kong where the customer stands in a cafeteria style line, places the order with one of the workers, adds any additional items, and pays at the end of the line with the cashier. There are the sample fake food bowls at the front of the restaurant if you want to see what the food looks like before you order it.   The owner also seems to want to keep this place fresh by holding giveaways, meet a friend nights, etc. Basically a nice place to grab a quick (and healthy) bite to eat before going off on your merry way.   I had the opportunity to dine here twice, and while I appreciated the uniqueness of Cafe Sanuki - customized equipment and machinery brought over to make the best quality udon - I thought the items were too salty, lacking the simplicity of quality udon that I craved.   Beef udon: $7.45 very simple bowl of udon, beef, green onions, and broth. The beef was reminiscent of the beef found in Yoshinoya bowls - pleasantly sweet flavor with enough saltiness to keep you wanting more. Udon was cooked well; the noodles were cooked to the right amount of chewiness. The only thing that was off for me was the broth. I thought it was too salty. I know that this restaurant claims to not use any MSG or artificial ingredients, but that broth was too much - it ended up making the noodles too salty as well. I wasn't able to enjoy the dish as I got towards the end of the bowl.   Curry beef udon: $6.80 I thought maybe it was a fluke the first time I visited, so when I returned, I ordered something different. The udon came in Sanuki's blend of mild beef curry (carrots, onions). It was topped off with a ton of green onions. There was definitely enough flavor, but the curry was way too salty. I felt like the dish was too heavy, punctuated by the heaviness of the curry flavor. The beef and udon were decent though.   Pork belly bao: $2.95 each the bao definitely looked delicious, but again it seemed like it was coated with that heavy flavoring that I got from all the other dishes I've tried. A generous slab of pork belly with Sanuki's homemade slaw inside of the bread - good portion and price point isn't too bad, but I was not a fan of the taste. The slaw and pork belly weren't working together too well for me.   My friend ordered the carbonara udon with a mini beef rice bowl. He also thought the udon was a bit on the salty side and didn't think it was a satisfying meal as he had hoped for. I know a lot of people who do love the noodles here, so I'm not sure if I came on off days or something.   I love their drink area - tons of different soda flavors as well as an unlimited Calpico machine and their own blend of lemonade. They also have favored syrups if you want to customize your drink. If you check in on Yelp, you get a free beverage.   tl;dr - Prices are fair and they have a good amount of items to choose from. Food comes out fairly quickly and the workers are friendly. Unfortunately I just wasn't a big fan of the items that I've tried from here. I do want to return to try the rice rolls and tempura.",

    "text": "Sure sure. I'll be one of the few three star reviews of Cafe Sanuki. I just don't get how serving food cafeteria style is any better than a traditional restaurant unless you're in a mad rush. We ordered our main courses (I got the nabeyaki udon which they informed me would take a few min). That's fine, that's how it should be. Moved on to the sides station and picked up a pumpkin and fish cake tempura, as well as a fish cake and daikon from the oden pot. We grabbed the last gyoza side so we asked if we could order one more and the cashier told us it would take 10-15 min. Okay, I'm already going to wait for my udon so no problem. But the cooks seemed annoyed to have to make more gyoza. I mean.. we're taking the last gyoza shouldn't you make more anyways?   So we sat down and munched on our first gyoza and sides. My mom's niku udon was done before we got out of line so she started eating. My nabeyaki udon and dad's curry came out about 7 min later. When your buzzer goes off they bring you the food so no need to get back up to claim it. The nabeyaki udon was quite good and full of hot ingredients in an adorable pot with handles. I enjoyed the pumpkin and fish cake tempura as well as the daikon. The fish cake from the oden wasn't as good. Hate to say it but it does resemble a warty finger and it's an acquired taste and texture. This is a lot of food so do be cautious with the sides cuz it's easy to grab everything that looks good.   About halfway through our meal the cashier came and told us they just started the gyoza because they forgot. Then she says \"I don't think I charged you for it though\" and looks at our receipt and said that she did. I don't get it. How much do you not want us to have that gyoza?? And that's my main issue with Cafe Sanuki. Most people are used to traditional restaurants, not quick on the go cafeterias you may find in Japan or Asia. We aren't rushing to catch a train, you can take 10 min to make our food. In fact I'd prefer it over grabbing it from under a heat lamp. Honestly the food was better than expected given most of it sat under a heat lamp but still. And I didn't get an option for takoyaki or some of the other sides because they weren't available at the time and who knows what they would have said had I requested they make some. It's like you get what you get given the time you go there. The udon was good and filling and satisfying, but at the end of the day it's just udon. I'm actually surprised they don't serve soba at all. Unless you're in a hurry or are seriously craving udon specifically I don't see a real reason to visit.",

I thought part of the issue that this place was a below par Japanese fast food cafe may be it was due to the \"new\" ness of the operation.   After two + years, my wife and I revisited the place today. Again, our impression was still the same. Nothing to get excited about.   On our first trip to this place, we felt the price is a wee bit high. After two years, they haven't really raised the price and we felt the price is now right in line with other restaurants.  As  a cafe/casual dining restaurant, the interior ambiance is pretty nice. Workers tend to be very helpful. Menu is quite large. One can always find some items that one likes.   The issue is the quality of the food offered. Nothing to get excited about. There are many other noodle places, ramen places that offer a higher quality.  One item that slightly ticked me off was that I ordered a Beef Gyudon.  On the menu it showed that there is an egg. I didn't get mine. When I inquired about that, I was told that is an added item, a dollar extra.  I took offense to that.  If it is not shown on the menu's picture that the Beef Gyudon has an egg,  I am OK with that. But to tell me that it would be a $ extra, it makes me feel that this is a switch and bait tactic, very dishonest advertising.",

Sorry but I didn't intend to do a review so I didn't remember the name of what I ordered . It was the soup with the tempura shrimp inside and the bowl was huge . It's a clean friendly place - just go and discover on your own . I really came here just to post my pictures . I posted the soup and the bao picture . This is a really bad review on my part . Just know I liked it and look at the pics   UPDATE : went last night .  The food is still great , but sadly the customer service was not the best . When I was trying to place my order 2 employees seemed unfamiliar with the menu. One who was standing right in front of me seemed to be staring off into space as if I was invisible and I was right in front of him . Another employee was at his work station eating soup .  I was with a party of three . Orders came sporadic and seperate - so I had to wait with my soup while the other orders eventually came  Once again .. great food but the quality and friendliness of the staff has gone down .",

We decided to come back to give this place a fair chance and then complete a review.   We though we got lucky since there were only 2 other people dining so food should be less rushed, but nope.  The Udon itself was not bad, but the Tempura on the other hand was obviously done well in advance and was not good tasting at all. I personally do not enjoy cold stale Tempura.     Service was better than the first time which is appreciated, however the food was not so can't say I will give them another try.  There are just too many better alternatives in town.",

    "text": "Cafe Sanuki is a Japanese cafeteria style restaurant that specializes in the art of traditional Udon noodles. Their equipment and ingredients are imported from Japan. Prior to opening the restaurant, they met with Udon Masters and even had Minimoto-san spend several months in Vegas training their Chefs to provide an authentic Japanese Udon experience.   I was so excited for Cafe Sanuki so I definitely purchased more food than I could handle. As an appetizer, I decided to get some Tempura items. They have a selection of 10 different types of tempura and you are able to pay per piece per type. I chose Asparagus ($1.25), Pumpkin ($1.25), Sweet Potato ($1.25), Fish Cake ($1.75) and Shrimp ($1.75). The batter was very crispy and I really enjoyed every piece. The tempura is pretty pricey compared to the rest of the menu and since it lays around, it could get a bit oily.   The highlight of my experience is definitely their Udon. With so many options, I struggled to narrow down my choices, but eventually I decided on the #7 Ontama Bukake Udon ($6.45). This is a warm udon noodle with a perfectly poached egg, onions and tempura flakes with the Udon broth on the side. With the broth on the side, your noodles will maintain its' ideal consistency and the tempura flakes won't get soggy if you wait too long to eat it. The noodles were evenly shaped with the perfect amount of elasticity. After I poured in the broth and broke the poached egg, they mixed together and coated the noodles.  It was so delicious, I can't wait to come back for more. I would have been happier if there was more broth though.   With the order of Udon, the small rice bowls are a discount price. I couldn't pass up a good deal for variety so I decided on getting a small Curry Katsu Rice Bowl ($2.50). The curry was a bit lacking by compare but still decent. It was definitely good value.   Take advantage of the Yelp Check-In deal for a free beverage. They have plenty of drink options such as a fancy custom Coke machine, freshly brewed Harney & Sons Tea, special blended Cafe Sanuki Lemonade and even Calpico. Their Drink station even had flavor pumps for you to add to your preference. I just got the Calpico and it was very refreshing with my meal.   Since they are cafeteria style, please remember to take your trays and bowls and put them away. The workers actually went around to help clear finished plates and even when I took my tray to the trash area, they offered to help me put it away. Service was definitely friendly and efficient.   I highly recommend Cafe Sanuki. It was such an incredible meal for a good value. Well, good value if you stick to the udon and small rice bowl. Trust me, even the international Japanese travelers seemed to really enjoy this place.",

    "text": "Coming from the east coast, we are a bit starved for any Japanese offerings other than the hibachi shops serving up grilled meats and rice, or sushi restaurants. We don't get much of anything in the way of noodle shops, especially those making fresh Udon. I was craving it big time while on my trip to Vegas, and went looking on Yelp for a great place. I definitely found one here at Cafe Sanuki!  Absolutely worth a trip off-strip, and a must have for any locals, in my opinion. I couldn't ask for more on my visit. Friendly service, GREAT food, and very inexpensive. I love the format they are going with, which keeps people moving efficiently through the order process and gets them their food quickly.  There is a lot to like here. First and foremost is the delicious Udon noodles made on-site regularly throughout the day. You can get them in all sorts of tasty broths with a variety of spice levels and sauces, or you can even have cold Udon, if you wish. For me, I had a bowl served up in a personal iron kettle with various types of fish, shrimp tempura, a soft boiled egg, and lots and lots of flavor. I also sampled some of the ready to grab items on their hot bar, the fried chicken was excellent and crisp, and my salmon rice roll was good as well.  Another interesting thing about this place is the variety of drinks and teas available, there is something for all desires with just a standard beverage purchase.  I don't know the next time I'll make it out to Vegas, but there is no doubt I will be stopping in here again!",

Basically you order with a person that's cooking and there's a person at the other end being your cashier. While I find it inefficient, I find it culturally cool. The meals range from 8-12 bucks which is reasonable. What I really like about this really comes from the small things. Parking is not ridiculous. The inside is so spacious. And the unlimited drink is not a bad deal for 2.50 considering you can have soda, fresh tea, fresh Lemonade as well as Calpico, a yogurt drink! I order the Nabeyaki udon, which had Tempura, thinly sliced beef, and green onions with udon. It is perfect for those who want to eat a balanced meal. But it might lack the flavor or kick others crave. I would come back for a late night bite or after a dental cleaning.",

In my last review, I had a complaint about the customer service that I had received.   With this visit I was very pleased with the amount of customer service I received. The guy who took my order had very good energy and he was polite. The girl who rung me up was also very polite. She was also patient with me while I pulled up my yelp check in.  The food is never a disappointment here. I had the Katsu Curry and The seasoning was spot on as always. The Katsu was definitely thicker than it used to be so I got full very fast. I love the cafeteria style of this place because I could grab whatever I wanted and since I'm sometimes in the mood for tempura this place is ideal.   This place definitely pleased me so I will be back.  Just a little suggestion for the owners though. If you're staff had name tags it would be easier to call out the ones who should step up and praise the ones who do a great job. Just coming from a Yelpers point of view.",

There's a black gentlemen that greeted us as though we were old friends coming back home for a meal, he took our order, brought our food out, brought out extra plates for my kids, checked on us later to see how are, and then took the plates away...

    "text": "Disappointed!! I had high hopes so we packed up the tyke and drove down to try it out. When I first walked in I was pleasently surprised to see the display of some the dishes available. It reminded me of japan.   We walked up to the line and like a few others needed a moment to review and decide. This caused a confusion because the order area is small and the employees dont direct or assist very well. Wifey ordered kitsune udon and I opted for the big dog nabeyaki udon.  Wifey was direclty handed hers while i was given a little beeper device. We moved onto the tempura and what not's.   The tempura all looked as if it had been out for awhile.. soggy and not much left. Not a great sign considering they had just opened.. microwaved from the night before?  I wanted to have two pieces of sweet potato but there was only two so I left one for the next guy. Grabbed a few items and went to sit down.   Figured udon would be right out so I started to munch on the few items I got. Well, by the time the beeper went i was done. Ran up and got the pot in awkward hand off and made it back to table without spilling hot soup on any og the customers. Seems like the kind of thing liability would dictate the employees bring to you.  This was the first time i have ever had sukiyaki flavored tempura udon with beef in it. Gross.  I must add, typically when you are going to drop a raw egg you should bring the broth to a tempature that could atleast have a chance to cook the egg white.   The line was so long it wasent worth going back up to order anything else.   The last thing I will say and this is a biggie.. it IS NOT appropriate to play the movie blood diamond on the main T.V. in the eating area on a saturday. I really didnt need my kids to see or heat the young child soldier murder the innocent villagers at what seemed like a full volume AK-47.   This place was sadly fail all the way around.",

    "text": "Just arrived in Vegas, which was our first night, I decided to check out Cafe Sanuki for dinner.   There are tons of dining options, when in Vegas and I picked Cafe Sanuki based on the almost 5 stars reviews, food pics, & that its been so long I had Udon soup. Another reason is that I don't want to deal with the lines back in Honolulu  at a place similar to Cafe Sanuki which is Marukame Udon.   The hubby drove me down to Spring Mountain from our hotel. The parking lot was packed that night, but we were able to find a spot farther from Cafe Sanuki. Cafe Sanuki is located in the right corner of this strip mall. Upon entering, the cafe is really cool, feels like I am in Japan, with all the cute fake food display. It is cafeteria style with lots of seating.   I thought that from reading the reviews, tips, & photos, I would be ready to order, but I still took awhile to decide. Too many choices! We placed our order and here is where my complaints begin. Our order were: Curry Udon (6.80) Kitsune Udon, (6.45) add egg (1.00) add mini curry rice (2.50) Fish cake tempura (1.75) sweet potato tempura (1.25). When I paid for my food, I didn't get the mini curry. When I asked cashier, Gabby, she asked, did you get a beeper? No beeper, did not receive one, so she said she will bring it out. 5 mins pass, 7 mins pass by, I still don't see my mini curry. I walked by the register to ask about it and Gabby said that they are prepping it, because they have to cook it. I noticed 2 other table that ordered the big bowl curry received theirs. I also see the pot of already made curry sauce. Gabby wasn't very friendly and talking back to customer isn't 5 stars in my opinion. She cannot admit that she forgot about my order. The entire time waiting for my curry my Udon soup was cold. I received my Udon soup lukewarm so the egg didn't really cook, the egg was still raw which I can't stand.  Overall, my other half enjoyed his meal. The soup wasn't too salty which is good. Cafe Sanuki is an awesome addition to Las Vegas and cheap. My visit was a disappointment. Happy that I can cross this off my bookmarks.   Oh, FYI/ Free drink with Yelp check in & super cool that they have a Self serve Calpico yogurt drink.",

The broth (Niku and nabeyaki) was very watered down, didn't have the homey richness I was craving. The tan tan udon was okay, just salty, not much depth in flavor also, just kinda like spicy salt with a little miso in it. All the fried stuff was cold despite being under heat lamps . Maybe it was because it was slower but it didn't satiate my appetite. The udon noodles itself wasn't that great. It did not have the silky chewy springy texture, it was kinda just mushy. Oh but the poached egg was cooked perfectly .",

    "text": "My lovely Japanese friend took me to experience Cafe Sanuki for the first time. Don't let the casual cafeteria setting fool you, the delicious food is paired with great service!  As you enter the restaurant, there's a huge glass case with all the labeled food options on display. Gotta love the instant visual upon arrival. At first, we weren't sure how everything worked (we were too busy staring at the food display). One of the staff approached us with a menu and explained: the food options are numbered, take a tray and fall in line to order and pay. Ordering is similar to places like Jason's Deli, but the kitchen is in full view to see your food being made to order. Plus everyone is engaging and friendly, even with all of our questions. Just before you pay there's a little station with tempura veggies and onigiri, ready to grab right away. After paying the drink station is close by, then you pick a table and wait for the beeper to sound off.  I ordered the nabiaki udon dish, braised pork rice bowl, salmon onigiri and pumpkin tempura. The portions are generous, and I was pleased with all the flavors. I had the pleasure of rolling my own onigiri, thank goodness it comes with instructions! The great service we received was a nice surprise. The staff walked around inquiring how the food was, and would offer to get things for you, which I haven't usually experienced in cafeteria style restaurants. The ambiance is nice as well, and everything was kept clean.  I'm definitely impressed with the staff's attentive demeanor in a casual setting and will frequent this place, thank you Cafe Sanuki!",

    "text": "Every experience I've had here has been underwhelming. We came here on a Wednesday afternoon around noon before the lunch rush. The restaurant is big with a cafeteria style set up. You order w/ the cashier and grab any hot items that are available for purchase on the counter like different types of tempura. There's ample seating.  Food  Seafood Tomato Cream: The tomato sauce was good. The sauce came with shrimp, squid, fish and mussel. All were good except the mussel was overcooked and chewy. The udon was extremely overcooked as well. I would order this bowl again but request to hold off on the mussel and request they not overcook the udon if I came back here again.   Carbonara Udon: Lacks flavor. Overcooked Udon again. I wouldn't order this again.   Pork Belly Bun: This was so terrible the lady remade it for me after seeing my face when I bit into the pork belly bun. THAT'S HOW BAD IT WAS! The pork belly was chewy. There wasn't any flavor. The bun was dry and hard on the outside. The new pork belly bun the server gave me was slightly better. She said sorry for how terrible the first one was because they forgot to put sauce on it. However, I will give them a pass on this because of how well they treated us. To offer to remake a dish shows they care about their customers.   Price   Inexpensive and probably one of the cheapest udon places in Las Vegas.  This entire meal was $35 w/ taxes and tip.   Service   Excellent, which is why I would return here again because I am sure they'll follow instructions well had I expressed I wanted the mussels removed and the udon not overcooked.   Overall, it was an okay meal. I would return again for one more try... but if that one is a bust then I will not come back again. I think a handful of visits should be enough to know if a restaurant fits your taste buds.   Happy Dining,  JT",

I suppose next time I will just have it without the fishcakes. I had the spam onigiri as well. I liked how there was instructions on how to open it. It is cafeteria-like and people get the food fast. The person who I ordered through told me that someone will bring my dish to me when it is done but one of the staffs came to me and said my dish is ready so go pick it up myself. I thought that was strange that I was told something different than what I am supposed to do but it was okay. I think this will be a good place for anyone looking for a quick lunch.",

    "text": "First impression, great decor and environment. For the food, ehh. I ordered a #7, thinking that it would come with soup because that is how it is shown in display and on the menu. However when it was served, there was no soup and the noodles were warm. I was also served a sauce in it's container but no hot soup was with my order. So I thought maybe the sauce would be enough to act as a soup to dip my noodles in, but come to find out, the container was already empty... At this point I was very confused and realized my order was not correct. By the time I spoke with one of the workers and they gave me the hot broth, my noodles were cold so the broth did not settle well with the now lukewarm soup.  I never really ever complain about food. It was just really confusing because the customer after me ordered #7 as well and we both didn't get a hot broth or soup to begin with. This makes me question if the kitchen has been serving this dish without it's hot broth or soup. I expected it to be in the bowl with the noodles served hot, just as the menu depicts it.  To end this review on a better note, at least they got my boyfriend's order correct. He ordered a #10, which they had to bring out to our table. The lemonade is also different from other lemonades I've tried, interesting flavor.  Maybe we caught them on a bad lunch shift, so maybe next time I'll have a better experience.",

She likens the atmosphere and food as being like what you would find at a Japanese train station.  Amazing fill up food for a long journey.  I love the models of each dish in the front to \"see\" before you order.  The line passing the udon making station and the little to no wait for your food.   Getting to pick and choose the tempura was a fun experience.  And the Cafe Sanuki lemonade is the perfect tartness and not too sweet.  Add some Torani flavors if you want or use it for 1 of 3 ice teas in the fountain.  We ended up getting the Kamaage udon which was sooo much food.  But this was the best for judging taste of the noodles. And the clam udon which was so yummy.  Tempuras-asparagus, zucchini, squid, fish cake cake and shrimp they were all good for the squid was the best. Not too chewy but very tender.    All in all I would go back multiple Times!",

The woman who worked the cashier told three people who were sitting at a table that they could now order when it opened. She looked at me standing at the door and just ignored me, walking back to the register area. I walked over there and was a bit confused about the ordering system. I apologized and said it was my first time. She assumed I had been there before. I was confused about the sides she was asking if I wanted. For that reason, I thought maybe I had to build my udon bowel. From the picture, it appeared that it included all the necessary ingredients that were in the picture. I guess the sides were if people wanted more tempura, etc. in their udon. In the picture, it seemed it had more than enough ingredients, so I passed on the sides. They need to explain their process a bit. Finally, I got the udon. It was just OK. It was a bit salty and didn't have a smooth-tasting dashi base. I really do miss the simplicity in food that I found in Japan. There is another place in town that comes closer to authentic Japanese udon.",

Albeit the food was on the cheaper end so I feel like what you get is what you pay for. They have a unique lemonade drink that they say they make but i think it really is just mixed with calpico. Come here for just good food and to get full.   The food is not bad. It's good and average but don't expect 5 star quality. The servers are nice and their drinks have free refills. I didn't come during peak hours and this was my last meal before heading to the airport (which was a little unfortunate).   Plenty of parking but can be hidden depending on where you're coming from due to the gas station right on the corner of the parking lot.  EDIT: the business owner replied and said their housemade lemonade has no calpico in it, I respect that. He also said they make their noodles in-house fresh daily, and I agree with that because I did see this for myself but have forgotten.",

Good portion and just lots of flavor. The noodles are soft and perfect.   The katsu was very good. The pork had a nice crispy breading and tasted great mixed with the rice and curry.

The pricing for each of their entrees are the best bang for buck since the cost is low and the quality is high. The employees are friendly and efficient as the wait time for food was minimal even during busy hours. The menu is very diverse and doesn't just appeal to soup lovers. I recommend Cafe Sanuki to anyone who wants some quality Asian food for a cheap price!",

The restaurant is self service style. Order at the counter, wait for you food or get a pager to wait for your food at the table and then pay. The hot noodle soups are always steaming hot and tastes healthy and good. The fry station at the counter has a few fried foods ready made to pick up such as shrimp tempura, fried chicken and vegetable tempura. If the tempura were steaming hot and fresh it would be the best. Overall a great casual place to go for a quick and good meal with friendly staff.",

The noodles are great. I love the way the ordering system works too. It's not your usual place where you have to wait on someone to come over to get some more food. It's more cafeteria style, but doesn't feel like a fast food place at all. As you wait in line, you also get to see the chefs working on the noodles. It's pretty cool!  The first thing I ever ordered was Kake Udon, since it's just about the plainest you can get, and they did right by it. On another occasion, I ordered the Braised Pork Belly rice bowl, along with some Kakiage tempura. Once I was done with the pork, I mixed in the Kakiage into the remaining rice, and it was to die for!  Each time I visit, I also order Kombu Onigiri. I can't go without one! Husband swears by the Spam Onigiri. The Pork Belly Bun is great too.  Lastly, whenever they have it available, I try to snag some Taiyaki.",

Few things to take note :  1-We order the pork belly baos, chef came out minutes after purchasing that he was out of pork belly baos.   2- We got 2 mini bowls in place of the \"pork belly baos\" which really didn't solve anything.   3-Included in the order was also katsu curry bowl that was long delayed. Went to cashier and she said they forgot the order. Took about another 40 minutes for that dish to come out.  4-The buzzer buzzed i walked up to get the food as I'm reaching for the dish I was told it wasn't for me they buzzed the wrong number.   5. Was told one of the chef walked out on them earlier in the day and they're short staffed, but there was 6 people behind the counter at 8pm with only 3 other customers. Hmm.   Overall, good food but lousy experience.",

I've been wanting to find more Japanese restaurants like I'm used to in LA, and Sanuki caught my interest. Ramen seems to get all of the love, so it's nice to have a place that serves good udon. All of the employees were super nice and helpful! The restaurant was very clean, and larger than I thought it would be. I had the Nikku Beef Udon, some assorted Tempura and a couple of Rice Rolls. I definitely enjoyed all of my food! The udon was chewy in the way it should be, and the soup was light and flavorful. Make sure to order it with an egg! The tempura was crispy and rice rolls were even better than the ones from Mitsuwa in LA. Looking forward to cooler weather, when hot udon tastes best! I'm sure I'll be back before then.",

    "text": "Very Tasty! (and huge udon bowls too!)  My friend and I walked in around noon on a Thursday... it was pretty quiet and just a couple folks enjoying their bowls which was good because my GF has an enthusiastic 11 month old who hasn't learned her \"indoor voice\" yet.  haha!  We were immediately greeted by a nice gentleman who welcomed us in and explained the menu, answered our questions about different dishes and took our order.  Actually... we told him and he shouted it back to the kitchen staff.  When that place gets busy, I'm not sure how that works out cuz I can see it getting noisy in there.  Anyways...you order some of the menu with him and then there's a buffet style area with prepared small dishes such as tempura and rice ball-things (I can't remember what they were but they looked like what my grandma would make for snacks... which were in essence rice-balls with stuff in them.)  Drinks are self serve, as is seating so you can pick where you want to sit, and then they'll bring your food out to you.  I had a big bowl of one of their popular ones...Nabiaki Udon. The beef broth was fabulous.  Hot, lots of rich flavor, just the right amount of saltiness.  Lots of noodles, shredded beef, a shrimp tempura, an egg, a couple slices of fish cake... So ONO! My GF got a spicy pork shoyu udon bowl... and it was totally different from mine.  We were trying to share but because the flavors were so different (in a good way) that we each ended up just eating our own.  But the pork belly that was in hers was fantastic! The pork bello bao we ordered was good.  We were chatting too much and it got cold. I think it would have been better hot.  Next time we'll know better. Each of us didn't finish our bowls but we put a pretty good dent in them.   If you plan on getting other sides, you can probably share 1 bowl for 2 people.  Service was really nice.  The staff checked up on us a couple times to see if we needed anything else.  If it was closer to where I live, this would probably be a regular stop for me.",

I also ordered a pork belly bao which I had to take home because my portion of the curry was pretty big! The plates and bowls are HUGE. It was almost difficult trying to eat inside my oversized bowl, but the food was so good that I didn't care.   On top of it, if you check in, you get a free drink! They have a wide variety of drinks.

The menu has quite a variety, and the experience is great.  You grab a tray and then proceed to order what you like with regards to your main noodle dish. You watch them as they prepare it and afterwards you collect and proceed to checkout. On the way, there's additional small bites as well as a tempura bar that is all priced a la carte... Get what pieces you want and they'll add it up. it is all very cafeteria-like.  Their creamy lemonade is very interesting and has an interesting flavor. I believe they use sweet condensed milk in their recipe that adds the creaminess they advertise as well as that additional sweetness. They also serve Calpico and it's all refills!

Like Shakeshake!   I prefer their carbonara and cheesy carbonara over the traditional soup noodles (i.e. ). Although the cheese makes it heavy. Also the drink bar is bomb! Mix anything you want  There's nice decor and a big tv! Nice to watch, had family guy and American dad when I went. There's a long bar to sit at if you're a loner like at Ramen bar shops.",

This place is perfect for all seasons :) hot or cold options for everyone!!! When you enter, you grab a tray and tell your order at the order window. You continue down and the staff maybor may not hand you noodles, dipping sauce, or your hot udon. It all depends on the prep time they need. It is QUICK though. Once you turn after that, you will see the fried goodies such as tempura shrimp, fish, veggies, etc. CHICKEN KARAGE IS SO GOOD.  Grab it to share!!!! I felt like the takoyaki was slightly overcooked though.  --Mujina cold noodle ($7.80) super filling! I also had some appetizers, so i think it would be the perfect serving by itseld. The sauce you pour over it is amazingly flavorful. I thought it wasnt enough but they give you the perfect amount.  --Nabeyaki: my boyfriend ordered this and i thought it was delicious, but i definitely prefer the cold noodle since we are going into summer and it's freakin hitting triple digits outside.  Highly recommend. I came right when the opened so there wasnt really a line. There is a LOT of seating inside. You almost feel like youre in a cafeteria. e n j o y",

    "text": "Loving this replica of a typical Japanese cafeteria with delicious udon noodles.  You enter and are greeted by sample dishes behind a glass.  It is delightfully weird, and apparently traditional.  You go to your right, pick up a charming wooden tray and then order from a paper menu or the board.  You can interact with a young man who can explain everything to you. And then as you go along the station, you have the option of adding tempura to your tray on a little plate.  Don't forget to pick up the free condiment of colored sea salt.  At the end you pay, and you can add drinks.     We ordered the beef udon noodles, a pork version, and a couple other dishes.  The beef udon was warm and filled with umami.  The tempura was at first just okay, but if you dipped it in the little sea salt, it really brightened up the flavor.  The other dishes were good, as well.   The drinks are interesting.  There is a Coke machine that also has \"fizzy\" healthy drinks, as well as iced tea in 2 flavors (unsweetened), and a very fine lemonade.  Service is very good, particularly for what is essentially a \"fast food\" place.  It is clean and well-organized. Prices were not SUPER cheap, but reasonable, and probably not as expensive as the comparable place in Japan.  Popular with families.  I had no complaints.",

I was a few bites into my food when I found HAIR in the beef!! If you ever had their rice bowls to-go you'll know they put the meat and the rice in separate containers. When I scooped some meat to my rice container I found hair along with the meat!! I called to let them know and they told me to just go back with the food and they'll give me a new one. Went in there and got my meal replaced with a new one, that's it. I didn't expect to get compensated with free food/refund or anything but I did expect an APOLOGY for even finding that in my food. People in the back looked annoyed and so did the lady on the register. Definitely won't be coming back if they're so careless with their food.",

Cafe Sanuki is similarly modeled to Marukame, with cafeteria style trays and self serve tempura. Unlike Marukame however, the tempura was not fresh and seemed to have been sitting out for quite some time. This is definitely one of the drawbacks of having a cafeteria style restaurant. Additionally, the noodles/soup did not seem as fresh as Marukame. We ordered the Nabeyaki & Carbonara udon. Both of our dishes came out slightly warm rather than piping hot.  TLDR Cafe Sanuki is OK at best for a quick udon fix. Nothing too special here.  If you're craving good udon, I suggest oodle noodle down the street for freshly prepared food that hasn't been sitting out.",

    "text": "TIP: Free drink w/ Yelp check in! (They have those soda machine that you can customize your drink, calpico, and a bunch of lemonade and teas.)  After a long night out at the club, we were craving some soup the next day for lunch. Decided to come here since it resembled Marugame Udon and Marugame Monzo in LA.   ENVIRONMENT: Located in Chinatown (about 5~ min from the strip). The interior of this place is modern, yet authentic.  Upon entering, you're greeted by this big display of fake udon bowls for you to preview their menu.  The staff were pretty efficient! However, I felt like there was no need for the buzzer since the staff brings out the bowl to you anyways. Maybe just a number sign is sufficient enough.   UDON: They offer traditional bowls and some unique ones, like the carbonara. I had a bite of #14 cheesy carbonara, which is baked udon in a cream sauce. The flavors were all there, but extremely oily. There was a pool of oil at the bottom of the bowl. I ordered #3 Niku Beef Udon. The broth was extremely salty. I had to drink so much water... They were very generous with the beef though! My bf ordered #2 Nabeyaki Udon, and I would recommend that over the beef udon because it had more components (beef, egg, shrimp tempura, fish cake) and the broth was less salty.   RICE BOWL: I tried the braised pork rice bowl. It definitely needs some sauce to go with the pork because it was so dry. It was flavorful though, just very dry.   ONIGIRI (RICE BALL): I tried the tuna mayo onigiri and it was not bad. Nicely salted and decently flavored. The amount of meat wasn't much inside, but it was still a great snack.   OVERALL: This place has a plethora of udons to choose from! If you have a big appetite, you can order double noodles for $2 or add a mini rice bowl for $2.50. I love that the udon is freshly made. Although the broth was salty, it definitely hit the spot for the most part and I was content!",

I'm like 90% sure it's the same restaurant that the owner of Cafe Sanuki visited and became inspired to open his own! Prior to my visit, I've been constantly checking out their yelp page, drooling at the images posted by other fellow yelpers. Finally, last week my boyfriend and I found the time to check it out. I tried their beef udon and it was just heaven in my mouth. I also love  the idea of picking out tempura, although I have one slight complaint about it...it was a bummer that the tempura was kind of cold..my guess from sitting out for too long since it is served cafeteria style. It's definitely not something that would stop me from coming back, because I assure you, I will be back. But I hope that they'll do something about maintaining the tempura temperature or something!   Amazing service as well. I was greeted instantly and was well informed of how to order and everything.   Definitely recommend this place to anyone!!",

He was standing in the middle of the walkway to additional tables while talking to some guests and just wouldn't make way for me to pass. I had to get up and down getting stuff from the utensil station since there was nothing at the tables and had to pass him every time but he never made notice that he was blocking the way or apologize. I actually had to walk around to the other side to get past him to my seat on one occasion.  Later I heard him speaking rudely to his workers, which I don't appreciate.

My wife and I order the Kanuki udon and the curry udon, the guy that was frying the tempura offered to fry us up fresh stuff so we got the shrimp and sweet potato tempura with a spam onigiri, tuna mayo onigiri, and salmon onigiri. The spam onigiri was a little old tasting like it was sitting out all day because the spam was turning gray.  We love the whole atmosphere and brought me back to shirokiya memories in Hawaii. This is by far the best udon I've had in such a long time. It's made the way they do it in Sanuki Japan. The noodles pick up the flavor of the broth which makes it taste great.  We will be back here to try out more on the menu because they all look so ono (delicious).",

    "text": "KNOCK OFF ALERT!  And it's a great thing.   Cafe Sanuki is a knock off of Japan's largest udon chain Marugame (for Hawaii yeeps, think our own knock off, Marukame).    Also guessing it's Chinese and not Japanese (kunbu - Chinese on the menu vs KONBU - Japanese).  It doesn't matter as many everyday noodle shops in Japan are Chinese.  Making this place \"authentic\".  Go fig.  Machine made, glutinous and chewy, properly cooked udon.  Very basic Sanuki broth (lighter style, soy added to a simple bonito / konbu (dried fish / dried kelp) broth).  Ordered cafeteria style, pickup a few pieces of tempura and a musubi, pay and eat.  In and out in 10 minutes without making a dent in your wallet.  The kake (finished broth) and bukake (stop it, dirty minds - add your own concentrated broth) easily the best and the best value at $5.55.  Variants include adding meat (niku), egg (kamatama) and cold (zaru).  Lots of yoshoku and silly Americanized combos as well.  None sampled.  Seriously?  Seafood tomato cream udon?  Very ordinary tempura.  Excessively oily, over cooked, somewhat rubbery from having the batter over mixed.  You get what you pay for.  For between $1 - $2 all good.  Musubis also just OK.  Everyday short grain rice, typical \"fillings\" (spicy tuna, tuna with mayo, plum, spam), crisp laver surrounding it.  Over compacted but flavorful inari (cone sushi).  Again, sub $2, what do you expect.    New, clean and friendly service.  Solid, quick and cheap just as it should be.",

Anyways at first their whole setup was a teeny bit confusing, you have to pick a tray and pick out your main dish, then you set it down at the ticket holder then you are given the option to go and pick up mini sides like Tempura, onigiri, takiyaki, etc! They give you a timer to let you know when your meal is finished!  Once they have completed your meal, you will hear a buzzer notifying you to receive your food.  Finish and pay and you are good to go!  Honestly let me tell you how spacious and nice the interior is!  Many, many tables! Along with a wall of Manga, and other things you can use!  I ordered the Miso garlic pork belly along with a mini chicken Katsu plate!  My sides included 2 Takiyaki and one onigiri! I highly recommend the Taiyaki! The breading was insanely soft and the you can definitely taste the red bean!  I'm so glad I found this place, I will return without a doubt!",

Either we stick to the same old ramen joint we been going to, try out a new ramen joint, or savor in on some Udon! Being that my friends and I are from Hawaii, I heard Cafe Sanuki brought the idea of bringing back Marukame Udon from Hawaii but in their own style. We were awed by their gigantic display of all their specialties preserved behind glass. - this gives good visual on how big their dishes are and to bring out the watery mouths to try out everything. So that is what we practically did. The ordering line was very simple; grab a tray, look at the digital menu if you haven't looked at the paper menu, and then choose to your liking. Sanuki is a Japanese traditional restaurant and provide their hospitality as they would back east. Always open to offer assistance for those who have a hard time deciding what to order. We had no problem with ordering everything they had! I love to mention that they also have packaged flavored onigiri you can grab off the shelf for cheap, not to mention additional toppings for your bowls and tempura appetizers.   If you check into yelp, you get a free beverage! Try their Calpico yogurt drinks with flavored pumps!! Forget their soda dispensers and yolo!! Don't forget to also use their Exclusive coupon to get 10% off on your order!!",

My husband and I tried Yaki Udon (stir fried) and Nabeyaki Udon (Udon with broth in a special serving pot). They were both good with large serving size. Yaki Udon was 7.45 and Nabeyakin Udon was 9.45. They are both great value.  You pick your udon and side dishes and pay at the counter. They will give you a pager to beep you when your food is ready to pick up at the counter. Their system is pretty close to \"Hanamaru Udon\" chain in Japan which is my favorite.  I am a Japanese and have been back to Japan many times in recent years. Their Japanese style udon is authentic. I am not quite sure about Cabonara or Tomato sauce udon, but may be I will be brave and try next time.   The restaurant is spacious and clean with great service (although it's self-serve, the workers were attentive and offered to clean up our table).  I will go back there again.

    "text": "This place was so great! I liked that you could pretty much customize your food. Your udon can be simple or really extra, it's totally up to you! So how it works, start with your udon and then you can add things like tempura, chicken karrage, or hand rolls. You can add as many or as few at you like! Are you more of a visual person and now sure what to get? That's ok! Because right when you walk in, you are greeted with a beautiful cased display of what they have to offer.   I ordered the #2 and added shrimp tempura, some veggies tempura and a tuna mayo hand roll. It was all really good! Definitely no complaints!   One thing that I really like about this place was their customer service! Their AC was down so it was pretty hot in there. So to accommodate everyone, they offered everyone a free drink and a couple for 50% off their next visit. How awesome is that?",

My friends, who are locals in Vegas, recommended Cafe Sanuki for dinner on a Sunday night. It was nice and empty when we arrived at about 8pm. The restaurant is cafeteria style, so it took a while to figure out what to order and to feel comfortable enough to get in line and place our orders.   One of the workers kindly came over and asked if we had been there before and instructed us to grab a tray, make our selection at the counter, and continue on to pick any tempura or hand rolls to add to our order. I ordered the carbonara udon with a mini order of katsu curry to share with my boyfriend. I was given a pager which beeped even before I had reached my table, and an employee brought my bowl over to me and put it on my tray. The udon was more like an alfredo than a carbonara, but delicious nonetheless. I took about a third of my meal to-go.  During our visit, I probably drank about 3 cups of their special lemonade, which we thought was a combination of lemonade and Calpico. I'm still dreaming of the beverage to this day. Make sure to refill your cup before you leave so you can enjoy it on your way home or even the day after!",

We were very hungry, so after checking our luggage in, we searched for a Japanese restaurant that was both close to the airport and inexpensive. We yelped for a while and we found this restaurant! And I'm sure glad we did.   When you first enter the restaurant, you're greeted with a nice display case filled with vibrant-colored appetizing-looking food models and prices. The food service is also incredibly fast. It's cafeteria style so you grab a tray and order what you want. In this case ontama udon and miso garlic pork belly ($7.95 each). Then as you go down the line, there's various tempura and rice rolls varying in prices. For example a single shrimp tempura was about $1.25. Our total was about $25 and the portions were filling. Also if you're a first time visitor, they'll give you complimentary soup to wash everything down. The food was delicious and for the price you pay, you can't beat that. The customer service was fun and friendly.   If you have time to kill and looking for a nearby Japanese restaurant (from the airport) that serves quality food for an inexpensive price, then I highly recommend Cafe Sanuki",

    "text": "Cafe Sanuki is a great new udon spot to compete with the recent wave of udon openings in the area. This place takes udon and throws a Chipotle-style customize-your-own bowl spin to it. On top of that, the most basic styles are an affordable $5-6. You can then add toppings and side dishes such as onigiri and various tempura to your bowl for $1.75ish.   I tried the curry beef udon with a large skewer of chicken tempura (three big pieces) and fish cake tempura. The curry was flavorful and had lots of pieces of beef. I was surprised by how well-cooked the udon noodles were. The small bowl of miso garlic pork belly on top of rice was also quite flavorful and crispy. It would've been nicer if the slices of pork belly weren't so thin. Everything came very fast and efficiently - the Japanese way. However, some udon bowls that my friends ordered did take longer to make. The beverage station has a number of different drinks including Calpico, lemonade, and a Coca-Cola Freestyle machine.   The one downside was that many of the pieces of tempura became very soggy. I enjoyed my piece of fish cake tempura as it had just come out of the frier, but everything else including the onion blossom and the chicken had that soggy texture that oozed with leftover oil as you bit into it. Still a great deal overall, especially if you can time it to get the tempura fresh.",

After paying, its seat yourself so go ahead and grab a table!  The service here is absolutely wonderful! The front cashier was exceptional and very upbeat. She helped clear our tables and just made it a really good first experience even though they're not a service restaurant.   I tried the:  Seafood Udon - very tasty.

    "text": "When I first heard about this place was through a group of friends. My initial response was, \"Snooki from MTV Jersey Shore opened up a restaurant.\" However, I quickly learned it was pronounced Cafe Sa-Nu-Ki, Lol. Its a Japanese restaurant with emphasis on Udon.  The ambience reminds me of Shirokiya Japanese Village at Ala Moana Shopping Center in Hawaii. Its a large food hall/beer garden with tons of Japanese food vendors. Especially the fake plastic display case in front, which is common at Japanese restaurants.   Cafe Sanuki set up is a cafetaria style, where you place an order from a numbering system then your order is prepared fresh in front of you. There is side dishes like Tempura, Onigiri(Rice balls) that you can add on. There are other items that require a wait time. For those items, your given a pager and the staff will call you once its ready at the cash wrap/pick up station.   The food is really good and very authentic to what you expect from Japanese Udon. I personally enjoy the Kamatama and Kitsune Udon and the Yaki Udon. Portions is quite filing, considering Udon is more thick than ramen. Another cool feature is that they have rice bowls in regular and mini sizes, great for sharing or if your feeling really hungry.  A few times, we had the pleasure of meeting with the owner, Henry Fan. Nice guy who is compassionate with his restaurant. He made sure our visits were good and everything was up to our satisfaction. Overall, a great place to have a meal with friends and family in a cool setting.  2018 Yelp Review #8",

It has a familiar taste with the Italian cream sauce but with noodles that are bigger. Niku Beef Udon - 4/5 Stars - the Sanuki broth with the seasoned beef and onions warms you up on those cold fall/winter nights. I added a poached egg, 2 shrimp tempuras, squid tempura, and a fish cake tempura to my bowl. Everything tasted fine except the beef. For some reason, the beef had a weird taste to it. But the one thing I did like about the beef was how tender it was! It was incredibly soft and wasn't hard to chew.  --- Overall - 5/5 Stars - I love coming here and trying something new each time. I recommend this to a lot of my friends and it never disappoints. There's plenty of seating and the ambiance makes you feel like you're in Japan! The refillable Calpico drink is the cherry on top here. Calpico bottles can range from $2 to $3 and getting a refillable Calpico here is a steal!",

We've been seriously a fan since soft opening.  Sometimes I get the kake udon. But last night I got the mentaiko udon. It was so delicious.  My boyfriend got the seafood udon, which also was so good! Both reminded me of a Japanese pasta.  We always get the onigiri. The Japanese girl told me they make it fresh everyday! We also got to try the strawberry red bean dessert also made by a sweet Japanese lady that works there. It was not too sweet and it just hit the spot!!  This place is the best for that soup/ noodle craving! Not too heavy and the taste will make it so satisfying! Thank you cafe sanuki!",

Parking was plentiful and restaurant was clean and large enough to fit a football team. I got the nabeyaki udon. The dashi was on point with great body and a hint of sweetness! The tempura was light and crispy and great as well! Now for the bad. The udon noodles themselves were mushy. I even asked them to please make another bowl and to have the noodles chewy but the result was the same. The staff was very friendly in getting me to try a second bowl. I've been to the restaurant that Mr Fan first went to in Waikiki and the noodles there and also Jumbo and Iyo were both firm and chewy. I haven't been to the Sanuki region of Japan so maybe its supposed to be mushy?? In either case I would have definitely given a 5 star rating if the noodles (which should be the star of the show) weren't mushy. Everything else was great!!",

So I went up to ask about our order and come to find out it was never placed even though I had already paid for it.  Less than five mins our food comes with a ton of rice and less meat.

Although they were good, they sat out for a while so they weren't as warm and they were a little soggy. You can also get a drink for free by checking in so why not? You can get a soda from the fancy coke machine where you can concoct any soda.",

The upside was that you could see what was in the Curry, like veggies and sliced beef. The bao was good and the side of tempura squid was succulent but cold. Prices are great.

Richard even goes above and offered me the curry because I was hesitance of ordering it again from my first experiences but he let me try it and I must say they improve the texture and taste of their curry. So tonight we ordered Seafood Tomato Cream, Yaki Udon and Katy's Curry Rice with some tempuras on the side (Shrimp, Fish cake & Chicken) EVERYTHING WAS GOOD! But most importantly the service we received from Richard was make this dinner memorable, next time we come back we are looking forward to explore other items on their menu.

Our food order is incorrect more often than not, they advertise some food that I have yet to see available, and despite closing in the middle of the day to clean and restock ... they seem to use an awful lot of pre-packaged vegetables, can't quite keep things in stock, and don't appear to have the time to train employees on ingredients to answer questions when asked or, especially after our last experience just tonight, on customer service either.   A lot of people seem to love it here, and regretfully ... I cannot figure out why.",

My friend was raving about this one udon place in Hawaii so I decided to have lunch with them here, & she said it's very similar to it.  Style of ordering: it's like a cafeteria style. Basically, it's not your norm sit and take order type of noodle place. You pick what you want, you go in line, you pay.. then you find a table.  I think it's such a cool concept and I love the fact that they make the noodles fresh AND in front of you! :) I got the miso pork rice bowl (wasn't very impress, I'd give it a 6/10) and my friends got the hot soup noodles. The ones they got are great and the broth are super yummy! After getting your main course, you also get the pick your side dishes and even this red bean dessert. The tempura and rice cakes are bombbbbb! The red bean dessert..not so much :( it was a little stale and tasted like it's been sitting out for a long time.  Over all, the whole experience was awesome. Make sure to check in for your free drink ;) get some of their signature lemonade and add some flavor to it. I did mango lemonade, cause .. ITS MANGO! Lol who doesn't love mango flavored anything. The staff were nice and super helpful",

So comfy, you grab your tray and just sit down with a big bowl of warmth. The food practically embraces you with a hug of the soul. I grabbed the seafood udon in a creamy tomato based sauce, my palate was coated with umami and I accompanied it with a small pork belly rice bowl. Got the free drink with a yelp check in and the drink selection, my goodness the drink selection. They have the calico yogurt drinks on tap, you know the little mini yogurt drink that you suck down 5 at a time? Yeah, you can have that as a drink. And their lemonade, so addicting, not too sweet, mellow creaminess, I drank 2 full cups of the stuff and it wasn't overbearing.I'm not a soda kind of guy so I'm happy they had other things, but if soda is your thing they have the awesome 140+ flavors coke machines so go mix and a matching. Anyways, definitely a new favorite spot, can't wait to come back.",

    "text": "If you are a fan of udon noodles or want to try udon for the first time, do yourself a favor and visit a proper udon house rather than have udon from a sushi restaurant. Sanuki makes their noodles in-house so the flavor and texture will be superior to anywhere else that doesn't make it fresh.  Niku (beef) udon: Traditional udon broth with beef and onions on top. The broth is flavorful without being too salty. The beef was thinly sliced and was a little more fatty than I prefer but still not bad.   Seafood tomato udon: A modern twist on udon, definitely my favorite between the two bowls I ordered. The udon comes in a tomato cream sauce rather than broth. The seafood was perfectly cooked. The sauce is light and pleasing without being overly acidic. Imagine a great seafood tomato-based pasta dish and replace the pasta with fresh udon noodles.   Extras: Soft boiled egg tempura: I enjoyed having this with the niku udon. The yolk was not too runny and the tempura batter was crunchy without being salty. Fish cake tempura: I like fish cake and I enjoyed the texture difference of a soft fish cake center with a crunchy tempura shell.   Lemonade: Love the flavor but beware this lemonade has dairy in it. I'm lactose-intolerant and didn't know it had dairy until I asked.",

I saw a few pictures and was immediately SOLD to come try them out lol.  I was actually imagining a small hole in the wall full service restaurant.  So instead, the restaurant was bright, clean, with happy and friendly staff.  It's like a futuristic cafeteria you'd see in sci fi movies.  We tried an udon bowl (it was huge), a curry bowl, a beef over rice bowl, and a pork belly bao.  Everything tasted good.  For the price point, the nice staff, the large and clean dining area, and pretty tasty food, I am definitely a fan.",

When we heard about the soft opening deal, we decided to sign up and try their meals. At first, I thought this was going to be a sit down cafe type of restaurant; unexpectedly, however, Cafe Sanuki had a food court style type of feel since we had to go to an area to order our meals and have a seat anywhere we wanted. The restaurant was also a lot larger than we expected and could accommodate around 100 people.  For my meal, I decided to get the seafood creamy udon and two shrimp tempuras because I was craving seafood that day. For the price that the udon was set at, I definitely received a lot more noodles and seafood than I expected. At other udon places, I have paid around $13 for less food than I could get at Cafe Sanuki at $10. I liked the variety of seafood that the meal offered, and the udon had a nice chewy texture.  I am looking forward to trying their other dishes in the future because I enjoyed the amount of food and price of my meal. Thank you Cafe Sanuki for inviting me to your pre-grand opening celebration!",

The broth was good and portion was generous. Meal came with beef/tempura/egg/veggies. It was a great meal if you are looking for something soupy. I didn't try the beef udon and pork bun was nice but wasn't the star of my dinner. Best thing about this place is the customer service.

The non-soup based udon dishes are ok. Nothing special. The curry is pretty good, but it's kind of sad that a place who specializes in udon has their main dish overshadowed by curry. The katsu was a little soggy, but the beef in the curry was a nice touch.  Their creamy lemonade is good, so don't forget to check in to get a free drink!  Would I come back? Unless their udon improves, it's highly unlikely.",

    "text": "Yoooo so check it out. If you want to check out a new hip and happening place without breaking the bank then Cafe Sanuki is the place to be.  So this is a cafe style eatery, just like when we went to school. You would go grab a tray and pick up whatever food you wanted. This place does specialize in udon with homemade noodles so I do recommend you get at least one bowl among the other things.  Now I'm not going to lie to you. The udon is definitely not the best but it is for sure better than most. I don't even like udon but this place keeps me coming back for more. The staff here is super friendly and will help you out with whatever you need.  Now for the best bit...my review of some of the food there: Niku Udon - This is a basic hot udon with beef and onions and broth. This does have the option to add an egg to it which I do like for a small fee. This is a great udon to have if you aren't feeling adventurous as you can't really go wrong with this one. Kamaage Udon - This is a cool dip udon that comes in a bucket, and before you ask (when you see the display case at the restaurant) the udon does come in that giant bucket that you see. This is probably one of the bigger servings of udon offered by this place which is something that I enjoy. Basically you get a bucket of udon with broth on the side and you take udon from the bucket and put in the broth and eat it from the little bowl of broth. This helps keep the natural flavor of the udon without diluting it with broth which I thoroughly enjoyed. Curry Udon - If you like udon and you like Japanese curry, then you get the best of both worlds in this dish. Nuff said. Although I do have to mention the one time I did get this dish I found it a little watery, probably from the udon water but this was still good. Not spicy at all so if you can't handle spice but want to eat curry, you can jump on this dish. Beef Rice - Basically the same toppings you would get on the Niku Udon but on rice. I enjoyed this bowl more than I did with the udon only because I think the flavors work better with rice but that's just my opinion. Variety Tempura - The tempura here is just your basic tempura. A must grab for sure. They do have a tempura sauce station next to the drink station so don't forget to get some dipping sauce for these delectable morsels. I do suggest getting the fish cake tempura though (the one that looks like a tube of blisters). It doesn't look that great but tastes amazing. I haven't seen any other places with this kind of fish cake so this is definitely a must try if you haven't tasted it yet. Variety Onigiri - This place has a bunch of onigiri which is cool to get if you want to feel like you're eating a cute bento in Japan. They have a bunch of fillings. The one that I do not recommend is the spam one. I grabbed one on accident and it is just a not good masubi. Mentai is my favorite onigiri which is a slightly spicy cod fish filling. This one has the most flavor out of the ones that I have eaten. Taiyaki - This is basically a cake in the shape of a fish that has red bean paste. This is a dessert so be sure to enjoy this at the end of your meal. This is what all the kids in those animes you watch eat so get this to submerge yourself in the otaku culture. It is pretty tasty but does not compare to the real thing so don't get your hopes up that high. KARAAGE - No the caps were not a mistake. I wanted to use that to grab your attention because I think this is one of the best items they have at this place. If you do not know what karaage is, it is basically just deep fried chicken. However they cook it makes this chicken so dang juicy. I have had a lot of karaage in the past and this is one of the best. It is extremely flavorful as well. Try to get the hot ones when they come out of the kitchen if you can as those are the best ones but even the ones that are sitting under the heating light are pretty bomb as well. I get these every time I come here. Oden - At the end of the line you have the option of getting some fish hot pot. I do enjoy this a lot and I do not enjoy normal hot pot. This is just a nice compliment to your meal especially on a cold winter's day and you just need some soup to warm up your soul.  For my final tips, be sure to check the times that this place is open. This place does have a break between 3pm and 5pm. Also you do get a free drink for checking in on yelp so might as well take advantage of that offer while it is still available ;) Other than that just enjoy yourself in this awesome atmosphere.  Happy Eating!",

The fried foods available a la carte consisted of tempura style squash, shrimp. I got the squash and it was very greasy and warm at best probably was sitting there for a while. I also ordered the pork Katsu with curry and rice. It was okay. Nothing special I didn't even finish it. We also got udon noodle soup it was just okay Luke warm. If you check in on yelp you get a free drink. They have sodas and teas and calpico.   Service wise the food came out quickly. They were not that busy.

    "text": "We were craving a lighter lunch and decided to venture off-strip to Chinatown.  Yelp reviews of Cafe Sanuki were outstanding, and yes Udon sounded great.  A few months ago, we had an exceptional Udon experience at Ippinn Udon in Santa Rosa, CA.  Ippinn's owner graduated from an Udon College in Japan, so we had high expectations coming into Sanuki in Vegas.   Overall I would say Sanuki excels in their tempura (squid, fish cake, shrimp, and sweet potato all good) and some of their onigiri (kombu being excellent while salmon was dry and bland).  Their Udon however we found just average.  Broth was a bit too salty for us while the noodles were softer and soggier than we liked.  Beef was flavored well on both the #2 and #3 Udon.  The #2 had what looked like a lightly poached/borderline raw egg in it FYI.  Service was friendly but note this is mostly a self-serve and self-cleanup establishment.  A  bit surprising since the restaurant is pretty good sized and it can be awkward  for customers to carry two heavy, piping hot Udon Bowls along some narrow aisles to get to your seat.  Overall a 3 star for me.  Decent Tempura and Onigiri but Udon was average for us.",

    "text": "This is a low-key cafeteria style place that specializes in many varieties of udon. You grab a tray, place your order, maybe pick up a few more grab-and-go items, check out, sit down, and your made-to-order items are brought out to you.   I got the Nabeyaki Udon. Flavor of the broth was good, but definitely needed some spice added (jars are sitting at the drink station for you to add flavor to your desire). My biggest complaints about the udon are 1) noodles were only a good texture for the first minute and then got really mushy!, 2) two out of four people who ate there got really sick after. Not sure if there's a ton of garlic or MSG in the broth, but we were both sick within an hour of eating. I had only eaten half my bowl of udon, and didn't drink any broth. So I'm surprised I ate enough to be sick.   The restaurant isn't the cleanest. Many tables were open, and no one was cleaning them on any apparently regular schedule. Out of 10 open tables, maybe 3 appeared to be clean.   Servers were nice, but not very engaged or helpful considering this is a restaurant concept that is going to be new to a lot of people.  I grabbed a fish cake tempura and 2 shrimp tempura from the grab-and-go section. All of those items were cold, and the tempura batter wasn't very great. It tasted like the items had been cooked hours earlier.   Drink station was nice - tons of drink options, tea options, flavor syrups to add. But could have been more cleaned up.   Someone got the clam udon and they had a TON of clams on it. Probably a good value item, but I didn't taste it myself.   I would maaaaybe go back if I needed a really quick bite for under $10, but I'm not extremely likely to return.",

It's tucked away from \"ChinaTown\" but not too far on the Decatur side of Spring \"Foodie\" Mt. The place is always clean, has ample seating and parking (a plus in new foodie Vegas, and has a great free Refills drink Area with some of the Best Lemonade in town  (in my opinion)   You come in to a cool display of the food they serve encased in a glass mural in the front. You the grab a tray and pick by number or name the meals or entree you want. They give you a ticket and you can move to the appetizers size, or go to register and get your drink and pay. You get a beeper, that buzz when your order is ready, and you sit and enjoy!   What more can you ask for ?   I have never had a bad meal or a bad experience. Is it the best nope, is it the most popular, nope, is it the most consistent delicious food in town, for me yupper !   Get your noodle on man !",

Along with the GREAT soup, we also had a great experince:   Staff were all very friendly and welcoming.  The restaurant is clean, you can feel it.   Ambience is good. Music is not too loud.   Drinks are tasty! Don't forget to try the Calpico!   I'll take all my favorite people here. It's worth the drive!   Thanks Cafe Sanuki for giving me one more reason to live in Las Vegas. Haha!",

The first time we came back, we discovered their new menu items such as takoyaki (octopus balls), cheesy carbonara etc.  We ordered our favourites: #23 katsu curry (curry breaded pork chop) rice and #29 chicken salad udon with miso dressing for both times.  We also tried out #14 cheesy carbonara and #7 shoyu pork.  The first two remained our favourites since the pork chop was thick and juicy with a nice crunch.  Salad udon was super refreshing for hot summer days with big portion of chicken and veggies.  Udon had the right chewy texture (unlike #7 was a bit too soft).  Cheesy carbonara was a kid's favourite.  Shoyu pork was our least favourite since the udon was a bit too soft.  We will definitely come back again to try out other new menu items.  Always like their free drink with Yelp check-ins and their super friendly staff.",

Upon entering, there's a trophy case of fake food representing the items that can be ordered, which I think is very helpful and a unique way to present the menu. It reminds me of a little cafeteria, having to grab a tray and order food. Cafe Sanuki mainly serves a variety udon soup and rice bowls. So far, my favorite is number 7- the Shoyu Pork Udon Soup. It has pork belly and egg. The broth is just enough sweet and salty.  The service is always amazing. There was only one time when it took half an hour to receive the rest of my order, but the employees were very apologetic and comped our food.",

I'll be honest, Las Vegas was the last place I'd expect to see high quality Japanese food, and I'm really glad my girlfriend and I decided to make the drive off the strip to come by here.  Food: You start by getting the broth of udon you want (or you can get pasta), and then you go around to the other side of the food station and pick up whatever street food you want. I opted for two sticks of the chicken karaage (which was the perfect amount of seasoning and breading) and 3 pieces of takoyaki. Super tasty!  Service: Service was good too. Most, if not all, of the workers were young and friendly. Nobody gave us an issue or a side-eye.  Everything was great and if we're ever in Vegas again, we'll be sure to stop by here to hit that udon craving!",

There are also some appetizer/side-dish-esque foods available prior to paying at the cashier.  Some of the more involved udon dishes are made to order and then brought out to you at your table. There are plenty of udon dishes to choose from, and even some non-noodle offerings.  I really enjoyed the Calpico-lemonade concoction beverage as well. Service is good.

    "text": "Came here on a Monday during lunch and it was pretty quiet.  The set up was very cute.  When you first walk in, there's a big display of their available dishes in plastic, and it's vibrant in colours.  Their ordering system is a little confusing.  They have these take out booklets right when you walk in, and it's very helpful as each dish is explained with what broth is used, and what ingredients are inside.  Once you walk in, you order with someone in the kitchen with an ipad.  This is NOT where you pay, this is to put in your order into the kitchen so they could start making your food.  The tempura, onigiri, takoyaki and other small snacks are on the side where you can pick up your own onto a dish.   At the end of that line, then the cashier is there.  You will hand over the receipt (for your kitchen order), and they will charge you for your snacks, then you wait at your table for the rest of your food to be brought to you.  The tempura is very fresh, lightly battered, and crispy.  Usually when they are pre-fried, they're soggy and stale, but because they only do like 3-4 tempura at a time, it keeps them fresh!  We got the fish cake tempura, squid tempura, chicken karage, takoyaki and mentai onigiri.  The tempura were really good, although a little on the pricey side, averaging about 1.50-1.75 a piece.  The chicken karage was really worth it.  At 1.75, and had 3 big pieces!  Nicely seasoned. The Takoyaki were light and fluffy, and with a nice piece of octopus inside.  The mayo, sauce and bonito flakes really go well together.  The most disappointing was the onigiri.  Maybe the person who wrapped it made it too tight, but I couldn't slide the paper out, when I pulled, out came the rice and broke the onigiri in half.  I had to break the plastic wrapping to rescue the rice, then re-stuff it back into the seaweed.  But even after that, the onigiri was just very plain.    We got the nabeyaki Udon, came in a big bowl, as I shared this with my husband.  Has a nice runny egg, some beef, a shrimp tempura, some tempura flakes, mushrooms, spring onions.  The broth was very nicely balanced and not too salty.  The sweetness of the beef can be tasted in the soup, and balanced it out very well.  The udon was nice and chewy and had a bounce to it.  Very nice bowl of noodles.  Lastly we went back and bought a pork belly bao.  I saw others order it, and it looked very good.  I really enjoyed this as the bao was very fluffy and soft.  There's 2 pieces of pork belly in the middle, and some slaw with sauce.  Was very good with each bite, the bao soaked up all the sauce!  Don't forget to check into yelp to get a free drink!  They have Calpis, tea, regular soda and a lemonade Calpis!  It was unique and different from other drink stations!!!",

    "text": "NOTE: Check in and get a free beverage!   Came here with my sister and my mom yesterday for lunch to see what's so special about this place. Upon walking in I was a bit confused on how to order, but it's actually real simple. As I was waiting I was just admiring the models of the food as it is basically the whole menu. As for ordering It's like a cafeteria and you pick up a tray and go to the counter to order. As your order is being prepared you get to select from a good variety of appetizers, after that you go and pay and I showed them my check in for a free beverage and they highly recommended the lemonade. To me the lemonade wasn't anything special and tasted like any ordinary lemonade I could get at grocery store, however the calpico was a really good drink.  We ordered the Yaki Udon, curry rice with chicken Katsu, nabeyaki udon and the miso garlic pork belly as our main dishes. For the appetizers we ordered two orders of shrimp tempura, two orders of chicken karaage  two orders of egg tempura, an order of white fish tempura, and an order of fish cake tempura. Sadly all of our main dishes literally had no flavor, but the staff and service was nice and attentive. Plus, the place is very clean and the decor is very nice and the place is very spacious. Out of all the food we ordered, the egg tempura and the chicken karaage had flavor and were my favorite. Not sure if we came on the wrong day/time and the cooks forgot to put any sort of flavor into our main dishes, but if that can be corrected then I can see this place succeed even more.",

The staff is super friendly and is happy to help you order. It's an order and pay at the counter before you get your food kind of restaurant. We ordered the mini curry rice bowl, mini pork belly rice bowl, pork belly bao, nabeyaki udon and the yaki udon. Everything was so good, full of flavor and so fresh! For sure though they do have large portions! So if you're not too hungry, I would definitely share!! But I find it never a problem to take left overs home!   The restaurant is pretty open and good size place. There's counter space as well by the windows. There's good music and good vibes! I for sure will be back...over and over again! If you love udon as much as I do you'll love this spot! A plus is for those who love picture menus, they also have a display of the food as well, when you walk into the restaurant! Actually reminds me of Japan town in LA! I love it!",

I got the curry udon, and it was ok. It wasn't the best udon I've ever had, nor was it the worst. Marukame udon in Waikiki really set the bar for me. Not sure if they hand-make the noodles here, but the udon noodles tasted like they were pre-packaged. I actually like the packaged udon noodles that they sell in the Asian markets so I'm not complaining. The tempura, however, was cold! No bueno!  Not many choices for udon here in Vegas. It's either Monzo or here. If you want something quick, Cafe Sanuki wouldn't be a bad choice.",

I really wanted the ontama bukake udon but they were out of eggs or didn't have any that day I tried. Broth wasn't too salty and it was good! I might've had too much expectations as I've had udon in Hawaii and I dearly crave it! But this is pretty good. I can't compare it to Hawaii because we don't have anything close to it.   I got a mini beef bowl. (Dangit, I wasn't thinking, I should've tried curry bowl instead of beef bowl with a beef udon ha!) yeahhhh it kinda tasted the same as my udon... But my bad! Still not bad tho! I had a bite of my SO's curry bowl and that wasn't too bad either however, I don't always have curry cravings.  The last items i got was the sweet potato tempura and aspargus. I got the asparagus fresh! it was huge! yum yum! I enjoyed this udon place. I will probably come back to try the different types that they offer. Hopefully can get me some of the stuff with eggs!",

    "text": "Came here this past Sunday with my husband and Andrew C. We would've went earlier but worked all week so Sunday was my only day off. We all got invited to their Pre-Opening event, which means they were generous enough to gift us with a meal. We have been waiting for Sanuki to open ever since August and boy has it been a long wait. We booked our reservation for 1200PM - 100PM.   We got there a little bit after 1200PM and there was a line out the door. According to the associate, it was going to be a half an hour wait, which we already anticipated. One of our friends was there earlier for his 1100AM reservation and he said the kitchen was backed up. The kitchen couldn't keep up with the volume but that's also to be expected. They are in their pre-opening so they're all trying to get the hang of working in an extremely busy establishment.   I love the layout of the restaurant. It reminds me of the udon places that I've visited in Japan and Hawaii. It's slightly different than your usual American restaurant. It runs on a cafeteria system. You grab a tray, tell them what kind of udon you want, they give that to you, then you move along to the area where all the tempura is at. You get to put whatever you want on your plate and in the end, you get rung up based on what you have on your tray. So it isn't table service so please don't complain that you had to stand and get your own food.   As an invited guest, we were allowed one udon, one mini rice, and two tempura items. With the Yelp check in offer, we also got a free drink. Unfortunately, because we came at the later end of their pre-opening, we missed some opportunities. One of our yelp friends got to order whatever he wanted when he went on their first pre-opening date. But that is fine. I'm not a huge eater -- one bowl is enough. It just sucks when things are not consistent through the same event.  We probably chose the wrong date to go regardless because they did not have the clam udon that day, which was my first choice. Not only that but by the time we were able to order, they had ran out of egg. The eggs they used are imported from Japan so they are much cleaner and safer to eat when the yolk is raw. It's understandable that they ran out but laaaaaaame, my second choice was now out the door. I ended up going with the kitsune udon, which is sweet deep fried tofu with udon. For my mini bowl, I went with the miso garlic pork belly. As for my tempura choices, I went with the sweet potato and shrimp tempura. I also grabbed a mentai (spicy cod roe) onigiri.   For their drinks, they have a drink station, which is pretty awesome. You get to choose between their signature lemonade, ice teas, or create your own drink in their coke machine. I ended choosing their lemonade and I'm glad I did. Their lemonade was not super diabetic sweet. It was light and a little tangy. I definitely recommend getting that.   Their udon is okay -- it was a little more overcooked than I would've liked. I prefer a firmer texture to my udon and it is quite disappointing that Sanuki did not reach that level of firmness. Perhaps it was too busy and it messed up their mojo but one of my friends that went on Saturday said he had the same issue with the firmness. Also, their soup base was luke warm by the time I actually ate it. I don't know if their broth just isn't hot enough or they just took way too long with my order. I like my soup steaming, please.  I also got to try my friend's mentai cream udon. It was fantastic. You can tell that they use super fresh ingredients because it's not fishy at all. I've had the mentai udon at Monzo and it wasn't as good and I've had a mentai cream spaghetti at another place but it was fishy. Good job, Sanuki. Let's hope you keep that freshness level up.   The tempura is decent as well. I just wished they had yam tempura or maybe an egg tempura. But who knows, maybe they had it and ran out. They do not refill the onigiris if they run out because they don't want to waste anything by over-making. They also like to keep things really fresh. As for the pork belly bowl -- I really wished that they cut the pork belly into pieces instead of giving me strips. I was only so-so on it. I did not even finish this but it's partially because I was too full.   Their prices are fantastic. Out of all the udon establishments that we have in Vegas, Sanuki is probably the cheapest. Plus during their pre-opening event, you get 30% off everything!  Overall, I would definitely be back. But if they can stop overcooking their udon and give me steaming/piping hot broth then they'd be perfect (almost) all around.",

But the food is terrific, as good as you will get at the pricier noodle restaurants in town but at a much cheaper price. I had the mitai udon, savory and perfectly prepared. I also got a few tempura items and a curry, which I ended up taking home. All for a bit over $16.  I will certainly be back. And probably more than once.",

    "text": "After reading all the good reviews, I had this place bookmarked for a few months. I finally got the chance to visit it last night, and I can say from my first experience, that this is probably one of my favorite spots in Las Vegas.  When I walked in, the first thing that I noticed was the decor. I have not personally been to Japan, but my friend who has says that it looks authentic. There is a ceramic display case of their food options at the entrance and the interior is almost entirely wood. Japanese culture is littered around the dining room, such as mangas and other cute items. If you enjoy Japanese or cute interiors, this place has one the best in the city.  Even the way that the food is served is pretty unique. It almost mimics a cafeteria line. You grab a tray and have the option to select side orders, or order an entree. If getting an entree you will receive a buzzer to notify you when the food is ready.  Finally, the food. In addition to udon, they have a good selection of tempura, rice dishes, onigiri, etc. This is one of those restaurants where you have to take a picture of your food just because of how pretty the presentation is. I ordered the Nabeyaki udon, curry katsu, and the braised pork over rice. My friend had the carbonara udon. The portion sizes of the entrees here are pretty huge despite the price. The braised pork was extremely tender and was borderline liquid in the mouth. The katsu was crispy, and actually had appropriate portions of rice. The curry taste, in my opinion, is comparable to even Zen Curry. The udon was HUGE. Like it came in a pot lmao. It had so many flavors packed in, mushrooms, shrimp tempura, green onion, beef, etc. I loved all the dishes I got.  All in all, I would recommend this place. Great portion sizes, good taste, cute interior, and friendly staff. Can't wait to visit again.",

    "text": "UPDATE: MUST TRY THEIR KATSU CURRY! The Katsu curry was so good. Crunch and filling. Portion size was perfect.  Walking into the place definitely gives you a wow impression. They have this huge glass case that presents their dishes and portion sizes. The atmosphere was spacious and calm. It was almost a full house. However it didn't sound noisy as I thought it would be. When you order you stand in line and they give you a pager. You have the option to grab some tempura before paying. When we went, there was not much left. There weren't any rice rolls either, which was something I was looking forward to try as well.   My boyfriend and I ordered, Seafood Tomato Cream Udon, Nabeyaki and Pork Belly Bao.  After ordering my boyfriend and I found a seat. We waited for the pager to buzz. 1st time it did, it was JUST my seafood dish that had been given. Lady at the register told me to keep the pager for our next order. Second order was delivered by them. Then a few minutes later, the pager buzzed. It was the Pork Belly Bao. The deliver of service was a bit confusing and all over the place.. I didn't really like the idea of walking across the room to grab my order one by one. Usually places that have pagers, your food is given to you all at once. Don't get me wrong, the staff was friendly and nice. Just the coordination was a little off.  Going into the food, the quality of the Udon was perfect. It wasn't over cooked. It was chewy. Which I enjoyed. Although, my dish wasn't the greatest. Would I order it again? No. It tasted like the tomato sauce I would get at the store. The seafood wasn't fresh for sure (not that im saying they said it was). I serve at a seafood restaurant that serves fresh seafood, so it was easy to distinguish. My boyfriend got the Nabeyaki and he wasn't that fond of it either. Didn't stick out from the other places we had udon with. The broth didn't stand out to be exact.  Third, the pork belly bao was definitely something we decided we'd order again. It was full of flavor. The bun was PERFECTION! I would come back for it.",

    "text": "I kept seeing ads for this place so my husband and I decided to check it out. We were a little disappointed, I'm giving it a 2 star because we did eat our food, only because we try not to waste. Although I read on a sign by the cafeteria style line that if you are not happy with your food, they'll gladly exchange it, but we just didn't want the bother so we finished it. Anyway, we liked the prices but a tall young guy with a heavy accent took our order and he wasn't very friendly. First of all, we had to repeat our order 3x because he was confused when we said, \" 1 pork belly bowl, 1 miso pork belly bowl, and 1 pork belly bao\", he thought we wanted 2 baos and when we clarified, he said to us, \"well you're saying it wrong then\".. umm huh?? So we repeated again, and then he realized he was confused between the bowl and bao, we also got mixed vegetable tempura and a skewer of chicken karaage. We are used to Japanese pork belly (buta no kakuni) and even Rafute (okinawan braised pork belly), so although regular pork belly was probably intended in that way it was really dry and tasteless, we suspected maybe they took it out of the braising liquid too long. My husband didn't like his garlic miso pork belly, he also said it was really dry. Also the chicken karaage was no longer crunchy on the outside, it was a little soggy/soft. We ordered the pork belly bao because we just wanted to taste it. We both have tasted so many in different restaurants and my mom always made it. It's typically a chinese/Taiwanese food (Gua bao). We were disappointed because it tasted like they used one of the same pork belly we just had in our rice bowls, which were both dry and didn't taste that good. They need to kick up the slaw and sauce they put in their bao, it's bland. We love the crispy veggie tempura, and that's about all we liked from our food that day. If we ever go back, maybe we can try their udon. We grew up in Hawaii where Japanese food is normal for us. Although some of their food is Japanese, some of their food do not have the typical Japanese taste, more like Chinese and not even good chinese food at that. Had to be honest here.",

They both ordered the same item as me, and guess what, they got their food before me. I was pissed, and I went to ask but the cashier was nice enough to give us some food while we were waiting. That cooled me down a bit, but I waited for another 5-10 minutes and it still hadn't come. At the end, it came and I barely had 5 minutes to eat. The next visit, I arrived and ordered a different item. The food staff (here it is) told me to wait while they would \"quickly\" prepare it. I stood there, a few customers had ordered and left to sit. There I was. Standing. Waiting. Then, one lady with a white apron stood there slowly looking around...not even starting my order. Finally, one other guy started it and got it to me. That lady in the white apron...honestly...",

I had the Clam udon,the Niku udon,braised pork belly rice, and the pork belly bao. Nice spot that I would definitely continue going for a simple quick meal",

Fresh food is prepped for the day- they do not own a freezer, just refrigerators.    Udon noodles are dense and chewy as should be.   Nice menu selection.   Prices are good too.   Once the ordering system is understood, it's a very efficient fast, organized process.    Calpico and lemonade yummy.    Customer service is excellent - ultra friendly, fast and accommodating.",

Despite being cafe style dining the staff and owner are enthused to serve you. They stopped by a couple times while i was eating just to make sure everything was perfect. It is the best udon i have ever had despite being the cheapest. (not counting ones you make yourself) i just wish they were open later so i could stop by after my late classes. I will be coming back soon and often!",

I got the nabiaki n the kids got the kake udon and various tempura pieces. They were all huge servings and very tasty! There was a mistake so it caused an issue receiving our food in a timely manner, but the owner graciously apologized n kindly compensated us. His customer service skills are stellar n the food is definitely worth coming back again.  Cheers to our new fave noodle house in Vegas!",

I had the a Yaki udon and it was delicious, nothing was overcooked, just the right amount of ingredients, and smelled so goooood. I will definitely be back and will definitely tell my friends and colleagues about this wonderful place.",

The staff was sincere, knowledgeable, friendly... I love the diversity of their staff!  -food was really good!!! I want to try everything else they have to offer!!! So far everything we tried was good... although the beef bowl was so so, but still good.. I love love love the tempura soft boiled egg, the tempura fish cake, shrimp... you can buy them per piece, I love love love how they have a refillable calpico drink station, and I Love their Sanuki lemonade which is like a mix between calpico and lemonade. My kid, who is usually a very picky eater, truly enjoyed her food and she ate a lot!  -I love the ambience, and how they have replicas of their dishes for us to ogle at. They use real plates, their to go containers are really eco friendly, it looks like you actually went to Japan. -I love the price!!! For a group of 3 adults and 2 kids, with all of us being super full,I paid around $45, not bad at all! Very reasonably priced!!   Conclusion, I am definitely recommending this place, I will definitely come back! Although I have to warn you, after eating, you will have an unusual craving for those fishy shaped desserts filled with chocolate and unfortunately their machine is broken and I am patiently anticipating its arrival from Japan!",

The only other place you can compare Cafe Sanuki is Japanese udon restaurants in Hawaii. In Hawaii people would hours for a fresh bowl of Udon.  Like in Hawaii, Cafe Sanuki has freshly made udon, tofu, eggs, and tempura.  Everything in Cafe Sanuki is fresh!  There is a very cool cafeteria concept and you can just peak in and see how everything is made because the kitchen is an open kitchen.  They are very clean.  I had ordered the boil egg with udon.  The boil egg is to die for in the udon!  The egg yolk is nice and soft like where you would have in Japan.  The fried chicken sewers were also sooo good and fresh! Everything in this restaurant was so good.  The lemonade is different than any other lemonade.  If you are there make sure you try the lemonade.  I love everything about this restaurant, the decor, the staff, the food.  I wish there were more restaurants like this around.  I like it so much, I will be back two more times before I leave Las Vegas.  Mind you, I am only here for 3 days.  I will eat at this place every single time I am back in Vegas.  This is my new favorite restaurant and I am so glad my friend took me here to eat.  I am in love!!!    This place is must try!",

The udon noodles have great consistency and flavor. The curry udon was pretty good, but the best thing was the pork belly bao.  That was worth the trip alone.  Decent place for a quick lunch... there may be better udon places, but this one serves up decent food with a load of convenience.",

    "text": "I arrived around 12:30 pm and to my surprise the place was quite busy.  The cafeteria style line up to order the food was a little slow as there were many people in line.  I was quite impressed with the staff's knowledge of their menu and efficiency especially since they just opened not so long ago. They were all very friendly too. I ordered the seafood tomato cream udon and picked the chicken and fish tempura as my sides.  By the time I got my drink (Free drink if you check in on YELP) and picked a place to sit, my udon was ready.  It came in a huge bowl, so it didn't look like a lot of udon inside.  But to my surprise, I couldn't even finish it all and had leftovers to take home.  The udon was freshly made and tasted so good.  The tempura was equally as tasty.  The menu items are reasonably priced.  I used to have to go out to LA to have some good udon.  I am so glad that they have this type of restaurant in Vegas now.  I definitely will be back to try their other menu items.",

I never thought I'd eat an udon salad but it was awesome and HUGE. Another plus is you can order almost any dish as a mini for around $3.50. So we both got a few items each for around $25 it was a feast. We'll be coming back soon. Also love the manga on the shelves. The interior is fun and light.",

    "text": "Went to Cafe Sanuki friday 6/1 at 1pm.  First time there, so always unsure of how it was going to go.  But here is my overall impression (very detailed review).  When you enter into the restaurant you are greeted by a glass case with the plastic food models.  Very nice feature to help you decide what you want.  However,  several of the models were completely different from what was on the menu.  A #20 in the glass case was chicken with egg rice bowl, while the menu #20 is the pork belly bowl.  This caused us some confusion with picking our items as we were not sure what was correct.  We had been online checking the place out, so thought we had an idea of what was offered.....case threw us off.   So we get in line and as many prior reviews state, it is cafeteria style.  So you grab a tray and slowly slide your way down the line giving your order to one person, while another makes it (this was where our order fell apart), pick some sides if you want (choose from tempura, onigiri or oden), then get rung up at the end by the cashier.  If you happen to get your order immediately after it is made and before you have to pay you then, very carefully, walk your way to one of the many tables (praying you don't spill or slosh any of the precious liquid in your bowl on the way).  Otherwise you get one of those light up, vibrating coaster deals and have to go back up to the main counter when it starts flashing (not exactly convenient), or if you are lucky it will be brought out to you.  As I stated up above, our order went off the rails between telling one person what we wanted and the other person making it.  Unfortunately, the person making the order was not paying attention and we kept having to repeat what we did, or did not want/ordered.  My mom ordered the Kake Udon with no tempura crumbles which they got correct, plus a bottle of the cold bukakke sauce that was not part of her order.  My dad ordered the braised house pork rice bowl with no ginger, and ended up with a huge pile of the pink pickled stuff despite all three of us saying no ginger repeatedly.  I ordered the Ontama Udon.  The person making it kept trying to put ingredients into the bowl that didn't belong.  Almost as if he was making a combination of the Kake, Nabiake and Ontama Udon.  I finally got him to understand that only warm noodles and an onsen tomago were supposed to be in the bowl (then he threw on a bunch of green onion.....I just shook my head).  Then he gave me a miso soup size bowl of broth with more green onions and tempura flakes.  When I said that wasn't the right broth, he insisted it was, and I did not get the plate of grated ginger or green onion (which he also said I did not get, but is what is pictured in the menu and plastic display).  No one else was there who could say otherwise, so I was stuck with that broth and my parents had already been rung up by then and the cashier had stepped away.  Get to our table and start eating.  Turns out that the broth I was given was the same broth as the Kake Udon.  We were checked on by one of the workers (more of a drive by kind of check...almost as if they just expected us to smile and nod, not ask a question), and when we asked if I had the right broth, the worker did not even look and just said, \"yeah that's right,\" then walked away.  What makes this upsetting is that I saw at least three other people order Ontama Udon, and they got the correct broth and ginger/onion plate.  My dad liked his braised pork, the Kake Udon was good but the broth was very fishy, and I can't really say how the Ontama was as they only got it partly right.  I tasted the cold bukakke broth, and that was good.....so if the Ontama would have had the hot bukakke broth and grated ginger/green onions like it was supposed to, it would have been great.  I really wanted to like it, since I love udon and my other go to closed.  But for now it is a meh.  I will give it one more try, since it may have just been poor service.  I hope they get it right this next time.",

We did have to wait a bit for the miso garlic pork belly to come out, but like I said, everything was pretty good, especially for the price. I love that the salmon onigiri and all the onigiri are all grab and go. Definitely recommend the place!",

Atmosphere is pretty nice, lots of tables, nice lighting. There's various books about japan and manga, but I didn't read any since they were all still in their shrink wrap at the time of my visit.   A nice place to at least once, at the very least for a change from all the ramen and sushi.",

    "text": "House made udon served up cafeteria style!  I've tried similar concepts in Honolulu and Seattle and Cafe Sanuki is comparable.  We went for the soft opening and our meal was on the house.  We tried the carbonara udon and the curry udon by default (they ran out of the beef and tofu options). The texture of the noodles was spot on, not mushy like some other places that serve packaged udon.  The carbonara was creamy and flavorful. My 2 year old especially liked this udon.  Nothing special stood out for the curry udon, it's decent curry but not amazing.  I'm glad they did the soft opening so they can work out kinks like running out of certain dishes and organization of order numbers.  I also tried the mini garlic pork belly bowl.  The pork belly is cut thin and was a nice savory flavor with just the right amount of salt for me.  We also tried the tempura shrimp and fish cake.  Definitely try the tempura fish cake, we enjoyed it more than the shrimp surprisingly.  They also have a house made lemonade and Torani syrups to add extra flavor.  Don't forget to check in for a free drink...  The price point is definitely right for the amount of food and this place is great for families with kids. Food was prepared quickly and you seat yourself.  I've been to Monzo Udon and the noodles are right up there in quality, but definitely a more casual approach here.",

Kake is with hot broth, and again, the broth was bland... super tasteless... which was very disappointing cause I wanted to taste the bonito flavor more :(  Curry Udon was just average I mean you can't go wrong with Curry... and Seafood Creamy Tomato Udon was way too garlicky and tasted just like spaghetti sauce lol. Wish they had put a little bit of a twist in it and made it more unique.  Shrimp Tempura was delicious but not Kakiage...  Mini Pork Bowl was also good; Pork was flavored very good however the portion was too small for $3.95 and I think they use cheap rice :(  Oh! Udon noodle was waaaaaay too long lol. They need to cut them in half lol   I understand that it's their first week but the staff need to smile more and be friendly (Christopher at the order counter was the only one that gave excellent customer service btw)  We will revisit one more time in couple of months and see if they improve.",

    "text": "Although several delicious udon places have opened up this year in the Chinatown area (especially Udon Monzo just down the street on Spring Mountain), I was particularly excited for this restaurant to open up with it's interesting cafeteria style concept.  Most of all, I was really excited for the tempura bar!  When you enter the restaurant, you grab a tray and then you place your order from a wide selection of udon or rice bowl dishes.  They make your food upon order.  Once you get your dish, you proceed to this self serving station filled with a myriad of tempura, onigiri, and oden.     I love the decor of the restaurant, which does give an authentic Japanese feel, and the food display they have near the entrance (similar to the ones they have in a lot of the Japanese restaurants in LA) was a nice touch.  All the staff seemed really friendly and polite, despite a little issue we had with one of the cashier.    Unfortunately, our experience with the food was a bit subpar.  I had ordered the kake udon with three different pieces of tempura.  The broth was good, but I wished the temperature was hotter.  It was almost lukewarm.  The udon was completely overcooked as if it had been sitting in water for a while.  It didn't have the fresh, chewy consistency as the other hand-made udon restaurants.  All three of my tempura were cold and slightly staled.  My fiance had ordered the curry rice bowl with katsu pork.  His curry came out completely cold, but the restaurant did kindly fix that for us.  The flavor of the curry was pretty good though once it was served at the correct temperature.  Overall, I think this restaurant has good potential and the prices seem pretty reasonable, so they definitely deserve another chance. But I'll probably wait a bit until they have fixed all the kinks before going back again.",

They have a great selection of different udon to try that are really cheap (~$8-$10)!!! Both my friend and I got clam udon, which was light and tasty. The best part was definitely how fresh and amazing the noodles were!!! I think it was the best udon noodles in Vegas tbh and I would definitely come again to try all the other kinds of broths!!! The soft egg tempura was to die for!! I also got the shrimp and sweet potato tempura which was also really yummy. Definitely a must try place if you love udon at a cheap price.",

What I will really amplify is what others say about the SERVICE here!   It's a diverse group of folks eager to make your experience exceptional. The owner is totally keeping an eye on everything, the pursuit of perfection being fulfilled.  The tempura can really add on to the price, control yourself because it's wonderful.   My only caveat: the udon soups are delicious but not very big. What we had was more a luncheon portion. You can order double noodles but there is no larger offering which would be the size of a typical ramen from what I saw in terms of soup. Next time I will order something more hearty.",

First of all, the cashier/manager/whatever was very very rude when we were ordering. Not to mention the weird ordering system they had where you take a tray, order, and go pay. We ordered 2 different udons, 1 rice, and a pork belly bao - one of our udons came out within a minute and the other we had to wait 10 minutes for! After we ordered all of them together, they gave us a pager for one of our udons and they said it takes longer to cook. We sat and waited for it and when it took too long, we asked them when it would be ready, they said another 5 minutes but it really didn't come out for another 10. It wasn't the waiting that was the problem; The cashier messed up our order and the entire paging thing threw the kitchen off so it was as if we never ordered to begin with. What pissed us off most was that so many people ordered the exact same thing and got theirs within the minute we got our other udon. The cashier/manager obviously knew I was scrolling through yelp when he walked behind me back and forth so he rushed off and got us tempura \"on the house.\" He also told us that they didn't have any more pork belly bao (which we also had been waiting for with the pager - how long does it take to make a dang bao?!) but we saw that other people at other tables were eating it also so we insisted we get a refund. All in all, we had a terrible experience and even though this place just opened up 7 months ago, they really need to work on making sure everything's handled smoothly and that they treat every customer with quality service.",

We came here on a Saturday night, and it has just opened. The plus was that there was no line, and we got our food relatively quick. I am not sure if i'll come again.. I guess if you are a fan of udon, it may be worthwhile checking out.",

The noodles are made fresh every 30 minutes and the food is so fresh they have no walk in freezers. The house lemonade is the best I've ever had. The service is good. The owner, Henry, is dope AF! He asked us about the food and taught me a bit about the udon I was eating. He can easily become the David Chang of Udon noodles. The curry is bad ass as is the tempura selection! I'm definitely coming back here when I'm in Las Vegas.",

I loved the set up of a cafeteria where you order your main entree and then you can add on extra tempura or onigiri.  They also have a Calpico machine!!  I got the nabeyaki, but I thought that it was strange that there was beef in it.  It was very filling and came in the traditional heavy stone pot.  The broth was good and the noodles had a good chew to them.  It was nice to see in line that the noodles were being made fresh.  I'll have to come back for their other dishes.",

It is on the corner of Decatur/Spring Mountain.  4821 Spring Mountain Road Suite G.  It was one of the BEST meals I have ever enjoyed.  This is a UDON restaurant.  I have visited Japan a dozen of times.  Cuisine is tantalizingly delicious!  I had the delectable Carbonara Udon; lucsious Mentai Cream Udon; savory curry rice; plus some amazing Tempura. I give Cafe Sanuki a 5 STARS rating.  I am definitely going back.  They have a unique way of preparing the fresh noodles.  I am jumping backflips.  Thanks to my office neighbor for the special recommendation.  He was RIGHT.  My tastebuds are still tingling.",

He said choose anything from #18-23, but not #22 today since they were out, and so with my udon order I decided to get #18. #18 was a photo of curry rice topped with a kind of katsu meat. Went to order and the kitchen folks said the katsu was pork as they don't have chicken katsu..so OK. I get the pork. Went to pay for my meal and it rung up like $15 (should have been about $12). Cashier told me the additional pork katsu cost $3 on top of the $2.50 and I asked him\" you said it was $2.50 for any choice earlier?\" He was like, \"sorry, the meat is extra, sorry the photo is supposed to be just curry rice..you still want the meat?\" I almost did not want to get the meal but i didn't want to waste any food either so i decided to pay for it but was not happy. As for the curry...it was not good. I have had better. The curry has beef slices in the mix and minimal veggies. I won't be eating the curry dishes again. I will probably come back for just the udon.",

Coming from Minnesota I'm used to any Japanese restaurant being extremely expensive almost always either sushi or hibachi and if it is street food fair or a \"working mans\" Japanese meal like takoyaki , taiyaki, ramen , oden, tempura your still going to be paying a lot for it. I devoured every last bite and next time I'm in Vegas I will be coming back! Plus the staff were extremely kind and helpful! We showed up just as they seemed to be Closing but we weren't treated rudely or rushed at all! Awesome food , price and service you can't go wrong!",

    "text": "Food: It is so rare to find a restaurant that specializes in udon, especially when ramen-culture is so evident in how many ramen houses you will find everywhere.  My mother who has similar taste as me for udon (we normally go out of our way to go to Mifune at Mitsuwa Torrance CA) loved the nabeyaki and so do I.  I am not sure I would say it is the best ever but I do really enjoy it.  I'd recommend going with one of the set udon bowls and only add more toppings (tempura, karaage) to your meal if it is necessary since the a la carte can really add up but the udon bowls by themselves are well priced.  The ambiance is clean, open, and inviting.  This time, I tried the Sanuki lemonade which is like a creamier and yellow Calpico original.  It is yummy and for some reason all of the calorie free diet sodas were not working on the freestyle.  Service here is about 50:50.  Some staff are very friendly and others less so.  I do hope this place continues to do well because udon needs to get more lime-light so that we can enjoy this hot and 'soul-food' so to speak noodle soup.  In my opinion, udon is meant to be leisurely enjoyed rather than quickly engulfed like ramen making it a truly enjoyable food.  I also like that the broth tends to be less oily and the noodles more hearty.",

    "text": "\"modern cafeteria concept of traditional Japanese noodle shops\"..sounds great on their business card, tastes great when you eat there..  Sanuki Service:  Upbeat friendliness was experienced at every point of contact.  Everyone behind the counter was eager to help you with any questions and the cashier was so friendly.  The crew was quick to clear the table of finished bowls and trays when you were done.  Great positive vibe here, sweet.  Sanuki cuisine: The Carbonara Udon is my #1 here. This is a dish that can go so wrong if the cream and noodles aren't quality, they do it right at Sanuki! The noodles are prepped well and was evident in all the noodle dishes I've sampled.  I added the extra braised house pork belly (because I'm extra) as a mini rice bowl option and I'm glad I did, tasty.   The Curry chicken with rice is flavorful non-udon option. Also, over sized bowls are used to serve the main dishes.  I'm not sure if it has a functional purpose, but it's great for social media posts!  Sanuki Ambiance:  I'm such a fan of the operational  design efficiencies!  1) Immediately upon entry is a glass display case showcasing the popular dishes = gets patrons ready to order once in line  2) Menu on the monitors = Clear display of food options and easy to update on the fly  3) Dedicated FTE/staff to take orders which: notifies kitchen staff and is uploaded to POS (point of sale) system for the cashier.  Most of the staff is in the kitchen getting the orders ready quickly and keeping the quality in check. 4) Self Service Drinks = Keeps staff focused on the food and service in the dining area (clearing tables).  Also that Calpico dispenser is awesome, I started tearing up when I saw it. lol  The huge open dining area is attractively decorated with a Japanese Udon house style with wood everywhere.  There's a long bar for single diners and tables that accommodate parties of 6 and 4. The tables are mobile and can be moved to accommodate even larger parties.  Overall this place is such a win.  The quality of food, service for the price point is incredibly tough to beat.  I'll be back to check out more dishes and get my AYCD Calpico in, but that's another Yelp tale.  Enjoy!",

The dipping sauce was a little too salty. I also tried my friend's nabeyaki udon. I liked the broth, but the noodles were still missing the right consistency.  The restaurant was mostly filled when we got there, but wait was not too bad for late lunch on a Saturday. I thought prices were reasonable. Overall very average experience, so probably won't return next time I'm in Vegas.",

If not, you'll go sit down with a number and the food will be brought out to you.  It wasn't too busy when we came in.    We've been searching for a substitute for Udon Monzo closing down.  This is the closest I would say so far.  But still not as good as Monzo.  We ordered some pork belly steam buns, it was huge!  We didn't think it was that big in size.  We did order two cold udon dishes and katsu curry dish.  For two people, it's a lot of food!  Good thing we got our food out before our last friend showed up to order.  She shared it with us.  Oh, I was excited for their lemonade since I haven't had it for a while, sadly it was super bitter.  I don't know if this is the normal for them or not.  I'll have to it again next time we're in.   Overall the food and service was good.  Noodles are better than some places in town.  We would come back.",

You walk in and there's this giant visual  display of their dishes, encased in glass. Very helpful I might add! It's actually quite stunning! We were waiting for a mintue to see if we would be approached but then realized we were supposed to walk up to the counter to order. Hint! Walk towards the right and they will greet you and help you out! We were greeted by several people behind the counter. All very friendly. I mentioned that it was our first time there and they made a thing about it to the other workers and they all said hello in their own way. The menu is very descriptive, with pictures (also helpful). The despcriptions of the food made them all the more enticing. There were also alacarte items, such as tempura vegetables and some other items I wasn't too familiar with. We both had tempura asparagus and pumpkin. The tempura is under a heat lamp and already precooked. (I would have preferred is fresh but it was still tasty) We ordered the Nabaki Udon and the Yaki Udon. To me The Nabaki Udon has a shrimp flavored broth. It has alot of different textures and flavors going on and I think I preferred that over the Yaki Udon. The Yaki Udon has pork belly and cabbage and it came in this gigantic bowl!!! Make sure to come with an appetite!! There's chopsticks, forks and spoons available in a side station for anyone and self serve beverages.   The fresh lemonade is amazing by the way!!! The decor is really nice and clean and they have little Bhuddas and Anime book collections and other fun stuff. I really liked it in there. The staff is amazing and should not go left unnoticed. One of them came by our table and asked how everything was. She explained that the udon is all made fresh daily in an old school machine. The noodles seem to go for miles!!! Lol Overall, great experience!  We will return!",

You order what you want at the counter and they will bring it out to you. One thing I noticed was that the workers were very attentive and nice when I was ordering!   There are a lot of choice of things to get here. I personally got to try the nabiaki udon, mentai cream, beef rice, pork belly bao and a couple of rice rolls. The amount of food you get for the price is great. They give you a lot of food and it tastes pretty good.   The nabiaki is a good way to get a variety of items in your bowl.   The mentai cream was pretty delicious, different from the soup style that udon usually comes with.   The beef rice bowl was good, but nothing too special. It was just like any gyudon I have had in the past.   The pork belly bao was pretty good. I really like how the pork belly was seasoned.   The rice rolls were just OK. The fillings were good, but the rice itself was plain. I wished the rice had some additional taste to it.   If you want good, affordable, nice serving sized foods, this is definitely a place to check out!",

But there's something off about their quality and texture of their udon -- it's a bit mushier. I'll push it up to 4 stars because it's nice to have a Japanese udon spot like this as an option in Vegas when the craving hits. Open area and plenty of room for seating.",

I like this style of ordering because it makes the service even faster, but a downside is it could be annoying to stand in line during peak hours. We came in with a group of 10 around 2PM on a Sunday and there was no wait!  I ordered the Mentai Creamy Udon and sweet potato tempura on the side. Although I didn't love it as much as Marugame, the udon was yummy and great quality! The tempura was good, and the lemonade/calpico soda fountains were on point (we checked-in on Yelp for a free drink). The prices were also reasonable.  The service was great! As soon as we came in, someone met us at the front to explain how we should order. Most of us got our food right away but for the dishes that took longer to cook, they brought it out to our table. Very nice staff!   Overall great food & service, would recommend!",

FOOD Ontama Udon: This was my first time having a chilled udon bowl and it was absolutely delicious. Smooth udon noodles in a flavorful broth and topped with a poached egg, this was perfection.   Beverages: Their beverage machine was one of the highlights of my visit. There's so many different flavors. Peach Sprite Zero is a dream come True.  Tempura: Slim selections. There was hardly any tempura left when I visited, except for some squash and squid. My squash tempura was unfortunately cold. It didn't look like the trays were going to be refilled anytime soon as the restaurant closes at 3:00pm to prepare for dinner.   I wanted to finish up my meal and experience at Cafe Sanuki with a taiyaki, but I was told that the \"machine broke down.\"   SERVICE Speediness isn't the cafe's forte and I was unimpressed with the ordering experience. It's frustrating having to repeat your order several times, wait for some of the people behind the counter to stop chatting and complete your order so you can move on. Aside from all that, customer service was generally fine.   \"PRO TIP\" If you're deciding to eat here, I'd suggest coming in as early as possible if you want freshly made side items like onigiri and tempura.",

I loved that the steak teriyaki came with a little side salad that tasted just as good mixed in with everything else. The steak itself was always tender and cut up into small pieces which were easy to eat and delicious. The rice was always perfectly cooked. Whatever sauces they put on the steak is simply delectable.",

    "text": "Delicious & affordable comfort carbs!   At Cafe Sanuki, there is a wealth of varieties that you can find here with udon being their main focus (served both warm and cold). Venue-wise, it was located a small plaza in Spring Mountain, with plenty of parking. We came here on a weekend afternoon and there was a modest line to order our food, but the interior was quite pleasant, it's clean and homey.   For lunch, I ventured for their carbonara Udon. First of all, presentation was absolutely enticing. Plated immaculately served in a giant bowl along with a giant ladle. Needless to say, the portion was humongous. Taste-wise, I thought it was satisfactory - there was a good balance of creaminess and saltiness. The noodle texture, however, could be better, mine was a little over-cooked.   Having our belly full with udon, we can't resists ordering their Beef Bowl Gyudon as well (it just looks so darn good). Perfectly sweet marinated beef and onion on a bed of rice; very filling and delicious  We also had the shrimp tempura and karaage on the side, which was just okay. I had zero complaint for the shrimp, it was sweet, fresh and perfectly crisp. The chicken karaage, on the other hand, was quite stale. Not a big fan.   The service was friendly and I absolutely love the cafeteria concept - where you ordered at the counter, given a number, get your own utensils, condiments, food and drinks. Pricing was very affordable considering the BIG portions and good quality. In short, if you're in the area and curiously starving for udon with an interesting twist. This is a spot worth trying.",

Where now noodles shops are everywhere in Vegas. Cafe Sanuki personality does make it stand alone from the rest. More cafeteria style concept go around Ushape open kitchen. Not only do u get see make fresh udon noodles. All the magic in the kitchen as bonus.   Throwback part.....Rod will appreciate it?! Shirokiya days all over again. They would have all traditional Japanese style dishes can order fresh (couple different hot stations go to) to order, some done grab whatever ur fancy, or the best ones all (lot of choices bento box) pack meals. The glass display with Japanese decor, pictures, and display of the food. I loved the concept soon as I walked in.  The food I know should gone for the udon. I was more in Katsu Curry Mood. It was good. The Japanese style curry was so on point. The katsu it could have been better. The chicken felt meat was little dry. The breading was great. Once u add the \"Da bomb\" curry action all good. I got order of the pork belly bao. Not fan. The cabbage slaw combine with the pork belly never worked. It overpowered the pork belly and slaw itself nothing special or stood outlet. The portion size on both dishes were great! Prices are very affordable.   The staff was five stars from everyone interacted with all smiles, friendly, and great!!!",

    "text": "Q:  Why did the Udon noodles stop drinking? A:  They wanted to be Soba!  Ever since my favorite udon place closed down in Las Vegas, I've been heartbroken! It's been a year since I've had some uni udon and I needed some udon! Sure, we had ramen already on this Vegas trip but there's just something about udon that I can't get enough of. After firing up the Yelp app and scrolling through my bookmarks, we decided to come to Cafe Sanuki.  Looking through their menu was torture because everything sounded good. We ended up getting one onigiri in each flavor to-go, the #12 Mentai Cream Udon, #2 Nabeyaki Udon, and two drinks for unlimited Calpico. I friggin love Calpico.   My dish was the Mentai Cream Udon. Chewy, neutral-flavored, springy udon noodles tossed together with creamy umami-forward mentai cream sauce? I can see why this is the owner's favorite. Different layers and bites of salinity made for an interesting flavor throughout the meal. The Nabeyaki Udon was delicious and comforting with a rich and flavorful kake-based broth. It was perfect for the chilly windy weather. We ended up taking the onigiri home and it lasted fine during the five-hour drive. They also tasted great, seaweed still crispy, the next day. I'll definitely bring a cooler next time.  All in all, while this place can't replace my love for the departed udon place in Vegas, this place was definitely incredibly satisfying. It's clean with ample seating and the staff is seriously so nice! So grab a tray and load it up. You can't go wrong with Cafe Sanuki!",

Step inside and find a large menu board to choose from. Order at the first station and then move along to the area where they have tempura, gyoza, and other snacky items ready to go so you can just put them on your tray. Then, pay at the register (get your free drink by checking in) and sit down. Staff will bring your entree to you when it's done.   The interior is wonderfully decorated with Japanese items like books and small crafts. They have an extensive beverage station with a Coca Cola freestyle machine (thank you!!!) and tons of Torani drink syrups along with their signature Sanuki lemonade.   We tried their gyoza which were pretty good but sadly a bit cold even though they seemed to be under a hot lamp on the display counter.   I went for the katsu curry as well. The pork was tender and lightly fried with a hearty curry sauce with carrots and onions. The curry wasn't spicy but was still tasty. We got a few assorted tempura items also which were nicely prepared and not heavy or oily but were a bit on the cold side.   Overall this is a unique and fun way to enjoy some tasty Japanese food!",

First time I came here, I tried the beef udon, which personally seemed way too sweet, like they'd put too much sugar in the broth. I had also ordered takoyaki, but it barely had any octopus in it compared to other takoyaki I'd had in town.  I didn't really like it the first time, but I've come back a few times since then, ordering the tonkotsu shoyu udon and the Kake udon. I like both of them a lot, and I order depending on how hungry I'm feeling (the Kake udon feels like a smaller portion but whether or not it really is, I'm not sure). I've also started eating onigiri for the sides, and while they're also smaller than others for sale around town and feel sometimes dry (probably from being put under the heat lamp) they taste fine. Best part of this place is the refills you can get of Calpico!",

I still don't care much for it, but we did finish the dishes so there's that!  This food was...heavy. The udon falls in your stomach like an anchor in a deep sea. I think it was mostly due to the Seafood Tomato Cream $9.80. Thick sauce, thick udon and plenty of seafood. Surprisingly i thought it all worked here, very delicious, so plentiful it must be shared.   The next udon dish was the Shoyu Tonkatsu $7.80. Good broth, might've been a tad too salty for me but the broth was clean. The chashu was meh but the egg was good. I am 50-50 on this one on recommendation. Probably leaning on the no.  Pork Belly Bao $2.95 - Not much to say. Lacked a bit in taste and honestly could've gone without it but my gf was hungry so this happened. The pork belly was half fatty half lean which is great. The slaw had no taste but yay the bun was soft. I personally would not get this again.  All in all, I think come only if you're an udon connoisseur or lover. Huge LIKE on the drinks fountain, the Cafe Sanuki pink lemonade was excellent! The calpico also really enjoyable.",

Quality of the food was decent especially for the price. Went a little overboard trying out their chicken karaage; that thing larger than the size of my palm. The shrimp tempura hit the spot which made for a great compliment to the Niku Udon. Definitely worth a try if you're in Chinatown.",

    "text": "Cafe Sanuki is located in Chinatown, a few miles from The Strip. Found in the same plaza as Big Lots and right next door to Dotty's Gaming & Spirits.   My husband and I decided to come by here for a late lunch this past Saturday, around 1:15 pm. It wasn't busy, there were only 2 people ahead of me in line and only a few tables occupied.   If you are newbie to Cafe Sanuki, the set up is cafeteria style. This casual eatery specializes in udon but you can also order rice bowls/ plates, tempura, spam musubi and appetizers. You grab a black tray and then head down the small line. Order at the counter in the middle. And then pay at the end where the register is. From where you order to the register, you can add tempura items that are just sitting out if you wish. But these items may be cold since it is just sitting out and not under a heat lamp. So you can actually ask the staff to make a new one for you if you prefer.  Anyways after you pay, you will be given a pager and your item will be brought out to your table. But if you ordered a simple rice bowl, you may be able to have your item ready for you where you order.   After browsing the menu, we ended up ordering:  Pork Belly Bao,$2.95 prior to tax- Messy but a pretty tasty bao. Great tender meat, pretty flavorful. The shredded carrots and purple lettuce is a nice added touch for texture and crunch. But I do want to mention that the bottom of the bao is a little soggy with the sauce and pork belly.   Salmon Rice Roll, $1.75 prior to tax- I opted for this but wouldn't really recommend it. I probably would get the spam musubi in the future. There is just a small amount of salmon inside and was bland. But I think would make a good snack for later instead of with my meal.   #6 Clam Udon, $8.80 prior to tax- My husband ordered this and it had quite a bit of clam. The soup had a great seafood taste, that was light and not too salty. The udon itself had a great chew and was just perfect. The portion size for one bowl is pretty good for one person.   Mini Curry Bowl, $2.95 prior to tax with any udon order- Unfortunately the pork bowl is no longer available in a mini version, per the employee taking my order. But said that one without meat would be so I decided to just get this. I wanted to have a light lunch since we had plans to eat at a buffet later for dinner. I thought the curry flavor was good and wasn't overpowered by one ingredient. And although the mini bowl looked rather small, it actually filled me up and I was full for a handful of hours (but I am typically a light eater). I think this would make for a good meal for anyone if they add some tempura to this mini bowl to round it out a bit.   Drink, $2.50 prior to tax- Free with Yelp check in! I ended up getting calpico, the sweet and some what tangy drink that you are familiar with at the Asian markets. Only the original flavor is available here and tasted perfect. Free unlimited refills here by the way.  ------------------------------ (Total= $17.81 after tax and Yelp check in offer)  Service was very friendly. The employee taking my order at the counter was nice and made small talk with me as I was trying to decide what I wanted to order. And the girl at the register was friendly. When I told her it was my first time here, she called out \"we have a first timer\" and the employees all shouted out \"first timer\", lol. You can tell the employees here have a good time here and generally get along.   Wait time for our food was not long. A little less than 10 minutes and our food was brought over to us by a smiling employee.   The restrooms are in the back. The ladies restroom was clean upon this visit and adequately stocked with the essentials (please note that it is a single toilet in the ladies).   There is free WiFi here and plenty of clean tables.   We really enjoyed our food here and wish to come back here in the future on our next Vegas vacation. There are numerous of udon combinations that I would love to try.",

Does it even mix well together? Well, surprisingly they made this pretty good. Although it was pretty heavy and hearty, the flavors were there.   Nebayaki - Soup not too salty which i liked. Everything was good but the meat was a bit dry and stringy (too many connective tissue, a more tougher brisket kind of cut) so not for the ones who doesn't care for the chewy type of meat cuts.  Seafood tomato cream - this is there best seller and i sure sold to me. Cant go wrong with this one. Teriyaki Steak plate - Not bad but had better on this one.  Pork belly bao - This was juicy but nothing super crazy about but a must try at least once kind of thing.  Rice rolls - definitely a must (snack food) for the road, always for me. Refreshing and not heavy and perfect for the rice & blander food type lovers!!  They have an open drink (sorry non-alcoholic) bar which includes assorted types of iced tea, sodas, hot tea and favorite of all, unlimited calpico!!  Prices a bit on the higher end but not super bad. So will definitely be back whenever im back in town!   Staff are super nice and parking was small but descent.",

    "text": "The Skinny: go for the udon, tempura and the lemonade, skip the curry katsu (3.5) service: great for a counter service restaurant (4) value: for the quality and ambience, this place is great (4)  The hubby wanted to come here to try their curry katsu (not sure why as it is more focused on udon) so we came in for lunch.  I had a hard time choosing from all the options. It was exciting watching the noodle maker cooking fresh noodles in the large pot. I ended up getting a bowl of niku udon with a garlic miso pork belly mini bowl which I shared with my toddler. We also bought a few tempura to try (sweet potato, kabocha squash).  We used the Yelp check-in to get a free drink too.  Okay, the niku udon was good solid rendition. The noodles had a nice texture and flavor. The kiddo gobbled up her portion and was quite content. The garlic miso bowl was also quite tasty and would easily recommend.  The tempura batter was light and crisp. It's self service for the dipping sauce at the condiments station.  Their specially blended house-made lemonade was dubbed \"baby crack\" by the end of the visit. My kid barely came up to breathe as she sucked the delicious concoction through the straw. The rest of the day, all she could talk about was how much she wanted more lemonade. The lemonade is very different from traditional lemonade - it's less acidic and slightly more creamy(?). It's not quite yuzu, and maybe the creaminess may have some coconut overtones to it? It's really hard to pinpoint what it is but it is good.  The only disappointment was the curry katsu. The curry was a little thin and generic tasting while the batter kind of just fell off the pork chop.   As a restaurant, it is pretty great place for kids. The area and high chairs are clean. The restaurant staff is very nice and helpful. They came by and offered my daughter her first taiyaki (she liked this too but not as much as the lemonade). Service is quick and efficient. Only thing is the bathroom does not have a changing table for those with younger children.  For a quick bite, this place is hard to beat at these prices. Add in the friendly staff and ambience, this place warrants return visits. (4).",

What pains me the most is the freshly made onigiri photos that are handmade, but if you order it, you get the Asian 7-11 rice balls. So not cool.  I wanted this place to be as good as people rated it but at the end, it's just a buncha kids who never traveled hyping it up.  I say this because on flamingo down the street from Jinya Ramen is oodle of noodle. It's such a corny name but that place has way better udon and their mentiako cream udon is the EXACT SAME PRICE.  This place is just a cafeteria,  they should not be charging restaurant prices.   So why not 1 star?  They are friendly and their business model seems on point.  The food is meh,  some dishes overly seasoned.  Not that it should matter but sadly it does,  no one behind the counter who is cooking is Japanese.",

There is an open kitchen where you can see everything being made. The system is really easy to understand when ordering. The udon soups are really great. The noodles are amazing, and the broths they use are very good. They even have really creative udon dishes like carbonara and seafood tomato.  Cafe Sanuki also has tempura. They were light and crispy. If you don't want udon, you can get a rice bowl. I tried the pork belly bowl, it was quite good. Hopefully they will carry oden soon, that stuff is awesome.   The service was awesome, everyone was super friendly and eagar to assist.  I will definitely be back, this is a great idea, and the food is quick and really well done.",

For the price, the food was not as good as I was expecting. The mini curry and rice tasted mediocre at best. The tempura offerings were slim at the time we went. However, there were not a lot of people in the restaurant which makes me question why they were not restocking the tempura for the next rush of people. The carbonara udon was served in an overly big bowl which was interesting presentation wise but didn't help much with taste. My girlfriend and I have had udon carbonara before and Cafe Sanuki's take on it has much to improve on. The sauce stuck to the noodles which made the dish dry after mixing and not as creamy as when the dish first arrived. There was an overabundance of cheese mixed in and as a topping which overpowered every other flavor. The amount of cheese that was served with this dish made it hard to eat. We finished all of it solely because we didn't want our money to go to waste. The only thing preventing this review from going down to two stars is the service. The staff was kind and friendly which made ordering a breeze. Most likely will not be coming back here.",

It's a cheap eat break from all of the overpriced food on the strip and the portions are very generous. I always get the Niku beef udon and a mini braised pork belly bowl. The seasoned beef in the udon is delicious and the noodles are always fat and chewy. The broth is so good and you can always add spice or flavor with the condiments that they have out. The mini braised pork belly is so so good and so worth the price of $4 - they give you 3 fat slices of marinated pork belly with rice. Also if you check in on yelp you get a free drink! They have lots of drink options, including that customizable drink machine as well as iced teas and Calpico. I love getting their peach cream soda. Can't say enough about this place - try making a stop if you're visiting Vegas, it's only about a 10 minute drive from the Strip!",

Half of us had our food ready and the other half had to wait for their food to finish up. 10 minutes into the wait we start eating because we didn't want the food to get cold. We tell our family to ask about the food a couple minutes later to find out our food was given away to the wrong family. Upset and disappointed, we were told to wait a little longer for a fresh plate to be made. 3 minutes later, the rest of the food arrived. Truthfully, our appetites were crushed. Half of the family's meal was already done, and the other half of us barely started eating. It was an upsetting experience, but only to be fixed by their employee Jasmine. Jasmine, you are the reason we will continue to eat there. Your service and understanding of the situation is so caring and my family deeply appreciates it. Thank you so much for creating a resolution to the problem. Jasmine you are 5 stars!! Thank you so much",

The Bao itself was off, soggy and not tasting great. the pork belly was alright but not spectacular.  The staff were great in helping with ordering since the flow is not exactly logical.",

The tomato cream with seafood offered a decent amount of seafood, more than I would have expected at the price. The wide array of tempura left my table craving more and by the end of the meal everyone's bowls were scraped clean.  The restaurant was a fun new experience, with great food, friendly staff, and affordable prices. What more could you as for?",

    "text": "This cafe goes into to such detail from start to end and as a former Data Analyst and software manager, I appreciate the well thought out detail. When you first walk in, there is a showcase of plastic food showing you the scale of  what you will be eating.  For the visually inclined this is a dream come True. The details, the details! The menu items are all in pictures with the name and a corresponding number. Just in case you mutilate the pronunciation, I am not naming names here, I am just saying! The ordering process is simple and has the efficiency of a well managed school cafeteria. You grab a tray, place your order by number or well spoken food item name and receive your food. Then you move along, see if you want to pick up a little extras and then pay for your food as well as order your drink.  I wanted a rice dish but I also wanted the freshly made udon, so I ordered both- problem solved. For my rice dish, I ordered the #19 the Curry Rice with Pork Katsu and the #5 Kamaage Udon. The Kamaage Udon comes straight from the cauldron of noodles so it is saltier and comes with dipping sauces. So the Kamaage Udon comes in a bucket, I am not joking. A big bucket of noodles, that is so my thing The noodles were fresh and simple, you could taste the purity of the noodles without the distraction of toppings.  The Curry Rice with Katsu was quite alright. The rice was rice and the katsu was a generous size. It was crispy and tender, very good! The curry, I think it was good. I mean I ate it. For the price of $7.45 I will not complain but it was a bit generic but it could also be my taste buds.   Everyone who worked at this new Cafe were top-notch kind and helpful. Definitely a place that I will come back to with all of it's details! All in all, the new Cafe Saunuki is pretty solid with food for the prices they charge.",

The cafeteria style, Japanese dining is a unique casual way to impress anyone especially when your udon noodle is made in house! The amazing food displays are \"actual\" size versions of what you'll be stuffing your face into! And the BEST part? Entire menu is under $10! They have a wide variety of side dishes (tempura , rice rolls and oden). Check in on Yelp to get your FREE drink!  The super friendly staff eagerly greets you and recommends their most well liked dishes such as the seafood tomato cream, yaki udon or kamatama udon. I ordered the seafood tomato cream and it was delicious! The tomato sauce, cream, and seafood blended well together. The consistency was neither too creamy nor watered down. The udon was cooked perfectly without being too chewy. And wow, $9.95 is definitely a bargain for the generous portions of shrimp, squid, mussels, and fish they provide.  The owner took some time to chat with us. He stated the soft boiled eggs they use are shipped direct from Japan! All ingredients are fresh. In fact they do not have any freezers in the kitchen. They do not use MSG or other artificial flavors in their dishes. They have a self serve bar for your warm tempura sauce and drinks where you have an option to pump your own Torani syrups with all kinds of flavors. The open and airy dining area gives you a welcoming atmosphere. I can't wait to come back and try their rice bowls of goodness!",

Cafeteria-style where you choose your udon or rice bowls, then pick out your tempuras and oden (fish cakes).  Large portions sure to leave you full.   Try the creamy lemonade! Very different from anything I've had.   They close between lunch and dinner to prepare fresh noodles.   Not all onigiri options were available, even though they were advertised, such as the plum, which I was badly craving! That was a bummer.   Don't expect the best quality udon, but expect it to be yummy, fast, & cheap- just what I need most times!",

    "text": "This is as good as it gets. Upon coming here, you can notice that it is very similar to an authentic udon bar found in Japan (as said by my boyfriend, who has been to many udon places in Japan). When you come in, you see a display of plastic udon bowls, giving an example of what to expect. It's similar to a buffet line; you grab a tray and tell the chefs what you want. After you grab your udon or rice bowl, you are lead to a line of 8-10 different types of tempura. You grab a plate and get as many or as little tempura pieces as you want. At the very end of the line, you end up at the cash register and pay for your food.   Now to the food. The food here is AMAZING. The udon was clearly fresh and had a good bite to it. The broth was tasty and not overpowering. The beef pieces were thinly sliced and tender. The tempura were all crispy and the veggies used for them (as I had the pumpkin and sweet potato) were lightly seasoned and delicious. The surprising part of the meal was how delicious their lemonade was! It's sweet but not too sweet while having a slight tartness to it. In addition, it also had a hint of the lemon rind in the drink.   If you really enjoy your udon, do yourself a favor and try this authentic Japanese place out.",

There's plenty of places to sit and the atmosphere is nice and quite and very clean. The staff is also really friendly and willing to help out if you're confused on what to get. They also have a big beverage selection including: Calipico! And with a yelp check in you get a free drink everytime.

Although we did not notice when we entered , the sign outside clearly indicates they close at 3:00 pm. We love Japanese ramen and was hoping to give this new place a try. Being a former restaurant manager myself, I understand the needed to close to clean and restock BUT proper business ethics dictates to follow business hours indicated on printed posted announcements. As potential paying customers, the female employee should have exercised better customer service and hospitality rather than simply telling us that they are closed and then quickly walking away....tsk tsk tsk poor judgement....",

Clam udon - soup is a little bland 3. Spicy tantan udon - taste good but pork is a little dry 4. Shoyu Tonkatsu - good flavor 5. Niku udon - my kids' favorite.  As many reviews said, the restaurant has a pretty good variety of food. It's fairly priced for a fairly good amount of food and flavor. Staff is friendly and food comes in a timely manner. Restaurant and the restrooms are clean too.  I got free drink for checking on yelp. Tried the lemonade but it was too sugary and watered down. And I can taste bitterness, either from the seed or the lemon peel. But calpico yogurt drink is good. Haven't had it for a long time.   Will definitely come back next time we visit the Sin City",

    "text": "Cafe Sanuki was the newest addition to the many udon places that were popping up in town. My review was based on the their soft grand opening.   Their make their udon fresh from scratch and you can watch their action from the glass while you order your food.   First, you waited in line to pick your udon/ rice bowl. They have over twenty udon variety from kake, bukake, carbonara, clam, tomato based, etc. They also have rice curry bowls as side order or main dish (BIG bowl).   Second, you pick your sides: shrimp tempura, fish cakes and vegetable tempuras, spam musubi (yes they have it too), salmon or spicy tuna wrap, etc.  Last, you pick your drinks. Their lemonade is fresh squeezed and it's pretty good. They also have bottomless specialty brewed tea by Harney and Sons, peach, tropical green, etc. If you like sweet, they have syrups with many different flavors to add to your tea.  I tried their tropical green and it's very refreshing! If you check-in on Yelp, drink is on the house.   I tried their Kitsune Udon with side of shrimp and vegetables tempura. I liked it, udon was perfect, chewy and not soggy. My kake udon soup was also delicious. I also tried their Carbonara and Yaki udon and they were delightful. The bowl for Carbonara or Yaki udon were HUGE, bigger than my head.   Today is my second visit and will come back again with friends and families.",

    "text": "It's only the soft-opening for this restaurant and I was already impressed which doesn't always happen. My friends and I went here for a late lunch after the gym. We had our names on the guest list but there was still at least a 30-minute wait. Normally, I'd be raging from being hangry but something told me it'll be worth the wait.  They started running out of food but what I had planned on eating were still available. Yay! Despite the madness, I can't say enough good things about the owner, Henry and the kitchen staff - they were proud of their product and handled pressure with such amazing positivity, calmness and grace. They were in the flow.   We tried a few things from the menu and we can't wait until they're officially in full operation. I'm especially excited to try their Taiyaki in the future as the ones available in this town have been major letdowns.  Carbonara Udon: This has got to be my go-to udon. The noodles has the perfect texture. The sauce to noodle ratio was spot on. What makes their version stand out is that they use small pieces of pork belly instead of thin slices of bacon. 5/5  Niku Udon: Noods in a hot beefy broth worthy of a big loud slurrrrrppp!!! #ilovemesomemeat 5/5  Tempura: They have a nice variety of breaded, deep-fried artery-clogging goodness: Shrimp, Chicken, Fish Cake, sweet potato, etc. 5/5  Miso Garlic Pork Belly Rice: Thinly sliced pork belly on a bowl of rice. The miso garlic juices mixed with the fatty pork should be enough to get you excited. 5/5  Lemonade: I'd typically say \"when life gives you lemons, hope they're Lululemon\"...this has got to be the first time I've ever liked lemonade by itself. I've given lemonade way too many chances - it's either too damn tart or diabetes-inducing sweet. Theirs was just right. Henry has every right to be proud of his version of lemonade. I was so excited to get my refill on but they were out! I wish I could do more than 5/5 but that's just a wrong rating system so, yeah, I'd settle with 5/5  My other friends tried the curry udon but we weren't about sharing today. As soon as we got our food, it was every man for himself on don't-talk-to-me-I'm-eating mode.  Henry was doing his rounds when they've pretty much sold out on everything. He was apologetic but honestly, there's nothing to be sorry for. Service, food, lemonade, price...just can't be beat! I've found my new favorite udon place.",

    "text": "UPDATED.. 2nd Review  So I couldn't help myself and went back 2 more times. Who could pass up their 30% off pre grand opening special!?! Not me lol   Service was good as usual. Everyone was very friendly and attentive. There was always someone running back and forth to help clear the tables and wipe them down for new customers to sit and eat. If I were to leave a suggestion it would be to have a place for us customers to help put our own dishes and throw our trash away since it is more of a self serve restaurant. I'm sure that would help the workers when the lunch and dinner rush comes through. (IKEA has these covered stalls for us to put our dirty trays with dishes in ..maybe that is something useful that may be added to this lovely place)   Kamatama Udon - Very good! Talk about egg porn! Udon is served hot with a raw yolk on top from eggs that are imported from Japan. Chef said these were special eggs from vegetarian fed chickens. Broth/Sauce is served on the side for you to pour over your Udon. Break that yolk and let it ooze all over Udon. Enjoy!  Carbonara Udon - Good. Nice and creamy with chunks of pork belly in it. Pork belly was a little hard and chewy for my taste tho   Curry Udon / Rice Bowl - Good. Flavorful but nothing out of the ordinary. Curry taste like the one in the yellow golden box you make at home.   Miso Garlic Pork Belly Bowl - Very yummy. I love how super garlicky it is. Pork belly is sliced thin and packed with flavor topped with pickled ginger  Of course we ordered the Seafood Tomato Cream & Mentai Udon again. It was as delicious as the first time.   I posted A LOT of pictures of everything we ordered and of the restaurant. If you can't see it with my post here go find them lol Everything looks and tastes delicious. You will not be disappointed.   ...Until next time. Can't wait to try the rest of what we missed on our return trips = )",

    "text": "Disclaimer:  Attended the soft opening as one of the Facebook Pre-Opening RSVP Invited Guests on 11/14/2017.  With the Yelp check-in for a complimentary beverage, everything on this visit was comped (including my second bowl of Mentai Cream Udon)  ---------- Personal pet peeve rant: Please do not pronounce UDON like Ming Tsai (for an Asian guy that lived and worked in Japan before becoming a TV chef, it is disrespectful to purposely mispronounce a common Japanese noodle dish that he probably ate numerous times after work.  He is not some guy that might have lived their entire life having never traveled more than 30 miles in any one direction on a farm in Ohio. Udon is not pronounced U-Don. Don't trust the pronunciation provided by the US-based search engines either.  Search Youtube for \" pronounciation\" for the Japanese pronunciation. Or just ask the staff that works at Cafe Sanuki. ----------  The display of life like menu items made of plastic in the glass display definitely reminded me of the Japanese restaurants my parents took me to when I was growing up in Taiwan and visited on vacations in Japan, S.Korea and even Thailand.  It is not as common nowadays, especially in Nevada, probably due to the cost of these boarder line works of art. But having a visual representation of what you can expect to receive before ordering is nearly priceless. Plus photos, even really really good ones, can only do so much.  Bonus points for that authenticity feel!  So after I verified that I was at the right address, by stepping back into the parking lot to double check the signage on the outside of the building, I was immediately greeted by two lovely hostesses with a clipboard to check in.  I was given a laminated voucher to redeem at the cashier, and suggested to check out the fresh udon being prepared by a machine right on the other side of the glass partition.  The machine is a sheeter, that rolls the dough into the desired thickness, and then feed through the machine to be cut into individual thick strips of udon noodles.  After it is cut, the udon is dusted with some type of flour (guessing wheat flour) to keep it from sticking together, and toss into boiling water to cook for just a brief period of time.  Very simple process.  The tricky part is deciding what to order in this cafeteria-style udon-bar restaurant. Just looking at their menu, they appear to have at least 16 Udon preparations to satisfy your need for udon noods. Plus 4 options of Rice Bowls (Options: Beef, Curry, Chicken & Egg, and Miso Garlic Pork Belly in regular and mini size options). After placing your udon orders, there are also tempura-fried appetizers that can be selected to compliment your udon entree.  Plus they have 8 different Onigiri (Japanese Rice Balls with different fillings: Spicy Tuna, Tuna Mayo, Salmon, Spam, Mentai, Plum, Kunbu, and Inari), and in the near future Oden selections and Taiyaki (a type of dessert in the shape of a baked fish (sea bream) cake with traditionally filled with Japanese red bean paste filling.  What I ended up ordering are #11 Seafood Tomato Cream and #12 Mentai Cream Udon.  Both of these udon entrees are served in oversized bowls (large enough to fit probably the Costco pack of 2 watermelons or a basketball), which then made the udon portions look deceptively tiny. Plus one of the hostess also asked if I wanted to try a mini Rice Bowl, which I could not refused. And while waiting to get to the cashier, I also picked up a single tempura-fried shrimp (pretty good and the shrimp is not the tiny pinky-sized shrimps often served at the lower-end Japanese or AYCE sushi restaurants) on a tray next to the other tempura-fried appetizers and Japanese \"fritters\" often served on the side to compliment the udon noodles.  Overall, I thought the price range is reasonable ($5.50 to $9.95), even without the soft opening 30% off discount, and the selection of udon noodles toppings and preparation are pretty extensive.  Plus there is the option to serve some of the udon entrees cold instead of hot, just like in Japan and numerous iconic dishes from around the globe during the summer or winter (e.g., Vichyssoise, aka Potato Leek Soup).  The biggest appeal, besides the convenient location (Decatur and Spring Mountain), is that it is a fast, relatively healthy meal on a short lunch break or for dinner after a long day at work.  Also they have one of those fancy Coke Freestyle Soda Machines with the touch sensitive monitor that you can navigate to dispense up to 144 different beverages. Plus they also have 5 flavors of fresh brew Harney & Sons fruit teas and 8 different syrups to further customize your drinks.  But I totally recommend not trying any of that, especially the sodas, until you have tried Cafe Sanuki's House Blend Lemonade (it is not too sweet, have a pleasant citrus note that I can not quite place).  Give them a try, before Cafe Sanuki gets too popular and the wait is long.  4 stars!",

    "text": "Cafe Sanuki is by far my favorite ramen spot ever.  I normally get the Shoyu Pork.  I have also eaten the yaki udon.  The portion size for the udon noodles is just enough to fill me up and I have a healthy appetite.  The yaki udon is huge and you will definitely have left overs.  It can definitely feed two people easily.  I have been to many ramen and Japanese spots and nothing compares to the way they season the pork.  I will never eat at another ramen spot again.  I have visited several and I keep coming back.  The broth is amazing and so is the pork.  Its marinated just right.  I do highly recommend the egg in tempura. It's just right. The egg just melts right in your mouth.   When you first walk in they have visual plates of what the food items look like.  I am a visual person and love to see what the items I'm ordering look like. It's different to see it on a picture in a menu as opposed to right in front of you made of plastic. There menu is set up on screens kind of like a cafeteria style restaurant and they cook you what you want right then and there.  The workers will come and deliver your food directly to you once its ready.  Also if you check in on yelp you can receive a free drink.  The staff is super friendly, and they also take your tray and food when you are done eating.  Even before you can even stand up to return the trays to the trash area.  They are really on top of their game there.  The restaurant is clean, and the wait time to get the food for it to be fresh is extremely fresh.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this restaurant..  I will never get my noodles from anywhere else.",

    "text": "Cafe Sanuki is a restaurant on our regular rotation. It's a cafeteria style set up where you grab a tray, tell the kitchen your order (sometimes it's ready in a minute), peruse the hot foods readily available and pay.  Sometimes they give you a number for your table and they will bring the food out to you.  When you are done eating, there's an area for you to return your trays and bring your dirty dishes.  We went during their soft opening and found a hair. They fixed it right away and addressed it.  So I appreciated that it wasn't overlooked. At one point, we dropped our bowl on the floor and the server nearby said she would get a us a new one.  She brought over a new bowl but our food was on the floor.  Nonetheless, they have since taken effort to gain our business and we do go back.    It's a bit challenging to maneuver the trays when you are trying to corral the kids, but we manage.  Sometimes they do offer to help us bring the trays to the table if they see you are struggling and they have the extra hands available.  The kids particularly enjoy the Seafood Tomato Cream dish. We went this past weekend and had the Vegetarian Tomato Basil with cream added since the kids didn't want the seafood in it.  That was well liked again.  The Husband and I usually bounce around the Soup Udon menu - Cold, Warm, and Hot.  We've tried the Niku Beef Udon, the Shoyu Pork, the Kake Udon, the Ontama Udon, the Zuru Udon, the Kamaage Udon, and probably a few others.  We've also had the Katsu Curry Rice, the Braise Pork Belly, the Beef Bowl Gyudon, various tempura, and the Pork Belly Bao.  There hasn't been any dish we haven't like, so that's a good thing.  Sometimes they have FB discounts or a free drink with Yelp check-in.  We particularly love the bottomless Cafe Sanuki house blend lemonade and the Calpico.  You can also register on Clover for more perks.  Overall, it's nice to have Cafe Sanuki in our rotation for a casual lunch.",

They have multiple flavors and variations depending on your mood.  And if that's not your thing, you can enjoy some other nice rice dishes too.  What also makes this place an over the top udon joint, is there all you can drink Calipico soft drink well along with other flavors.    Can't wait to go back and try the other dishes!",

    "text": "Visited with some friends that we actually consider family!  We came to Cafe Sanuki on their suggestion!  What a find!  These folks know their UDON!  I love me any kind of noodles, but Cafe Sanuki specialized in soup udon, cold & warm udon, and saute udon dishes.  Even on a hot day the udon hit the spot!  They also do different Japanese bowls/plates, as well as appetizers like tempura and rice rolls!  Like musubi, but fancier!  The fam & I tried:  -Kake Udon (with an extra serving of udon added) -Katsu Curry Rice -Salmon Rice Roll -Tuna Mayo Rice Roll  Tasty, casual restaurant fare!  The Kake Udon was nice & hot, broth was light but had a very clean seaweed flavor.  So easy to eat an entire bowl!  The Katsu Curry Rice was good too, pork tonkatsu was friend perfectly and still juicy...and I have no problem with Japanese-style curry!  Great accompaniment with the tonkatsu and lots of rice!  My only thing was I wish there was a few more veggie chunks in the curry.  Still was good eats though!  The rice rolls were pretty basic but still yummy in the cute little packages.  They were light on flavor but after a dash of some soy sauce they were back up to par!  I really liked the Tuna Mayo one.  We'll be back for some easy dining at Cafe Sanuki!  The food was good, the prices were reasonable, and the charm of the Japanese decor was fun.  Anime playing on the TV!  Manga to read on the shelves!  Seems like a great place to eat & hang out!  Oishi!!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I like coming here because there are a scarce amount of udon places in vegas, sadly! Cafe Sanuki offers more than udon, but offers a cool Japanese cafeteria experience.   The first time we came here, we ordered the curry and cold udon, which were good but wasn't quite the Japanese curry that we were looking for! But we decided to give this place a second chance because it seemed to more about the udon than the curry, and we were right!   This time I ordered the niku udon and my boyfriend ordered the kake udon, and shared a side of gyoza. Good choice! The beef udon was full of flavor! Could have used a little bit larger pieces of beef but the flavor was on point and the amount of noodles given for me was plenty.   The gyoza was a nice touch as a side and completed the meal. They had a nice crisp and the flavor from the sauce made it that much better.   At checkout we were pleasantly surprised that with checking in on yelp, we got a free drink. Which was pleasant because of the Calpico machine they had available as well as their Sanuki lemonade! TIP: mix them both together, you will be pleasantly surprised!  This place is great for a Japanese fix, something not too heavy and not too fancy. Will be back here again!",

    "text": "Not feeling like eating Ramen my girl and I defaulted to our usual Udon place Cafe Sanuki. Cafe Sanuki is one of our usual haunts if we're around Spring Mountain since they offer a good variety of delicious Udon bowls.  Parking is pretty easy to get and seating is always pretty plentiful. Immediately as you enter through the doors there is a big glass display of the various Udon bowls, curry and rice dishes they provide recreated in colorful plastic. The food looks semi-realistic like a frozen Hans Solo in carbonite. There's also Japanese pop music playing over the speakers.  The ordering process is very cafeteria-esque in that you grab a tray and tell the staff what main dish you want and they prepare it for you behind the counter. There's a couple of large televisions screens that have photos with associated numbers so you can order by number if you can't read or write like me. Further along in the counter line there is also a fried food station that offers a variety of tempura items (shrimp, white fish, veggies, etc) and some onigiri. Toward the end is the cashier where you pay for the items you ordered and add a drink option. Cafe Sanuki doesn't offer any desserts, but there are plenty of other places around you can get your sweet tooth on. After paying you find a seat and start eating, however if whatever you ordered takes a bit longer to prepare someone from the staff will deliver to you at your table.  Here's what we ordered and what we thought: -Carbonara - This is Udon with a white cream sauce and little pieces of pork scattered throughout. It was delicious and what I usually order. The flavor was good and the pork belly pieces were very tasty. Order this unless you want a more watery broth. -Kake Udon (added one egg) - This is the most basic Udon bowl. Noodles were large and soft, fish cake was standard issue, broth was clear and tasted fine. Get this for a no nonsense bowl of Udon. -Mini Curry Rice Bowl - This is a pretty basic rice bowl with curry, ginger and green onions. If you order the actual Curry Bowl then there will be some pork tonkatsu pieces included. However we ordered this in order to try the curry flavor and it wasn't bad. Order this if you need an extra item to fill your belly similar to how fries are a side dish to fill you up if your burger just isn't enough OR remember how Jek Porkins is taken out so quickly in Star Wars A New Hope without really contributing to the rebellion's fight. I mean he probably helped by drawing fire and heat from the Death Star guns to allow the other guys like Luke to have an easier time, but really he wasn't necessary. So yeah, treat the Mini Curry Bowl in terms of usefulness like Jek Porkins. Get or skip. Probably skip. -Shrimp Tempura - This was delicious. The tempura wasn't too oily the shrimp size was large and the crunch was satisfying. Satisfying like seeing Princess Leia strangle Jabba with her slave chain. Get this unless you don't like shrimp or loved Jabba. If you liked Jabba then you have issues. -Tempura Fish Cake - The fish cake is large and like the shrimp the tempura was fried well. This was good. Get this if you like fish cake. -Chicken Karaage - This wasn't that great. The chicken pieces were large and although the seasoning was fine, the chicken to surface area ratio of the chicken wasn't favorable. Skip this. -Pumpkin Tempura - This was good, crispy, and it had the nice starchy flavor/texture that only comes from a gourd. Take this or leave it depending on whether you like pumpkin.  Overall Cafe Sanuki is definitely worth a visit to get some Udon. The prices are reasonable, seating is plentiful, and the music is Japanese and not the music from the Star Wars cantina.  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2Fa55z9NJEN1s&s=10dcb319ae816e70b3c755bbc1b026d418c8651886cb83b4cd72cc89d2c6d816\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtu.be/a55z9NJEN1s</a>  P.S. I apologize for making too many Star Wars references.",

    "text": "We've tried really good udon, from Tokyo to those hidden gem noodle houses in LA & Torrance, CA and I have to say Cafe Sanuki's is on par. The ordering system is cafeteria style where you walk in, get a tray and pick your dishes or order them at the counter if it isn't there. I've been wanting to try their Carbonara Udon after seeing it on their Instagram page and I wasn't disappointed. The Carbonara sauce (not just a dressed up Alfredo) was authentic-tasting, right down to the generous sprinkling of hand-cut bacon chunks--yes, chunks, not those commercialized dried bacon bits found in shakers. My wife opted for the more traditional Niku Beef Udon which boasts Sanuki's rich and flavorful signature broth topped with green onions, tender marinated beef and thick and soft udon! Cafe Sanuki's price is also on point, which is why we also tried a few side dishes like their Takoyaki and Pork Belly Bao. There's more on the menu we'd love to try so it's a safe bet to say we'll be back. We're just happy there's finally a good udon shop here in Las Vegas (and the only one we know of that offers the Zaru/Zuru Udon!",

    "text": "While my friends and I have had Cafe Sanuki on our list of places to try for quite some time, I have to admit they've never really been a priority for us.  Instead, we ended up making our way to spots like Shang Artisan Noodles, Pho Kim Long, and Monta Ramen.  However, after Udon Monzo shuttered, you can bet Cafe Sanuki moved to the top.  Not to say that the two are related, but considering how Udon Monzo folded despite their awesome reviews (and udon, presumably), we weren't going to take a chance these guys might end up shuttering on us as well!  Fashioned with the same cafeteria-style set-up as Marukame Udon in Hawaii, Cafe Sanuki had me feeling all kinds of excited as soon as we walked inside.  The wealth of open seats and lack of a line didn't hurt (we got here about 45 mins before closing and were starving), but their menu looked pretty legit (and not just because I was hungry).  Nearly two dozen varieties of udon (in soup or sauce, hot or cold), rice bowls/plates, and an array of sides (assorted types of tempura, gyoza, baos, onigiri, etc.).  -- NIKU BEEF UDON...$7.80 -- SHRIMP TEMPURA...$1.75 -- WHITE FISH TEMPURA...$1.90 -- SWEET POTATO TEMPURA...$1.25 -- TAKOYAKI (3pcs)...$2.80 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe-sanuki-las-vegas-2?select=yQ7iAtpjV3lmnF9xHNlpvw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe...</a>) The udon itself was solid, and the beef wasn't bad (wish the shreds were bigger), but the broth could've been a little richer/more flavorful.  As for the tempura, the sweet potato didn't do much for me, but the fish was great.  Kind of weird how they don't list the type, but it was crispy and quite tasty.  Lastly, much like with the shrimp tempura, the takoyaki was more or less fine - crispy on the outside, but I wish it had more octopus.  -- PORK BELLY BAO...$2.95 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe-sanuki-las-vegas-2?select=g2kJD4d8NqlhL8bnE_u7nw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe...</a>) Beyond being a small sample size (my friend and I split it), this wreaked of cilantro (yuck), so I'm biased.  That being said, I still thought this was just okay.  The slaw didn't help, but I didn't care much for the sauce and, as a whole, it felt kind of dry.  -- BRAISED PORK BELLY RICE BOWL...$7.80 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe-sanuki-las-vegas-2?select=T218_Bvn2eL8_C37fQY1FQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe...</a>) My friend over ordered, so we ended up sharing this among the entire group.  So again, small sample size, but I liked this.  Although a few pieces of pork weren't as juicy as others, I liked how well seasoned it was and how the shredded ginger complemented the overall flavors.  Even though we weren't overwhelmed by the majority of what we had, it should be noted that we likely didn't come at the best time either.  Given how we arrived within an hour of them closing, I imagine some of their stuff might be sitting out (tempura) and/or the last of what was left (pork belly?).  Had we come during their peak dinner service, for example, I'm sure stuff would've been hot/moist since turnover would've been higher.  All in all, while I can't say my experience here was as glowing as it was for so many others, it wasn't all that shabby either.  The udon is terrific and there are numerous varieties to choose from.  What's more, prices here are super reasonable (either that or I'm just that jaded by Bay Area prices).  Cafe Sanuki may not be nearly as good as Marukame Udon in Hawaii, but they're better than the last couple of udon joints I've tried in SF.  Given all the love they've received, I'll definitely be back to give them another shot, try more of their udon, and to see how much better it really is to come earlier in the day/evening rather than right before closing.  THREE AND A HALF STARS rounded down for now.",

When you walk in there's a display or their food. You order and pay in a mini market set up on one side of the restaurant. Seating is on the other side. Very clean and well maintained establishment. Staff was very friendly. Menu was clear, pricing was clear. I got served immediately and had some questions answered.  I choose the creamy tomato seafood udon and gyoza.  I tried the teas but I'm overall not a fan of that. I did love the Calpico, something that was new to me. The food came out quick. Everything was delicious.

Tonkatsu Shoyu was amazing as well, delicious broth but not my go to.  I love spice and for me personally it's just to bland but still good.  Their egg is boiled then deep fried which was different but not my fav.  Ooooooh and let's not forget the Spicy Miso Pork. That dish is fresh, spicy,  again a light sweetness.  It has a nuttiness to it that I just cannot get enough of.  That bowl had me at first slurrrrrp.    Place is very clean and organized.  We arrived at opening time 11:30am and by 12noon place was filling up.   I left a happy girl, money well spent.  Their prices are reasonable and you will not leave disappointed or hungry.   Till next time My Sanuki friends! \\(^-^)  *Peep the photos",

The dish I tried was #18 (Ontama w/raw egg) and I also added a beef mini bowl, total came to about $11.50 and boy was that the best cheap meal I have ever bought. Felt like I went to heaven and came back. This spot is easily a 5 star place to eat. Ill be back soon to try the rest of the menu and a much more updated review.

    "text": "So for what it is, Cafe Sanuki is good. This restaurant functions as a cafeteria style establishment with a wide variety of \"Japanese\" food. I say this with quotations because it really doesn't taste like it. I say this as a Japanese person. The food is relatively cheap, so that is a definite plus. However, the actual flavor leaves much to be desired. For example, their udon carbonara is just really cheesy and garlicy. Not exactly what carbonara tastes like. As a whole, the majority of their food tastes like americanized Japanese food. The single exception, in my opinion, are the sides they sell. The karaage, onigiri, and other fried options are redeeming factors. They taste as they should. If you do want to eat here, only get the sides, they're pretty good!",

Eyes eats first then the mouth decide what to get and order. Lol. The udon is very much fresh made and you can see them making them! Including the process of the broth, seasonings in the bowls, and their poach! Etc etc! I came in with my fiance and sister. The sister was the one who suggested to come to this place. Honestly, she ate here earlier, about 3 hours ago and she brought us here to eat. She helped herself another clam udon soup--her second bowl of the day! She really really enjoys it very much, with plenty of clams, not really salty, just the way how she likes them! I got myself a number 7, and my guy got the beef curry udon. It was spectacular soups! Must try their eggs, which the owner said he got them import it from Japan! The egg yolk is really rich and creamy--different from other eggs i have ever have, even in ramen places! This udon place reminds me one of the udon in Hawaii Waikiki. Except this place is huge and no waiting line for the food. But I don't know, we were there around 9:30 pm and they close at 10 pm. Very cheap meals. We will definitely will be back, even though it's a long drive to get here, it's worth it. Really enjoyed the atmosphere of the place. Ohh yeah, they run out of lemonade juice when we were there but it's alright. There's reason why it's out. Two thumbs up cause this place really rocks!",

Good for a casual dinner and decently affordable, if you don't add too many additional tempura items.   Staff can be a little bit in a rush because it is quick service, so they could be friendlier. Overall, pretty good place if you just want a quick filling meal and just craving the udon.",

Can't wait to go back and try more. Didn't have room for more then 2 bowls of udon and a bowl of rice lol. They have several vegetarian options.

    "text": "An efficient way to eat quality udon and oden. As others have said, this is a cafeteria-style restaurant where you grab a tray, order your udon, and choose whatever tempura, onigiri, and oden you want. I'm no connoisseur of Japanese food but I know what I like. I ordered the mentai cream udon, some tempura (asparagus, squash, and fish cake), and some oden options (radish and konjac).   The mentai cream udon was served hot with a good balance of cod roe and cream that lacked any stodginess. Part of me wished I could mop up the remaining sauce at the bottom of my colossal bowl wish some bread but that would've been overkill, I guess. The quantity was perfect so that I wouldn't be weighed down by the udon and cream. All in all, a simple but somehow still fancy dish that I would get again.   The tempura was not fresh so don't expect that piping hot, crispy goodness every time you come in. Even then, the tempura still retained some measure of crispness so it wasn't a total bust. The other thing to note is that they won't always have all the options they have labels for on the display. None of the tempura I ate retained any taste; if I closed my eyes, I would only distinguish each of my options by texture and form. All in all, you'd be fine if you skipped this.   Finally, the oden. This was my first time trying oden. You can choose whatever you want and they'll serve it all up in a bowl with some of the broth. The interesting thing about oden is that the broth tastes like whatever has been steeping in it. This can mean that it retains the flavor of whatever people don't want as much of. Anyways, the broth had some pretty good depth: strong radish flavor with a bit of the flavors of the other oden options in the background. This gave the broth a \"healthy\" or almost medicinal taste that I didn't dislike. The radish was great because your spoon would just slide into it and it more or less melted in my mouth. The konjac didn't taste like much (which is to be expected, I think) but was a great contrast in color and texture to the radish with a bounciness that is like the stiffest savory jello you can imagine. I'm grateful I could try oden in such a casual setting.   As for the ambience, it's spacious with good light and airflow. The decoration is quaint. It gets the job done. The actual dishes (bowls, etc.) and trays are very attractive to look at and make great Instagram pictures, I would imagine. It's really strange (but probably cheaper) to have plastic cups and \"silverware\" with such nice looking dishes. But that's just me nitpicking.   All in all, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but it would be a good option if I wanted a good, quick meal while I was in the area.",

My review will be based upon 2 visits.  Service: 8/10 People there are nice and usually are in a good mood. The owner is also very accommodating if ever he sees you need something. If they make a mistake, the owner will try his best to make it up to you!  Food: 9/10 I had both the curry udon and the mentai cream udon($8.80) + miso pork mini bowl(only $2.50 additional fee instead of $3.89).  If you want to get full, get the curry udon($6.80). It has a LOT of udon noodles and the curry sauce will make you want more. On the other hand, if you like creamy foods, the mentai cream noodles are for you! It was so good that I was smiling my whole way back home while driving after eating at this place. It wasn't fishy at all. The fish eggs they used were very creamy and not too salty. It's not like a carbonara pasta that makes you quit eating it after a few bites 'cuz of its intense creamy flavor. The taste was perfected so that you'll keep digging in.   Can't wait to come back here again and try their other udons!   Tip: you can either use their yelp offer of 10% off OR get a free drink by checking in.",

It really was the freshest, sweetest, and greatest textured mochi you can find around. They really do focus on quality and authenticity.

I mean don't get me wrong it was still good, but did not blow my socks like I was hoping. The broth to me could of had more flavor like more salt or soy sauce, that to me was the only thing lacking. I ordered the #1 with a sweet potato. Also ordered a mini miso pork belly which was quite tasty. I just love the combination of pork belly and it's sauce being absorbed into the white rice underneath. This did meet expectations so I recommend ordering it as a little side dish or to share. Ambiance felt authentic and a fairly good size restaurant with amble seating. Service was also helpful and polite as I would expect for a new establishment. This place was getting kind of busy as the night progressed, which is awesome for such a new business on Spring Mtn. This is definitely going to be the new udon spot since no other restaurant in Vegas has this concept. As with most places I would think this place will improve moving forward.",

We ordered the #1 # 3 and #14 with various tempura sides and of I couldn't resist the 7-11/ Lawson tuna mayo onigiri.  #1 Kake udon was lightly seasoned with a hint of fish based broth.  #3 Niku Udon nicely flavored with thinly sliced beef and onions kind of like a beef ramen but also like a beef bowl but with broth and noodles.  #14 Vegetarian Tomato basil \"dry\" base this reminded me of pasta it was very good.",

You go in, pick your broth that you want and let the server know. They have sides that you can pick from, such as shrimp tempura, vegetable tempura, chicken karaage. They also have other food options like the pork bao (which my friend wasn't too happy with).  Portion size was perfect. Broth was tasty, however it was luke warm and I'd like for it to be steaming hot. Udon itself was chewy.  Disappointed with the sides as they were cold and not fresh and crispy. The karaage was however flavorful.   I was bummed that they didn't have the correct egg for the udon I had ordered and thus had to choose something else. I would underatand if it was near closing but I went in around 8pm so dont know why they didn't have any available. The server was apologetic. Service was fairly good, everyone was very friendly.   I'll most likely go back and give it another try. By then they shpuld have the kinks worked out.",

When it was just Monzo and Oodle Noodle near this area , I thought they were good but once Cafe Sanuki opened up this place is as good as it gets. It's a great place for a quick lunch or dinner and their prices are fantastic - I love that everything is priced reasonably. Bowls range from 5.50$ to 9.95$. Mini rice bowl add-on for 2.50$ (I recommend getting their mini beef bowl). Pumpkin & broiled egg tempura were decent especially for 1-2$ each. I think you can get a filling meal here for less than 10$. They just need a few tweaks here and there but overall they did a great job w/ soft opening. The last time I came here I had their ontama udon & broth wasn't piping hot. Temperature was more lukewarm. Overall flavor & noodles were still good though. My favorite here is their Mentai Cream udon (#12). Staff were all nice and helpful too. Everyone seems to be well under control even when it gets super busy.",

I was a huge fan of the mentai udon! It has a slight seafood taste to it, but it wasn't too overpowering. Service was friendly as well! We didn't know about the Yelp check in for drinks until after we had paid for our food, but the cashier let us redeem it anyway (most places wouldn't allow that in my experience). During our meal, the employees would come by to check up on us, which doesn't happen most of the time at cafeteria-styled restaurants. I will definitely be coming back to this place everytime I'm in Vegas! :)",

Salad was good, wish they had more of seasoning since the udon is thick so it needs more sauce than they offered. Pork belly bao was ok. Bun was bigger than the picture and it felt blend. I spoke with the staff when they approached to us and asked about how the food was. They said they will take it as consideration. Their lemonade was pretty good. It was quite refreshing.  I'd like to visit Cafe Sanuki again and try other menu. Hopefully they are taking my feedback and showing some improvement next time I visit them.",

So a couple of weeks ago, all five of us visitors from Hawai'i had the Nabeyaki Udon and we all agreed, after much slurping, that this udon is the best tasting udon in Vegas. Outstanding! Price is right, don't have to wait long, simple service, great food! Then i found out that the owners brought in their own udon making machine from Japan which explains the texture and the taste! Try it and you'll like it, for sure!",

    "text": "! I was looking for a good place to get udon, and I think this is the one. You really see how much this restaurant is trying to be as similar as possible to an actual Japanese udon restaurant. From the models of the food to the imported eggs, there is so much detail in this restaurant. I've had udon before, and this blew it all out of the water. The consistency was perfect, and the broth was amazing.  When you walk in you see the model, and you can stay around it to see what you want. Then you go into the line. You get a tray and wait in line. You tell them what you want, and, depending on what you get, you get it immediately or you wait for a bit. While you walk forward, you choose your sides. At the end, you go to the cashier and they look at what you got. Then you sit down and enjoy your meal. I got the kitsune udon, since I saw it on a show. Really good, especially the broth. The fried tofu also had a very unique flavor. Someone else in my party got the curry udon, which had a delicious curry flavor. We also got a good selection of the tempura, and it was all good, especially the shrimp and chicken. The only complaint I had was that the asparagus was a little hard. All in all, I have to say that it was delicious and I will come back.   I came back and tried the Yaki Udon, which was like yakisoba, which I like. The serving is huge. There are lots of cabbage chunks and bell peppers. Even though it says it has pork, it is more just bits of pork belly, not a ton of meat like the niku. Also, even though the pork shabu udon is still on the menu, they don't serve it.   I returned and got a lot of stuff, as we had a large party. There is a new menu at the restaurant, with the pork shabu and bukakke removed. Now there is a nabeyaki udon and a House udon that is some kind of pork with a spicy miso sauce. I tried the nabeyaki, and I am glad I did. It was served in pot, and it was full of so many things. It had tempura shrimp, fish cake, beef, and an egg. The broth was also great. I got the karikage tempura as well, which was good. The lemonade was great, as it wasn't too sweet and it was kind of creamy. Also, get the calpico. It is also great.",

We also had the Kamaage udon for our table of three. I must say, WOW - The noodles, sauce and broth are on point, delicious. They do not use MSG or artificial ingredients in their dishes. This has me feeling especially great about eating here. You can easily taste the quality and freshness of the food.  The entire staff was welcoming and very helpful. Hands down, this is thee best Japanese restaurant I've eaten. You can't beat the price for the portion size, self serve tempura and quality of food. Overal, Cafe Sanuki exceeded my expectations.

Tempura - Pre-cooked and sitting on trays so don't expect it to be hot.Tried squid tempura and pumpkin tempura. Pumpkin tempura ($1.25) was nice.  Would not have the squid tempura ($1.75) again - no taste.  2.  Onigiri - salmon, spam, and konbu - good filler since it's rice (3 for $4.00) 3.  miso pork belly mini rice bowl add on for $2.50 - tasty but a little sauce drizzled on top would elevate the flavor ($3.95 non add on price) 4.  pork belly bun - not a huge thick piece of pork belly, vegetables were crisp, light flavor, could use a little more sauce ($2.95) 5.  house lemonade - liked it was not too sweet and free drink with Yelp check in  Service is very friendly and organized.  Always feels good to have people smile at you, thank you for coming in and wish you a nice rest of your day.  They keep the tables and trash area clean too.  I noticed the girl at the cash would clean the tables almost as soon as the people left. She also asked to clear trays if you looked like you were finished.  Having clean tables makes the environment pleasant to dine in.  Would return to try other dishes.  Price point is good. Can eat for around $10.  PS.  Just checked my bill.  The add on Mini Miso Garlic Pork Belly Bowl should have been $2.50 but I was charged full price of $3.95.  They don't have a display at the cash where you can see your itemized bill before signing for it.  I should have checked the bill at the restaurant.",

They have 21 and more choices you can pick on the menu but not only that Cafe Sanuki provides unlimited refills, my favorite drink is calpico (I totally recommend it!). When theirs 21 choices in the line I don't know which one to choose but I know for a fact that those noodle lovers should try out their kitsune udon it's filled with tofu, sweet soy and topped with scallions but for those who aren't noodle lovers I recommend Katsu curry rice, it's filled with a suitable amount of curry to mix perfectly with your chicken and your rice. If you want to try a new type of noodle house, then try Cafe Sanuki I have hope that you wouldn't regret it.",

There are not too many choices. Menu lacks variety. Tempura and other sides are not fresh. They were prepared and left there for a long time. Don't bother with them. Udon itself is just ok. I was hoping for fresh udon that is chewy but it is not. Everything that you want to add to the udon is additional price. Overall the value is no good. The portion is small for the price. I was hungry after eating a bowl of udon but I don't want to get a second bowl because I get sick of the same taste after a while. I've tried pan fried noodles also. Same result: small portion and just soy sauce flavor. I visited this restaurant twice and got the same feeling. Likely I will not return.",

I think the tempura is a little to pricey for one piece. The tempura prices ranges from $1.25-2.00 each. The shrimp tempura had too much breading.   The lemonade that everyone talks about is really good.  It's \"okay\" but I probably won't be back",

    "text": "Cafe Sanuki offers a vast variety of Japanese entrees and appetizers ranging from udon to rice bowls and tempura. The restaurant's unique characteristic is its cafeteria style - you grab a tray, order your dish, choose your appetizers, and pay at the register. Everything is self-serve including the drinks and utensils and because of this, there's a higher level of efficiency in wait times. The process from start to finish (including receiving your order) is usually five to ten minutes.   My absolute favorite dish is the Mentai Cream udon with a tempura (usually opt for the white fish which goes with it perfectly)! There's a dish for everyone (whether you eat pork or you're a vegetarian). The flavor is amazing. It's just the right amount of creamy (like a Western pasta) but the udon noodle is cooked to perfection.   The service is always on point, especially for being a cafeteria styled restaurant. Although you're expected to put away your own bowls and utensils upon finishing your meal, the team members will often walk by and offer to take away your empty dishes! In addition, they're always extra friendly and informative during the ordering process.   Be sure to take advantage of the 10 percent coupon or a free drink (THEY HAVE A CALPICO MACHINE AND DIFFERENT SYRUPS). You can only use one or the other but it definitely makes a difference.  If you're a lover of Japanese cuisine, I would highly recommend making a visit to this cute restaurant.",

When you enter there's a really cool fake food display of the menu and on the right you can see them making fresh udon noodles. I ordered the tomato cream udon which was highly recommended, a pork belly bao, takoyaki, and grabbed some salmon and tuna mayo onigiri to go. Two important things about this place. 1. the portions are ginormous and 2. everything is suuuper affordable, I would say most items are around $10 or less. Tomato cream udon was delicious, the sauce was so flavorful. Pork belly bao was really great and the size of a burger. Takoyaki was the best I've ever had in Vegas. It wa actually crunchy on the outside and gooey on the inside. Most places serve just a soft mess and are bland. Onigiri is great as I can't find too many places in town that sell it and with so many options for fillings too.",

    "text": "Summary: missing the attention to detail in the flavors and textures that makes udon so great. also, way too many menu items that are not udon.  Sanuki is a province of Japan famous for their udon.  Cafe Sanuki has attempted to bring this delightfully chewy noodle dish to the deserts of Las Vegas, but in our visit, we found the food itself lacking in execution.  The cafeteria udon concept is clearly inspired by the Marukame Udon chain from Japan that has locations in Hawaii and California with long lines at all hours. You order your noodle dish and load it onto your tray when made to order, picking up some tempura side dishes and rice balls along the way to the cashier.  While Cafe Sanuki offers far more fusion udon dishes than more-traditional Marukame Udon, it seems like the menu expansion has actually taken away the focus on perfectly cooked chewy noodles, savory broth and light crispy tempura that that made Marukame so popular and is the signature taste of excellent Sanuki-style udon.    The service was excellent, and the interior was well decorated and clean, but at the end of the day, we came here to get good udon but left disappointed.  If you're not too picky about your udon, then by all means this place is A-OK!  But if you've been spoiled by legit udon, then you may want to temper your expectations.",

First off, I was bummed out that they didn't serve chicken Katsu (only pork) and the curry had beef in it. I don't eat pork or beef. Ended up with the number one with two shrimp tempura and a cone sushi. Udon was standard and made to order, shrimp tempera was cold and on the small side and the cone sushi even smaller and I wasn't a fan of what little flavor in the rice seasoning. Not to sure how long the tempura was sitting there. Not much tempura options.   Check out took longer since the kitchen combined our order which needed to be separated at the register.   I'm giving this place 2 stars for trying and having lots of seating. Wish the shrimp and cone sushi was a little bigger for the price and the seasoning needs work. It would be nice to have chicken katsu if you have chicken tempura instead of only having pork katsu. Also... no beef in the curry. First time coming across beef in curry in a katsu/curry. I ate everything I ordered and still left hungry.   I rather go back to the cafeteria style udon spot in my neighborhood in West LA that is fairly new too. Much better experience.   Theres other gems in Chinatown that I rather spend money on in Las Vegas.  If you haven't been to this type of eatery before you'll probably enjoy the experience of cafeteria style. But I've been to a handful so I was hoping for a better experience. My friend who came with me said she would come back, I'm not a fan.",

    "text": "Dang, Cafe Sanuki has me on some udon craving lately after I tried it for the first time the other day. It was so good that I went back the day after just to get my hands on some cheap udon. I went for lunch, and with half of my meal left, I was already thinking of coming back for dinner. It goes to show you how much I'm obsessed with Cafe Sanuki.  I was definitely a little confused when I first walked in, but there was a staff member who came up to us and explained how the ordering works. You order your base udon (hot, cold, with broth, without broth, carbonara, etc) and wait for them to make your udon bowl. Once you get it, you move on to the tempura area where there's 8-10 different types of tempura (shrimp, pumpkin, chicken, fish cakes, etc). Each tempura is a different price which is demarcated above the respective tempura. Grab your tempura, onigiri, etc and make your way to the register.   I got the kamatama (udon, egg yolk, and the broth/sauce?) with scallions, ginger, shrimp tempura (2), and tempura fish cake. The udon was chewy and well cooked, and the yolk was a bright orange/yellow with a ton of flavor. The eggs really made the dish rich and added that extra dimension of flavor that made it stand out.  My favorite thing was the tempura. The batter is lightly salted, so you can actually taste the tempura. Some other places don't have a great batter so you end up with a flavorless crunch. Cafe Sanuki definitely did a great job with the tempura. It's crunchy, flavorful, and fresh!  With our Yelp check in, we got a free drink which is refillable. I got the peach tea and added some syrup sweetener from the drink area. It was pretty standard until I tried the lemonade. I'm a big fan of sweet lemonade that isn't overly sour/tart and Cafe Sanuki delivered. It's sweet but you can still taste the lemon behind all that sweetness.  Overall, it's a great udon joint that I really enjoy. It's slowly becoming my favorite udon place in Vegas. If you haven't already or are thinking of trying it out, don't hesitate and go check it out for yourself. Don't forget to check in on Yelp for a free drink!",

The Udons and the mini Miso Garlic pork belly bowl were satisfying. The onigiri, inari, and Pork bao were average. The bao needed Keupie mayo and cilantro to complement the entire sandwich.

    "text": "Advertised as an \"authentic, Japanese-style cafeteria\", I came to Cafe Sanuki's soft opening harboring some apprehension- cafeteria style food in the US doesn't exactly evoke positive opinions of quality eats. But the term seems to be referring exclusively to the fact that food is ordered, made, and received in a tray line. Staff were allegedly sent to Japan to learn the correct cooking techniques and the majority of cooking supplies from eggs to a particular brand of tofu are shipped in for authenticity.  I visited with friends and tried a variety of udon dishes, \"hand rolls\" (called onigiri elsewhere),tempura,  and don buri and the quality was solid. Noodles are long and chewy, with a carefully timed boil and weighed portions. The more traditional udon dishes seemed to fare better than the fusion options like carbonara and tomato-seafood. I am not typically a big fan of udon noodles but I enjoyed the meals I had here- the yaki udon dish in particular was huge and fresh, with a light and flavorful sauce that stuck well to the noodles and kept them from tasting plain. I will eventually have to try the bukkake dish too, for obvious reasons...  The miso-garlic pork belly bowl is a small portion that packs a punch of flavor. Others praised the beef bowl and curry options, but I'll have to go back for those. Their tempura station is cool but perhaps due to their new opening and slow line speeds, some of the received product was cold and/or soggy, so this may be an option better chosen when you can see it being put out hot and fresh. Also of note is their tea station, featuring several exclusive blends and a variety of flavored syrups to customize.",

    "text": "I went to the soft opening of this restaurant. When we got there the line was a bit long but that's usually a good  sign.  After about a 20 min wait we were next to order. It's kind of like the cafeteria style where you wait in line, place your order and they give you a number. Then you continue in the line where you can pick sides of tempura or  onigiri. I ordered the carbonara and a mini curry, as well as a shrimp tempura and a ball of mixed veggie tempura.   Pros: 3 out of 4 of our dishes came out pretty fast. Food was hot and was pretty good. Carbonara was saucy but a little plain. Literally just noodles and sauce.  The onigiri was pretty good. The tempura was nothing fancy. Prefer to skip out on it next time.   Cons: (I understand this was a soft opening so I am still leaving four stars) our fourth dish (clam udon) did not come out for 20 min. We waited and waited and saw many others that had ordered after us get their clam udon. We waved down multiple servers and told them but they would brush it off without even checking that \"it's coming\" \"it takes a while\"  The rest of us all finished our meal and our fourth person still did not receive her udon. I work in a restaurant too and I know and understand that when it's busy, we all make mistakes and forget orders, or something happens in the kitchen. Just an honest \"let me go check for you, their might have been a mistake or forgot to put the order in I'm sorry\" would make everything so much better. 25 min later we finally got the clam udon.  If you plan on ordering the clam udon, be prepared to wait!!   Also, they have one fountain drink machine in the whole place. It's not the regular ones with all the diff sodas you can pour from, but the single serving touch screen ones where only one person can pour from at a time.  I understand that soft openings are good because they hear about customers Inputs and change and fix things up! So here is my soft opening input!",

From the food display when you first walk in, to the menus, business cards, and decor, the attention to detail and desire for authenticity is apparent at every level. And then there's the food! Every item we ate, the udon, tempura, beef bowl, and of course the TAIYAKI! Everything was delicious, and it felt like we took a short trip to Japan for just an hour or two! Can't wait to see Cafe Sanuki succeed and grow! We plan to be part of the journey!!",

    "text": "Disclaimer: I would rate this place 5 stars for service alone. For food review, read on. ;)  Came here this evening with my wife and 2 year old son. We were warmly greeted by an exceptionally nice young lady named Jasmine (sorry if I spelled her name wrong) who gave us great recommendations. The staff at the order counter were personable and fun. After paying, Jasmine helped carry one of our trays to our table since my wife was carrying our son. She cleared the trays, and proceeded to check back with us regularly throughout our dinner. The food was very good- I got a Katsu which was HUGE and my wife got an udon she really enjoyed! The food I would give a 4/5, keeping in mind that this is a cafeteria style place- it's not a 5 Star restaurant so ratings need to adjust accordingly, right? At one point I needed to go get a drink for my Son, and they had a long line, so I asked if I could just grab a drink cup, and come back and pay for it later. Jasmine handed me a drink cup, and said not to worry about it. That seems like a very little thing, right? Its hard sometimes explaining exactly what makes exceptional service exceptional- it can be a bit intangible, you know? I've had waiters do everything right and still be subpar because they were clearly going through the motions- I think the service here is a step above because it's WARM. Like, the staff actually care about being nice, and they are very genuine. So I guess I could talk about their thoughtfulness and attention to detail too, but it ultimately comes down to actually caring, which they do.   We will definitely come back here, and probably would even come back if we were less impressed with the food. Management, if you read this, make Jasmine a manager or give her a store, whatever. You can train people really well, but you can't train authenticity- a person has it, or they don't. Your staff has it, and I was happier with Jasmine than I have been with waiters in many 5-Star restaurants.",

Loaded with seafood (shrimp, squid, mussels, & white fish) in a delicious creamy sauce. Large portion. *****  Nabiaki Udon...  Great mixture of flavors, a little bit of everything including an egg, shrimp tempura, beef, radish, greens and noodles in a killer yummy broth. Enough for 2! *****  Curry Beef Udon... Large portion with a nice zip of spice. I only had a quick taste, so I can only add that my daughter is looking forward to going back! *****  Miso Garlic Pork Belly Mini Rice Bowl...  Spectacular!  The sauce kind of infused itself into the rice, turning good white rice into something special. *****  Beef Mini Rice Bowl... Very good, not great. Enjoyed the beef more in the Nabiaki Udon than in the rice bowl. ****  All of this, plus 3 three drinks and a potato tempura, for $43  And to top it all off, the staff was incredibly nice and helpful. The display was beautiful and was a very good (and precise) visual aid!  We will be back.... Soon!",

So once you walk through the door, you will pick up a tray and then walk down the line and order what ramen you would like. I got the Niku ramen which is #3 and it was pretty tasty. The soup was not too salty and not too bland, it was just the right amount of flavor you would expect in a broth. Their noodles were the perfect texture. You could also pick up tempuras as your side dish so I picked up a few shrimp tempuras and my friend got a chicken karaage skewer which were all amazing! If you check in, you get a free drink and they have unlimited calpico!!!! The seating here was great because the tables aren't too close together so it felt roomy. I'll definitely be back to try other things on their menu.",

Looking forward to eating the yummy looking udon noodles, tempura and enjoying the unique teas and drinks they serve.   So...we just got done. It was an experience. Self served cafeteria style. It was fun! Food were easy to order and fresh and the prices were surprisingly affordable! Approx $5-$8 an item. Tempura was by the item for $1.75 each and they were good sizes. The noodles were definitely yummy gummy and fresh. I do recommend the pork belly rice bowl and the curry pork cutlet bowl with rice or noodles",

Definitely better to show up after 7pm if you enjoy a more quite/relaxed meal, anytime I've been any earlier it's been pretty crazy and loud. I've tried multiple things on their menu and have enjoyed everything and the staff is always super friendly. If you're looking for more authentic Japanese food/environment I definitely recommend going!",

I'm not known to be an udon fan but I do enjoy their noodles here!   Tempura- They're best when fresh out of the fryer, unfortunately you may not know if they're unless you see them refilling them. Note that the tempura sauce is located where the utensils and water is. A worker also informed me that you can ask for their katsu sauce to go with your tempura as well, thanks for the tip!   Carbonara- creamy and cheesey. This was good, but I wasn't a fan of the pork. The pork wasn't that tender and it had an off taste. I personally wouldn't order this again because of the pork, otherwise the dish is fine and was recommended by an employee.   Niku- beef broth soup topped with thin sliced beef, onions and green onions. It had a good beef flavor. Tip from employee, we can ask for a side of the beef broth with any order and this broth is the same for the other beef based soups.",

That being said the food was not as good as I'd hoped.  The Yaki udon did not have that much flavor across the board, maybe just a bad pick by me. The curry udon had good flavor in the sauce, but it did not stick to the noodles very well - thats not bad but it was more like a soup.  They had plenty of tempura options, but were all made ahead of time and were just sitting out - they were cold and no longer crispy by the time you got to eat them. Value was pretty good however, meal for 2 under 20 bucks and free drink with a yelp checkin. Probably not a repeat destination tho. 3/5",

The option was good. We wish there were smaller portions for the noodles so we could try different noodle dishes. They have small portions for the rice dish but not the noodles. The only things I would encourage the owner to improve are the heat of the broth. The soup got cold real quick as soon as we sat down. The tempura was good and crunchy, but the fried chicken was a bit bland. The tea and yogurt drink was not great but I'm glad they have the other drink options. Price was good. I would come back again but it would be great if they could at least improve the temperature of the dishes.",

The Udon noodles are excellent and the pork belly boa, Udon beef bowl, I can go on and on we had to try almost everything. I will tell we did not have one bad dish, everything was amazing we are so full. If you love Japanese food or have never tried it this is the place to come. You love not be disappointed.",

    "text": "At the first hint that I was feeling better I decided to get some soup to help, but instead of Pho or Matzo Ball, I decided to go Japanese and ventured over to a relatively new place, Cafe Sanuki located at Decatur and Spring Mountain in the space that was formerly \"The End\" bar.  WoW! What a TREASURE!  You know it's good when there's Japanese people eating there, yet it's VERY \"American Friendly\" which is something that most Asian restaurants aren't.  What I mean is that you'll feel very comfortable ordering food here even if you have no clue about Japanese food. When you walk in there's a huge glass display featuring replicas of their most popular products. There are also well crafted booklets available which show and explain each item. There's also video monitors that show the various offerings as well.  You won't have to 'guess' what each item is. It's very well shown and explained.  Their specialty is Udon, which is a soup featuring thick noodles. There are many varieties, mixed with different items such as veggies, eggs, and meat. Rice bowls are also a tempting offering, and there are sides including, but not limited to various tempura and seaweed wraps ('sushi'... sort of).  It's served cafeteria style, meaning you line up with a tray and order. After paying you bring your food to a table.  They also have an outstanding selection of soft drinks including an unusual one called Calipo. If you're adventurous but don't like the idea of ordering a drink that you don't know if you'll like, this is a great place to try it out because the drinks are bottomless and self serve. Free drink with Yelp check in, too!  Fantastic, authentic Japanese food at a low, low price! (Kake Udon, 2 Tempuras, and a beverage for under $10)",

Employees greeted us warmly and said it won't be open for another ten minutes but was welcome to sit and wait. While we sat there we was offered a drink. How nice of the employees to do that especially for a self serve kind of restaurant. Basically you just pick the entree and it serves fresh and you can add any additional sides. This reminds me of a place in Wakiki called Marukame Udon in Honolulu. That place is sooo so good!! Service here is better tho :).",

The tempura was great, we had the chicken, squid, asparagus, sweet potato. The only tempura that wasn't the greatest was the chicken, is was to greasy for our liking and it had chucks of sticky fat inside. The squid tempura made up for this though, it was so tender and tasty. The drinks were okay, the soda fountain was a big hit with the kids as were the bendy straws, the teas were not good to us they were to strong like drinking astringent, the Japanese yogurt drink was good and light. I think my only over all complaint is the cleanliness of the place, it is very clean to an extent but the floors were extremely sticky, it took the shoe of my family members foot, the trays were sticky as well and not cleaned properly. Over all I do recommend this place, just take some hand sanitizer and get the squid not the chicken!",

I ordered number 4 and number 11 with my girlfriend. The raw egg in number 4 was so different. It was probably the best egg I've ever tasted. The owner told me it was actually shipped from Japan. Blending it with udon was a totally new experience, and I liked it a lot. Number 11 had the freshest seafood. It had shrimps, squids, fish, and oyster, and it was only $9. Totally worth it! I also tried their tempura. The shrimp tempura and sweet potato tempura were my favorite. This restaurant really changed how I think of udon. It would be a restaurant that I will highly recommend to friends and family.",

    "text": "I was in Las Vegas for job training and had a taste for noodles. Hopped on Yelp to find a good noodle place to try. Since Cafe Sanuki was highly rated with positive reviews, I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did!!! I walked in and right away was impressed by the decor of the restaurant. It has a modern and trendy look, yet is simplistic and a welcoming feel to it. I felt very welcomed and comfortable in the restaurant's ambience. The place is very clean and the staff are very friendly and helpful. The restaurant is great for a large group of friends/family or a lone diner such as myself.  There were so many menu items I wanted to try! But alas, I was dining alone and couldn't order too many items. This is when I wished I had my family/friends with me, that way we all could order different items to share and taste. Oh well:( I got the Nabiaki Udon! My reaction to the first sip of the broth...HOLY COW THIS IS GOOD STUFF!!! The broth was light but very flavorful and not at all greasy. The udon noodle was also fantastic! The udon was fresh and homemade from scratch on site. You can see how they make the noodles through a glass frame. I thought that was pretty interesting. The udon had great texture to it, tasted very fresh, and was not soggy. I have been to many noodle shops before and many of them had noodles that just sat in the boiling water for too long and became soggy. Not at Cafe Sanuki! The items that came with Nabiaki Udon complemented it very well. The slices of meat were very tender, tasty and almost just melt in your mouth. The fish cake was chewy. The egg was perfectly cooked and the yolk just oozes, exactly how I like my eggs! I ordered extra shrimp tempura so I can dip it in the broth, ahh so good!  Now for the drinks, I had their house blend lemonade. I saw many Yelpers' reviews on it so I had to try it for myself. Wow! Again, GOOD STUFF!!! It was very refreshing especially in the Vegas heat. This lemonade was thicker than your traditional lemonade. It had like a creamy taste/feel to it. Not sure what they put in it to make it creamy. The lemonade was sweet, tangy and creamy all at the same time. It was delicious!  The price of the menu items are all very reasonable...some might even say cheap. All of the goodness at very reasonable prices make Cafe Sanuki a must try destination, whether you're a local or out of towner! I already know the next few items I'm going to try at Cafe Sanuki the next time I'm in Vegas. The Spicy Miso Pork and pork belly bao all being washed down with an ice cold cup of Calpico!!!",

I'm always down for some vegetable tempura. The lemonade was also interesting and was a milk type base that I enjoyed. I would try again!",

Needless to say, I was pleased to see that great range of food items, ranging from more traditional items, to several contemporary options for noodle bowls, rice bowls, and other sides and the like.  They are extremely efficient when it comes to rice bowls, if you don't want to wait that long for your food. From what I've observed, they take the time to make sure that they are making a high quality product for their customers!  Now, I've done the tea bar, along with the Calpico...needless to say, I probably drank a lot of Calpico...probably way too much. Their beverage options are wonderful, and they truly make sure to keep their utensils and the like organized.   The kitchen, from what I've seen, runs in a very clean manner, and members of their crew make sure to keep the restaurant as clean as they possibly can, even when a rush hits them!   I can now add this place to the very short list of restaurants that I eat at in Las Vegas!",

So there is a buffet style set up, you would think that you can get the noodles then grab whatever tempura you want then pay and go grab a table. But not, you get the noodles, then you tell the guy which tempura you want then you can either stay there and wait for it or they will bring it to you. They do not have a numbering system so the staff walked around with the food asking table by table if the food is theirs...why have the buffet set up if you have to order then wait for the food anyways?  The food is not bad but extremely overpriced for what it is. My brother got the large garlic pork belly bowl and it was so small, just rice and the meat...which didn't even look like pork belly, it looked like teriyaki beef.   The udon on its own is about $6 which is not bad at all but the tempura were ridiculously overpriced. $1.50 or 1 piece of sweet potato or pumpkin, $1.75 for a pretty small shrimp. Neither the udon or the broth were special enough that I have to come back.   Not a fan of the concept or the price, the food was average, don't see myself coming back.",

The noodles weren't the extra thick udon noodles that we're normally accustomed to in the States.  They were more the thinner but still chewy consistency noodles that you would get in Japan.  The broth was flavorful.  Also added the pork belly rice bowl for only $2.95!    Tips: - the pork belly buns only available during dinner - skip the soda machine and give the Calpico (yogurt drink) and house lemonade (slightly creamy) a try! - tempura and hand tools are a la carte at the end of line...got my spam masubi fix - sounds silly but their straws are cool!",

Once you have reviewed that then you can start getting in line and ordering your food. Towards the end of the line you can add side dishes to your meal. They offered tempura (vegetable and shrimp), rice rolls, chicken, and oden  I had the Carbonara Udon and it was delicious. The noodles were thick and the sauce was amazing. The pork meat that was included with the Udon was very tender and soft and it went very well with the dish. I also got a side of the shrimp tempura, which was great (not too oily and still crispy)  The staff were all incredibly friendly and helpful as well. I will definitely come back soon so that I can try their other dishes.",

    "text": "Have to say I am the last person to ever write a review especially for an udon spot (super picky when it comes to noodles).   This is cafeteria style. You first order what noodle dish you would like. Both times i had gotten #1 kake udon. A small side of the pork belly rice. While waiting for my udon and rice i had to slide right through to the tempura. The udon is soooo flavorful, super long and cooked just right where it's not to chewy and not not chewy. The broth is comforting. The pork belly is cooked well enough where it's tender not chewy you can tell this place really cares for The quality of product they carry.  I knew i was going to get the small side of pork belly ehh i didn't want any meat in my udon but if i wasn't going to get the side of rice i would've ended up with Kamamata udon.                                     THE SIDES  Tempura: Pumpkin Potato  Shrimp  Zucchini  Most importantly the SOFT EGG  They also have chicken karage  And rice balls stuffed with yumminess on the inside  wrapped with crunchy seaweed on the outside.   Onigiri They have six different flavors ^^  And to wash down all the dry stuff because you slurped all your udon and broth in the first 30 seconds of sitting down they have \"drum roll\" CALPICO on tap. That is Asian childhood heaven. Never in my life would i have ever thought some bloody owner of anywhere would be so generous. (Refillable) Thank you   Desert say no more  TAIYAKI   Last but not least            CUSTOMER SERVICE  Was so impeccably helpful and honestly you can tell their crew are good people. They don't hate they life's. Super helpful their attitudes aren't fake.  I'm pretty sure it was mostly the humble helpful service i received from the two girls that made me come back the next day or was it i ran out of the 6 Onigiri i had to help me get through the rest of my day.   I know i rambled but super happy i found an awesome spot that doesn't have trash service and trash food. Finding food that actually has flavor and quality is making me miss home a little more less ^^",

My boyfriend and I walk in and at first glance, they have a wax food display of their menu. You make a right and the lines starts there. There was a hostess kind enough to guide us to the ordering window. Everyone there was very kind and helpful.   We ordered Niku Udon and a curry katsu. We waited for our order. Meanwhile I started grabbing some shrimp tempura, sweet potato tempura and a salmon onigiri. We also got a lemonade.   PS free drink with a yelp check in   Anyways the food was delicious and good sized portions. The lemonade was amazing. It was creamy, not too sour but not too sweet. I definitely went back for refills.   I think the only thing was that it started off a little rocky because we didn't understand how the ordering process worked but we slowly got it. Either than that, I'm definitely coming back again. Love the concept, food and service.",

There is ample parking and a good sized dining room to accommodate solo diners to larger groups of party revelers.   Today I had the beef bowl and sides of shrimp & vege tempura.

The staff was very friendly and helpful when we were trying to order our food. They make it fresh to order and you can order fresh tempura also.  They have a add-on option when you order a bowl or udon you can double the size of it for a small charge and or add a small rice bowl noodle from chicken and eggs, to beef, and pork belly miso.  The miso broth is amazing and flavorful. I got the mentai udon which was a creamy lightly salty, with some fish in it. But had so much flavor   Calpico is unlimited and they have a drink station that you can pump on your own flavors like mango, strawberry's ect. Amazing place and the decor inside is very warm and inviting. I will be visiting this place more and more.",

There's a display case of everything on the menu upon entering. The menu also has pictures of the food so it makes it easier to know what to expect. I ordered the kitsune udon and my friend ordered the carbonara udon. The udon was fresh! The kitsune broth was just right, not too sweet or too salty. The carbonara was yummy - it came in a huge bowl. The chicken karaage was flavorful, the chicken to batter ratio was just right. My friend also ordered salmon roll and shrimp tempura but at this point, my friend and I was too full to eat them. So they were put in a to-go container. The food was great, service was awesome, and the price was right! Will be back here with my family again.",

The story behind how the owner wanted to deliver the Japanese food to American people was very inspiring.

There food just as amazing as their inspiring story. We shared a bunch of different dishes so you get an idea of what you like and vice verse. I ordered the beef curry udon.

I took my cousin here and my husband had told me its cafeteria style. When you walk in there's a glass display of all their dishes in realistic form. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water! From the models, you know exactly what you are getting.   There was a line when we got there but it went fairly quickly. We ordered and went through the line. I was a bit disappointed that the tempura section was lacking. They didn't restock the items that were missing and the tempura that was left looked old. The onigri had a good selection too. We paid and I forgot to use my free drink when I checked in.   The Udon comes out later since the make each order individually. The verdict...it was good. The noodles were a bit over cooked but I definitely preferred the tempura Udon over the tomato seafood Udon that we had gotten which the noodles were definitely over cooked. It's def big enough to bring kids (because that's something that I look for now) and noisy enough that having kids there won't ruin the ambiance.   Overall, I like it and wished they had a place closer to the southwest. ;) service was great and I know I will be back.",

The reason for the 3 star mainly comes from the fact that the noodles don't have as bouncy a mouthfeel compared to the ones from the other udon honpos we have been to. The broth was very light as well.   The curry has a slight sweetness/umami to it what we couldn't figure out. It almosts tastes like Parmesan cheese was added it. It ended up to be a little sweet for my taste. The katsu was good.   I also enjoyed the temple which was light and nicely fried.  Will certainly keep this place for udon.",

I'd probably get the nabeyaki udon next time as the niku was a bit too sweet in the soup. Bao has too much cabbage and hubby said onigiri was just \"ok\".   What is the hype with this lemonade? I thought it was gross. It was like a milky lemonade. Like Calpico - which when I was a kid was named Calupis and we called it \"cow piss\" and couldn't stop laughing every time we saw a commercial. No wonder they changed the name.   Service: order noodles at the counter, then scoot down the line and grab individual tempura items or onigiri and then pay. They accept credit card. Self service drinks (got a free lemonade with Yelp check-in). They will bring your noodles to you when ready. Everyone was friendly. I was annoyed that they were all out of ume onigiri.   Ambiance: straight up copy cat of the udon place Marukame Udon in Waikiki (of course Hawaii is way better because the noodles are hand-pulled there and here is a machine), but these were good texture and not mushy like some other reviews.   Location: same plaza as Gyu-kaku Japanese BBQ off Spring Mountain.",

The lines were much improved compared to their soft opening days but they still ran out of eggs ! (well for the tempura anyway... at least I still got one in my nabeyaki at least)  This event was to promote a few of their new items  Nabeyaki Udon - Hot udon noodle soup cooked and served in individual iron pot. Special kake based soup filled with seasoned beef, mushrooms, and cabbage topped with fishcake, shrimp tempura, and a Japanese poached egg.   Miso Sesame Pork over Rice - Sauce made from blend of 6 difference sauces and 2 types of chilis  Garlic Chicken Udon Salad - Iceberg Lettuce Salad Mix, Cucumbers, Radish, Cherry Tomatoes on a bed of freshly made udon topped w/ special seasoned fried chicken karaage served with a sweet soy garlic dressing  Mentaiko Ochazuke Rice - Pour salted dashi broth over a bed of white rice and fragrant crispy rice topped with Mentaiko on a bed of scallions  Shabu Shabu Udon Salad - Fresh Spring Salad Mix and bell peppers on a bed of freshly made udon topped with thin sliced pork belly, cherry tomatoes, and served with a sweet miso sesame dressing  Of course we had to try the new Nabeyaki Udon, and I've always wanted to try ochazuke rice bowls.   The nabeyaki udon serving is really big. I'm not sure if it was because I was currently going through a bout of a stomach bug (most likely cuz I know im more of a piggy than this normally...) Lots of veggies. Only complaint was the broth was a bit sweet. I don't know if their \"special kake based soup\" is originally sweet but I know the beef is cooked in a sweet base too. Questioned if it was my appetite but others agreed to the sweetness as well. I still wonder if I can request the udon to be cooked less. I keep forgetting about this until I eat the udon. Lol The poached egg was yummy. Super silky and creamy yolk.   Mentaiko Ochazuke Rice... wait I was supposed to get salted dashi broth? o well. I over ordered anyway and couldn't even eat this, nor the mentai onigiri I had gotten as well. LOL sad face. I ended up moving the mentai over to the mentai cream pasta which was shared between the few of us.   The mentai onigiri (which I ate the next morning) was fairly decent. The mentai is actually more spread throughout the onigiri than ones I've had in the past at other places which gives more of a spread mentai experience vs all in the middle. pretty good :]",

It's the type where you get in line and order your udon and extras.  Tempura is grab yourself style.    I always default to the cold udon because I love how chewy the cold noodles are.  Usually it is hard for udon to stay chewy in the hot broth.  The onsen  egg is also perfectly cooked.    They also have some different options that include a Chinese dish that is like Zha jiang noodles but with udon.  It was quite delicious and had a lot of good sesame flavor.  They also have beef bowls which are gooood as well.    Check in for a free drink!  Calpico fountain!!! What.",

Cafe Sanuki, located in the city that never sleeps, has definitely created one of the most elevated Udon noodles around.   Excellent characteristics and bite on the Udon noodles with a broth that's subtle in earthy flavors, yet it's effectiveness lingers with each slurp.   Cafe Sanuki also offers Pork Belly Bao; delicate pork belly pieces inside a soft, steamed bun, with in house made slaw. It was simple and not clouded with unnatural flavors.  Tempura, rice rolls are also offered as a part of their \"Munchies\" menu and don't forget to order Oden ( fish cake, radish, Konjac or egg) as an addition to your Udon.   No need to be dressed to the nines for something so impressive doesn't need white table cloths. Cafe Sanuki is pure, simple dining.   \"Itadakimasu\".",

I always come her and ordered the seafood tomato cream udon. It is my FAVORITE dish here. The price is good for its portion as well. I gave it a 4 star because I have tried other dishes and also the one incident where the karaage was raw. The dan dan noodle and the shoyu udon was ok. It is definitely not the best but it is good for its price. The rice curry dish was definitely my least favorite because of the sourness of the dish. I'm not sure if that's how it supposed to taste like but I would not recommend it. Beside all that, the staff is nice and friendly. If you do give this place a shot, try the seafood tomato cream udon! :)",

What's really nice about this place is that its main focus is udon dishes from traditional soup based to modern spinoffs (such as carbonara); it's a very casual establishment where you order in almost a cafeteria-style fashion, falling in line and going straight to the register, picking up some extra pre-made appetizers along the way. There's lots to choose from on the menu with each dish costing around $8-10, with generous portions that would satisfy even the hungriest of customers. The noodles are freshly made and the difference in quality can be tasted! I've tried the cheesy carbonara and the mentai cream (a fish roe based cream sauce) and they were both delicious and satisfying! Another nice thing is that they have an array of not your run of the mill drinks, such as calpico, their specialty lemonade (a creamier mouthfeel), and a variety of brewed flavored teas. Overall I loved this place and would highly suggest it!",

Grab a tray and start your journey :)  I ordered the Mentai noodles and the boyfie order the #1. Both were really, really good flavor wise, but the noodles were a bit too soft. Fresh udon noodles should be a little chewy like Oodle Noodle's! Still, it was really good. The shrimp and squid tempura were amongst the best I've ever had (including Japan). The onigiri's are packed with fish so it's the perfect fish/rice ratio.   Super inexpensive and a good meal. Definitely will be back!",

    "text": "Cafe Sanuki really threw me off with its ordering system. Honestly it was just awkward and a mess to me. No one wants to stand in line when they go out to eat. They do advertise as cafeteria style but I feel like it's a huge disservice to their staff for tipping and their customers.  Anyways! My favorite udon place closed down.. Monson. Tear . And Sanuki has a similar menu. The food here is like a 6.5 out of 10 to me. Just at the right level to warrant eating out because you can't make it at home conveniently.   They have a digital menu while you wait of mostly udon dishes and a couple of rice dishes. They also have some appetizers like their bao buns and their tempura station which is already made and a la carte.   I love how they have a couple traditional Italian pasta dishes that they Japanese udon-ified like the carbonara and the seafood dish. The seafood dish had a decent amount of seafood for the price. I also really liked their curry bowl.  I had no idea the service style was like this and it's actually a lot of back and forth between the customer and the staff. Some things you order and take right away while other things get brought out to you or you go pick up.  With that aside the food is actually pretty tasty and satisfying. I couldn't give them a higher rating because nothing really warrants it. The service was nothing special and the food although solid for a casual dining place it is not anything I crave and nothing was a stand out.",

Granted, there are a lot of Westernized dishes (udon carbonara?) but overall I was quite impressed.  Just part the plastic menu items, you order noodles or rice dishes and then pick up various tempura vegetables and meats and then pay at the end of the line.  I had the tonkotsu shoyu udon, it was delicious. The meat was smoky and well cooked, the broth not too salty and very flavorful. Noodles were cooked well and not soggy or too chewy. Very good texture.  Also tried the shishito peppers, tempura shrimp and the chicken karaage. I enjoyed them all and appreciated that the staff cooked some chicken fresh. I also like that you can just grab them a la carte, and the prices were very reasonable.  To top it off, they've got Calpico drink, still not sure what it really is but made it feel much more authentic.   Definitely plan to return.",

    "text": "Cafe Sanuki was the best way I could have thought of ending my most recent Vegas trip. I had never heard of this cute little shop so I wasn't sure what to expect, but the photos had me salivating! I wasn't prepared for the entirety of its deliciousness.  I ordered the mentai cream udon while my guy ordered the carbonara udon (totally not because I kept saying how much I wanted both :^)). Both were deliciously creamy without giving me that heavy, overkill fatty feeling. The portions were also perfect. The mentai is definitely the lighter of the two, but I thought both of them were indescribably yummy and I highly recommend them. The miso pork belly bowl we added on to share was good, but nothing special and I probably wouldn't order it again. I would also pass on the onigiri as you can get these from any Japanese market for cheaper.   One of my favorite things about this place is the fact that, if you go onto yelp, you have the option to get 10% off your bill or check in for a free drink (unlimited refills at the self serve drink bar). I suggest getting the drink if you're dining in because it's soo worth it. They have original calpico in the dispensers so you can drink as much of this as your heart desires. They also have other cool drinks like homemade blood orange tea, as well as your typical soda machines. The best part is that they have flavored syrup pumps at your disposal if you're feeling adventurous and want to try mixing your own concoction.  As a tip for newbies like myself, Cafe Sanuki is cafeteria style. Upon walking in, you may be confused but the layout is pretty simple. Decide what you want and order with the cooks--while you wait for your meal, you have the option to pick up some tempura, etc from their hot bar. After this, you pay at the cashiers. That's it. Enjoy!!!",

This restaurant is so interesting and unique in that the way you order is cafeteria style where you get a tray and they serve you your udon at the counter. It was very cool to experience because I had never seen anything like that before and it makes me wonder if restaurants in Japan are like this?   The staff here is so friendly and made us feel very welcome. I want to come back to try other things!",

I would recommend not getting the mini rice bowl option unless you're sharing with another person or super hungry.  Definitely coming back to try more dishes.",

They have a large dining room which is great because at that time I came with a party of 8 people plus 2 babies (my twins) for my Auntie's birthday dinner.   I tried their kake udon which is basically traditional Japanese udon. Yes, I know I'm boring when I could've gotten something more interesting like Mentai Cream Udon... BUT I judge an udon place based on the original udon! I added just shrimp tempura and fish cake on top cos I believe those two + udon are a perfect trio to the palate! I was BLOWN AWAY at how delicious it was! It wasn't too salty or too much of anything. I literally could've gone for seconds if I didn't have my twins with me, lol. They also have all-you-can-drink CALPICO! Y'all... I love Calpico! It's supposedly good for you? Even if it that's not True, let me believe that it is anyway lol.   Anyway, I am definitely going to eat here more often and recommend this place to others! It's a definite MUST TRY udon place if you're ever around the area!",

We could've shared one item between the 2 of us.   The food here is not the highest quality japanese food you'd fine, but the value for what you get is excellent. We tried the curry udon, curry katsu (fried pork over rice) and soft boiled egg udon. I wouldn't recommend the egg udon as it was a cold udon but the currys were very tasty! get the katsu curry if you like or the curry udon if you like noodles. They're essentially the same thing",

Ambience- Reminds me of japan! Made me miss japan sooo much. The wooden furniture, lighting, and the way you choose your food. The way you choose your food is like at the train stations in japan! They even have the fake plastic foods that look exactly like their dishes!! So Cute. You get in line and pick and choose what you want and pay at the register.   Servers- The nicest servers I've ever met. They're so sweet and nice! They're honestly the best?!?!?! All so friendly and welcoming!  Food -  Absolutely delicious. Ordered the #11 - sauted sweet cream tomato udon, 8 shrimp tempura, 1 sweet potato tempura, 1 curry udon, 1 steak and rice plate, 2 kake udon, 1 tonkatsu udon, 1 takoyaki, 1 pork belly rice bowl, 2 pork buns, and 1 salmon onigiri all for $80ish dollars!!   Sweet cream tomato udon was the best. I shouldn't have worn a white shirt though don't use chopsticks when eating this dish! But it was delicious!! Better than spaghetti tbh. The udon noodles with the sauce is so good.  Curry, kake, & tonkatsu udon was good too!  The steak and rice plate threw my family off guard because there was gravy. They just thought it was just seared steak.   Tempura was good! Their tempura sauce is on the side near the beverages so you have to get it there. You can also sprinkle matcha salt into your tempura!! I love that so much! Definitely adds depth in flavor.   The pork belly bowl reminded me of yoshinoya beef bowl! Still good regardless.  The pork belly buns were big in portion and definitely worth my $$$.   Didn't get to eat the salmon onigiri yet bc we saved it as a snack for later...  You get free drinks when you check in on yelp!! They allow every person in your party check in and get a free drink even when you're paying all together!!   Will definitely come back in the future for their food esp the sweet cream tomato udon....",

You're greeted by plastic versions of all the entrees - just like in Japan, which is such a smart way to figure out your order. The patrons slurping their noodles and speaking Japanese in the dining area sealed the deal and we knew this place was legit! The atmosphere is classy fast casual, so you order at the counter and then take a seat in the hip dining room area lined with Japanese books and trinkets. They have a ton of tempura options to accompany your udon noodles - the fish cake and shrimp were both out of this world! I will be working my way through their tempura list now! I got the house udon (sesame and miso with ground pork) and it was so flavorful. Portions are large and I brought home enough for a second meal! Prices are totally reasonable too! We got two udon dishes and three tempuras and spent around $25. Cant wait to come back!!!",

    "text": "This is a nice restaurant setting but a little confusing when you walk in cause you don't see right away where you order. The noodles here are good and the noodle portion size is big. They advertise a deal to get a mini size of their rice bowls and we got the chicken curry katsu mini size. You'd expect to get some chicken katsu in it since it's a mini size right? Wrong, you don't get any chicken in it and have to pay $3 extra for chicken. Kind of deceiving if your picture has chicken katsu in it. When we asked the girl taking our order about it she got a little rude. So we ended up getting the chicken karaage from the side area instead and it was super cold. May or may not return again, slightly disappointing first experience.",

    "text": "I've been to Cafe Sanuki a number of times, having tried the different types of products they serve. The process of ordering food is that of a cafeteria, something I have not experienced since grade school. One can observe the menu, a majority of the selection being udon and rice dishes. The staff is there nicely help one along the process.  My first time actually here I had ordered the Carbonara udon, an absolutely filling bowl of white sauce udon. Still good though, but was just more than I could handle which fortunately justifies the price. My second go here I decided to try out the rice bowls, specifically the Braised House Pork Bowl. It was a lovely amalgamation of pork, egg, red radish, green onion, and rice. I had ordered the mini sized version which seemed to be the prefect size for myself. Lastly, my latest outing I had ordered something a bit unorthodox here, the Pork Belly Bao. The pork belly bao is my favorite thing here. It is both inexpensive and savory, the soft neutral bao bun works perfectly to enhance the flavor of the cooked pork belly. Every bite down to its last is just my personal little heaven. The drink selection I also would like to give a shout out. The house lemonade is uniquely different than typical lemonade, so much so that I would really recommend serving yourself some. Cafe Sanuki has become one my favorite spots in Spring Mtn., it being both an atypical restaurant/cafeteria hybrid, and just serving all-around great food with great service. Check it out!",

    "text": "Here is my doodle about the oodles of noodles :]  Before anything else, let me just say that this place straight up reminds me of Shirokiya in Hawaii. Every time I go back home to the islands, I always hit up that place that is located in Ala Moana Center. And now, a part of it has magically warped into Las Vegas!  As soon as you enter, you will see a display case of everything they have on the menu. It gives the names of all the menu items and little descriptions of what each one is. It is like a lil udon museum. So cheesy, I know. :p  Pricing is not bad at all and seems to be about the same as other places. Maybe even cheaper, but worth it. This gives you a chance to try other menu items, since the portions are not overwhelming.  The restaurant has a walk-up line where you order and pick up your food. Just like a cafeteria, you get a tray, order, and wait for your food to be prepared before making a final stop at the cash register to pay. After your main dishes are prepared, you will come across a small section of add-on items. Some of these items include a variety of tempura, chicken skewers, soft boiled eggs, and spam musubi. After all that, seating is your choice. This restaurant is pretty sizable and there are plenty of tables and chairs throughout.  Now for my fave menu items and recommendations. I have tried the Kitsune Udon, Seafood Tomato Cream, Mentai Cream Udon, and the Beef Rice. As for add-ons, I've tried the shrimp/squid tempura, chicken skewers, and spam musubi. I highly recommend the Mentai Cream Udon. It had just the right amount of flavor, wasn't too salty, and it was just delicious. The broth and noodles of the Kitsune was just as good, so I'm pretty sure the flavors of the rest would be too. There was nothing special about the Beef Rice, but it was a nice little add-on. Plus, you can order the rice dishes in mini or regular sized bowls. A great option when wanting to try several different menu items.  All in all, this place is really great to hit up when you want a quick and simple meal. Udon is comfort food and there's nothing more satisfying than a bowl of noodle soup when the craving for something hot and soothing is just too real. lol If you're in the area, make the stop! :]",

Love the calpico drink fountain and the lemonade was very much like the Japanese lemonade. Unfortunately, that's where it would stop.   My disappointment was the gyoza... what was in it?!?! It was the saltiest, flavorless and not good at all. I think my dad who's not a great cook makes better ones. And the fried chicken... not that good either. Our food has a specific flavor with some Variation. But when you eat something that makes you go, this is not Japanese. There's something wrong.   I do commend the owner for going to Japan and learning how to make our udon but maybe some work on the sides. It was pretty inedible. My little one didn't even like it and she loves gyoza.",

In addition to a display case featuring models of each dish, there are full-color printed menus and screens before you order. I tried the #7  ontama bukake. The udon is served warm with green onions, tempura crispies, and a poached egg. The concentrated broth is served on the side. You also get a small bowl of soup with it. It was a good dish that sticks to the basics. I tried a fried chicken skewer--it was well seasoned, but cold. I wish they made it to order.  The onogiri is wrapped so the seaweed doesn't come into contact with the rice until you open it, so the seaweed stays crispy. The konjack reminded me of sea cucumber--kind of a crunchy rubbery texture.  There is a TV, but it was not on and there was no music, so it was pretty quiet in there.  Unfortunately the tea station was out of order, but the Calpico and lemonade make a good mix. Their straws have a uniquely large bendy section, which is fun!",

The food... I thought it was pretty yummy. I loved their drink selections. I love that they have all you can drink calpico!!! I love the selection of fried food that you can add with your order. I'm just not sure about the service. It just felt so... lacking. Quite different from other Japanese restos I've eaten at. This kind of service is something I would expect in a local cafeteria joint... not something like this place.   Would I come back? Probably. But, just for a quick meal. I wouldn't go here for family gatherings, date, formal work lunch, etc. Think of it like a fast food place but with better food selection.",

    "text": "tl;dr: It's good, but you're definitely not coming here because you want the best. \"Comfort food with a slight twist.\" is the best description I can give you.  My theory is that eventually I'll post enough reviews where it justifies the amount of times I've checked in everywhere using Yelp (I doubt I'll get to that point, but a guy can try). Cafe Sanuki is a place that, in my mind, closest resembles what a Japanese cafeteria / diner would actually look like.   It's all mostly Japanese comfort food, with rice bowls, udon, noodles, curry, and your typical appetizers running through the menu. Don't let the vast list fool you; it's all comfort that's good to fill a stomach and make you glad you ate, but it's not going to blow your mind. The good thing about Cafe Sanuki is also what holds them back: their food is safe. You won't have a bad experience there, but the food won't blow your mind. Everything is (in my opinion) fairly priced, so it has that going for them.  So if you're looking for an amazing noodle bowl or curry, you're better off finding a place that specializes it, but if you're looking for a place to eat and want a positive experience then head over to Cafe Sanuki. The prices are fair and the food is safely enjoyable.  Their service is always top-notch, too. Can't beat good service.",

One thing I really liked was the replica dishes they have on display for you to see what the food looks like. They also have an open kitchen so you can see the udon noodles being made fresh. Cafe Sanuki claims to make the udon with the only Yamato Udon Noodle Maker (a $40,000 machine) on the west coast. The machine makes sure every noodle is made and cut to perfection. 100% natural ingredients and authentic Sanuki Broth are used.   Vegetarian Tomato Basil ($7.80) - The sauce with noodles had really good flavor and the mushrooms in the dish were delicious. This is the perfect dish for anyone who doesn't eat meat or fish.   Miso Garlic Pork Belly ($3.95 for mini size) - The pork belly had great flavor and I recommend it, but my rice was one big cold clump. I was hoping for some yummy garlicky juices to be on the rice.   Kamatama Udon ($6.45) - The udon noodles come in a bowl with freshly grated ginger and a raw egg yolk. You break the yolk and stir it in the noodles and then mix in the provided soy sauce and or condiments. I didn't expect to like this honestly and was really surprised at how much good flavor there was.   Beef Rice ($3.95 for mini size) - The beef had good flavor, but again with a cold clump of rice. Maybe they have got some kinks to work out on the rice bowls.   Niku ($7.45) - The beef, noodles and broth all had good flavor. I really liked the noodles here and this particular dish is perfect on a cold night.   They have a good variety of tempura and rice rolls. The fried zucchini is huge and delicious. For drinks they have a Freestyle Machine, fresh brewed fruit teas and their own special recipe blend lemonade. The prices and portions are fair. This place is definitely worth checking out.",

Not too soft, not too firm. Will definitely come back again!",

    "text": "*   As a native of Japan, I was looking forward to visiting this new Udon restaurant. Overall, they're serving pretty authentic Sanuki Udon, however my first impression was the soup is too cowardly. It should be served very hot and even the soup stock could be much lighter brown by using more Dashi and mirin.  That's how the authentic Sanuki Udon Soup used in Western Japan should be.  Also I thought the Cashier is the key for the entire operation. Although all of my order were serviced at each kitchen section within a minutes, I had to wait to check-out for 5 mins. It doesn't make sense as Udon restaurant to make customer wait for so long. We, as customers want to enjoy freshly made noodles and soup right away.  I'd like to visit there again to see how their operation made progress. When I visited there, kitchen staff were still in training, and it looked only a manager knows how each section runs in the kitchen. Obviously all cooks need more time for cross training in order to make them flexibly workable at any sections.  Especially Tempura deep fryer should be kept clean. I'm sure it's not that easy to maintain the deep fryer equipment as using lots of flour & oil.  However, if the restaurant firmly wants to keep the \"open kitchen concept\", each cook should stay on top on cleanness and maintaining equipments. I saw there're lots of rooms to grow the business in this town.  Therefore I appreciate the owner bringing in the beautiful Udon culture to this town.   1.  2. 5 3. ",

    "text": "As a college student, I am painfully aware of the intersection of price and flavor. Thankfully, Chinatown never fails to deliver cheap, filling food packed with flavor, and Sanuki is no exception. There's more than a dozen inventive styles of udon to try. I ate the curry udon, and though the broth was thin, the flavors held fast to the hand pulled noodles. The cafe operates in a lunch line, which limits the throughput of guests, but adds a casual atmosphere and lets you see what you're buying. Though Sanuki is a noodle bar, don't forget to pick up the tempura and onigiri. The chefs have a great understanding on how to fry something perfectly (without bumping up your cholesterol). The rice bowls are delightful, and the portion is large. The regular bowl is the size of an entree, and 8 bucks isn't bad for the quality. Make sure to check in to get a free drink. You'll definitely want to spend it on the delicious teas and lemonades. There's no desert, but you'll be stuffed to the gills and happy as a clam for a little under 20 bucks.",

    "text": "The food is not the issue why I'm writing this post and I'm always trying to give a new business slack - been here several times since opened.  Me & my daughters pretty much order the same thing each time we come here, of course with everyone picking on each other dishes.  The very last time we came here, we walked in a little after 5:00 p.m. and we saw other customers with menus sitting down so we thought they were opened and we stood at the front for a few minutes wondering why no one acknowledged us as they were workers all around and normally we're greeted at the front door which is not a big deal if they did or not, we just decided to go over to the side where we order, noticed the menu boards were off so we grab our trays and walked over to the person that takes our order, and quickly my daughter saw the asian worker kissing one of the workers there, then the guys who was kissing the co-worker was a bit confused for a moment as we were trying to order, another worker who was filling the drinks came over and said to us they were closed, they don't open until 5:30 pm, so we decided to wait and as we sat there as I watched this worker refill the drinks I saw country time lemonade powder and thought don't they claim they have homemade lemonades and checked and it says houseblend.  Oh boy.  When it finally hit 5:30 pm we ordered quite a bit however we noticed that there was a special that said if we ordered any Udon soup we can order a mini rice bowl for $3.99, so we orded this to, however when we said we would like to get the Teriyaki steak, we were told that there were only three options we could get this special for, I asked why we couldn't get this, was advised because Teriyaki Steak already came with rice, this explanation was so confusing because all the requirements to get a mini bowl was to order an Undo, now understand this, we ordered Nabiaki Udon, Spicy Tan Tan, Mentai Cream, and Yes a regular Teriaki Steak, along with a squid and sweet potatoe tempura, tuna mayo and spam rice roll, 2 orders of dumplings which I asked if they had anymore as there weren't any out, was advised they cook to order which took awhile and felt they were items we could have ate while waiting for our main meal instead they were brought out to us when our meals were done, well with all this being said I'm sure I may come back just not now because for me when I eat out I would like to just have a nice comfortable experience, unfortunately I was truly discouraged, I may return at a later time, this us not to discourage anyone as the food is decent and I really like the Mentai Cream, posting in hopes they take a look at some of what I dealt with and maybe change a few things.",

Food is so tasty! I ordered #2, pork belly bao, and mother ordered the clam udon bowl. Portions are plenty for its pricing, just sucks we couldn't take our leftovers since we had plans afterwards.  Staff is incredibly sweet and energetic, very welcoming from the moment we entered. Though there is no waiter service, one of the cooks still checked up on our table to see if everything was good. From my observance of about 8 or so small walk-ins that night, staff ran orders out quickly, cashier (young lady) was super sweet & helpful, and customers left happy.  The inside decor is simple, yet so dynamic because of the awesome lamps! Plenty of seating as well.   One minor issue is the beeping of the buzzers they hand you for your food. If there are a lot of parties, beepings go off when food is ready for pick up. Again, minor issue (plus they had Seinfeld on TV so who cares).  Other than that- PLEASANT experience and am extremely happy I found this place to be part of our Vegas stay. Will come back when I can!",

That said, the service is very friendly and once they get into a groove and hit their stride, things will be a little faster and more efficient.   The udon here is on point. Period. I had a nice soft boiled egg that was perfectly cooked.  I'd come back anytime and have udon any day.   The tempura suffered from temperature issues but was beautifully cooked. I'm sure this will change as well as they get used to their service volume and turnover on tempura.   I also had a mini beef rice bowl (gyu-don) that was really good. Now that Las Vegas no longer has a Yoshinoya, this could be a great replacement.  The atmosphere is really cool and inviting. They made great use of the space and are able to accommodate quite a few people. The J-pop playing in the restaurant is a nice touch.   I'm definitely coming back.

    "text": "I like the fact that I was completely taken back by how the restaurant actually works. At first I thought it was your regular seating by number but then the staff quickly taught me how everything works. Regular cafeteria style where you order your stuff at the counter and then pay for it. Normally I would only see this type of service through Filipino restaurants but this was a first for me with a Japanese restaurant.   As you step in the door you get greeted by their menu. They have plastic(or I do hope its plastic) versions of what they have on their menu so you can gauge just how much the servings are per dish. I've seen these types of menu showings with plenty of japanese restaurants and I think its awesome. Because most of the time you're wondering how big the servings are for each entree. This completely eliminates that question. All you have to do is pick and choose then order.   At first I looked completely clueless as I did not know what to order. I wanted a regular udon bowl with broth but didn't know what the name was. The girl who took my order ended up giving me the Chef's Special which was udon covered in chili. It totally reminds me of Zha Zhiang Mien or Jajjangmyeon which is okay but I really wanted the broth one. Which was Kake Udon when I got a chance to actually look at their menu. Completely my mistake. I didn't tell them what I wanted I just kind of spewed a word and the girl tried her best to guess what it was.   Then I ordered a rice bowl which was also confusing to the staff because they apparently have two types of pork belly bowls, the Garlic Miso, and the Braised bowl. The cashier was totally helpful with confirming what I wanted which I did get but the staff kinda judged that since I got the huge bowl of Udon that I would've settled for a mini rice bowl instead of a regular sized one. Which was okay too. I wanted a regular sized one but I guess it worked out in the end because I had room for tempura and karaage(if this doesn't tell you I'm a fatass then yes I like eating a lot).   After the whole confusion ordering what I wanted I quickly turned my eye towards the tempura section. I immediately grabbed what's left of the fish cake tempura. They were also cranking out fresh chicken karaage at that time and I just couldn't resist. I wanted the rice balls but apparently their all fresh out of it. Which tells me I need to go here as they open. Not during the middle of the day.   After all that then you get to the drinks station. They have the fancier soda machine with the touch screen but I'm not about sodas. They do have other drinks like lemonades and flavored iced teas but my go to was the chilled yogurt drink called Calpico. Pretty straightforward, get your drinks, your utensils and off to the races.   The food was good. I have no recollection or base of what good Udon is but I have to say it was pretty tasty. The Chef's special indeed tasted like Zha Zhiang Mien which was a mystery at first but the. i found out that the owner was Chinese(or at least he had a Chinese name pardon my rudeness if I assumed wrong) and it kinda made sense then and there. The Miso Pork belly was so good. I came back another day to try the Braised Pork Belly but the Miso Pork Belly is where its at. I haven't tried their Gyudon but this won't be the last time I'm visiting these guys.   The tempura. Well I can't eat shrimp but the fish cake version I had was good too. Its not a fancy restaurant so I'm not expecing anything to blow my mind but the fish cake tempuras were exactly how I imagined it to be. The chicken Karaage was kinda dry though. I was expecting a little juiciness in them but I really can't complain about it. Just wish they had an option to have a dipping sauce with a mayo base for it just to cut the dryness of the meat.   Service wise, even if it was a cafeteria style place the cooks and the rest of the staff still ask how your food is and some even carry out conversations with you. I like that they are friendly and all but I mainly just stick to my food and eat. The cleaning part is usually you the customer bringing your tray to the collecting station. They have bins to put your dishes in but the staff urges they help youinstead of you doing it. Which is cool too.   Overall I would say I really like the feel of the place. I might end up going back a few more times to try out everything on the menu. But I'm already starting to have favorites. Rest assured this won't be the last time you see me there.   On a side note though I was able to try their rice balls or onigiri when I came back a later time but my take on it is it had way too much rice versus filling. It was still good but expected more filling. Not bad but it coild use improvement.",

Nice little change from the Katsu Curry that we're used to. The noodles were thick and tender and the flavor of the curry was enjoyable.  The Pork dish was a little disappointing. I was expecting decent pieces of Pork but instead it was maybe 6 pieces of glorified bacon.  The tempura was nice and the sauce complemented them nicely. We will be back!",

My food came out while my boyfriend decided on tempura sides and his came out while we talked to the cashier. The niku udon was great and very filling. Will come again while on this side of town.",

    "text": "This place is very yummy!!! I went here for the first time today. The portions are very large. I got nabiyaki udon and wasn't able to finish it. The udon is chewy, just like the udon I used to eat as a kid! The broth is also very savory. It was a bit confusing when I first came here though. You have to order and then you'll get a receipt and buzzer. Then you have to walk up to the actual cashier to pay (I don't understand this 2 step process). Then you can find a seat and when the buzzer rings, you don't actually go up to get your food. They'll bring it to you. Regardless, it was a nice experience. I expected the restaurant to be smaller, but it's actually very spacious! Would definitely recommend!!",

Two out of the 4 items that I wanted to order were not available, but pretty impressed with the two replacement items, which meant that I would have to come back again to try out the two items that I never got to try out today. :)",
