First problem was they pushed 2 tables together resulting in them being uneven with each other = disaster when putting wine glasses down. Unacceptable .. Not even an apology or offer to correct the problem.   Service was extremely slow and the restaurant was NOT full. We got our wine & beverages &'appetizers approx. 10 min before our meal came!! We couldn't even get a waiters attention to bring us wine!   The food was average. Nothing I couldn't cook as well in my own kitchen. The dessert was a treat.. I will say the Cake Boss knows his desserts. That was about it. Sad to say I won't be returning to Busdy V's",

Must orders: Calamari - one of the best we've ever had Lasagna- the best we've ever had Meatballs- better than mine and the best we've ever had  We also had  Parmesan chicken- moist and yummy probably the best one we've had as it has a tendency to be dry but this one wasn't.  Linguine and clams- very good Cheese pizza - kids liked it  I will definitely come back!!  Tried the bakery earlier and discovered this gem.    Don't forget to ask for Rosemary fresh bread and dip into oil with Parmesan....",

Where parking can sometimes be a pain but usually plentiful.  Establishment:  Service was okay it was a tad bit slow but not annoyingly so. *3 stars*  Food (Brunch):  To begin there is an all you can drink for about $15 which is probably worth it if you plan on having more than 1 drink. Bringing your total to about $50 a person.   The concept of quality over quantity definitely applies here there is probably about 10 dishes of breakfast items and some Italian dishes some of their Italian dishes were just okay though but nothing I regretted trying.  What shines here though is their dessert. They have a glorious display of desserts that will be sure to satisfy your sweet tooth. *4 stars*  Overall:  First brunch in Vegas so nothing to compare to but for the price I thought it was very enjoyable especially after 3 sangrias.",

Pretty much a nonstop flow of people refilling our drinks, taking our plates, checking in on us and making conversation.  There was kind of a weird moment at first when our group first came in and went up to the hostess podium and two young guys up at the front literally just turned and walked off without saying anything, but later on made up for it.    Most of the food was delicious (a few hot items were cold already due to there being too much AC in here, as other reviewers have mentioned, but it's not under their control).  They have mini cronuts!  And really excellent french toast.  Our whole group was very satisfied - there was something for everyone - seafood, veggie items, fancy meats, lots of sweet stuff.",

The serious woman waiter wrote the final total payment for me and asked me to sign my name. She wrote 25% tips for me and she did not even smile to me. Maybe I look like Asian and she think that I would never come here twice. After she asked me to sign my name for paying,she just left and did not give me a chance to ask her the question. Maybe I look young and Asian. I am studying in America and I just finished my final. I want to have great time in Las vegas,but this experience really made me upset. I just want to share my True experience here. I would never come here again. Thank you.",

The brunch had quite a few items from the menu and everything was exceptional.  Also the wait staff were really fantastic.  Everyone was friendly and ready  to help in any way.

Our waiter was also incredibly cool, and we definitely enjoyed the overall experience. The food was American-Italian as all get out, and among some of the best for that style you can expect to get.   However; the things that drop the rating down are more about the overall experience. The starters were okay (meatballs), and the whole place/atmosphere overall was a bit iffy. The chairs are your standard fare for restaurants like this, and seemed really flimsy and were uncomfortable. The drink list felt a little lacking, and I feel like the suggested drinks were more a marketing speech more than a genuine recommendation.   Negatives aside; dat veal parm was just fantastic. Hardly can think of another that I like more, it definitely stands there near the top of some of the best I've had of that particular dish. Want more....",

I ordered their Chicken Picatta and was blown away. I think I've probably had Chicken Picatta three times in my life. This was the best I've ever had. The lemon and garlic sauce was buttery, but not too thick and the pasta was cooked perfectly; as well as the chicken. I also enjoyed their bread that's cooked fresh. Everyone else was also very pleased with their meal. Two thumbs up!",

    "text": "This review is for Buddy V's brunch. It's $34.95 with soda, ice tea, or coffee from 10:30am to 2:30pm (I think) on Saturday and Sunday. In short, it's awesome. It's probably our favorite brunch on The Strip due to the selection, quality, value, and service.   The selection is huge and there's a menu online but for a brief recap there's a carving station (ham, bacon, 2 kinds of sausages), shrimp cocktail, eggs/frittata, charcuterie station, a couple kinds of pasta, meatballs, chicken parmesan, salad, french toast, crespelle, pastries, like 5 kinds of cookies, like 4 kinds of cakes, cannolis, and fruit. A nice touch is that there's two sets of meatballs/chicken parmesan so if one is empty you can get some from the other station. They were great about refilling the dishes and every trip I went up, everything was available.  It's a buffet so don't expect things to be the same as ordering from Buddy V's off the menu. That being said, it was all still very good. Even the fruit was good (because it was sweet), and they had more exotic options like dragon fruit and rambutan as well.   Service was friendly and they were very good about refilling drinks and clearing plates. All that said, I think what you get is very good for the price.",

They asked If they could help me as I approached their station. I asked them why they don't pick up the call on hold? They told that they can't tell a call is waiting and that happens all of the time. Knuckleheads! Tell the owner. Tell the Mgr. Tell someone. A TERRIBLE start.",

Luckily, we made it in time for happy hour - drinks were $4 and food was $5! The regular dinner menu itself is a little pricey so the happy hour is definitely a steal.   We all got a round of sangria - perfect amount to get you a little tipsy at dinner! For $4, the drinks are the best deal because you can't get a $4 cocktail anywhere in Vegas. We ordered some of the $5 appetizers from the happy hour menu for dinner. We all got an order of the meatball sliders which is their famous Grandma's meatballs in small burger buns. I would highly recommend ordering these! The flavor was delicious and it was a good size. We also ordered calamari to share, and tried the mac and cheese carbonara. The calamari was nice and crispy, and came with fried jalepenos. The mac and cheese was okay...super creamy and the noodles were a bit overcooked.   Service was a little slow as there was only one waitress for the outside happy hour patio. But would highly recommend coming here for happy hour for some drinks and snacks especially before going out!",

Pretty fast and friendly service -bussers were always making sure you don't go thirsty. Portion sizes are on the larger side, but leftover pasta is always great. The sunday gravy special is pretty solid, perfect for a meat lover - spicy sausage, pork, meatballs. Rigatoni and the sauce were pretty good. Orrechiete sausage pasta had good texture and flavor as well. For dessert the warm nutella cake was their most popular- it was great. Cannoli was unfortunately not as tasty and had a strong cinnamon flavor that somehow reminded us of Fireball whiskey - not that pleasant. Overall not bad, not great.  3.75/5.",

Appetizers were also amazing, though definitely ask about serving sizes because some are much larger than others!   Overall I had a great experience!",

All of the food was out of this world. My wife had the Caesar salad, chicken Parmesan, and Canoli. She really enjoyed the food. Also, I should mention that the restaurant overlooks the strip and has an awesome view. Come here. It is reasonably priced with great service and awesome Italian food.",

Let me tell you about my mother: - She was born in Calabria, Italy - Loves Italian food (given), but almost never goes out for Italian food since we have it with family often and her standards are high. - She does not like to spend money, everything is compared to a cheaper alternative and rarely thinks money is well spent at restaurants.   Our waiter hyped up the family style dining experience, which we usually do on our own. The fact they had a program to do so was great to hear, and it did not disappoint.  The food was amazing. Exceeded all of our expectations. We had a great spread that really covered all the bases from the menu. One dish was better than the next.  The waiter, Georgio, was the best in the business. I've eaten at great restaurants around the world and had great service but he was truly world class and made the night. He was funny and entertaining but did not overdue it. Sometimes you get a funny or personable waiter who you like but they are too busy chatting they forget a request or get distracted, but not Georgio. He even sang happy birthday to my mother in Italian which really was the icing on the cake.   It was a night to remember, thank you to Buddy V's for making it special!",

I almost didn't give this place a shot because we did not like Carlo's bakery very much, but this place turned out to be so great! We were seated within 10 minutes and got a great table next to a window with a view of the strip and right next to the live music. Our waiter provided great service and my mom even got a flower for Mother's Day. We ordered the Salmon, Chicken Parm and Garlic Bread. All of it was so delicious! The salmon was cooked perfectly and the chicken was tender and juicy. The spaghetti had great flavor, I definitely recommend getting the extra Parmesan on top and adding some crushed red pepper! I also love that they offer unsweetened tea and come around to provide refills regularly. There are so many restaurants to choose from in Vegas, but I would probably go back here next time and try some other items off the menu. (The spaghetti in my picture looked prettier when it came out,  I messed it up)",

It was perfect timingly as there was absolutely no wait time when we went and we were seated right away.  So my husband and I both decided to try his pasta, but we first started off with his meatballs as an appetizer.  They were decently sized but to our disappointment, there was not much flavor to it.  We were expecting a burst of flavor but there wasn't much to it except for ground meat.  Not much seasoning to it at all and it was honestly, something that I make better at home.  For the main course, I ordered the chicken regatoni \"alla vodka,\" which I always have to try at all italien restaurants.  It was pretty good except a bit on the salty side.  My husband ordered the \"my dad's bucatini carbonara\" which he thought was just ok.  Our waiter was very helpful and did suggest the meatballs for us to try.  Everything else about the restaurant was great.",

The most tender flavorful meatballs I've ever had!! The applewood bacon turkey club was also delicious!! Perfect amount of everything with good balance of flavors.

With that being said, my girlfriend and I were very happy with our meals and exceptional service. Walked in around 5PM on a Tuesday night. We were quickly seated. We each ordered a sangria which shockingly were only $4 each since it was happy hour. They were delicious. Lots of good fruit in them. They were not cheapened because of HR.   We each ordered the same dinner, the rigatoni with lamb, pork, meatballs. and sausage. At a $26 price tag, I was very happy. Most Strip Italian places will charge $18+ just a plate of spaghetti alone. We meats were tender and delicious as was the sauce. The pasta, cook perfectly. Freshly baked bread was served before dinner as well. Again, delicious.   I look forward to returning. The service was as stellar as the food.",

The menu has such a great variety of classic  Italian staples. It was hard to decide what we were going to eat.  For the appetizer, we ordered Mozzarella en Carozza (\"mozzarella in a carriage\").  Hands down, this was the most delicious appetizer we've had in such a long time.  The crust was nice and crispy.  But the gravy (sauce) just took it over the top.  It was so full of flavor.  It was a nice balance of tomatoes and basil.   For the main course, my hubby ordered the Sunday Gravy.  I loved the presentation.  They served the meat in a separate metal pot.  Plenty of sausage, lamb necks, pork and meatballs.  It's served with rigatoni.  This entree was so tasty that we immediately started looking for the recipe on the internet.  I ordered the Linguini with Clams.  It came with plenty of clams.  The portion sizes were perfect.  We were pretty stuffed by the time we were done with our meals.  However, we wanted to try a dessert while we were there.  I loved the dessert menu. It looks like a family photo album with pictures of Buddy and his family.  We selected the Italian Wedding Cake.  I didn't think I had any room for dessert.  But this little cake was so good that we knew we had to finish it all. Luckily we had a long walk ahead of us. The restaurant was at the far end of the shops in the Venetian.  We will definitely make this a must the next time we're in Las Vegas.   You should too.  We plan to try the chicken parm.  The atmosphere was what were looking for.  It was like a huge Italian farmhouse kitchen.  And you could see into the kitchen.  Loved the whole experience.",

My husband had the chicken Parmesan and I had the chicken rigatoni with vodka sauce. Everything was so good and the only thing we could say is it didn't taste like restaurant food, it tasted homemade. We also had to order the lobster tail. Even after a bottle of wine and our dinner it was so light and airy. Amazing. When Daniel found out it was our anniversary he brought out a plate of Italian cookies and bottle of sparkling dessert champagne. It was such a great experience all around and next time we come to Vegas we will be coming back to Buddy V's!",

Next time I go, I might just ask for a side of croutons with my salad because WOW. Because I split our main courses with someone else, I got to try both the Bucatini Carbonara and the Spaghetti Bolognese. I personally preferred the Carbonara, because I thought the sauce had struck the perfect balance and the noodles were great, but the other person slightly preferred the Bolognese. Moral of the story: both were excellent. We finished with cannoli and tiramisu. Both were, as you could have guessed, fantastic. Moreover, the servers were very friendly and we felt that they paced the meal perfectly. I can't wait to go back.  However, before you do, make sure to call and ask if the prixe fixe is on the menu that day because, when we first arrived, even though it was a Thursday at noon, the waiter said that he had to check.  UPDATE: I came back, and learned that we are not limited to their packaged breadsticks for lunch. Instead, they have (free) focaccia bread. All you have to do is ask for it, and then someone will come around with a big pan of focaccia bread. Make sure to ask for the olive oil and vinegar too!!",

I absolutely ADORED the decor, from the lighting fixtures to the brick walls displaying real photos of Buddy Valasco's family, to the STUNNING open-air kitchen!! I just felt HAPPY being in engulfed in the ambiance of this restaurant!   The staff was so friendly and the food was classic, comfort and delicious. (don't miss that salumi/cheese board! YUMMMMMM)  This will be the next place that I plan a big get-together because it is PERFECT for large parties. Can't say it enough... I LOVE it!!!!!!",

I don't know where to start, but I do know that Italian food is one of my favorite genre of food (other than Thai or sushi) and I can be a picky one when it comes to taste. I must say the service at this restaurant was impeccable, and the food was all sorts of delicious. Their wine selection was pretty impressive so that is another plus. I recommend the Calamari for an appetizer or the mozzarella en Carozza, which is basically fried mozzarella. I have only been here once so the dish I had was the lasagna. I make lasagna from scratch at home so I know good lasagna, and it was delicious.",

The red and white checkered tablecloths on the tables in front of the restaurant made it obvious we had arrived.   Buddy's is very spacious inside. I loved the decor of lights made with whisks from large mixers. Also, the rolling pins hanging and bundt pans were so creative. It felt very cozy and welcoming.   On to the food! There were breadsticks waiting on the table. We were pleasantly surprised when they brought out olive oil and balsamic with warm focaccia bread...melted in your mouth. The bread was so soft, yet crunchy at the same time! We ordered the meatball sub with Tuscan fries, the Margherita pizza and kids spaghetti with tomato sauce. The Margherita pizza wasn't exactly as thin as most that I've had but very good! The crust was soft and a little thicker with chunks of tomatoes and fresh basil. My daughter ate so much spaghetti she couldn't believe how good it was.   On to dessert! I loved how the dessert menu had pictures of Buddy's family, so sweet! We opted for the warm Nutella chocolate melting cake with salted Carmel ice cream. Words cannot even describe...we fought over it with our forks...it almost got ugly. There was not a crumb left.   The service was great. I wanna come back for dinner now!  Con: the only thing negative which was quickly fixed, my daughter ordered a Shirley temple. It had no taste, tasted like colored water. No idea what the problem was but they brought another out and it was perfect.",

It's very nice, with a full seating bar on one side with a big screen TV and then the dining room on the other side.  We opted to sit at a table in the bar so we could watch our home town Seahawks play Monday night football.  Very nice menu with lots of choices.  Pretty typical price wise of most restaurants in this caliber.  I opted for pasta and clam sauce.  Was ok, not wonderful although our server raved about it.  Hubs ordered lasagne which I tasted and it was really good but the portion was big enough for three people which is just wasteful.  We had split a Caesar salad and believe me, don't try to eat an entire salad.  They are typical Las Vegas size.  Best part of the salad were the polenta croutons.  Really good.  The salad had way too much dressing.  Also get a side of bread and olive oil as a starter.  Bread wasn't warm and felt stale to the touch.  Biggest turn off, the two young ladies acting as hostess for the restaurant were at a podium right in front of us while we were eating.  They spent the entire time playing with each other's hair.  Not very appetizing.",

Everything was amazing! The coffee, the Nutella Volcano (or something like that), the tiramisu and the cocktails, the bella regazza wow, tbh we had 2 and it was not for the ladies at the table.  The place is \"hard to find\" have to really look for it inside the Venetian but I'll be worth it. I don't feel that there's the need to say this but, the place is kinda pricey (obviously).",

    "text": "While in Vegas I'm always tempted to go out to a buffet for dinner, but since my friends wanted something less gluttonous, we decided to come here. I have absolutely no regrets and would recommend anyone to come here for an easy dinner. My one point off is for service. Although everyone was very attentive, it seemed disorganized as different people came to serve us water/drinks and we ended up having 8 cups of water on our table instead of 4.  FOOD:  Rigatoni ala vodka $24 - This was very tasty and hit my cravings for a creamy tomato sauce. The pasta was cooked right, chicken was tender, and overall finished all the pasta with a very full belly.  Cabonara $24 - Pretty tasty and a little peppery. I really love creamy pastas so this was definitely worth a try. The noodles were al dente and pretty tasty. However I still think that the Rigatoni ala vodka was better.  Pro tip: If you are looking to be seated at a normal dining table, be sure to make a reservation in advance. We did not know this and were seated at the bar area which did not bother us. However, if you want a more 'date night' atmosphere, a reservation and specifying to sit at a normal dining table may be the way to go here.",

We made it for happy hour, and took advantage of some $5 sangria and Grandma's meatballs! The starter bread was awesome and the sauces were perfectly seasoned. I got the lasagna and it was awesome. My wife got the shrimp scampi and she loved it! We sat on the patio, but next time I will make a reservation for a view of the strip inside.

    "text": "Found this place based on Yelp review because we were craving Italian food. It's across from Carlo's bakery. Different menus  are offered throughout the day. Ours was 'Sunset', from 3-5pm and it was perfect. Only a few tables were taken. When you walked in, it was a typical family upscale-but-casual Italian restaurant. The staff were efficient but a little robotic. Some staff dropped off the hot coffee which we didn't order and they didn't notice till we pointed out. We ordered chicken Parmesan, linguine white wine sauce and clams and Hoboken iced tea. The staff brought out the warm focaccia bread not long before the meal. The pasta were delicious and I loved my linguine with clams. Very simple ingredients and they did a great job. I wish that I could get this where I live. Salud, see you next time!",

Love the freebies they give out (oh my lord; enough to go there just for that), but a funny thing happened to me, friends... while being stranded at the cesspool of a hotel called Mirage (conference; avoid at all costs). I walked across the street, yesterday... and decided to finally check out this \"Cake Boss\" place. I was expecting mediocre food. Big portions. I mean... he makes cakes for f*ck's sake. Cakes. What the hell does he know about Italian food (aside from being Italian)?  Well, now... I have been converted. First, they have a live band most nights (Nicholas and his brother; jazzy, very talented). I sat at the bar and privately swooned over the charming and achingly pretty bartender,  \"Christian.\" She has the most beautiful eyes. The most, um.... What? Hey. This is my review. I'll write what I want. Get out of my head.  Ok ok... the food. Had the spaghetti carbonara last night. Best I've had. Ordered the spaghetti bolognese tonight. Best I've had. See the pattern? So, what I'm saying is... Buddy V's is legit. This is the Italian restaurant you want. Is for me now.",

I recommend making a reservation for dinner because the place is usually pretty busy even in the middle of the week. The decor is nice and upscale and the space itself is large. I love that they had live music during dinner.  Everything I have tried here is absolutely excellent. We usually start off with the garlic bread, although you are given fresh bread with olive oil and vinegar. The fried calamari is also excellent. A lot of people order the meatballs but I have yet to try them!  For entrees, we usually stick with the delicious pastas. My go to is Chicken Rigatoni \"Alla\" Vodka. Very filling! If you have a lot of room for food or are very hungry then I recommend getting the lasagna because it could literally last you 2-3 meals. The portions are huge!  Overall, this place is excellent for authentic Italian food!",

    "text": "This is one of those places that already has so many reviews and popularity, there is really no point in making yet another. But that's why my nickname is Ol' Pointless Kevin.   I got the 3 course meal and chose a panzanella salad, chicken parm, and and a cannoli.    I haven't had a panzanella salad before to compare it too, but research shows the main points of it are tomato and croutons, which this did seem to be based on. But I have a feeling it is not traditional recipe, as it had a grip load of delicious fresh cheese, several types of greens, and other veggies. Or maybe it's one of those things that varies region by region in Italy. At any rate, I think this elevated it into something more interesting than a basic panzanella salad. Very good.  Next came the chicken parm. Huge portion of chicken, plenty of cheese, and very tasty pasta on the side with clearly scratch made sauce. However, the pasta portion was a portion for ants. I saw pictures of this on other reviews and the portions appeared to be double normally. Maybe they ran out of noods and that's all they had left, though I mean that seems strange for an Italian place. Maybe it's just sort of a random portion each time and the pasta Gods were not on my side this time. On a sidenote, I can't eat chicken parm anymore without my mind going straight to the Impractical Jokers sketch where Q is just naming absurd parms like \"donkey parm, gorilla parm. . .\"  The cannoli was easily the best I ever had. Gigantor size. One side had choco chips and the other pistachios. Only a soulless monster could complain about this. Obviously the Cake Boss is going to make excellent desserts. I need to try their bakery across the hall next time.   So yeah, overall did a good job of hitting that Italian food fix.",

There are many choices, but not a ton like \"normal\" buffets which I liked because I didn't feel pressured to try everything and get too full on things I disliked. It's also very nice that the cooks create the items in small batches. I felt like everything was fresh and delicious because of this.   My favorite items were the ham, eggs, and crepes which you can top to your liking.   I also found my way to the desserts to have myself a Buddy style dessert and even grabbed a handful of candy that was out in jars.   This restaurant was very accommodating and pleasant to be in. My girlfriend and I were seated right near a window looking out at the strip and away from the large groups. It felt private and is the reason we are going back this upcoming weekend.

He mentioned to us how he is Italian & grew up with his mothers authentic cooking. The moscato & cucumber mule we ordered were delicious. I ordered \"My Dad's Bucatini Carbonara\" & I can honestly say, it's the best Italian dish I have ever tasted. The food & desserts tasted very fresh. It's a little on the spendy side, but worth every penny.",

I had already eaten half of my pasta when I took the picture and My husband barely made a dent in his huge sandwich and mountain of parmesan fries (which were the best fries we've ever had!). I didn't order any extra protein on my pasta, but that didn't take away from its amazing flavor and heartiness. We aren't used to paying $23 for pasta, but this was worth it! We ate to our hearts' content and still have food left over. Staff was extremely friendly and attentive! Our server moved us to a table near a window, looking out over the strip- extra tip for him! The atmosphere was very pleasant and had a nice feel. I'd come here again!",

No hesitation, she asked for a minute to have table swept and immediately prepared.   The waiter and the support staff immediately started service even with a full house.  Great team work for service.    Fresh bread and olive oil was nice.  The meatballs are worth it just to dip the bread.  Kid's spaghetti was high quality and nice with the meatballs to start.  Pasta perfectly cooked.  Caesar was large enough to share with 3 and a real Caesar dressing.  It was really good with unique croutons.    The Brocalini was great.  But the lasagna was best and perfect.  The wines are appropriate and match nice.  Prices are very reasonable considering location and level of service. The service team was great and a joy.  They treated my daughter with respect and wasn't condescending despite her age, 6 years.   I'm very dissappointed at myself for bypassing this place all my previous trips to Vegas.  This is now my go to place for Italian on the strip.  Very homey and tasty.  Really high quality and straight forward.  Nothing complex needed.",

The eggplant parm was actually hard, so I'm glad it was a shared appetizer instead of a meal. I had read great things about the lasagna...but I must say, I was slightly disappointed.  The portions were huge but if nothing about the dish makes you want to  eat more then who cares?  The chicken parm was GREAT!  But the pasta it came with was OVERLY salty!!!  The Osso Bucco and Polenta were OUTSTANDING as was the Veal in bone parm....although another party at the table complained there was too much cheese on that.  The XL Lobster Tail for dessert is to die for :) ...and I really loved the cannoli.  The ambiance was great....and like I said, the service was stellar!  The portions were great, ... I just have a few complaints....and a few disappointments.  Would still give it another try to taste a few more things before discounting it.",

We loved the best of course in Boston little Italy and Buddy Vs is as close as it gets.  I had the Osso Buco and my husband had the ravioli,  and both were amazing. We had to keep sharing with everybody at our table.  The only trouble we had was finding it.  It is on the second floor, but we kept asking for directions from everybody in the Venetian  and nobody could tell us.  Finally a drink server put her full tray of drinks down and went to a wall phone and got directions for us. You would think they would have training on directions in the hotel on how to get what you are looking for.  But it was definitely worth the navigating.  We will be coming back again!",

According to our internet search for top Las Vegas restaurants for Thanksgiving dinner 2015, Buddy V's was showing a delicious menu including a squash soup to start and a main plate, all for $28/person.  When we arrived, it was $10 for soup and $29 for the main plate.  They explained that somehow, it was the 2014 menu and pricing showing online.  The soup arrived and it was way too sweet.  It should have been served as dessert, not an appetizer.  I barely had three spoonfuls and when  they took it away, they didn't even ask if it was ok.  The main course arrived and it was tasty, but cold.  We sent it back and asked for it to be hot.  When the second plate arrived 10 minutes or so later, it was still cold.  We hoped that the third time would be a charm, but it wasn't.  Half the plate was hot, half was cold.  I'm sure they must have microwaved it.  The really scary thing was that half the turkey and sausage was gone, so I'm still wondering if they served me my plate or someone else's plate.  We spent over $250 for four with a $40 bottle of wine, before tip, and were tremendously disappointed with the service, and the fact that they're incapable of serving hot food, despite several attempts.  The flavor was good, but that is not sufficient to give them our business a second time.",

The service was good, the meatball appetizer was good, and the fresh bread was great. This is where it stops, the spaghetti was somewhat chef boyardee tasting and the chicken parmigiana lacked flavor. Consequently the only flavor from that dish was from the cheese, which was all cheese no chicken. At this point the wife and I chalk it up to a loss and believing the hype and figures hey the desert has to be good, after all it's the cake boss right. WRONG!!!! This was probably the most disappointing part of the meal we got the cannoli and tiramisu. The cannoli was bland and lacked any depth and the tiramisu was also boring lacked any real flavor and to boot was but in a small Masson jar. Oh let's not forget the cookies that were served with the cannoli they were as hard as a biscotti. Now I can chalk up the good as a loss but the desert really?! That should have been second to none. The bottom line, if you want good Italian food and dessert go anywhere else but this overrated excuse of an Italian restaurant!!!!",

But we felt our waiter although very nice was not totally truthful and sneaky. We had ordered a salad and the fried mozzarella for an appetizer, both were delicious! But our waiter casually asked if we wanted cheesy garlic bread and the way he asked it came across that it was complementary...it wasn't $9.00 :/ the other thing was that my husband and I had both ordered beers, and when I had ordered mine he pulled out the menu and pointed to two choices and asked which one I wanted...I just pointed to the smaller of the two choices. When we got our bill it turned out he had added on a souvenir glass (an extra $5.00) without informing me that was what he was doing. So we felt we got a little bit scammed into adding on all these extras. So ask questions before you just say \"sure!\" to something.",

OK tell me what Italian Restaurant doesn't serve bread... you have to order garlic bread full of grease flavor garlic not even real butter flavor and smothered in melting cheese... how about some nice Italian bread you can dip in olive oil ...the Caesar salad didn't have any anchovies on it,,,, HELLO Italian eat anchovies,,, the portions were very small and just NOT GOOD.... the Lobster Claw said it was filled with Canoli filling and cream... sorry it was just straight whipped cream with baileys in it.... very disappointing.  I'm a NYer and I know what a real lobster claw is supposed to be..., I will never go there again and OMG the prices were very expensive.... 2 for lunch came to $100.00 and it wasn't good at all... Sorry Buddy... you need to get those people trained right... and get some good bread in there...",

    "text": "My boyfriend had some pasta that had chicken and a vodka sauce.  I desperately wished I had ordered that instead of the scallops.  The scallops I had were seared pretty nicely and had capers around them for some saltiness, but I kinda wished I had salt or something besides mashed potatos with them.  Mashed potatos and scallops kinda don't go together in my head.  Anyways, his food was so good I kept eating off his plate and he kept letting me because I'm his girlfriend so he has to...  The calamari was also okay.  Compared to Nora's it wasn't that great but if you aren't a spoiled brat then yeah, the calamari is Ok.  I also had the nutella cake with icecream and that was Ok too.  The icecream was raved about by my server last night, and he told me that it is the same icecream as Honeysalt.  I thought I had had it before!!!  I didn't care for the cake so much and just picked out the Nutella.  I don't know why I got that because I can have Nutella at home.  I should have gotten some different dessert.  I will know now for next time to get the pasta and get a different dessert.  That dang vodka sauce and pasta was SO good.",

    "text": "So sad!  We had such high hopes for this place.  We eat out a lot (in fact we are trying a new restaurant every day this winter break!)  This restaurant cannot compete with anything else nearby.  Maggiano's -fabulous, Brio - lovely, Buddy V's -meh.  We had the meatball sand and the vodka sauce pasta.  Both were bland, small and overpriced ($23 for a very small plate of pasta.). No hot bread and butter, no attentive wait staff, no one asked how are meals were, we were invisible.  Then we come to the real reason we went - the lobster tail pastry.  At $15 we were sure it would be crazy good.  It wasn't. The cream inside was luscious and the presentation was beautiful, but the pastry itself was so hard and overcooked we couldn't cut it and that made sharing difficult.  Worst of all, I left my commemorative photo of my little girl and I from  the National Geographic exhibit on the table.  When we realized this 2 hours later we rushed back to the restaurant.  They had thrown it out!  Who doesn't keep people's forgotten things for at least the rest of the day?!  A very bad $64 lunch and a sad tale to tell.",

The restaurant had a nice, homey atmosphere with an open kitchen. It was fun to see the meals being prepped and watching them come out. We started with the caprese salad and fried calamari. The burrata was delicious. The calamari was crisp and light and very tender. For our main diss, we shared the Valestro family gravy. What a hit! We both loved the \"gravy\" ! Very authentic, homemade sauce..Italian husband said one of the best he's ever tasted. Portions were nicely sized. Sever was on point but not very attentive. One HUGE complaint..a bread basket was not provided!! A great Italian restaurant with no bread so sop up all of that saucy goodness??! Come on Buddy! Breadsticks in a bag! You can do a lot better than that! Lost a star on the bread issue...We will return on our next visit..with our own loaf of Italian bread!",

    "text": "I was excited to try this place, especially bc the owner is the star of TLC's reality show 'Cake Boss.' I had high expectations, but unfortunately, they were not met.   I took the safe route and ordered Chicken Parmesan. This dish is pretty difficult to mess up since it's so common and every Italian restaurant has it. But to my surprise, it was just....Bleh. Nothing spectacular about it. Tasted better everywhere else.   I was with 7 other girls, who ordered a variety of dishes. All didn't seem wow'ed at all, too. Two girls ordered the same thing (forgot what they ordered), but one girl's dish was way more salty than the other. We all had a taste of both girls' dish and agreed.   Service was also just.... Bleh. Whenever we asked our waiter for something, he had a lame excuse why it couldn't be done or if it can be done, he would take forever to do so. One thing I don't like is how they can't split up checks. Even very small restaurants don't have problems with splitting checks now a days. I also don't like paying a lot for food that's less than mediocre.   I must add though that their dessert menu looked amazing. Too bad none of us were in a mood to try anything. I MIGHT be back to try out a dessert or two when I make it out here again to L.V.",

In support of Restaurant Week we ordered off the special menu.  The Caprese Salad was perfect. Nice variety of heirloom tomatoes, silky burrata, and the green beans was an interesting addition  The entree of Spaghetti Bolognese was just the right size. The meat was very tasty and the sauce flavorful.  Dessert was Zeppole coated with spiced sugar and served with a raspberry dipping sauce.

I had Grandma's Meatballs for my app & Chicken Parm as my entree. Restaurant week's portion came with 4 meatballs. 2 pieces of chicken & a small but good size spaghetti. Both were just amazing. So much flavor in the meatballs & you can see the herbs when you cut into it. The breading on the chicken parm was perfect. Not too thick so it's not filling. The spaghetti sauce was simple & delicious. Mini donuts as the dessert with a chocolate & raspberry I think it was sauce to dip. 5 small pieces I believe. Spiced sugar coating the outside of the donut.   The specialty cocktail list was awesome! Everything looked good! I ordered the DRAGO ROSSO-absolut ruby red, pomegranate, jalapeno & mango. A spicy treat! I've always wanted to try a spicy cocktail & this one was amazing. I had to take small sips cause my throat burned a little! The jalapeno seeds were floating at the top too. I think I should have asked the bartender to not make it that spicy. But it was good! Priced at $14.   The restaurant is beautiful! It's huge. The kitchen was open so you can watch them cook (love that). Brick walls & floor to ceiling windows with great views of the Strip. There are old pictures everywhere & cool decor. Unique chandeliers & a great wine shelf! We had a great table next to the window :)   Service was great! Everyone was so nice. I even got a birthday dessert from them with a sparkler attached! I will be coming back!",

He even told my friend that what she was planning to order was too boring and she would probably prefer something else! He made a recommendation and she ended up loving it! My dish was nothing short of fantastic and next time I'm in Vegas will definitely be going back! The bread before dinner was served warm with traditional oil and tasted soooooo good.   My only suggestion is definitely talk to them ahead of time about how the checks are going to work. We felt bad making him split it a couple ways because it took a while in the system.",

The open floor plan just makes the restaurants main Dining area feel like it's right in the middle of the mall. However despite this minor flaw the food here is authentic. Our waiter was from Naples and had a True passion for the food he was serving. Our apps were delicious including the Caesar salad and calamari. The meatballs were top notch. For dinner I ordered the mixed meats with pasta. The dish had a name but I can't remember for the life of me what it was called. The lamb was fatty though which is why I can't go to five stars. Plus the dish was missing a component in my opinion. Like maybe some cheese or vegetables. My friends dishes all looked good. No one seemed   blown away but we were definitely satisfied and impressed by the cleanliness and authentic Italian cuisine we were served.",

We went earlier in the day just so we could know where in the mall it was located. I'm glad we did since it was off a corridor from the main forum shops. We liked how the place looked. Well set up and inviting. They had a long row of outside tables in front of the restaurant.   So we go to the place and they found our reservation and went to seat us. They brought us into the bar and sat us in the corner with a view of the strip. I didn't mind the view but if I made reservations why was I sitting at the bar? Kinda of set the mode already. It was not to crowded for a Friday night which we were very surprised when most restaurants are hopping. There were bread stick on the table already but they were prepackaged ones and not from Italy, they were made in New Jersey.   We wanted the best from Buddy so my wife ordered his wife's linguine and clam sauce. While I had Buddy's chicken rigatoni \"ALLA VODKA\". My wife's meal was plain and not worth the $26 that they charged for it. It tasted like my wife made it herself nothing fancy or fantastic taste. Mine had maybe 6 pieces of chicken in it and the pasta was kind of chewy. It was like my wife made it also. Not saying I wouldn't eat it but not real fine dining. We have been to several restaurants in Vegas since we go 4-6 times a year. So I'm no newbie.   Oh I missed the garlic bread we ordered before the meal. Which consisted of three pieces for 9. Nothing special and little over priced again. My wife and I agreed Buddy should of opened a cafe type restaurant and not fine dining. The food is more family food but over priced for Vegas. It would be totally packed everyday if the prices were lower and family orientated.   But not to jam on Buddy over his place. We had the Italian birthday cake and let me tell you it was no disappointment. We loved it and that what Buddy is famous for Cakes. I wish he had a bakery with the restaurant because that would go no stop. Hope this helps you guys out. thanks",

My fiance and I were able to be seated right away without a reservation, but we did go on a Monday evening so that may be why. I wish we were seated at another table because the waitress we had got on our nerves. My fiance and I do not drink, so when asked if we wanted any alcoholic drinks, we declined. Our waitress looked at us like we were from outer space and make little comments the rest of the night about us not having a drink or two. I thought it was very rude of her to do so. The food was tasteful, but slightly expensive for what you get. I've had spaghetti that's been more flavorful before, but the garlic bread was out-of-this-world good. The atmosphere is calm and the decor is very nice. Overall, I would eat at Buddy V's again, but would order something different than spaghetti.",

I don't eat fish so I can't vouch for it personally. We finished with the Italian birthday cake. It was very moist and flavorful without being too sweet. The price was a little high, but this is a celebrity chef with a restaurant on the vegas strip what would you expect. In the end we left satisfied and happier than when we went in.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were looking for somewhere special to celebrate our anniversary. We spent a good hour narrowing down Italian food restaurants based on reviews and the menu, and we were very disappointed with our experience at Buddy V's. When you walk in the atmosphere is very welcoming, dimly lit, guy playing the piano, and nice decor. That's where the nice experience ends. Once we sat down, our waiter tried to hard sell us on this wine that was clearly the wine the restaurant wanted the waiters to sell that night. We had to tell him \"not interested\" at least 3 times. I don't expect to get hassled and given the \"hard sell\" by our server at a really nice restaurant. The food we received tasted like it had been frozen and reheated. Definitely did not taste fresh. We started out with the Meatball appetizer. The meatballs had no \"crispiness\" to the outside. The sauce was thin and had no flavor.  My boyfriend got the Lasagna (which was supposed to be their signature dish), and I got the Pasta alla Vodka (normally very yummy if done right). The sauce with the Lasagna was runny and had no flavor. He even commented that the Lasagna I made at home tasted better than what he got at Buddy V's. As for my Pasta alla Vodka, the sauce was runny and had no flavor, the chicken was tough, and the pasta wasn't cooked enough. I went to an Italian food restaurant in Shenzhen China that had better Pasta alla Vodka. To top it off, the menu prices were $25+, which is kind of what you expect from Vegas, but I expect top quality food at that price, and especially from a celebrity chef. Do not eat here.",

Our evening started out with us walking up to the hostess station around 5:15 that Sunday evening.  We asked the two ladies if we could have a window table.  They stated it was going to be about 20 to 30 minutes.  We stated no problem that we will go to the bar and have a drink to please come over and get us when the table was ready.  They stated that was fine.  We ordered two drinks at the bar and about 20 minutes later we saw two tables being cleaned at the window area.  So my husband was paying close attention and before we knew it the hostess was taking up a couple that had just arrived.  Luckily a table was being cleared up behind them so my husband had to go grab the hostess to remind her of our table.  She then remembered we were waiting and sat us down.  Point being, if my husband wasn't keeping an eye out we would have lost those window seats we were waiting on.   Now on to our next adventure, we meet our waiter Perry M., he asked if we wanted water and we stated we did.  The assistant waiter came through and gave us bread and I stated thank you to him, but got no response back.  Perry then came back and got our food order.  The food came out as scheduled and was delivered by a young gentleman from the kitchen.  Our assistant waiter came by and gave us more bread and again I said Thank You with no response.  I come from the south and when someone says thank you, your response should be Your Welcome or My Pleasure.  To me this is plain rude.  Again, we are just holding our tongues in the whole situation.  My husband wanted another beer.  Ever since Perry ordered our food we never saw him again at the table to ask how everything was.  I told my husband to put the empty glass on the edge of the table maybe he will notice it and walla' he did.  My husband asked for another beer and he went on his way.  At this time our water glasses are now empty.  Well after 10 minutes still no beer has arrived at the table.  By this time the dessert has arrived and my husband and I are sharing a glass of water since we have not been refilled or asked if we wanted any.  Again, we are not saying anything.  We don't ask for much.  We know it is hectic sometimes doing this job.  We were going to let go not getting the beer, but we do like for our water to be filled up WITHOUT having to ask.  So we just asked for the bill and were just going to chalk it up to bad experience and not return.  Until our bill came, the first two charges are for the restaurant week special at 30.14 per person (which is correct).  Then two additional entrees where added and the kicker was he added the beer that never arrived.  Our total check should be in the range of 60+ change, but the total was 122.00.  So that is the point my husband lost it and grabbed the manager.   The manager that night was Sean Fiori whom assisted us.  We explained everything to him expect the experience with the hostess earlier.  We explained our experience with Perry M and his assistant.  We showed him the bill and he immediately apologized and said he will fix the bill and gave us an after dinner drink to make up for not getting the beer.  We are not people to complain.  We put up with a lot from waiters/waitress, but this was awful.  We are simple people and want to be acknowledged and respected and just fill up our drinks every now and then.  Literally he orders our food and gave us the messed up bill.  That was all and wants us to tip you on this service.  Don't get me wrong.  We had no problems with the food, but the service made this experience awful.  Hopefully he gets continued training or he needs to find another profession.",

And it turns out that it was Buddy's place! Cake boss!!! Awesome!! Wait time was an hour, we put our name down and went shopping around to kill time. We got sitted in front of the kitchen. It was awesome to see the cooks say \"yes chef!\" Decoration had whisk, bundt pans, and rolling pins hanging off the ceilings. Cool! Yelpers said the portions are big so bf and I decided to share. No splitting fee. We got the calamari and chicken Parm. The focaccia bread was warm, soft, and perfect. The dipping was olive oil & balsamic vinegar. It was well balanced. Our order was taking soo long. Then our waiter came back with the wrong order for our appetizer. He was so confused. We were confused. He goes back to the kitchen and we hear the head chef get angry and started to yell at the waiter. The manager comes to our table apologize and pays for our appetizer. Great service!! Finally our appetizer arrived! Our calamari was perfect. Lightly battered, soft, and the sauce was great! It wasn't chewy! I hate chewy calamari! Our entree chicken parm was perfect as well. Well seasoned, lightly battered, juicy, thin, and huge!! No room for dessert this time.Next time we will come back and try the dessert too!",

Finally, a bit after 11:30, the gate was rolled back. Second in line, we asked for a table by the windows (remember: empty restaurant). The er, um, \"hostest\" told us that THOSE seats were only for groups of 6 or more. By the time we left, 3 of those tables were occupied (out of about 10), all with parties of 4 or less.  Our waitstaff was attentive, as was the person who filled the water glasses and actually brought out the food. Both orders had been left under a heat lamp too long, and the one order, a pizza, was less than warm. The other order had much to be improved. We will not be returning, nor will we suggest it to out of town guests.",

The not so pleasant manager said they do not sit incomplete parties...are you joking, there were so many open tables!! We said we'd like to be seated to order drinks, they refused. So we waited a few minutes, went back up to the host stand asked if they really couldn't seat us with all the open tables, it seemed a little ridiculous.  Still a very rude no. We left went to another Venetian Italian restaurant, got seated right away.  Will never go back, horrible service. I understand if your busy, but they weren't, just very rude and unaccomadating.",

We got seated pretty quickly without a reservation so it did start off good. We placed our drink order and thats when it all went wrong. We got our drinks but after that did not see our server for 20 min even after asking other workers for him and that we were ready to order. He finally came back and we placed our order. Our appetizers came first and after finishing they cleared the table completely taking all napkins and utensils. The food finally arrived to the table and we all were starving but couldn't start eating because we did not have any utensils to eat with. After asking for our waiter and waiting another 15 minutes and having our food get cold we finally got our waiter and he grabbed the utensils. Finally we told them it was my sister-in-laws birthday so they brought out a cake which was not that good and we sang to her. We then received the check and they charged us $10 for the cake we didn't even eat. Definitely will not be going again.",

    "text": "Looking back at this experience, I'm actually angry. Maybe it deserves a 2, but this is the worst experience I've had on strip, I expected much better. I feel used, dirty. We had a party of 8, 4 couples. I brought 2 bottles of wine (tempranillo and a cab/syrah) intending to pay the corkage fee, which turned out to be $35 (highest I've ever encountered). The waiter said that since we were Seahawks fans and he was too (night before the super bowl) he would waive one of the fees if we tipped him more, more or less, even though he'd rather see us enjoy an Italian wine with dinner.  After examining the wine list we opted for the ones I brought. The waiter also informed us that since we were a big party we should take advantage of an \"appetizer platter\" for us all to share, meats, cheeses and salad, sold to us as a family style Italian sharing experience. We talked it over and all agreed it sounded good. Then we ordered our entrees, 1 couple opted to split the ravioli, my boyfriend ordered the lasagna and I planned on ordering the small margherita pizza so we could share. When I tried to order my margherita the waiter told me it was really small, just an appetizer, I told him I wanted small because I wasn't terribly hungry and didn't want leftovers, he insisted I should get the chicken alla vodka because they had just won an award for it, I asked if it was small, he said \"oh yes, very small\" and gestured with his hands. I caved, and ordered it, after all, I do love pasta and vodka sauce.  Appetizers came shortly after, 2 different salads, 2 meat/cheese/bread platters, calamari, and the meatballs (6). It was all ok, nothing spectacular, but one of the salads was pretty good (it had arugula, yum), and the meatballs were pretty good (nothing compared to Casa di Amore's off-strip though). The entrees came and my pasta was huge (bigger than he implied at least, average dish size for most restaurants though). My noodles were undercooked and the chicken was incredibly dry, sauce was decent, but not enough to make the chicken palatable.  I gave away most of my dish to the couple who split the ravioli, as they were pretty underwhelmed with theirs too, and thought mine was a slight improvement. I took one ravioli in exchange and nibbled my boyfriend's lasagna which was actually pretty amazing (in comparison), meanwhile kicking myself that I didn't just stick with the pizza.  The check came, north of $400, turns out the appetizers were all billed separately, so we should have just ordered what we wanted to begin with.  Looking back I'm convinced that the waiter only wanted me to have the more expensive entree, not the one I'd be happy with, and it angers me that he wouldn't just take my order as I intended. I suppose I've learned my lesson, stay away from gimmicky strip restaurants, stick to your guns, and recognize the upselling. What a swindle, this waiter put used car salesmen to shame, I've never felt more used after a dining experience, and the food was mediocre at best. I'm pretty sure he wasn't really a Seahawks fan either. Buyer beware. We'll stick with Casa in the future.",

Imagine The fun at the end of the night of trying to divide everybody's dinner and then pay separately. But then being told that you can either pay on the all-cash or only on a credit card. thank God we had an accountant with us who could figure out each individual bill and tip. Dinner was very good, my meat was overcooked which they took back and then replaced. I did think they would have discounted my dinner a little bit since I did not get to eat with everybody, however they did not; but I guess it was OK because the food was good. We had two people that had birthdays, which we told them when they asked if it was a special occasion? At the end of the night they brought out two birthday desserts to share. The unfortunate part about this was that they charged us for these desserts which we thought were free since no one asked for anything! All in all the food was good, but the crazy bill rules and being charged for what we thought was a complimentary dessert on top of having my dinner late made it so that I probably wouldn't go back.",

No reservations were needed for lunch and there are many tables. Casual Italian fare of sandwiches, pastas, and some meat dishes. We shared the eggplant starter and each had one of the sandwiches for lunch. The eggplant was okay - presentation was on the sloppy side though. My BLT was nicely presented with grill marks on the bread. Service seemed a bit forced and over cheerful. Food was a little slow to arrive given that it wasn't particularly busy when we arrived.  Overall a-ok but there are much better spots in town for mid-range pricing. The main plus is that it's family friendly if you have kids in tow.",

I guess it is the simple combination of the best ingredients with the presentation skills and technical excellence of a master baker that makes it so good.  This was the only restaurant we visited on or near the strip that didn't seem to be charging a location premium.  It was not inexpensive, but it was reasonable.  Oh-ya, save room for desert OMG!!!!",

My husband and I decided to try Buddy's for Easter dinner today. We started with the calamari which was perfectly fried. I usually prefer red sauce with mine, however, the sauce that came with it was really good. The slices of fried peppers were also a nice touch. For dinner I order the lasagna. It was so delicious and had a lot of great meats in it. I ended up bringing more than half of it home. My husband ordered the chicken parm which came with two large chicken breasts. We each had an iced tea and our bill was $80 and change. We skipped dessert and went across the way to Carlo's",

We went on a Sunday morning (the morning of the Route 91) massacre.    We ordered the brunch buffet (about $35 per person, all you can eat, including pastries), which gave us a large variety of meats, salads, veggies, appetizers, pastas, soups, and of course, pastries. I can't say that this was the best Italian food I've ever had, nor can I say the pastries were phenomenal, but everything was authentic and tasted good. The meatballs definitely lived up to the hyped up reviews. I even enjoyed the \"peel your own\" shrimp.   Price was decent, considering it was owned by the world famous Buddy V. There was also a live band that played in the bar area, creating a really nice atmosphere.",

First, the Nutella Cake is insanely amazing! Everything else was very good as well. Honestly their kids Mac and Cheese was one of all our favorites! It should be available for adults. The meatballs were prefect. Loved the flavor combination of the chopped salad but my 19 year old daughter who likes things simple, thought it was too much. The cheese & Cake, a take on cheesecake was good not super sweet but definitely not the top choice of the three we got.",

Between my husband and I, we had a Caesar salad, a meatball sandwich, and pasta bolognese...the meat sauce was bland, making both the pasta and the sandwich a bore. Another downfall, no fresh bread was served, but instead there were packaged crunchy \"bread\" sticks sitting on the table. Although the location is conveniently located in the middle of everything and the decor cute, the actual food was a disappointment and the cost even more so (+$50 for our 3 item meal!)

We were hold they won an award for Best lasagna in Vegas. I'm not a big lasagna person, but I'll take their word on it.  The service was absolutely top notch from checkin with the hostess and our server, all the way to the two managers that stopped by our table. We were lucky to be seated at a table with the most spectacular view of the strip.   The entire vibe of Buddy V's is just perfection. It's Italian themed with modern contemporary flair. The open bar area with views of the strip impressed me, as did Buddy's music playlist. I found myself using Shazam on many selections. Soulful sounds from Izzy Bizu and Alice Russell to Hiatus Kiayote and Conya Doss permeated throughout the restaurant. This really added to the already wonderful Expedia we were having.  This place definitely deserves five solid stars. I will definitely return.",

Along with the spaghetti that accompanied the chicken I walked away full.   On the first is it to Buddy V's I had the New York strip and my wife had a salad.

The restaurant is nice although it's a little on the dark side at night and a little loud.    I've had the Eggplant Parmigiana and the Chicken Marsala a few times.  The Eggplant Parm is served as an appetizer but it's enough for a meal.  It's good.  I love the Chicken Marsala here.  It's flavorful and tender.  A lot of places don't get Chicken Marsala right but Buddy's does.  My husband gets his usual, Chicken Parmigiana and he likes it.  Service is friendly and really awesome.  Next time, I'd like to try their Happy Hour.    Overall, a great place to get an Italian meal in Vegas.",

    "text": "LOVED this restaurant so much that we're going back for a second time on this extended trip to Vegas! I can't wait because their Bucatini Carbonara is now something I'll be dreaming about forever and attempting to replicate at home.   My husband ordered from the Prix Fixe menu which is $40 per person. He chose the Grandma's Meatballs (which were just okay, sorry Grandma!), the Orecchiette & Italian Sausage (amazing!!!), and since he didn't like any of the dessert choices (either cannoli or tiramisu), our waitress asked the manager if he could substitute in another dessert, and she said yes, for an additional $4. So he ordered the bread pudding for after dinner (pretty good, but extremely filling, so it's more of a shareable dish and I mean for more than 2 people lol). All in all, it could be a pretty good deal, because it shaves a few $'s off of a dessert, if you were planning to get one. We personally wouldn't order from this menu next time, because we simply don't need the dessert after such a satisfying dinner.   For weeks, I had been planning on coming to this restaurant, so I already knew that I would get the Carbonara and it certainly did not disappoint! Based off of a recommendation, I added crumbled Italian sausage and it was all spectacular.    We came in for dinner on a Friday night and made a reservation for 7:15 just in case it was super busy. We arrived early so we sat at the bar and our bartender, Chris, was super friendly and cool. She even went to check on our table for us and told us that it was ready whenever we were! This was easily my favorite restaurant to try over this almost 2-week stay in the Vegas area.",

First off, we were seated by an awesome guy who was very polite. He took our drink order right away and even went over the menu with us. That's where the awesomeness stopped. It took FOREVER for our waitress Valerie to come take our order. When she finally got there, it seemed like she had better things to do. She took the entire order at once down to the desert.  By the time our Ceasar salads came out, we still had not gotten our appetizer. At this time, another couple was seated next to us. There order was taken promptly and there appetizers and entrees came out before ours did. Valerie did not check on our table once. The guy that seated us came back to refill our drinks and give us our appetizer. By this time, the couple next to us had gotten there entrees and were eating already. After about 10 more minutes, we recieved ours.  Now to the food. I ordered the chicken parmigiana. The chicken was over done and dry. The spaghetti was the best part of the entree, but had a strong marinara taste and lack of seasoning. It tasted like a pizza sauce. When we finished, Valarie came back to get our desert order even though we had already given it to her when she decided to get our entire order up front. The tiramisu was good, and the best part of the meal.  We finished our desert and waited another 20 minutes for our check. We decided to pay cash so we wouldnt have to wait for our inattentive waitress any longer. Overall, the people who were seated after us came, ate, and left before we were able to get out of there. A mediocre dinner took about an hour and forty five minutes and was ridiculous. The innatentiveness and lack of service is the reason for the two star review. We probably will go somewhere else next time we are in the mood for Italian.",

I felt very taken care of from the moment we checked-in for our reservation til the moment we left.   This is amazing Italian food that reminds me of family dinners. It feels like it's made with love and care. I got the pre fix dinner. The meatballs were to die for! Everyone was right about these! I shared a Caesar salad and those polenta coupons are some of the tastiest bites I've had of polenta. For my entree I did the chicken parm. The portions are huge and every bite got better and better. Vibrant flavors and fresh ingredients. The presentation was also lovely! I finished off my three course meal with a coffee and a cannoli. Oh wow was I surprised at that cannoli! If you're a coffee drinker I highly suggest pairing it with your dessert.   If you get there early enough in the week, the happy hour looked amazing! Happy hour is only in the bar area though. So make sure you know the hours and ask for happy hour seating.   Our server Andre was excellent in helping us out and was very attentive. The server who helped with waters was always on point and we never went without. So so wonderful!   I'll be back when I'm in town again!",

When she didn't get the table she wanted she was pretty dramatic about it. But, it was her bachelorette weekend. The manager took over and was absolutely amazing. Not only gave her the table she wanted, but was just overall awesome. The food was also great and reasonably priced, especially for Vegas. And when we left we felt like we had a family at Buddy V's . Great deceive and great food.",

The wait was a bit long but there's lots to look at in the area so we walked around for a bit and came back when our table was ready.  The restaurant is located right across of Carlo's bakery which is convenient.  Once seated, I noticed there were some plastic packages in a container on the table. I assumed it was a hand towel but it was actually a package of long thin breadsticks. I munched on this while waiting for our food. I had the spaghetti with shrimp. It was good, but not incredible. But again, I'm not the biggest italian food fanatic. I really loved the garlic bread we ordered though! The pieces were huge and delicious.  Side note: I have seen buddy's show so it was cool to be at his restaurant. We also went to his bakery earlier that day. The restaurant's hostess stand displays buddy's family photo album which I thought was a cute touch.",

It just got worse, the pasta wasn't even fully cooked , some of them are still hard to chew, the chicken was so try that it's hard to finish, and the saucy, sorry, the white salty water in side of my pasta.... this makes me wonder how did they even get this man good reviews.. and the service was okay, just one of the receptionist didn't want to be there at all.

The calamari was delicious and was nice and crispy, and I always go for the deep fried jalapeno pieces. For my main dish I ordered the salmon which was cooked perfectly and was light enough for me to leave room for the Italian birthday cake for dessert. The cake was nice and moist but it was very hard to eat for how it was served.",

Live music was very entertaining, playing all the oldies with a drummer and a singer/pianist.    Food wise, can't go wrong with anything you order here.  Everything is just fresh and piping hot.  Seafood is immaculate, meatball are succulent, desserts just melt your arteries and bread is bread.  Wine is expensive obviously but what do you expect.  I'd come back again to entertain guests or just grab a good italian food fit for a tradeshow attendee.  Their birthday cake is made out of diabetes so it's really good.",

    "text": "Good! Was it great? Was it the best Italian style dinner that I've ever had? Was it worth $100 with tip (no booze) for two? No. No and no.  BUT it was good.  It just mostly  fell very short on the service and overall feel of the place.  We were seated off the bar area,  near a window looking out at Senor Frogs - not really the vibe we were going for.  There seemed to be a cozier dining area and one more suitable for a couple celebrating an anniversary- which was disclosed in the open table app. The bus staff was clumsy and inattentive. Our sever lacked even forced sincerity.  Whoever brought our food was hurried and had no idea who ordered what. That's just not okay service at this price point.  It's just not.    So yes, service was insincere and inexperienced. We would have liked to ask for more bread, but our bread plates and oil were whisked away before we could even think that we might want more than a small square of the delicious bread!  Appetizers came out very fast - the caprese salad was fresh and delicious! It was beautifully season with gorgeous cracked pepper.  That grilled bread was a touch too charred for me, but absolutely edible and tasty.  The meatballs - generous portion and good! The best ever - no! We enjoyed them though.   My husband went with the scampi and it was very good, nice complex, yet subtle in flavor - the winner of our entrees.  I went with the orecchiette and sausage - the description reminded me of a favorite dish of mine - and while it was good - it wasn't anything extraordinary.  I adore a simple, comfort dishes and sure, it was good, but it missed the mark by being a touch too dry.  The roasted tomatoes were absolutely a definite star of the dish.  It just needed a little something to pull it together. I had to work hard to make a perfect bite each time I stuck my fork in the dish.  I don't want to have to work that hard for a $20+ dish of pasta.  I want the last bite to be as delicious as the first.    For the price point of everything - Vegas considered - I expected there to be a much larger degree of wow here.  It was all good, fresh, well portioned - but it was nothing over the top extraordinary and service and seating and overall feel of the place - at least where we were seated -left so much to be desired.  I know next to nothing on the celebrity chef here - it was the Yelp reviews that drew us in and I'm feeling a bit misled.    Note to restaurant- treat every table like it's the first time a couple has been able to celebrate a kid-free anniversary getaway in seven years.",

    "text": "Was brought by my wife as a surprise while in Vegas.  It was great dinner date night setting.  Its got a classic casual Italian and high end experience all wrapped up in one place.  Overall the place seemed to accommodate a good mix of family friendly atmosphere while still being nice enough for a one on one date night.  The menu is a mix of dishes all with a family vibe.  We started with Aunt Nina's Mozzarella En Carozza which was good.  The breading was a little flaky made it slightly less easy to handle, but was overall good.  Would have probably tried something else in retrospect, but it wasn't bad by any means.  I had My Dad's Bucatini Carbonara which is one of my go to Italian dishes.  Immediately jumped off the menu at me as was as fantastic as I can recall as I've had anywhere else.  The ingredients tasted freshly prepared and the pasta was delicious.  I would have this any day and be completely satisfied.  At the end they brought out a Cannoli as a nice birthday surprise which we didn't ask for, but was welcomed and eaten down to the last bite.  If you like desserts and Cannoli's then this is a must for you.  My only slight downgrade is for a Vegas vibe.  It feels a bit like a mall/casino setting from the outside, but that's what you're going to get in Vegas so you should really expect that instead of a small time / local place you may get in other cities.   If you placed this restaurant anywhere outside of the Vegas strip and I may be inclined for a 5 star experience, but it was nothing to significantly detract from the overall experience.",

They also give you focaccia bread with balsamic and vinegar so good!!   We didn't try any big pasta dishes since we were eating our way through Vegas and wanted to save some room, but i would def come back here!! All the food was delicious and smelled great. We had a good server & the vibe was nice in the bar area, love the lounge type couches they had! I also got a birthday cannoli with pistachio and choc chips...  perfect dessert",

As usual, another benefit of Yelp is doing a quick search and relying upon fellow Yelper's to point me in the right direction!  I had one of the best plates of lasagna in recent memory and the photo I took and am attaching with this review attest.   Perfect sauce, heat and layers of fresh and flavorful awesomeness.   So good that those who follow Anthony Bourdain and those who are with Guy Fieri would appreciate it.  The bread to start was perfect warm crunchiness and the cheese plate was incredible-really tasty pecorino and a solid gorgonzola.  My wife's rigatoni with vodka sauce was tasty.  Attentive service in a relaxed atmosphere with a great view facing the strip at night.",

I celebrated my mom's bday early here and service was beyond exceptional. We 5 of us were seated in a booth, dinner was about to begin, it was a Sunday but eating here made it feel like we were really away on vacation. The calamari was well seasoned, not too much battered, and crispy. We had Moretti's and it went well with our meals. I love Italian food and the pasta was cooked perfectly and not too al dente.  For us cali drivers, a heavy meal is not the way to go before heading home. Plus the 100 degree weather doesn't help so much. We were stuffed and with to go boxes. They gave us a little cute cookie plate for dessert. I want to come back here for a romantic dinner next trip. Thank you Buddy V's!!",

The atmosphere was fun but not so loud that you couldn't carry on a conversation. The food was reasonably priced, delicious and the staff was friendly and accommodating. We also loved live music. Nicolas Cole on vocals and keyboard with a drummer played and sang some of our favorite old songs. We even danced when he played a song we requested. Great fun!",

Nicholas Cole is phenomenal and he played tunes that made the dinner experience more exhilarating. It was truly incredible for Nicholas to do a warm introduction with every table and because of which we were able to put down some song requests which he performed with such grace and passion. We love food and music and Nicholas along with his band paired with the delicious food made this night thoroughly enjoyable. Loved this place period !!!!",

The food was amazing from grands meatballs to egg frittata and red velvet cake. We went for brunch and between both of us tasted all we could with no complaints at all. The service was great and everything tasted homemade from family recipes. We didn't eat again the rest of the day and there was something for everyone (except fish) since its Italian. I do have a suggestion though: If you are eating at Buddy's how about providing a menu for the pastry shop across the way and having those to go orders ready and waiting. Having to wait in line shouldn't be something you have to do if you have already splurged on the meal. Pricey but worth it. Reservations recommended'",

    "text": "We enjoyed the Caprese appetizer, sea bass, and lasagna entrees!  Our waiter recommended the caprese and we wondered if we should have ordered so much food until it arrived and we tasted it to determine that it was the best we've ever had!  The flavors were interesting with what looked like white grape tomatoes, heirloom tomatoes and sooo delicious and creamy buratta cheese. The sea bass was cooked to perfection with crispy and buttery edges. The arugula salad was divine with the fish. My mouth waters thinking of it as I write this! Our waiter recommended the Pino Grigio which was perfect. My husband had lasagne and an Italian dark beer that our waiter recommended. Once again spot on recommendation. The lasagne was a bit spicy with just the right amount of sauce. Focaccia was light and hot and perfect! We asked for bread to go with the leftover lasagne we brought back and they gave us 4 generous pieces. No dessert, although I'm sure it would have been wonderful, especially the cake with canolli filling. We will return!  Just a couple of notes: Dinner for 2 with tip was $120.  Definitely worth the cost!! There is not a convention in town and I don't recall a time in the last 40 years when I've been in Vegas and it's been so quiet. We walked in to sit at a window seat that we requested.",

    "text": "Not a bad experience, but definitely didn't meet my expectations. I'm a Cake Boss fanatic and have stood in line for hours to get in to Carlos Bakery in Hoboken when it was the only location, so Buddy V's was a no brainer.   A long line outside the bakery across the hallway, but no wait for the restaurant, possibly just because it was FILLED with exhaust/smoke. They assured us it was not normally that way and let us pick our table in the least-smoky area of the restaurant, which overall got better as we went. Not sure what the issue was.  The octopus salad was super small, so I was glad I wasn't that hungry. More so, the octopus smelled like tuna in a can. I've never had octopus that smelled bad, and almost didn't eat it, but took a chance. The special Cake Boss dessert cocktail was strong, gross, and the red velvet crumbs on top weren't even red.   There are two cakes on the dessert menu, and we got both. The chocolate cake was underwhelming, but the Italian Birthday Cake.... oh my gosh amazing. Is this really what Italian Birthday Cake is like? We have been DOING. IT. WRONG. Chocolate ganache filling AND cannoli filling, covered with mounds of fresh whipped cream, sliced almonds. Definitely Top 5-10 desserts of my life.  Our waiter Charlie was very nice, but he was overbooked it seemed as it took 12 minutes for someone to take our drink order, and we often waited and waited just to have someone walk by so we could grab their attention. I also asked him 3 separate times to bring the check before he did.   It all felt extremely, extremely overpriced, too. $100 for 2 entrees, a cocktail, and 2 desserts, that mostly were not very good? Meh.   Pro-tip to you people standing in line at the bakery: if the dessert you're planning on ordering there is on the Buddy V's restaurant dessert menu... why are you waiting? Order it here. (But skip the food.)",

Husband had chicken parm said it was good and had lots of flavors going on as well. Chicken was not dry. Had the Caesar salad was saving room for dessert. Salad was good and just the right amount. Desserts are awesome. Must have is the tiramisu the lady fingers are on the side and you dip them in the mason jar of stuff.

The bus boy came around to clear off the table and he said they do have a smaller 12oz version without the stupid souvenir glass for which we weren't given the option.  Then for dinner my daughter asked for a white pasta instead of the kids spaghetti. Waiter said he could do a kids Alfredo. Come the bill was a charge for a $20 Alfredo when the other kids entrees were $12. We had to ask the manager which quickly took care of the problem.  I personally ordered a Caesar salad and as the waiter walked away he said he would being enough to share. Bill comes and were being billed for a huge family portion for which 2 people ate and more than half was left.  The cocktail we ordered was too sweet and liquor. We could have got a better value and experience and mastros for the cost paid. We dine out 3-4 times a week and know the routine of value, quality, service and overall customer appreciation. This place provided NONE!   The overall experience sucked, service sucked and we were left feeling like we were takin advantage of.  Steer clear of this over priced and over rated restaurant.",

I was having trouble deciding between the scallops and the chicken parm, she recommended the chicken parm and assured me that in case I didn't like it that I could order something else.   But she was right! The chicken parm was delicious! I personally don't like chicken, but this was juicy and crunchy, covered with hot marinara sauce and cheese covering it all.  It also came with spaghetti marinara on the side.   My friend was jealous and wish she had gotten mine. She ordered the seabass, which was flaky and good  too, but I still liked mine better.",

I rarely give a restaurant 5 stars on Yelp, but Buddy V's is well deserving. Don't hesitate making reservations. Incredible!",

She finally takes our order. The food was good not great. Wanted to place a desert order but when no one comes back to take your order how can you.!!Finally waved down the Manger to pay out. Pricey place for such Terrible Service.!",

(Found out later that they are connected) My friends and I had already decided on Mexican food for dinner but I wandered over to look at the menu and inquire about the wait time. As soon as I walked in I was in heaven! It smelled amazing! The prices weren't bad and the hostess sad she could seat our party of 4 right now so I went ahead and followed her to a table (with an incredible view of the strip!) I never went back to my friends... I just texted them and told them we had a change of plans and would now be eating Italian at Buddy V's! We told our server, Casey, we had reservations and were kind of in a rush. She was fantastic and told us which dishes to avoid because of a longer cook time and made a few recommendations on dinner and wine. We ordered Salmon, spaghetti bolognese, chicken piccata and ravioli and all four of us loved our dishes. As promised, Casey had us out of there in under an hour and we made it to the show with time to spare! Great food, great service, great views & I can't wait to go back! Next time I'm ordering dessert because they looked delicious as well!",

Grrrr!  After getting the waiter to confirm, use the Palazzo Valet, but it's still a little trek.   The waiter was super friendly and nice, even when I returned my soda, because it had a funny smell. I promise it wasn't me...I made half the table confirm it smelled bad.   I asked the waiter what was good and he said many things. I mentioned the chicken parm, because so many people on yelp ordered it, and he said that was a good option. So I went for it.  Buyers remorse!!  It was decent, don't get me wrong, but the guy across from me got a burger that looked amazing!!!  Who would have thunk it...a burger at an Italin joint?!  Next time!  The parm was ok, and most would probably love it, but I am super picky about my sauce, being raised in an Italian pasta sauce making family. It did have two big pieces of chicken, fried well, and not dry with ample cheese on top. I wouldn't throw it away, but it wasn't OMG, I am ordering this again.  I already know I will be ordering the burger next time. :P  I also wish I had room for the lobster tail dessert, but I just don't. :(  I would come back again, because I think this place could make me happy.  Just not a good start with the strange soda this time.",

The room was nice, but you really want a booth, as the tables had very uncomfortable-looking, unpadded chairs. Service was scattered and disorganized. Our server, Kacie, while very nice, seemed to be kinda all over the place, we had just sat down when she asked us if we were ready to order (??) and the bread service didn't arrive til after the entrees were served -- disappointing, as the restaurant had been open for long enough to smooth out those kinds of issues.  On the bright side, the food was excellent, we started with the meatballs, which were surprisingly light and tasty, with a nicely seasoned red sauce. I had the whole wheat penne pasta with pesto and veggies, delicious with a lot of flavor but still light. Hubby had the shrimp scampi with perfectly cooked shrimp and angel hair pasta and a light and flavorful sauce.   The prices were pretty good for Vegas so we felt we had a good value, but it was really too bad that the overall experience didn't match the quality of the food. With so many options in Vegas, I doubt we would be back.",

We started off with the mozzarella sandwich in marinara sauce which was pretty good. Very hearty and pleasantly seasoned. Then my wife ordered the chicken parm which she enjoyed. I ordered the meatball sub, I know what your thinking \"meatball sub how can you judge off of that\" well the waitress told me it was a signature and it sounded good for lunch. Well my take on the sub was the bread was great, a little butter action with the melted mozzarella, but the meatballs were not so good. The texture was not there for me, it was like the microwaveable meatballs, honestly if you blind folded me and but a subway sub in comparison I would probably pick the subway sub.",

I'm a huge fan who occasionally watches episodes of Cake Boss and dreams about going to Hoboken to taste his food.  So when I heard about Buddy V's Ristorante during this recent birthday trip, my heart skipped a beat and I told my husband we HAD TO go!  From the outside, the charming decor mimicked that of a quaint cafe nestled in the corner of somewhere in Italy (or so I'd think, since I've never been).  It drew me in!  I love how it felt homey yet upscale inside.  We had a reservation and were seated promptly.  Our food took a while to arrive but the taste more than made up for it!  I ordered Nonna's Lasagna.  Oh my!  It was as if I've never had lasagna before!  There were so many layers with meat and cheese that just melt on your tongue.  That good!  I wished my stomach were bigger just so I could have more of that lasagne.  It was a very generously portioned dish.  My husband ordered Mama's Style Chicken.  He loved his dish too!    Oh and don't get me started on the dessert!  Lisa's Warm Nutella Cake was perfect for my birthday treat - chocolate cake drizzled in chocolate sauce with caramel ice cream.  Scrumptious, to say the least!  They decorated with \"happy birthday\" and our server sang to me in Italian.  It was the perfect ending to a perfect meal.  The customer service was amazing.  Our server was funny and accommodating.  We had our baby with us and enjoyed a memorable dinner out.  What more could you ask for in Vegas?!  Definitely one for the books!",

To start the lobster tail (dessert) could make a grown man cry of joy, I literally would have been happy to stick a straw in it and suck out all the cream out instead of actually ordering a meal (Which is what I did the following day, pretty sure i gained about 10lbs just off of lobster tail filling)  Enough about the dessert (I'll be talking more about it more when I write my Carlos Bakery review, yes it was that good!) The entrees are not something to overlook either. Let me start out by saying I am a somewhat food snob when it comes to classier restaurant. While I have left some places questioning the quality based on what I paid this is certainly not one of those times. As far as Italian food goes it doesn't get much better, the quality is spectacular and there is nothing that I would have changed. To top it off the portions were HUGE! Being a guy in his early 20's of course I forced myself to eat every bite. However most people would have probably took half of it to go.  If you are ever in Las Vegas do yourself a favor and stop by Buddy V's for dinner.",

It's difficult to find a restaurant on the strip that has character, good food, and great service. Buddy V's has all three. We made reservations on a weekday evening and the restaurant was about 3/4 full. The ambiance was casual with an upscale Italian vibe; translation: fine dining without leaving a hole in your pocket. Win Win. There were two people taking care of our table, so we got double the attention and service. Both our waiter and waitress were friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered \"My Wife's Eggplant Parm\" as an appetizer and chicken rigatoni alla vodka and Nonna's lasagna al forno as our mains.   My Wife's Eggplant Parm- clever! I like how Buddy gives cred to those who deserve it. The eggplant parm was pretty much a tower of crispy goodness. Eggplant, melted mozzarella, tomato parm, eggplant, melted mozzarella, tomato, parm...you get the picture. The eggplant was had a nice crunch and the melty cheese and tart tomato sauce were a delicious combo. I'm using to a more traditional baked eggplant parm as opposed to the deep fried dish that was served. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but I was missing the deep flavors of the eggplant that was fried away.   Chicken rigatoni alla vodka- rigatoni, pancetta, grilled chicken swimming in a decadent tomato cream sauce was heaven. I really enjoyed the creaminess of this dish. The sauce was a perfect combination of flavors (it's all about the sauce). This pancetta was a nice touch of smokiness. Super filling, you will have leftovers!   Nonna's lasagna al forno- YES. CHEESY, MEATY, traditional lasagna with a ton of flavor. This hefty lasagna had Italian sausage, beef and pork, ricotta cheese, mozzarella, provolone and parmesan baked to perfection. Four types of cheeses people. It was cheesy. If you are looking for a classic and delicious lasagna, look no further. The only thing I was missing was a bit of sweetness in the tomato sauce. Otherwise, I would absolutely order this item again. Totally big enough to split.   I truly enjoy traditional Italian food. Big portions, big flavors and lots of sauce. Warning, you will be in a food coma after you finish your meal. Come with an empty belly and be prepared to eat. We had a ton of leftovers which is what should happen when you go out for Italian food. I enjoyed the decor of the restaurant, the ambiance, as well as the service. We let our waitress know that we were on a time crunch, and she got us in and out of the restaurant in no time with full bellies and smiles on our faces. This restaurant was closer to Palazzo then Venetian and somewhat of a mission to find, but we found it and we were glad we did. A very solid option of casual Italian food in the heart of LV.",

Had cannoli, Italian wedding cake, and three scoops gelato of different flavors. Cannoli was in a greasy shell that tasted like Mexican fried ice cream shell and cheese was more like whipped cream, not even mascarpone. Wedding cake was cold and also similar cheap greasy flavor. Gelato had not enough flavor for \"gelato\". Top that off with Vegas pricing and slowest service in Vegas, plus people smoking freely where we were sitting, so will not be back.",

While waiting to get a table, I hung out in the bar area which was very spacious and had great waitresses. I had a Moscow mule, it was pretty decent.   They got us a table in 35 minutes, which was exactly what they estimated. I got a Caesar side salad, which was decent. I wasn't super fond of the croutons. We also got garlic cheese bread, which was very tasty.   My main dish was eggplant parmesan, with a side of spaghetti. I really enjoyed the eggplant, it was presented very nice as well. I also liked the spaghetti sauce. Since it was my birthday, they brought me a delicious birthday dessert. I must say, it was probably one of the best desserts I have ever had!",

First impression are the female hosts who check you in and take you to your table. They were all very nice, but they all really looked like they were from New Jersey (have you watched Cake Boss or Real Housewives of New Jersey?!) Sorry, I digress.  We ordered the antipasto Grandma's meatballs (the waiter said you'd get 5, our group got 6-no complaints there!); the Lisa V's linguine & white clam sauce (I still purr from the wine and virgin olive oil-tasted like butter); the chicken rigatoni alla vodka (the plate was licked up); and the orecchiette and italian sausage (this one-not so good). While we waited we received a small piece of focaccia bread each (why couldn't we have more slices??) with olive oil and balsamic vinegar (ya-ummm, but why couldn't we have more slices?? And I would've preferred more vinegar...) One of us requested a side caesar salad (not on the menu, but provided) and instead of croutons it was cubes of polenta (yummy). I suggest you should ask \"what is the meal favorite here?\", so you won't be disappointed.  We opted for dessert across the way at Carlos' Bakery, which is slightly (read my review for the bakery thus my use of the word \"slightly\") a mistake because I really wanted to try the butterscotch creme brulee.",

But our food was delicious and the service was A++++. We had the mozzarella en carozza which was tasty with a chunky tomato sauce and pesto; delicious, but more like a glorified grilled cheese than the carozza I'm used to on the east coast. The complimentary homemade bread was great though. We also had the veal marsala and chicken penne alla vodka and both were GREAT. I was also pleased with the portion of everything; they weren't gluttonous but large enough for a small leftovers meal. I'd suggest it to anyone going to Vegas, but with SO MANY restaurants on the strip, I don't think it's a \"must visit\" if you're only there for a short time. Staying 4+ days? Add it to the list.",

My husband had the Lasagna --- this man is hard to please--- and even he raves about it!  I had the Spaghetti Bolognese, it was delicious!  Would have loved to have dessert, but too stuffed!  We will not hesitate to visit Buddy Vs again!  2 thumbs up!",

    "text": "So lazy. That's part of my Vegas living. I don't want to go too far for food. Luckily this was a short walk away from where I was staying at the Venetian  What I ate:  - Cheese and charcuterie plate: I love cheese, I love charcuterie. Why wouldn't you enjoy this? Great to share. My friends didn't like the blue cheese, but I gobbled it all up! - Chicken rigatoni alla vodka: Plenty of large chicken pieces, flavorful sauce. This was just a tad on the salty side. The rigatoni were perfectly al dente! - Buddy's special pizza: Dough was fresh and flavorful, the toppings were delicious. I was glad I stole a slice from my friend and tried it  Pros: - Easy access from the strip, located in the venetian shops - Ten min walk from venetian hotel - Great food - Service was nice - Plenty of room for large or small parties. I watched staff bring together tables for groups of 10, and quickly break it down for smaller parties - loved the open kitchen - you can definitely get some of their famous desserts without having to wait in like across the hall at their bakery - Lots of bright light and space  Cons: - can be confusing to find if you've never been there - Lots of bright light. If you're nursing a hangover, this may not be the place for you. Order the pasta/pizza to go and eat it in the dark cave of your hotel room  Would I come again? Sure",

    "text": "Buddy V's a fantastic place for some huge Italian dishes.  We have visited Buddy's 4 times now, and each experience has been the same great service and consistent quality of food.  Located in the Palazzo/Venetian Canal Shops, it has a strip side view, and big windows to make a nice bright and open restaurant.  The entree portions are very large and typically can be served in a family style, so everyone has a chance to sample a number of dishes.  The fresh baked bread is a nice start to the meals, and the dinner starter Caesar salad is fairly small in comparison to the entrees.  One go-to dish is definitely  Nonna's Lasagna, which is a wonderful mixture of meats and lots of cheese.  The Veal Milanese, which is a lighter version of Veal Parmesan, using a mix greens/tomatoes as the topping was very good.  Hints for you visit: Make reservations, as prime times fill quickly!  Request a table by the window for a strip side view, or you can sit on the \"patio\" for people watching inside the Canal walkways.  And, plan on large portions for the entrees, if you have a desire for dessert.",

So of course on my recent trip to Vegas, I had to come back! As expected, the service was great! Once again, I ordered their Fettucini Alfredo pasta dish with added shrimp. The flavors were all there, however, it kind of dry (lack of sauce) and the noodles were more al dente than previously. I would give 5 stars, but due to the meal not meeting the expectations of the first I'll, unfortunately, have to drop my rating to a 4. However, I will be back on my next visit and hopefully, I'll be able to give them a 5 star.",

I loved everything we tried except the strawberry lemonade which tasted like Hi-C.   The lasagna was great, but the superstar dish is the My Mother-In-Laws Linguine Shrimp Pasta.   HOLY FREAKIN' COW!  Damn delicious! I had intended on splitting it with my partner who ordered the lasagna but ended up eating it entirely on my own. It was too good to share!  The pasta tasted fresh and the fresh lemony sauce was to die for. Oh, and the prawns! HUGE!  Please do yourself a favor and try this one.   (I would've taken a picture but it looked so delicious I just jumped right in.)  Overall, I had a fantastic lunch at Buddy V's and will happily dine there again next time I'm in Vegas.",

The best Garlic bread I ever had and my meatball sandwich was delish. My wigs margarita pizza was average. The problem I had was Happy hour is from 3-6pm, we were unaware of that and nobody told us. We had reservations at 3pm. After ordering and eating our apps, we noticed another table with some good looking slider (I love sliders) that were not on our menu. Turns out there is a Happy Hour menu. The prices are awesome and have different food from the regular menu. Our bill was $70+ if we ordered from the happy hour menu it would have been half of that. The manager came over and offered nothing but a \"I'm sorry\". Moral of the story, ask for the happy hour menu when you come here between 3 & 6pm.",

The garlic bread was also yummy and each piece of bread served is big enough to split between two people to share. Cheesey and garlicky - it was an amazing combo. I got the carbonara but tried the friends Bolognese spaghetti and both were really delicious. If I come here next time I'm in Vegas I would probably order the spaghetti bc it's the best I've ever had while eating out. The cocktails are meh which is why I gave 4 stars, I tried 2-3 and I didn't really think they were anything special or worth paying for. But otherwise everything else was on point!

She knew the menu by heart and made some excellent recommendations and answered all our questions. We decided to order the cucumber mule, the \"my wife's eggplant parm\" and the \"grandma's meatballs\". The drink was ok but that's not we were here for, the food was excellent! I am normally not a fan of eggplant Parmesan but I went with Valerie our server's recommendation and this did not disappoint at all! I absolutely loved the presentation but more so how good it tasted! The crunchiness was excellent. The meatballs were delicious too. I was so full after just these!

    "text": "First time there.  We had a certificate, it was an anniversary and we love Italian food, so it was opportunity to check out Buddy's place.  We started with Buddy's Caprese, which is made with Burrata cheese.  Creamy inside, firm outside, delicious all the way.   We then as Cheese Ravioli and The Lasagna.  Great sauces flavors, and the herbs used in the sauces added a nice herby touch.  The meats used in the lasagna included a spicy Italian sausage.  That was it.  The other flavors fell in line.  The Italian Wedding Cake we had for dessert was Wow!  The cannoli filling was a great touch.  For service, it was good as it gets.  We were greeted promptly and seated promptly.  Our server was right on top of us being seated.  From offering to take an order for drinks and appetizers, to being there to answer menu questions, to taking the order, he was right there.  He came back to ask us about or order, how it tastes, and tell us little things about what we ordered, he was attentive, but not smothering.  They definitely train their staff very well.  We observed other servers acting the same way.  From greeting to returning our paid bill, our server was polite, funny, informative and top notch.  Our server experience alone was worth the visit.  We'll be back since there are many more items to explore.",

The portion sizes are amazing for the price, the food is delicious (who doesn't love perfectly cooked Italian cuisine), the ambience is cute and the service is excellent. I sat at the bar where Jason was bartending. He knows his cocktails and you can tell he enjoys his job. He found a way to build a connection with everyone sitting at the busy bar.

Tiramisu was deconstructed and not my favorite way to have it-also a very small dessert. Still, tasted very good.

We both were craving some good Italian food, and decided to come by Buddy V's for dinner. The menu had so many options, and the prices were so reasonable, so why not? Fancy restaurants on the strip are usually SO OVER PRICED, with sucky food. So we were a bit nervous. But this was not like any other place there!!   I ordered the Chicken Parmesan which was so freaking delicious. I can't even explain it. The chicken melted in your mouth, it was perfection. We also ordered the cheese ravioli- amazing!! The portion size was so big, we easily could have shared one dish. But we ended up eating everything.   They also serve complimentary bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar before your entrees arrive. It was a great experience, ambiance was great, and we got a beautiful window seat to enjoy the view outside. I would definitely recommend!!!",

The first time was for a late Sunday brunch, but we just got there too late for the buffet brunch, which looked really good. Gonna definitely have to come back for that some time.  Me and my date tried the salumi plate, which was pretty good, especially since it came with crispy grilled baguette slices. Schmeared some of the blue cheese on a slice and then layered the salumi and prosciutto for a nice little open face mini-sammy. Yum! I ordered the chicken parm, which came with a side of spaghetti marinara and my date ordered the caesar salad and we split them both between us, which was more than enough food since the caesar was pretty good size and the chicken parm came with two equal sized filets covered with cheese and sauce. The caesar came with polenta croutons, which were amazing and would have been a great appetizer on their own with a side of red sauce! Crispy on the outside and warm and fuzzy in the middle. Almost took away from how good the caesar was. My date thought there was too much dressing, but I like it that way. The chicken parm was awesome! Probably the best I've ever had anywhere. Good thick tender piece of chicken, nice breading, and great cheese to chicken ration with a nice marinara on top. But the coup de grace was the unassuming side of pasta on the dish. I don't know what it was, but it was just spaghetti marinara but the size and texture of the pasta was just amazing. It was like the unknown actor stealing the spotlight from all the big name actors in a movie!   I went back for lunch later in the week and got the Express lunch for $22 which included a 3 course selection. I got the caesar, spaghetti bolognese, and lemon sorbet. All were awesome, expecially for the price. But the spaghetti again was amazing. And the bolognese sauce was nice and thick and held to the pasta like glue. Easily the best spaghetti dish I've ever had. Again, I don't know what it was about the pasta (size? texture? taste? perfectly al dente?) but it was like crack in pasta form. I can't wait to go back! And this is from a guy who try's not to eat pasta much because it's a carb bomb. And I don't think I've ever had a more perfectly balanced sorbet. Not too sweet, not too tart (lemon sorbet). And 2 big scoops! What a great way to finish the meal and cleanse the pallet!  Well done, Buddy V! Well done!",

This place was honestly not the first place we had picked to go for dinner that day, but some how we ended up there and we were not disappointed! The service to begin with is AMAZING. Our server told us that one lasagne would be good for the 3 of us, but we were being naive and didn't want to believe it. So we got 3 lasagnes, because of the high praise from the other staff as well. Our server was not joking, that lasagne is one plate you might never finish in one sitting. All three of us finished only about a quarter of our lasagnes before we were stuffed to our eye balls. We literally couldn't move. But it was so delicious, form the sauce to the meat and the cheese! They also make fantastic drinks and offer great insight on the various dishes. The restaurant offers great views, and even though we didn't get to try it, we heard the high praise of their cheese cake!  TLDR: Get one lasagne for 3 people, you will all be stuffed!",

    "text": "My friend and I went here because our flight landed earlier, and we wanted to find a decent restaurant to eat in. We got there at around 4 and ordered a meatball sub and caprese salad.   I didn't like how they didn't give us bread but instead some type of cracker. We were hungry, so we munched on until we saw our entrees.  The meatball sub was decent looking with seasoned fries. The fries were tasty, but the meatball sub wasn't worth the money. It was tiny and tasted like it had been heated in the microwave. It was still passable if it was about $10.  The caprese salad was not worth the $16 we paid. From left to right were a whole tomato, a small blob of caprese, about 12 cherry tomato halves drenched in dressing, and a spinach leaf. It was the tiniest salad I've ever eaten. Wasn't that good and definitely not worth the money.  If you're hungry and don't want to spend over $30 for two people, try somewhere else!",

I judge Italian restaurants by their sauce and their meatballs. I know both being from the Philly/NJ/NY area. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. I was served a very generous, steaming portion. The presentation was lovely. It was very fresh. The meatballs were outstanding. Firm, flavorful and delicious. The spaghetti was perfectly al dente, and the sauce was as if it came from an Italian grandmother's kitchen. The service was very very good. Friendly, knowledgable and attentive to any need. Bravo Buddy Valastro!",

Our server, which I don't remember his name and upset that I can't give him some recognition was just awesome. Attentive with personality. Made our dining experience fun, but still classy. Our food was delicious. My hubby and I shared the chicken Marsala. So much flavor and cooked to perfection. Drinks from the bar were made perfectly. Just an overall wonderful night. Oh and by the way we were a party of 8 with separate checks. No problems at all. Thank you Buddy V's for making our birthday celebration just absolutely PERFECT!",

The ceasar salad was super good and had polenta croutons. Our attendant (not the waiter) was AWESOME! He kept our waters full, and came by with more bread. Our waiter, was just okay. He was super chatty with other tables, and he tried to up-sell everything. Kind of felt a little pushy at times. Overall, we had a great time. Just had a horrible view of the Trump tower when we went but a cool view of the Strip. Ain't nobody wants to look at that tower while they're dining. But that's just my opinion.",

Then came Nona's Lasagna Al Forgo. They gave it to us in 2 separate dishes which made it a lot easier to share. The portion size was extremely generous especially for lunch. But we felt that it was very similar in taste to Grandma's Meatballs. Maybe ordering similar sauce dishes wasn't the right decision.",

The food is Great and the service is excellent.  Our waitress yesterday was I believe Graciela and she did an excellent 5 star job !  Nuggs had the classic cheese pizza.. of course.. and although the presentation was nice the sauce tasted like it was straight from the can (in my opinion).  It did not compliment the pizza at all and I could only compare it to what would seem like Hunts canned tomato sauce accompanied with good pizza dough and cheese.  My friend had the Chicken Parm , and I had the Bucatini Carbonara which I hoped I spelled correctly.  Definitely NO complaints on those two dishes!  I would definitely try those if you are not sure what to get.  Cheesy Goodness accompanied with the subtle flavor of bacon and texture of what seemed to be bread crumbs in the Bucatini are going to have me coming back in July for a double order!  Super deliciousness! My only sadness is that for 23.00 nugget stole most of it from me and there wasn't enough for me.  It's a portion size designed for an average person I would imagine but being that I'm on the bit larger side of the spectrum I could have eaten two plates easily.  Chicken Parm with spaghetti was demolished by my friend so I would imagine that should tell you how good it was.  The Cheese board is also a good add to your list of things to get while you are here.  Great selection of meats and cheeses but the bread was not enough for the amount on the board. Desserts I might have to say are phenomenal !  I would have to say a best choice would be the Nutella cake and ice cream.  I say this only because after our meal the nugget had finished most of her pizza and half of my pasta so when I asked her if she wanted a dessert she replied NO.  I received my nutella cake and after having one bite I asked her again .. Are you sure?  It's nutella cake.. and the result about dessert is in my picture for this place.",

The service was awesome and they were on top of the drinks and the refills. Although we didn't have children with us, there was a specific section for children's Foods like chicken fingers, Etc and desserts. This is our second time humor and we will be back.",

I believe our servers name was Georgio? Not positive on the name but he was spectacular! SUPER friendly, helped us find great drink and food choices based on what we were looking for. Answered  every question we had thoroughly, he was quick and effiecient, even made us laugh and took a picture for us before we left! Of course knowing this is the 'Cake Boss' restaurant, needless to say the dessert was on point. The drinks...they were certainly not messing around with a lack of alcohol but it wasn't so much to ruin the flavor of the drink! With their current special, depending on what drink you get, you can take the glass home. Overall lovely experience and I wish we had on in Kansas City!",

We ordered the sausage and pepper sliders, mac n cheese and Italian birthday cake. And we were very pleased with our order. The sliders tasted like what you would expect typical sausage and peppers, but tasty. Mac n cheese had chicken and veggies, which is more like a entree versus what most Americans think of it being a side dish.  Service was standard and considering we sat at the bar I've never had a bartender treat me poorly, but I must admit she was kind of awkward towards us. Lastly, the Italian birthday cake was really moist, but not dippy. I can't wait to come here again and try the Chicken Parmigiana, a customer next to us ordered this and it looked delicious. I highly recommend Buddy V's to anyone especially if you're at Venetian already.",

We asked to sit at a booth after finding the chairs too slippery and uncomfortable. When we asked to sit at booth it was like we bothered her.   Once we got to sit down we were promptly served by a great busboy. Our waiter was Rocco.  He did a great job. We were talking and were not quite ready to make our order just yet but the rude hostess came over took all menus but one and said we could share? Does this place not have enough menus?   The food was ok. I got the angus burger on brioche and others got pasta items off the menu also said it was ok but not for price. Fries were not savory. It was just ok and overpriced.   In the past I have tried the zappolis and wedding cake and they were phenomenal!!! But on this trip  I was just here for food. I wanted to give this place a better score but I was not happy with the limited selection, prices and the taste.   Maybe just a bakery there would of been great.",

Of course, she thought we should try it and I was glad she forced the issue.   We started with grandmas meatballs, and they were tender and delicious.  Followed this up with the Lasagne and I will say that I am a bit of a Lasagne snob and am very picky.  Up to this visit, I openly stated that my home made lasagne was the best I have ever had, and I now have to admit that Buddy's was a bit better.  A very healthy portion that I could not finish, and the mix of cheeses, meats, pasta, spices and sauce was a True delight.  The waiter we had was great and was extremely helpful with the menu and wine choices.  I would suggest to anyone to go here for a good hearty, filling meal.  Great job Buddy!",

I had seen Eggplant Parm on the lunch menu but noted it was not on the \"Sunset\" menu (3-5pm) and our waiter responded he thought they could manage that but said he couldn't promise...but he delivered. OMG...it was DIVINE!!! It was the perfect balance of crispy eggplant on the outside and not too squishy on the inside. My husband got the Spaghetti Pomodoro - it was delicious. But, honestly, it was the Caesar Salad that was even more memorable. My husband took a bite of the \"crouton\" and told me I had to try it. Well, it was polenta squares that were deep-fried. WOW! It transformed the salad to something we had never experienced. Their Acai Mojito was great, too. Impressive and memorable!",

I would have liked to add a little for dipping.  Chris ordered the pasta of the day, lasagna. SOOOO GOOD! The bechamel was layered thin with a great nutty flavor the sauce was light but flavorful and the cheese was gooie with small charred bubbles that still had their crunch when it got to our table.  I ordered the charred octopus salad OH MY GOODNESS so so so so SO SO SO SO SO GOOD! I was a little iffy about the potato but I should have never doubted whoever made this salad lol.

The salad and bread selection even featured a traditional hot cross buns. Carved meat station had slab bacon along with an incredibly tender leg of lamb. The pastas and meatballs were an excellent nod to the Italian side and made me want to go back for dinner. My kids favorite item was the French toast. The cake boss did not disappoint for the dessert. Individual tiramisu was perhaps the best I ever had and the mini cannoli's had very flavorful filling but we're probably made a bit too early and the shells were already a bit soggy. Unfortunately the only downside to our meal was the grumpy servers and unfriendly host staff. It is a family atmosphere place and they all acted annoyed to be serving children. A pleasant attitude and a smile goes a long way to make you feel welcome. Overall we are glad we picked Buddy V's to celebrate Easter at. As locals we will most likely be back.",

He recommended the veal to each one of us (the most expensive item) and when I ordered chicken picatta he asked if he could bring veal picatta instead.  Same for wines.",

The cannoli for dessert, which my husband loves, tasted good to me too, even though I just had one bite.  I do not like cannoli but I sure liked theirs!  The service was horrible.  Absolutely positively horrible.  Nice people, don't get me wrong, but horrible service.  The \"bread guy\" needed to be told what to do in his job but why couldn't he remember on his own you fill up the water glasses and you keep offering the focaccia?  The waiter was sure to tell me that it was his helper's 19th birthday, but who cares?  Do your job and party later.  The floor manager with the dark black hair and who I believe was dressed too casually for this type of price point restaurant wasn't doing much of anything.  He barely looked up from his texting while showing a waitress what he was texting and laughing about to mumble \"Good night.\".  Help your waiters out man!  Be a team! I believe the waiters have too many tables to be able to give you the service you deserve for paying those \"on the strip\" prices.  My hubby did state his linguini with white clam sauce was not flavorful at all.  He ended up asking for a lot of cheese on top, which you have to wait for also since it is not on the table.  Don't be cheap Buddy, put the cheese on the table!",

    "text": "Buddy V's has absolutely become the Italian restaurant gold standard on the strip. Not only is it an affordable meal but the food is exquisite. It's \"real\" Italian food that tastes homemade but is served in a Strip-type location and atmosphere. I especially love the ravioli. We've tried the Sunday gravy, the lasagna, the spaghetti, the Veal parmesan, the kale (which is amazing) and my favorite the parmesan polenta (delicious). Really I have never had anything that wasn't good at Buddy V's. The tiramisu is excellent (although I admit I was very disappointed when they went away from the traditional large portion down to the small mason jar). They used to have an amazing portion tiramisu  with surprisingly moist chocolate cake at the bottom. I have eaten a LOT of tiramisu all over the country and this is hands down the best. Even better than the great restaurants I enjoyed in NYC. If you'er a local or are in Vegas for a vacation, go to Buddy V's.",

While the food was adequate, the service was non-existent.  To get anything, we had to constantly flag down staff members.  While some may accuse me of being too picky, I think the fact that the restaurant did not have fresh grated parm cheese available (they claim their wheel broke) is a major blunder for an Italian themed restaurant.  I mentioned how poor the service was to one of the floor managers on our way out, and all she could say was \"Please don't let that stop you from coming back.\"  Really?  That's it?  Spend a couple of hundred dollars on dinner only to be told that?  I think it will be long time before I head back that way.  Which is too bad because the bone-in veal parm, with our without parm cheese, is really a wonderful dish. Ironically, shortly after we were seated, a table of 10 or 11 was seated next to us.  The wait staff fawned all over those folks and the chef even came out to meet the leader of their pack.  I guess we weren't high enough rollers to get the attention that we expected.",

I had promised my kids a treat from Carlos' Bakery but the line was huge, so we decided to get a table here instead & have dessert & drinks. It was around 3:30 & as it was between lunch & dinner the restaurant was mostly empty. The hostess informed us that since we weren't actually eating a meal she couldn't seat us at a table reserved for people who were eating a meal.  Hmmm, in a mostly empty restaurant. We would have had a few cocktails each as well as desserts, & we always tip well because regardless of how much or little we eat, the staff still has to do their job. So I guess my one star rating is for the hostess. Maybe we'll be back some day...",

I did not even care for any of the pastries at Carlo's Bakery back in Hoboken, but we wanted to try a little taste of Jersey in Sin City.   The Sunday Gravy (have no fear, you can get this every day) reminded me of those many Sunday dinners back in NY/NJ that started at 2 and ended around midnight. It almost brought a tear to my eye eating that food because it tasted so much like what my grandparents would make for us. Those grand meals are unfortunately a thing of the past, but Buddy V's brought it back to life. The meats in the Sunday Gravy were perfect, the pork was so tender, and you can taste the flavor in every bite of the sausage and meatballs. It was quite a feast and a pretty good value considering that you are right on the Strip. My wife had the lasagne and it was massive. The service was excellent, attentive, but not overly.   Buddy, your pastry shop may not be great, but your Italian restaurant is. Great job! Thank you for bringing a taste of New Jersey to Nevada. The location is tricky, it is on the side of the Venetian between the Palazzo, but once you make it there, you will be back.",

    "text": "Located in the Palazzo Hotel, it's not the best Italian food on the Strip, plus the service was poor. We spotted this restaurant, after seeing the huge line for Carlos' Bakery. That's the bakery from the TV show Cake Boss. Honestly, who would wait 30 minutes for a pastry, when Sprinkles Cupcakes is down the street and pure perfection. Anyway, we saw Buddy V's and read the menu at the front door. The prices seemed reasonable for a Strip restaurant, so we made reservations for 7:00 p.m. We arrived on time, only to wait 30 minutes while they took walk-ins before us. Once seated, the greeting was non-existent. I actually had to stop our waiter, and ask what his name was. It was Chas. After bringing our beverages, he quickly recited the one special, and he asked what we wanted. Totally rushed. I stopped him right there, and began asking questions about the restaurant. \"Chas, who is Carlos?\" \"If Carlos and Buddy V are famous for their cakes, why did they open an Italian restaurant?\" As he became increasingly annoyed with my questions, he explained that the restaurant is based on Buddy V's grandmother's recipes, not Buddy's recipes. Naturally, I commented that Buddy V shouldn't have his name on the restaurant if they're not his recipes. Oh well, just a logically conclusion. The veal Marsala came with a side of pasta. The pasta was good, but the veal Marsala was tough and the sauce was tasteless. Really salty and bland. Our dining experience lasted a quick 35 minutes...even with my insistent questions. Don't waste your money or 35 minutes eating here. There's lots better Italian restaurants on The Strip.",

My husband ordered the (I think it was called the Sunday gravy or something).  It was a pot with red sauce, sausage, veal, and meatballs.  He said it was very good.  I ordered the eggplant parmesan appetizer and the creamy polenta side.  I was too full to finish it, but it was delicious.  The eggplant had a wonderfully crisp coating and was not mushy at all.  The polenta was creamy and wonderful.  I also had a frozen Bellini that was yummy.  We are talking about going back to Vegas just to eat there again!",

My boyfriend suggested we dine there for my birthday the next night. Being raised in an old fashion Italian family that cooked a lot, I usually do not like to eat out at Italian restaurants because the food usually taste too Americanize and falls short of True Italian cuisine.  Well, I must say I give Buddy V's a big 5 stars. Their food, Charred Octopus, Orecchiette & Italian Sausage (pasta), Roasted Branzio (seasonal fish), Italian Greens (Tuscan kale, garlic oil, plum tomatoes) was the best ever!! My whole crazy Italian family would approve! Be warned the tropical drinks are very delicious but very strong. I got cockeyed 1/4 of the way drinking from my glass. I ended the evening with a cannoli which I give a 4 star because I still think my Mom's cannoli were a bit better. I was a little disappointed they did not offer a SMALL comp birthday dessert however they did write happy birthday on my Cannoli plate with chocolate. Coffee was great tasting and the serves rocks! Everyone is friendly and attentive.  I love this place, I may have to come back for brunch!",

WHERE: Located inside of the Grand Canal Shoppes of the Venetian and or Palazzo.  WHEN: Monday through Sunday from 11:30am-10pm; Friday & Saturday from 11:30am-11pm. & most importantly, Happy Hour from 4:30-6:30pm! =D  WHY: BECAUSE EVERYONE'S DOING IT! Lol, just kidding. Wouldn't you like to take part in a sit-down lunch or dinner with your friends and or family in Buddy V's first restaurant in Las Vegas?! & also because Carlo's Bakery is going to open in a few weeks to months just right across the restaurant! SO PERFECT!  WHAT: The first time I came here, my family and I did dinner. As I walked into the restaurant and to the table, I noticed the perfectly dim ambiance that filled the entire room. I love ROMANTICKLE restaurant settings! It makes me HAPPY!   Random Tangent: Sometimes I make words up so don't <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdictionary.com&s=e5ca71fd202348a76a5ddf65093f0d223eef84d0404c547ec933169b573a1d6c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">dictionary.com</a> them because it most likely won't be in there. Haha  So as my family and I were seated, we were handed the menus and ordered. I love dinner with family because we purposely order something different so that we can try each other's food! Too good!  FOOD: Chicken Parm- I personally got the chicken parm, and it was excellent! I wish there could have been a tad bit more spaghetti with it, but overall Yummy! Margherita pizza- My younger cousin chose this pizza, and I'm glad he did because there were slices for every single one of us! SHARING IS CARING! Nonna's Lasagna al Forno- My older cousin ordered the lasagna. From the bite I took, I remember wishing I ordered it! It was definitely a hearty meal because there were leftovers! Thumbs up!  DESSERT: Buddy's XL Lobster Tail- As I was scanning the dessert menu, my eyes suddenly zoomed into this dessert! I absolutely love the flaky pastry shell that enclosed the yummy, creamy, and PERFECT custard cream! (Everytime I go to NY, I search for Lobster Tails!!) Lisa's Warm Nutella Cake- My cousin is addicted to chocolate, as this made his eyes light up! I loved the hazelnut praline crunch, good touch to the chocolatey goodness!  I still want to try the rest of what's on the dessert menu!!! GIMME GIMME GIMME!  HAPPY HOUR: My cousin and I just made it in time for HH the other day, and we went HAM! Grandma's Meatballs- The perfect tasty, softy GOODNESS! I love these meatballs! Macaroni & Cheese Carbonara- I am a mac&cheese fiend! This mac was pretty good. I've never had it with peas, but it actually gave it a sweet taste, GOOD COMBO! Calamari Fritti- Loved the grilled lemon pinwheels, banana peppers, and the tomato aioli! AIOLI!! Meatball sliders- We couldn't get enough of the meatballs, so we had to order it in bread!  Lastly, try the \"CAKE BOSS\" chocolate martini! If you love chocolate & alcohol, it was a really good mix! Tasted exactly like a chocolate cupcake... the only difference is it is in LIQUID FORM, and you may not be able to walk straight after! Lol  Before I continue typing, I am going to STOP and leave you with one thing... ENJOY!! & LET ME KNOW WHEN CARLO'S BAKERY OPENS! HOLLER! =D",

It had to be asked for after trying to hunt down the server..   Although this may seem like a small thing the attitude of the server goes a far way to contribute to the star rating given.   The whole experience was marred with slow service,  inefficiency and smacked of a back street joint rather than the upmarket restaurant it is supposed to be.   Guys it is the small things that that matter,  big name but small on performance....  Won't be back!",

Food was outstanding, we had chicken parm, spaghetti and the lasagna at our table and we all tried bite of each meal and all were very delicious and tasteful. Service was a little slow to getting our order and then getting the check but he was a great server none the less, very entertaining. I love the family atmosphere they had as well as the touches of family in the menus. We also had a bottle of the moscato which was amazing with our meals. Highly recommend this place for some good cabs before a night out on the strip!",

I had the meatballs for an app. You get 3 in a small boat of gravy (pasta sauce ) And they were spot on east coast Italian meatballs. They use the holy trinity of meat which is hard to find on the west coast and the sauce can't be beat . This is the kind of sauce that makes me want to step up my game because it Puts my gravy to shame !! For the meal I ordered the bucatini carbonara - again it knocks your socks off. The pasta is cooked perfectly , pancetta is crispy and the sauce light and creamy.. Simple and elegant . For dessert I ordered the tiramisu which came in a 2 oz canning jar and 3 lady fingers .. What a divine way to end a perfect meal. As a side note my husband ordered the 3 course meal as well. He ate it before I could get a pic , and I didn't get to try anything he ordered except his dessert . So we will have to take his word for it when he says the tomato basil soup was fantastic , and his chicken Parmesan  was the best he's ever had . He stated that the chicken had a light breadcrumb coating (he hates when it's thick like some sort of chicken bird sweater )  and his side of spaghetti was cooked perfect and served with the same type of sauce as my meatballs . For his dessert he ordered the cannoli.. Oh holy cannoli was that amazing!! I ended up eating it for him as he is lactose intolerant .. A good wife would have explained that cannoli are stuffed with marscapone cheese ! But.... Here we are ..",

Buddy V had a happy hour, so we decided to take a seat in the bar area where the live band was setting up. I tried a red sangria. It was so bad, I could only take one sip. I also ordered Lisa's warm nutella cake. The nutella was missing and the cake was dry until you reach the middle where the chocolate sauce oozed out. The combination of the cake, ice cream, and the praline crunch paired well together, but the ice cream was the best out of the three, although not amazing. The dessert wasn't as bad as his cupcakes. I just expected more from the Buddy brand. Our waitress and the ambiance were great, however.",

The Sunday Eggs were our favorite, and my wife isn't much of a fan of scrambled eggs.  The frittata had a lot of huge chunks of vegetables, especially asparagus.  The meatballs, chicken apple sausage, freshly smoked bacon, chicken parmesan, and mac-n-cheese were all excellent.  Of course, there were croissants, fresh breads, pastries, cannolis, tiramisu, zonuts, and other desserts.  The food was all delicious and far exceeded our expectations.  We also had all you can drink alcohol.  My wife had bellinis, sangrias, and mimosas.  I had a few beers which, unfortunately, was cheap domestics, but whatever.  I definitely recommend Buddy V's, which is right across the hall from Carlo's Bakery, and the next time we're in Vegas, we'll definitely be back.",

It's kid friendly too with a kids station even an adult would enjoy. The staff is on top of things and Asst. GM Adam Margolies is visible and easy to talk to.

You can get a Lobster Tail (for $15) and a few other things that you can only get at the restaurant. Prices are decent for a strip meal. The place was pretty empty so we were seated quick. They had a lunch deal which included a salad, entree and dessert for $22. They had enough options to choose from and everything was pretty tasty. I got the salad panzanella, margherita pizza and cannoli. Everything was great. I would have liked more fresh mozzarella on the salad because it was so good. The pizza could have used more sauce but those are my likes when I make that salad and pizza. I would go again for sure and maybe next time get the $15 Lobster Tail.",

So we wondered around and found Buddy V's so we gave it a try my husband loves Italian food. We got a table on the indoor patio, interesting as it faces the bathrooms and lots of people going by. First we were never given focaccia bread and oil. We ordered large ceaser salad and chicken parm to split. We also ordered garlic bread as we know nothing about the focaccia. The chicken parm was good but I took one bite of the pasta and had to ask if it was fresh made the waitress assured us that it was, it did not taste like fresh pasta and on top of that it was gummy. The waitress was very nice about it and offered a dessert we declined. Ceaser salad nothing great very dry no oil cheese anchovie flavor to it, like you would expect at a Italian restaurant more food court except for the croutons they are very different my husband did not like them and I thought they were ok because they were unusual.",

We were running a bit late so we called the restaurant and they were so nice and had no issues pushing our reservation back by about 15 minutes.  Once seated we ordered some wine and sparkling water. I know this is something very minor but I loved that the sparkling water was nice and cold -- you'd be surprised how many restaurants give it at room temperature. We immediately ordered entrees and I ordered the Chicken Rigatoni Alla Vodka and my friend ordered the Bucatini Carbonara. Both of them were so so good. My Rigatoni had just the right amount of sauce and it was incredibly flavorful and they gave Parmesan cheese and red chili flakes on top and that just added the perfect touch. I had a few bites of my friends Bucatini and it was so delicious -- usually restaurants use spaghetti to make Carbonara but using Bucatini was such a great touch. I love that the egg was mixed perfectly in without scrambling it. My only regret is that I wish we had been more hungry to eat more!  I've tried A LOT of restaurants in Vegas but this is one where I will definitely return!!",

This was the perfect place to celebrate and was not terribly overpriced like some of the other Vegas restaurants.   Everybody seemed to enjoy their entrees. I started with a caesar salad, which was a bit on the salty side. The carbonara with shrimp was super yummy and was realistically large enough to share. Others had ordered the shrimp scampi, lasagna, Sunday gravy and sea scallops...all of which looked great!   This is a great place for a special occasion meal!",

They had a buffet set up and for $34.95 we got to choose from an array of antipasto, pasta, meats, soups and desserts. We also took the option for all you can drink for only $16.95 additional which included peach Bellini, mimosas, sangria, domestic beer and wine.   I took full advantage of the cheese board/antipasto area and filled my plate with prosciutto, salami, Gorgonzola, pecorino and focaccia bread. The marinated olive mix with peppers was delicious! Must try this. Also grabbed some iced peel and eat shrimp that had a nice spice to them that I wasn't expecting, but enjoyed.   Chicken parm was a bit soggy from sitting in the hot tray unfortunately. Orecchiette and sausage pasta was simple, but great and probably my favorite thing.   Loved the Italian sausage, did not really like the chicken apple sausage.   Tiramisu was awesome. Cannolis were just ok in my book.   Great place for families to dine and well worth the price tag for the brunch buffet.",

On the way out, make sure to stop off at the Cake Boss' Bakery and grab some wedding cake and other sweets. Just a heads up though, it's amazing, sweet and expensive! We spent 60 bucks on sweets that were \"snacks\".   Worth the stop and a great special meal place if you're a visiting tourist.",

    "text": "Holy cow. If you're not down to read this long review, the gist of it is: best buffet in Vegas hands down.  I came here for a comp'd Sunday Brunch buffet, which is normally priced at about $35 per person-- already pretty reasonable for the strip. But you're getting SUCH BETTER FOOD than you're finding at the standard all you can eat buffets in hotels. Everything was fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. The food is constantly being swapped out for fresh batches, and everything just TASTES homemade. The meats were the biggest surprise-- I don't think I've had meat that tasted that good and UNprocessed since visiting Europe... I'm not joking. The pastries were also fluffy and clearly created by an expert.   There was a lot of variety though I did feel that the brunch leaned more lunch than breakfast... so know that coming in. The breakfast food was limited to regular scrambled eggs, \"Sunday Style\" eggs (with cheese and veggies mixed in), bacon and sausage options. Other food available was cheeses, meats, shrimp, pastas and a SLEW of desserts.  I tried getting a small taste of everything and there wasn't one thing I didn't like. I often have trouble with buffets where I grab a bunch of stuff on my plate but it doesn't necessarily taste great TOGETHER-- but that didn't happen here. Everything was very cohesive and worked well together no matter what you piled on your plate.  I highly recommend the Orichette pasta, the Carbonara Mac & Cheese, the sausages, and the croissants. You won't go wrong with any of the desserts-- but be sure you grab one of their famous cannolis!!",

Prior to our dine in, the manager provided us with different menu options that would best fit our party. We eventually went with a pre-fixed course that included these options for about $64pp (including 8.25% tax and 21% service fees):  Under Starters- select 1 Appetizers-select 1 Mains-select 2 Desserts-select 2.  We selected the items below: Starter: Margherita -  Appetizers: Grandma's Meatballs Mains: Chicken Rigatoni and Spaghetti Bolognese Desserts: Lisa's Warm Nutella Cake and Cannoli   Overall, all the dishes were delicious, a bit on the saltier side FYI. And of course we left with shameful amounts of leftovers (because that's what happens with girls in Vegas, we tryna look good in our night swim bikins, don't hate). The winner goes to Lisa's Warn Nutella Cake... this is a MUST order. As soon as the soft chocolate molten cake with warm gooey nutella inside hits your tongue, it will make you......mmhmm. Yes.

We ordered the garlic bread, grandma's meatballs, and split the chicken parm. It was so much food so we were glad that we decided to split the entree. They bring warm bread to the table with olive oil and balsamic for dipping. I'm not normally a big bread person but it was really good. The meatballs were so tender and delicious, I highly recommend. The garlic bread was cheesy and had just the right amount of garlic. I was honestly a little disappointed with the chicken parm. It needed some more sauce and was a thicker cut than normal. I don't regret ordering it, just wasn't impressed. Maybe it's because we're from NJ and are used to getting really good parm. The spaghetti was perfect al dente and the sauce was great. If you want an inexpensive meal with a good environment, I'd recommend you check Buddy V's out.",

After standing in line at the bakery we found ourselves starving and impatient so we decided to just go into this sister restaurant right across the hall. Went in with no expectations and having read nothing about the place and was totally blown away!   I had the chicken ceasar salad cause after spending 3 days in vegas all I wanted were vegetables and water. The romaine was crisp, the dressing was yummy, and the crutons were the star of the dish... parmesan polenta crutons!? That's a thing? You're damn right that's a thing and it's amazing! Would give it a full 5 but they were a bit skimpy on the chicken. 4.5/5  The man ordered the Philly Cheese Sandwich which was also delicious. Crisp and soft bread, ooy-gooy cheese, juicey thin slices of perfectly seasoned meat. It's not a traditional Philly in any sense but it's Truely one of the best I've ever had. 5/5  Might I add they offer the dessert we were standing in line for at the bakery. Kind of wish we had just dined here and ordered a pastry for dessert!  Would definitely dine here again give it a shot for sure!",

    "text": "I loved this place. It reminded me of the old Villa Penza and other old school joints where the cook or the owner mingles and sits with you for a while and makes you feel at home even though they know you are leaving.  These are the special touches that made the old school joints what they were with tile floors and checkered tablecloths and the food was nectar of the gods and 'ambience' was for people who didnt know anything about food.  These elements gave us the confidence to break some rules like 'never order spaghetti and clam sauce outside of the metropolitan area'.  The simplicity of this dish was a revelation.  The DeCecco macaroni was cooked to perfection, It was the perfect platform for the teeny tiny baby clams that are mandatory for this dish and no substitutions.  The fragrance of the baby clams, the garlic, the textures, it was just magnificent and like no other commercially prepared dish we have had in years.  Kudos!  I dont like sitting on top of the kitchen.  Its too loud and too hot.  This was neither.  It was very entertaining.  They were loving the food they were preparing and it made you that much more excited about how good it was going to be to see this.  The veal marsala was fantastic.  It was good quality veal and the marsala was not cloying and sickeningly sweet as the cheap marsalas are.  This was proper marsala.  The osso buco was great, cooked to perfection, falling off the bone resting on a pool of creamy polenta.  I highly recommend the 'birthday cake' for dessert.  Its an experience.  While many of these authentic homestyle dishes are stylized for presentation, this is the way we really eat in  NJ.  Great meatballs.    This visit was AFTER Gordon Ramsay Steak and in no way was it a letdown, it was right up there with GR.    Kudos to Adam Margolies and his exceptional staff.",

    "text": "We had reservations for dinner at Buddy V's on our second evening in Vegas. However, after indulging in a tall, alcoholic slushy sold on the Strip, we were not up for dinner and canceled our reservation. Throughout our stay, we dined at several high end establishments, but none were as good as we found Buddy V's to be when we popped in for lunch on our last day!  The staff greeted us warmly, suggested we take a window seat with a great view of the strip and were responsive and attentive during our meal.  My husband and I ordered the three course express lunch, which was an incredible value at $22 by Vegas standards. I had the panzanella salad and found it to be superb. My husband had the Caesar salad served with polenta croutons, which was pure deliciousness. For our entrees, we both had the chicken Parmesan, again delicious . The lunch portion was so generous, that we could have easy shared one order. We looked forward to the dessert, as that is what Buddy V is known for. We were not disappointed: the cannoli was heavenly on its own, but the dark chocolate sauce put it over the top. Hubby had the salted caramel gelato served with biscotti. Good, but no competition with the cannoli. We were so glad we were able to finally dine at Buddy V's! It was the best meal, value and service of our vacation.",

We had the caprese and the panzanela salad, both were ok, nothing out of the ordinary.  For an entree I had the veal Marsala, comes with a side of linguine which was flavorless. Veal itself was decent but nothing that would impress.  Desserts was the only salvageable items that we had, cannoli and lobster tail made me give them 2 stars.  Would not return to this place, there's other Italian places that are much better.",

One of us had a steak, which was cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious. The other, got a Margherita pizza which honestly kind of spoiled the whole meal. The dough was meh, and the toppings were almost non existent. Only about 20% of the pizza had cheese on it, there were 3-4 tomato slices and basil leaves spread across the 8 slices. The worst thing however was the sauce, my first impression when I tasted it was that they had used sewer water and canned tomatoes to make. The whole thing was soggy with this sauce, which was simply gross. It's a shame, because the rest of the meal was great :/",

Service was fabulous! All of the wait staff were very attentive. We ordered grandma's meatballs, lasagna and the chicken parm. The meatballs were absolutely delicious! Best restaurant meatballs I've ever had. My husband raved about the lasagna and talked about it the rest of the night. We would definitely go back just to have that. Chicken parm was good, but not the best in LV. The sauce on all the food had great flavor and consistency. Being Italian and growing up in NY, this restaurant exceeded my expectations. We will definitely be back!",

I've been coming here for 3 years in a row for my birthday and once for our anniversary and the food has not disappointed once.  This is about their service. Like I stated I, with my family, having been here 3 years in a row and have received excellent service and food, until this last time in August. I originally called to reserve a table for 8 guests and a baby. I was later informed that one more person was to be added, so I called to see if I can get a bigger table. I was told I couldn't because it was a busy night for them, that maybe we could squeeze another chair, that was fine since it was for a kid. When we sat down there was so space for a car seat sling, my cousin's baby was on the floor behind her chair. The manager did not want to move us to a bigger table, which there were plenty of! The whole time we sat and ate and left there were bigger tables all around us! How is having a baby sitting in a car seat on the floor behind the chairs next to another table safe? We asked if this was a hazard or safe or a fire hazard and she kept saying no. We felt uncomfortable leaving him there (he was 2 months at the time) so my cousin had to hold him the whole time we dined. Then came time to pay. We could not do split. He la according to the waiter, the \"computer\" wouldn't let him. So we all wrote down our amounts and the card number on the back of the receipt. He then came back to say we were short. He was talking about the SUGGESTED gratuity. When then explained we would add gratuity when we signed the receipt. He said again that the \"computer\" would not let him because the total of the bill was the amount with the SUGGESTED gratuity includes. How is this even possible? My cousin tried arguing with him other wise but the waiter would not budge! He was determined to get his suggested gratuity. My cousin was getting rather upset so we budged and paid the total and walked away. Happy 30th to me! Sad to say that even though I LOVE the food here, this will no longer be my annual birthday dinner spot.",

While the portions are appropriate, the food itself was not. My meatballs (\"grandma's meatballs\" appetizer) were great, they tasted homemade! The \"Spaghetti Bolognese\" was incredibly basic, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the spaghetti noodles were simply basic. The biggest disappointment was the cannoli. Obviously I had high expectations not only because of the price, but because of the insane hype that surrounds this restaurant, because of the fact that it is owned by Buddy Valastro and family, from the show Cake Boss, which regularly features and highlights their cannolis as a staple item. It was so incredibly stale on the outside, I had to literally smack it with my knife to knock a chunk off of it to eat, which would have been okay if it wasn't just a greasy, dried up piece of crust. The filling was sub-par as well, I'd have rather had some cool whip inside there, at least it would be somewhat pleasant. Overall, the food was poor.  Our service was phenomenal, both of our waiters/ servers were very kind, fun, and knowledgeable.   If you're looking for good food, go somewhere else.",

Not sure what happened from 2 years ago to now. The prices were raised for the Sunday brunch which makes it not so worth it considering the Buccanel Buffett is 20 more with way more variety and fresh everything.  We called ahead to make sure of the hours it ends and was told 230pm.. We arrived at 1130 and they tried to turn us down. I got a little direct and let her know we called and she said fine and sat us.  Our waiter was ok.. Brought our drinks and was pretty friendly.  Crepes - had a hair.. I was discreet and told a staff member as I seen another in the pan.  The Mac n Cheese Carbonara... used to be the best Italian dish there.. not so much.. the sauce was drowning the noodles and it just seemed to have a not so fresh taste..  they took a long time to refill it when it was empty As well as if they were trying not to serve much of it.  The French toast triangles were hard and dry. The cheese counter is always a great spot.  The kids section is crap. The bread pudding was great especially topped with a couple apples From the apple crumb desert. The variety of food VS. the now $39.99 cost is not Worth it at all.. I was super bummed and won't be returning next month on my planned trip.",

They offered a $40 3-course meal special, and an extra $10 if you get the NY Strip Steak as an entree. I decided to splurge and I ordered the steak as my entree, the tomato soup as my app and the cannoli as my dessert. I would definitely recommend the soup, but I was not much of a fan of the steak nor the cannoli. I tried my friend's chicken parmesan and while it was good, I feel like it is not that hard to make a good chicken parmesan.   In summation, while it is not one of the best restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip it definitely is a good choice if you are visiting The Venetian.",

Try: Spaghetti Pomodoro Chicken Rigatoni Alla Vodka  Pro: While the restaurant is usually quite lively, they separate the tables out in a way that makes conversation possible, which is usually an afterthought nowadays. The service was quick and practically invisible, which can be good or bad, depending on your preference.  The food itself was simple, solid Italian. You won't be disappointed, nor will you be blown away. It's a safe choice for a good evening out.  Con: If you have a large party, you'll have to be split up amongst several tables.",

Our server (wish I could remember his name) was amazing and attentive. Our glasses were never empty.  The food tasted amazing. However, it felt a little pricey for what it was. I wish there was a few additional options. But what can I expect, it's on the Strip ",

    "text": "Some great, some average, overall would definitely recommend Buddy V if you're craving Italian.  The good: Our server was very sweet and funny and speaks five languages fluently, he definitely made our experience more memorable. the Lasagna and Sunday Gravy are freakin delicious. Lasagna has just the right meat/cheese/carb ratio (Read: a lot of cheese. Can you blame me though?), served hot, and melt in your mouth. Sunday Gravy is a luscious, generously-portioned plate of stewed meat and meat balls soaked in marinara sauce that will blow any carnivore's mind away. Buddy's favorite pizza is also tasty with well-seasoned sausage. For dessert, don't miss the warm Nutella cake. Just, don't, miss, it. For drinks, old fashioned was worth a try.   The meh: chicken parm was dry, chicken rigatoni was unmemorable. Tiramisu was good but was paled in the presence of the Nutella cake. Cheesecake was pretty average (Read: not sweet, worth ordering if you're going for cheesecake). My drink (sugar and spice) was too sweet for my liking.  Recommend going family style and get multiple things to try. Portions are big so don't go crazy.",

Large portions for a reasonable price. I got the veal marsala which was recommended by our waitress and it did not disappoint. Two large tender pieces of meat with plenty of mushrooms in their thin marsala sauce. Only critique I had was that I thought the sauce was over salted. The linguine in garlic sauce was perfect. My fiance enjoyed the shrimp scampi linguine in a white sauce. Had a hint of lemon and was fresh. Five jumbo shrimp cooked perfectly. We each had a side salad and shared grandmas meatballs (lamb, pork, and beef) with their complementary garlic bread. Meatballs tasted like home cooking. Skipped dessert and went to his bakery across the way, but could easily get one of his infamous desserts with dinner. I'd return to try other menu items!",

The calamari was great, neither greasy nor over battered, and came with a delicious dipping sauce.  The sliced grilled lemon was delicious too.   The meatballs were firm, not crumbly and came with a great tasting marinara sauce.   The meatball sliders,came on a fluffy tasty bun.   Both the bloody Mary's and the bloody Caesar's were as good as any that are made in the area. The sangria was good and came plenty of fresh fruit (in the glass).  The happy hour Chardonnay is nothing to brag about though.",

My husband loves lasagna and he gets mine (though not as often as he would like), so he is pretty spoiled and was unfortunately not at all impressed with his dish. The whole thing lacked seasoning and was pretty bland. I had the pasta scampi and liked mine, the shrimp were nice and big, pasta was al-dente and it was nicely seasoned. We were sooo looking forward to Buddy's famous lobster tails, but they were sold out at 5:30pm already. We did get the canolli and they were amazing as well... so back to 4*. Service was also friendly and attentive, but prices are pretty high for simple pasta dishes?",

We made a reservation in advance because we knew that it was a popular high demand place to eat. When we came to to the resturant we waited about 5 minutes so that while they got our table ready.  Once we were seated, we were instanlty greeted and served with drinks. Our Waiter was extremley nice! We informed them that we have people with food allergys and they took note to them.  Our waiter asked us what they were and took note (peaches, peanuts, onion, shell fish, and nuts where the allergains.) When it came time to order our food, he helped those with food allergeys first. Insuring that they order somthing that they can eat. He even made sure to check with the chef if it can make something without it in the dish.   Everytime someone came out with food they asked who the people were with the allergey and told them wheather or not it is safe for them to eat it. One of the managers informed us that it would take a while for the food to come out since there are so many allergeys. All in all it took 50 minutes for our main entrees to come out and 30 minutes for the appitizers. The food not only looked amazing, but it tastes delicious.  We also had some cocktails, which were not only very strong (for those who like to drink with their meals :)) but they were very refreshing.   Towards the end, we had informed our waiter that we have two people celebrating their birthday and he went to the back and brought them both out a canoli with a candle.   This was by far the best experience that any of us could have asked for. I highly reccomend if you are looking for great italian food.",

We ordered our food by 4:10pm and no one came to check on us until I had a chance to wave down the server. This was at 4:37pm. He said he will go check on the food. The female manager came by within a few minutes of our complaint and only apologized and offered us free bread. Which we did not accept bc we were saving our stomached for the food we ordered. The food came out at 4:48.   Overall we felt like we were not taken care of and the food was subpar. The chicken parm was good but the other pasta dishes had no flavor. If you are craving pasta especially seafood pasta make sure you bypass this place and head into the square and dine at Mercato del Pescheria which blows this place out of the water! Would definitely not recommend this place!",

I had the free range chicken breast with fingerling potatoes and spinach.  Juicy chicken with outstanding flavour and an amazing presentation.  This restaurant hits it out of the park every time we eat here.  We hope to be back in Vegas in 2018 and will definitely be back.  Thanks for making our Vegas experience that much better.",

We weren't looking for anything too heavy because this was a late lunch and dinner was scheduled for 8pm.  There wasn't a wait and we arrived during happy hour (4:30pm-6:30pm seven days a week). My wife had the Sangria and I had the Bloody Mary & Caesar. Tasty!  We ordered the calamari, mac &a cheese carbonara, smashed meatball sliders, & sausage & peppers sliders. All of it was perfect.  Service was attentive and prompt. Definitely on the list to come back!",

The meatballs tasted homemade along with the bolognese sauce. Calamari batter was crispy and light, not to mention the delicious pizza (I recommend Buddy's Favorite). Don't forget the famous Carlo's Bakery cannolis. Everything was so amazing including the service. I highly recommend!",

We had eggplant parm..another OMG moment. Daughter had chicken rigatoni with tomato based cream  sauce that was heavenly! A small side ofside of Cesar salad which was also very fresh and flavorful.

The bread they bring your table is addictive it's so good! Service was great.   Deserts were kind of a let down. I tried the Nutella cake and was kind of let down for the $10 you pay for it. Seemed kind of small and didnt really taste much like Nutella. I was disappointed as buddy is known for his amazing over the top deserts.",

The gentleman  that served us water and some bread, I believe his name is Carlos was amazing, very attentive and awesome guy..the two stars are because of him. Now let's talk about the elephant in the room, her name is valerie, I wish you dont get her as your server because she does not have the patience to listen to the full order nor to give any suggestion. . My order finally arrives and my pasta was undercooked. Asked her if the kitchen could just cook the pasta a little bit longer. She says sure, doesn't bother apologizing, whatever. This other lady comes out and says, did you not want the pasta anymore? I dont know how much clearer I should have been. All is all. Decent food. Amazing service from Carlos but Valerie really needs to work on that rather then delivering the food to our table and chit chatting with people all the way on the other side of the room or may be they need to get more servers because she cnt handle it!!!",

The majority of the courses were excellent. I didn't like how the waiter pushed more food than was necessary. I also had the veal piccata and it wasn't that good. Eating starved baby cows only happens once a year for me and it wasn't worth it on that meal. The cheesy garlic bread was very delicious.

    "text": "Not as pleased as I thought I would be!  Came here for a birthday celebration while in Vegas and was let down.  Got here on a Saturday evening ready to feast and was seated promptly after waiting for the rest of my party to arrive. The hostess lead my group to a table by the window and we were seated and given menus.  The items on the menu seemed really good. I knew I wanted something with sausage while the rest of group went with the steaks and spaghetti. The first issue came when everyone had decided on what they wanted and they server took 20 minutes to come back to the table to take our order. That was somewhat odd especially since when the drink was taken he overlooked my order, seriously!!!! I had to ask another waiter who was helping another table to grab my drink, that's not good.  Next, when the waiter did eventually come over to take our orders he insisted on orders rather than giving recommendations, hmmmm, not smooth! The issue with the orders was that everyone's order was taken except for one but that member of my party could not order because the waiter has walked away after getting the 5th order. Why would you do that when there is another person at the table!!! Once again, we had to get another waiter to add another steak to our order because our waiter was unable to do that the first time!!  As for the food, my meal was great. Everyone that ordered a steak loved their food. However, the spaghetti, I was informed, was a bit sour! I did not try it but I told by another member of my dinner party.   Once finished with our food. We had to wait another 20 minutes before we could get the check. Getting the check went like this. In finally getting the attention of the waiter I got two words out asking for the check and then he interrupted and didn't let me finish to offer dessert. Seriously, usually there is a back and forth in communication but this guy had to speak over me, confusing to me! Again, he was insistent about getting a dessert rather than suggesting or recommending.   Once I finally got the check everyone was ready to go because this waiter was just no helpful in explaining anything or being attentive to our party. Not a memorable birthday dinner for the birthday girl after talking with her about her dinner. She liked the food but the service a bit aggressive. I guess working here causes the workers to be impatient and overbearing. I don't think so because the other waiters that I talked to were very gracious about assisting my table. I think the gentleman that helped us that evening was just trying way to hard and no making a good impression.   The food was fine but the service was below what I expected based the reviewed I have heard about Buddy V's. I wanted to 5 star this place but the service killed that potential rating. I hope this situation does not happen to anyone else. But, kudos to the chefs in the kitchen who worked hard to prepare the food.  #buddyvhelpmeout",

The one thing that dampened everyone's meal was the server. She was haste and not very amicable. I feel like I saw her at most 3 times during our entire meal.   Nonetheless, the meal itself was pretty delicious. We order a variety of the happy hour bites such as the meatballs, sliders and Mac and cheese to share. I ordered the chicken and pasta which I actually felt like it was large enough to share. I would also recommend taking advantage of the happy hour drinks to go along with your meal. Overall experience was a little more than average but definitely could have been better. Hoping to make another visit to give this place another try.",

    "text": "Classic Italian food with a cozy, yet contemporary atmosphere ~  I have to admit that I wasn't a fan of TLC's \"Cake Boss\" and didn't follow it but I knew of the show and appreciated that it was a family affair. When the restaurant opened in Vegas I didn't really have any desire to try it out until my man had a business lunch there and told me I had to try it.   We've been here twice now and I'm happy to say that the food is just delicious! My favorite dish is Buddy's mother in law's capellini shrimp scampi. Packed with flavor I can't stop eating it and it never comes home with me for a late night snack. There's tons of garlic, roasted tomatoes, spinach and white wine! My man has enjoyed everything he's tried from the meatball sandwich, chicken parmigiana  and his favorite dish which happens to be the super cheesy lasagna.   The warm, complimentary focaccia bread is always a hit and we've had the calamari and caesar salad which were great.  Don't forget to tell them if you're celebrating anything special as they'll bring out a mini cannoli on the house.   Located across from the restaurant is Buddy's bakery which serves the best chocolate dipped strawberries in case you want something for later!",

After our orders were taken they brought out oil and balsamic for dipping but never brought out the bread.  We asked and were told 5 minutes but it never came.  They threw some sliced bread on the grill with butter, but I've had better toast at Perkins.  Eventually entries came but imagine my surprise to see the kids chicken parm had more chicken than the the adult size chicken vodka.  Manager was responsive and brought out additional chicken to add to my entree when I pointed it out.  I did not ask to be comped for the chicken vodka but it was taken off the bill.  Waitress was excellent and atmosphere inviting... but the bread never came",

We had lasagna, salmon, chicken parmigiana, and vodka pasta. The salmon was very good along with the lasagna. The chicken parmigiana was also very good. Chicken was fried smothered in cheese. Even though everyone was satisfied with the meal our waiter talked us into dessert. We had a tray of canolli's, molten chocolate cake, gelato, and other desserts. Great lunch experience.",

    "text": "In Las Vegas for several days and headed to the strip looking for a dining establishment...just because we were in Las Vegas.  Now here is the problem for one that does not know Las Vegas...it can be very overwhelming by the selection of dining establishments and trying to walk to / find another option than those in the casio/hotel complex you are in, can be challenging given the distances involved.  We were in the Venetian and enjoyed walking along the Grand Canal.  And we ended up at Buddy V's and very glad we did.  Unfortunately it was a Friday night and there was a 90 minute wait for a table.  There was seating in the bar / lounge area and it shares the same dinner menu, so off we went.    Ordered the $40 price fix menu which included an appy, entree, and dessert.  I selected the caesar salad, chicken parmesan and for dessert, the cannoli.  I will start with the good.  The chicken parmesan is good, really good...nicely breaded and covered with a nice tangy tomato sauce then melted cheese.  The cannoli was okay...very rich and a nice end to a dinner.  The portion size of both were quite large and one will not leave hungry.  Unfortunately there was no taste to the caesar salad dressing and the polenta croutons were simply awful...really terrible.  I had higher expectations for their caesar salad.  Our server was pleasant and attentive and the food was brought out fairly promptly after each course.  All in all, it was a positive food experience and happy to recommend Buddy V's...just not their caesar salad.",

The waiter, Giorgio, was incredible.  Recommended the couples special that consisted of two appetizers, two/ three main courses and a dessert tray.   Apps- meatballs and a meat and cheese sampling was a meal onto itself.   Main Courses- Beef tenderloin in a red wine reduction, over mashed potatoes. Wow! Grilled Sea Bass and Rigatoni. Unbelievable!!! Finally, a tray of pure delight!! Cookie Dough Gelato, Molten Chocolate Cake, Canoli and Tiramisu!!  This place is so good!!

I ordered the chicken rigatoni with a tomato based cream sauce. Omg it was delicious. I tried not to eat it all and failed miserably. The sauce really makes the dish. You probably won't have room for dessert but try to chicken rigatoni and you will leave happy!",

So my husband and I walked from our hotel over to Buddy Vs without having a reservation. When I first saw the place, and how large it was, I kind of thought this might be just a so-so place, maybe closer to fast food than I had hoped. But it absolutely was not fast food. It was lovely.  Upon being seated, our waiter (Peter) immediately came over to inquire about drinks. When I went to order, my picky self literally needed to modify everything (sorry, chef). Instead of a salad, I asked if I could have just tomatoes and cucumbers with a little lemon. For the chicken piccata, I asked for it without the capers and without any garnish. Sweet Peter says, \"oh, so you basically want lemon chicken?\"  Be still my beating heart. Yes. My cucumbers and tomatoes (at least 3 different varieties) came out quickly and were fresh and delicious. My lemon chicken came out exactly as I wanted it.  From the person filling the water, to the person bringing bread to the table, to the person delivering the food, and - of course - Peter, the service was way beyond our expectations. Not once was I made to feel that my modifying the food was a problem, which is huge to a picky eater like myself. Everyone was genuinely nice, enough so that we went out of our way to find the manager before we left to let them know how happy we were.  If I am in Las Vegas again, I will definitely visit this restaurant and will specifically ask to sit in Peter's section. I hope he knows he can never, ever quit.  :)",

During our meal the manager came by and chatted with us for quite a while about restaurants in Chicago he and my husband has both visited.

Meatball subs are, in my opinion, generally too dry, but the two I've had at Buddy's have been pretty moist. The parmesan fries are hot and crispy, they were very good. Sevice has been good, no problems in that area. My one complaint was the first time I went I got breadsticks, second time none. I am not a fan of Cake Boss so I was really just there for the food, next time I might try something different like chicken parm. Both times I was there it was a weekday afternoon right when they opened so it was not crowded. There was a lot of people at Buddy's bakery across the hall though.",

    "text": "I came to visit for the first time for Restaurant Week for my sister's birthday. I'm pretty impressed Buddy. I have to admit that so far, your dishes taste just as good as your cakes (well...the cakes look good so maybe as good as your cakes look?)   I booked reservations for seating on Open Table for my sister's birthday. Told them the occasion and requested a nice little \"surprise\". They did more than that. They gave us the best seat (take note here because this seat is the seat you want) in the house. You walk past kitchen, past the bar, and the main floor. You'll see these big windows that help open up the room with natural sunlight. In front of that window lies a simple yet perfect table for four. You can look right out and see the strip from above, and if I'm correct the pirate show at TI also!  My sister and I ordered the garlic bread, caprese salad, meatballs, and Chicken Parmesan.   The MEATBALLS are definitely one I recommend, but beware! These come as appetizer and can be very filling! So if you intend to make it to dessert, I'd be careful with this one. One order would be good to share with your party. It's so full of flavor, juicy, and tender. Major noms. I think it's because of the veal.   The GARLIC BREAD. Oh the garlic bread is also a major 5! Extra cheesy, extra buttery, and extra extra garlicy. An extra 5 points if I could because it tastes just as good as a leftover. It came with 4 HUGE pieces and one is a good size to split in half with another (that is if you're a light to medium eater).   CAPRESE SALAD is also a great recommendation if you're looking for a nice salad to eat. Full of color and flavor. They have like 3-4 different types of tomatoes in it. There was cherry tomatoes and some tomato that is red, purple, and green (it's good I swear!). It was topped with a perfect ration to cheese and drizzled around with a light olive oil and balsamic vinegar.   **CHICKEN PARMESAN two extra stars because Buddy V's chicken parmy will probably become that GO-TO-MUST-HAVE dish. I mean it's just chicken parmy right? I know...but it was perfect. The sauce wasn't too much nor thick or overpowering. The breading on the chicken had that perfect crunch to their tender chicken. It had that nice bed of creamy melted cheese topped with a wonderful POW of garlic flavor and herbs and spices. I'm a variety seeker so I always go to different place and try different things, but once I find THAT DISH it's hard to steer me away from it. That dish is THIS PARMY.  **DRAGO ROSSO-It hasabsolut ruby red, pomegranate, jalapeno & mango. It's divine! I love spice. This has a whole lot of spice. If you're into bloody mary's or the mexican drinks with the clamato juice. You have to try it. WARNING though. It is really spicy so if you only like a lighter taste of spice for your palette I recommend you pass.  BUT! Service was great, the ambiance was amazing. Casual, but upscale? More for business meetings, lunch, and special occasions. Lastly, it was cute after my request they surprised my sister with bakery made cookies with a light up sparkler.

    "text": "One of the newer restaurant that opened here at The Palazzo, it is located on the second level of The Grand Canal Shoppes, next to Barney's New York.  Came here on a date and yes, I do agree with a fellow Yelper that it IS a big spacious restaurant so it doe not give you the intimate, romantic/family style a Italian restaurant should be. But hey...it's located in a 5 diamond hotel right ON THE STRIP...what else can you expect?  To sum it up, everything we ordered was delicious. The service was great, our waiter was attentive the entire time keeping our drinks filled, napkins/utensils were delivered quick.  We got an order of their famous meatballs as an appetizer. I believe it came with six. Perfect to start off with. The meatballs were very flavorful and they weren't puny little meatballs either. For our entrees, I ordered chicken Parmesan and my date ordered a pasta dish. Let me tell you, like most restaurants here on the strip, portions were pretty big. I definitely had leftovers for the next day. My chicken Parmesan wasn't dried and they put the perfect amount of melted cheese on top.  We also ordered dessert. Not a big fan of sweets to begin with and I was already full from dinner. But my date suggested we share something soooo....sure, why not? We ordered the canoli and it was wayyy toooo sweet for my liking. The cream filling....bleh....over powering. I much prefer a gelato or something if I ever get a chance to come back here.  Overall, this is a really good restaurant and I can see it thriving here at The Palazzo. Prices aren't as expensive as say, Dal Toro or Bouchon. If you're in the mood for Italian and kind of on a budget.....I definitely recommend Buddy V's.  (P.S.) Heard Buddy V is going to open up a bakery shop at the Venetian sometime in March 2014. Stay tuned!",

We already had dinner plans elsewhere, but we had to try their desserts. We shared the lobster tail pastry and the warm Nutella cake with salted caramel ice cream. The lobster tail was amazing, with perfectly flaky layers and a sweet creamy filling, served with berries on the side. The Nutella cake didn't have as much Nutella flavor as we were hoping, but delicious nonetheless. The real star was the salted caramel ice cream!

    "text": "We went to Buddy's on our first night in Vegas.  The atmosphere was great and I really liked the decor.  Our waiter looked just like Buddy's cousin and had a great personality.  I started with a Caesar salad that had more dressing than lettuce.  the best part was the soft croutons on top.  A bowl of those would have been awesome.  Salad, not very good. I then just wanted meatballs and the waiter talked me into pasta and meatballs.  The balls were small and not very flavorful.  My wife had chicken marsala.  there were 4 full breasts in the order.  it was a huge portion.  She liked it. We passed on dessert in order to gamble sooner.  Overall, the food was ok but the price for what we got was too expensive.   The next night we went to Lavo in Palazzo and spent $20 more per person and had a way better eating experience.  Do yourself a favor, and stick to Buddy's Bakery across the hallway and skip the restaurant. Too many better options in and around the Venetian.",

    "text": "Went for a birthday celebration and they made it nice with Happy Birthday written in chocolate on the dessert that my daughter selected. Food was fantastic--cheesy garlic bread to die for, meatballs yummy, eggplant parm and dad's bucatini great. Flatbread pizza wonderful too. Portions are very generous. Several people had chicken piccata or chicken marsala and said there was too much chicken but that's a good thing! Had cannoli and warm nutella cake for dessert--great!  Now my concerns---service left a lot to be desired starting with the bar. We arrived early and had drinks then were ready to move to dinner but the bar made a huge thing of needing to close out our tab there first (3 drinks, one of which was a happy hour drink, so not a big tab!). Okay that's fine but then it took forever to get the waitress to come so we could close out. Not good.... and then at our table the waiter was very nice (Rocko) but not very efficient nor was his helper. We had to ask for olive oil and vinegar for the bread and they brought one for the table of 6 so we asked for another and never got it. Later in the evening we asked for two decaff coffees and those never came.   We were not in a hurry so it was fine but they need to look into these issues. Would definitely go back for the great food!",

I had the linguini and white clam sauce, it was delish. I also appreciated that most dishes were slightly under salted. The flavors really came out. But, if you go for no other reason, go for Giorgio!  Even though the place was crazy busy he took the time to give us special service. I've been in family-run trattorias in Italy and that's how Giorgio made us feel, just as if we were in his family's kitchen. It's Buddy's, don't skip dessert!  We had the Italian birthday cake and, Giorgio you were right. It made me forget about run-of-the-mill tiramisu!",

Sat at a table with a view of the open kitchen.  Thin breadsticks individually wrapped at each table.  Great calamari fritters appetizer. Crispy and nice marinara sauce on the side. Ordered Clams and linguini.  They were ok.. chewy clams, very light on garlic, but substantial portion. Friend ordered vodka sauce rigatoni with chicken.  Good sauce, chicken breast a little tough but all around not bad. We opted not to have dessert with our meal since we were full and instead went 'across the street' to Carlo's Bake Shop. I've never been to the original one in New York, but I'm guessing they serve many of the same items in Vegas. It was just as crowded as the restaurant if not more.  There is a large window to view the pastry chefs/bakers decorating the cakes - a great way to pass the time while you are waiting to get your desserts.",

I don't entirely blame her I would probably have a bad attitude if I was all by myself on a Friday night . The part that really mad me mad was that there were 2 managers just standing around doing nothing. When I asked one of the managers if he could help he said we had to wait for the the hostess and he couldn't help us. When we finally did get seated we were sat in the bar. That would of been fine but in the bar they had one waiter to take care of the entire bar area while the two managers sat and ate at the bar. The food took for ever and they even showed up with the wrong food for my mother and that took 15 minutes to get her food while we starred at are food till she got hers .the food was just alright and way over priced. I was disappointed",

The best part was their adaption if chop salad for a lunch salad it was huge! Save room for dessert, we had the famous lobster roll and the most Devine Italian rum cake served in a miniature cake stand complete with candles for the birthday girl! We can hardly wait for the bakery to open trust we will be the first in line!

He found one for us in about 3 minutes.   Adam spent about 5 minutes with us going over the menu with us and telling us the history of the restaurant and Buddy. After we got our drinks, Adam came buy again and was going to take our order but we told him we could wait for our server. Adam was very personable and made sure we were taken care of. Way beyond your typical GM.  Now the food, we both ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. I am Italian and am very picky about my Italian food but it was excellent!!!

First we had reservations for a 10pm; there was 10 of us in our party. Prior to making reservations they told us that the kitchen would close at 11pm but we can order anytime prior. Well the \"water boy\" was very nice and polite. The server was the complete opposite. Very rude just no personality. He just kept rushing us. We had just sat down and already asking what we would like to drink. We never got a chance to look at the menu. The water boy came asking if we preferred flat or sparkling water (never where we once told or notify that whichever one you choose you would be charge $5.50 per cup) get out of here with that. I don't mind paying that's not the point but really. If I was going to be charge that then I would of asked for something other than water. We also mention to the waiter if we can do separate checks he mention he can do up to 4 transactions. Which we were fine with. We were also celebrating people in our party birthday. I don't know why it took 20min after we eat to bring out the birthday dessert. Are you kidding me! We asked for the check and the waiter brings us 1 whole check. After we said it was ok to separate it in 4 checks. We didn't say anything cause at that point we were all frustrated with the waiter and just wanted to leave. While I and another individual in our party are trying to figure out totals and cash. At that point another person in our party notice that our waiter was laughing at us trying to figure things out. . At that point we just paid and did not leave a tip. The place is beautiful the food is delicious. But i will never eat here again. Unless I can order and take it home but nope. Such an unfortunate place because I love the show and I was so excited to eat here but the service sucked. I really hope that they can trained there waiters to have better costumer service or if you close at 11pm don't do reservations at 10pm. Maybe this person wanted to leave and that's why he was rushing us? But who knows? nobody deserves this service.",

The first thing I noticed about this restaurant was that it has a very cozy feel. Great place for family or a romantic night out with your significant other. We had a large group so we were seated toward the back of the restaurant. No complaints there because there was a huge window by our table that overlooked the strip. Our waitress was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. She took the time to help us order... all 12 of us which I thought was great. For the appetizer, they offer a very flavorful bread with baked on cheese. So not really a cheesy bread. The bread was soft and came with a balsamic and olive oil mix. It was so delicious. For the main course, all of the meal come in very large portions. The menu offerings are also kind of pricey. I simply ordered their meatball appetizer because I wasn't very hungry that night of our trip. The meatballs were delicious. The dish came with about 6 meatballs for about $9. I also sampled my friends' meals and everything everyone ordered was delicious. I would absolutely recommend this restaurant if you want a nice, authentic Italian meal. My only regret is not have a big appetite the night I visited this restaurant so that I could have tried a full size meal. Maybe next time!",

We each orders from the Prix Fixe menu....I got the Tomato/Basil soup, Chicken Parmigiana and the Tiramisu. Everything was perfect!!! I'm always on the hunt for good tomato soup and it was delicious!!!!! My husband ordered the meatballs, carbonara, and canoli and he said everything was yummy as well!   Our server was great and attentive...she was training another server but it was never awkward or intrusive. The manager came over also to check on us and wish us a Happy Anniversary. The restaurant was very busy, even for a Wednesday night, but we never felt neglected....we always had people checking on us. We had a great experience!!",

Our waiter spent 15 minutes trying to push the family style dinner but wouldn't give us a price...told us it would range between 40-65 per person at the chefs discretion. It was like dealing with a used car sales man. He would not let it go even after we told him we were just ordering off the menu. He then tried to up sell us on everything. Made for a a super uncomfortable experience. Sad because the food is delicious. I'm not sure if this is was just a issue with our waiter...or if this is how the place operates.",

    "text": "Came in with my boyfriend for my birthday on January 19th. We had reservations at 7:00 and even though we were about 10 minutes early we were seated right away. I really liked our table as it was right next to the window overlooking the Strip. The restaurant was busy but not overly packed.   This is where it started to go downhill. We sat for almost 15 minutes before my boyfriend had to flag down a busser to ask him to call our server. We hadn't even been poured water or given bread at all. The busser was nice enough to bring us both, telling us that our server would be right with us. 20 minutes goes by before our server even acknowledged our presence. What was really disturbing was that she was the waitress for the table directly next to us and had been walking right past us and using the register right next to us the whole time! I would not expect service like that from this type of establishment. Especially when it wasn't even very busy.   We ordered the mac 'n' cheese carbonara for an appetizer and it did not disappoint. It was very tasty and just the right portion size for the two of us. I decided on the chicken parmesan while my boyfriend got the spaghetti and meatballs. The food came out quickly and was delicious.   The only complaint was of the service and lack of attention from our server. Every time my boyfriend tried to get her attention to let her know it was my birthday she would ignore him. She seemed very preoccupied with a table of older men. I understand she saw a big tip but it kills the restaurant's reputation as there are many different groups of people who come in to dine.   It was good but there are other Italian restaurants in LV that have better food and prices with much better service. I have to say it really bummed me out that this experience wasn't what we had hoped for as it was a special occasion that we had been looking forward to for some time.",

The price of the drinks have skyrocketed as well.  The pasta is not fresh.   For the price of Buddy V's pasta, you have to offer some fresh pasta.  The deserts were actually terrible.   Not sure if Buddy V has actually dined at this restaurant for a while.  The quality has defiantly decreased.   We will not be going back here.",

I thought there could've been more food choices in the buffet. They had a crepe station but only offered two fillings, they had a decent mix of sweet and savory dishes to choose from though. We went up three times to refill our plates, and I enjoyed everything I ate. We loved the Bloody Mary bar! Such a cool addition! They also had live music which added a nice touch. I would recommend to anyone who loves a good brunch.",

    "text": "We had the opportunity to visit the new Buddy V's at the Venetian Las Vegas. We found the outside menu to be very interesting and the offer of happy hour irresistible!  unfortunatly, the man we met at the front desk did not share our excitement.  He acted irritated with our presence, but when asked, directed us to the upper level of the restaurant as the appropriate area for happy hour values.  after selecting a place to sit, we were accosted and told not to sit \"there\" as \"that\" isn't happy hour seating, \"this\" is happy hour seating.  (beware the hi top tables as they angle your drinks to the floor). Our poor waitress (April) seemed very unhappy to see us. She described a few of the beverages when asked, but after ordering \"bellinis\", she told us the Bellini machine was broken. When asked if the drink could be served on the rocks, she acted shocked and said it was impossible as it was made from a mix. We heard the bartender say the machine wasn't quite ready. When quizzed, the waitress said it wouldn't be ready for \"hours!\". We settled for the house red, and let me tell you, i do mean settled.  the transparency of the liquid lent itself more to watery cool-aid, with legs and bouquet to match. We did sample a pasta appetizer, which might have lead us to believe the food was worth putting up with the service, but a smart phone app lead us to better Venetian opportunities. Our party was met with a hostile glare as we were fleeing the establishment, and i was forced to resort to mad dogging the man(ager?) to make good our escape.  greeting cold, directions sketchy, service irritated, food potential but unknown, farewell hostile.  1/2 star....",

We asked both the hostess and the manager (both rude and short) if we could sit and have a drink and we were told no, but you can go to the bar and get a drink.  Since a few of us worked in the industry, we understand the policy when it is busy, but when it is not I would think a good manager would make the right decision.  We felt like Greg Focker in Meet the Parents when he wanted to board the plane.   That's OK, Canaletto happily sat us (they were slammed btw) and enjoyed taking our $250 lunch tab along with the 2 additional friends who came when we were finished of our referral.",

    "text": "Buddy is more than just the boss of cake...he's the boss of FOOD in general!  I can't even begin to describe how excited I was when my stepdad told us that we were going to have Christmas dinner at Buddy V's in the Venetian.  I was the only one out of our family of four who even knew who BuddyV was!  Can you believe it?!  Okay, so Christmas night we head to the Venetian from the Bellagio expecting more traffic than there actually was.  But it's a good thing we left when we did because maneuvering through the Venetian was a fete in and of itself!  I won't fault the restaurant for this - for all we know, there could have been a short cut that we had no clue about.  Also what we didn't know that CARLO'S BAKERY was right across from the restaurant, complete with viewing glass into the bakery!!  Of course I got pictures ;)  So, walked right up to the hostess at Buddy V and got seated immediately by the window facing The Strip.  It was a beautiful evening with a nice view. EVERYONE we encountered in the restaurant was amazing.  My 3 other party members all ordered Buddy's Christmas Prix Fixe menu (in photos) which consisted of butternut squash soup, crusted prime rib, smoked mashed potatoes, and a chocolate Yule log for dessert.  I opted for steak and lobster  with a side Caesar salad as I am not a fan of butternut squash...or prime rib for that matter.  We were greeted with freshly baked bread topped with a wonderful herb mixture.  The server's assistant brings it out on essentially a cast iron sheet seemingly straight from the oven.  No butter is offered, but they provide an olive oil and red vinegar mixture.  Most of us got full just off the bread!  Oh!  And breadsticks are waiting for you at your table when you're seated - not the Olive Garden kind, but the kind that come pre-packaged in wrappers and are very crunchy.  Our server brought out my salad the same time as the others had their soup.  I did try the soup and it was, surprisingly, very good to my non-butternut squash-loving palate.  There seemed to be a delicious marshmallow cream on top.  The entrees arrive and they are positively beautiful!  I ordered my filet medium well, but after I had finished half my lobster and took a bite of my filet is when I noticed that my steak was far from medium-well...it was literally still bleeding.  My mom apparently did not know that prime rib generally comes with quite a bit of pink to it so she had me flag down our server to ask him to have the kitchen cook our meat a little longer.  The server was very gracious and apologetic but we were quick to let him know it was not his fault.  Before long, the manager made his way to our table to profusely apologize for the mistake in our meat temperatures and offered to bring us more soup or an appetizer to apologize - wish was amazing - but we declined as we knew it would be too much food.  When the server came back out with our corrected order, to my mom's surprise (but I kind of figured this would happen), they actually brought out two fresh dishes!  We were beyond thankful!!  To top it off, our server let us know that his manager put our first round of drinks on the house!!  I mean, this was impeccable service!!!  We couldn't have asked for a better experience.  Buddy V's deserves all the accolades it can get and I absolutely cannot wait to return!  OH!!  How could I forget that I just HAD to order one of Buddy's famous cannolis.  I had never eaten a cannoli before so why not start with the best?  The cannoli's presentation (as well as the entire meal) was wonderful!!  Two different cookie-flavored ends and a scrumptious chocolate caramel sauce that I just wanted to drink!!",

    "text": "During a search for the perfect birthday cake we were excited to find Carlo's Bakery located in the Venetian. Everybody loves the Cake Boss! Directly across from Carlo's is Buddy V's. They were happy to make our reservation for 7 and even seated us early.   I stepped out of my normal lasagna comfort zone and order the grilled salmon. The presentation was perfect but unfortunately I have a terrible time controlling my facial expressions. The mashed potato portion would have been gone in about 4 bites. I said it was fine, but within a few minutes our waiter returned to the table with another side dish of potatoes and I must admit a tear of joy was shed. The food wasn't as expensive as we expected so we also ordered a bottle of wine.   Can't forget the cake! The birthday girls fittingly got the Italian Birthday Cake.",

The only reasons I'm giving my review a 4 star instead of a 5 star is because the drinks cost more than I thought was necessary and the constant attempt to up sell me at every encounter. Our server was not rude about it but it was more or less annoying. This is my first time to Vegas so I knew things would be costly but it shocked me.   I ordered the lasagna and after my first bite, I quickly knew that it was the best lasagna that I've ever had! My husband had the chicken parmigiana and it came with two chicken breasts! Come hungry or prepare to share a meal because we both left with enough food to feed us two or three times over!",

Panzanella salad:4 stars (but u need to ask for more dressing-which is like a balsamic shallot mayo-yummy!). Salad was spring mix, but crouton, soft cheese, and tomatoes made up for by having multiple textures.   Steak pizzaiola: 5 stars. Sirloin steak that taste prime quality grill to well done perfection as ordered with minimal charring. Over a bed of cheesy polenta and topped with roasted tomatoes that helps give it just enough saltiness for the steak.   Salmon: 2.5 stars. Well cooked and beautiful presentation but lacked flavor. The acidity in the veggie malange under the salmon would have balanced the flavors well, but the salmon had no taste.   Tiramisu: 3 stars. Hubby liked it. Didn't care for it too much.   Canoli: don't know if it's just me but only 2 stars. Tasted heavy and not much flavors.   Maybe next time we will pick something else instead of the prix fix.   Oh the cake boss cocktail:5 stars. Sweet cocktail for those who have a sweet tooth. Chocolate liquor with creamy Bailey depth and cake crumbs.",

And for lower prices come here during non-prime time hours like 2-5 or something like that.  Free complimentary bread and breadsticks and main courses that are less than 25$ . Good deal.  And shoutouts to the servers/manager/busser for being able to handle my rowdy friend. The manager was very kind enough and astute when she realized the forfeited expense of the extra side pasta was most certainly not worth battling his brash behavior.   Ordered the popular chicken Parmesan. Chef was able to bake it exactly how it should be: moist and cheesy with a lighter breaded exterior.  Side rustic pasta was fresh, nicely seasoned and even better with extra fresh Parmesan cheese.",

Slightly negative remarks-the tables are dainty, and with it being family style, things can get crammed real quickly and the restaraunt music was a little too loud for my taste. Also, the lady who answered the phone when I called to check the wait literally just said \"hello\" no thank you for calling blah blah. Really unprofessional. Other than that, everything else was awesome. Our waitress was attentive and kind. The food came out in an orderly fashion. We received complimentary bread for the table and ordered garlic bread in addition, though the garlic bread was good, it was unnecessary. The caesar salad was good, croutons were weird. The croutons were soft, cheesy with a hint of lemon. I've never had anything like it but wasnt a fan of that part of the salad. Now.... for the star of the night, the chicken parm! The chicken was so thick and juicy, with a nice even layer of cheese and marinara on top. The spaghetti that accompanied was prob the best red sauce I've ever had. Now.... I love me some good maggianos, but this beat their chicken parm! The noodles were perfectly al dente, perfect amount of sauce and such good flavor. We ordered the tiramisu-good, not great. And the cannoli! The cannoli was really yummy. We will be back because it was so stinking good.",

Maybe other people don't put citrus in their seafood pasta.) The pasta itself was cooked right, and the sauce was good too. I'm docking a star for the overdone clams which are what I look forward to in a clam linguine. For $24, it was eh...I think that pasta dish was more $17-18 quality. The other stuff on the menu might be better though; my veal was good, and hopefully the clam linguine was an outlier.",

The restaurant is very open and spacious which I really liked!   To start, we were provided warm foccacia bread which was oh so yum! We ordered the lasagna and the linguini and clams. Both entrees were so good and super filling. The food is also very affordable which I liked. Next time I'm in town, I'll definitely be back to try other dishes on the menu!",

    "text": "My sister and I made reservations at Buddy V's after the Las Vegas Half Marathon in November. We wobbled our way over to the Venetian after we had our showers back at our hotel (Flamingo).   For those that don't know, the Las Vegas Half and Full Marathon are at night, so we were eating dinner probably at like 10pm. I was actually surprised at the modern, upscale interior of Buddy's. I was expecting a layout similar to an Olive Garden or Buca di Beppo, but this place is definitely higher end.   We were seated near a window, which we really enjoyed because we got to people watch down below and see people finishing the marathon.  Although we were worn out, we needed to refuel. As much as I normally would have loved a glass of wine at this kinda place, I stuck with water since I felt dehydrated. I ordered a side Caesar salad for starter and the spaghetti for my main meal.   The Caesar was okay. The dressing wasn't as flavorful and the croutons are really weird. They are not your normal croutons. They are soft and essentially taste like funnel cake. I didn't love that but what do you expect from a pastry chef? I only finished maybe half the salad.  The spaghetti was good. I enjoyed the sauce and the overall flavor was good. Although, it was nothing to write home about. Pretty baseline spaghetti.  All in all, this place is a pretty standard Italian restaurant with an upscale, modern feel. Their price points are very reasonable and it's seated at a great location, so if you're looking for a non-chain place in Las Vegas, this might be a good option for you.",

First of all, the hostess and waitresses are very kind and attentitive. They were also informative as well since they knew it was our first time here at Buddy V's. I ordered bottomless mimosas, but you could also change your drinks to a sangria or a Bellini! I thought that deal was one I had to take! Their food was delicious! I loved their tomato soup and the ham that they served. I also loved the scrambled eggs and the mini crepes they had. Their \"Grandma meatballs\" were also very flavorful and satisfying  I've been to the brunch buffet in Paris but I've got to say this Sunday brunch buffet tops Paris!   I can definitely see myself coming back here again, my only complaint would be that the area is too cold. I think if they raised their tempurature it would have been more comfortable for me but everyone in my party was so cold, which was the only reason why we wanted to get out of there.",

    "text": "What a nice place to eat! Not too fancy. Not too cheap. Great for families! It wasn't the best in flavor since most everything was on the bland side but it was still good.   Chicken parmigiana- a bit bland chicken. Needs a bit more spices. Still good to eat though! Spaghetti was yummy! Some Italian places make this dish too salty so I preferred it more bland and adding a bit of salt.   Prime rib- yes, at an Italian restaurant. Not the best to order but it was a prix fixe meal so we tried it. Prime rib was also a bit bland, but again, better than salty, which I've gotten too.   Lou's gravy- meat lovers would love this one! All kinds of meats- sausage, meatballs, lamb, I forgot the others. Husband loved it! He said it was actually too much meat. That's not often heard of.   Clam spaghetti- seasoned on the bland side again but clams were juicy and not chewy.   Garlic cheese bread- now that was delicious!! I could have more of that!! We're ordering more of that next time.   Customer service- 5 star rating!! The young gentleman was very accommodating. He was so patient with my son too. When asked why there was no star on the Xmas tree, he said he wasn't sure but he would look into getting one next year. He then took my son to see a bigger tree at the back of the restaurant to check for a star. He said he'd tell the manager that that tree needed one too after confirming with my son. The extra help in getting out dishes and filling our cups were so \"johnny on the spot\" too!!! Loved every bit of the wait staff!!!!!",

The restaurant is big and beautiful, with an awesome view. Everything we ordered from the menu (and i mean everything) was delicious!! We even ordered few dishes twice. The service was quick and amazing. The servers were all polite, kind and friendly. What an awesome experience.  We will not miss that restaurant in any trip to Las Vegas, for sure.

I ordered the lasagna and grammas meatballs. The meatballs and tomato basil soup was so good. I could barely get started on my lasagna but the few bites I did take were Devine. I had to get a go go bowl. X since I didn't have a microwave to eat it later, I put it in my room fridge until it was time for me to go then I carefully wrapped and packed it and brought it home to Houston.

I'm not sure if that's the norm, because I was there with my husband and a company dinner. We had some of everything. Lasagna, calamari, filets, scallops...and several more items. EVERYTHING was good. The lasagna and calamari were my favorite. So flavorful and presented beautifully.   I am in Vegas a few more days and I will definitely be back for round two.",

Spaghetti sauce was very fresh with ripe tomatoes. My dish was flavorful and not too heavy for a cream-based sauce. The complimentary bread was also tasty. We did not try the dessert here, but wish we had because Carlo's Bakery across the way was a disappointment compared to this restaurant. Next time, we will order dessert here and see if it's better than the quick stop place.",

After going on a mission to find this spot for something sweet - my two friends said it all looks like supermarket bakery items and didn't order- wtf? We worked too hard to get here! I ordered a hazelnut mini cream puff (about $3 or $4 I don't remember exactly- a little pricey for its size but not crazy). The ordering part sucks ballls! You order with one person then another bags it up, while you wait on yet another line to pay then another to pick up.  There were only 4 people in front of me and this ordeal took 20 minutes! This is where they lost a star.  I finally got my little golden chocolate hazelnut nugget- and OMG!! So good.  Worth all the hassle- I didn't even share with my friends- who judged this pastry by its cover.",

I called in a week ahead and made reservations for a Friday night. They were accommodating and I called the night before to confirm the reservation. The place isn't hard to find, but it can be better described..I was told it was across Barney's, but there are many levels and entrances. Anyhow, we were seated promptly, but without menus. The waitress came by a few min later and described that they do family style or menu if we prefer. We preferred the menu. Since we were pretty hungry, I ordered 2 fries for our table and we all ordered our food- some of us to share the meals.  The fries came, and they were mediocre. Then someone came by with warm bread for the table- I wish they did this sooner so we knew. Or even mentioned it. Anyhow, food arrived and it was fine. I shared the chicken parm and it was decent. No one complained about the food, but no one raved about it either.  It did take some time for the check and then for them to come back to collect it.  Would I go here again? Maybe but it wouldn't be my first choice.",

    "text": "Celebrity chefs have let me down before in Vegas, but I was pleasantly surprised by Buddy V's. For a man known for his cake, he can dream up some good Italian food.  You may be shocked by the prices at first (well probably not it is Vegas), but the dishes are served family style. Yes, you can realistically share a dish with someone else. (My exception to this would be the spaghetti.) The Cesar salad was crisp and coated in dressing and could easily be split between two or three. There are very few options for vegan's or people who don't want dairy, but you can opt for the Spaghetti Pomodoro. Usually, I do not like spaghetti at restaurants because most of the time I can DIY. However, the flavors of the sauce were fantastic. Super tasty my only gripe is that in comparison to everything else the portions were tiny. Luckily you can load up on the deliciously garlicky, buttery, and cheesy bread. This place seems to stay pretty busy, so get there early. In a world of lackluster name driven Chef restaurants don't be affraid to take a chace on Buddy V's Ristorante.",

Pros  Macaroni & Cheese Carbonara: One of the most decadent and rich mac & cheese I've had. Although the pancetta was lacking, the cheese sauce was pure heaven and the penne pasta was cooked just right.   Aunt Nina's Mozzarella Corozza: It's pretty much a delicious version of the grilled cheese sandwich filled with plenty of mozzarella and pesto that is placed on a chunky bed of ragu. The only dislike I had about this appetizer was that the sandwich was drench in too much olive oil for grilling.   Margherita Pizza: A simple pie that was baked to perfection with a perfect ratio of mozzarella, tomato, and basil.   Overall great dining experience with delicious food to start off the day. I definitely will return and also will be saving room for dessert to try out his popular bakery, Carlo's Bakery that is located across the restaurant.",

That doesn't mean the food is bad, but Buddy V advertises and charges like it's something more.    On a side note the lasagna was a massive block of melted cheese, it was very heavy.

We were fine with some of the delays because they were extremely busy. After our meal was over our waitress returned with our boxed leftovers and what seemed like our check in hand and asked if we wanted dessert. (The couple sitting next to us, had received dessert and the gentleman who had been singing thanked them for celebrating with Buddy V's). Since no one had mentioned anything about what we were celebrating, I mentioned to our waitress that I had noted that we were celebrating our honeymoon when I made the reservation because we had gotten married two days ago. I asked if they do anything for special occasions and she said that they could write congratulations on a dessert. It took about another 10 minutes before our waitress returned to ask what we wanted for dessert. By that time we had decided that we didn't want to wait any longer. Overall, the food was really good, but the disorganization and the lack of attentiveness even when we mentioned celebrating something was a little annoying. The waitress was pleasant enough and the food was good.... but so many things were overlooked and delayed that it kind of ruined the experience.",

If you're coming for the Happy Hour you have to sit in the bar area but there's plenty of seats and it's very comfortable.  Great view of the strip can be seen from most seats, as well as TVs for watching the game.    I began with a $4 house red wine and then ordered the sausage and pepper sliders, veggies and olives, calamari, gnocchi, and meatballs.   I would specifically say the calamari has a very nice texture to it and isn't too crispy.  In addition, the meatballs are simply outstanding.  The gnocchi is a bit weird as it's not the typical pasta variety, but instead a cubed pasta variety.  Still tasty, but not what I imagined when ordering.  The sliders were great and come 2 to an order.  And the olives and vegetables were a nice addition to any meal with crispy, tasty bread to add.  The pizza was actually very good as well with sausage and fresh cheese.  I had to get a pinot noir by the glass added to my order off the main menu to compliment the meal.  In total, I got out of a Las Vegas strip restaurant with all of that food and 2 drinks fro $60.  What an incredible deal.  This place is a must for Happy Hour (until 6:30pm) and I imagine their main dishes are just as good.  I had high hopes coming into Buddy V's given their association with the Honey Salt and Andiron team, but this Happy Hour and my experience overall was just phenomenal.",

They serve the best warm focaccia bread with olive oil & balsamic while you wait.    We both had the linguine & clams with sides of polenta and broccolini.  Usually when you order linguine & clams you get very few fresh clams in the shell.  It's typically just enough to add some theatrical value.  But this place piles them on.  We both were given a lot of fresh clams in the shell.  The white wine sauce was excellent and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.  There was no room for desert so we didn't get to try any of Buddy's famous confections.  Next time.  Only complaint... When you're coming from the valet parking garage the place is sooo hard to find.  The signage in the Venetian isn't very good and every person you ask sends you a different way.  We walked around that enormous hotel for more than 20 minutes looking for this place and almost gave up.  The staff acknowledged that it happens frequently.",

The food was good. We had meatballs and spaghetti, chicken parmesan, and Mediterranean Sea Bass. My sea bass was tasty and came with a nice side salad. The food was all good but I wouldn't consider it excellent. A huge disappointment was being charged $10 for a glass of tea.

That said,  and it needed to be, I rarely eat southern Italian in restaurants because growing up in NY, I had the good fortune to eat the real master chefs cuisine,  my grandmother,  father,  aunts and friends parents. Anyway my point is,  I'm seriously biased.   My goal was to eat something tasty and not heavily laden with sugar,  flour, carbs as I'm in the middle of a book about that stuff which is gross, scary and fascinating all at the same time.  But,  I digress.   I went for lunch and ordered grandma's meatballs and a side of Tuscan Kale with roasted tomatoes.  While I get that we didn't use real San Marzano tomatoes here,  it did come close to replicating an authentic flavor.  I should point out that meatballs to Italians is a very serious and personal matter. My extended family can argue endlessly on the what constitutes the perfect meatball, whether there should be inclusions such as pignola nuts, raisens and tons of other stuff you can't possibly imagine.   The Tuscan Kale wasn't on the menu,  but Star, my server,  not wanting to disappoint,  checked with the kitchen and they said they could do it.  I was very happy.  That's service! Problem was,  it came out very tough, chewy and barely edible.  So I appreciate the extra effort,  not the result, and the results are what matters. Once you commit to me, I'm expecting your A game stuff.   Appropriate classic Italian Frank Sinatra,  Dean Martin, Louis Prima and other legends sang in the background. I'll go back ang give them another try for dinner.",

Christia was awesome.  She made me a great martini and then proceeded to help us order.  We had meatballs and a caesar salad to start.  Both yum.  The croutons are made from polenta which was a nice surprise.  We ordered Sea Bass and Chicken Parm for entrees.  Once again, yum! Nutella cake for dessert.

It was a croissant style pastry shaped like a lobster tail filled with cream. It looked really fun, but the pastry was so hard I couldn't cut it with a fork. Other than the dessert everything else was great!",

    "text": "This was our second stop at Buddy V's while visiting Vegas.  First you can't beat the location if you are a shopper.  The restaurant is located in the Canal Shoppes which is one of our favorite haunts while visiting.  What always blows me away is the line across from the restaurant for his bakery, it usually is formed at least halfway down the corridor.  All I can say is the bakery must be delish....but I digress.  We only had to wait 10 minutes for a table at lunch which you can sit in the bar or wait in the corridor.  We were seated in the bar area.  The best way to describe the vibe here is casual chic.  The restaurant feels very open yet has a Brooklyn restaurant feel to it.  Servers are dressed casually and make you feel very comfortable.  I would have liked the server to be a little more friendly...don't get me wrong she was very efficient...just didn't seem happy to be there.  However she gave us great service and everyone has those days so it did not take away from the experience.  I had the eggplant parmesan  which was HUGE and delicious.  No way I could eat it all or even half of it...but I sure did enjoy trying.  Hubby had the spaghetti and loved it.  The cheese garlic bread is like an entree on its own...perfectly toasted with yummy gooey cheese.We both enjoyed the menu as all of the entrees have special ties to the owner like My Wife's Eggplant Parmesan or Lisa V's Linguine, this just gives you the feeling of being in an Italian grandmas kitchen.  Hubby ordered a Buddy V's lobster tail for dessert and I can tell you they look just like they do on his tv show...big and stuffed full of tasty goodness.  I only had a bite as i was still trying to tackle the eggplant parm but it was magnificent.  This is definitely going to become a lunch tradition when we are in Vegas.  Great food at reasonable prices",

We received our caprese salads. It was a pretty good portion. We both agreed our salad needed some more vinegar and a bit of salt. It just tasted so bland. I love caprese salads so this was a real disappointment. We then receive ricotta cheese and bread. Neither of us touch it since we didn't order it. Then we figure out the gnocchi isn't coming.

    "text": "Did you know the owner of this place is like a famous chef or baker or something? Yea, I didn't know either....but I was schooled by my boyfriend's 60-something year old mom. Learn something new everyday!  Our party of 8 came here around 10:30pm on a Sunday evening. We got seated quickly, even with our big party. None of us were very hungry, so we ordered all appetizers or small dishes and a couple of drinks.   My boyfriend and I shared a Margherita Pizza (definitely big enough for two -- has about 8 small pieces). Both my boyfriend and I agreed that the pizza was really tasty! We happily ate the whole thing. It was cooked just right and was hot and steamy when it got to our table. Just the way I like it! I also ordered a Salad...I don't remember the name of it, but it was decent sized and tasted fresh. I was so full on pizza, I couldn't eat my whole salad. I definitely could have just done one or the other.   I don't remember what the rest of my party ordered. There was a variety of dishes, but they all must have been good because I don't remember anything left on anyone's plate when we were done. This means the food was delicious! Or else we were all just hungry. Either way, it was good overall.   Service was great. Our server was friendly and personable. I like that when it comes to servers!  My only gripe was that our food took forever to come out. We waited a good 15+ minutes before anything came out. That was a long time considering they weren't that crowded or busy when we were there. They may need to work out some kinks in the kitchen.   On a side note, this restaurant has good views of the strip. I really liked that, and I spent awhile gazing out at the bright lights and the busyness of the strip. Good people watching!  Overall, I enjoyed my time at Buddy V's. I would definitely come back here again on another visit to Vegas!  Cheers!",

    "text": "Like I said about the bakery, this place symbolizes overrated businesses glamorized by the media for no justifiable reason:  The spaghetti my sister ordered was extremely sour and the flavor was disgusting. One bite of it and my insides starting screaming. Mid-way through the meal, my sister needed to use the restroom.. for a while.   My margherita pizza? Equivalent to the taste and thickness of a napkin. Zero flavor and toppings spread so thin, they must have evaporated upon baking.  After dinner, I left it to Lisa's Nutella Cake with Salted Caramel ice cream to save Buddy V's reputation. I mean, there's no way someone can mess those flavors up - the title alone is perfect. I was wrong. Overly sweet, dense, rich - one bite was too much (and must have contained at least 75g of sugar). The ice cream had nothing salted or caramel about it. I am a huge lover of desserts - and this made me so so sad.  Summary: +long wait, pricey, not good - Why would you come here?",

We came there to get a desert and they gave us a table at lounge area, after we gave the order they asked for my ID which I didn't have with me and told us that we can't seat in that area, first of all we didn't even ask to seat there and they told us to leave and didn't even give us a different table. Why would they even give us a table make us do an order and then tell us to leave? Terrible !!! Terrible service!!",

I seek out Creekstone Farms meat because it's open range, organic, and also happens to be Halal. I called and was told quickly that they do indeed serve Creekstone Farms Beef burgers.   Locating the restaurant was a little tricky but a couple directions later we made it. Inside is beautifully laid out, while not overly fancy, it is classy.   We were seated in a clean red booth immediately and drinks brought right away. The burger was $16. I asked to have the meat cooked away from pork and the server kindly let me know that the only pork they cook is in the meatballs in a pot. The grill only cooks shellfish and steak. Super nice.   Burgers came out with Parmesan fries. Asked for pickles and had them right away. Drinks filled automatically. No breadsticks or other food while you wait. There are some really thin straw like bread sticks on the table that are average.   But all in all, a fantastic experience for lunch. Will definitely be returning on my next trip to Vegas.",

She immediately makes a suggestion which was AMAZING! It had veggies, pasta and they switched the pesto sauce with a tomato sauce! For dessert, she reminded us that the only vegan option was the sorbet! What amazing service and the foods was also astounding!  The atmosphere is casual. Not too busy (Thursday afternoon).

    "text": "For a famous chef, we expected the food to be better than an average Italian chain restaurant. Sorry! We sooooo wanted to love this place. It's the first restaurant we visited when we arrived in Vegas. The Cake Boss is awesome, but he should double-check the menu and service. The place had plenty of empty tables, and now we know why. There are too many amazing restaurants to try in Vegas, but this just isn't up to the hype. Chicken parmigiana and pasta with broccolini and tomatoes were good but no better than average. The appetizers would get four stars. We had the fried mozzarella, which was incredibly plentiful (so share), and the octopus in a flavorful tomato sauce. The grilled octopus was tender, so I would order it again. It's also a unique menu item. The three stars are because of the poor service (with us served food even before we got our drinks, and we asked twice). The waitress also wasn't helpful with the gluten free questions, and there weren't any GF dessert options. Would I return? If this place was at a regular mall, yes. Since it's in Vegas surrounded by other amazing options, no. I should mention, to its credit, the pricing is absolutely reasonable (especially considering it's in Vegas in the Venetian).",

We love the flavors, rich sauces, perfectly cooked meats, and quick, tasty appetizers, almost everything we have ordered here is amazing.   The Service is good and friendly and realized last night what my biggest issue with this restaurant is. The appetizers come out fast, which is awesome, but the wait time between your apps and your entree is excruciatingly long. We ordered plenty of apps to keep us busy but 45 minutes elapsed between apps and entree. This was way too long. I think I blamed the server on my second trip when the same thing happened but I realized the kitchen is just slow to get out entrees and the servers lose attentiveness when they have nothing to bring you. I hate having to ask for more water or a refill.   That being said, I highly recommend Buddy V's, the food is amazing Italian food, the desserts are delicious and the live music was a nice touch last night.   Food:     5 stars Presentation: 5 stars Taste: 5 stars Desserts: 5 stars Service: 4 stars  Waiting for second course: 2 stars General Manager: 5 stars Thanks for the attention and for listening to our previous concerns.",

Offered us the family style, we declined because we have way too many food issues.  Ordered garlic bread for the table, it was fine. We had a few chicken Parms, vodka rigatoni, some pizza, some fish.... not very impressed.  Had just had dinner the night before at Roas, and was far, far more impressed.  Food was overpriced for being \"fine\".  Would not go back.  Did not feel compelled to leave my review until last night's loss, but Buddy clearly doesn't deserve my silence.  What a sore loser.  To be clear, I wasn't going back to his restaurant because the food wasn't good enough and the prices were too high (even before he acted like a child).",

    "text": "Buddy V's Ristorante is a lovely place to go for home-style cooked Italian food.  The menu offers a variety of appetizers, salads, pasta, chicken, veal and seafood.  Last but not least, the cakes are insanely delicious- not surprising, seeing the restaurant is owned by the Cake Boss himself.  Do whatever you have to do to save room for dessert!  Our server brought us a tray of freshly baked focacia before the meal.  It was so fluffy and warm.  i could have eaten a whole tray myself!  My sister and her boyfriend shared some of their fried calamari appetizer.  It was great!  The cocktails were wonderful.  I tried my sister's martini called the Cake Boss- red velvet cake, chocolate liqueur and Bailey's.  The restaurant sadly did not offer any Alfredo entrees, which are typically my favorite, but my Chicken Piccata (breaded chicken cutlet in a white wine & butter sauce) was excellent!  The side of pasta was also very good.  I tried my mom's Eggplant Parmesan and was very impressed!  The food truly tasted like we were eating a homemade dinner at a family member's dining room table.  Even though we loved our meals, the best course of the meal was dessert.  I had trouble deciding what to order.  The Cannoli, Butterscotch Creme Brulee and Nutella Cake all sounded so good.  Our server recommended that I try the Italian Birthday Cake- Rum soaked sponge cake with cannoli filling, chocolate pastry cream and toasted almonds.  It was heavenly!  The restaurant's ambience is perfect for a nice family dinner.  It is beautifully decorated with a combination of vibrantly colorful kitchen items and upscale decor.  The restaurant has an energetic and happy atmosphere,  They commonly have upbeat live music playing, but at a reasonable level so you can hear the people at your table talking to you.  The service is also amazing.  The employees make you feel like old friends of theirs- definitely the ideal Italian kitchen.",

We were seated promptly at the reservation time and greeted for drinks and water immediately.  I also noticed some plastic packages on the table that resembled chopstick containers and discovered they were mini breadsticks.  Yum.     We ordered salads and the calamari appetizer and they also brought out complimentary bread and olive oil.  Everything was perfect as was the Pino Noir and Cabernet we were drinking.    For the meals everyone tried different dishes which were almost all shared by the time the dinner was over.  We had eggplant parmigiana, chicken parmigiana, spaghetti and meatballs and cheese ravioli.  Everything was spot on and delicious.   I finished my meal off with an espresso and two others shared a butterscotch creme brulee.  As expected everything was perfect.    As you may see from my reviews, I eat out often and across the globe.  This meal, service, ambiance and decor were as good as it gets.  Me and my 3 other guests all had a memorable time and will be back again.  If I can complain about anything, it would be that they should have linen table cloths on the tables instead of the rustic looking wood surface.    Enjoy!",

But my friend wanted Italian for dinner so we went to Buddy V's. She was excited about it.   My absolute favorite, I order it wherever I go, Italian dish is eggplant parmesan. Somehow at Buddy's it is an appetizer, not an entree. Luckily I asked the server and she was able to make it an entree and add a side of pasta. I was nervous, not knowing what appetizer eggplant my look like, but it was delicious. It was layered slices of perfectly fried eggplant with a chunky tomato sauce and cheese. Honestly, I was half starving from walking all day, but I would say this is one of the best eggplant dishes I've ever had. I cleaned my plate.   So, food was fantastic. Our server was pretty mediocre, but I was so happy with the eggplant I don't even care. They get 5 stars from me. I may have to give this celebrity chef more credit.",

My favorite dish was by far the Bone-In Veal Parmesan, but don't forget to start with the Salumi and Cheese board! Both were recommended by our fantastic server Giorgio, and he paired dinner with an excellent wine choice. Portion sizes are huge so come hungry. Don't leave without trying the Cannolis, or go next door to Buddy V's bakery and expand your choices!",

I ordered the cheese stake and it was amazing, the most addicting part of the fries. The menu offer variety of foods with a mix of Italian and American. You can't go wrong, oh and they specialize in desserts! I loved the tiramisu, must get with coffee. This is my second time here and I'm a local. Oh, and free parking at the palazo/Venetian!",

The garlic bread we orders came with three large slices, more than enough to share. I ordered the shrimp scampi. The shrimp were large and juicy, yum! My fiance ordered the chicken Parmesan and he really enjoyed it.  Atmosphere and food were great, the price was fair for the amount of food you get.",

Taste like every other Italian restaurant every where, nothing special or wow factor about it. It was really disappointing to come here and think that the food would be over the top to die for yummy and turns out it was nothing to recommend to friends. Probably my first and last time here, also it is pretty price for the quality of food.",

First, the decor was super fun with bundt cake pans decorating the walls, rolling pin room dividers and light fixtures that looked like giant whisks. Like entertainment too. Although we couldn't see him, his piano and voice could be heard throughout. And a nice variety of music too! Everything from Frank Sinatra to Maroon 5. Now for the food... For appetizers we got some amazing Jersey mozzarella dish as well as a grilled cheese garlic bread. Both were amazing but now looking back perhaps we shouldn't have ordered two cheese appetizers. Cue in the awkward silence... Just kidding! No such thing as too much cheese! For entrees I highly recommend the lasagna, Sunday gravy and orecchiette with Italian sausage and broccoli I. For desert we had some amazing lemon raspberry cheesecake and the Italian birthday cake. Both were excellent! Will definitely go back!",

We arrived with a 1,5 year old toddler and my pregnant wife, they let us wait on the side - even we arrived before the peak time. We needed to ask for a highchair multiple times. Our server (Caleb H, if I can believe the name, what is on the check) was super pushy. He didn't event care about we are with a small child. No plastic cup was offered, not even straw for a child. As soon as we told him nicely we don't want any appetizer, he became even more pushy and extremely rude.   We just wanted to have a nice dinner, and enjoy our first night in Las Vegas, in a special restaurant. Especially because it was the first experience for my mother in law from overseas - who loves Buddy btw, she even went to see his Hoboken cake shop!   After we had our meal, Caleb never came to offer Parmesan cheese to our dish and hardy did any check back on us. It was super obvious, that we received \"different\" service, comparing to the table next to us. We felt really unwelcome.   The food was really delicious and the busser/or server assistant was super nice and caring. He took care of us better, than our server. Unfortunately we don't know his name. He was the only reason we left tip for the server. We hope at least the server treated him better that night, than the paying costumers.   The restaurant was really busy, so we had no chance to speak to a manager. So we couldn't leave any feedback personally.",

What made my mouth drool was the meatball sliders with ricotta cheese. I don't usually like ricotta cheese but it totally made these sliders out of this world. The calamari was also a favorite with having deep fried banana peppers mixed in as well. If you are looking for a good happy hour, this is your place to go!",

The desserts are always ridiculously good, creme brulee and lobster tail are delicious, the desserts are definitely the best part of the meal. Customer service, not so good. Servers disappear or really rush around to where you only see them 10% of your entire visit when it should be more like 40%. Drinks go unrefilled and putting in orders or requests can take a while.  Good food, a little pricey. Just wish the servers would slow down and be more attentative to their tables needs. Wouldn't normally say anything but been here 5 times and noticed this every time.",

The serving size is good for one person, definitely not for sharing especially if you are hungry.  The pasta which we ordered Linguini with clams and lasagna are on the salty side. Actually it is salty. My son who ordered chicken blt like it a lot.  For desert, we ordered creme brulee and canoli. Of course, the canoli is to die for!!! Love it!!! But the creme brulee, i wanted it to be more like a flan but their version is more cream version.",

Calamari: crispy but not chewy, came with some thin sliced grilled lemon, green pepper; an interesting combo.  The fried mozzarella could have been an entree: more like a massive stuffed grilled cheese sandwich with a light marinara sauce. Caesar salads came with fried Parmesan cheese polenta cubes.  What a flavor accent! Carbonara (oh to die for): just enough bits of ham, a good dose of cream and tons of cheese with al dente pasta that tasted homemade. A large enough portion that I got a dogie bag and enjoyed it again the next day. The lobster roll: a flaky layered pastry with a cream filling and surrounded by berries.  Who could not like it? We came as part of a romantic promotion through our timeshare. Both hubby and I agreed, it was a shame we waited until our last day to eat there. Or we would have returned to try other dishes.  The wait team kept us filled with ice tea and water without apparent effort; we never sat with used dishes on the table (one of my pet peeves). All in all, I felt like I was back in the hood, eating Nona's good food with familia.",

I liked a few things: 1) they sat us by the window facing the strip my 2 year old had a great time looking outside and helped me out by keeping her in one place. 2) its brunch so it's all self serve.which is nice because i wanted to try a little bit of everything and no big portions 3) they had the good stuff that i can't get even on a monthly basis...as in meats and seafood. they have a lot of pasta with cheese which is great unless you are watching your dairy. 4) my favorite the pastries!! so delicious... was everything i expected and more! also got the opportunity to meet the pastry chef..she was so nice and welcoming. music playing nice classic songs. best part was it was kid friendly. i saw a lot of children so i wasn't embarrassed when my kids would have she moments. lol   definitely going back",

Ate the meatballs and then the sausage item off the $40 dollar dinner. Also had the Cannoli. Stopped by about 10:30 this evening to tell them. The gal at the front was putting away menus and didn't seem concerned at all, in fact stated \"I'll tell the manager\"continued to put the menus.  I asked her if I was going to get to speak to the manager n she said yes n walked away. He came over after a few minutes. I explained what had happened to me earlier.  His reply was \"what do you want from me\"?  I told him I spent $110.00 plus tip. He said he would take my name and investigate. Not sure what he has to \"investigate\"?!?!?  His name is William Raspberry according to the card that he gave me, after I asked for a card. I would not recommend this place to anyone!!! March 9, have not heard a word from anyone.

Never watched Cake Boss, so didn't know anything about the celebrity status of the chef. We didn't have reservations and tried to get a table around 6:45pm on a Saturday for 2 people. Apparently there was a private event so they couldn't seat us til after 9pm, but luckily there was a table at the bar, so we took that. The bar is a bit noisier than the restaurant, but totally worth it to not wait. Before 7pm, they have a 3 course menu  for $38 which includes an appetizer, entree, and dessert.   Loved the moist and soft Grandma's Meatball appetizer. You only get 3 and they are half dollar sized. For my entree, I got the bolognese. Absolutely delicious and extreme chunky sauce. I also loved the fact that they were very generous w/the sauce so that I actually had plenty of sauce for my pasta! Even had some sauce left over to dip a piece of bread! Got the nutella dessert and thought that it was a tad sweet. Very decadent, but just a tad sweet.",

    "text": "Restaurant week provided the perfect excuse to try Buddy V's. We dined with a group of nine. Service was a bit sluggish at times, but otherwise attentive. They started us with delicious herbed focaccia which paired well with oil and vinegar. I only wish they left the bottles on the table so we could help ourselves. We didn't know upon ordering, but draft beers in the 20 oz and Liter sizes come in a souvenir glass with $9 refills (the cost of a pint). So, that was a nice surprise when ordering a second round.   The restaurant week menu is $40.15 and it came with choice of appetizer, entree and dessert. The majority of the table ordered Grandma's Meatballs, made with beef, veal and pork. They were tender and juicy, the marinara sauce was nicely balanced and flavorful. I was quite pleased. Likely, the second best meatball in town. Those that had the Panzanella Salad seemed satisfied, the mozzarella was very fresh.   The table tried each available entree: Pasta Bolognese, Sea Bass, Carbonara, and Chicken Parmesan. Each were beautifully prepared and damn tasty. My Sea Bass was perfectly seasoned and brightened with a spritz of lemon, the side salad was fresh and light, which was welcomed since I was already pretty full. The chicken parm came with a nice helping of pasta and two lightly breaded baked cutlets topped with mozzarella and provolone cheeses. The pasta across the board was the ideal al dente.   And for dessert we had a choice of tiramisu or cannoli. Both were well executed and scrumptious. I loved dipping the lady fingers into the layers of the creamy tiramisu. The cannoli was filled end to end with sweet ricotta; no hollow center.   I was a little skeptical, but dinner was delicious. Many celebrity chef restaurants fail to deliver, but that's not the case here. It has good eats and casual charm. If you have the opportunity, there's still time to check out the restaurant week menu which is an absolute steal. It's well worth navigating the labyrinth that is the Venetian. Don't park at Venetian like we did, I believe Palazzo self parking would provide better access.",

There was a variety of food offerings and it was all pretty good! I will definitely be back! Service was great. Our server was awesome and informative. The manager Emily at the time was great too! She saw us waiting at the meat station and immediately went to help us and another server went to cut up meat and serve us. Great service great food! The entire staff was helpful and friendly. Came here just because I loved watching Cake Boss but my expectations were surpassed!  Try the mac & cheese and chicken parm... don't pass on the Canola! Thanks to our server Freddy...he was the best!",

    "text": "Phenomenal Italian food, which is what you might expect from a unique restaurant owned by an Italian family. The staff was wonderful as well, from the hosts at the front all the way to the manager who greeted us and had a minute or two conversation with us.   The menu suits itself to family style dining. My wife and I each had drinks, split garlic bread with oil and vinegar, and the pollo rigatoni alla vodka, which is one of the best dishes I've ever eaten. The polenta croutons on the Caesar salad must be tried to be believed. The salad looks so simple that you might be disappointed when it comes to the table vs. my wife's house salad with beautiful heirloom tomatoes, but both were exceptional.  Contrary to many of the reviews I read, they do bring some small bread. Thinking that we didn't, we ordered the garlic bread, which could easily be split between 4-6 people. It was a little much, and if I did it over, I'd leave off the garlic bread and order dessert. We were simply too full!   I'd you're looking for phenomenal food that's not terribly expensive (with drinks and all we were under $80), don't even give it a second thought, and come here. You may want to reserve your table through open table or something similar to get in quickly. Our reservation was delivered exactly on time.",

He provided the right amount of attention to us without being intrusive.  We were a party of 3.  I had the orecchiette and Italian sausage.  It was rich and flavorful, with only a hint of spice, which was exactly what I wanted.  My husband Tim and my friend Gina both ordered the linguini with clams.  They liked it a lot.  I've been friends with Gina for 25 years, and this was probably the only time I've seen her finish an entree at a restaurant!  If you're concerned, don't be; the portion size was generous.  I also had the Italian greens.  They were good and the portion size is large enough for two if you want to share.  We finished with cannoli and apple pie.  Both are worth trying and can easily be shared.",

After all, this guy is a baker not a restaurant chef and every celebrity food person has a place in Vegas and most aren't anything to write home about.  This place is outstanding. Their Cesar salad is a must. They serve it with warm polenta croutons. Talk about a bowl of heaven. Crispy on the outside and full of warm polenta goodness. Yes, I wrote 3 sentences about croutons. They are that good. After that I moved onto the scallops. Sweet, briney with the perfect sear on the outside. Delicious. This has become our must eat at place every time we pass through town. Great wine list, fair prices, excellent service. Worth a visit.  We made a stop for lunch and found the treat of a 3 course meal for $22. I got the Cesar salad, chicken parm with salted caramel gelato. The chicken itself was okay but the pasta was delicious. The gelato was worth a stop in itself.",

This joint is not one of the high end Italian joints that you're used to seeing in Vegas, it's more of a casual dining experience in which you can wear shorts and a t shirt and fit right in. The ambiance is actually pretty nice and the location has some decent views of the strip. The food taste was just average, IMHO... Essentially nothing to write home about, the lasagna was just ok and rather small in portion while the Caesar salad was below average but did have croutons that were awesome (warm and soft). Overall, this may be a good spot to go the next day after a long night out, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.   Pros- Location Service Decor Menu  Cons- Average taste  Pricey",

We ordered the cannoli, tiramisu and large lobster tail. Since we ate lunch, we weren't hungry and thus didn't try the entrees.

    "text": "We visited the  restaurant during brunch buffet. This was s great way to sample what a variety of the menu without ordering everything at once. It's fair to say the food was good but the desserts were amazing. I ate 3 cannolis.  After getting extremely full we walked across the way to the bakery called Carlos Bakery. This is just the retail bakery side of the Buddy V. I am not sure what the deal is but there is always a line down the hallway with stantions. The wait was 45 minutes. You get up to the pastries and wait another 15 minutes to get your name called to pay. It a bit insane to have only 2 cashiers that can ring you up and keep this line control thing going. The people who put the pastries into a box and out your name on it then stand around to get rung up is inefficient.",

    "text": "let me first state the food was good to very good, the service was lame. our server \"Kristi F.\" left us waiting to the point we had to ask a person who cleared tables to have her come by and take our order. She rarely came by never checked on us. We had ordered several fixed menu items, that included desert, yet after the table was cleared from the dinner course she spread out desert menus saying, this and that were good.. We told her we had ordered the fixed menu that was inclusive of such and it seemed rather a  surprise to her, as she collected those desert menus Luckily the two young girls with us were entertained during the obscenely long 2.5 hour meal fest. I am not impressed.  Do not misunderstand me the food was good, the service was quite poor. I did not see a manager walking around, critiquing the troops on their performance and yet obviously it was needed.  The restaurant did NOT appear full, several tables were unoccupied. This adds to my confusion of tonight's performance. Perhaps we caught a bad night for our server and her customer skillset?   We had a table of 7, 5 adults 2 children and 2.5 hours is well too long for a restaurant dinner, that is NOT a  dining experience.  It was lame.    2 stars for food 0 for service..",

Instead, we hadn't finished our salads and our entrees showed up!  As well, the server pulled my salad away and when I explained I wasn't done they acted \"surprised\" when I told them to leave it!  A person who may have been a manager, ( who knows....she didn't introduce herself)...apologized but instead of comping us anything ( like the salad I didn't enjoy anymore) she proceeded to ask if we wanted Parmesan cheese on my entree.    AND as soon as we sat back from our incomplete entree, our check arrived!  Imagine the servers surprise when I told her I wanted another glass of wine.  She was put out because they would mean running our check again.  I don't think this is how The Cake Boss envisioned this.   Save your money if you want a nice, un-hurried dining experience. We especially wanted this to be nice because it was the last night of our honeymoon.  Epic fail.",

The wait staff is incredible! There is the main waiter and then they have another waiter working for the main waiter.  Setting tables, refilling drinks, bringing bread, etc.  It was a very unique concept that I had never seen before.  It made things run so smoothly.   They start you off with some amazing complementary focaccia bread. It is seasoned with some Italian seasonings and cheese. It was piping hot when delivered to us in a very cute basket.  I ordered Nonna's lasagna AL forno. The waiter asked if I was ready for the most incredible lasagna I've ever eaten?! To be honest I was kind of thinking \"ya right.\"  well...  He was right! It really was the best lasagna I've ever had! The presentation was great as well.  It came in a cute little cast iron skillet. We also ordered the garlic cheese bread.  It was good but I honestly liked the focaccia bread better!   You will not be disappointed coming here. The relaxed family atmosphere was very nice! There were pictures of buddy's family on the walls which made it feel like home.  Can not wait to come back here!",

I have been wanting to come to this place for some time as I'm a huge fan of Buddy!!   We show up and get seated very quickly it was about 8:45-9:00pm we are sitting for five minutes when a biased comes to the table and asks us if we would like some water...sure he brings us water...we've never been here before so we are taking our time with the menu and decide to order mozzarella as an appetizer when our server finally arrived at our table we had already drank our glass of water it was a good 15 minutes after we sat down...unacceptable if you ask me! I don't know his name cause he talked so fast and was trying really hard with what seemed like a fake accent to be \"cool\" and laughed at himself....we told him we've never been here and that we would like to order the mozzarella...he then said are you ready to put on your Order for dinner...I said could I have a few minutes he then proceeded to say that I wanted the Veil Parmesan without giving me time to look uhh ok I guess I'll have that since you are in such a rush for me to order when you haven't even put in my appetizer...my boyfriend ordered lasagna... I never saw my server again...well not willingly anyways...I had to flag him down for more water...the buss men were passing out cheese bread and vinegar and oil to every table that was there...except us not once were we offered anything nor where my drinks refilled without having to ask!! I wanted to order a soda and nope didn't even get to do that!!! Our appetizer came was different and so yummy!!! Server never came to see how we where....our food came no server nothing...what if I didn't like my food...oh but I had to flag a biased down again for more water even though they have walked by my table 100 times and I know they seen my water empty!!! So on with it...I had to yell for my server who had been ignoring us after I've asked for him 3 times by a bus man he came I said may I please have a box...10 min later my box arrived...he asked if we wanted desert I said may I see a menu!!(been wanting Buddy's lobster take for years almost went to New Jersey just to try one!!) then my boyfriend asks for a manager cause the special request he set up was to have a lobster tail desert show up to the table as a surprise with writing on the plate saying happy anniversary....my boyfriend was so upset that they ruined the surprised when he talked to the manager he kind of still felt like it was no big deal!! A new server delivered our desert and the comped it(didn't asked them to nor did we want them to)   At the end of everything the SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE! I have been in customer service my whole life never would I treat someone the way we were treated!! We felt abandoned when the people around us where being well taken care of!!!  I give a HUGE SHOUT OUT TO THE KITCHEN THOUGH!! FOOD WAS AMAZING!!! I don't eat leftovers never have my whole life but I did eat the left overs for dinner Saturday!! That says something!!  Just disappointing about the service kind of heartbroken cause j was so excited to finally be going to BUDDY V's",

Place: nice ambience, liked the Cake Boss display of cakes at the front of the restaurant and the his family themed decor and menue was a nice touch.  Get a booth seat or seat by the window.

    "text": "This is a great location and setting. It was crowded for lunch. The hostess took our seating request, but failed to let us know how long to wait would be. After long wait we sat at the bar. The service was average. We got the garlic bread and Buddy's pizza. The bread was great and done to perfection. The pizza on the other hand had tough crust which was burnt on a third of it. This was the end we were to eat last. We wish we had discovered it first with all the gastric issues we experienced. We informed the waiter whom offered no resolution. She just stated it must been a bad oven. Why would a cook let such food go out. Why would the wait shaft not try to make a patron happy. This is not a place I'll risk returning to with so many problems with the staff.",

    "text": "I was at the Venetian/Palazzo Shops when I saw a sign that said \"Carlos Cupcakes\" and \"Buddy V's Ristorante\". We went to Carlos and had an amazing eclair and I saw that across the way there was this restaurant which I found out was owned by the same person who owns Carlos. Anyways let me tell you why this place is amazing.  Service:  It was lunch, so we got in really quickly. We asked to be seated at a window and they did just that! The servers were all really nice and were happy to be doing their job. One plus is that I was really thirsty at the time and they were on top of refilling my water. (5 out of 5 stars)  Ambiance:  It's really beautiful in here. When you sit inside it feels nothing like the craziness of Vegas. It's so nicely decorated in here, and it's huge so you get seated quickly as well as you don't feel crammed or packed! (5 out of 5 stars)  Food:  So we were sinners and had dessert before lunch (to be fair we didn't have breakfast). I said to my family, \"if the eclair is this amazing, then I'd love to see what the restaurant is like.\" My dad wanted to go elsewhere, but I made him come here and all of us were drawn by the selection on the menu. We all ended up ordering Philly Cheesesteaks. Let me tell you, that was probably one of the best Philly Cheesesteaks I've ever had in my life! So flavorful! There were other things on the menu too, like chicken parmesan, pastas, and lasagnas that I saw people eating nearby which all looked amazing! (5 out of 5 stars)  I am for sure coming back! This is our new favorite place. It blew away all our expectations and I am dying to have more of that Philly Cheesesteak!",

Buddy V's, IMHO, could be named BLANK and have the crowds it does based on their food alone. As my Uncle used to say when he called us to the table at one of his BBQ's, \"It's real good and there's lots of it!\". Great service and views along with great Italian food gets 5 stars from me.  WHEN YOU GO- Reservations at night are a must! I recommend lunch and a window seat!",

Our server even made us to go cups of our drink of choice!! The brunch itself was excellent, the Mac and cheese was to die for and so was the dessert table.

    "text": "We made it to Buddy V's at the Venetian!  Tip: Park at Palazzo Valet, walk down to strip and up escalator next to Walgreens for a shorter walk!  We came during Happy Hour, 4:30-6:30 pm 7 days a week. We were here Memorial Day weekend, and it wasn't too full on a Sunday afternoon. The seating in the bar was really comfy with stuffed chairs and couches, high top bar tables with padded seats and bar seating with padded seats with backs.   We tried one of everything on the Small Bites for $5 Happy Hour menu!!!  We also had the Butterscotch Creme Brulee for dessert for $9. So creamy and great butterscotch flavor! It's a good sized bowl, but only about 1/2 inch thick, so not as many calories!  Ricotta cheese was smooth and creamy. It came with grilled buttered bread, and was a great accompaniment to the Olives and Pickled Vegetables, which was served with the same bread. There was enough cheese to also put some on the amazing and Must have Grandma's Meatballs. 3 large beef, veal and pork meatballs with about 1/2 of tomato sauce, sprinkled with a good amount of parmesan cheese. Our other favorites: the Calamari had some big tender pieces that I loved, there were crispy big pieces that that the little tentacles that our friend loved and some fried banana peppers that the spicy food lover liked. My wife's favorite was definitely the Mac and Cheese Carbonara, with smoked mozzarella, fontina, egg, pancetta and peas with a creamy sauce and golden bread crumbs. We got Roma style Gnocchi, which are little fried cubes of polenta with a little metal tub of marinara mixed with pesto dipping sauce-delicious. Crunchy on outside  and smooth inside, great sauce. The smashed meatball sliders was a fun little 2 bite sandwich with peppers on top. Same for Sausage and pepper sliders, which are a bit spicy.   Loved the little to go novelty light up cup for the soda with unlimited refills for $7.   Krystal waited on us, and was very happy and attentive. Manager Kristina Poole visited the table and sat and visited us for a nice chat. We got an update on the restaurant, it's sister restaurant in Bethlehem, PA and Buddy's moms health when we asked. The Assistant General Manager, Sean Fiori, came and whisked her away after a quick picture and check to make sure we were happy.   Very nice evening, could be quick, but this time we stayed and enjoyed ourselves and they were not pushing us out after we paid the bill.  We are here again on 12/18/16 and it's all the same-menu, Krystal the waitress, me and my wife and Flower. She's having the Sangria. No hot chocolate for Tutu, they need to add it to the menu during cold weather.  She got some across the way at Carlos Bakery. Along with Cannoli and a strawberry cheesecake.",

It also took another 30 min to get the bill of us sitting around not having food, empty water glasses in front of us. Other than that I would recommend the cheese bread! It was delicious.",

Neither gentleman batted an eye when I requested a wine glass filled with ice and a lime for my large Pellegrino, and every time near my table they refreshed my drink. They had me feeling fancy!

Hits that sweet spot, where a couple *can* dine for $60 + tax/ tip.    Based upon strong portions, I highly recommend splitting with your dining companion (easier to do on romantic getaway than conference with \"the work guys!\")  On our visit in Dec., 2016, we split: calamari (good flavor), meatballs (yessir!) and chicken piccata.  This latter option had the most absolutely delicious pasta i have EVER HAD.  So much so, that despite the $7 addition, I asked the waiter for an extra side.  Huge mistake: by the time the kitchen made it, my tummy was starting to bloat.  But this is Vegas baby, so we still visited the bakery counter across the way!  One observation: they are really strict/ serious about the Happy Hour ONLY in the bar. As i recall, they were equally adamant that we would have to \"move tables\" to the main dining area (4 feet away) to order off the regular menu.  We didn't fuss with it.  You've been warned : - )  Would return !",

We were a little late because we kept getting lost in the maze of the canal shops, but they accommodated us without any problems.  We were seated by the window in the bar area.  Nice view of the strip below, but it was so loud.  Music was already playing at a loud volume, and then it seemed as if they turned it up even more.  So no dinner conversation for us.  We only like to yell at each other when we're angry.    Lots of choices on the menu, and I almost got meatballs, but I decided to try something else.  The menu had a prix fixed dinner that included a starter, an entree, and a dessert.  So we went with that.  Our starters were the Panzanella salad, and we were served a warm piece of focaccia style bread.  The salad was different than we expected--it contained a lot of greens--but it was still very delicious with fresh buffalo mozzarella and excellent croutons.  My entree was the orecchiette with sausage.  It also contained broccolini and roasted tomatoes.  It was tasty and super satisfying.  My husband's entree was the steak pizzaiolo and it was served with a side of polenta.  It looked good, but my husband was not happy with it.  Difficult to get a steak cooked to his liking outside a steak house.  For dessert, we both chose cannoli.  Very pretty and extremely sweet.  Served with warm chocolate sauce--this part was pretty amazing!  I really enjoyed my food, but it's way too loud inside.",

    "text": "Not bad for on the Strip, but far from the best Italian you can get within the Strip, let alone the Venetian/Palazzo - where Buddy V's can be found.    It's in a great spot on the Strip with some killer views of Las Vegas Blvd.  At night though prepare to be blinded by video screens that are within close proximity of the restaurant.  As far as food goes...We went fairly straightforward with our dining choices.   Grilled Garlic Bread - We did this because you are not served complimentary bread,   Bucatini Carbonara - Probably the best thing we had to eat out of our 3 dishes.  Pretty good flavor and the pasta was al dente.   Chicken Marsala - This was just very meh.  Not much flavor going on, but at least they give you a decent sized portion.    Buddy V's fits a 3 star rating perfectly.  It's not the cheapest place, but it's also not the most expensive.  It's not the best, but it's not the worst.  As long as you know this going in, you will have a pleasant dining experience.",

We first came for dinner with a couple friends. We loved it so much we returned the next day for their Sunday brunch. It been a Vegas go to ever since. They also have a great happy hour! I suggest the lasagna or the mac n cheese carbonara. The Sunday brunch is a great spread and different from other brunches. Of coarse Carlos Bake Shop is just across the hall so definite plus for after meal sweets.",

At the bar, the staff allowed a group of four men to be super loud at 4pm in spite of  everyone in the vicinity obviously enjoying a quiet early dinner late lunch.  The bartender working, my receipt says Matt v., burped during his introduction to me and my mother and did not say excuse me or acknowledge how disgusting it was. I wanted to order the mule but really just decided to not to minimize interacting with him. He seemed to be drinking on the job. His burp was not a small one it was one u would expect from a larger set Middle Aged white man and I think it's unacceptable.   He knew the loud group, they're all cis white straight men and when my mother and I sat down, two women of color,  the conversation became about trump and Obama thinking Kenya is a state and worst when they left he seemed to know them, personally.  It was just really distracting and took away from the experience, I know buddy v is loud and expressive but I think being loud and political is excessive and distracting especially while visiting during the holidays to relax. Unacceptable honestly. The calamari smelled fishy as well when it came out. More than we expected. I didn't try it but my mother expected it to be crispier. I still like buddy v and the show cake boss and I think this could be a great addition to the strip if staff realizes they're at work.",

The fried calamari was a pretty decent size and also cooked well.  We also ordered the octopus appetizer off the regular menu.  It was tender, but sitting in a little bit of a bland sauce and the octopus was a bit burnt on the outsides which made it difficult to eat.  The fresh foccacia bread which they make is yummy.  Very reasonable prices for what you get. Service wasn't the quickest, but they were also pretty busy.  We'll be back!",

    "text": "Yum!!! It's insane how many restaurants there are in Vegas but my friends and I decided on this one because the menu looked good and it was in our hotel. The service was really good. Our waiter took the time to suggest us some appetizers and gave us his opinions on his favorite entrees and pastas. For appetizers, we got the fried calamari and a margherita pizza. The pizza was good and the calamari was really great. The calamari also had fried green peppers which was a little strange and I would have preferred those peppers to just have been more calamari but whatever. It also had really thin lemon slices that were somehow cooked to the point that they were crunchy and they tasted so good with the calamari.  For my meal I decided on the chicken and rigatoni a la vodka because I love pasta with vodka sauce and I don't have the chance to get it a lot. It did not disappoint at all. I loved the pieces of pancetta in it and the pasta was cooked perfectly. Sure it wasn't the healthiest dish (I definitely felt like I needed some vegetables after my meal) but it was delicious so I have no regrets. A couple of my friends got the sea bass and both loved it. Others got the chicken parm and carbonara and everyone enjoyed their dishes.  On to price, is it worth the price? Yes, the food was good, but $24 still is a lot for a pasta dish with sauce and chicken. If it wasn't on the Strip, I would say the prices were ridiculous. However, I think this is one of the more reasonably priced restaurants considering some of the other restaurants nearby. Its good for groups of friends or for families, and I'd definitely recommend it.",

There was nothing typical about the fabulous offerings.   First the all you can drink package included way more variety than what you usually get at a \"champagne brunch\". The options included certain wine, beer, bloody marys, mimosas, sangria AND bellinis. We ended up trying almost everything and I can't say a bad word about any of it. The fruit was so fresh and delicious in the sangria and the red wine and champagne were top quality.    The service was prompt and the waiters and bussers were extremely attentive. Our glasses were never empty, our table was never dirty. The staff was also helpful in making sure we knew where everything was and offered suggestions on the food and drinks.   Speaking of food... The first thing I noticed was that the food was put out in small batches to keep everything fresh. You could really taste the freshness. The Italian offerings were obviously great and I couldn't believe the antipasto area. Everything was so delicious from the fresh, perfectly cooked shrimp to the very flavorful meatballs. I barely left room for dessert. I was able to take one little bite of most things and well... there are no words!  I can't wait to go back",

    "text": "Went to dinner at Buddy V's last night for a friend's birthday dinner. I had been there before, she had not but i raved about it.   We had a 7:30 reservation and showed up a few minutes early. We were seated right away which is always nice. We had a great table with a view of the open kitchen.   Our server came over to bring our drinks but it seemed to take him a rather long time. This would be indicative of the rest of the meal.  As we watched our server he seemed to have tables all over the restaurant so every thing we asked for took a long time.   Come to find out the server did have a servers assistant but it would have been nice if he introduced this gentleman to us so we knew who to ask for what.   The food was good but I would not go back again any time soon.",

The only thing is that they need new bust boys or more training. My first visit, they just weren't up to par esp on refilling the water. I don't remember too much on the last visit what my complaints were. It just wasn't good.   Although tonight, it was crappy. My son was eating the cracker sticks and we placed the opened packet on top of the plates. The guy comes to pass out the plates but dumps the cracker onto the table. Literally took the plate and dumped it. Hello...my son was eating that and what kind of table manner/service is that.   Then they came around with oil. He left and then a few minutes later came with bread. Our waitress finally asked if we wanted balsamic vinegar with it. I said yes, of course. I never had bread with just the oil! I guess the guys did that to the same table as well.   Our waitress was good it's just the bust boys. They're not what I expect for a restaurant like that.",

You must have been really taken care of!\" But no, we found ourselves repeating orders or answering the same question to several different people which became annoying.

    "text": "I used to watch Cake Boss. While I haven't seen an episode in recent times, I recall not only being amazed by Buddy Valastro's cake designs, but wishing I could try some of those hearty Italian meals that he and his family would cook up as well. I finally had my chance to try both the sweet and savory while my husband and I vacationed in Las Vegas.   Buddy V's restaurant and Carlo's Bakery are right across the way from each other inside The Venetian. The line for the bakery was a mile long, so we opted to have lunch and enjoy one of the desserts in the restaurant instead. I loved the feel of the place. It was cozy and warm with large windows to view the gorgeous strip.   They serve warm focaccia bread with olive oil to start. It was so light and fluffy... We both asked for a second piece even though we promised each other we would save room for that dessert! They offer a prix fix lunch special for $22, which is what my husband ordered. You can choose from a few slightly smaller portions of appetizers or salads, entrees or pastas, and desserts. He went with the meatballs, chicken parmesan, and cannoli. I had the whole wheat penne primavera, which included all sorts of tasty grilled veggies. My husband split his cannoli with me... I really didn't give him a choice. :p It was stuffed with sweet ricotta and dipped in chocolate chips and pistachio. Not to diss my hometown of St. Louis, known for its Italian foods and restaurants, but this was the absolute best cannoli I've ever had in my life!   My husband and I both left Buddy V's completely satisfied and determined that we would definitely return on our next trip. Thankfully, we visit Vegas often, so I shouldn't have to wait too long for another cannoli!",

The lasagna is huge and big enough for 2 to share. The salmon lies on a bed of salad and was light and enjoyable.   We also tried the specialty cocktail with the lemon sorbet and it was delicious!   The view of the strip is a great addition to the food. Service was perfect. Would love to come back to try other menu items!",

Its casual too which is great and convenient. No white tablecloth. The portions were perfect. I hate when you get a huge overwhelming plate of pasta and you can't finish it or you overeat. Take my advice and get the warm chocolate cake filled with nutella served with salted caramel ice cream for dessert. It was out of this world!",

Most of the Italian restaurants we've picked thus far have been quite good.  Buddy V's received great reviews from various sites so we made reservations there and gave it a try.  It exceeded our expectations!  First timers or those not familiar with the location of restaurants in the Grand Canal Shoppes should allow time to navigate.  Buddy V's can be a bit hard to find but worth the search!  Upon entering the restaurant we found the ambiance handsome and comfortable...neither too elegant or casual.  Views of The Strip were an added bonus.   The staff was courteous and efficient.  Being Italian food aficionados, we look for entrees that'd are a flavor-packed indulgence when dining out. We asked to split the Caesar Salad, which was kindly plated on two plates, and very good.  The fresh warm cubes of polenta in place of regular croutons were a tasty option.   The warm bread that came with our meal was also very good. I ordered \"My Dad's Bucatini Carbonara\" and my husband ordered \"Valastro Sunday Gravy\" which includes meatballs, sausage, lamb, pork and a bowl of rigatoni in a delicious red sauce.  Both pasta dishes fulfilled our culinary wishes -- generous portions that were delicious!  (reasonably priced for on the Las Vegas Strip)  One of the reviews I read suggested letting them know if it's your birthday, which we did, and were treated with a delicious dessert with \"Happy Birthday\" drizzled on the plate.  Our meal was excellent from start to finish!",

It was slightly on the pricey side though I'll not complain as the experience there was well worth it!",

I ordered the calamari and it was ok. A bit too salty for my taste, but my dinner partner liked it well enough. He ordered the caprese salad and loved it. My other dinner partner ordered the meatballs and was gaga over them. I don't eat meat, so I couldn't taste it.  The wine choices were varied. We all got something we liked. Dinner was phenomenal. I had the shrimp scampi and I was bowled over. Crisp, flavorful, tasty pasta and 5 nice sized shrimps. I had plenty for breakfast the next day.    Two of us ordered dessert. I had tiramisu and he had Nutella cake. I thought he'd lick the plate. I wasn't in love with the tiramisu, but the mason jar presentation was cute.  If you like pasta, give this place a go!  Side note: The live music was wonderful! The waiter kept pushing wine refills on my dinner partner after he says no more, emphatically.",

Joy was our server and she's quite an amazing bartender too! Joy's upbeat and positive energy rubbed off as soon as we were seated. She was very attentive, and had excellent customer service skills. She recommended we try her espresso martini to compliment our dessert plate. WOW. BEST MARTINI I've ever had!!! Ask for Joy!  Jose was also kind and attentive. He took photos of us and made sure we were comfortable.   We gave Joy high accolades to one of the managers (Sean?), sadly he didn't seem interested in hearing our feedback and left the table right away. His attitude was less than impressive.   Thank you Joy and Jose! Thank you to the chefs and kitchen staff for a wonderful meal!",

Awesome views and the service was excellent. Emily the Bartender/Server was on point, we broke two glasses and no one made a fit or said anything, they only care about your satisfaction.

Now let's talk about the brunch! It is totally worth $34.95! ALL YOU CAN EAT for a reasonable price! I rather go eat for brunch than spend that money on a few desserts! Think about it! You can eat as many tiramisu, red velvet cake and so on for one price! Not to mention the delicious grandma meatballs, mac and cheese, chicken, french toast, Italian sausage, and so much more!!

    "text": "This review is for their Spring 2014 Restaurant Week Menu.  Can I tell you how much I enjoy this place? I don't watch \"Cake Boss,\" but I'm a fan of Buddy V's Ristorante. Its setting: rustic and contemporary with a homey ambiance that's reflected in its decor. The tall windows open up the space, providing view of Las Vegas Boulevard below. All right, enough of the interior design, on to the food!  Appetizer - Caesar Salad with Polenta Croutons, Parmesan, and Eggless Garlic Dressing: During Restaurant Week, I ate my share of Caesar salads from one restaurant to the next, and this one was the best because of the polenta croutons that were crunchy and soft at the same time. I wish I could eat this salad every day.   Main Course - My Dad's Bucatini Carbonara with Pancetta, Cracked Black Pepper, and Egg: One word: Divine. Ok, maybe a few more descriptive terms like creamy, pleasing to the palate. I would lick the entire bowl if no one was looking.   Dessert - Cannoli: Good, but not the best that I've had. It definitely packs a crunch and isn't too sweet as is, but there's always the option to sweeten it up further by dipping it into the chocolate sauce that it's paired with.   Not on the Restaurant Week Menu.   Appetizer - Garlic Bread: Topped with melted fontina and mozzarella cheeses. Makes a good, tasty starter.   Dessert - Lobster Tail: Filled with buttercream and garnished with fresh berries. Pretty yum, though difficult to cut into.   Service - Staff members were always aware of our table, never missing a beat.  Overall - This has quickly become a new Strip favorite of mine, and I'm already looking forward to my next meal here.",

They played right up until we got our main course so it was perfect timing. We split the caesar salad 3 ways and it was enough since we had the hot delicious focaccia bread with it. This is the best caesar salad I've ever had because of the warm polenta bites instead of croutons! Who knew a caesar salad could be exciting to eat?? I got the chicken rigatoni alla vodka sauce...OMG! sooo much flavor. I was full but kept eating it because it was soo good! Definitely have to come back to try the other dishes. One of the girls got the scallops which looked beautiful but wasn't too filling. The other one got the carbonara which she loved. The ambiance was perfect. Didnt have a long wait. Definitely a 5 star experience!",

    "text": "Finally made it to my 200th review!!  I decided to use this special spot for a review on one of the best plates of spaghetti I've ever had, EVER! Hubby and I had been excited to visit Buddy V's since the construction announcement. We are big fans of Buddy's so we were curious to see what his restaurant would have to offer.   This restaurant is located in the Grand Canal Shops. I'll give you a shortcut - if you enter from the side Walgreens is on, just go upstairs and you'll see the signage. Go in through the glass doors for the shops area and you're there. No need to go through the entire casino. His bakery is right across the hall.   Hubby and I decided beforehand that we were going to split the Chicken Parmesan and split a Lobster Tail for dessert. We got a great seat over by the window in the main dining area. The entire restaurant is decorated really cute, and I loved the family photos. Service was attentive but only by our waiter's helper - our waiter took our order then went missing until time for the check. The assistant was great, he deserved all of the tip but I doubt it ended up that way.   Chicken Parmesan was huge, definitely big enough to share. We each got a chicken breast and a large portion of spaghetti so I'm glad we split it. The spaghetti sauce was amazing, I'm still dreaming about it. Noodles were cooked perfectly. Chicken was cooked nicely, no complaints about the meal at all. Our Lobster Tail was a little hard though, like it was either over cooked or a few days old. Not flakey in a good way, more like shards of hard bread. And the pastry cream tasted like whipped cream, not what I was expecting for the price. We'll definitely be back but only for the Chicken Parm. Might try a different dessert next time.",

I hate paying for a drink of mostly juice. My mom and I had a couple of them and took off to do some shopping.   I'd love to return to eat the brunch buffet because it looked delicious.",

We went in on a Sunday around 5pm with no wait.  We ordered from the prix fixe menu which I believe was $39 for three courses, and we also order the highly recommended lasagna. We ordered meatballs and Caesar salad our starters, chicken parm for our main and ended with Lisa's Nutella cake for dessert. We were also given complementary bread.  In one word, go! Everything was unbelievably amazing. Even the croutons on the salad, which are made to order with a crunchy exterior and warm, soft interior. I always seem to go to Italian restaurants for my birthday, and this is by far the best that I've been to. It's a little pricey, but so worth it.",

We also got calamari for an appetizer and as a connoisseur of calamari I can tell u that Buddy Vs is top notch they have a very good sauce they serve it with. Now the best part. The bread. Their bread might be the best bread I've ever had at an Italian restaurant. My issue was that they didn't give enough.",

    "text": "I had a surprisingly solid lunch here the other day. First of all, the view is a big selling point., overlooking the strip. They have lunch specials and they are relatively reasonable in price for a restaurant on the strip.   I ordered the Italian hero with Caesar salad and my friend ordered the meatball appetizer. The sandwich was really good. Perfectly cooked bread, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The meat was flavorful and had a nice kick. The tomato tapenade added a nice spiciness as well. I tried some of my friend's meatballs and they were great. Moist and well-seasoned. Some of the better meatballs I've tried in town.    We couldn't stop by without trying some dessert, so we gave in and ordered a tiramisu as well as a Nutella cake with salted caramel gelato. The tiramisu was enormous, large enough for four people to share. The Nutella cake was not overly chocolatey and wonderfully paired with the caramel gelato. I'm not typically a fan of Nutella or cake but this was the perfect combination.   They are opening a Carlo's Bakery across from Buddy V's, which will be a great addition to accompany this restaurant.",

While I had my moment watching Buddy master cakes on the Cake Boss, to attach his name to a restaurant wasn't as exciting as say, having a bakery with his name on it.  I will say the meal started strong with the meatball appetizer. You get large meatballs in sauce and both were very good. So it set the standard high.  One of my favorite items at Italian restaurants is the pasta vodka. While it was good, it wasn't great by any means. Just okay. I did appreciate the al dente noodles though.   But the most surprising thing was the desserts. I get it, you want to include some family favorites like cannoli's, but still. No cake? What about featuring mini cakes that are decorated? Just something to play off the show. I just expected more than just three plain jane choices of sweets.   I'll admit I sought it out, having the name attached and being new, but I wouldn't urge anyone else to visit this spot while in Vegas.",

I ordered Madeline's whole wheat penne, and their pesto is one of the best I have ever had, but I do think they are a bit over-priced (not by much). In general, I will rate their food 5 star, price 3 star, and service 3 star.",

This is Buddy Valastro's (celebrity chef from Cake Boss) restaurant, so I figured it has to be good and it did live up to my expectations.  I ordered the Chicken parmesan and spaghetti. It's oven-baked, provolone, and mozzarella.  It was crispy and with the perfect amount of cheese.  The spaghetti was with marinara sauce-$22               My wife ordered Lasagna Al Forno, which apparently is what they're known for.  The lasagna contains italian sausage, beef, pork ricotta and baked cheese on top. My wife was a fan.  It was $22.  The portion was big enough to share, which we should have done, since we had food coma shortly after. The customer service was great and our server was attentive.  I just think the food is pricey for Italian food and it didn't even contain any seafood, but then again anytime you have a celebrity chef attached to the restaurant's name then expect to pay more, so excuse my rant.",

Again the service (Danny) was stellar, the food was delicious and again, I ate too much and had no room for dessert. Gonna miss this place!   Staying at the Palazzo we saw a show about the owner, his love for desserts. We checked it and thankful that we did. The restaurants pretty spacious but not a whole lot of tables yet we were able to get a reservation for two. Service was top-notch full bar there's enough there to please everybody. We ate so much from bread, salad to entree that it's a shame we didn't save room for desserts. What were we thinking! I feel like we got robbed by our own decision to eat it all because it was so good.   Guess it means we have to go back! Great wine selection too!",

The drinks were a bit slow but that's probs a good thing because it slowed down my dranking pace. There were  two servers helping us, one for each table and they asked that we all order at the same time. We all got our foods which was delicious. I felt that the serving sizes for the prices were a bit off. $12 for a side salad seemed a bit high, even for Vegas. The server at my table did a good job upselling a bunch of items, like shrimp with the scallops and scallops with the steak but she did not mention that there would be a price increase or the amount. Which is fine, we were hungry but a courtesy would have been nice.  They also brought out a birthday cake for the group in honor of the new couple. That was a very nice touch.  Overall this place was pretty good Italian. It is also across from Buddy's Baker which was genius. I got dessert at the restaurant and also at the baker across the street. I regret nothing.",

The staff was great and very attentive, the prices were reasonable $24 for spaghetti plus extra for meatballs, $13 for eggplant appetizer. Still two of us split and we were full!!",

Cooked medium like I requested and it was juicy with some nice greasiness. I appreciated the grilled brioche bun and the nice melty cheese. Their tomato aioli (cough mayo) added very little. The burger could prolly use a stronger compliment to the meat and cheese. The Parmesan dusted fries paired well with the burger. Overall I was pretty happy with it. Also happy with as many restaurants using creekstone farms as possible.",

With the caliber and recognition of the name behind the establishment, I expected better quality food. We missed the brunch and that sounded great. I'm not opposed to giving it a second try, but for my first experience ...it was just \"ok\". The service was great and drinks were good as well.",

Pros: easy to get reservation, seated on time, courteous staff, good menu selections. Cons: very loud environment, tables so close together you can hear the conversations of everyone next to you, found our waiter to be on the pushy side, food looked better than it tasted. Don't get me wrong, this is a good dinner option, just not a favorite for me. Environment had some to do with it, average tasting food was the rest.",

This place was one I will absolutely continue to return to each Vegas visit. Food was excellent, portions were big and definitely you get your money's worth. I had linguine and clams, we were a party of 9 and we ordered a variety of food such chicken parm which was very good, lasagna, spaghetti with sausage,shrimp scampi. They have a family style dinner option which seems like it would be a lot of food and good variety. Definitely on the list of great places to eat in Vegas !",

My wife see that they sell things with the restaurant's name on it.   She thought it would be a great idea to have the people there with her to sign an apron as a remembrance gift.   I asked the hostess station if they had a marker to use.  Unfortunately, they don't use them at the station.  I found the manager and decided that if I could get the staff to sign it would be over the top.    Boy, did that manager come through.    He had our server Kala ( sorry if I misspelled it) get the signatures.   He had everybody that was responsible for our meal sign the apron.    There were about a dozen on it.   He presented it to her at the end of our meal.    I can't thank them enough for making that dinner a very special one.   I look forward to my next visit here to Las Vegas.  I'm definitely coming here to eat again!!!",

My fav dish is the Spaghetti & Meatballs. I always pair it up with their Sangria.   Love their customer service. Love seeing the cooks in an open area preparing the meals because I'm nosy like that. Love that their bakery is across the way. I never leave room for dessert but that doesn't stop me from getting mine to go.   Friendly atmosphere. Good for a romantic dinner for two or a nice night out with friends.   This is a gamble worth taking, eating here always makes me feel like a winner!",

Better than many of the overpriced restaurants in strip casinos. Loved the fried calamari appetizer and fresh meatballs as well as mixed green salad with mozzarella. Warm rosemary bread was served with olive oil and balsamic. There was live music \"Sinatra songs\" and the atmosphere was very Italian. The lighting was very dark and it was a challenge to read the menu. we enjoyed a bottle of Prosecco with our meal that was refreshing. Reasonably priced menu.

SERVICE!!!!!! Our waiter Giorgio was probably the most incredible waiter I have EVER encountered in all my 40 years of dining 3 to 5 times a week. Astounding and personable, funny stories were shared between him and all my clients and he single handedly made the night... one of my potential clients enjoyed the evening so much he whispered on the way out that anybody that has great taste in dining establishments like Buddy Vs is someone he can see himself in business with..

We asked to sit at a booth by the window but was informed that was for guests with a party of 6 but she did seat us at another booth that was smaller. Ok no big.  Our waiter was excellent and very prompt! His name was Chaz according to the ticket. Great service, very knowledgeable about the menu and had great recommendations. He also never let our drinks get very low because he was bringing out a fresh one which I feel is hard for other servers to do anymore. I opted for the Margherita pizza while my mom got the Shrimp Scampi. While waiting they had fresh bread that just came out of the oven and was delicious.  Our food was great and looked good too :) they also start live music at 530 so that was a nice touch. After we were stuffed from dinner we had to look at the dessert menu because let's face it it's Buddys! The dessert menu had pictures of Buddy and his family which was a wonderful touch! We ordered Lisa's nutella cake and holy crap it was heavenly! I highly recommend it.  All in all we had a great experience and would definitely be back!",

Arrived a bit early for our reservation and were greeted by two extremely friendly and gracious hostesses who said they were happy to seat us early!! The restaurant is beautifully decorated and very clean, looks brand new inside although it's a couple years old! We were seated in a lively bustling dining area. And a young man immediately, upon us sitting down, took our drink order and poured us water. Right after that Caleb (our waiter) arrived, wished us a happy anniversary and asked if we would like to move to a more private table with a special view..we agreed of course and within 2 minutes he had checked with the hostess stand and ushered us to the back of the restaurant where the bustling was at a minimum and sat us at a beautiful table looking out over the palazzo and the strip. Was already amazed at this point and we hadn't even ordered yet! Caleb then spent a few minutes chatting with us and made some recommendations, we ordered the recommended appetizer a crispy mozzarella bread in red sauce..OMG they brought it so fast and it was to die for...could have just eaten that for dinner. I had the 3 course special, chose Caesar salad(amazing), chicken parm(light and Delish..ate the whole thing) and the Nutella chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream(words can't describe how Devine) hubby ordered the bone in veal parm chop. He was in heaven!! Throughout the meal Caleb gave us just enough attention but was careful to give us space to enjoy our meal, the wait staff had our drinks filled any time they were half empty...never had to ask for a refill and even completely cleared and wiped down our table before bringing desert. I've dined at many 4 and 5 star establishments who could take a lesson in customer service and good food quality from Buddy V's. Thank you Caleb and the staff for a meal and experience 2nd to none, and for making our Anniversary dinner one we will never forget!",

My mom and daughter and I were all under the weather with a stomach bug and was disappointed that we couldn't get the upmost experience but we ordered the shrimp scampi, served with pasta. The shrimp was huge fresh and delicious. My daughter and I split the Filet served with mash potatoes...fabulous in both flavor and presentation and they divided it for us at no extra charge. We were so upset that we were not feeling well enough to experience anything on the dessert menu. I hope we can get back soon. I only have two complaints: the music was really loud so it was really hard to have a conversation and there were two, I assume, managers, one man in a suit and the other a lady, who cased the joint like they were one of the Sapranos...I understand they are paid to keep the place running smooth but I felt like if you had checked his pockets, you would find a pair of brass nuckles or something worse #RoadtripUSA",

Waited for ever for a waitress. It was our anniversary even said happy anniversary but didn't even offer a free cannoli. We didn't even want it but she didn't even offer. Her and the water bus boy were too busy cavorting.  The FOOD was just so so. I would never return",

Caesar salad had a nice surprise-and-delight element of warm polenta croutons.  Yum.  Grandma's meatballs...excellent.  I am a tough critic of restaurant meatballs and those balls delivered!  Beef, pork and veal is always the right combination of flavor.  Red sauce great.  And the chicken with rigatoni in vodka sauce with pancetta...delish.  Rich, big flavor.  Huge portions.  The hubs and I split everything so don't be shy about sharing!  Great experience.",

Went to Carlos to get a couple pastries and decided to poke in and see what this place has to offer.  Went for an early dinner with my wife and was seated by the window in the back next to what im guessing is a party room. View was amazing, service mediocre, food a little high priced (the strip) but overall not bad at all. I had the osso buco my wife had the carbonara and we started with a panzanella salad. Server was pretty absent for the most part, but the view made for good conversation and weren't in any hurry. Overall i wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if i found myself stuck in the Venetian i might wonder back over.",

    "text": "I will let you know up front I usually do not like celebrity restaurants because they are overhyped and don't seem to deliver value for the price.  There are a few exceptions to this rule and Buddy V's is one of them for the following reasons.  1) As celebrity restaurants go, Buddy V's doesn't try to be trendy, rather it sticks to rustic italian fare and is very successful at it. 2) Pricing is actually more on the reasonable side than ultra expensive.  For $38.00 you can get a fixed price meal of an appetizer, entree and desert.  I had the Grandma's meatballs which were incredible, light fluffy balls of flavor in a red sauce; a pasta dish consisting of Bucatini, a thin tube spaghetti with pancetta black pepper and egg(this was my favorite dish of the night and is worth going back for more), and closed the night with nutella cake which was delicious.  Everyone at the table enjoyed their meals. 3) The service is fantastic. The waiter was very knowledgeable, guiding us with knowledge of all the dishes on the menu and providing prompt drink service and bread service.   All in all a great experience for the simple Italian cooking.",

    "text": "A friend who also travels often to Las Vegas asked me to do one thing on this visit...and that was visit Buddy V's and just sit at the bar for minimum one drink.  Everything she said about the bar was accurate: Comfortable, great view of The Strip and really friendly employees.  Honestly, it was not easy to find this place and I know my way around The Venetian as a longtime fan of Grand Lux Cafe and that casino floor where I once played blackjack with 90210 hottie Lindsay Price.  My bartender at Buddy V's was a tremendously nice guy named Mike and he poured me a strong vodka cocktail.  The entire place just smelled too good to not at least look at the menu while sipping so Mike steered me right in a modest order of Grandma's Meatballs with some delicious bread that was exactly the right amount of food.  This simply was not your typical Vegas bar or restaurant experience...and that's why I will be back on my next visit.  Oh, and the place has some nice windows that overlook The Strip and a few tables are right against these windows if you want to just eat, drink and take it all in.  Buddy V's wasn't too loud, wasn't too snobby, wasn't too busy and wasn't too expensive either.  Maybe the fact that it is not easy to find is a good thing for those of us who already know about it.",

    "text": "So let me just start by saying the food here is amazing.  The drinks are meh, but the pasta was DELISH!  The reason why my review is so low is because our server sucked.  I'm not some snooty restaurant goer either.  I used to work in a restaurant, so I know how it's not hard to be an okay server.  However, that being said, we were there for a Bachelorette dinner, and we had maybe 2 small interactions with our waiter.  He was extremely show, didn't check on us once, but decided to charge us extra for some souvenir cups we didn't ask for and failed to inform us that a smaller bottle of water was $10 each.  We waited for 30 min after we were done eating for him to come by to us and check if we wanted anything else or our bill.  Horrible service and really disapointed about this restaurant as I'm a huge Cake Boss and Buddy fan.  If the service improves by a lot, then I'll be back, but until then, I'd rather be checking out other restaurants on the strip.",

She was very pleasant and helpful.   Our assistant server / busser was Carlos. Wow - this guy had it going on. So pleasant, so prompt - really nice guy too.   Carlos brought our water super promptly.  Our Valerie followed shortly thereafter to take our order.   After we ordered, Carlos was back with oil and vinegar and really yummy focaccia bread.   Grilled Octopus Wow - this was really good. Grilled flavor and very tender. Not at all like calamari. Served with grilled onions and peppers.   Dinner Salad A decent salad of arugula and other mixed greens with small tomato halves and pieces of cucumber with croutons in a light dressing.   Sunday Gravy  Wow - this was great!  First, a maybe, 4 to 6 ounce portion of Rigatoni, then a cast iron skillet of Meat in a rich red gravy. The meat was Meatballs, Sausage, Lamb and Pork.   We liked the first 3 equally and the pork the least.   If you have a salad, an appetizer or both, the Sunday Gravy dish easily feeds two people. A lot of meat!    Dessert We ordered 2 coffees and the Italian Birthday Cake to share.  The cake - OMG the cake!  Not exaggeration here - one of the best cakes I've ever eaten!  We sat just outside the restaurant, sort of in the mall hallway. A bit noisy but good people watching. And this is Valerie and Carlos's station and they really killed it tonight.   Thanks Buddy V's - we really made a great call to eat here tonight and look forward to the next time!",

    "text": "Good food, good wine, good service   We had been in Vegas a few hours and were ready for dinner, in the mood for Italian and staying in the Palazzo so decided to try Buddy V's. Seated on the \"patio\" (inside the hotel, but outside the restaurant), there were 3 of us. They had asked if we had reservations when we arrived (no) and we were still seated right away.   Atmosphere: we enjoyed the \"patio\" area. We were looking for a place to sit, drink, eat and relax after traveling from the east coast and this was perfect. Waitress was very nice and made recommendations, answered questions and was patient. She continued to check on us through the meal, though she asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu before we had received our dinner. Later she apologized and that's when I realized she had forgotten we hadn't received our entrees yet. SMH. Hubby and Bestie had a bottle of wine suggested by the waitress. They enjoyed it but it was a bit on the expensive side. The waitress kept their glasses full until the bottle was done. She also kept my water glass full.  They also serve this delicious rosemary focaccia. Light and just the slightest hint of rosemary.   Food: Delicious! Portions were very good. We were full but not outrageously.   Appetizers Eggplant Parm: it's a round stack of crispy eggplant, layered with cheese and tomato sauce. It was DELICIOUS!! Two of us shared and it really could've been shared by 4 people as an app.   Meatballs: 6 smallish meatballs in a dish with red sauce. Very light, not too much filler. Hubby and Bestie really enjoyed these.   Main Courses: Chicken Parm - hubbys stand by and it didn't disappoint. Two large pieces of chicken Parm served with spaghetti. Hubby ate all of the chicken and at least half the pasta. He doesn't normally eat too much pasta. He really enjoyed it.   Linguine with Clam Sauce: Bestie ventures out to try something new. It was plated nicely with the clams and smelled good. Bestie ate almost all of it!   Orchiette with Italian Sausage. This also had broccoli rabe and a fresh tomato sauce. When I say fresh, I mean fresh tomatoes sauteed or roasted, but not too long. With garlic oil? The sausage was SO GOOD! I don't normally love sausage but wanted something \"lighter\" and figured if the sausage was good it could be amazing. I ate EVERY CRUMBLE OF SAUSAGE. I dug through what I wasn't eating to get it all!! I truly enjoyed this meal.   None of us had room for dessert. There want a lot to choose from, which I assume is because Buddy's bakery is right across from the restaurant. It was constantly busy when we went by.   I am guessing in the busier months you might want a reservation. Or if you go to dinner later (we went around 430 bc we were on east coast time). I couldn't figure out the dress code. I don't know if that's why we were on the patio or not.",

    "text": "Come here for great, home-cooked style Italian food with classic flavors in an upscale setting at the Venetian! We walked in and were seated promptly at around 8:30 on a Saturday night. Cozy ambience and very prompt service. Wait staff quite attentive and refilled bread and water without being asked. Prices were average to good for a semi-fancy place along the strip, especially for the quality of the food.  Garlic bread - warm, tender and well-seasoned if lacking a bit of salt. Perfect dipped in olive oil and balsamic.  Calamari - standard taste, crisp and fresh. Low quantity but more than enough for us. Battered onion and pepper slices a nice touch!  Buddy's favorite pizza - excellent, flavorful and filling. Olive oil flavor punches through and accentuates the richness of the cheeses. Great value for price!  Cheese pizza - loaded, fresh and baked perfectly.  My Dad's Bucatini carbonara - delicious, decent portion size, al dente. Pancetta flavor excellent. Very eggy sauce without being overpowering. Suggest getting a bit of pepper on it.  Fettuccine Alfredo - my son said it was excellent.  Nonna's Lasagna il Forno - HUGE portion, 11 year old son was only able to eat 1/3 of it. Classic flavors, perfectly put together.   Caesar Salad - Classic taste, fresh. Croutons were one of a kind and delicious!  Check this place out! We chose Buddy V's over Trevi and Carmine's based on reviews.",

The down side was you had to exit the restaurant to use the casino bathrooms which had long lines every time!  Over all it was a good experience. The restaurant is a little tricky to find if you have never been to the Canal Shoppes - half of our party was late due to getting lost.

I love how everything from the photos on the walls, to the menus, to the recipes were all Buddy's family.  We both had sangria's (my favorite/go to) and they were pretty good. Not the best sangria I've ever had, but good. We started out with the calamari...yummy. I definitely recommend it as a starter. There's a good amount and it's very good.  Our entree's were well portioned and overall great. They had a great menu of so many Italian classics, it was hard to choose! We finished our dinner with two cannoli's (another favorite). I absolutely love the cannoli's here. They do it right, which is hard to find in Vegas!  Overall, this place is a little pricey but a great choice for classic Italian food made the right way.",

The location is a bit weird -- it's in the Venetian but around a weird entrance in the shopping area that's not super accessible from the Uber/Lyft drop-off. But once you find it, Buddy V's screams classic Italian with red and white checkered tablecloths and a wine list longer than I could read (or afford). The food was all great with pretty big portions, and the carb-loading was exactly what we needed before a night out! They have gluten free pasta, and the fettuccine alfredo was every bit as creamy and delicious as I'd hoped it'd be.  I came with a group of seven, and the service was surprisingly fast and efficient. Our waiter was a little weird, albeit friendly, but nonetheless, I wouldn't hesitate to return next time I'm in Las Vegas and looking for some classic Italian food!",

I figured the authenticity being from Italy and such. I would rate this on the level of a Buco DePippo's food chain. The Caesar salad was average, which could be found at an Olive Garden . The octopus was, grilled, so-so. I had the Seabass which look like a trout. My two employees both had the chicken which look like it was smothered in gravy. We shared a Bolognese pasta which was probably the best because the chef made it perfect very very al dente. The waitress and staff where friendly and professional .   Over all my expectation was a little more authentic and quiet . The live music was nice but it was very loud. Where you could not have a conversation without raising your voice a few octaves.",

I'd researched before our visit and looked over the menu and noticed they had a Prix Fixe lunch menu. When er were seated this wasnt offered to us so I had to ask.   I got the chicken parmesan that came with a caesar salad, generous portion of pasta and chicken, and I got tiramisu for dessert. My boyfriend ordered a margherita pizza.  I really enjoyed my meal. The pasta was delicious and I loved the focaccia bread with oil for dipping. The only thing I didn't enjoy were the croutons on the caesar. They were warm and reminded me of cornbread. Service was a little slow but we quickly learned that is the Vegas norm.",

When you indulge in the bottomless drink menu, it is truly that, you will not see the bottom of your glass with mimosas, wine, a pomegranate Bellini that will pucker you in the right spots, bloody Mary's and of course domestic beer. For $16.95 we enjoyed a multitude of beverages while being serenaded by the live band. The food overly met the expectations we had entering the establishment with a mix between a carving station, pasta station, fresh fruit, deserts and many more. Between the service of TJ and assistance by Shelby we had only ask and it was available. Definitely will return to Buddy V's on a return trip!!!  The Strip DEFINITELY got a little sweeter!!",

Buddy V's is located in the Venetian on the furthest end (passing all the clothing shops). I was dressed  up and hoping the rain wouldn't get us! Ladies, if you suck at wearing heels like me, make sure you keep them in the hotel. This was a long walk for the Uber drop off.  After torturing myself with my cute heels, we finally made it! The restaurant is beautiful. Dim lighting, adorned with cute white and red table cloths and wooden tables. The menu had so much to choose from! I went with the Three Cheese Ravioli. It was honestly one of the best ravioli I've had thus far! The cheese was so creamy, the sauce was cooked with the most amazing herbs, it all tasted fresh! I paired it with a  Melon Blossom, it was a mix of melon and citrus. With Grey Goose Melon, elderflower, orange-cello and cucumber, the drink was super fruity yet floral! It tasted like liquid melon! So so good.   I also tried their Spaghetti Central-Pomodoro. Apparently the sauce on this dish is cooked differently with different time intervals between cooking, and let me tell you the flavor is so amazing! The sauce was nothing like my ravioli, it tasted more sweet and acidic...amazing! And because it was my birthday and it is Buddy's I had to try their Cannoli!   I definitely recommend this place. It was a beautiful restaurant with amazing food, great service and great Italian dishes to select from!",

We all had the $40 dinner which comes an appetizer, entree and dessert.  I highly recommend the carbonara!!! Pretty sure it's the BEST I've ever had. Grandma's meatballs are also quite delicious. So much food!!! Come hungry. Excellent adult beverages also. We will absolutely be back. One of the best restaurants in Vegas.",

The rest of the salad was a flavorless bland combo of bread, cherry tomatoes, rotten romas and rotten cucumbers. It was disgusting. I tried to pick around the rotten produce and just eat the cherry tomatoes accidentally getting a rotten one in my mouth before spitting it out , not wanting to cause a scene... the waiter never came by for me to even tell them it was a health hazard!    Also, I didn't even have bread to eat because they give you these tacky bread sticks in a plastic bag. Overall the worst experience at a restaurant I have ever had in Las Vegas, which is rare because there are a lot of amazing restaurants on the strip. I have never been served rotten food before. My husband's dish was bland small, flavorless and overpriced.   Don't waste your money because Buddy is on TV (Cake Boss), his bakery is great, but his restaurant is terrible.",

She made a reservation for a Sunday night lucky as they were really busy. We were seated within 5 mins of arrival at a table beside the kitchen, within 2 mins our waiter came over to offer us a quieter table in the corner near the window and had our drinks within 5 mins. I ordered caesars salad for appetiser my wife had Grandmas meatballs, both meals were amazing you could see the herbs in the meatballs and the flavour was incredible, my Caesars salad was fresh and croutons were not to crunchy but fresh. We ordered off a theatre special menu which was $38 each for a 3 course meal which we thought was pretty cheap ( being from Australia its hard to find an entree for around that price so this was cheap for us). My Entree was chicken parma and my wife had Buddy SNR Bucatini carbonara, dessert was Nutella cake and a cannoli which we took desserts back to hotel room as we were full from our mains. All in all this restaurant was AMAZEBALLS  we will be returning again in the future and to top it off we went to Carlos bakery  right across from the restaurant.  Beware alcohol is pricey....  BONUS our waiter looked like THE ROCK!!!!!",

    "text": "O M G. If you are looking for homemade, delicious, traditional, NY Italian food- this is where you need to be. The food in this place tasted like home in Brooklyn in my mother in laws kitchen. The restaurant is in a wing of the Venetian and across the way from it, is Carlo's Bakery. (You can easily access the restaurant from outside the Venetain. Its above the Walgreens close to the Deuce stop. Almost like you are leaving the Ventian and walking towards Palazzo). The restaurant was very pretty with gorgeous views. The vibe is very causual, laid back, like you stopped by a friends house. Any clothing goes. No dress code. Not at all stuffy and pretentious like Giadas. (see review). We had a friend with us from Texas who had never had NY Italian food, so we had to take her there and see if it was authentic. Authentic it was. We started out with the mozzerella and Carozz that was amazing. I got the \"Sunday Gravy\"- which is exactly how we make it here. You get a bowl of pasta, with a seperate skillet of red meat sauce with meatballs (OMG delish), pork shoulder, lamb. My husband had pasta bolongese. Insanely good. My Texas friend had the lasagne. It was huge and she ate it for 3 days. All portions were big. The food was not pricey. The dessert menu comes in what looks like an old photo album, and it contains pics of a young Buddy and family with his dad, and then pics of him with his own kids. The whole place is decorated in family pictiures in frames on the walls. For dessert, we had the Nutella (yes Nutella) Lava cake!! OMG. Melted Nutella runs out of the center of this lava cake served with Salted Caramel ice cream. There are no words. Get yourself there  ASAP. You will not be sorry. It was so good, we went twice during out 10 day stay. Had to go back for lunch and got more meatballs, eggplant parm and 2 amazing salads. My new fav place in Vegas. Buddy needs to franchise these places out across the country. I hear Buddy is there monthly. Sadly he was there as soon as we got home to Nyc. Cant wait to go back.",

I was a bit concerned with the screw top. We had the wine with dinner and enjoyed a great meal. We met some nice peeps next to us and had some great conversation and a most enjoyable evening. Thank you Mike and Buddy V\"s for a most enjoyable time and meal. We'll be back. Highly recommend for great tasting authentic style Italian food, with a classy twist.",

    "text": "I was hoping that this restaurant was gonna be good... Big fail;( well we went for sunset menu ( 3-5pm) . We started off with the Buddy's Salumi n cheese board($19) as an appetizer...nothing special for the price. Then waiter asked if we wanted garlic bread (FYI not free it was $9 for 3 pieces) bread wasn't even warm, great Italian bread is a precursor to a great meal, not even close.  Menu was limited which isn't bad bc that usually means that the stuff on the menu is usually great...Uhm not the case. The linguine n clams ($25) portion small & there was spaghetti noodles instead of linguine??? Caprese salad($14) there was a whole tomato on the plate which was like boiled n peeled, unimpressed. The angus burger had no flavor n the French fries were overdone n cold, really???  Ok so after being disappointed by the food I was really looking forward to dessert... The XL lobster tail ($15) was so disappointing bc the pastry shell was hard as a rock n hard to eat. As you bite into it all the cream would shoot out bc the shell was so hard. The cannoli shell was hard as well, like a hard cookie ($9). If you had real cannolis you know that they are not supposed to taste like that. To top it off the coffee yes the coffee tasted horrible, like it's been sitting in the pot all day. For 3 people and sunset menu which is cheaper than dinner total $153 and that's with no alcohol..for that total there was not one thing I could say anything nice about. I had leftovers that weren't even worth taking home.  Yes, I should of known better to go to a gimmicky restaurant. But I liked the show and I'm from NYC and was hoping for some good Italiano food n dessert. No love in the food at all. Don't waste your money n time going all the way to the crazy strip for this place.  Buddy .....if your reading this or your PR person lets you know what's going on with your restaurant. This place is giving your familia a bad name. I've had your pastries in NJ. This place is not giving your bakery any justice. People who travel to Las Vegas and who will never go to your bakery in NJ are going to think that your desserts taste like this ( specifically in the restaurant) not good.",

He was pleasant, funny, and totally on his game as far as drink orders (ask him to make you something - he's got a few awesome drinks up his sleeve!). He definitely steered me in the right direction for dinner - the cheese raviolis are out of this world! We also had a few appetizers that ended up being a meal - grandmas meatballs were heaven, the mozzarella cheese appetizer was not like anything I've had before (in all the right ways), and the antipasti plate was this awesome combo of cheeses and meats and olives that I was swooning over. The only bad part? No room for dessert! Guess I'll just have to go back next time I'm in town!!",

    "text": "First thing first - Standout dishes:  - Buddy's Caprese: I am normally not a fan of Caprese salads, but Buddy really nails this one. High quality ingredients, and finely tuned flavors make this a worthwhile starter.  - Cheese Ravioli: I know what you're thinking. \"I can get cheese ravioli anywhere.\" Yes, you can. The great thing about the ravioli at Buddy V's, however, is that it is a perfect companion to Buddy's outstanding roasted tomato sauce. It's bright, tangy, smooth, and well rounded all at the same time. Definitely memorable fare.  - Cannoli: I am normally not what you would call a \"fan\" of cannoli, but, once again, Buddy has proved me wrong. Most cannoli, in my experience, are disappointing in their grainy, and under-sweetened filling. Not so with these cannoli. Perfectly sweetened, incredibly smooth filling paired with just the right amount of cinnamon in the pastry make these cannoli worth writing home about. (Added perk: After eating at Buddy V's, you can walk right across the hall, and buy a whole box of cannoli from Carlo's Bakery to eat back at the hotel if you are so inclined.)  Now, to business. There is definitely no shortage of Italian food on the Las Vegas Strip, but Buddy V's is definitely a major standout. Even among all of the other celebrity chef restaurants to be found in Vegas, the Cake Boss is definitely holding his own.  My wife and I stopped by for lunch one afternoon, and had a great time. Our experience was so good, though, that we went back for dinner two days later. For lunch we just stopped by, but for dinner we made reservations through OpenTable. Neither time was the place so busy one would need reservations in order to avoid a wait, however.  Here are some highlights of Buddy V's worth noting:  - The service at Buddy V's is excellent. They are easily on par with restaurants with much higher price points.  - Having worked in food service, I am hyper-sensitive about cleanliness. I had absolutely no complaints here, however. The entire restaurant is very clean, comfortable, and inviting.  - The pricing of most menu items is very reasonable in comparison with many similar Vegas eateries.  - The whiskey/scotch selection at Buddy V's bar is truly impressive. It's not hard to find a bar that serves Johnnie Walker Black anywhere, but one that serves Johnnie Walker Green, Gold, and Blue is tough to find at any price point.  - Unlike most restaurants in the Venetian, Buddy V's is right near an entrance making it an easy place to duck in for a meal without having to stray too far from the strip.  Final pro tip: Be sure to note on your reservation that you are celebrating a birthday, if that is the case. They have some fun, no-loud-obnoxious-singing-involved surprises for birthday-folk. I would imagine the same is True for most other celebrations as well.",

    "text": "Overall the food was good, the service was friendly, but a bit bumpy and the wine was disappointing.   For appetizers, we shared the mac & cheese, salumi and mozzarella en carozza.  These were all solid dishes, with the mozzarella probably being my favorite.  Our entrees were brought out before we were even half way through the appetizers, but when I said something they took them away.  I was a little worried that our meals would be sitting under a heat lamp, but kudos to the staff for bringing us fresh dishes when the time came. I thought the wine list was rather lame.  I like wine, but am not an expert, so when I recognize a bunch of the wines as the variety I can find at my local Smith's, I am a bit let down.  I finally ordered a bottle of an Italian variety I liked, but when it came time for the sample taste I was almost tempted to refuse it.  It wasn't spoiled, but sure did taste as though it had been stored at the wrong temperature. For entrees, we tried the lasagne, Dad's Bucatini and spaghetti and meatballs.  Again, all the dishes were good.  I especially loved the Bucatini and would get it again.  Desserts were not quite as good as I expected.  The cannoli were fresh, but the filling was lighter than the ricotta I expected and overall had a strong cinnamon oil taste.  The Nutella cake was your standard lava cake that has been around since the 80s.  The coffee was nice and strong.",

The lower rating is due to the dessert menu. It is limited and not very good. We ordered the apple turnover, tiramisu, cannollis, ice cream, lemon blueberry cheesecake and the hazelnut chocolate cake. The ice cream is great, but not home made and the only other great dessert was the hazelnut chocolate cake. Everything else was very average. What a surprise!

    "text": "First off... Buddy V's food...  Always amazing!  Service usually amazing as well.  However, this review is for the waiter Kaleb.  Who wasn't even our waiter.  We made a reservation and were seated at one of the two chef's tables.  After giving us the details on the family style meal not on the menu our waiter filled our drinks.  Then we met Kaleb... Nope not our waiter.  He informed us we were being moved because they wanted to use our table for a 12 top.  There were six of us.  He didn't ask he told us we needed to get up and move and leave our drinks on the table.   We asked what was going on.  He just kept saying we had to move.  So as we were being basically pushed to another table at the back of the place he was being a jerk through the process.  Then he tried to switch us from the lunch menu to he dinner menu without explaining what the difference was.  Also telling us he would get a free desert for one of us.  Apparently the menu change is basically a higher price and more items.  Luckily he wasn't going to be our waiter at the new table.  As most should do we called the manager over.  He apologizes and asks us if we want a different table.   Which we didn't care about the table.  He was missing the point Kaleb was being a jerk.  He offered at least free desert to all of us.  We even confirmed it was all of us and not one of us.   Our waitress Kristy... Was amazing!!! So again take note this 1 star rating is not the norm... we generally would give it 5.  Kaleb should get a 0.  Even a few of the staff agreed and confirmed Kaleb was a jerk.  The manager was subpar.  When ordering the apparently free desert we were told it was for 4 of us.   Our waitress went and made sure it was adjusted to what was promised.  Again, We would request Kristy because her service was amazing and she dealt with the situation better than the manager.  When we left 2 hours in... The 12 top never showed up.  We were going to order the family dinner.  So they lost out on probably twice bill and still would have been able to seat the 12 top.  When we told the manager on the way out that that party never showed he said they had to save the reservation and we should be happy because he bought us over $100 worth of desert.  We reminded him that 6 people x $9 doesn't quite equal that.  He says ... \"Well I tried.\" We didn't care about the free desert.  It was how the restaurant handled it.  The point is how this situation was handled.  In our opinion ... It was terrible.",

If you love meatballs you gotta try them on your visit. Also the calamari is a great dish as an appetizer very good.   Chicken parm was a good dish too but if I go again I'm getting the lasagna..",

Their weekend brunches consist of a buffet option with plentiful options of the traditional Italian food options to normal breakfast options.  There is also a massive dessert table consisting of bread puddings to concoctions from Carlos bakery across the hall.  Our server was amazing and made sure our drinks were never more than half empty as we had all partaken in the all you can drink mimosa/sangria option.  He was even kind enough to get our last rounds in to go cups so we wouldn't have to wander the strip drinkless!",

The portions of big so I recommend sharing and entree. My wife and I did and we still didn't finish the food.   Overall I would it give it a 4.25",

This is the best chicken parm I've ever had.... chicken was so moist and juicy. It melted in my mouth and left me wanting to finish off this large potion. Thankfully, my husband ended up eating some of mine and saved me from devouring the caloric bomb. Everything we had was tasty and we will definitely be returning.

Doesn't matter where you go, there's always someone in shorts and a crappy t-shirt and flip-flops. Having said that, we still managed to have enjoy a nice romantic evening. The waiter was great. The chicken parm was great, the corozza was great, the lobster tails and Italian birthday cake were of course great. And just because I needed to try the tiramisu, we came back a few days later. And of course, that was great too. Nice touch with a little bit of chocolate cake in the bottom. I liked that the place wasn't overly crowded and we could go and sit down pretty much whenever. It was certainly one of the highpoints of our trip and I very much look forward to going back. And next time, I'll look forward to stopping into the Carlos Bakery shop opening up just next door. I know some complained about the pricing. I would argue that once again, that's just Vegas. Cocktails cost pretty much $14 wherever you go, unless you're sitting at the slots, and restaurant food is pretty much always $20+ for entrees. That's just the way it is.",

    "text": "Stopped in here with my family of five as we cruised through the Venetian for a late lunch. We were really headed to Carlos' Bakery but were hungry and went in to Buddy's.  Two kids got meatball sandwiches, one got the margherita pizza, and my wife and I split the salumi and cheese plate with a couple glasses of house red. Happily I got a few bites of the meatball sandwich and it was probably the best I've ever had. The salumi and cheese plate was a great split for a light meal, with excellent meats, cheeses, and I loved the olives. Not normally an olive fan. My daughter really liked the pizza, too.  The bill was about eighty five bucks and the service was good, not great.  Tip: If you want to hit the bakery, grab a number before or during your meal. There was a significant wait for the bakery, although perhaps the novelty will have worn off after a little time has passed.",

The service was cordial and quick and not pushy. Personally we tried garlic bread, cheese ravioli with a white sauce ,and a pasta al la vodka. The garlic bread had the perfect portions of additives making it a great addition to our meal. The ravioli with our requested white sauce tasted phenomenal. Great cheese blend with an accommodating white sauce that was buttery but not too heavy. The vodka sauce was a phenomenal mix and just the right portion of red to white. Customer service was great, we look forward to coming here again!",

We had the spaghetti bolognese and chicken parm.  Our waiter was beyond terrible though. It wasn't one specific thing, just a lot of little things that added up to a poor experience.  The bus boy/bread deliverer/water guy was great, and that's the only thing I can say positively about the place. At these prices, we definitely won't be back.",

    "text": "I came here the other day for their Sunday buffet brunch special.   My experience was very enjoyable, from the good food to the excellent service.  Since it was a buffet, I ended up trying a lot of the food they had to offer. Some of the food that stood out to being especially good was the Sunday eggs, the chicken parm, panetone French toast, the caesar salad, the chicken apple sausage, and meatballs. There was mac and cheese there as well. This was the first time I had mac and cheese at a buffet or all you can eat setting, and it tasted exceptional. The noodles weren't over cooked, and the cheese sauce was tasty and creamy, there was a bread crumb like topping on it that help bring it all together. There was even some partially peeled shrimp there. Unlike some places, it was properly cleaned and deveined, on top of it not being over cooked and mushy. I wish the cocktail sauce that accompanied it had some more flavor and horseradish in it. The, what I were to assume, mini cannoli were excellent, even though they were already filled, the shell was still crispy and crunchy while the filling wasn't overly sweet.  All of the food I tasted had flavor, and was appealing to the eye, which tends to be a lacking attribute for a lot of buffet places. While you saw the cooks actually make the food, it actually tasted and looked like it was made from scratch, not something that came from a bag, frozen, or reheated from the day before.  The service was top notch. My glass was never less that 1/3 empty, and the busser made sure I always had fresh forks and knives when I came back with more food. The waitress and busser were very attentive, always making sure I was comfortable, enjoying myself, and asking if there was anything they could do for me.  For the price, selection and quality of food, and service, I was very satisfied with my experience at Buddy V's Ristorante. Not only will I most definitely be coming back for the brunch special, I would recommend the place to other people that I know.",

We were seated in about 10 minutes during lunch hour (1240ish).  We were seated at a table overlooking the strip (great) in the bar area (no problem).  The problem was that our waitress was the bartender, and despite only having one or two people at the bar the whole time we were there, it took ages to get anything done, including ordering drinks, our meal, dessert, etc.  It took almost 2 hours to have an app, a split meal, and a dessert.  The hardest working person in there was the busier, who was busting his butt the entire time!  He deserves a raise. :)",

Calamari was big and the jalapenos in it gave it a nice flavor. My husband ordered the meatball sub. The meatballs were lacking a little flavor and I would have liked more cheese, but the sauce had good flavor and the roll it came on was soft. I ordered the chicken piccata. I really liked it. The chicken was pounded thin and the sauce was a little thick and it was the perfect mixture of lemon and capers. I LOVED the Italian birthday cake! It was vanilla cake with a chocolate filling and there was cannoli filling too. It was to die for. It was not overly sweet either and it's definitely big enough to share, but I wouldn't...;)",

My husband had the Panzanella Salad and Orecchiette Pasta. He said both were amazing. We also shared the Warm Nutella Cake. It was magical.

(3) service is good and prompt (3) value: it was okay for Restaurant week special but I would skip this place at regular prices.   We came in to try their restaurant week lunch menu which serves a 3 course lunch for $20.15.   I got her Caesar salad,  grilled salmon over a cucumber/chickpea/artichoke salad while the hubs got the tomato basil soup and spaghetti and meatballs.  Both came with a dessert course of cannoli and cookie selection.   The tomato basil soup was a little too bland and needed more basil. The texture was good.  I liked the Caesar salad better albeit it was a little heavy on the dressing and needed more acidity. The hubs thought there was a little too much anchovy in the dressing but I kind of like that. The polenta croutons were a great addition textural and flavorful.   Spaghetti and meatballs was really nothing special and the sauce was too bland -  there really wasn't enough tomato flavour to really make this dish stand out. The meatballs were under seasoned. The spaghetti itself was cooked a bit beyond al dente which in a dish like this,  makes it disappointing.   My salmon dish fared better. The grilled salmon was done perfectly. However the salad of cucumber,  arugula,  chickpea and artichokes was a bit underwhelming and needed more acidity/brightness to bring the flavors together.   The worst course was dessert. It each came with a cannoli and 3 cookies -  oatmeal, chocolate chip and sugar cookie. The cinnamon cannoli was okay albeit rich...there wasn't enough cinnamon in there to really distinguish itself. The cookies were really bad -  they did not have that rich buttery taste to them. The sugar cookie especially tasted more like shortening and artificial flavors. I think they also skimp out and use cheap artificial vanilla extract.  After we finished lunch I was watching the bakers at Carlos bakery. Guess what I saw? A half used package of pre-made manufactured Rice Krispies treats with the shiny blue foil packaging and Kelloggs branded elves (see the pic). Seriously. As a bakery,  you cannot make rice krispie treats yourselves? (Just FYI, all you need is a microwave,  marshmallows,  butter,  rice krispie cereal, a bowl,  a spatula and 10 minutes to make this dessert). To me,  that is just bad form.   At the end of the day, I give the dining experience a 3 star -  it's okay but nothing I would return for. As for Carlos bakery -  just the cookies and the aforementioned shortcut I saw are enough for me to stay far away.",

After being seated we were giving menu and drink menu. Everything sounded really good and look delicious! I order the madiline penne and my friends all ordered something different. The food came out fairly quick, but it seemed like our waiter kept on forgetting what we had. The service was okay, but it was as they were almost rude. The food was also okay it wasn't as expected. I've actually had better! So overall buddy v is just hype because of the TV show. At this point it was an experience and that it's really up to you if you'd like to try it out.

The pasta was perfect and the sauce complimented so nicely I could have had it without the meatballs. But who am I kidding, those meatballs just took it up a notch! Definitely freshly made, juicy with all the right spices. I was so full that I had one meatball left and yes..I took that fist sized meatball in a doggy bag! No shame here.   My kids enjoyed the oven baked Mac & Cheese gooey on the inside and crispy on the outside & the gourmet burger on freshly baked brioche bread with aioli and side of fries. Happy campers with full bellies!   Of course being so full we had to take our cannoli to go. It looked so darn good that to my surprise tasted even better than I imagined. We ordered the chocolate chip and pistachio nut toppings. The cannoli stayed crispy/flaky even after eating it hours later. The cream and chocolate sauce was sheer perfection.  Definite must!   A casual, hearty establishment for the entire family.  Bundt cake molds for wall decor as well as kitchen utensil inspired lighting and fixtures.  Booth seats overlook the Vegas strip. Since lunch was a hit, I would definitely come back here and check out their dinner menu.",

We were stuffed but took a cannoli and lobster claw to go-- more crazy deliciousness. Pomegranate martini a bit to syrupy, but no big deal since everything else was perfection. Great atmosphere too.",

We had a great server by the name of Peter who recommended family style dishes ( veal parm, chicken marsala, lasagna  & more that were just  amazing !  In addition , Peter and his team of helpers made sure everything was taken care and everyone was comfortable.  It was an amazing experience and I highly recommend Buddy's for your next special occasion . Ps- I ordered my daughters birthday cake from Carlo's Bakery across the hall from the restaurant and it was so delicious!",

We had a reservation and was seated immediately. *******  Pretty pricy for what you get. $35 each for brunch. $10 for bottled water at the table. Very little at the carving station. Chicken parm was out, but they did replenish it eventually. It was pretty good. I didn't see much else that I liked. Got some pizza from the kids section to try to fill up. Dessert was the highlight, but it didn't blow me away. Service was very good.",

    "text": "I came back for the croutons...wait, what? You read that right. Croutons. The little, dried-up bread scraps on salads. I ordered a Caesar salad to start with before my entree, completely unaware of the discovery I was about to make. When my salad arrived, I was immediately intrigued by the croutons - they were unlike any I had ever seen. These croutons were perfect, one-inch square cubes, caramelized to a perfect golden brown on the outside. Biting into one, I discovered a filling of warm polenta - also known as grits in some parts. It was apparent that these croutons had just come out of the oven, and they were HEAVENLY! I wished I could  have ordered a whole plate of them - they were that good. The rest of my experience at Buddy V's was outstanding - the main course, the service, the ambience were all great. It was those croutons, however, that brought me back for dinner the next two nights in a row.  UPDATE: I stopped in for lunch on a Thursday with the family. They had a three-course lunch special. I started off with a Caesar Salad with those heavenly polenta croutons...WOW. My main course was the Chicken Parm, which was delicious. An order of Tiramisu and a cup of coffee was the perfect finish. The service and atmosphere were impeccable. I may have discovered one of the world's best Italian restaurants. I will not miss an opportunity to return!",

All I have to say is that I was disturbed by my meatballs. I was flat out disappointed by my meatballs. Those were not good meatballs.   I had spaghetti and meatballs. My first cause for concern was that our dishes came out insanely fast. Never a good sign in my book. I'm not at Burger King, I do no expect my food to arrive in less than five minutes. The meatballs were small and when I split one with my fork, it did not crumble like a freshly made meatball should. It was hard. And I bet you anything it had been frozen at one point. Sauce was incredibly bland. I was incredibly disappointed.   Main cause for disappointment? This was not my first time here. I've had their meatballs before. They were heavenly, delicious, tasty and FRESH!   Saving grace was their Italian Cake. That was pretty good. But as for the meal, all I can say is how corporate of them.",

I could see that there were open tables, so I'm not 100% sure this was True. My friend mentioned that he was an employee at the Venetian, so the hostess said she could seat us in about 10 minutes. They put us at a table in the back corner of the restaurant with empty tables all around. I wasn't a fan of being put back in the corner. It took a bit for our server to come to our table, so the experience didn't start out too great.  I thought that the food was okay, but nothing to write home about.  I haven't been back since, and I honestly didn't even think about Buddy V's last time I was thinking about going to an Italian restaurant on the strip.  It's possible I might give it another shot.",

However, we stopped in for a late-night dinner after seeing the Beatles Cirque show at the Mirage, when not much else (even in Vegas) was open at 9:30pm on a Sunday. And Buddy's turned out to be the Boss. As in, very NJ Italian.  Caesar salad usually has hard-as-rock bread croutons. Not here. Buddy's croutons were amazing, soft, warm polenta/cheese cubes. Loved that! The Chicken Piccata was also very tasty, a generous portion with lots of capers and lemon. Very nice. Cute Italian breadsticks-in-wrappers on the table. Surprised and pleased with our meal.   Finally, don't get the weirdly-frosted cupcakes at the Carlo's bakery across from Buddy's (the ones with gobs of over-colored icing on the top). Instead, DO get their authentic Italian/NJ \"lobster claw\" pastries filled with cream. You could die. They were that good.",

I made a reservation in advance for a large party. The waiter only spoke to my husband and father in law. There were 11 of us. He had to be asked twice to take a drink order for the other 9 people at the table. When he came back he gave all the drinks to one person to pass around. He tried to upsell us while ignoring the majority of our table. He really pushed the 'family style' but would only explain it to my husband and father in law and seemed annoyed everyone didn't agree. One order was delivered wrong twice. When I asked if it would be removed from the ticket he got defensive and told me no. I had to ask for a  manager. He never offered refills on anybody's drinks but my husband and father in law who shared a bottle of wine. The support staff was great. Our waters were full the whole time, they were prompt with soft drink refills, brought us bread right away. We were there to celebrate the first grand children turning 21. His service ruined the experience for several of us. It was bazaar instead of enjoyable. I would not recommend unless it's just a few of you.",

We were early and they were still serving lunch so we ordered an appetizer so we could order off the dinner menu.  We got an order of Nina's mozzarella en carozza.  It was like having a toasted cheese sandwich with mozzarella cheese with some tasty marinara.  It was very good.  We shared the order and each had two wedges.  For our mains, my wife ordered  Nonna's lasagna.  It came with beef, pork, sausage, and four kinds of cheese and it was huge.  We could have split this between the two of us had we known how large it would be.  It probably weighed a pound at the very least and it was very good.  We brought 2/3 of it home and have it frozen for a meal for the two of us.  I got the Sunday Gravy.  How could I not go with his signature dish.  It's meatballs, sausage, lamb, and pork simmered in a Sunday gravy and served with a bowl of rigatoni.  The rigatoni was a sensible serving size, but when you added all the meat, this also was a dish that could have been shared.  This dish is worth the praise it gets from reviewers.  The Sunday gravy is excellent and the meat is so tender from the hours of cooking in the gravy!  Saving room for dessert, we opted to have part of this boxed also.  For dessert, we wanted something small and went with our server's recommendation of the Nutella Cake, cake with a warm Nutella center, chocolate sauce, some praline crunch, and served with salted caramel ice cream.  It was delicious and perfect to share at the end of the meal.  Our server, Graciela, was a gem.  She was around often to check on us.  The bus people refilled iced tea glasses quickly,  Service was very good!  The only drawback was the large Palazzo sign along the Boulevard which was at the level of the windows and was extraordinarily bright.  They have a shade which was partially lowered but it should have been lowered more or we should have changed our seating position at the table so our backs were toward the sign.  A very pleasant evening in a really good restaurant!",

I grabbed a glass of house red - not my fav but okay. I ordered the meatball small plate and the Mac n cheese small plate for my husband and I to share. The food was delicious. I really wanted to try the chicken parm but I wanted to stick to a small plate. Hm add a chicken parm slider!!!  So the happy hour menu has $4 drinks and $5 small plates. I will post a photo. The weird thing was that you could only get happy hour pricing if you say in certain spots of the bar. I laughed at the hostess. I have never been to a place that excludes certain bar seating. So if you want happy hour pricing - sit at the bar or the high tops. The low tables and other options are excluded",

The only reason I am giving four stars is, when I went there with my group of 4, the restaurant seating was fairly empty. They told me they didn't have a table available because I didn't have a reservation. She told me the bar area was open for all. Luckily there was a table in the bar that opened as I was having this conversation. As we sat there the restaurant really never filled up, not sure why I was told I couldn't be seated at a regular table.",

We were greeted by the hostess and only waited a few min to be seated for our reservation.  Peter, our server came right over and took our drink order - he was awesome!  He helped me choose my entree, the seared scallops ... which were beyond incredible.  They were served with polenta and shrimp - it was all cooked perfectly.  Polenta was creamy and a fantastic side with the scallops and shrimp.  The sear on the scallop was just right ~ they were tender and very fresh.  For dessert I decided on the butterscotch creme brulee - again, it was beyond perfect!  Holy cow!  Creamy, rich, just enough butterscotch flavor and the caramelized sugar on top with the pecan short bread cookies... I just couldn't stop eating-even after I was full!  The manager stopped by our table - she thanked us for being there and asked if there was anything we needed or had questions about.  Peter was attentive without being intrusive - he was well versed in all aspects of the menu from starters to drinks to desserts.  I am already excited to plan my next trip here.",

This has to be one of the best deals on the strip, and the best part is it's not just a deal for deal's sake, but it's good quality too.   We stopped in after having been at another happy hour nearby where it was quiet and more expensive.  Buddy V's was like a happy hour explosion in comparison, complete with live music!  I had $4 wine, while Husband had $4 beer.  We shared two $5 plates of Mac & Cheese Carbonara and Sausage & Pepper Sliders.  Both were really really good!  Warning though, that is a HOT pepper slice on top of the sliders (looked like a slice of tomato to me).  Really good sausage.  The real star of the show was that Carbonara.  Brilliant to make a mac & cheese version of it.  It was rich and creamy and the peas added a nice pop of freshness.   We would have ordered a lot more if we hadn't just come from another happy hour.  Next time, we'll head straight for this one, or come for a full meal, as we were impressed enough by the quality.  Our Server Gal did a great job, and we enjoyed the free entertainment of the Brothers so much that we tipped them well.",

Very casual, nice atmosphere - a touch loud, but to be expected.  We started with the recommended meatballs and Aunt Nina's mozzarella.  Both were good - the mozzarella was a little odd - like a grilled cheese but went well with the meatballs.  I'm not a big meatball fan, so just thought they were good - not sure what it would take for a meatball to be great.  The fresh bread was great.  For dinner we had lasagne, chicken parm and the rigatoni.  Everything was really good - especially liked the lasagne.  The rigatoni was good, but needed more chicken.  For dessert, they brought birthday cannolis, which were good.  There was a huge line at the associated bakery across the hall - didn't have time to check that out.",

Even though I specified that I wanted a private table, the host smacked me right in the middle of the room. Fortunately, there was one last table for two at the bar area that I was able to switch to before the whole place filled up. The tradeoff was the view, but the business was what was important.    After trying to decide between good reviews on chicken parmigiana and carbonara, I went with the chicken parm.  It was really delicious and was as tender as our server advertised. Maybe a little big portion for lunch, and it was priced as you would expect at the Venetian.   The service was not great. Other than promptly getting our order, it became essentially nonexistent.   I got confused who was actually helping us several times through our less-than-an-hour meal.  The bill was dropped off even before I had a chance to ask for dessert. I guess they wanted us to leave.   Although I had no complaints about the food and view, the service would prevent me from enthusiastically coming back, at least not during the busy lunch hour.",

The carbonara mac n cheese (I think is what it was) will have you battling your Nonna for the last bit in the bottom of the tray.   It's great for the holidays too. We came here for Xmas and thanksgiving and they always do a special spread.  The wait staff is always incredibly friendly and fast, even if they can be a bit quirky.  One of them accidentally gave my girlfriend a backhanded compliment, realized his misstep, and then saved himself.  It was actually kinda funny.  The attitude of the wait staff we've had has been to make sure you have a fun experience along with excellent service.  And we haven't been disappointed.",

    "text": "Recommendation:  Share an entree!!  I came to Buddy V's craving reasonably priced Italian food on the strip.  On a weekday night I had to wait for a table for 1.  I guess its a good sign that the restaurant is busy.  You might want to consider making reservations for larger parties.    The food and the sangria I ordered were good.  My biggest complaint about Buddy V's is the service and the amount of food thats served.  I normally order an appetizer and entree when I go out.  I asked for recommendations from the server at no point did he try to recommend food or portions that were reasonable.  He had the mindset of upsetting to increase my bill which I understand servers do, but its also helpful for them to be honest.   First I ordered the sangria.  I only saw it advertised by the pitcher, so I asked if I could just get a glass.  The server said that if I wanted more an 1.5 glasses (he pointed to a water glass on my table), then it makes sense to get the pitcher.  So I reluctantly agreed.  It was later that I noticed from another table that the sangria came in a larger glass then what he showed and would have been enough for me.  Not to mention after I poured out the sangria into my glass from the pitcher, the pitcher was full 34 full with ice.  What a rip off!  The calamari appetizer was good, fresh, and well prepared.  The appetizer was average size.  The entree I ordered was the Sunday Gravy.  It was about 2 pounds of cooked meat in red sauce, with a side of pasta.  Clearly enough food for 2 people.  I was upset because I asked the server what he recommended and had a couple dishes in mind.  At no point did he say one was twice the size of the other.  I ended up not touching the pasta and couldn't take it home as my hotel didn't have a fridge.  Everywhere else on my trip I was informed of portion size and asked if I wanted to order less, or the servers made suggestions about getting a different entree due to its size.",

    "text": "What an EXPERIENCE!  My wife and I were in Vegas for a short trip and as always wanted a dining experience.  We chose Buddy Vs and were not disappointed.  We had a 6:30 reservation on a Thursday.  Had a drink at the bar and enjoyed the live music that was playing in the bar area.  We then went to our table and were greeted by our waiter Giorgio who was born in Italy.  We told him we wanted an experience and with excitement he recommended the Intimate Dinner for Two.  Our only request was no octopus.  Warm bread straight from the pan was brought out.  We got a Black Rooster Chianti and Giorgio picked our second bottle.  We then were brought a plate of meatballs and a charcuterie board that would have made a great Italian hoagie.  Flavor was incredible and courses paced appropriately.  The main course followed with one plate containing a grilled lobster tail, pan fried sea bass pan with no breading, and pasta in a red sauce.  There was a second plate of linguini in a white sauce and a third plate of marinated sliced steak on a bed of mashed potatoes.  It was like having a bit of Venice, Rome and Tuscany at the table.  Throughout the meal Giorgio and the rest of the team would come by to make sure everything was to our satisfaction.  Seriously surpassed expectation.  We ended our meal with espresso and Frangelico, my wife had Amaretto and the dessert which was a plate with molten chocolate cake, toffee ice cream and a cream lobster tail.  Here is the kicker, all of that, remember two bottles of wine, for under $400.  It was truly the experience we were looking for in our meal.  Thanks to Giorgio and Emily the Manager for such a great evening.  If you are planning to go, make a reservation and ask for Giorgio.",

    "text": "Disclaimer: This review is for the experience of TRYING to eat here, NOT for the food! But trying to go to a restaurant--particularly when you are on a vacation or a Staycation--may be almost as important as eating, itself.  Went by Buddy's early in the day (in late morning), to look into dining later that night. I immediately LOVED the decor, and homey, yet elegant look. The awning, wood floors and red checkered table cloths go well together, and it feels like you are in South Street Seaport in New York.  But, the hostess was useless, and had little to tell me that morning.  She was not friendly. She seemed more interested in dancing by herself to the tune that was playing. (They play good music there). So, I just decided to return later that night with my dinner companion.   Well, that was a mess. Now, for the first time that evening (at around 6:15pm), I learn that we needed reservations, and that the wait was 45 minutes to an hour, which we were not willing to do on our schedule.  And again, the hostess was super useless. She did not apologize for the wait, or invite us to sit at the bar (which was empty), nor did she explain why there was such a lengthy wait when we could clearly see that there were at least 4 or 5 apparently empty tables in the foreground. Instead, she made it seem like we were complete fools for not having reservations.  Not a good tactic with your prospective customers.    And I have a pet peeve of restaurant hostesses dressed like they are headed to a trashy nightclub.  Does not fit the family vibe that Buddy's seems to be going for (especially with the quaintly named dishes after family relatives, such as Aunties and Grandma).  The bakery across from the restaurant seems much better run and friendly!   I might return, but it will take a while and maybe some convincing.",

The restaurant is classy yet casual. The ambiance is welcoming and doesn't make you feel like you are entering a \"yuppie\" restaurant. We were seated very quickly with my reservation. The kitchen is open so you can see the workers cooking and it is super clean. Smells delicious! I ordered a wine which was good. We had the mozzarella pesto bread as an appetizer. So good!!! Ok let's get to the meal. I had the rigatoni a la vodka. It was to die for! My partner ordered the chicken parm. It was so good too! We ate so much we couldn't get dessert. I'm sure those are delicious as well. Our waitress Kacie was very friendly and fast with service. I highly highly recommend this place. Buddy, great job  Came back 2019, September: if was delicious as expected. Our waitress, Grizella, was outstanding. I described the food as \"orgasmic\". It is so good.

We found Buddy V's. I was quite excited since we all know Buddy from Cake Boss is popular. Likewise, I wanted to taste real food from a Baker! But, it will be hard to find the restaurant since its located far out from the main mall area of the Venetian. Heads up!  It was a lunch buffet. So we had a lot of choices to try. They had the salad, appetizer section, a carving section, kiddie section, an array of Italian pastas etc.. and a whole table filled with desserts.   We wanted to try everything but that's not possible. The roast beef on the carving station looked good but it was extremely tough.   My favorites.. the smoked salmon, a pasta that was so delicious just don't know the name , his mama's Italian meatballs, a cold pasta dish and tiramisu. Just check out the photos. Lol.  We enjoyed the restaurant so much that we dined there with the family again prior to leaving Vegas. Our first and last restaurant on this trip. And we celebrated my cousins bday there too..it was convenient to get a birthday cake since Carlos Bakery is right across the restaurant.",

They give you a big piece of warm, fluffy rosemary focaccia bread to start, and it is incredible.  I ordered the Chicken Parmesan and it was cooked to perfection with a good sized (but not overwhelming) portion of pasta and a HUGE serving of chicken. This is more than enough to share. The dish came with two large pieces of Chicken Parmesan and I couldn't even finish one piece on my own. Unless you are absolutely starving or eat meals like The Rock does you will have leftovers (but I was also super hungry and couldn't make a dent, so use your judgement). But seriously check out my picture if you don't believe the size of this thing.  I also got to try a crouton from my friend's Caesar salad and WOW. It's not a crouton but more like a square of polenta, so if you like polenta definitely get the Caesar because it's so unique. If you are only down for boring old croutons then don't order salad or you will be highly disappointed.",

    "text": "My new favorite Italian spot! My GAWD is the food here phenomenal!!   My husband had been itching for a new place to try out, and of you've read my other reviews, we really don't like coming to the strip.   I tried making reservations on Open Table but they didn't have any spots available so I decided to call the restaurant directly ( recommended) I was able to get a reservation for 3 at 6:30.   We arrived a little late ( traffic on the strip) and we were still able to keep the reservation, I did call and let them know ahead of time of the situation. We were sat down and our sever came right over to us and introduced himself as Georgio, a True Italian OG. He made recommendations off and on the menu, which I always love to get!  We started off with the Mac and Cheese and Caesar Salad as an appetizer. It's not your ordinary Mac and Cheese and Salad. The Mac n cheese Carbonara has Smoked mozzarella, fontina, egg, pancetta, sweet peas, it's shareable between 2 people which is exactly what we did. Something that stood out of the salad was the croutons, they aren't just regular hard crunchy croutons, these were soft and had a lime zest to it. Turns out they are made out of polenta cheese and Italian cornmeal. It's really good   Now time for the fun part. I ordered the mother in law shrimp scampi and I instantly got a flavor of heaven!! Picture oven tomato, spinach, roasted garlic, white wine and mixed in with these plump huge shrimp!!! I've never had shrimp like this!!  My husband ordered the Valastro Sunday Gravy, it's  Buddy's family recipe. Meatballs, sausage, lamb, pork, bowl of rigatoni. Our sever wanted my husband to wait when his food came out so that he can show him the Italian way to eat his meal. I had to have a taste of his dish. So we did what any married couple does and picked off each other's plate. I loved his and he loved mine and together we can't wait to come back and try the other dishes that were recommended.",

My gf is a huge fan of buddy so of course we had to stop by buddy's but I'm glad we did! We just ordered a bunch of their apps because we didn't want to be too full for Carlos bakery!   We got the Mac and cheese carbonara, smashed meatball sliders, calamari, and gnocchi. The Mac and cheese was super cheesy and noodles were cooked well. Same with the gnocchi! The calamari was crisp and flavorful. Meatball sliders were my fav, for sure. The sauce was delicious!  Everything was very cheap for the taste and portion. I would definitely come back and recommend this to anyone! Especially those in Vegas on a budget who's looking for some good food!",

    "text": "I've written over 2300 reviews and I've only awarded 20 FIVE STAR reviews ever. As crazy as this sounds, Buddy V's is number 20...  I didn't know Buddy V was that crazy reality TV chef from TLC's Cake Boss. I've seen his show a few times, and he does seem to be a more talented baker than that slob Duff over on the Food Network. I actually chose this place based on the pictures and the great reviews. It also helped that it was right across the bridge from Treasure Island.    Why five stars? The service was impeccable. It had been a long time since we've received such great service from start to finish. To put it in perspective, the service here was better than all of the other restaurants we dined at during our trip to Las Vegas and from our home town of San Diego. We didn't expect to be treated like VIPs but that's how we were treated here for dinner.  Our drinks were always full, new silverware was replaced after each dish, and we were checked on often.   The food did not disappoint either.   The complementary focaccia bread with the balsamic vinegar/olive oil was so good. Don't be shy asking for more!   We started with Buddy's Caprese (burrata, roasted vine ripened tomato, tear drop tomatoes, balsamic, extra virgin olive oil). So delicious and perfect for two people to share. Nice zing to those tomatoes.  For our mains we ordered the Parm (oven-baked, provolone, mozzarella, spaghetti marinara) and the Picatta (lemon caper olive oil, linguine, garlic). Both were so tasty and the chicken was incredibly moist. At home we can never seem to cook chicken this tender, so this was absolutely incredible.  I get it, Buddy V's sounds like every other Las Vegas Celebrity restaurant. But the service and the food here make this the best restaurant in Las Vegas as far as I'm concerned. Even better than my favorite celebrity Chef, Gordon Ramsey and his Hell's Kitchen restaurant. I will definitely give Buddy V's my highest recommendation to friends planning on visiting Vegas.",

    "text": "I was worried to try this place... I live in the Bay Area and good Italian food that doesn't taste pre frozen or straight out of a can is hard to come by!   We came here for my sisters bday weekend and wanted to give it a try. By the looks of the pics the food looked pretty authentic and delicious!   They were able to accommodate our party of 9 and gave us a very spacious table right near the kitchen which we liked. Service was great, I don't remember our servers name but he was very efficient and nice! Answered all our questions multiple times and even recommended certain foods and the family meal and ways to share as a bigger party. I didn't realize we were there close to closing time and it was nice not to feel rushed at all! They made it seem like they would stay as long as needed.  I got the chicken parm and my husband got the lasagna and both were delicious! Chicken was so tender I could cut it with my fork! Sauce was delicious and the chicken perm had three types of cheese melted on top. Pricing was a bit High but worth it with the amount of food you got! They brought out warm bread with olive oil and balsamic (my fav!) and the lasagna was so cheesy and well made!   Atmosphere was nice and relaxing and can be a romantic classy dinner or just a casual come as you are place!   My only complaint is they rarely answer the phone! Took me a day and half to get a hold of them for a reservation and then day of about an hour to get through which is ok because they are busy but also might want to have more people answering calls.   Overall very satisfied and can't wait to come back!!!",

Ordered the Mac and cheese, sliders, calamari, and the gnocchi. Every single item had its own twist. The cheese in the Mac and cheese was a unique taste! Not sure what was in it but it was soooo good! I wasn't a huge fan of the sliders but my boyfriend was. The calamari was a good portion for a happy hour portion! Tasted good and loved the sauce. The gnocchi was a bit weird. It tasted like really healthy vegetables in cake form?! Not the typical gnocchis that's I'm used to.   Customer service was super friendly! Made us feel welcomed and the service was super quick! Will be back for sure !",

It has some bread crumbs on top - also new. For a nearly $30 dish, I was beyond disappointed. I'd love to hear from Buddy V's to understand what happened. This was always one of my musts when I visit Vegas but I am skeptical now that they've messed with perfection. I pray it was just a new cook and they didn't change the recipe.",

The bakery however is always very busy!  Our next visit was much more reasonable. We were able to get a table within a few minutes around 4pm.  The atmosphere is a more relaxing classic Italian setting, than say Lavo which can get pretty loud.  To start off my wife ordered a Sangria and I got a Moscow Mule. Both were very good and I'd say even keel when it comes to alcohol content.   The Focaicca bread to start off with was warm and very good. We had seconds, it was sooo good!  I ordered the traditional spaghetti and meatballs. Ive always heard the meatballs were good here so I had to try them out. They were made from (lamb, pork, and beef) They were really good, light and tasted homemade, and the cheese tastes like it was freshly grated.  My wife had the Panzanella salad( buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes, cucumbers, focaccia croutons, baby arugula, caramelized onions, balsamic vinaigrette with added chicken. The salad was the size of a football field! She loved it and the chicken was moist and tender.   The Portions were on the larger size, but we were able to finish them, unfortunately we had no room for dessert which was a shame because the cannolies looked really good!  Next we're going to try the chicken parm and Eggplant, the table next to us ordered it and it looked amazing. They said it was really good as well.",

    "text": "Very good Italian food. We came here for happy hour and ordered from both menus. The staff was very nice. We were first seated in the regular area and asked about happy hour and got moved to the bar. It had a lot of room with a great view. I got the meat ball sandwich with a gnocchi (not made with potatoes) it was a corn bread kind of texture. Very good. The meat ball sliders were very filling. Their bread is very good. We also got shrimp scampi, the best shrimp and just regular spaghetti. All delicious. Their house sangria was very nice a mixture of white and red. Over very good happy hour time with great staff.",

    "text": "This was very good!  It has a nice upscale casual vibe and I love the decor in here! The bundt pans on the walls, rolling pin walls, etc. are fun without being tacky. There are a lot of italian restaurants in Vegas but very few of them are 'approachable' like this one. We aren't fancy and well-versed in upscale italian dishes - we like to be able to read the menu and know what we're getting! This place fit the bill while still being a nice sit down meal. The bread basket was an added bonus.   I had the chicken fettuccine alfredo. It tasted great and the portion was good-sized but it still tasted very light which is unusual for a pasta dish, however it was much appreciated in the Vegas heat!  I also tried the pepperoni pizza. I think the size was fair. It was okay - very fresh tasting, the sauce is especially bright. But I probably wouldn't order this again, I think there are better pizzas in Vegas.  My mom had the lasagna and she was impressed. I am not a lasagna person, personally, but I've been with people who do order it many times and most restaurants can't actually pull it off so I was surprised!  Our waitress was probably the biggest negative thing about this place. She was not very attentive and we couldn't find her when we needed her. On the other hand, the man attending to drinks in our area and boxing up orders and such was friendly and quick to help in her absence. He got a nice tip from us, larger than and separate from the waitress.  I will definitely be coming back and highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates non-fussy italian like we do!",

    "text": "An Italian brunch buffet? By buddy v? YES and YES. This buffet killed every aspect - the tomato soup was incredible, the Caesar salad, chicken parm, mac n cheese carbonara, all of it was delicious! The tomato soup was almost a mix between a creamy tomato broth and Mariana sauce. The Mac n cheese carbonara was such a unique spin on two of my favorites. So cheesy and so creamy, I kept grabbing more. Of course the classic chicken parm is a fan favorite. Each dish had so much flavor and tasted just like a home cooked meal. I couldn't decide which station to keep going back to first. The food just kept being brought out so everything was always fresh and never ran out.   Throw in the desserts, woah. Tiramisu, chocolate mousse, cannolis - you name it. My favorite was the chocolate mousse and it was so rich.   Italian that stands out is sometimes hard to find and when it's produced on such a large scale like for a buffet, it might all just taste ok but not here. Highly recommend this buffet and especially this restaurant. I would love to come back and try a full dish, but a great way to try a little bit of everything!",

Their food spoke for itself from their appetizers, dinner, to dessert. Their cheese board is a MUST and worth the price. The lasagna had a good balance w/ cheese and tomato sauce, but for dessert.... the Butterscotch Creme Brule was sooooo good from the sugary shell and the vanilla mascarpone cream. Their customer service was just the cherry on top SHOUT OUT TO PETER bruhh! I can't wait to try their brunch (.... bottomless mimosa and bellinis!)",

    "text": "Was super excited to come here being a huge lover of Italian food and a Cake Boss fan.  We were seated relatively quickly in the \"patio\" area for their happy hour.  We started off with small bites right away, but our waiter never came back to take our freaking entree order.  We sat there patiently for half an hour after finishing our appetizers.  He specifically knew we were ordering more since we said we'll start off with the appetizers and asked to leave the menu since we were still ordering an entree.  While we were waiting for him to come back, the host grabbed the menu off our table and gave it to the table next to us, without even asking if we were done. We continued waiting and were so annoyed we didn't even order more food. So after 60 minutes of waiting for them to take our order, even though we told someone to grab out waiter so we could order earlier, we just asked for the check, which took another 30 minutes.  It's not like it was busy. Maybe 25% of the restaurant was full, and they had a separate person seating, a separate person taking order, another delivering the food, and another cleaning the tables and refilling water. Not to mention he was one of like 4 waiters, and the place isn't that big.  He charged us $16 for a medium beer, which is totally fine, but other waiter told us it should've only costed us $12, and then they said just kidding.  Seems kind of steep to go from $9-small and $16-medium. I'm a waiter so I'm pretty big on tipping.  Didn't bother to tip as the service was awful. I think our waiter's name was Danny or something. The host sucked too for grabbing our menu without asking, like dude, come on.  They were middle aged people so this was most likely their full time job since we went on a Thursday. You suck at your job guys.",

    "text": "We went at prime time for dinner. The place was so full we had to wait 45 minutes for a table.  Once we were seated though the place was great. Service was good though a bit slow at times, the waiter was really passionate about the food and was able to recommend several options for my parents who don't normally eat Italian.   We ordered the osso buco, the shrimp scampi, and the gravy with rigatoni. All the food came out hot, and parmesan was very quick to be offered.  The food tasted great. Like the waiter said, the osso buco literally fell off the bone, I didn't need the knife at all. It was a bit oily, but otherwise very good. The polenta it was served with was creamy and well seasoned. I felt some vegetables/salad would have gone down nicely, but it was very good overall.  The shrimp scampi tasted very good, but the pasta seemed slightly overcooked (by maybe half a minute) and the sauce a little scarce. Flavour wise it was brilliant.   The gravy was probably the least impressive in my opinion, the sauce just needed something extra in terms of flavour to really make the meat stand out.  Portion sizes were generous, originally we were keen for dessert or a visit to the cake store just opposite, but it was a bit too much.   Overall it was a very good meal and one of the few decent Italian places I've been to in Vegas or anywhere else and it shows in how busy they were, but it seemed slightly let down by some small details.",

The peas were perfect and POPPED in your mouth. The panchetta was a perfect contrast to the silky smooth sauce and the crunchy bread crumb top provided a great texture to the top. The meatballs were fantastic and the bread with ricotta cheese was fantastic. Ask for Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar on the side. I ordered a melon martini off the drink menu. It was light, bright and strong! Had a wonderful bit of mint and citrus zest throughout. Lastly we rounded out the dinner with the Nutella Cake!! Oh my GOSH!!! I am not a BIG fan on Nutella and ate around the dollop in the center. The cake was extremely moist! The Salted Carmel ice cream that is made in house at their other restaurant was SUPERB!!! Loved the peanut brittle on the bottom. Try each one seperate and after all together you will NOT be disappointed! We sat in the bar by the window and the view was great. Loved the decor with the rolling pins hanging throughout and HUGE beaters mixed in with the lights. We had a great night! Enjoy!",

A four because my Drago Rosso cocktail was very good, a touch of spice and the mango garnish was delish.

A 4 because they said they'd sit us anyway, and we did within 5 minutes, but how do you lose my reservation?

I am allergic to fennel and was assured by the waiter that pasta dish I ordered was in the clear.  Several in the group ordered the  Sunday gravy and were in heaven.  The chicken Parmesan was also a hit (a dish I had on my first visit several months ago). One couple in the group ordered the  waiters favorite grandmas meatballs.

We will definitely be coming back! Thanks, Peter for the great service! Oh, and the prices are so reasonable! Between $30-$50 per plate but it has the atmosphere more like a fine dining setting.",

The tiramisu had a chocolate cake surprise at the bottom. I hate the word moist but that's exactly what it was...MOIST. I couldn't stop eating it. Nice views so ask for a table by the window. The restaurant is not easy to find so just ask for directions...don't wander around.",

She barely spoke, her hair was in my drink and she really didn't do anything more than what she had to. We witnessed another customer, 2 women waiting to be served. They started at the bar, moved to a table, moved to another table and waited and waited and the waitress/bar tender never helped them so they left. It wasn't busy either. As far as food, I had the Italian cake and I wasn't impressed. I'm not a cream person so maybe that's why I didn't like it.",

    "text": "So disappointed. Not what I was hoping for. This was my very first experience at a celebrity chef restaurant. I had high hopes. The atmosphere was nice, homey touches here and there, nicely decorated, and cute touches like whisks for the light figures. My disappointment was with the food. I ordered the chicken Marsala on the advice of our server.  Unfortunately, my chicken was not properly trimmed, and had a large strip of fat on both pieces. In addition, the chicken was overcooked and chewy. (A patron at the next table had chicken rigatoni, and felt his chicken was overcooked as well). It seemed like the chicken breasts had been cooked earlier in the day and then reheated. The Marsala sauce did not have the sweet flavor you usually taste with Marsala, and tasted more like a simple brown sauce with very little flavor. The side pasta that came with the Marsala was well cooked, well seasoned, and quite tasty. My husband ordered the lasagne, as it was a \"specialty\" according to the server. The lasagne was fine, although not really any better than other Italian restaurants I have tried. It is heavy on the veal, and heavily seasoned with anise.  If you really like anise, it's definitely the lasagne for you. We ordered the famous lobster tail for dessert.  It was a very small portion for the price ($9 for a piece the size of a very small pear) and did not taste fresh. The cream filling was very good, but the pastry was very chewy and even hard to cut through.  On the plus side, the service was very good, and the focaccia before dinner was also very good.  I was just disappointed that the food was not better quality for the price.",

    "text": "Calamari is mediocre, like many other places in Vegas it is overhyped. They are not flexible. Bread is very tasty with oil and vinegar. The main attraction is the desserts. The Caesar salad has delicious cornbread croutons that are soft. Chicken Parmesan is well made not anything special. The chicken piccata is excellent and very flavorful. Tomato Basil soup is well but not anything special. The lasagna is on par with several franchise locations nothing extravagant. The Nutella cake taste like any other chocolate cake I could faintly taste the Nutella. The salted carmel Ice cream and raspberry sherbet is excellent and has a unique flavor. The cannoli is very good as well and is a must to order if you come here I will say the service is excellent. Waiters are very attentive and are aware of their customers desires and level of drinks. The service is very friendly and insightful on the menu.       In conclusion many of the dishes are very normal tasting. The desserts are very good overall. It is overpriced for what you get in respect to food but I say it's good to try once. If you are in for the deserts the bakery across has the same ones but will have a long wait.",

He had an eye on everything and was always dropping in to all the tables to make sure everyone was having a good time and if anything was needed. Always managing to take away a stray glass or refill an empty one as he chatted. I asked for the appy Eggplant Parmigiana as I wasn't too hungry. When he brought it out he said \"don't get upset now but I upgraded you to the entree size, no charge, but it is just too delicious to eat just a small bit\". He was right - best ever and since my sisters took a fair bit off my plate, it worked out well. For dessert we ordered one cannoli to split. We were so full! Anyway what does he do but come out with 3 (no charge) because it would be \"terrible\" if we couldn't pick them up with our hands and  eat one each to ourselves. He was right again and they were incredibly delicious! Best host ever! Great dining experience!!!!!!",

    "text": "After trying to get a table at other places, we went here. It's not that we didn't think it would be good, but didn't want to go to yet another celebrity-associated restaurant. Enough with the names and prices to go with it. We were pleasantly surprised at how much we enjoyed it.   There was a wait at 8pm on a Sunday night, so reservations help. We were told the wait would be an hour. We made reservations on-line and only waited 25 minuets!   The decor is nice-- the ceiling light fixtures are cool. Big whisk attachments-cool use for them. They have an open kitchen and it smells wonderful. Lots of red and dark wood, feels very comfortable.   We ordered a Caesar salad, garlic bread and panzenella salad to start. The Caesar salad was the best I've had in a long time. Very garlicky, croutons that were warm, soft with a little crunch and a hint of fennel in the salad.  Just the perfect amount of fresh Parmesan cheese. The panzenella was delicious with the same lovely bread, fresh tomatoes and a great dressing. The garlic bread was cheesy, dense and delicious. Just like you imagine good garlic cheese bread should be.   For dinner, we ordered the spaghetti Bolognese ( for the little one), lasagna, and the Sunday Gravy. The little one wanted lasagna instead, so I traded with him. The kids' spaghetti was plenty for an adult ( I left half of it at that) and incredible. Some of the best I've had that I can remember. The lasagna, although expensive for what it is, was equally delicious. Baked in a cast-iron pan, it was warm, gooey and delicious, with a light tomato sauce on top. The Sunday Gravy was good, but he agreed that  the Bolognese and lasagna were infinitely better.   We didn't order dessert, but those around us who ordered got cannoli, which looked fantastic. By the way, Carlo's Bakery is across from Buddy V's if you want something for later.   We would definitely go back and definitely recommend!",

The fries were excellent, and our waitress had the kitchen made a larger caprese salad for us so we could share it. It turned out it was burrata cheese, which was awesome. Hubby had the enormous veal parmesan chop and it was the size of a dinner plate. Our friend had the lasagna, and I had the scallops. All the entrees were excellent. They miss the mark a little on dessert. Although I had a molten nutella cake which was delish, hubby had the Italian birthday cake which was extremely bland and very disappointing. Our friend had the lemon cheesecake, which had a nice bright lemony flavor, but I'm just not a fan of cheesecake, so I can't impartially rate that. Overall, a great dining experience, although the place is extremely loud and I was hoarse by the end of the meal from trying to be heard over the din! Oh, and Buddy was actually there that night making the rounds saying hello to people. That was kind of fun too!",

    "text": "So the wife and I went to Buddy V's last night and here are my thoughts.  Overall it was a good dining experience, but not a great one.  I wasn't bowled over by either the service or the food, (except for the desert).  It was just kind of okay and most likely won't go back. First off, the restaurant is tucked away in a spot that has a fantastic view of the Strip, but the internal design was emotionally cold.  I want an Italian-American restaurant to be warm and inviting and this place was trying too hard to be fancy, (which is most likely a result of its being in the Venetian).  We didn't order any appetizers but for entrees my wife had the Veal Marsala and I had the Chicken Parm.  My wife and I both loved the taste of our meals.  They were both well prepared but both were a bit on the small side for the money they are charging. The Chicken Parm had only two cutlets and the side of spaghetti was only about a half a cup's worth.  Same with the wife's dish.  Like I said both tasted real good, but not really any better than any other Italian joint in town. Also, they give you fancy Focaccia bread with dinner.  Sadly they offer no butter or Olive oil to go with it and really, the bread had a distinctive taste to it, which made it non-optimal for dipping.  I'd rather have warm, fresh, and plain Italian bread over the fancy stuff.  For desert we shared a Tiramisu and that was fantastic.  The quality and taste of it was spot on.   As far as the service, the wait staff was very attentive.  Our waiter was professional but a bit stoic.   We probably won't go back because I can get just as good Italian food from a local spot 10 minutes from my house but the desert was great so maybe it's worth it to try lunch there instead of dinner paired with desert.",

The only other issue was that we got a child's pizza for my son and it arrived after the rest of us were done with our meals. But the problem was fixed again by same manager and they took it off our bill.",

    "text": "It was mine and my husbands 14 year anniversary and I was looking for a fantastic restaurant for us to go out to for a romantic evening! I was recommended by a friend to try Buddy Vs because she works as a concierge on the strip and said it has been a pretty popular choice among tourists.... Let me start by saying people must like this place bc of the fact that it's owner has a tv show because I was very unimpressed!  Ok, let me say that it is a beautiful restaurant but not much for a romantic evening... My husband and I were sat at a table barely large enough to hold out plates on, and we were in between 2 other larger parties! We felt completely cramped and not the least bit romantic! However we decided to try to make the best of our night and ordered some of our favorite Italian dishes! When our food arrived I wouldn't put it too far past a fast food Italian taste! There was nothing great about our food and most definitely not worth the price! We are locals who love good Italian food and there are many, and I do mean many, that we have tried off the strip who far exceed Buddy Vs! We will leave this restaurant for the tourists!",

Started off with a nice Brunello and Caprese with burrata cheese and organic heirloom tomatoes,  accompanied with grilled Italian bread. The manager Kristina was very attentive and brought us their nicest red wine glasses for our Brunello, which we really appreciated. The Caprese was one of the best my husband and I have ever tasted. We have been blessed to spend lots of time in Italy and have had some spectacular Italian meals. Buddy V's was right up there with the best we've had in Florence, Rome and Tuscany. The pasta was perfectly al dente, prepared by Executive Chef Bryan, who we had the pleasure of meeting. We finished our meal with their spectacular cannoli's that were clearly made fresh to order based on their crunchy shell. We can't say enough about our experience at Buddy V's.....from the hostess, busboys, server, managers. This group definitely worked well together just like a big Italian family.",

We usually do this at all the tourist places that offer this. We thought our daughters would love them. They love watching the cake boss. Usually they will bring you a new glass wrapped up and you're set.  When we got back from our trip we gave the boxes to our daughters and they opened them and here they were the glasses we drank out of and had beer residue and lemonade residue in it. How embarrassing. The beer one smelled so bad. I thought we were getting new glasses. They could have at least washed them. Good thing we gave them to our kids and not someone else. They were horribly dirty.  Our Server was explaining the appetizers and I heard absolutely nothing he said.  We were sat at a small table for two and I maybe said 5 words the whole time. Because it was too hard to carry on a conversation.  It was our last night in Vegas and I wanted something romantic and memorable.  When I think of Italian food I think romantic and intimate.  It was not. That's the only thing I didn't enjoy.   Food and drinks were amazing.",

The focaccia should've been warm, and why do we need to ask for olive oil? That's not authentic . We had chicken parm and pasta. We said we were sharing but plates were just dumped. Had a very nice bus boy but the waiter was creepy and a little scary. The chicken parm was good, pasta was a little on the creamy side. Overall pretty mediocre for the Boss, hope the cakes are better and they hire some pleasant waiters",

I was severely underwhelmed by the lunch menu and felt like I was at universal studios at buca di beppo. Tourist trap. 3 stars because it wasnt bad and price was fine. Just not great and certainly not worth trying while in Vegas. Oh and the entrees are splitable despite their up sale attempts. Again think buca's",

    "text": "The hubs and I RARELY go out for Italian food. Why? Well, because we can make most of the dishes at home with high quality ingredients. Well, when I had some family in town, I suggested all of us going to Buddy V's only because :1. Pit stop at Carlo's Bakery; 2. It's easy for me to get back on the I-15 to head back to suburbia. 3. Italian food is always safe when entertaining guests. Well, my cousins decided to day drink while waiting for me to get off of work, so by dinner time, they were fighting off a massive hangover. And it wasn't even 5 PM. Then they blew us off.  The hubs and I decided to take advantage of our time together with our diva because we both had lobster tails from Carlo's Bakery on our mind. We figured, dinner was going to be a bonus, so I don't have to cook and clean, and we made the trek from suburbia to the Strip.  We checked in for our reservation and was seated within a couple of minutes. When I made the reservation, I requested a table along the windows for the view. I noticed all the tables along the windows were designed for larger parties and I was prepared for them to seat us at a smaller table since our party decreased from 6 to 3. But no, they get a high five for seating our party of 3 at the  primo table that had a view of the Strip as well as a view of Carlo's Bakery so we can keep an eye on our number.  Our server, was personable, just a tad slow. I'll take 'a tad slow' over crappy personality any day. We ordered: Kids Margharita Pizza Grandma's meatballs Caesar salad Chicken Parmesan Agnolotti  I enjoyed  everything that we ordered. I thought the pizza crust was outstanding; thin, crunch AND chewy, perfect amount of sauce and cheese. The meatballs were heavenly. The Caesar salad took us by surprise. When it arrived at the table, we thought the salad looked dry. But when we took our first bite, we understood why it looked like it was dry. It was one of the best Caesar salads I've ever had. It didn't need all that dressing because each bite had the perfect amount of acid, garlic, cheese and saltiness from the anchovies. The croutons were unique; I forgot to ask but I think it was made out of polenta. The croutons were perfect to dip with the meatballs. I had the Chicken Parmesan; it was good not great. MY hub's agnolottis were divine. Hand made, they were filled with veal shank, sausage and pork with a creamy, sage brown butter. The one complaint I had was I thought the agnolotti pastry was a tad thick but the flavors were very good.  All together, we spend $113 with tip for 2 adults and a princess. A tad high for a family dinner, but overall, it was a great experience for us. Too bad my cousins were too drunk. But that's what you do in Vegas.",

The ambience was very laid back, with piano music playing as we were overlooking the Las Vegas strip. The musician even came over to the tables to see how we were enjoying ourselves. I eat Italian food very regularly as I am Italian and from Boston, and this was up there with the best Italian dishes I've ever had!!!   The busser was so sweet and attentive we thought he was our server at first! Could not bring us enough bread or help us enough!! However the waitress had no personality, was rude when we asked about the happy hour specials and really did nothing for out experience. Overall I would recommend this to all!!!!!",

Since it was obvious that we were going to be seated at the bar section, Kelly reminded me that bars likely do not allow minors in their section since Katharine is only 17 so I informed the hostess. She apologized and asked us to return to the front for reassignment. For the next 10 minutes three other similar sized parties are seated ahead of us. We end up sitting in a table next to the waiters' cashier station. Not much of an issue since we were still towards the front of the restaurant. We open two of the three menus and the entree pages are missing. Kelly walks over to the hostess station to show them this and picks up new menus. This slight hiccup at the beginning of the evening would've been disastrous for most establishment but Buddy V's made up and bent backwards to ensure our satisfaction. GM Christopher and his manager kept checking on us to make sure we were ok. We ordered the Caprese to start and had the Shrimp Scampi, Spaghetti and Meatballs, and Spaghetti Bolognese. All fantastic! We finished with the Apple Pie topped with a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream. They do a really good job with their food. If you ever get the chance to visit one of their restaurants, it is well worth it!",

I had ordered different things every time and every dish is better that the last one. And lets not forget the dessert I've got the Tiramisu every time and its the best dessert ever. I've also tried the chocolate cake and its amazing. So if you decide to go you won't be disappointed",

The desserts are from none other than Carlo's bake shop so you'll be in for a fine treat. I personally ordered the Sunday Gravy entree and it was one of the best Italian dishes I've had in awhile. It's tomato stew served with tender veal, homemade Italian sausage and meatballs served with rigatoni. Think of it as spaghetti with meatballs but more variety of meat for you meat lovers. A great experience overall!",

Make reservations in advance or take a chance with the bar area, which can give you a great view of the strip.  When I was previously here, there was live music with people dancing next to the bar area, but they didn't have a band this time. Not sure if this was due to a slow season in December.  Overall a very lovely atmosphere with great food.",

    "text": "Did not know much about Buddy V background and his rep on desserts. We went in a couple years ago as guests at Palazzo. Now it's a staple on our liSt based on the food. It's not a huge menu but what they got is goooddd. I always go for the chicken parm. Two big breasts and a side of pasta. It's plenty for two. Other folks in our party had bucatini and it was rich with great fresh pasta. Was not over sauced to allow all flavors. We did the Price Fix menu which for $40 bucks gets you an app, entree and choice of dessert (cannoli or tiramisu). Meatball appetizer was really good though they are a little on the small size compared to Carmine's, Lavo or Matrianos. Chicken parm is a little thicker than other places but keeps the chicken juicy without too much breading. The red sauce on the parm and pasta side is super fresh tomato taste. We had one each of the cannoli and Tiramisu. Cannoli was crunchy with cream and chocolate chunks with a side of chocolate syrup. Wow was it good. Tiramisu was also very good and I liked because not to bitter with coffee taste. It comes in a little jar with a couple of side cookies. Both great for sharing at the table. Atmosphere is really good with view looking over the strip. Nice bar/lounge area with live music some nights. Service was really good and efficient.",

    "text": "So I never watched the Cake Boss and only ended up at Buddy V's because they had space for our party during a busy Saturday night.  We were seated at the worst possible table in the restaurant right up in the front and the hostess wouldn't budge when I asked to be moved after I saw a lot of tables available since it was 9:30pm (strike 1).  Our waiter was fast talking and nice but he really tried his best to have us order more than we wanted and actually charged us for a salad which he said was going to give us compliments of the house and then forgot all about his promise at the end of the dinner (strike 2).  Those two experiences were the True reason why I brought the score down because the food (except for the salmon) was very fresh and delicious.   Charred Octopus-amazingly good Panzanella Salad-fresh combination of flavors Seared Salmon-overcooked and dry (strike 3). Buddy V's is a very large and pretty modern restaurant with decent prices but the little incidences along the way had me leaving on a sour note.",

    "text": "Meh, Buddy V's is a 3.5 stars for me but rounding down because of slow service and complicated bill -_-  I made a reservation at Buddy V's for my birthday. We were a large party of 15 that seated us pretty quickly once our whole party arrived. I know that we were a large party but I just felt like the overall service was very slooow.....The older man (maybe the manager) walked us very s l o w l y....to the table and as we were seated, it just took a long time to get our utensils or menus. It was around 4:45 when we arrived and the restaurant didn't look too crowded at the time.  I am a huuuge fan of moscow mules and I make it a point to try a restaurant's signature mule. Buddy V's has a \"Jalapeno Mule\" on their cocktail menu and I was instantly intrigued and pleasantly surprised upon tasting it. It was bright and zesty, but the subtle kick of jalapenos would kick in afterwards. It's not a really overwhelming spice, but rather quite refreshing. Highly recommend trying this!  And for my meal, I ordered the linguini and clams and shared with my friend who ordered the sea scallops. Much to my disappointment, the linguini was super salty and extra garlicly. I didn't mind the garlic but the salt was just too much for me and found myself taking gulps of water in between bites. The sea scallops on the other hand were quite enjoyable. The creamy bed of polenta beneath the beautifully seared scallops complemented it well.  The dessert was probably the highlight of the meal. The Italian birthday cake was soo delicious. I'm not a big fan of desserts because I don't have much of a sweet tooth but the sweetness of all the different layers was not very overpowering in this. I loved the chocolate mouse layer. So dreamy....  It was time for the check and here's where things got unnecessarily complicated. Again, service was slow and we seemed to be waiting for forever for the check to come out. Prior to even ordering I had asked if we could split the check into separate bills, by tables, since we were a large party. They had forgotten, but no big deal, I asked them if they could fix it and they said they would. We wanted to split the bill to put it on two separate cards. When they brought back the check and I took a look at it, I was so confused. Our server had literally split everything on the check in half (see my photos), which made it 39247038x more difficult for my party to figure out who we needed to pay back. I clarified with our waiter what I wanted and off he went to fix our check. What could possibly go wrong? So instead of just ringing up another two new bills, he took a looong time trying to move halves from the two checks around. So instead of \"linguini and clams\" on the bill it said \"1/2 linguini and clams\" twice. He spent a long time trying to move things around but didn't move everything properly. I think it would've taken equally as long to just create two new bills where each meal was not a half.  So yeah, that was frustrating to deal with. Everyone was getting grumpy because we had been in the restaurant for so long because of the slow service and we were ready to leave after two hours of being there. But our waiter did try...and he was nice...just not efficient. Overall, good food and a nice interior! However, I was expecting a little more from the service since it wasn't too crowded but hey, they tried.",

We also had the Nutella cake with a scoop of ice cream if this wasn't a snack I'd say you can finish the lasagna on your own but it was a perfect share.

    "text": "Truly impressive restaurant with Strip view.  I've been coming to Buddy Vs for a few years now. No weekend trip to Vegas has been complete for me without Sunday brunch here. Their Bruch buffet features high quality breakfast and lunch dishes, fresh premium fruits, cheese, Italian cold cuts and best of all: the desert bar. The service has always been good and the overall value is reasonable for a major resort Strip front restaurant.  Today I came for regular lunch. We ordered the salami and cheese platter, spaghetti Bolognese and tiramisu. As always, the food was outstanding. The three cheeses and three meats were of the finest quality and paired with freshly open-fire grilled garlic butter feloni bread. The Bolognese, while a simple dish, has always been one of our favorites here, as they do it perfectly. Saving the best for last, the tiramisu by itself is worth coming here for (and it's served as part of the Sunday brunch buffet as well !!). I also loved their new coffee from Fonte, which is a perfect pair with the tiramisu.  The weeks before Christmas are always slow, so we were able to get a table by the window with excellent Strip view. Danny did an outstanding job taking care of us and making this a truly enjoyable lunch at one of my favorite restaurants.",

Buddy Valastro's Italian accent makes my heart skip a beat, and the delicious dishes he's serving up at his self-named restaurant in Vegas will do the very same!  Work trip.  Boooo.  But in Vegas? Hell yeah.  I stayed at the monumental Venetian hotel and had the most luxurious suite of suites.  It was late.  I was tired.  I was hungry, and to make matters worse, I was indecisive of what to eat. (Don't you hate that feeling?)  One of my suppliers suggested grabbing a bite at a place called Buddy V's.  \"Oh like Eddie V's brother?\" I asked.  \"Nooo.  Buddy V's as in Buddy Valastro.  The Cake Boss,\" she replied. Ahhh.  How did I not know this?    We grabbed a table towards the back, and I acquired the perfect view.  It was about 10PM and I was facing the Las Vegas Strip--the beaming lights shining down on the commotion of pedestrians as they scurried towards the various hotels and casinos.  For my first time in Vegas, this, ladies and gentlemen, was a sight!    I gulped down the most delicious glass of cab, and ordered the spaghetti carbonara and added Italian sausage, per the waiter's suggestion.  It used to frustrate me watching Diners, Drive Ins and Dives because every other episode, Guy Fieri exclaims \"this is the best ________ I've ever had!\"  When you say that about every dish, what makes one different from the other? Driving my point home, the Spaghetti Carbonara at Buddy V's Ristorante was THE BEST PASTA DISH I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!!! And I'm not Guy Fieri-ing you.  The pasta is obviously made in-house, and that sauce is ridiculously rich and creamy.  The Italian sausage just drove the dish right on home for me.  Buddy V's is... Simply put? OUT OF BOUNDS, and I can't wait to get back to Vegas and eat there again and again!",

    "text": "Having enjoyed dinner shortly after opening with friends in town from Phoenix, the plan to re-visit Buddy V's at a later date somehow getting lost in the constant shuffle of Las Vegas' restaurant landscape, recent rumors from a trusted source suggested that the All You Can Eat Sunday Brunch pairs a good price to food better executed than it needs to be, something each day more difficult to find in the Casino properties of Sin City.  No doubt still a hot-spot amongst tourists, the restaurant itself just under capacity by noon as the line at Carlo's Bake Shop continues to snake out the door at all hours of the day, it was just past 11:15am that one adult and a child checked-in at the hostess podium to be quickly led to a tight two-top adjacent the open kitchen, food displays tempting on all sides as the decor of rolling pins, whisks and ingredients continues to impress without making the environment feel like a 'theme' restaurant in the least.  Half-expecting service to be sub-par, most of the full-time Buffets in town generally better suited to this style of dining than a place converting the dining room into a free-flowing event once a week, it was with greetings from a young man who poured water and occasionally returned to clear plates or refill Coffee that instructions were given to \"get started whenever you like,\" a quick perusal of the options that are mostly laid out on the tableside menu showing a decent variety, though certainly not the same multitude of options as the Hotel's AYCE space.  Obviously focusing on Italian American classics and Buddy's interpretation of the topic by way of long-time Chef Brian Forgione, it was with a plate of Charcuterie, Cheese and Baked Goods that the meal got underway, the 9-year old happy to see Peel n' Eat Shrimp offered, but confused as to why the Salami did not taste like the version offered at Von's, the quality theoretically superior and not nearly as processed but nonetheless lacking in flavor while the Prosciutto, Blue Cheese and Pecorino were all good specimens, though the Focaccia was nearly inedible and hard enough to make one wonder whether it had been baked the previous day.  Modestly impressed by the Croissant as well as two mini-Muffins, a Pain au Chocolat entirely forgettable as a result of too little filling, the decision to investigate the Cake Boss' desserts early was well served by a pot of Tiramisu that would rival any in town, the Red Velvet Cake also quite tasty with a most base and tangy frosting while the Cannoli was much like that across the way, already feeling the sog of being pre-filled and generally underwhelming.  Batting about .500 on Italian Cookies, the Almond Cluster and soft Chocolate far better than the dried Butter rounds topped in Sprinkles or Jam, it was with patience that a fresh pan of pasta was waited on as part of plate three, the Mac n' Cheese Carbonara far too heavily salted to be appreciated for any sort of subtlety while the small Breasts of pounded Chicken Parm and Orecchiette with Italian Sausage were better balanced if not particularly memorable, the surprisingly light Roast Vegetable Frittata offering some evidence of a kitchen that is capable of doing 'high volume' right.  Far more impressed by the Garlic Bread than the Focaccia, crispy and fragrant with just melted Mozzarella or when used to scoop up Grandma's Meatballs and Sauce that takes no short-cuts en route to a fresh Tomato flavor without any added sweetness, choices from the carving station including Spicy Italian Sausage and Smoked Applewood Slab Bacon are well-displayed and prepared properly, the youngster at the table also fond of the Maple-Glazed Ham and sticks of Beef Jerky procured from the Bloody Mary Bar.  Going back to the sweet stuff for plates five and six, the common occurrence of dirty stacked plates and an empty mug at this point almost more amusing than it was an annoyance, fans of Bread Pudding would be well advised to save room for Dessert as the version served hot from a steamer with Caramel Sauce and Whipped Cream is a custard-laden masterpiece that far outperformed Panettone French Toast that is a bit dry along the edges, a better investment for the sweet tooth being the dainty Crespelle served with Nutella, Pureed Raspberries and Whipped Cream...or perhaps a bag of piping hot Italian Donuts offered with the same trio for dipping.  **1/2Charged $36.95 per adult and $10.95 for a child, a price not inclusive of tax or tip, the question of whether Buddy V's Brunch is 'worth it' comes down to whether one prefers quality or quantity as well as an understanding of celebrity Chef branding, the recent Buffet upgrades at Wynn, Cosmopolitan and Caesar's seemingly a better value with superior service, though certain items and the chance to sample several of Buddy V's Signatures without investing in a full lunch or dinner seems worth it for fans or those looking for a family-friendly alternative to Grand Lux Cafe while staying at the Venetian",

I must say, the food is absolutely incredible and the guest service was even better. It was our first time here so we ended up getting lost in the Venetian and arrived 15 mins late to our reservation. The hostess checked us in and actually sat us right away. We had 2 servers - both were wonderful. Our strawberry lemonade drinks were never once empty. It felt like we ordered bottomless lemonade. Our main entre arrived quickly (probably between 10-15 mins). Nonna's lasagna and the Chicken Parm tasted heavenly. After the main entre, the server recommended a variety of desserts. We chose the cheesecake. It was delicious and the portion size was huge. I'm glad my boyfriend and I shared. By the end of the night, our server brought us two glasses with the inscription \"Buddy V's Ristorante\". He said it was to remember our night at the restaurant. We both had the best experience here and we cannot wait to come back. Probably Valentine's Day :) I wish I was able to remember all of their names for proper acknowledgement but we want to thank the whole staff for making our anniversary dinner so special. We absolutely love this place.",

Honestly, while it wasn't terrible or anything, it wasn't as great as it looked or as tasty as I thought it would be.  To top it off, service was \"meh\" and my reservation requests were totally ignored.  I requested a booth by a window but did not get that.  (It was busy for lunch though and almost every table was occupied.)  I also noted that we were celebrating a birthday but not even a simple birthday greeting was given.  Totally disappointing.  I wasn't crazy either about how close the tables were to each other.  One good thing at least was that our water glasses never went empty?  Also, the Caesar salad that came with my sandwich had warm, soft croutons which added a different but interesting taste to it.  Glad I could check this place off my \"to try\" list, but after that experience there really wasn't anything to make me want to come back here again.",

    "text": "While I still think dinner is a solid three, their Sunday brunch buffet is five stars all the way!   I really don't like traditional breakfast food, and Buddy V's Sunday brunch had two egg dishes and one French toast dish at the buffet. Perfect!   The buffet is divided into five stations: starters (charcuterie, shrimp, antipasto, soup, Caesar salad); carving station (props to the bacon and the spicy Italian sausage); Kids corner (Mac n cheese, pizza, candy); entrees (loved the meatballs, chicken Parmesan, carbonara Mac n cheese) and DESSERTS! Delicious tiramisu in mason jars, cannoli, and zonuts were my favorite.   The buffet is $34.95. I opted for the extra all-you-can-drink mimosa deal for $14.95 and you can choose from mimosa, Bellini, sangria, beer or wine. The Bellini was tasty but that sangria tho! I'm embarrassed to say how many glasses I had.   My fiance got the Bloody Mary deal for $18.95 in which they bring the vodka and you craft your own Bloody Mary from a different station. He had fun doing that (and adding shrimp from the appetizer station) and he also got to choose from all my drinks. He ended up switching to the sangria as well and drank as much as I did. He got to keep his glass as a souvenir.   We got seated right away with no wait (even during March Madness weekend) and I can't wait to come back. Wish it was served every day!",

    "text": "A revisit here did not quite replicate our earlier 5-star experience.  The restaurant was not as accommodating as before, and did not honor our reservation request for a booth.  Instead we were seated at a table where one-half of my party of four was temporarily blinded by the sun near sundown.  Then we settled in, and things soon improved.  Grandma's Meatballs covered in Red Sauce (Sunday Gravy) were authentic classic Italian meatballs, and Aunt Nina's Mozzarella en Carozza was a hot and cheesy confection once again.  Calamari Fritti was another nice starter.  And the complimentary Focaccia Bread was great.  A big side of Caesar Salad was good.  And Nonna's Lasagna Al Forno was again one of the best lasagnas I have ever tasted--besides Diane's vaunted cheesy and saucy concoction which won the 2014 Ardiente Lasagna Baking Championship in a blind tasting by judges.  This time I did not even bother to finish the whole rich lasagna dish.  I filled up on half of what was presented to me, and took the other half home.  Alas, Diane failed to persuade the chef to make her Veal Parm Alfredo, and had to settle for a good Veal Marsala instead, which unfortunately arrived late to the table.  For dessert we were served great Cannoli compliments of the chef, to make up for the late arrival of Diane's dinner entree.  Service was excellent except for the ordering miscue, no peppers offered on the side of the Calamari Fritti, and no available Roasted Potatoes this particular evening.  4-1/2 stars overall!",

Our waiter was the most amazing person, he was very attentive, personable, and charming, and made the experience here the amazing experience it was. The style of the restaurant is very charming and cute as well, and the environment was perfect for a night now while still being relaxing and comfortable. The proportions on the food were well worth the money too, I ordered chicken parmesan, which came with two huge pieces of chicken. The three other people in my party ordered other chicken, and every single one of us had to take home more than half our meal. Would highoy recommend to anyone looking for a good meal, this was the best we had on our Vegas trip!",

Bestie and I were in a major hurry to catch our flight but had a hankering (and a reservation!) for Italian before we left Vegas.The hostesses were incredibly accommodating and let our server know we had a tight timeline.  As a result, we sat, ordered and ate - including dessert to go - and drinks in a mere 30 minutes! Clearly a dining world record.  Our server Kristin had impeccable recommendations. We started off with the caprese salad and then had lasagna and spaghetti and meatballs for our entrees. The pasta was cooked al dente as it should be. Everything was piping hot, fresh and flavorful. After the complimentary bread and breadsticks, there was no way we could eat all that food. Portions are this side of ginormous.  The manager Adam came by to check on us and chatted about other Vegas restaurants we had been to even offering future menu suggestions for a steakhouse we had been to the night before. He clearly runs a tight ship while making sure guests are well taken care of and well fed.  Will definitely be adding Buddy V's to my list of Vegas faves!",

Spaghetti and meatballs were home-made tasting, in my book that means you can taste the True tomato flavor and it is not overwhelmed by the many spices normally found in spaghetti sauces. 5 medium size meatballs complement the pasta in a heavenly smelling and tasting treat. Garlic bread was buttery, crispy, garlicky, and substantial. Calamari crispy, peppery, with lots of tentacles. This is how calamari should be.  Wait staff amazing, in my book. I had technical questions about the tomato sauce, as in how their Bolognese is prepared. Suffice it to say, it tasted great...not too infused with basil and oregano. Polite and courteous, all staff were pleasant and kind.  The breadsticks were wrapped in separate packages. Just ask for more if you want more. Real grissini torinesi, as they are long and thin, with a hint of olive oil taste.  As good as it gets now...if you've read my reviews, I only give 5 stars to any place only after it has consistently shown, after many visits, that their quality and commitment never wavers.",

You know how sometimes you want to get an appetizer but it might be too big for 2 people so you don't get it?  No problem!  We were lucky enough to have gone during happy hour and didn't realize that they had specials during that time.  Because of happy hour we were able to try several appetizers in smaller portions so we could enjoy and taste a few things.  We had the calamari, Grandma's meatballs.  For salads were tried the cesar and mozzarella caprese.  They have homemade croutons in their salads that are unbelievable.  All were delicious.  In addition we had Italian sangria for $4 a glass.  Try and top that in Vegas folks!  For dinner we had the shrimp scampi and cheese ravioli.  Everything was excellent.  We were saying how we wish Buddy would open one of these restaurants in our area because we would be regular customers.  We'll be back Buddy -- thanks again!!!",

Save your self some money and just make the huge line for his bakery and don't waste your time and money at the restaurant. Line is about 20 minutes long.

For this visit, Kristina, the restaurant manager, could not have been any nicer. She accommodated us with a great table where our stroller could fit (we were traveling with a 3 year old and 2 month old) and checked in with us multiple times throughout the meal, including engaging in playful banter with our son. At the end of the meal, she gave him a light up cup that made his night. In a tourist-laden city where the service often slacks, Kristina did an exceptional job. I couldn't recommend buddy v any more if you are looking for a reasonably priced and family friendly Italian restaurant on the strip.",

The restaurant is spacious and nicely decorated. He had the $22 Express Lunch (he chose meatballs, chicken parm and a cannoli) and I chose the Caesar salad with grilled shrimp (included these amazing polenta croutons!). Everything was tasty and the portion sizes were filling and just right for lunch. The service was extremely friendly and attentive from the servers, hostess, busboy, etc. We look forward to visiting Buddy V's again next time we're in town and would recommend it for anyone looking for a casual, low-key, fair priced and tasty meal.",

Definitely recommend the calamari fritti (something similar to that spelling) it is the option hat is breaded and comes with green peppers and lemon aoli. It was fabulous and perfectly cooked.   We also shared the veal Marsala.  The noodles and the actual marsala sauce on the veal were VERY good.  Thumbs up!   Their canolis looked amazing but we were too full to get any.

Ordered Grilled Octopus; broth was spicy and tasted good.  The problem was the rest.  Actual octopus was fine; only thing was, there was only one bite and rest was filled by greens and potatoes!  Then ordered Shrimp Scampi for main course.  It was with angle hair pasta which was fine.  Taste was fine.  Here again, there were only 4 medium size shrimps with tails on to make them look bigger than actually they were!  I understand this is Vegas and understand this was inside of a casino; but, by no means one gets his/hers money's worth.  There are many other Italian places in the same casino that serve great Italian food and one gets close to reasonable amount for his/her money!",

The chicken parm that everyone raved  about tasted like something from Olive Garden but no seasoning and the Spaghetti on the side came cold no flavor .

I ordered something simple: spaghetti and meatballs. It was very...ordinary. As in \"I've had better at my junior high school cafeteria.\" Absolutely nothing to praise about the dish. I make better at home. So does the wife. So does Chef Boyardee, for that matter.  The wife ordered the veal parmesan. It was a huge hunk of meat, on the bone, pounded way too thin and then burnt under the cheese. The cook obviously put it on too high a heat and forgot it for a bit. Totally inedible.  For a place opened by a \"cake boss,\" you'd think the desserts would be exemplary. Guess again. The rum birthday cake was so-so, and the cannelloni were stale and flavorless. Again, worthless food served in a nice room with good service.  Save your money and taste buds and go anywhere else for dinner. Maggiano's is just down the block and light years better tasting. Heck, go to Battista's. It's a dive that's over-rated and still better than Buddy V's. Or just stay home, heat a can of Chef Boyardee and eat it while tearing up $20 bills. In the end it's the same experience.",

    "text": "They did a nice job renovating the former First Food space. It feels more homey and approachable. The interior may skew towards an over-the-top, typical Italian restaurant  with red and white checkered tablecloths and a panoply of picture frames, but there are cool touches like the light fixtures and use of rolling pins throughout. The place doesn't reinvent the cuisine, but executes traditional Italian-American dishes with a few subtle modern touches to create one of the better Italian restaurants on the Strip.  The eggplant parm app has plenty of great flavor, but could have benefitted from a crispier exterior. The dough of the aggnolotti was a touch thick, but the crispy texture from being pan fried was a nice touch. The sweetness of the sauce with the savoriness o the pork filling was great. The winner of the night was the huge brick sized portion of lasagna that arrived in a small cast iron dish. The mixture of proteins along with the boldness of the ricotta made for a wonderful combination that was only enhanced by the depth of a red sauce that any Italian grandmother would be proud of. For little ones, there's a kid's menu available. Among the items was a large order of buttered noodles that my kid loved. No meal is complete without dessert, and the nutella cake was a satisfying way to end it. It's their version of a lava cake with a rich, moist cake enveloping a gooey nutella mixture. A scoop of salted caramel ice cream accompanied it with a brittle underneath that added a good contrast in texture.  The execution was solid and the dishes different enough from your typical Italian American joint to make Buddy V's a good choice among moderately priced restaurants on the Strip.",

BAMM best of both worlds.  wrong not all the deserts are available at the restaurant, BUT there are some good ones on the desert menu.  the bathroom isn't in the restaurant, it's actually down the hall from the bakery across the hall, seems inconvenient but there wasn't a line any of the two times I went.   Of course we had to try a canoli and of course we were not disappointed!  overall great restaurant with even better deserts.",

    "text": "We stumbled upon Buddy V's looking on Yelp for an Italian dinner while in Vegas.  We lucked out that it was restaurant week too, so we were able to try quite the variety of options.  The restaurant is located in the front of the Venetian, so overlooks the strip making for a nice view at night.  We started out with the cheesy garlic bread, which was huge and quite good.  We also had the meatballs, which were very flavorful and the red sauce was delicious.  For dinner, the other half had the chicken parmesan, which he loved. I had the linguini vongole, which is my go to usually, and I thought it was fresh and well flavored, and not overly oily (my sometimes complaint).  We finished with a plate of all of their desserts, and every single one was good.  I think the cannoli may have been my favorite.  I did not realize until know that this is the Cake Boss' restaurant, but now that I know that, I think he should be the Boss of an Italian dinner too.",

    "text": "We had a reservation there a few weeks ago and were seated right away.  Service was attentive -at first. We got our drinks, went straight to the entree. After that, our server wasn't very present. The chicken Marsala was pretty good; however, the pasta carbonara was very rich. My friend ordered it and I felt overwhelmed after two bites. Dessert was wonderful -we got the lobster tail and it was decadent. Great flavor and texture. The pit of night was when our waitress, Kacey, dropped the bill and told us the gratuity was already added so all we had to do was pay the total noted at the bottom.    The problem there was that we were a party of 3. We looked at the bill and printed directly on there was something along the lines of: \"No gratuity has been added to your bill. For your convenience, here are some preset gratuity amounts, just circle the one you'd like to apply. - 15% - 18% - 20% - 22%\"  Kacey had circled the 20% option and wrote the new total at the bottom because I guess she thought that that was what she deserved. After she dropped the bill, we noticed she was constantly circling our table, waiting for us to provide a method of payment. We were a party of 3 and even though we are young (early 20s) we know how to tip. It was pretty insulting. I get it, you work in the heart of Vegas where many international visitors aren't aware of the customs. But that doesn't mean assume everybody is like that. After talking it over amongst ourselves, I got her attention and pointed out what the receipt stated and said that if it says that, then the gratuity amount should really be up to our discretion. She tried to cover it all up by saying something like, \"Oh, that was just a suggested amount, if it's that big of a deal I can just take it off.\" And she ripped off the bottom of the check.    I've worked in the restaurant industry and servers face heavy disciplinary action for that type of behavior. We still left a tip but the whole ordeal really just left a bad taste in our mouths.",

    "text": "Buddy V's Ristorante is located within The Venetian hotel. My best friends parents treated us out to lunch here on a Saturday. It wasn't too crowded and I wasn't sure what to expect. We were seated promptly given we had a reservation for 10. After looking at the menu a few of us decided to get a few different items and eat family style.   // FOOD // Margherita Pizza: sliced tomatoes, basil, fresh mozzarella. Simple and light. It's a medium sized crust, not crispy or too doughy. I really enjoyed this one with a little grated parmesan and crushed red pepper. 4.5/5  Buddy's Favorite Pizza:  spiced sausage, caramelized onions, fennel, four cheese. I didn't care for this one too much. The sausage and the blend of cheese didn't go well together. I would definitely go with the margherita pizza instead. 2.5/5  Spaghetti Central with Meatballs: Your basic and simple spaghetti with five meatballs. It was simple, but I thoroughly enjoyed the tomato sauce. I thought it had excellent flavor. I would definitely order this again and maybe try it with the bolognese next time. 4/5  Chicken Parm: Provolone, mozzarella, spaghetti marinara. This dish was excellent for sharing. It would have been too heavy if one person just got it, but it was great for our group. They give two chicken breasts with a decent portion of spaghetti on the side. The chicken parm was deliciously cheesy! 4/5  Overall, I was extremely pleased with the service and food at Buddy V's Ristorante. I will definitely be back for more of that tomato sauce goodness. The only thing that can possibly make this place any better is if they served you some fresh break with oil and balsamic in the beginning. Just saying...   ENJOY!",

Really? I had to send the $7.00 side of capellini back because they forgot to put any garlic in it.  My wine (Super Tuscan) was very good but I don't appreciate drinking a $16.00 glass of wine out of a cheap ass wine glass. Have you heard of crystal wine glasses?

Everything came out at the same time (bravo!) and we had wine chilling next to the head of the table.  The chicken parm was just like home and was so good after trying it someone else had to have it as well and changed their order. Definitely one of the best things on the menu. There's a great deal where for a set price you get an app, soup/salad, meal and dessert: WORTH IT. I enjoyed my carbonara pasta: SO much flavor.   You could take home leftovers, but you'll just eat them at 4am without regret and it'll still taste good!",

WARNING the portions very large! One of the meals could have filled my husband and I but we were piggies and had to try more LOL! First my husband is Italian and VERY picky about his sauce and this fit his criteria for good sauce. The chicken was fresh and the breading was light but crisp. The the lasagna was outstanding I can't say enough about it. The filling was cheesy, there was meat but not too much, and the sauce was fantastic. We ended the meal with a cannoli that was very well done. Usually the ricotta is too gritty for my taste and this was creamy with just enough sweetness. We seriously can't say enough good things about this meal! If you get the chance to come it is a must. Our only regret is that we couldn't eat more!   My husband would like to add that his ONLY complaint is that the chairs felt cheep.",

This restaurant is located right in the Venetian hotel right across from Carlos's bakery. The restaurant was dimly lit inside. It's a great restaurant that has an amazing view of the north side of the strip. You just have to request it when making a reservation. It wasn't too crowded and for Vegas it is truly affordable! The dishes run between $15-30. They give you just the right amount. It's definitely not a family style Italian restaurant so I suggest not sharing. I had the chicken rigatoni which I made spicy and omgosh it was so good that I had every last bite and wanted to lick my plate up haha. It was amazing and this is definitely a winner in my book!",

Had a team lunch here on a Friday and they do have a nice lunch special where $22 get you one of the three selected app/salad, an entree, and a small dessert (tiramisu or cannoli).  I opted for the regular menu, lasagna, and a regular sized tiramisu.  As we were having lunch, we noticed our neighboring tables all got the 'birthday cake' for dessert so we also added that to our order.  It was good, but the tiramisu was still more delicious to me.  The waiter that attended to us seem to be in the weeds...  Overall, the food is decent but was a tad bit pricey for what it is worth.",

The restaurant wasn't full, and we were sat in the back in sort of a sad, empty room. Our waiter was nice, and recommended the Lasagna for us, which we ended up sharing. The Lasagna was delicious: it comes baked in this amazing pan and is literally covered with cheese. It was more than enough for my friend and I to share. We also tried the Garlic bread (delicious, but kind of like Texas toast Garlic Bread at the grocery store) and the Caesar salad, which was actually gross.  It was over-salty and had these terrible, sweet croutons that tasted awful with the salad. I took two bits and was done. How do you destroy a Caesar salad? With sweet croutons, that's how. Overall, we were glad we ate there on the account of the Lasagna being so delicious (It is a bit spicy, which made it even yummier), but the back room atmosphere could have been better and less like a neighborhood Applebee's.",

    "text": "When I was booking the Palazzo as the hotel for NYE 2016 I noticed they offered a $25 dining credit for Buddy V's. As I was choosing from several options the Buddy V's credit sealed the deal as I can always fall back on this restaurant to serve delicious \"homemade\" comfort Italian food. With this I convinced my family to dine here for dinner.  Dinner is a different beast from lunch. With lunch the No1DP and I are able to have a pretty quiet meal with plenty of natural sunlight. There's also not much activity going on in the middle of the day. Come dinner, especially on the day before NYE, the place was swamped and the tables were loud. There were also plenty of people in line to get a table or in line for the nearby Carlo bakery.  The 3-course pre-theater menu ($38/person) was a hit with everyone in my family. It made ordering a lot easier and since I was covering the dinner tab, along with the $25 credit made a Vegas dinner more reasonably-priced (but still expensive for regular casual Italian). What made it particularly appealing for me was that the menu options included my favorites: Grandma's Meatballs, My Dad's Bucatini Carbonara and Lisa's Warm Nutella Cake. These were the standout dishes I stated in previous reviews and I was very happy I could have all my favorites in one sitting. This was a lot of food - I remember eating cold bucatini carbonara the next day for breakfast (which BTW is still very good if you don't mind eating it cold).  In summary I've enjoyed both lunch and dinner at Buddy V's though the situations that I'll recommend both are different. I'll recommend doing small plates for lunch as the portion sizes are more manageable if you want to save your appetite for a big and fancy dinner. This is currently the arrangement for the No1DP and I whenever we're in Vegas. I'll recommend dinner as a non-date or casual date option if all a party wants is just some good comfort Italian food.  LUNCH: 4/5. DINNER: 4.5/5.",

Boss' Express Lunch for $22 got us an antipasto, main entree and dessert. For a starter, Grandma's meatballs were tender and sat in a bed of tomato ragu. The much anticipated chicken parm was a little on the dry side but nothing a little more sauce could've helped with. It was just the right amount of food. My heavy lunch was offset by the refreshing lemon sorbet with biscotti. Very strong lemon flavor, it was good! I would also suggest the Panzanella - i tried a few bites and it was a really great salad if you're looking for something lighter to start your meal with.  Fun touches related to baking and family incorporated into the decor. Ceiling lightbulbs encased in mixer whisks, rolling pin structures and at home pictures on the brick walls. Big restaurant and comfortable, family vibe. Huge fan of Buddy's show Cake Boss. Was hoping to catch him but maybe next time!",

We had the Cesar salad, pepperoni pizza, spaghetti and meatballs, and bread with olive oil and butter. The bread and salads came out first and we couldn't get enough, they were so good! We ordered more bread even though we had pizza and pasta coming. The pizza was crispy and the flavors really popped, and the spaghetti and meatballs were perfection. We had a table where we could see the strip out the window, which was very pleasant and surprisingly serene. Our waiter was truly Italian and a riot. He made our dining experience even more enjoyable.   I definitely recommend Buddies and make sure to check out his bakery across the way!!!",

We ordered the shrimp scampi which was made with a tomato base sauce and caesar salad.  The croutons were very different...they were served arm with cheese filled inside of these huge croutons.  It was very delicious!!  The breadsticks in packages in a holder on the table were also delicious.  We wished we stayed for the lobster dessert, but we were too filled.   We will be back the next time we're in Vegas visiting.",

We mentioned to the server and she explained to us we are here at lunch and bread is make in AM so it is older. The \"FRESH BREAD\" IS FOR DINNER\". Yikes~ We understood we have to ask for it at lunch but honestly, dry/stale bread? ok, so even gets better. I ordered a Stella, took 15 minutes to reach me. ONLY ASKED AFTER desert arrived is I'd like another Stella? WHAT???? keep the alcohol coming. Its Vegas. 12 minutes for desert. They had to make it fresh...We were laughing that perhaps the staff was in the long bakery line outside the restaurant. Food was good/fair, SERVICE HORRIBLE. Your staff is going to kill your business and should not be tolerated. Our bill was wrong. you name it. and....the best of all--our friend ordered spaghetti/meatballs. He opted for sausage instead. So, he was $6 for CRUMBLED SAUSAGE? WHAT? We discussed with waitress and she was defensive telling him \"i distinctly told you it was crumbles\" Well, she did not tell him $6 for crumbles. Whole sausage are only available at DINNER? Not cool at all. His family needs to get over there and educated their staff or this place will FALL! I will NOT be back. We ate appx 3pm so not too off for dinner. Very disappointing experience :(",

Although the treats at the bakery were amazing we were extremely disappointed by how we were treated by one of the male wait staff at the restaurant. We are in our mid twenties and I feel like he didn't respect us as customers. We ordered a few cocktails as well as the cheeseboard. It was not a pleasant experience and I don't know if you will see this but I think everyone should be treated fairly dining at the restaurant (also the opening time on the website is wrong). That part of our trip was ruined. I love the show and am a huge fan.",

    "text": "My wife and I decided to drop in Saturday night to see if we can get a table without a reservation.  Unfortunately they were booked for the night, but the hostess asked if we'd like to sit at a high top at the bar.  Since they offered the full menu we readily agreed.  Within minutes of sitting down we had waters and our waitress greeted us.  The service was great and she happily gave recommendations.  We started with the calamari and it was excellent, the fried anahiem peppers were a great counterpoint to the calamari, which was cooked excellently.  I ordered  the chicken parm and my wife had the chicken picata.  My chicken parm was delicious!  It was two chicken breasts fried to perfection topped with mozeralla and a side of spaghetti with marinara.  I'm very picky about my marinara, I can't  stand when it's sweet, and this was done really well.  Very savory and went perfect with the chicken.  My wife's picata was cooked wonderfully as well but was lacking in the citrus.  She asked for a plate of lemons and was able to season to get desire.  We finished off the meal with a lobster tail dessert.  The pastry was beautifully done, the cream rich and smooth, and the berries tasted very fresh.    All in all it was a great meal, my only gripe was the decor / ambiance.  It was like they couldnt figure out what they wanted to be.  The decor was that of a nice italian restaurant, low lighting and dark wood.  But their menus looked so cheesy like something from Farrels and the busers all wore bright red shirts but the hostesses wore little black dresses.  They need to go either elegant or cheesy, either would be fine but straddling the line is kinda weird.",

Well when the salad came I raised concerns and was told another salad is coming without meat.. but after ten minutes and rest of my party already had their salad finished; my salad never came. Later the manager came asking the same questions and promising another salad; to which I told him no since I didn't want start on salad while my party is on their main entree'. I was hoping the food would be good, but no.. The pasta was not fully cooked, hard to chew, dry and only 3 shrimps!!! For a $30 entree' I was expecting some good.  But no!

Great deal -- $4 wine/proseco/sangria and $5 appetizers.  We enjoyed the calamari, meatballs, and mac n cheese (it was delicious).  Headed to the front desk at 6 pm for our dinner reservation and they assigned us a table right outside the open kitchen hub.  When I requested something quieter?  She walked me back to the bar area!  First I was a little annoyed -- why did I make a reservation if I'm still in the bar?  But turns out it was for the best, a quiet window table in the bar area with a view of the strip.  Perfect.  We were able to order another round of happy hour drinks and their pre-theater menu for $38 pp!  Opting for light choices, we had the tomato soup, salmon, and cannoli.  Salmon was cooked perfectly and the cannoli was a perfect ending.  Both servers in the bar were EXCELLENT, friendly, and attentive.  Sadly, our only disappointment was the quality of the happy hour drinks.  The chardonnay was very dry, which is great for some people, but the big issue was the sulfites in the wines.  Really didn't enjoy the chardonnay or the proseco.  Otherwise, lovely restaurant with good food and great service!",

I could care less thinking it was just a cash in on the cake boss thing. I was wrong. This place is legit.  Food was great, service was pretty good, and prices not really bad if you compare them to other joints on the strip. I paid almost $20 for a terrible cheeseburger at the TI. I paid $24 for some of the most amazing chicken parmesan at Buddy Vs. I know which I'll be going back for next time.  We started with the salumi and cheese board. Everything on the board tasted great. You really get a lot. We had a party of six and didn't eat all of it. I loved the pickled peppers that came with it.  I had the chicken parmesan. Crispy breaded chicken with delicious marinara sauce covered in gooey cheese. So freaking good! It came with a side of spaghetti which I don't normally care for (don't shoot me), but theirs was really good. I just couldn't eat it all, and I'm a big guy.  My wife had the chicken piccata. It was a big portion and delicious. Also served with pasta.  We both loved this place and will most definitely be back! Next time we'll try to save some room for that awesome looking Nutella cake.",

However the line was kind of long and we decided just to have an early dinner at Buddy V's cross the hall and get the deserts at the restaurant.  The hostess was courteous and the waitress was very nice. We ordered Calamari appetizer, clam linguini and mac & cheese. Linguini was al dente and kids liked the mac & cheese. But the deserts were the reason we stopped by. We ordered cannoli and lobster tail. Sure they did not disappoint, the cannoli's filling was fresh and crust was crispy. The lobster tail's skin was crunch and filling goes very well with the fresh fruits.  The price was the average Las Vegas casino meal price and the overall it was pretty good dining experience.",

We got an amazing window booth that over looked the strip and could see the gondolas below - it was not too loud and had a great vibe.   Our waiter Chaz - was amazing!

They had only been open about 10 days or so when my friends and I went so I did take that into consideration when writing this review.  Upon entering the restaurant I felt that the decor was quite nice.  They have framed family photos all around the walls which gives it a \"homey\" feel.  Even though some of the prices may be creeping close to fine dining prices the cuisine is not fine dining (which I like btw).  The whole table had the Jersey City style fried Mozzarella, margarita pizza, chicken parm, warm nutella cake, and XL lobster tail dessert.  I really enjoyed the fried mozzarella as it was not breaded like traditional fried mozzarella but rather sandwiched between two prices of bread.  The pizza is nothing special to me and did not stand out compared to the same style of pizza at other restaurants.  The chicken parm was a good portion which came with pasta that really did taste homemade.  My friends thought the Lisa's warm nutella cake was the best dessert they have had in their lives!  The service was spoty and our waiter would be gone for long periods of time but the busboy always made sure we had what we needed.  I chalk that up just to being a new restaurant.",

Georgio, out server ... Hats off to you. Thank you for providing is a welcoming and phenomenal dining experience. And Alex ... A busboy ... Another wow in our books!! Nicely done gentlemen!",

I had the \"Sunday Gravy\" which is a variety of things - sausage, meatballs, lamb, etc. served with pasta and red sauce. Great dish and very filling. Dining companion enjoyed her chicken parm. Pricing is reasonable for the strip, but obviously you can get cheaper Italian food in a locals restaurant. Service was good. I'll be back.",

On top of that I mentioned that is was a special occasion as I booked and they never made any mention of it or brought out dessert for us. Service was awful, food was almost too salty to eat and way overpriced for the quality. I was extremely disappointed and embarrassed for taking my fiance here on our special day.

The server was courteous but rushed she paid us little attention and it took forever to place an order, to get a dessert menu, and get the bill.  We definitely did not feel like Famiglia:(  Sorry, Buddy, this place needs LOTS of customer service training.  Food: Meh, the lasagne was forgettable, my wife liked the Sunday Gravy OK...

The meat was perfect.  A lot of crumbled beef on the sauasage.   Excellent.    Would have been 5 stars with better service.  It seems to be a common theme in Vegas, mediocre service at the restaurants.  I think we asked for coffee 7-8 times before being served.  Just not very attentive and no sense of urgency.    5 star food and 3 star service gets you 4 stars.",

The portion size was perfect and the pasta was very delicious! For dessert I got the italian donuts which were also delicious! My favorite was the strawberry one, but the chocolate was a close second! Our server was awesome too, he was very attentive and we never went too long without seeing him.

The selection was smaller than a typical strip Buffet, but everything I ate was high quality and tasty, unlike a lot of dishes on a typical Buffet. The shrimp cocktail we're huge and plentiful, the meat and cheese selection was awesome and the crepes with berries were excellent. The dessert table allows you to try many versions of Buddy's pastries, my favorites were  zeppole(zonuts), the cannoli and the Italian cookies. I was so impressed with this brunch, that the following month when my mother and Aunt came to town, I brought them there as a treat. On my second visit I did the Bloody Mary bar, which was excellent and I was pleased to learn that I could choose from other alcoholic drinks as part of my $15 all you can drink price. I also tried the Bellini and the sangria and both were excellent. I will be bringing many people to this brunch when they come to town. $35 for a Strip brunch of this quality is very reasonable.",

Slow service from the wait staff, arrogant manager on-duty, and one-drink-at-a-time bartender make this restaurant experience drop a couple of stars. The positives are a very nice greeter, fast kitchen and casual Italian ambience. Skip the basics, don't get the spaghetti or lasagna al forno because they are not much better than local joints. It's expensive for what it is, so you might as well go for the good stuff. Try the veal or chicken parm, veal Marsala, and the bar. I'll try it again and hope it gets better.",

So we decided to go the next day for their weekend bunch. It was a bit pricey $34.95 including drinks. Our server was nice and very attentive. Selection was not that many but it is a good food. The tomato basil soup was superb. Their apple sausage was tasty. I like how they have a small portions for kids meal too. I was able to get  Reese chocolate. I was a big fan of sweets so dessert is big deal for me. They have red velvet cake and bread pudding not to sweet but it was good.",

The guy just hands over the drinks menu after around 5 minutes he took our order. I want to confront the guy but the wife says to just let go.  Food was nothing of extraordinary.  Waiter was pleasant, updated us often on our orders and made small conversations here and there- including telling us \"Buddy is in the Philippines at that time to personally open his two stores there.\"  But I had the feeling of being rushed just so they could sit another party. It was only 4pm and there was no people waiting when we left around 4:30pm.  One last annoying thing was the SUGGESTED TIPPING- minimum is 18%! My wife and I are most of the time very generous with tipping (usually 20%) bec of the fact that waiters are not paid well and rely on tips. But out of the goodness of my heart (ha! lol), tipped him 18%.  Their DISHONESTY about the you-keep-the-glass strawberry lemonades and feeling of being rushed make me give then 2.5 stars!

For large groups, they have a convenient ordering process. Once seated, they will bring a menu developed around personalized choices (even gluten free variations for the table, food allergies included) to the point where the items are plated separately from main courses.  Salads, followed appetizers, followed by man courses and then finally deserts! I love the little Coca Cola bottles they bring so you're not craning for a team member to refill your glasses! Thanks for making our team dinner so seamless and a classy experience!  The management here is extremely efficient and pleasant to communicate with!!!",

Worst of all, the croutons in the Cesar salad were soft polenta squares, not crunchy as we hoped. Wanted to like this place so bad!",

First I started with a caesar salad. The lettuce was fresh and the dressing was good, however instead of traditional croutons they have these polenta croutons which are soft and squishy with the consistency of soft tofu. These bad croutons ruined the salad. They had no flavor and did not provide the contrast in texture croutons provide in a caesar salad.   For my main course I ordered chicken parm. They provides 2 nice sized chicken filets but again they tasted pretty bland. It was served with an incredibly tiny side of pasta and red sauce. The sauce was bad I have had better jared sauce before. It had so much fresh basil that it was overpowering. Also it was insanely sweet and had no acid balance. I would have expected better from someone who comes from New Jersey.   For desert I got the Italian birthday cake and that at least was great. Super rich and moist and was the only good part of the meal.   The \"cake boss\" should stick to desert and leave the cooking to a real chef.",

What i didn't expect was the sloppy service, our server seemed to be having a bad day and it just felt like he wanted us to leave. I wasn't offered bread and he was ready to bring the check when i had to interrupt him and ask if he would be so kind as to bring us a Dessert Menu.  In the end we let it slide because we were in a good mood and wanted to enjoy ourselves.  Cheers!",

We started with the calamari and it was ok, the fresh bread was very good. I had the veal parm and it was excellent. Everyone else's meals were good. One of us had the Steak Pizzaiola with polenta, however, the polenta was a bit soggy the eggplant was enjoyed by another and the Branzino was DOA and sent back. The wines by the glass were a little pricey, but good for the brand. All in all a pleasant night",

    "text": "Had dinner with a family and friends group of 12 last night and our overall experience was mediocre at best; awful at worst. The food was very bland Italian with little seasoning or flair. And for the price the combo of modest portions of mediocre food coupled with elevated pricing was totally unacceptable. Beyond that, problems included 1) the noise level which made socialization difficult, at best (it would be great if you have absolutely no interest in table conversation), and 2) the ruthless attempts at upselling our group a \"family style\" dinner at $55 per person, excluding beverages. When we repeatedly asked what the dinner would include we received no more than vague responses. We were told there would be an appetizer offering, salad offering, entrees, desserts, etc. But when we asked for specifics as to what the courses would be there was no satisfactory response. There were vague references to pasta, meatballs, etc. and that the meal would a \"surprise\" from the chef. But, no detail was provided despite repeated questioning about either the offerings or the quantities.The upselling efforts actually extended to ignoring requests for menus until I flatly demanded that our server provide them, which he finally did. And we then ordered from the menu. Our waiter, obviously miffed that we'd shut down his upselling efforts, became a phantom and any needs were met by food runners and a bussing assistant who was efficient and reasonably attentive.  Our final tab, including tip, came to around $475 which was roughly $180 less than the tab would have been had we bought into the \"pot luck\" chef's surprise \"family style\" dinner than was ruthlessly pushed. And it's worth noting that our final tab also included not only the food we wanted, but also roughly $90 of alcoholic beverages which would not have been included in the upselling effort. So, despite all the previously mentioned deficiencies we at least escaped a financial scalping.  In short: We are Las Vegas locals, we did NOT have a good experience, we will not return and we will definitely never recommend the restaurant to anyone. Las Vegas locals, and all who come to Las Vegas, deserve better....better food, and a better customer service/dining experience.",

Here's why: even though it's Vegas and even though the food was delicious the service was so so and even for Vegas was supremely overpriced. The server was pushy and overly aggressive trying to up sell and honestly came off as a little misogynistic. Normally we have no problem but wine when out at a restaurant knowing full well you are paying for 2-4 times what it cost to purchase at the store. This restaurant almost forces you to purchase a bottle since it offers essentially one option of each wine to purchase by the glass. It's an Italian freaking restaurant! It should have many options to purchase by the glass or bottle and I'm sorry but selling the Meiomi Chardonnay as the only Chardonnay option for $14 a glass when I can buy an entire bottle for less than that ($12) is just crazy.. there's markup and then there's nuts. To put it plainly you are paying to eat at the famous Buddy V's \"Cake Boss\" restaurant since you can pay a better price for the same quality if not better food at other Italian restaurants such as Lavo or Trevi.

We thought this was just going to be a touristy spot with mediocre food off the Vegas strip... and we were delightfully mistaken. The food was actually great. The calamari was fantastic, and the Salmon was terrific. Our server and bus boy were all super friendly and very fast accommodating us. The prices weren't terribly expensive either, so overall it was a surprisingly great experience! Others have mentioned to make a reservation, and I'd recommend that! I think we got lucky to be able to walk in. Either way, great place to eat if you're nearby!",

    "text": "As a Las Vegas local, I try to avoid the strip restaurants as much as possible.  They're usually over priced, and over crowded, but when I found myself at the Venetian with my wife and daughter, we swung into Buddy V's on a whim for lunch.    My wife and I are typically appalled by kids menus because everything tends to be fried, or bathed in cheese; Buddy V's was no exception.  With that said, I ordered the kids chicken parm, however I requested the dish be with a grilled chicken breast, and no cheese. Our waitress gladly made the change, and my daughter loved the food. $12.00 for a kids meal is a little pricy, but it is the strip after all, and the food was a big hit with my daughter. I don't mind paying for quality.  The lunch menu is a little small, and I was wishing I'd looked at it before getting a table, I figured I'd just grab something with little expectation.  Big mistake! I ordered the adult chicken parm, and my wife had the chicken blt.  The pasta with the chicken parm was slightly al dente, and perfectly cooked. The chicken breading was crunchy with juicy chicken inside.   My wife was a big fan of the thin piece of chicken that came on her sandwich, and the perfectly toasted bread.  The basil was fresh and tomato not mushy, another big hit.  I would have given a higher rating of not for the poor service.  Our waitress, Bethany, disappeared from our table for 20+ minutes. She took our order, and didn't come back until it we'd been finished eating for quite some time.  All in all, we'd come back for the food but the service needs some work. Out total bill was $57.62.",

The hostess asked if we wanted to sit in their patio and we agreed but once there we quickly changed our minds. We found ourselves sitting out in the pathways of those coming in and out of the Venetian Canal Shoppes. We asked if we could be moved over to the bar and this was no problem. There was plenty of seating in the bar area and this is were we stayed and made it just in time for happy hour. They have some food items as well as alcoholic beverages for $5 and ends around 630 pm. I ordered a Caesar salad and the Eggplant Parmesan and my friend ordered chicken Parmesan and carbonara from the menu. Our app was calamari. It was all delicious and plentiful. So filling in fact that we had enough to take home. The True delight was in the tiramisu which came in a little mason jar. That alone would make me return. The bartenders were wonderful and definitely sold us on our meals. We really enjoyed the service as well as the food.",

    "text": "\"I think good things happen to good people.\" Buddy Valastro  A good thing happened to my wife and I. We were driving down Las Vegas Boulevard and were trying to decide where we wanted to eat lunch.  Heart Attack Grill ? Been there, done that. Please see review. Carson Kitchen ? Been there, done. Please see review. Lagasse's Stadium? Been there, done that as well. Please see review.  Lola's Louisiana Kitchen? Rock N Noodles? Grimaldi's Pizzeria?   Been... there... done... that... Please... See... Review.  Long story short, we found Buddy V's Ristorante and we enjoyed it a lot! I ate a Hoboken Cheesesteak. I love cheesesteak, but have never been to Hoboken. I'm not really sure what Hoboken would taste like? But the sandwich was delicious.  My wife ate a Chicken BLT and said her's was delicious as well.  Service was spectacular. Our server, Danny was one of the best we have had along Las Vegas Boulevard. If you don't believe me please see my review for Mon Abi Gabi.   The bill was under $40.00! But then again that was without alcohol. That's right it is possible to eat on Las Vegas Boulevard and not consume alcohol!  I have two concerns about Buddy V's Ristorante. One, the bakery across the hallway is over the top and smells addicting. Two, there is a kid's menu, but I have a feeling, Buddy V's Ristorante would not be good for kids in the later hours of the day. Lunch or early dinner, sure.   Great Place. Great Service. In closing I would like to suggest reading my review for Buddy V's Ristorante... but you just did.",

Very bread-like, not your typical starchy pasta. The taste was forgettable.  The wife thought the mac&cheese carbonara just tasted like bacon, but the other two at our table thought it was great (maybe they just like bacon lol). And the sliders were pretty normal. Nothing to write home about.  I found it weird that the happy hour specials were only available in the lounge. Maybe that's normal in Las Vegas/America but it caught us off guard.",

Tried the Buddy's Salumi & Cheese Board (olives, pickled vegetables, grilled Italian bread, genoa salami, spicy capicola, proscuitto di parma, grana padano, tuscan pecorino, and gorgonzola).  The capicola and proscuitto were the best I've ever had and the gorgonzola was epic - bleu cheese flavor with the texture of brie.  Cheeseburger at an Italian restaurant?  You bet because the Pat Lafrieda Burger (brioche bun, tomato aioli, provolone cheese, tuscan fries) was really tasty.  The tiramisu was the best I've had anywhere.  Ask for a table bordering the outside perimeter windows for great views of The Strip.  Bring your camera to take pictures of the incredible entree cakes Buddy and his team made.",

Skipped Appetizer and Salad since we didnt want to risk getting too full for dessert. Chicken was the perfect amount of Piccata. Dessert was the star of the night with the \"Italian Birthday Cake\". I consider this the perfect dessert. Beautifully presented on a signature chocolate signed plate and pedestal. The perfect balance of not too sweet and not too rich layers of rum soaked sponge cake and cream filling. Coffee was good too.   Skip Maggianos Little Italy across the street and go to Buddy V's Instead. Far better quality and flavor.",

Further, told the busboy that we had a show to catch and could he please tell the server we had to move fast.  Within 2 minutes, server appears to take our order to ensure that we could make our show.  Excellent!  Food:   Garlic Bread:  Good Buddy's Caprese:  Very Good Chicken Rigatoni \"Alla Vodka\" :  Very Good Valastro Sunday Gravy:  I did not try, but my friend claims it was Excellent.  In fact, he insists I write this in here because he wants to encourage others to eat it.  (He insists that others dip the Garlic Bread into the \"Gravy\".)  We had a bottle of Chianti and it was very good, as well.  Great service, great food and would definitely go again.  So thankful, they were so accommodating to our tight schedule!",

Adjacent to the Cake Boss bakery you will find the restaurant. The decor makes you feel like you are in Buddy's family kitchen with a trendy twist. First off, we were impressed with our servers knowledge of the restaurant, the beginning including how it all started, how it's grown, and Buddy's role in all of it. He seemed to really love working there and his passion for the company was inspiring. The menu is full of Italian comfort food dishes. A surprising twist to the evening was the lemon croutons on the salads, we ordered a side of them to indulge ourselves throughout dinner. The dessert menu is adorable, it looks like an old family photo album complete with pictures and the history of each recipe used. The personal touches Buddy and his family have put into this restaurant truly make you feel as if you were invited into his personal home. We are so thankful we stumbled upon this gem, and look forward to visiting again on our next trip to Vegas.  If you are a Buddy fan, this place is a MUST!",

So while at the bar I seen they have a signature The Cake Boss Martini and let me tell you it was best martini I have had in a long time!

    "text": "Came here for Sunday Brunch. Expectations were low.The last brunch I had was at Yardbird, and if you read my review on that, you may understand why.   Buddy V's offers about 25 food items, and 10 dessert items for a $35 price tag. They also offer a selection of unlimited alcoholic beverages for another $15.  They also have a limited al la carte menu that offers pretty much everything that is already on the buffet, but why would you pay $23 for just chicken parm?  Here we go...  As we walked in, the aroma of GARLIC just punches you in the face!   My! How quickly expectations can change.   We were warmly greeted buy 2 pretty hostesses, and immediately sat at a table. I couldn't wait to look around. Our server greeted us, and went over the workings of the Sunday Brunch. We also got the unlimited alcoholic beverage option.  My lovely wife got sangria, I started with a domestic beer, then went a red wine. Sangria was great, and so was the vino. We stuck with that for most of the meal.   As a foodie, I have to say ALL the food offered was FANTASTIC. If you like Italian comfort food, this brunch will satisfy all your needs, and make you eat way too much.   I ate so much, I did not eat again till the following day.   The italian sausage on the carving station (see pic) was luscious. The fritatta delish, orecchiette pasta amazing, the french toast unlike anything I've had before. Chicken parm was tasty. They put fried polenta croutons in that amazing fresh, cold, caesar salad. Meatballs were nice. My wife loved the ham on the carving station.   EVERYTHING was so good, so good, so good.   I visited the dessert station and discovered a totally different Tiramisu than what  I'm used to. This one was done with love. It was light, wet, and beautiful. The bread pudding and red velvet cake changed my mind about not liking bread pudding and red velvet cake. Hey, the cake boss apparently ain't no joke. These desserts were great. I can't wait to go back to try the Italian wedding cake.  I thought I was done after dessert, but went back to get more of that sausage and meatballs. With a little garlic bread of course. Also had a bloody caesar that was very good also.   Did I mention how good everything was? Man! this place is my new Sunday after church brunch spot!  I've been to buffets on the strip that offer 3 times as much of a selection for about the same price. You know what though? No one could possibly try that much food. Even if you could, not EVERYTHING would be fantastic. The other thing I dislike about buffets is that the food is almost NEVER hot.   Buddy V's Sunday brunch offers a smaller selection of fantastic HOT, FRESH food in a buffet style setting.   The food is so good, that when you float out of there on a euphoric foodie coma trip the last thing you think about is the price. A total value experience.",

Upon arriving at 10pm for a table of five, we were greeted with \"Is everyone here?\" ..Yes, we reply. 'Ok - they're setting it up\".....5-10 minutes later we ask what is going on and we're told \"It'll be 5-10 minutes\" not remembering what they said earlier.  We get to a table by the window and it's too breezy with the vents so we ask to be moved.  She says she can clean off the table next to us and we can move there.    The waiter comes by later and says that's nonsense because that table JUST ORDERED!  So we ask again.  This time we're told we have table 38 in the corner...they just have to set it up (again).  We wait patiently.  When our group sees another group of five moving to table 38, it stuns me.  They of course get seated and I have to ask for the manager.    She promptly comes by and asks all sorts of questions - and in the end comes back with \"Sorry for the confusion.  It's been really busy\".  REALLY?  ROCKET SCIENCE?  I think not.  With so many choices in Vegas, we will be going elsewhere from now on...don't need to be treated with incompetence from hostess to managerial level.  Good luck Buddy.  We even passed on dessert.  A shame really.....  **** UPDATE NOTE ****   Management did contact us directly and seemed truly concerned about the experience.  Very nice to know that they do care about what went on that evening.",

Buddy V is also known as Cake Boss. Across the way you'll see his other store, which always has a long line. We made a reservation because we went at 5pm. I would recommend making a reservation to ensure you are seated quickly. Within minutes the place was packed for dinner. They also have  great happy hours specials I would recommend checking out.",

So, if you are okay with or need to impress someone by spending about double what you would normally pay for a good, but rather run-of-the-mill and somewhat small portioned Italian meal, then you will likely be satisfied with your experience here.  Otherwise, you'll probably feel like what I felt afterwards. No longer hungry, but not particularly impressed.  We had the panzanella, turkey dinner, linguine and clams, cannolis and apple crostata. The panzanella was good, but we wished there was more than the four small slices of cheese on it. The turkey dinner was good. Was it $24 good? Not so sure. The linguine and clams was somewhat overpowering with the spices. Is linguine and clams supposed to make you sweat? Apple crostata was pretty darn tasty. Easily the highlight of our meal. The cannolis? Seeing as how the cannolis are seemingly a signature type thing, you'd think they would wow. They didn't wow us. They're good cannolis for a Hoboken bakery. But for a $$$ restaurant in the Venetian? For $$$ it needs to be BETTER than \"home cooking\".",

It was pretty quiet, not too many people around which was nice, I didn't feel like competing or waiting for a table.  I really loved the decor, it was decorated like a nice italian kitchen; I thought the rolling pins that decorate one of the walls was a cute and creative idea. There were family pictures on the walls that gave it that homey feel, and I have to say I really appreciated that the restaurant was spacious, so it didn't seem cluttered.  My friend and I ordered Aunt Nina's Mozzerella en Carozza, which was fried mozzerella with crotini in a tomato sauce.....OMG!! So Freakin good!!!! We were tempted to order another one, but decided to wait till we had tried the rest of the food we ordered.   We also order the linguine in white clam sauce that was also pretty good, it had lots of clams yummy!  For dessert, we got a lobster tail and a cheesecake. The lobster tail was too f*ckin good!!! We were in heaven, the flaky pastry filled with fresh custard cream and fresh berries, it was perfect balance! Not too sweet, not too tart, the berries complimented the pastry perfectly.  Needless to say after that we were stuffed, so we had to take the cheesecake to go.  This place is a must for Cake Boss fans!",

    "text": "After spending most of the day in the sportsbook, I was ready to chow down and my belly was craving some Italian food. Upon check in at the Palazzo, my wife and I were handed a coupon book to select restaurants, bars, etc. inside of the Venetian and Palazzo. This included a coupon for Buddy V.'s. So we decided give this place a shot when we saw that this place had opened recently and had received four stars on Yelp.   We started off on the light side of things with a Caesar salad. There was nothing particularly great about this salad except for the croutons. I'm not really a crouton fan because they tend to be too bland, salty and/or crunchy.  Normally I would pass over them completely. After my wife urged me multiple times and after I had refused multiple times, I saw my wife's fork with a crouton on the end of it right smack in front of my mouth. I succumbed to peer pressure and tasted what was probably one of the best croutons ever. The crouton had a crunchy exterior and then evolved to a smooth and creamy interior with a terrific garlic flavor inside. It was so delicious that I had to fight my wife for the rest.  Looking back, she probably regrets shoving that crouton in my mouth.   I ordered the Nonna's Lasagna Al Forno which was served in an incredibly hot iron skillet. I think the cheese was still bubbling a little bit when they brought it out to our table. This was probably one of the thickest lasagnas I have eaten in a long time. This lasagna came with generous portions of fresh Italian sausage and ground beef and layered with ricotta, mozzarella and provolone cheeses. The marinara sauce was a perfect blend of sweetness and spiciness and had settled to mostly the sides of the lasagna. The top was sprinkled with a tiny amount of Italian parsley. This was one of the best lasagnas I have had in a long time. Each bite melted in my mouth. There was no doubt I was going to finish dish.  Because of the reviews, tips, and photos of meatballs on Yelp, my wife had to go with the meatball spaghetti. Needless to say, she polished off the dish easily and said it was one of the best meatball spaghettis she had tasted. The meatballs at Buddy V.'s inspired her to go home and cook some meatballs herself. I think that in itself should speak volumes about their meatballs.  We had just enough room at the end to split their Tiramisu which was equally as delicious as our entrees. It was a nice touch to include a side of lady fingers in order to swipe any remaining coffee flavored cream at the end with them.  The service here was top notch. Our waitress was fully knowledgeable about the menu and was ready to offer suggestions. She was great from start to finish!   Even with the coupon, I agree with the other reviewers that say this restaurant is on the pricey side.",

The food here is ok and service is great. If the Carlos Bakery line across from here is crazy, you might as well eat here and order bakery items for dessert.  I like how they have \"healthier' options here. The portions are perfect - which means, if you're starving or have hug appetite, you'll be hungry if you eat just 1 entree.  ***DINNER***  Roasted Sea Bass: Branzino with cured lemon, arugula salad and pine nuts.This was just ok. 3/5  Italian Greens: Tuscan kale, plum tomatoes in garlic oil. Tasty but a little too oily. 2/5  Caramelized Sea Scallops: Perfectly seared scallops with crispy prosciutto, parmesan polenta in tomato vinaigrette. 3.5/5  Seared Salmon: Crisp salmon with charred broccolini, pickled vegetables in balsamic reduction. 4/5  ***BUFFET BRUNCH*** Muffins, croissants, pan au chocolat, bacon, ham, sausage, scrambled eggs, French toast, crepes, nutella, jams/preserves, mascarpone, chicken parmesan, meatballs, orochiette with sausage, mac n cheese, salad, veggie frittata, garlic bread, tiramisu, cannoli, bread pudding, zeppole, red velvet cake, cookies, etc.  It's a pretty good spread. Definitely get the French toast, meatballs, mac n cheese and veggie frittata. I drizzled Nutella on my French toast....mmmmm...however, I don't think I got my $35 worth.",

The salad was a bit on the salty side for us, but it got compensated by the Tiramisu.  Do recommend and make reservations. We didn't and had to side outside, which isn't too bad, but sitting in would definitely have been much much better!  It is on the pricey side as expected from a restaurant located in Venetian.",

    "text": "Our first trip to Vegas and we selected this as our finale meal. We had good food at a variety of places in Vegas, but this was certainly the best. As a table of four (or more) we had the family style option, a fixed price, multi course meal. It was spectacular. Our server, Georgio, was the perfect combination of attentive and conversational, while knowing when to allow us time to chat and digest between courses. Family style dishes are determined by the chef. First course was panzanella (Italian bread salad), fried calamari (accented with thin sliced fried lemon!), grandma's meatballs, and a charcuterie board. Each item was prepared perfectly. We had a very nice Chardonnay with this course. If the meal had ended there we all would have been wonderfully satisfied with our meal. After letting that settle a bit, out came the entrees: a perfectly cooked beef tenderloin on a bed of mashed potatoes, a gargantuan portion of lasagna, tender chicken medallions in Marsala sauce, and a beautifully prepared sea bass. With the entrees we had Pinot noir. There was no room in our bodies for another morsel of food, but we cheered each other on to eat a bit of each of the desserts: a miniature Italian wedding cake (in honor of our brother and sister in law that were celebrating their 25th anniversary), chocolate cake with coffe gelato, and a conical, cream filled pastry called a lobster tail.  A meal of a lifetime, with impeccable service. If your budget allows, definitely make Buddy Vs a priority stop in Vegas.",

The bread they bring out is delicious and melts in your mouth. The Caesar salad had the most amazing, what we initially thought were croutons, melt in your mouth cornbread-ish squares. The main entrees were plated beautiful and tasted delicious!  Our daughter got chicken parm off the kids menu and it was the same serving size but no dessert or salad for $12.  We got a sangria carafe for $24 and it was very good and it had a lot of fruit...but not so much alcohol which was ok with me. Service was super friendly, but a little slow.  All in all we were so glad that we stopped in.",

I ordered the scallops which was 5 pieces with prosciutto. The scallops are too seasoned in the rosemary flavor, which threw me off. I'm not a fan of rosemary so it was too much for me. I had to swap dishes with my boyfriend. He had the sea bass which was not bad; crispy on skin and flavor was a bit salty but decent. We had cheesy bread to start off too and it was too filling to finish with our entrees. Our wine was good and the we had a side of broccoli that had a kick of spice to it. It was my birthday too, so they gave us a cannoli with happy birthday written in chocolate. It was complimentary which was nice. It wasn't that great for it to be $114 (without tips). Reminds me a lot of Bucca too except that it's not made for family style. I want to return to try their lobster tail dessert, since i heard good things.",

They serve fairly decent sized portions. I ordered the chicken parmigiana, which was very good. I sort have expected when I ordered garlic bread that it would be knots and not just bread covered in cheese, garlic and herbs. It was served with the main course, which was kind of pointless, I would have liked to get the garlic bread before the main course. Anyway, the place was definitely solid, decent price, I would recommend it and I would return if I want good Italian food next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "Was in Las Vegas for a conference and always try to stay at the Palazzo.  It is a very nice hotel with lots of restaurant choices.  One of my favorites is Buddy V's.  They have great traditional Italian food that is simply prepared with the best ingredients.  The flavors and quality of the food for the price is pretty incredible for anywhere, but especially in Las Vegas.  One of my favorite dishes is the Bucatini Carbonara.  It literally calls my name sometimes.  The best carbonara I have ever eaten is in Austin, TX at a place called La Traviata, but I digress.  Buddy V's Bucatini Carbonara is pretty amazing.  It has just the right mixture of flavors and with the richness of the sauce is just amazing.  I have to confess I was a little high maintenance and asked for a flat pasta (linguine).   My dinner Caesar salad was large, but as Caesar salad go, pretty uninspired.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but it wasn't up to the level of the pasta dish.  The wine list was reasonable (for Las Vegas) with several good selections by the glass.  Since I was dining alone, a bottle seemed an overindulgence.  If you are anywhere near the Palazzo, Buddy V's is a must.  You need to eat this food.  The one star deduct is for the just average Caesar salad.  Everything else was great.",

    "text": "So this is going to be a bit of a longer review covering so much.   Ambiance: This restaurant has an incredible energy! I love the display kitchen. So you will see everything being made and exiting the kitchen, if you are near the kitchen.   Food: Honestly this menu is one of the best menus. It offers everything from pasta, pizzas, burgers, and everything in between. The quality is incredible too! The chefs have an incredible sense of what flavors go together.   Service:  The initial welcome from the host was incredible! She greeted me and inquired about anything that I am celebrating. She then very politely showed us to the table. Now my waitress was a different story. She greeted us nicely at the beginning. However she made us feel very rushed! Like the restaurant was not busy, why are you rushing us? Like her first question wasn't for drinks but rather food we want. Then when we ordered drinks we never got refills on our water until our food came out. Once we finished the main entree, she was quick to try to give us the check until she remembered we are celebrating a birthday. Overall I'm disappointed in the service.   I still give this 4 stars because it was a great restaurant but had a few bad staff members. Overall I would return but I hope I receive better service next time.",

    "text": "Buddy V's restaurant was good but not great, which was disappointing. The service and setting was excellent and notable. I found everyone from the hostess to waitstaff to be courteous and helpful. The restaurant specializes in classic Italian-American fare like lasagna, chicken parm, and cannolis.   The lasagna, Caesar salad, house salad, and cannoli were all delicious and a highlight of our visit. The chicken parm, unfortunately, was disappointing. There was barely any marinara sauce present and the chicken was not soft and succulent like I've come to expect from excellent Italian-American joints in the New York area.   Overall there is clearly a strong vision coming from Buddy Valastro's family home cooking, but I assume there is some miss in the execution. The restaurant is good and I would recommend if in the area, but it was not a standout.",

I got the Cesar Salad (amazing), Carbonara (so comforting).. my friends got the chicken parm, which was also very good, and then we got tiramisu for dessert.

So,  they have like a 40 dollar meal combo where you can get an appetizer, entree,  and a dessert and my sister and my mom were planning on getting that but our waiter suggested doing the 60.00 meals where it's all family style and you can all share. So,  they decided to do that.  However,  when we got out bill they charged by sister for scallops separately when that was supposed to be part of the menu and they also charged me for 2 other desserts when we never ordered those desserts and they gave it to me cause it was my bday but I never ordered it.  They did refund the desserts but that was about it. Like I said the food was good and the waiter was nice for the most part just I don't suggest doing the all you can eat unless you're a big family.",

Our only disappointment was the waiter tried to upsell us on the wine.

I've watched Buddy on T.V. and have been impressed with his portrayed personality anyways.  So when we saw the restaurant we decided to try it.  All of the tables with the view of the strip were taken so we decided to sit at the bar where my husband could watch the hockey game that was about to start.  Christian was our bartender.  She greeted us promptly, set us up with waters, offered suggestions, had a vast knowledge of the foods and drinks and patiently waited for us to make up our minds. They offer a decent selection of bourbons and whiskeys.  My husband loves a good old fashion.  Not only was Christian accomplished in making one she recommended the Elijah Craig and took it to another level.  She muddled the fruit and then strained it off which he always appreciates. Comes over square ice, nice presentation with orange rind and not one, not two, but 3 luxardo cherries.  We got there in time for happy hour, which ends at 6:30 or 7 p.m.   I had the sangria for $5.  You can't beat it.  Probably 1/2 cup of fresh fruit at the bottom.  It was refreshing and the wine was actually a decent one, which isn't always the case for sangrias.  There was another bartender working, Matthew.  They worked flawlessly together.  No one's drink without ice or is left with an unfilled glass.  Usually  you get the attention of 'your' server but here, they are attentive and make you feel like family.  Speaking of which, Matthew recently became the proud Pappa of a preemie which he is still visiting daily at the hospital.  Prayers for speedy growth and discharge home.  Thanks to these two our stay was wonderful and the food was completely overshadowed.  But allow me to address it.  We had the meatball sliders.  I found good.  My husband found wonderful.  The macaroni and cheese was very good.  And we had the lobster tail dessert.  Crispy croissant cooked perfectly with a french creme in the middle.  This is wonderful!  Don't forget afterwards to walk across to Carlo's and get some of their ..",

    "text": "The food was just ok. We expected a lot more for the price and hype.   Only thing that really stood out was the appetizers: meatballs and tomato soup. Very fresh and well seasons. But it's $13 for 3 meatballs so I would really not expect anything short of amazing at that price point.   As for the pasta, nothing exciting about the flavors or presentation. The ravioli dish looked messy and rushed. Reminds me of Chef Boyardee canned raviolis (except bigger) that when you microwave them the sauce splatters everywhere on the plate.   As for dessert, we shared a cannoli. That was good but seemed a bit soft on the shell. Not sure if it was pre-made so it was starting to get soggy or just a softer shell recipe but not the crunchy cannoli I was expecting.   We live close to Vegas and go every few months. We will probably not got go here again. I prefer Gordon Ramsay's Fish and Chips, and so does my debit card.",

We have now gone to Buddy's twice now for the Thanksgiving meal.   We love the food. They have a version for kids or they can order from the kids menu. Note: you can order from the menu if you don't want the chefs menu.   The desserts are to die for. We had the pumpkin cheese cake.  The kids had Chocolate cake and Nutella ice cream",

So my sister and I decided to take her and her best friend here to celebrate her 65th.  I'm always down for trying new places and venturing out.  Let me just say this place did NOT disappoint!!   Oh my goodness!!!   We sat in the bar area so we had a view.  Our bartender/server was Danny and he was amazing!!!  He made us a pitcher of sangria and it was ridiculously good.  We ordered lots of small plates/ appetizers so we could try different things.  The calamari was the best I've ever had outside of Maui.  My moms friend doesn't even like calamari and she loved it.  The caprese salad was hands down the best EVER!!!  The eggplant was incredible.....   I could go on and on but I honestly cannot say one  bad thing about this place.    The service,  the food,  the ambiance....  it exceeded every single expectation!!!  I cannot wait to go back!!!  Absolutely incredible!!!    It was awesome to celebrate my moms birthday with the most amazing meal possible!  Thanks Danny,  you rocked!",

It was too good to the point where the margherita pizza seemed so bland. I had to take the pizza home but it was perfect for the late midnight snack. The tomato basil soup was a little bit on the salty side but wasn't terrible. The mac n cheese was also very delicious! The bread crumbs made a great combination with the mac n cheese. Overall, the service and food was amazing. I would definitely come back more often.",

It took us forever to find the restaurant. It's not well signed. When we got there a nice lady took us to our table. We waited quite awhile to be noticed. Finally a snoody server came over. He tried to upsell us bottled water. We declined. Of course I didn't order the burger. Instead I had the smashed meatball sandwich. It came on a crisp french roll. It also had ricotta cheese on it. That just ruined it for me. The meatballs were dry and very little sauce. All I could taste was the ricotta. It came with french fries that were nothing spectacular. My friend had the vodka rigatoni. He said it was very good. It should have been for $23.00!! That was the lunch price. I think this place is over priced and to snoody for me. I would have much rather gone across the street to Mangiano's. I never have a bad meal there. No, I won't be back and won't recommend it.",

    "text": "AMAZING DINNER! I went to Buddy V's with my family and was a bit nervous at first. I love the show and have been dying to try this restaurant since Buddy announced he was opening it. It was probably one of the best Italian meals I have had in a long time, the meatballs were amazing, great portion size and lots of flavour. The caesar salad was also good, very garlicky which I like. Next was the mains, we got a few but the most memorable were the shrimp pasta and the spaghetti and meatballs. Both had tons of flavour and great portion sizes. We were celebrating my 25th birthday and all I wanted was to try something at Carlos Bakery. The manager was incredible, he went across to the bakery and got me a cupcake because he knew how much I wanted to try it and the line was crazy. For dessert, we also had the apple pie, this was the only item we ordered I was not crazy about. It came out like a hard cookie shell and it was nothing to write home about. The waiter was very annoying, he kept trying to push us to order things and he didn't take no for an answer until we said it more firmly. However, overall, it was a great meal. The manager Adam was very nice and seemed to really enjoy his job. He was all about customer service and customer satisfaction.  My only recommendation is people who dine at the restaurant should also be able to go to the bakery.",

    "text": "Never in my life have I had such a bad experience as the one I had yesterday at this restaurant!  While waiting for friends to stand in the 2 hour line at Carlo's Bakery, I decided to wait at the bar and have a Happy Hour drink special.  I sat at one of the bar tables and was happy that there were only two other customers having drinks. I waited and waited and watched as the waitresses appeared to be setting up for happy hour. The bartender looked busy as he helped the two customers sitting at the bar. After almost 20 minutes I walked to the bar and told the guy I was waiting patiently and he apologized so asked for a sangria and he walked away.  He didn't bother to help me but instead started taking orders from the customers who were starting to pour in. WTF? Finally one of the waitresses asked me what I wanted and i ordered my drink after telling her that i was being ignored.  She failed to acknowledge me. I went back to sit on one of the sofas and finished my drInk and finally after another 20 minutes they finally came around so i could order again.  I was even more perturbed because the customers who came in way after me were already on their third drinks! A few minutes later i saw the waitress with a tray of sangrias assuming one was mine but it was for the people next to me!  She claims she accidentally forgot my drink!  I dont like people playing the race card and never in my life have i ever felt so small and insignificant but thats how they made me feel.  I was the only hispanic in the place. Big deal if my one and only drink was free. The manager Adam Margolies Who claimed to be Buddy's cousin, offered a free $4 drink!  I will never go to an establishment that treats anyone the way i was treated.  Terrible service. No one despite who they are should be singled out.",

    "text": "Please Save Your Money Wife and I had dinner there on Friday night. Overall the entire experience was very very disappointing. The value for the dollar was not good.  We had 2 drinks, 2 Apps, the caprase tomato's, laughable small  no taste at all. The potion size was the smallest I ever saw. The price was high even for the strip and it was tasteless. Wife had the tomato basil soup. Was only avg.  I had had the spaghetti bolognese and wife had the regular red sauce. I don't know how Buddy can call himself Italian but the bolognese  sauce was totally tasteless. red sauce was just avg.  Our male waiter upset us big time. Coming to Vegas 4 times a year I am or so I thought well schooled at efforts to run up the bill however.. We ordered drinks, apps etc and he says, oh do you want garlic bread at the table? Thinking it was an opening (welcome) dipping sauce and bread like most Italian restaurants, we say sure. Well us and the table next to us made the same exact mistake. It comes and it is actually $13. charge. We both looked over and said, we just got taken! Shame on Buddy V's for this type of tactic to its guests. BEWARE.. Also, FYI, tables are very close to each other, private conversation is impossible. We heard everything the table next to us said and they were not loud at all.  You need to understand that the value for the dollar you pay is NOT there..  Buddy V should just stick to what he does best, bake!! The open kitchen quickly reviled that there wasn't an Italian in the entire kitchen as it shows in the taste!  There are much better choices on the strip. This is just another celeb chef guy trying to capitalize on the name. If people stop going to these places to eat they will go out of business or start getting it right.  For the life of me I cant figure out why there are positive reviews unless these are being gamed intentualy.  By the way, a manager never came around to even ask us or the other table how everything was. Just another sign! We will never go back.",

Its always nice to walk around the Venetian, but the location of this restaurant is quite strange to me, I thought it would be at the heart of Venetian.                                         But anyway I've heard of this place through a client of mine who went to the grand opening, I watch cake boss on tv all the time and I've been curious about this place so I had to check it out for myself.So the wait time for our table on a Saturday night was only 15 minutes, our waiter was great and the amazing client service we got was from our busboy Jamal. He was very attentive,efficient, and he just paid attention to everything. He should definitely get a promotion and a raise! Ok so now the review of the food. We started with a charred octopus (recommended by our waiter)as appetizer and it was seriously delicious, I love squid so this was perfect. For our drinks we got the brooklyn ipa and prosecco which went perfect with everything we ordered.For entree we ordered Eggplant Parmesan with marinara pasta, Meatball Spaghetti and Garlic Bread on the side. Everything was so delicious. The garlic bread was a meal by itself. The portions here are huge, so you better go here with a huge appetite.And lastly we got the lobster tail and this was the cherry on top it was light,airy, and yummy! I'm very excited that the cake boss opened a restaurant in sin city! Now I don't have to drool all the time while watching him make amazing pastries on tv, I can just stop by Buddy V's ristorante instead! I will definitely go back because the experience and service I got was excellent.",

When we were to be seated, the hostess tried to sit us right opposite the open kitchen, which is brightly lit, noisy, steamy and certainly not where we wanted to be. She then went back to see where else we sit and we got a table for 2 in the bar. The food was good. Foccacia was warm and they offered oil and vinegar as well as butter. We found the service was fast, maybe a bit too fast.  Maybe Saturday night is a busy one,and they try to move their diners along. We had the beef medallion, $38, cooked a little too rare for medium, but it was tasty. The mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach that it was placed on, could have been a bit more generous. Very skimpy on those portions. We also had the price fixed dinner for $38, which gave you choices. We had: Grandma's meatballs, chicken parm with spaghetti and they were tasty but they skimped on the sauce so although it was good, it could have been better. The chicken parm was very crispy and tender but the spaghetti was a bit dry. The meatballs had a nice portion of sauce served with them, so we should have kept that dish, just for the leftover sauce. The desserts you could choose was a cannoli or a Nutella cake with salted carmel ice cream.  Nah...didn't appeal to us, but we were told you couldn't substitute from that menu.  Really?  I can understand the entrees but the desserts? We were told that they had a 'full dessert menu' but our waitress never offered to show it to us. Carlo's Bakery is right across the hall from the restaurant, but by the time our meal was done, so were we. There was quite a long line waiting to get into the bakery, and it wasn't moving very quickly.  What we did notice, was that when you go to sit at the bar, there are 2 steps up, and there is no handrail in the middle of this wide expanse. We saw two patrons stumble, and one of the waiters actually took a flat out fall. We may go back to give Buddy V's another try and since we now know the lay of the land, so to speak, we will be specific about where we want to be seated, and will order with a request for \"additional sauce on the side\". I'm from Jersey City NJ originally, so come on, Buddy, take a little constructive criticism to heart, from a neighbor who loves ya'!  :-)",

    "text": "Just returned from Vegas. Had reservations for 5pm before seeing Rock Of Ages Show.  Went personally at noon to confirm reservations, as the two ladies in our party of four were celebrating birthdays, and wanted to make sure we would get window seats.  The original reservations were made at the same time room reservations were made by the pallazo hotel.  We were told we would be given window seats. Well the hostess said she could not guarantee, but made a note of the request as well as the birthday celebration. We arrived at 4:45pm fifteen minutes early, and found an almost empty restaurant.  As luck would have it, the original hostess was there.  She said she would be able to seat us \"near\" a window table.  I laughed and said, well it looks as though you have lots of tables.....her comment was to go sit in the lounge \"bar\" area until our reservation time.  Trying to sell drinks I suppose.  We sat there , not ordering drinks, and she started to seat us away from the window....again I reminded her, and miraculously she found a table.. It dawned on me later (after my wife explained) she was fishing for a tip to \"find a table\" Anyway, we ordered.   The Lasagna came, large portion, lots of cheese and meat, little skimpy on the sauce.  Wife had Chicken Parmesan which was overcooked and little sauce.  The other couples order consisted of a new York steak which she raved about, but her husband had steak and lobster, and said the steak he had was tough, but the lobster was good.   Table service was good, lots of flat bread, water refills. Oh....if you happen to like a nice fruity White Zinfandel (the fastest growing wine category in the US) you will not get it there.. They don't carry one,  I know some restaurants are a bit snobbish because its a \"blend\"    So regarding the birthdays?  Well most restaurants will make an effort to do something to acknowledge a celebration.... Desert came and went, nothing...  Anyway, I know they have not been open for very long.  Our waiter was good, food runners ok...The Floor manager spent his time looking from a distance, but made no contact with the customers.    Place looks nice, food ok, price ok....but Buddy......you need to instill a little passion in your place...Your gonna have to step it up to compete with the upscale establisments located in the same building.",

Great flavor and healthy portion size. I haven't been this pleasantly surprised by a meal in a long time. 2 thumbs way up to buddy v's",

Both were very tasty and average sized, not huge but not small either.   The decor is very authentic Italian, and has a homestyle kitchen vibe.

If anyone is going there get the lasagna you will think you have died and gone to heaven.   For dessert we had the lobster claw with cream and berries again outstanding and enough for two people to share.  They also let you reserve on line.   I would suggest that you take full advantage of that.  Some days are harder to get into the restaurant than others.  And online reservation makes it more convenient.    I would also suggest that you don't go home with out visiting Carlos Bakery which is located just across from the restaurant   I am going there again very soon and they also have a Happy Hour menu with lots of specials especially for all the locals.",

The bread was wet and mushy.  The greens had way too much dressing.  The good news: the tomatoes and cucumbers in the salad were delicious.    My husband got the Sicilian charred octopus. He said the octopus was nice.  The problem is, with so many outstanding restaurants close by, \"nice\" just doesn't make the grade.    Sorry Buddy!",

    "text": "Wow, not sure where to begin because there were so many amazing aspects to our buffet brunch! Part of the reason we decided to check out this spot was because of the amazing drink special. We were sold on the $14.95 for bottomless drinks, thinking that the food would be a run of the mill Vegas buffet. Our group of 9 ended up arriving pretty late to our reservation due to traffic and the navigation of the hotel. Our waiter, Charlie, couldn't have been more understanding and cool about it. When we ordered our drinks, we found out that with the special you could switch your drink at anytime. Because of that, our boy Charlie was generous with keeping a mixture of carafes on the table, and kept them flowing! Once we actually got started on the buffet.... Wow. Everything was DELICIOUS. I highly recommend the Mac and Cheese (it was on my plate every single time!)  Overall for the price of the buffet/drinks and the actual quality of the food, this place is a steal! I cannot wait to come back the next time I'm in Vegas. I also hope to have Charlie as a waiter again, because his helpful and sweet attitude really just enhanced the entire experience!",

    "text": "Before we get to food or ambiance, first you have to find the place - which is buried in the maze of the Venetian / Palazzo Canal Shops.  I have been to the real Venice many times and I swear it is easier to find your way around there than it is around the Canal Shops.  At least the real Venice has guidebooks with maps.  It would be helpful if Buddy V's website would at least give a clue, like saying \"We are on the second floor, about 30 yards down a hallway from Barney's New York, and overlooking the porte cochere facing the Strip.\"  Would that be so hard?  So, anyway, after a few wrong turns and roaming around for 10 minutes I'm a little grumpy but we find the restaurant.  My first impression is that someone crossed a mob restaurant from Jersey with a Chuck-E-Cheese.  Very bright.  Very loud.  Very crowded.  Lots of kids.  Hard chairs at the tables, although the booths looked comfortable.  (The booths were all full at 6:00 p.m. on a Wednesday.  Whatever criticisms I have about this place, they sure don't seem to be keeping the customers away.)  The wait staff was attentive.  Drinks came quickly (I needed one), along with a piece of foccacia bread and some olive oil and vinegar for dipping.  We were here for restaurant week, which meant ordering off of the prix fixe menu.  I started with Grandma's Meatballs; they were not the best I've had.  They had a kind of a light, mousse consistency and not much (if any?) sauce.  Well, I've never understood the iconography of \"Grandma\" as the pinnacle of  the culinary arts anyway.  Personally, I'm more impressed by training at the Culinary Institute of America and a few years working in a Michellin starred restaurant, but hey - maybe your Grandma was a better cook than mine.  My entree was the roasted sea bass, and that was a very nice piece of fish.  I also had a side of Mac & Cheese Carbonara, which was excellent,  My wife had a Cesar Salad and a pasta entree, and she enjoyed them both very much.  For dessert we each tried the cannoli, which was kind of mediocre.  That surprised me, since Buddy V is known, first and foremost, as  baker.  The $40 prix fixe menu was a good bargain, although the prices on the main menu were definitely creeping into the \"fine dining\" range.  Oh, it's not Sinatra or Giada's by a couple of hundred dollars, but it wasn't priced as a family restaurant either, even though it felt more like a family restaurant.  So, time for the trek back to the parking lot.  At least we didn't get lost this time, and the Venetian is one of the few Strip hotels that still provides free parking - hat tip to Sheldon Adelson for that.",

With so many excellent choices in the Vegas culinary field, it's critical to place the upmost importance on customer service if your intention is to remain relevant, not just a mere tourist destination. As always, the food was delicious, atmosphere beautiful and location perfect. However, the customer service has significantly declined. Our waiter was inattentive, bothered by our request to split the check for a party of eight, less than fourth coming with the cost of a birthday treat for our daughter's 16th celebration, incorrectly calculated our ticket (hopefully in error) and expressed his exasperation in an evident and unappreciated fashion. Sadly, I think we will be forced to expand our Italian palate.....",

She had the cheese ravioli and I had the chicken Parmesan with spaghetti. The flavor that burst inside your mouth never stopped. We were pretty much smiling throughout the entire meal. Me beer was cold. Both beers. And the garlic bread appetizer with marinara was the perfect prelude to the entire meal. The service was really nice. We felt comfortably serviced. The environment with the background music selection made you feel like you were at home eating your grandmamas cooking. And they were staffed properly. All very important things to look for. I would put the pricing star to a level three though. Won't be back for awhile but let me say that if you are in Vegas and are looking for some killer fare Buddy V's is a must have. By yourself or with somebody else. DO IT",

Grandma's Meatballs: beef, veal, and pork. Good flavor and easily shared but you wont want to.   Free Bread: dude came around once with bread and that was it. I wanted more bread! He poured some oil and vinegar for us (a lot of it) and gave us 1 piece of bread for it. That's ok I made up for it by eating all the bread stick thingys that are in the cups on the table.   Buddy's Salumi and Cheese Board: damn yo this was real good. I didn't care for the olives but I'm not a fan of them anyway. The meats and cheeses I could have ate all day.  Orecchiette and Italian Sausage: This dish had sausage in its name so I ordered it. It was not as heavy as a spaghetti with sauce which was nice. I ate every bite and would order it again.   Spaghetti Bolognese: I was very surprised to like this. When it came out I expected some sort of red sauce on it but that wasn't the case. My wife took a bite and really liked the taste too. Winner winner bolognese dinner!  Lisa's Warm Nutella Cake: Came with salted caramel ice cream. This was hot and good and everyone should order it.   Zeppole: I guess a spiced sugar is outside of these but I didn't taste anything but fried dough. I didn't like this.",

Their octopus appetizer is full of flavor and cooked to perfection and their egg plant parm is some of the best I've had! Only downside is that they served their wine in cheap small wine glasses which really took away from the experience and did not highlight their well thought out wine list. Just remember to ask for a better glass if you get stuck with one! No other complaints, just a jersey girl proud of a Jersey chef!",

The noise level was a little high and we weren't thrilled by the seating. A lot of the tables were up against a very long bench seat which they all shared. This created a situation where we felt like we were having dinner with the two sets of people on each side of us.  Our waitress wasn't too attentive, but our bus boy was pretty awesome! The food was really good and the potion size was huge. After eating my lasagne it looked as if I didn't even touch it.   The most awesome part was the dessert... I love canolis! They were fabulous!! Perfect hint of cinnamon in the pastry and super yummy cream! My husband has the tiramisu which he said was also great.",

We were seated in the couch/lounge. I thought it looked cozy, only to sit on an extremely awkward, low, deep sunken in seat. Odd. But can be overlooked.   Our server Christin was nice enough, not really helpful when we asked for an opinion of favorites. So I ordered the veal marsala and my husband ordered the ravioli. (How can you mess up ravioli?) Well... after a long wait for food to roll out, his ravioli was disappointing and very very salty. Same salt issue with the veal. My pasta on my plate tasted like pasta roni, and was cold. My veal, extremely hot. The ravioli portion was small and didn't even begin to fill him up even though he tried to stomach the saltiness.   Our birthday canolli was a nice thought, but we didn't really eat it. Maybe we ordered the wrong items? But this felt like a dressed up version of the olive garden. A bit disappointed to end our trip this way. My favorite meal was at B&B downstairs.",

We were greeted by a smiling Italian server who explained to us that we could enjoy the food one of two ways.  The first way being just ordering our own thing off the menu and enjoying it like that or secondly we could close our menus sit back and let the restaurant take us on a culinary experience.  We had to go with a culinary experience.  We were amazed.  The firsts course had meatball, calamari a meat and cheese board and a great salad.  Entree was sea bass, chicken and pasta, lasagna and filet and for dessert a Italian cake and their signature lobster tail.  Everything was so good good and service.

I love Cake Boss's show so I had high hopes for his restaurant. We went at about 345pm on a Thursday afternoon. We were sat right away at a great window table that over looked the strip. It is always nice to feel like we are tourists here even though we have been here almost 3 years now.  We decided to get things we could share...so of course I had to order the garlic cheese bread and Mac.n.cheese to start. Both delicious. The garlic cheese bread was served with amazing marinara sauce. The mac.n.cheese was creamy had pancetta and peas with a crumb top on it. Delicious. Made the way mac.n.cheese should be...creamy goodness. For our main dish we ordered Buddy's favorite pizza and Bolognese. The pizza was yummy, sausage, grilled onions, fennel and 4 different types of cheeses. The crust of the pizza was cooked to perfection, a little crispness, but still soft and very tasty. The sausage was perfect with all the onions and cheese.  The only item I was not impressed with was the Bolognese...lack of flavor, creaminess, and the spaghetti noodles...we're just store bought...I guess since he is a baker...I expected homemade noodles...so I was a little disappointed...and the Bolognese I had at Bootleggers blows this out of the water. It was also $23 for a bowl the wasn't even big enough to feed my man. Had we only ordered this we would have left hungry....and we probably would not ever go back. But luckily we ordered other good dishes...so if we happen to be at the Venetian again and are craving italian...we would go again. I only gave them a 3 because I was disappointed...but I think I just set my bar too high!",

    "text": "Nothing touches this food. Nothing. This is the one restaurant I recommend in Vegas over everything. You'd be doing yourself a disservice if you're in Vegas & looking to eat Italian & don't come here. Don't break the bank at Rao's or Carmine's or some other fine dining Italian restaurant. Eat at the place that feels like home but has the quality of food that can compete with the more expensive places. At those places you're going to pay extra for noodles with your parm. At Buddy V's it's all included for a lower base price.   I'm not going to give a review based on a specific experience because each time I've gone it's been nothing but the best. Girlfriend and I love it. We start with the meatballs that will blow your mind; I order the chicken parm & she orders something new every time. While you wait, piping hot, fresh bread is delivered to you with classic oils for dipping; however, I'm a much bigger fan of dipping it in the meat sauce that comes with the meatballs. Red wine to wash it all down & I am a very happy man.   Aesthetically, the restaurant feels like someone's home; classic oldies & doo wop are played throughout the restaurant. Seating has never been an issue for me even when I go at 6 or 7 PM on a Friday or Saturday. Restaurant may be packed, but there's plenty of bar seating.   Two entrees, an appetizer & a glass of wine runs you roughly $70. Kinda pricey, but well worth it. Servings are huge. Most restaurants in Vegas will run you close to that amount anyways. You came to the wrong city if you're looking to pinch pennies and be frugal.",

I didn't have high expectations for this place because it had a very chain restaurant feel. SO WRONG.   Ordered: x Panzanella Salad w/ Shrimp (buffalo mozzarella, focaccia croutons, tomatoes, arugula, balsamic red onions) - Salad with lots of flavor. Wait, what? It was perfect with the added shrimp, but I think if you order it without protein it'll feel more like a side salad. LOVED this salad. Croutons were amazeballs. x Grilled Salmon (Mediterranean chickpea & artichoke salad, roasted tomato vinaigrette, balsamic) - L-L-LOVEEEEE! I like salmon, but I don't LOVE cooked salmon. kinda tastes the same for me everywhere I order it, but this one was excellent. Highly recommend for a healthy option from the menu. All the components complimented each other very well. x Butterscotch Creme Brulee - My favorite dessert in the world. I didn't really care for the cookies or the vanilla cream it came with, but the creme brulee itself was perfection! Probably one of the best ones I've ever had. 10/10 would recommend.  Service was extremely slow, but the food made up for it. Ask to sit by the window and enjoy A+ food with a strip view :0)  Cake boss knows wssup.",

The service was very good with the waiter being perfectly attentive.  The restaurant has a nice interior and despite  a busy lunch service was very clean.      I ordered the Veal Marsala which was priced at $26.  It came with garlic butter spaghetti noodles.  The garlic butter noodles were the highlight of the plate.  The veal was not even lightly salted and had no flavor.  The Marsala sauce was overly sweet.  It was ok but I have had much better.  I was starved so it filled the void.      I wasn't impressed so this was my last and only visit to Buddy V's.",

The desserts were undeniable, and our server, Moudo, was exceptional.

We then proceeded to wait 35 minutes with him never coming back after taking our order, no bread, no drinks. Finally we complained and the manager, who was beyond apologetic, nice and understanding came over and made sure the rest of our evening was great and it was. It was just disappointing to watch the original waiter serve other people in front of us like we were less important than the other parties. I work hard for my money and chose to spend it at this restaurant so it's disappointing when someone treats me like this. Hay being said the four stars instead of five was because of this. The waitress we were moved to was wonderful and lovely. I don't think I would go back but it was a great experience AFTER the first impression was made.",

That being said, our waiters were terrific - polite and kept our sodas filled. My husband ordered the meatball sandwich, which he enjoyed. His one complaint was that the bread was toasted and made it very hard. I ordered the Chicken BLT, which also had avocado on it. It was quite yummy. It came with a tiny tiny Caesar Salad...

    "text": "With relatively easy entrance from the Strip, competitive pricing to other Italian spots nearby and a nice dining area, it's clear to see why Buddy V's Ristorante has maintained a good level of success since they opened.  I had only previously been to happy hour here, which is one of the best values on the boulevard from 4:30pm-6:30pm daily by the way, and had my mind set on a couple of items prior to walking in.    Skipping formalities, like ya know...salad, we started with \"Grandma's Meatballs\".  The six spheres mixed with beef, veal and pork were very good and perfectly portioned for the group.  I usually prefer them pan-fried first before being dropped into sauce, which these were not, but eaters gonna eat and they disappeared within minutes.    And funny how things are always extra special and endearing once \"Grandma\" is added to the front of it. Grandma's apple pie.  Grandma's pet rat.  Grandma's criminal record.    The \"Bone-In Parm Chop\" was screaming out to me and totally rocked my world.  With a  hefty quantity of crispy, juicy veal meat doused in a mouth-watering marinara sauce and then finished in the oven after being topped with ooey gooey mozzarella and provolone cheese, this dish was outstanding, well presented, and worth the $42.  Being such a large entree, I'd recommend two people going in on it together while getting a few more appetizers to make it a better rounded meal.  I personally felt rounder afterwards.    A couple of other \"can't go wrong\" items I was able to sample were the ultra meaty \"Nonna's Lasagna Al Forno\" and \"Veal Marsala\" with its rich mushroom ragu.  No room for dessert this time, but I am confident that I can count on this spot for a solid \"pasto\" in the future.",

    "text": "We checked out Buddy V's for their weekend brunch buffet.  I love Italian food so this buffet was perfect IMO.  It is not overwhelming big, but has just enough to have a bit of everything.  There is also an option to add on endless wine, beer or mimosas.  The stations include an antipasto bar with cheeses, charcuterie, salads and veggies.  The carving station cooked up Italian sausages and breakfast meats.  The hot food station included Italian style scrambled eggs, pancakes and of course pasta!  My favorite part was the dessert spread with favorites like tiramisu and mini cannoli. I left feeling satisfied, not overly full, and felt I tried everything without having to waste.  The decor and ambiance is also really cool with and open kitchen.",

And most importantly the customer service was excellent.   I ordered the chicken parmesan. At first I was very hesitant because EVERYTIME I order chicken parmesan the chicken is dry and junk. However, I got the $40 special that comes with salad, an entree and a dessert... so out of the entree selections I chose the chicken parmesan and boy did i absolutely enjoy it!! The chicken breast was soooo tender and juicy. They put a nice amount of cheese on top too. I wish they gave a little more noodles, but that's okay. They give two chicken slices and each slice was huge. So good!!  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who values food Italian food!",

I got the dinner deal that came with an app, entree, and dessert, while my BF got pasta with vodka sauce.  The Caesar salad was fantastic! The croutons were the best croutons I have ever had. They were piping hot with soft centers.  My chicken parm was apparently the thing to get (I listened to everyone else's suggestions). It was so much food and very tasty.  My BF's pasta with vodka sauce was good, but he said it tasted like a dish you could get anywhere. Nothing too special  The tiramisu for dessert was good, and had little shortbread cookies for dipping.   Overall, I liked the ambiance and location (within the Venetian), but it wasn't anything super standout. Should've just stuck with his cake shop across the hall!",

Shrimp was cooked perfectly, tender in a butter garlic. $23 4/5 Veal Marsala. Thinly sliced veal in a dark thick wine mushroom sauce. A bit too salty or concentrated. Really good buttery garlic pasta with light cheese topping. I wish I had double pasta. $26 4/5 Trying to decide Lobster tail desert or chocolate Nutella cake? Lobster tail won, very light, flaky crust with cannoli cream and fresh fruit. Some of the crust was non uniform in crunch but very good. $9/each. 5/5 Unsweetened ice tea.

Even the bread that they gave us was focaccia bread and paired perfect with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. All of the pastas were very flavorful and unique from one another. The carbonara was probably my favorite as it was the most creamy. Overall, amazing restaurant with good food and cute aesthetics. They even give you a free cannoli for your birthday!",

    "text": "My family's experience at Buddy V's was one of the highlights of our vacation in and around Vegas.  The highlight of the meal was our waiter Giorgio who was extremely engaging, fun, attentive, and made what would have been a solid meal into something memorably for our family.  He doted on my 9 year old daughter and gave her a stuffed animal and chef's hat.  He dared us to guess how many Italian wedding cakes he ate over two hours to capture the \"world record\" and gave the winning guess a Buddy V's glass.  He accommodated two vegetarians in the family and removed all the guesswork from ordering...we just put our trust in him and he brought out a lot of good food!  In terms of the food, I'd say the fare ranged from slightly above average to very good.  The meatballs were great and the meats in the antipasto appetizer were awesome as well.  I didn't think the lasagna was all that special but the rest of the family loved it.  Anyway, the highlight to me was the service and this restaurant would be the first one I'd head back to with my family if we're in Vegas again.",

The bottomless mimosas, Bellinis, and sangrias were great.  Nice atmosphere, place was cozy.  Totally worth the experience.",

    "text": "Buddy V's, for those who don't know who he is, I'm going to tell you. he is the owner of Carlo's Bakery and has a show Cake Boss and now Buddy V's Ristorante in Vegas. So as I entered was greeted right away with a Hostess and asked to be seated by the window,with no seats available by the window, we all chose to sit in the middle of the Restaurant, not what we all wanted. Would have waited for a booth by the window. She should have stated to us,if you would like to wait for one, we all would have waited. I'm sure, I'm not the only one who has no patience when it comes to food and being hungry.I want to eat,relax and enjoy great company with family and friends,especially a bunch of Italians. So the server comes over and takes our drink order and returns with the drinks and takes our meal order. As our meals came out, I was surprised at the portion size of the spaghetti with marinara sauce,small and the presentation of the chicken parmesan with spaghetti,plain. The spaghetti sauce had a good taste to it, however the Chicken Parmesan didn't. The Server wasn't attentive to our needs,during my visit the busboy was more attentive,but the one thing that blew us all away was at the server bought our check over and didn't even ask us would you like any Dessert. The check was put on the table and walked away. Mind you not this is my Birthday dinner and the owner started is Business,as a cake baker and as you walk in that's what you see is a display of the Dessert's they offer. Unbelievable.Must retrain server's at the close of each check,offer. So the check was paid and we walked right a cross to his small little bakery Carlo's Bakery. 39/100 Yelp Challenge.(2018)",

    "text": "Synopsis: A wonderful value for the price without the snobbery of a lot of Vegas flagship restaurants.   We booked a birthday dinner here on a Sunday at 5.30 pm. It was busy, but not packed. The wait for walk-ins was about 30 mins.   I hate to say this, but the host staff could use some work. The two girls that checked us in and seated us seemed unbothered to greet and talk to patrons. As a local, I observe this often with restaurants on the Strip. It's disappointing. As a host it is your job to present me with a first impression about your brand and establishment.   Moving on...  Our waiter (I did not get your name but you are Australian/South African/Amercian) was so sweet and so lovely. Once he had a chance to take care of our table he treated us like he was his only table.   We ordered:  Calamari Fritti app Sunday Gravy x 2 Salmon Lasagna  The calamari was cooked to perfection. You could actually cut it with the side of your fork! The Anaheim peppers were a nice touch and very unique. Well done! The only thing...the oil it was cooked in needed to be changed as the breading came out a little dark.   The salmon was also cooked to perfection. It beautifully fell apart when I cut into it. It was a very large portion. I shared it with my infant daughter, who loved it! And you know babies are the harshest critics! It came on a bed of salad, which had a wonderful flavor.   The guys were so impressed with the Sunday Gravy. If you don't know what this is - most Italian restaurants don't bother serving it because it takes all day to cook. Theirs they said takes 18 hours and is cooked throughout the day. We loved it. The flavors were amazing. The meat was so tender. The portion was gigantic.   Same with the lasagna. It could easily feed 2-3 people. My mom barely put a dent in it. If you don't like sausage, don't order this because it has a very strong sausage flavor. They brought a beautiful little Tiramisu cake for my mom, which really made her day. The waiter stayed to sing happy birthday with us, which was sweet.   The were very accommodating to our baby, who is 9 months old. Our waiter made suggestions on thing she could eat and was very complimentary about her behavior. One note: they do not allow strollers inside the dining area, but you can leave them at the front.   So, we ordered an app, we all ordered wine/beer, four entrees, and a desert...the bill was UNDER $200, which is simply impressive for a restaurant on the Strip with good quality. I'm really pleased with our dining experience.",

    "text": "A great place within the Venetian for dinner.  We made reservations via Open Table but you likely (at least on this day) wouldn't have needed to.  Either way I felt good about having them.  I like to plan ahead.    They seated us in the bar area, which I liked a lot it seemed like families with smaller children where more in the main area so it was nice.  There was a TV in the bar so you could keep up with the latest game that was on.  We brought in a bottle of wine and their corkage fee was $35.  In looking at the menu that was a bargain for wine.  Our wine cost us about $35 originally so, yeah, still paying about $70 a bottle.  It was still all good.  Dinner was fantastic and fairly large portions.  I took mine back to the hotel with me and it was our lunch the next day.  I had the chicken piacatta and was amazing.    I would definitely come back here again.",

At the waitress's suggestion we ordered it and it was AMAZING.  The best I've ever had hands down.  We then ordered the \"Sunday gravy\" which is really a massive amount of various meats swimming in some really zesty sauce served with Rigatoni.  Tasted like someone's grandma was sitting in the kitchen! All in all the service was friendly, drinks were quick, and the food was amazing.  Will definitely be coming back !",

We decided to go here because we had just rolled into town and we were staying at the Palazzo, and wanted someplace low-key where we could dine with our teen.  We made a reservation and were good to go.  We didn't know that the meal came with foccacia, so we ordered cheesy garlic bread to go with our caesar salads.  Next time, we will skip the cheesy garlic bread, as it was very cheesy but not really garlicky.  The caesars were good, but came with very hot polenta croutons.  They were kind of strange!  For our main meal we had ravioli with alfredo, lasagna and an order of meatballs.  My favorite was the lasagna!  Lots of flavor and enough sauce that we were happy with it.  They've got a great menu and we would definitely return!",

    "text": "Great experience and amazing service...  Here's a legit spot to get Italian food on the strip of Vegas. Had a plentiful selection of dishes ranging from pasta to pizza to seafood/meat. Overall cost for the dishes were sorta pricey... However, we're in Vegas so the whole situation is justified   Here's we're we got:  Focaccia Bread 5/5- So bomb ! I wanted to eat the four or five more rolls but we had so much food. Dipped this in oil/balsamic and it's like heaven.  Calamari Fritti 5/5 - so delicious! The breading was perfection. Not too dense and not too salty. The perfect blend. I would highly recommend it!  Grandma's Meatballs 3/5 - they aight. Personally, didn't think it was anything special.  I feel like I make better balls myself .   Dad's Bucatini Carbonara 4/5 - This dish was very rich and creamy. I was in the mood for something like this so I knew what to expect.  I was very pleased with the taste and how it turned out. There was a nice crunch from the pancetta. But beware, this might be the creamiest dish on the menu. The sauce was so nice and think that I felt like my stomach was putting on a warm blanket to keep my belly warm.  Mother and Law's Shrimp Scampi with Linguine 4/5  - here's a nice size plate with good size shrimp. Scampi sauce was buttery and rich and worked with the pasta.  Veal Marsala 4/5 - Strong plate with a very nice protein.  Marsala sauce was very good with a strong red wine taste. Veal was super tender and tasty.  Caramelized Sea Scallop 4/5 - Very good dish. 6 small sea scallops and everything was very tasty. Crispy prosciutto and parmesan polenta was on point. Only negative was that the dish might be good for someone with a smaller appetite. You definitely get more bang for the buck on a pasta dish.  Lisa V's Linguine and Clams 4/5 - Another great dish. Sauce was tasty, clams were fresh, good size. Can't really screw up a clam linguine unless you really try.  Overall, solid place to eat and great service. Great for taking a date. Didn't get any dessert because we were so full. But I'll be getting that next time!  AC",

I was convinced that they made a mistake and brought us real meatballs ins, but was reassured that it was, in fact, vegetarian. Absolutely amazing flavor. We will be ordering this every time we come back.   Update: Last time we went the \"Meatless Meatballs\" had been removed from the menu unfortunately. Regardless, every other food item I've had here has been fantastic and I still highly recommend eating here.",

    "text": "Buddy V's is a great Vegas strip experience.  The Brunch is fantastic , and a window seat for people watching is a fun way to chill out while you sample their unlimited drink option. We tried the sangria with brandy and fresh fruit, the pomegranate mimosa, and the Bloody Mary with a full condiment station. All were superlative, we sampled them over and over.  The brunch is done buffet style but with small trays that are refilled  frequently.  The antipasto/charcuterie table is outstanding we selected a great blue cheese variant, prosciutto, shrimp, focaccia and cheesy bread. The chef's corner entrees were fantastic, the standouts were the mac n' cheese carbonara, Sunday eggs, and crepes with in-house whipped cream and an amazing compote that was entirely comprised of fresh berries. The carving station had delicious sausages and a sumptuous slab bacon that was more like pork belly. At most brunch buffets the deserts are so-so but this is the cake boss's place so they were all incredible the exceptional items were the cannoli, zeppoli, and Italian cookies platter.   The service was friendly and accommodating regardless of how busy the restaurant became.",

It is all hype and way too expensive for Italian food. The real question is was the service good? Ehhhh it was okay, not amazing and just okay. Was the food good? Well this is where I'm in the fence, it was good but not 30 dollars good for Alfredo either. Now would I go back? No, I would not go back because the service and food were not worth the 80 I spent on two dinners  without anything other than Alfredo and lasagna. If the dinners came with a salad, soup, or even two pieces of bread I would think about going again. I didn't even order a beverage, just had water and two dinners.",

Upon being seated we were met with welcoming and friendly customer/guest service.  Caleb was our server and hit a Grand Slam in doing so. He was very attentive to our request and even provided suggestions when I seemed unsure.  I ordered the Tomato & Basil soup and my wife ordered the  Aunt Nina's Mozzarella en Carozza for appetizers. At first bite, the authenticity of the food was evident and the Riesling and Moscato wine that followed were right on time.  Shortly after finishing the appetizers, our entrees showed up and my wife's Capellini Shrimp Scampi and my Nonna's Lasagna Al Forno  dishes pushed the experience over the top.  All the while being treated like relatives by Adam, the Asst. General Manager. I pulled Adam to the side and mentioned that I had a confession and that was, that my wife and I eat out a lot, while home and this was the best all around experience we've had in a long time and thanked him for the wonderful experience.  The cherry on top was when they brought out a piece of Chocolate Expresso cake, on the house, for the Mrs.'s birthday and a couple of lattes. This customer service is what I strive to exemplify in my own business at Ambassador Barbershop, Atlanta, GA, because long term relationships are better than short term money, any day.  Adam and Caleb, we'll see you next time we're in Vegas. Thanks again, K. Jones",

I had to come back here because of that AMAZING carbonara mac n cheese, but it was on the verge of awful this time.  The stuff in the brunch is not good at all compared to when they make it fresh for you!  It is to die for when it's fresh.  In the brunch, it's been sitting around etc, and isn't very good.  The salads were good.  The Caesar salad croutons are very different.  There almost like a cornmeal texture.  The arugula salad was delicious.  Chicken Parmesan was ok, but I'm sure it would be excellent if made fresh.  All around, the pastas were kind of disappointing.  It's cool to have a bottomless mimosa/Bloody Mary option.  Roughly $15, but it's bottomless.  Service from the bartender Emily was fantastic!  Not a remote complaint in that department.  We would come back, but won't do the brunch.",

Decor: Great views of the strip from the window booth. Nicely laid out with not too many tables and not too close together.  However, the cold air was blowing on us the entire time and I didn't go to Vegas for the cold weather.  Please fix this.  Food: Turkey meatballs were wonderful.  Chicken Parm was chewy and probably overcooked.  We came for the desserts and were disappointed that there isn't a more traditional cake.

The beef tenderloin was on the rare side for a medium.  Kudos to the kitchen.  For the service, I'll keep it short. Just our luck as first time diners to get the waitress in training on a Saturday night.  It would have been tolerable if she had any personality or acted if she even cared about our experience there.  Never engaged us, we had to continually ask for refills on water,  and brought me the wrong drink.  Trainer right at her side, for what? I blame the management and trainer for this.   Servers in training should be up to speed for the weekend dinner service before being put there.  When customers leave satisfied with the food but disgruntled over the service after paying nearly three bills for a mediocre dining experience, you end up losing a repeat customer.    You want great reviews and repeat business? Then don't use the trial by fire method with new servers and send them to charm school first.",

    "text": "Oh my goodness we had the best salad (Buddy's Caprese) to start and were smart enough to share the salad and meatball sandwich.  The salad had the most unbelievable croutons in it.  I almost filled up on those alone.  Oh and the cheese in it... stop it.  So delicious.  We then shared the meatball sandwich and fries.  The sandwich is a bit messy just as any good Italian should be.  I thought the meatballs were very good and authentic.  I am surprised by the low reviews from various people because my experience could not have been better.  I also went to the bakery across the way and bought a cookie and brownie and both tasted homemade.  I really dislike \"bakery\" tasting cookies and to my surprise these were as if I had baked them in my own kitchen.  I'd highly suggest this place.  Also, I noticed a great room for big parties which I might use when in town again on business down the road.  The bar has a cool ambiance although I was there during the day on a Monday so it wasn't crowded.  I'll go back for sure!",

Valastro Sunday Night gravy is one of those thick, rich and hearty Italian dishes that you imagine Sophia would be cooking for the Golden Girls on a cheesecake and ice cream night. So saucy and full of meat, meat,  meat!!! Veal, sausage, pork, meatballs and bones. Ohhh the lovely bones. I ditched the rigatoni for spaghetti and I was soooo satisfied. Shame on me for swooping down on the soft and super tasty basket of bread like a starved hawk. So much bread made for a crowded tummy but I couldn't help myself. Butter and olive oil for sopping weren't necessary. That's just how tasty the bread was. Dessert??? There was no room and no way. This ain't The Olive Garden. The chefs in Buddy V's ristorante were definitely paying attention to their Italian grannies in the kitchen. I'm sure of it.",

The service was impeccable - friendly & attentive. The server was knowledgeable and described the dishes well. We are \"Wine Snobs\" so we were worried about the wine selection, but to our surprise they had a great selection of Italian and Californian Wines, and the Server seemed fairly knowledgeable and recommended a suitable Italian Wine. And the food was everything we hoped it would be - classic, fresh, simple and delicious.  The restaurant was busy and vibrant.The kitchen is situated right in the middle of the restaurant, and you can watch the action. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.",

The wait was about 20 minutes so we just grabbed a seat at the bar easily which was great, however we were pretty much ignored for 15 minutes until the bartender finally came over. My friend asked for the wine list and the way she rolled her eyes you would think that's a dumb question (is that a dumb question?). When she finally came back another 10 minutes later to get drinks I asked for a food menu and that was also apparently really labor-intensive for her because she seemed crazy annoyed. The place wasn't that busy but I could tell she was the only one behind the bar which I can sympathize -- I'm a pretty patient person so if I have to wait it's not usually a big deal as long as you're pleasant when you do get to me. So that whole exchange was sort of a bummer.   All that said the food was pretty good. Not the best Italian food I've ever had but it was straightforward pasta and good sauce. I had the rigatoni and my friend had the orecchiette and both were good enough that we finished them.   Will I go back? Meh. But I am pretty excited the bakery is opening across the hall!",

The octopus and tuna caponata are also delicious and the polenta croutons on the Caesar Salad are delicious! I've never seen polenta croutons in all the Italian restaurants I've dined in. Very creative!  Dessert is also a must, I mean it is the Cake Boss' restaurant. The lobster tail is light and crispy and the tiramisu is soooo good with the chocolate cake on the bottom.   A trip to Buddy V's is definitely a must and the food was so much better than what I had at Carnevino at a fraction of the cost!",

The restaurant itself is lovely with a tastefully decorated interior and comfortable seating.  The service was excellent, very professional and courteous from our waitress to the bussers. The complimentary bread with Olive Oil and Balsamic Dipping plate was delicious, the bread warm and fluffy and the olive oil and balsamic very flavorful.  The Garlic Bread Appetizer was so tasty, warm and very cheesy...we ate every crumb.  The Salumi & Cheese Board Appetizer was outstanding...very flavorful, quality, thinly sliced Proscuitto, Cappicolla and Salami along with Grana Padano and Parmeggiano, and Gorgonzola Cheeses and delicious olives. The entrees were a home run for all seven of us.  The Veal Marsala, Chicken Parm, Chicken Picatta, Steak Pizzaiola ...all perfectly cooked, good portion size and the accompanying Broccolini and/or Buttered Spaghetti Noodles just made the dishes even more pleasing.  The Sunday Gravy signature dish was excellent, the sauce authentic Italian and the combination of meats reminded us of our mother's and grandmother's typical Sunday dinners.  The wine selection was impressive and our Pinot Grigio and Chianti choices did not disappoint.  Loved this restaurant ... the best dinner we had in Vegas during our trip.",

It was like sitting at a coffee table to eat dinner. Between that and the giant  LED screen outside the window blinding half of our party, it was quite uncomfortable. We were there a good 20 minutes before the waiter came to take our drink orders and it went downhill from there.   The garlic bread was disgusting, and the chicken parm tasted like a frozen TV dinner.   And that brings us to the service... Our waiter was the rudest server I have ever had. I was on a business trip and needed to have the checks split, which took him 3 tries and about 25 minutes to get right. Then, when he didn't bring me an itemized receipt (which I need for business trip expenses), I asked for one and the reaction I received was rolled eyes and gritted teeth. He did eventually bring it, but it was served with a lot of unnecessary attitude.   I would give 0 stars if I could.",

    "text": "First off - the food was good.  I recommend the Mac & Cheese.  It all went sideways from there.  A group of us decided to give it a try last week.  We got right in and the service was fast.  The server knew nothing about where she worked nor any details about the cake boss himself or the famous bakery across the hall.  We informed her as to who Buddy is.  Bad start for this employee we thought.  Later that night we decided to give the bakery a try and experience the famous treats we had only seen on the TV show.  We waited in the long line and ordered our treats.  After we paid, I heard some construction noise and realized that a construction person was knocking bricks off the wall some 15 feet behind us.  In fact the debris actually hit one of our guests.  In the small bakery their is a small bar to sit at, but in this case that was even closer to the construction guy.  We asked the cashier if we could sit across the hall at the Buddy V's to enjoy our treats.  She said ok but to inform the host.  We crossed the hall and asked the host if we could sit in the dining area that was in the hall, she said no that area was closed.  The restaurant was near empty and I clearly pointed out the construction mess as it was only 30 feet across the hall.  I then asked if we could sit anywhere inside to eat our already paid for treats.  She said no, I should go eat it at the bar inside the bakery.  Needless to say we left and found some tables out in the mall.    I can not believe that the same establishment from across I the hall would treat people so negatively.  I will not return given their lack of service.  Too bad, the food was pretty good.  They really need some training as to who they work for as well as the True value of a customer.  I will never go back for that reason.",

We were gonna go grab dessert next door and the bakery and we're glad we didnt. Our enthusiastic server named Georgio recommended us to have the dessert there. They brought us the desert menu which was adorable like a photo album with family photos in it as well. They had what we would have gotten next door and served it garnished with extra cream and chocolate and even fresh fruit. This place is a must to stop in.",

Luckily, my boyfriend comes from a line of Italian chefs and isn't afraid to be super critical when it comes to Italian, and I can say he would have approved and I can't wait to take him here. The eggplant Parmesan was mouth watering my delicious, and caprese salad had the freshest ingredients. The four sides we ordered (polenta, asparagus, kale, and mashed potatoes) were a bit too over seasoned or cheesy, but the main dishes were phenomenal. Highly recommend the cheese/cured meat board. Friendly atmosphere with a great view of the strip.",

All we wanted were some appetizers and drinks and they wouldn't even let us in because they were \"completely booked\" that night and people were coming \"at any second\".

We ordered the chicken picatta and added mushrooms and it was quite tasty, chicken marsala, lasagna, linguine with clams, mac and cheese, chicken rigatoni alla vodka, the caprese salad,  caesar salad, and veal marsala. Everything was pleasing to the palate. I also ordered the salted caramel ice cream to go and it was delicious. I would definitely come back here again to get my Italian fix the next time I'm in town.",

It tasted like sugar imbalanced with more sugar. At $8 a peice it was hardly worth the price and it took me almost 8 sittings to finish because i couldnt handle more than 3 bites at a time due to overwhelming and overpowering flavour of sugar. I love desserts but it wasnt balanced at all and honestly most church bakers or even school bake sales make better cake.   Only upside was the short line and the great single serve packaging for the cakes to go. Otherwise skip it and head ANYWHERE else. Its a fad place from tv and the desserts are extremely lacking in quality.",

Locate Tao, then use the exterior door to get the covered balcony, hang a right and it's past Rock House. I'm usually good at navigating casinos but this place was hidden! Worth seeking out though.  Came in for Restaurant Week lunch menu with Lauren C- $20, 3 courses, $4 donation to Three Square food bank, so a win all around. As expected, they are spectacularly good at carbs here, from the house focaccia you are served upon seating to the polenta croutons in the Caesar. We shared the spaghetti and meatball and chicken parm entrees, both with more than ample pasta for a lunch portion with a great robust sauce and well-seasoned protein. I'm not much of a dessert person, but the NJ style cheesecake was well made and nicely accented by strawberry compote and chocolate almonds.   Service was attentive and I really love the ambiance of the dining room. While this spot is hard to find, I'd come back to try more. As a local, RW is great for giving a discounted opportunity to try a place I otherwise wouldn't seek out (who voluntarily goes to the Strip these days?!), while giving back at the same time!",

Caesar salad was unremarkable but the polenta croutons it was topped with were fantastic! They had a hint of lemon that really made them stand out. The tomato basil soup was also a hit. For entrees we had chicken parm & spaghetti meatballs. The chicken was moist and flavorful as were the meatballs. The pasta was cooked perfect but the sauce was just average. Not something I would want again. We were too full for dessert & got it go. Totally enjoyed it later!!   I might return for happy hour. I heard they have the croutons as an appetizer on the menu.",

Both times I had reservations and was seated right away.   On my most recent visit I started with the Caesar Salad. The salad was basic and not overly exciting, but the polenta croutons on top were tasty. The warm bread served with oil and vinegar was pretty good.   Spaghetti and Meatballs made for a hearty, delicious lunch. The meatballs were fairly seasoned and I liked the spaghetti sauce on the dish. My friend's Chicken Parmesan was my favorite of the two dishes though. The chicken had plenty of breading and cheese.   I'm a big dessert person and both hit the spot for me. The Cannoli had a great tasting filling with yummy chocolate chips and pistachios on one end. I just tasted the Cheesecake, but loved the flavor and I don't usually care for cheesecake.  Buddy V's is probably not my first pick for Italian in town, but a solid option if in the area. A big perk is Carlo's Bakery across the hall for more post dinner sweets.",

    "text": "I was torn writing this review.  I was stuck on a three or a four star, but eventually decided on the three for several reasons.  The first one was how we were greeted.  This seems to be a trend in Vegas where the hostesses don't really care if you are there or not.  Hi I am here and we have a reservation followed by the rolling of the eyes from the hostess.   We get seated and are promptly waited on and drinks arrive quickly after.  Our server was attentive but had very little personality and seemed like he did not care to be there either.   My sons and I shared the salumi platter which was very good.  My oldest ordered a plain cheese pizza which he really liked.  My youngest got the meatball sub which he also liked.  The meatballs were really good and tender and came with a huge pile of fries.  Now here is another reason why I gave the three stars, my veal Marsala and my wife's carbonara were just completely over seasoned in black pepper.  My veal's breading had so much it killed the flavor or the wine sauce.  I know there is supposed to be pepper in carbonara, but not to the point it mutes out all other flavors by numbing your tongue. If I was in the area I might stop again, but it wouldn't be my first choice and most likely we well be heading back to Rao's.  It is more expensive, but the atmosphere and service are far better and the food doesn't numb your palate.",

    "text": "I don't think I'm the only person whose mouth starts to water, when watching a show like the Sopranos and the show's characters converge around good Italian food all the while remarking, \"Gravy is good tonight\" or that scene in 'Goodfellas' where the wiseguys are making dinner in prison. Those scenes always had me craving for good American-Italian food.   Buddy V's wasn't even on my radar when the wife and I went to Las Vegas during Christmas. Come dinnertime on Christmas Day the wife and I had no idea where to eat with all the restaurants around the area but thanks to Yelp, and all the other people reviewing, we decided to give Buddy V's a shot and both of us were not disappointed.  First Impression  The restaurant has a down home feel to it. Nothing fancy so don't feel bad if you're dressed casually. The hostess was cheerful and it took her a few minutes to prepare a table and get us seated on a fairly busy evening.  Service  Our waitress, Nichole, and the server working the area were excellent. Both were friendly and always checking at appropriate intervals in to see how things were and making sure our water glasses were always filled up and that our plates were cleared and new utensils provided.  Food  As first timers who were both very hungry and looking to indulge, we started with 'Aunt Ninas Mozzarella en Carrozza' and 'My Wife's Eggplant Parm'. Both were delicious and actually quite filling. In hindsight, we probably would have skipped the appetizers if we knew what a generous portion of food would be coming with the pasta dishes we ordered.  For the main course, my wife ordered 'Lisa V's Linguine and Clam' and I had the 'Valastro Sunday Gravy' as well as a glass of red wine to go with it.   The linguine and clam was perfect. A generous amount of large clams and linguine whose texture was perfectly al dente. At other restaurants, they would skimp on the clams and you'd not only get a small amount of clams but the clams they used were tiny. Not here. Large clams and plenty of them!  When the server brought the Valastro Sunday Gravy that's when I knew I had bitten off more than I could chew. It was a large dish filled with meatballs, Italian sausage, a large piece of lamb and a massive portion of pork, all covered in a hearty and delicious tomato sauce plus a separate bowl of rigatoni. Wow.  By the end of the dinner I was so full and could barely move. Definitely no space for dessert so unfortunately we weren't able to try the desserts that brought Buddy Valastro fame. Until the next time!",

I decided on this place because of all the wonderful reviews and I'm so happy that I did. I ordered my favorite linguine with fresh clams and hubby ordered the chicken rigatoni ala vodka sauce. Both dishes tasted amazing and I would definitely order the linguine clams again. We weren't really hungry so we didn't order appetizers or a salad. They also offer fresh baked foccacia bread with was phenomenal so make sure you get some because they don't always provide it. Hubby made the mistake of eating too much bread so he had to take the rest of his pasta to go.",

    "text": "Went to Vegas for a bachelorette celebration and we planned to have a nicer dinner on the last day of our stay. Everyone loves Italian, right?! Right!  Buddy V's is located inside the Palazzo and on one side is the restaurant and on the other side is the cake shop. We had reservations for 7pm on a Sunday night (on Memorial day weekend) and we still had to wait a pretty long time to be seated. So much for a reservation, but that's not too huge of a deal I guess. I was just getting tired standing in my heels lol.  Aesthetically, this plays feels very home-y, which I liked. There were photos of Buddy and his family members incorporated into the dessert menu (it was really cute), and there were photos all around the restaurant--makes you just feel good inside when you know that this is a longtime family tradition!   We were seated and a few minutes passed before we met our server. He introduced the idea that we could order family style or we could just order individual plates. Although ordering family style would probably be a more economical option, it was just too much fuss to do with a group of 8 girls. A lot of us (including myself) ended up getting the chicken parm, and a few others ordered a pasta dish (the one with the vodka sauce, I forgot the  name). ALL OF THE FOOD WAS SO DELICIOUS. WOW. Even the appetizers and bread that we got was finger-licking good. JUST LET THE CARBS WIN. GET THE FOCCACIA BREAD APPETIZER TOO. You'll thank me later...   Although we didn't need the server too much, he was nowhere to be found, never really checked up on us, so service gets a ding.  The price point was really reasonable given the enormous portions we got (chicken parm dish gives you 2 large breast cutlets; this is easily shareable). We had tons of leftovers that we happily ate after a long night of dancing.   The only reason this review gets 4 stars is because the service. It was just lacking. But everything else, just superb! Superb food, superb pricing, portions, value, etc. I try not to eat that many carbs, but when in Vegas, carb it up. And come here to do it. Pasta and bread all day BRO! ha.",

We were seated promptly when we arrived and were greeted with smiles and water at our table.  Our wait staff was attentive so we never needed anything.  The food was delicious and timely.  We told the staff we had a show later and they ensured we had enough time to enjoy our dinner and still make the show.  I would come back.",

The portions are small but the food is fresh and you can go get more of whatever you like if you want more. It also gives you a chance to try a variety of items. We opted for the bottomless alcohol and it was worth it. They had mimosas, bellinis, domestic beer, and sangria. All of the staff are so sweet and attentive. Definitely give it a try if you are in the casino.",

It was a Friday night and we didn't have a reservation (just made it in town) and checked in around 8pm.  The wait was about 45 minutes and they buzzed us right around that time.  We had the garlic bread, clam linguine, and chicken parmesan.  Everything was delicious.  The marinara on the side of spaghetti that came with the chicken parmesan was amazing.  My family has our own homemade sauce, but I will admit, this one was better.  Hopefully I can find the recipe online or in a cookbook Buddy puts out!  The dessert menu was more of what you see in a traditional Italian restaurant, so we went across the way to his bakery for dessert.  Which again was delicious and reasonably priced.  I had the raspberry linzer cookie and my husband a cupcake.  All in all food and service was great.  Will be going back the next time we are staying on the strip.",

We came around 5 pm in the evening, and I was pleased to find that the wait was only a few minutes, and that we were promptly seated.  The service was quick and respectable, as well.   The food here is a bit upscale, but still not too bad.  We got two different carbonara dishes - one of them a macaroni carbonara!  I really loved the macaroni dish, although my boyfriend said he liked the pasta a lot more.  I thought they were both very creamy and rich with flavor, and tasted delicious.  They were also very filling, and we were full by the time we finished!    They provide little packs with sticks of bread in them on the table, but I didn't care for them too much.  I kind of was wishing that they would provide some complimentary bread and olive oil like a lot of Italian restaurants, but they didn't offer any.    All in all, a solid Italian restaurant at The Strip.  Very good, solid Italian pasta dishes, and efficient service.  A bit pricey, but reasonable for the type of restaurant that it is, and I feel I thoroughly enjoyed my experience.",

My husband ordered the Chicken Parm and found that the chicken parm at Maggiano's was much better.  Our waitress was rushed and not pleasant at all. Big let down for sure.

    "text": "I would give this place a 4.5 stars. I was pleasantly surprised how delicious the food was! I read the reviews, however, with my experience eating at bacchanal buffet, I was a bit skeptical and had no expectation eating here. Not sure if it was me being skeptical and had no expectation, but the food was amazing. The dinner bread was soft and delicious. The salad (Panzanella) was surprisingly good. I thought it would be just some ordinary balsamic vinaigrette salad, but the flavors of the mix greens, cheese, and tomatoes really worked well together. The calamari was crispy, I recommend to ask for marinara on the side to cut up the oiliness from the calamari. We ordered the lasagna and OMG the portion size is huge! we ordered one to share, but it came out like two individual entrees. Finally, for dessert and OMMMGG the banana bread pudding is to die for. Great texture and flavor all mixed together to perfection. It was not overly sweet, even though, it looked like it would be, but it is not. The crunchiness from the nuts (I think pecans) and the soft bread with the vanilla ice cream (*smacking lips) works sooooo well together. I would say this is the best bread pudding I ever had. Even though, me and my fiance was full from the other foods, we definitely had room to finish every single bite of this perfection. Overall, best experience and for the price and the portion size of the foods, I would say is fair.",

On the plus side, service was quick and waitstaff excellent (otherwise this place would only have gotten 2 stars). The olive oil/balsamic dipping sauce was excellent (but not enough to redeem the sorry focaccia). The lemonade was great - for $10, glad it came with free refills.",

One good thing was that they didn't have any dress code which was important because i sure didn't feel like dressing up and walk a casino with heels on.    There was live music performed by 2 incredible guys. The singer song need amazing and very classy.  Now back to the food. To start of I had grilled octopus and cheesy garlic bread. I was a bit skeptical about the octopus but it was really good. After that I had the mamas linguine and shrimp pasta. I ate a lot more that I'm reviewing. All I must say is if you come to Vegas and your in the mood for some home made Italian food come to this place.",

    "text": "This review is for Sunday brunch. It starts at 10:30 in the morning. It goes until early afternoon. The price is around $35 per person, unless you include bottomless Mimosas or sangrias or Bellinis for an added $15 or bloody Mary's for an added $17 with the souvenir cup. We chose not to do that. There are a few stations around the restaurant. To begin with, there is a children's station with candy, pizza, fruit, and raw sliced vegetables. There is a meat section with apple sausage, thick bacon, and other choices. There is a soup and salad/antipasto section. There is a warm food section which has scrambled eggs, Sunday Alex, French toast, crepes with options for feelings, a penne carbonara dish, a tagliatelle dish, traditional Italian meatballs, and several other yummy choices. Finally there is a desert section. The tagliatelle and penne dishes were disappointing and very average. Other than that, everything was delicious. The breakfast is very good. The dessert table is pretty good and the best part is the bread pudding. The tiramisu was a let down for me which is surprising but I have had way better. The service is very good. The restaurant is nice. We did have to ask for a different table as we found out our table was way too close to the next table and it was hard to get out to get to the food stations. For the price, this place is reasonable. Other places are way more expensive. It is not a five star brunch, but it's a solid four star.  This is a good place for families and it is a great place for kids.",

On arrival, we had him store a birthday cake that we bought at Carlo's Bakery so that we can sing happy birthday and have the cake for dessert. It took the a very long time to take out order and being our drinks. The food took even longer. He did not stop by our table to check on our refills or if we needed anything. We had to flag him down each time we needed something. It seemed like we were in the restaurant forever because the service was so slow. We could no longer wait on him so we asked for our cake and decided to bring it back to the hotel.  Other than that, I loved everything about the place and plan on visiting again.",

Items we ordered were very good. Originally met by an unfriendly Hostess (I assume she's tired of answering \"where do I sit for HH?\") but our server was very nice, attentive and busy. Would like to revisit if in the area and order off menu but it is pricey.",

I will take the long annoying walk from valet for it, it's that good.  My sister and I took my dad here for his 60'th birthday. We didn't want to be too fancy, but still wanted authentic Italian food. I am so glad we went out on a limb and tried Buddy V's!  They have a selection of appetizers, most named after a family member. Then for entrees they offer pasta, meatballs, veal, chicken, tons of Italian classics! As a family of 6 Italians at the table, I can tell you we were very satisfied. My dad wanted a veal picatta. They have chicken picatta, and veal angelo, so they didn't hesitate to make him the dish he wanted.  I went with a Sunday gravy dish, and it exceeded expectations. The appetizer platter of select meats and cheeses was phenomenal! Literally the best prosciutto and blue cheese I ever tasted.  We skipped on dessert because of course we went across the hall to Carlo's! I am sure it was the same cannolis, but it's the point!  This will be an Italian place I continue to come to over the years. It hit the spot!",

    "text": "After reading some positive reviews I wanted to try Buddy V's for some decent Italian food. It's a nice place with a nice view of the strip, with the neon lights flickering in the background. Here is what we had: - Grandmas Meatballs. These were pretty tast but our order was cold. I know they are not made to order  but you expect them to be warm. -Calamari Fritti. You basic calamari with 2 slivers of a banana pepper and grilled lemon. Another dish that came out cold. -Lisa V's Linguini and white clam sauce. This dish has the most balanced flavors and a decent amount of clams. This was the 3rd dish in a row that was cold. I would have mentioned it to our server but he wasn't around much. -My mother in laws shrimp scampi. The one dish that came out warm . It had pretty good flavors but not the best scampi I ever had. My mother in laws is much better!.  Where most authentic Italian restaurants might offer you freshly grated parm you had to ask for it and it took a few minutes to let the food get even colder. We also asked for some bread, mainly for the scampi since it had a nice broth build up in the bottom of the bowl. The waiter looked as if I was asking for ketchup at a steak house. Another dissapointing Italian meal in Las Vegas, my search continues!",

It's good to see that even the Cake Boss knows you gotta spice up your drinks to make people get sloshed (like we did for a big reunion party).  I had a berry mohjito that was absolutely kick ass.  The bartender was also very friendly and did a good job of making sure the drinks kept flowing.  The ambiance of this place is really nice and there's a good amount of space that can accommodate a large number of guests, making it a great meeting spot if you're part of a big party or celebration.",

    "text": "I chose Buddy V's for our 10 year anniversary reception dinner. We were a group of 12 people including two young kids and a preteen. When we arrived for our 6:30pm reservation, we were asked to go to the bar and wait for the table however once we all started to walk into the bar, the receptionist saw we had our two small kids with us and said that the kids could not be in the bar area. She told us to wait a few minutes and she would have the table rushed to get ready. A few minutes later it was ready, and we sat down at a nice large rectangular table near the open kitchen. At the time, I didn't think twice about the 'go to the bar' hand off but now that I am writing the review, I realize that this was mostly likely a way for them to get us to spend some additional money.  Anyway, we sat and we chose to do the family style dining. Everything tasted amazing, the food just kept coming out. I waitress told me the chefs knew how much to serve, but it was clearly too much. A shame really, as a lot of it was boxed up but we were all staying in hotels with no available space in the frig (all weight sensitive booze filled frigs). I would recommend order your own dishes, according to your group appetite, and then share it all. Every dish we had was excellent. Meatballs, lasagna, pasta, sea bass all excellent.",

Yes, I agree it is a bit pricey, but what my fiance and I ended up doing is splitting the food. We went for dinner. We got the \"My Wife's Eggplant Parm\" for the appetizer and it was AMAZING. It is pretty filling. For the entree, we got Chicken Rigatoni \"Alla Vodka\" and it's just WOW. The food was filling and tasty. I will definitely go back to it. The food is rich and creamy.

    "text": "The RJ did a review on this restaurant and I had no desire to visit until I read it.  We came for a late dinner on a Monday night. I didn't think we would need reservations. Walking down the hall, we were met with a huge line and I hoped it wasn't a dinner rush. I suddenly second guessed my decision to gamble on a walk in. We got closer and realized the crowd was for the bake shop located directly across the hall from the restaurant. Still, there was a good amount of people in front of the host stand. Turns out, Buddy and some of the guys were there! He was near the bar that was sectioned off for a private party, but it was still pretty cool to see them there none the less!  We were seated right away and really liked the decor and vibe of the place. Caleb was our server and he pretty much made our night. He offered bottled, sparkling, or tap water to start while we looked over the menu.  We started with Aunt Nina's Mozzarella en Carrozza as suggested by the RJ review and also by Caleb. Be sure to order this when you come! Think fried mozzarella, but done the way it should be. The outside provided a perfect crunch and the inside had all the ooey-gooey-ness you hope to find when you get fried mozzarella. It comes dressed with a tomato sauce and pesto sauce drizzle. After our first bite, we immediately contemplated ordering another. We held off as we planned on saving room for dessert.  My fiancee ordered one of the specialty cocktails as well. I don't remember which one..it had good flavor, but the alcohol was a little strong for her liking. Caleb was attentive enough to notice she wasn't drinking it and asked a couple times if she would like him to get her something else. Being in the service industry herself and not wanting to create more hassle, she declined and figured she would drink it with her entree. Caleb came over once more and took the glass and said he wanted to get her a glass of his favorite drink on the menu. He brought back a cocktail the was tequila based and had a sprig of rosemary. My fiancee doesn't care for tequila but I enjoyed the drink very much. We were very appreciative of Caleb's initiative to make our experience the best it could be.  My fiancee was torn between the chicken parm and the chicken rigatoni \"alla vodka\". Based on the descriptions and recommendations of our server, she went with the latter. I ordered the Agnolotti. The rigatoni was perfectly al dente and the sauce was very well prepared. The Agnolotti was so hearty from the flavorful meat filling and the brown butter sauce was a perfect compliment.   We somehow managed to save some room for dessert. My fiancee has a weakness for cannolis so her decision was made fairly quickly. I came in with the intention of ordering the XL lobster tail pastry. After the meal I just had, the \"XL\" part turned me off of that idea. I was torn between the birthday cake and the Nutella cake. I turned once more to Caleb for advice trusting he would once again deliver and not turn us astray. I ended up with the Nutella cake.  The cannoli was very flavorful and had a nice touch of cinnamon. It was served with a side of chocolate sauce. The Nutella cake was actually a lava cake. It was very moist which is often lost on such a dessert. It was served with a scoop of salted caramel ice cream which perfectly balanced the sweetness of the cake.  All in all it was a great experience. The dinner menu is a little bit smaller compared to other Italian restaurants, but if every item is executed well, who cares?? Be sure to ask for Caleb and be sure to order Aunt Nina's mozzarella. I am convinced that everything on the menu is delicious and we will definitely be returning to test that theory.",

Though if you go, hubby enjoyed the chicken parmesan, so give that a go.  We didn't stay for dessert, I wasn't feelin' it.  But the waitress was fantastic!  She was really polite and I noticed she had a rude customer and she kept smiling.  The drinks were okay, the bread was eh and the Cesar salad was heavily dressed, but wasn't bad.

The portions here are nice and the different types of dishes on the menu make it hard to decide what to order. Our server, Perry is fantastic! He checked on us often and made sure everything was to our liking. Managers, Adam and Christopher also stopped by our table at different times to introduce themselves and make sure we were enjoying everything. I could tell that not just the managers care about the experience of every customer, but the servers and rest of the employees do too.  The cost for the RW week dinner was $30.14 per person which I found to be a very fair price considering what I got. I had the following:  Buddy's Caprese  Chicken Parm & Spaghetti  Zeppole  The next day I at the following:  The meal started out with warm bread and oil and balsamic. Nice start!  Buddy's Caprese ($16) - This salad is sooooo good! It had charred green beans, burrata, tomatoes and balsamic. The variety of tomatoes and different colors of them were nice. The tomatoes tasted so fresh. The burrata was fantastic! So soft and tasted great.   Buddy's Salumi and Cheese Board ($21) - Prosciutto, spicy capicola, genoa salami, gorgonzola, pecorino, grana padano, pickled veggies, olives and grilled bread arranged beautifully on a cheese board. The meats had such great flavor and the olives (they contain pits) had a nice garlic flavor to them. All the cheeses were good, but the gorgonzola was my favorite. It was creamy and easy to spread on the garlic toast. Delish!  Chicken Parm & Spaghetti ($23) - This is oven baked with provolone and mozzarella. I thought mine from the night before was soggy, so I asked that it be cooked longer this time and it was just perfect. Nice and crispy were is should be and the cheeses tasted good. The spaghetti on the side had marinara on it and parmesan and even though I barely had room, I couldn't let it go to waste! I did take half of my chicken parm home and it reheated nicely.   Lisa's Warm Nutella Cake ($9) - The cake was warm and baked perfectly. It also came with a scoop of salted caramel ice cream that was excellent.   Zeppole ($9) - These are served hot and coated in a spiced sugar. 2 dipping sauces accompany them, lemon raspberry jam and chocolate. The raspberry jam I wasn't crazy about, but the chocolate dipping sauce tasted great.   They also have a kid's menu as well a lunch menu that offers burgers and sandwiches. I am eager to come back and check some of the sandwiches out. I was very pleased with the service, food and atmosphere. The first night, we sat at a table near the bar area next to a large window that overlooks the strip. The next night we sat at a booth that was closer to the kitchen. Both are different experiences so try them both! They also can host events here.",

    "text": "This was our second time visiting Buddy V's.  The first time I came was about a year ago with several other couples on an adult trip.  We celebrated a friend's birthday and we had the most amazing experience and an extremely attentive waiter.  Our waiter completely took care of us with a flat rate per person and an unending amount of food, all of which was incredible.  We enjoyed it so much that we've been planning for the past year to come back and bring our children so they could experience it for themselves.  On Friday evening, April 7, 2017, we had the opportunity to bring our children, however the experience fell short of what we'd been long anticipating.  In town for a volleyball tournament, our first Vegas dinner was at Buddy V's.  We had a party of 8 and were celebrating birthdays for two of the girls in the group.  Upon initially sitting down at the table, I placed my purse on the back of the chair, as I do in every restaurant.  I pulled the chair out to sit down and as I sat, I fell completely on the floor as the chair had tipped over.  My purse is not THAT heavy, but rather the chairs are incredibly lightweight and not durable.  The waiter attempted to help me up but made no offer to get me ice or to notify management.  He did ask if I was okay, but due to the embarrassment and humiliation of falling down in front of other patrons, I quickly said yes, even though my elbow was hurting.  Leaving the restaurant that night my right elbow hurt.  Saturday morning I noticed my right elbow was bruised in addition to another bruise on the back of my left arm.  With regard to the meal, my daughters ordered off the Dinner Prix Fixe menu where you get a salad, an entree, and a dessert for $40.  The girls split their meal.  When the bill came, our girls had been charged for each item they ordered according to the a la carte menu pricing, instead of the Dinner Prix Fixe menu and it was added to the other party's ticket instead of our own.  The waiter also expressed displeasure with having to split the bill for the table into two separate tickets, which should not have been shared with us.  We asked the waiter toward the end of the meal if they could sing to the girls for their birthdays and he notified us that they don't sing.  He offered instead to bring each of the girls a birthday cannoli.  What he failed to mention, however is that there would be an additional charge.  I would not have minded had he mentioned that before bringing the desserts out but rather I discovered the additional charge when I got my bill.  Feeling dissatisfied with our overall experience, I decided on Saturday evening to write this Yelp review but wanted in all fairness to first call the restaurant and speak with the General Manager to let her know of our experience.  I called at approximately 6:30--not the most ideal time to call, which I acknowledged but I felt it needed to be addressed before anymore time had passed.  She told me that anytime a customer falls in the restaurant, she is to be notified.  She mentioned she was there on Friday evening when I fell and no one made mention of my fall to her.  She asked for my email address and told me that the next time we were in Vegas just to email her and she would take care of everything.  It is now Sunday at 11:15 a.m. and I've not received an email or phone call from her.  Incredibly disappointing, especially with all the hype I've given to Buddy V's in anticipation of this trip.  We will be looking for a new location for Italian cuisine on future visits to Vegas.",

Both were delicious! We wish we would have split a dish though, because by the end of dinner we didn't have much room left for dessert, which look so dang good. Sad face. Next time we will definitely split a dish so that we can indulge in some yummy Italian dessert.",

    "text": "Wow! We wanted a place for Sunday Brunch that also offered bottomless drinks besides the standard champagne or mimosa. For an extra $15 each we had our choice of sangria, mimosas or pomegranate bellinis. Our waitress was wonderful and we certainly got our money's worth as our glasses were never empty.  The Buffet food ($35) was delicious too! There were several stations located throughout the main dining area. They included salads/appetizers, a carving station, kid's station and the dessert table. Entrees were lined up right next to the open kitchen and included Chicken Parm, meatballs, French Toast, scrambled eggs and a carbonara mac & cheese. Be sure not to miss the traditional mac & cheese at the kid's table which was the best we've ever tasted!! Also, get your protein fix with the delicious carved ham and chicken sausage.   The dessert table is, of course, not to be missed! We saw a line a mile long across the way at Carlos' Bakery on our way in and were looking forward to being able to sample some of those offerings. The cannolis and the bread pudding with fresh whipped cream and caramel sauce were the highlights at the Buffet. They also had big jars of bite-sized wrapped candy which made for a nice little treat later in our room at The Palazzo. Parking was a pain since Venetian/Palazzo are two of the last on the Strip who do not charge but Buddy's Sunday Brunch will definitely be on our repeat list for our next trip!",

This is one of the few restaurants on the strip that actually has real windows to the outside world (no fake ceiling here) which was refreshing. A little loud in the dining room - but then is Vegas known for being quiet?  We had: Salumi plate- salumi was terrific, cheeses better than average, olives OK Eggplant parm- on app menu & can be shared even though waitress said it was too small for sharing. Easily enough for 6 to share Scallopps- not very Italian, was it bacon? too over cooked but polenta & scallopps were perfect The lasagne was HUGE & very good. Kids chix parm was a large sized portion and excellent.  Chix marsala came with 3 pieces of chicken! Ceasar Salad was tastey but way over dressed. Very soggy. Ask for less dressing. With a bottle of wine & tip our meal for 6 was $300. Not an inexpensive night out so don't be misled by the lower $ on yelp.   Perfect if you have a mixed crowd & need something for everyone. Can't beat the Ventitian atmosphere either.",

I am not a fan of arugula, so I asked to have it on romaine (as they had a Caesar salad on the menu).  He asked the chef and the chef said no. I then said, can you just give me the Caesar salad and place a filet on it. He said sure. The entree came as follows... One plate with a filet (6oz) and one small bowl of Caesar salad. I asked what is this??? The server proceeded to tell me that the chef did not think a filet would go nicely on a Caesar. I told the server that I ordered the meal and not him. This really frustrates me. Cater to the customer, especially when this is a middle of the road restaurant. I also had (2) vodka and soda with a lime. The third one came with lemon. I asked why and where was my lemon. The server said that he did not want the drinks messed up? What?!? This place needs some flavor added to the meals, re-training of the staff and the chef to have a new attitude. I miss the First!!! The First was the restaurant prior.",

Its hard to share these dishes because they are more individual portions. The kale sald was very flavorful and good. I enjoyed the texture of the kale and it was way to eat. I didnt really like the rigatoni. I think it was undercooked because the rigatoni was hard and very difficult to chew. The sauce was good though. Our waiter was cool to talk to and welcoming. Nice to try because i do like buddy from cake boss, but I'm not planning to come back.",

After viewing the pictures, I had my heart set on the lasagna but the chicken parm also looked good so I asked the waiter what he would recommend.  He said both were good but since I was by myself, I should have the chicken parm because the lasagna was large enough to serve two.  Since I was there in time for their pre-show prix-fix menu, and chicken parm was on that, I went with that selection.  The Caesar salad had a nice dressing, not overly powerful.  The chicken parm was good but not so delicious that it made me not wish that I tried to lasagna instead.  I went with the chocolate hazelnut cake (can't remember the exact name) and that was delicious.  I really wanted to try the lobster tail, but it was not one of the options on the prix fix, but unlike the entree, I was not disappointed that I didn't have what I walked in intending to order.  Although the chicken parm was a bit disappointing, it wasn't bad, just nothing special.  I would go back to try the lasagna.",

We had a hard time finding it & even after asking an employee at palazzo they had no idea where it was! We called buddy v's and they directed us where to go. I was disappointed where they seated us, we had a seat facing the kitchen while the gorgeous view was behind us. I thought since we had a reservation& a bday to celebrate we should have been able to enjoy the view. The food definitely made up for the bad seat. My husband ordered the chicken Parmesan and I ordered chicken Marsala. Both were excellent, but the chicken Marsala was the best I've ever had. Service was awesome, no complaints there. Can't wait to go back!  Hopefully we'll have a better seat next time.",

I love your charisma, but unfortunately the food at your Las Vegas restaurant is very disappointing. ;( We came here on Dec. 24 to celebrate my daughters first birthday, this i will give you though, your staff is excellent! Great customer service and great ambiance! They were very accommodating and on top of things, Kudos on that! We ordered various things from desserts to appetizers, the most disappointing item was the veal, it tasted funky and it had a weird smell to it, so i returned it and they graciously took it off my bill. the tastiest item we ordered was the linguini with clams, but it wasn't amazing, the other items like calamari, osso buco, grilled cheese, was ok, but not great as well. The lobster tail dessert was just horrible, it was as hard as a rock! I am sorry to say that my expectations were a bit higher, especially since the menu was a bit pricey, but even if the menu was more reasonably priced, the taste was just not exciting my palate. I mean overall it was a fun time, I don't regret celebrating my baby's first birthday there, hey at least the baby loved the free bread sticks, but would I come back? Maybe if somebody else paid, i would be willing to give it another shot, also keep in mind that they just opened this location, and every restaurant will always have its growing pains, that's why these reviews are necessary.",

When we showed up I was automatically taken back by the lack of personality and sheer lack of respect from the hostess. I must have high standards seems how I work in a restaurant but I certainly would expect more from a restaurant of its caliber and popularity. We had no greeting, no hello, no nothing. When we were seated we were handed menus and we knew it was a bit pricy before we went so that wasn't a shocker. It's the Las vegas strip and you're paying for the name. But honestly for the price and because of the name I really pictured a warm, friendly atmosphere. Not a cold environment where we were treated like we intruded and were not welcome. I felt so sad for my daughter. She was excited to go there for the amazing experience she thought she'd have and to have my 12 year old on her birthday feel so let down and disappointed about the service is very disheartening. She felt like she was personally let down by Buddy himself. The food was good but when you feel so unwelcome, it ruins the entire experience. Such a bummer that the Bake Shop service wasn't any better either. Can't say I'll be going back and I Definately don't think this is how Buddy would want people to feel walking into his restaurant because he is such a family guy who's welcoming and makes it feel like home.",

I had the Chicken Parm, which was a huge portion and was a great dish I will enjoy for dinner too! The smashed meatball sub and the Salmon were ordered by the others in the party and all said they really enjoyed their dishes! We also got an order of the garlic bread which was the right amount of garlic and cheese! The service was good and nicely paced! Overall great experience, great food and I would recommend this place to others! Sadly we were too full to order dessert.",

    "text": "This restaurant was really great! I went with my family at 11:30 for brunch and was very satisfied with my experience. The restaurant is huge and the little details make it special. You can tell that it is inspired by Buddy's family which gives it a homey and comfortable feel. The coffee and food was fantastic as well as the service. We ordered the eggplant Parmesan, buddy's pizza, pasta carbonara, calamari, caprese, spaghetti and meatballs, and the tomato soup. Everything was so delicious and satisfying. The dessert menu was a nice touch as well because it is like a family photo album which I thought was a nice detail. Service was excellent and our wait staff was very attentive. We ordered in advance from Carlo's bakery and ate in in the restaurant along with our coffee. Overall this place was excellent and I will probably be back in the future.",

She was not pleasant and acted as if we and the table next to us was an annoyance. The servers' assistant however, was perfect! He was very polite and friendly, he took our drink order and kept them filled as well as boxed up my leftovers. The server took our food order (Hoboken Cheesesteaks - Delish!) but a runner brought our meals from the kitchen, she stood around leaning on the servers' station while we waited for our food and ate, then she turned around as if she were offended when I declined the dessert menu, then she literally dropped our check folio on the table. Yes, I realize they are famous for desserts with Carlo's Bakery across the hall but I had 2/3 of my meal boxed up because of the generous portions, we were stuffed! I hope they split the tips with the assistants because she was awful and the young man took very good care of us the entire meal, even my hubby commented several times about her demeanor and expressed that he wished the assistant was our actual server.",

We were staying at the Palazzo & let me tell you to not look any further!!!  The hostess enthusiastically escorted us to the sexy lounge area adjacent to the dining area. This is not your typical \"sit at the bar\" experience, it's more like a \"VIP club experience\" with stellar views of the strip. Our super friendly waitress made our experience memorable. The food is totally authentic grandma cooking & the prosecco is a delicious brut, not sweet. The drinks were $4 & the appetizers were $5.  Just as we couldn't drink or eat another bite, my husband was closing the tab & we quickly realized WTF are we doing turning down desert?? We are in the cake boss restaurant. As we were deciding between cannoli's or tiramisu, our adorable waitress suggested the Nutella cake with espresso ice cream. What a slice of heaven!!!!!!  As soon as the bubbly started to hit, an amazing jazz band ( The fabulous baker boys) arrived & blew us away with their great jazz/Italian hits. They were more than happy to accommodate requests. Dino, Frank, Bobby Darin, they know it!  The vibe reminded me of an old school Italian \"Goodfellas\" experience & because of that,  This is my new go to spot when I am in Vegas.  : ))",

    "text": "I'm a local and when friends came into town to attend a wedding (officiated by Elvis, no less) I suggested Buddy V's for a late lunch, even though I'd never been there before.   3pm is a perfect time to visit! It's slow in the restaurant, but the service is top-notch. They even had a specific menu for 3-5pm which was a-little-lunch-a-little-dinner. Here's what we chose and the consensus on each.  1. Meatball Sub and Fries: Good! large meatballs, delicious marinara and cheese, crusty bread, tasty fries that seemed almost batter dipped. I ate half so I'd have room for dessert.  2. Chicken Avocado Club Thingy: Good! The Caesar salad that came with it had what looked like croutons on top, but really they were a fried cube of something - we thought polenta - with a mildly lemony taste. Really added to the salad and surprised in a good way.  3. Margherita Pizza: Good! The person who ordered this enjoyed it a lot. I had a bite and thought it was good. One other person at our table thought it was horrible. Whatever. I'd still give it a solid B+.  4. The Meat and Cheese Board: Excellent! Our difficult-to-please patron got this and enjoyed it immensely. It had 4 kinds of Italian cold cuts, very fresh and very good, sliced thin. A few hunks of cheese (the Parmesan was to die for!) and some olives and other pickled veggies rounded it out. There was also some toasted bread.  Nobody finished any of their meal, and it was boxed and given back to us in a pretty bag with utensils and napkins for later.  We'd saved room for dessert and got the XL Lobster tail with fresh fruit, lemon sorbet, and the caramel creme brulee.  All of them were very, very good, but I've got to say that hands-down, that was the BEST creme brulee I've ever had. EVER. And I love creme brulee. And it wasn't even my dessert!  I'm not ashamed to say, I used my finger to get the last of the creme brulee out of the bowl. Well, maybe I'm a little ashamed.   The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that, while everything was good and fresh tasting; it lacked something. Very good, but not indistinguishable from other good Italian meals that I've had. I'd love to say \"there's nothing out there like Buddy V's\" but I can't. Yet.  I think I'll have to try again, just to make sure.",

    "text": "Where to start...  Location is awkward (end of a mostly deserted hallway) and was certainly of no help to former occupant FIRST Food and Bar.  Ambiance inside the restaurant itself is quite nice, although tables thrown in the hallway seem strange.  Outdoor seating is laughable and ill-conceived.  It's essentially at the top of an escalator leading up from Walgreens/down to the Strip so plenty of foot traffic will get to check-out your food.  The outdoor view is obstructed by a wall.  This area was never intended for restaurant seating and has emerged as a hot spot for Grand Canal Shoppes' employees to congregate and smoke.  Enjoy!  Service is slow and uninterested, perhaps even worse than FIRST.  Maybe the same staff?  A friend of mine said he and his date waited 15 minutes at an empty bar to be acknowledged, let alone served.  He was so aggravated they left without eating.  He's a bartender in the Venetian and understands the importance of timely service.  My experience wasn't much better.  My food was bland, we're talking CPK bland.  A penne dish was swimming in flavorless oil and assorted vegetables that looked to be left-over from some other dish and the chicken parm was just as bland.  Skipped dessert which was probably my mistake given that's the namesake's claim to fame.  Speaking of, who thought naming an Italian restaurant after a well-known PASTRY chef was a good idea?  I've already spent too much energy on this place.  Maybe it will improve and it seems others have had better experiences, but I won't give it a second go.",

They were all good and the portion sizes are great, but they weren't rave-worthy.  The service, however, was fantastic.

My fellow event planners and I wanted to escape the 3200 person conference we were working on and go somewhere without strobe lights and bass, so we came here.  I will start with the good:   The decor here is great.  It takes up a corner spot on the Canal Shoppes level and you have a view of TI, the Trump and the strip.  It's rustic and familiar.  Red checkered napkins and rustic wood tables with interesting lighting fixtures.  My favorite was the children's artwork on the walls and the family photos everywhere (especially the dessert menu).  The food was GREAT.  I had the Orechiette with Italian Sausage.  It was flavorful and satisfying.  It had a perfect balance of al dente pasta, savory sausage and broccoli and tomatoes.  I wasn't starving, but I ate ALL of it. My team had the spaghetti and meatballs, the Burratta Salad and the meatballs.  They ALL raved without exception.  If it only depended on food and decor, i would have been more generous with my rating.   However, for me, service trumps it ALL.   The not so good: Service was odd.  We arrived for our noon reservation and the restaurant was probably 1/4 full.  There were PLENTY of open booths that would have accommodated us perfectly, but the hostess decided on putting us at a table in the back.  Once seated we waited a bit to be greeted by our server, but he eventually showed and took our order.  Once orders arrived, we all seemed to receive what belonged to someone else.  Then we had an unfortunate situation that involved our waiter spilling ice cold lemonade all over someone in our party.  It was a mistake and I felt terrible for him.  But the problem was he didn't seem prepared for the situation.  He remedied it as best he could by getting help, some towels and eventually a staff tshirt for our young group member (which lucky for him was not someone in an expensive business suit).  At the end of our lunch he announced his apologies and included that his manager was so sorry about the situation that he would be sending over a dessert for the table.  Now I don't know about you, but once I was at BJ's restaurant and there was a spill at our table that hit a few of our shoes and the manager raced over, paid for our dinner AND offered to pay for our shoes and dry cleaning!  and that was at a chain pizza place!  I'm going to take a wild guess and say that if someone spilled ice cold anything all over one of Buddy V's kids, he wouldn't be so keen on getting a hard puff pastry filled with custard as an apology.  While the spill was the waiter's mistake, management could have comped her lunch or at least her drink -- which he still charged us for!     Unfortuantely, this is what I will remember most about my time at Buddy V's.",

    "text": "Took my chic here last night for her birthday because she heard Buddy on 98.5 and asked if we could go, so off we went. I have been to the best places in Vegas and some are over hyped and some under hyped. I went into Buddy V's not really thinking anything was gonna be all that amazing but I was wrong on a few things.  One, The mussels they have are the best mussels I have ever eaten in my life. The mussels were so good I ordered another order after dessert.  Two, The surf and turf I ordered was cooked to perfection.  Three, The XL Lobster dessert is probably one of the most amazing things on this planet.  I love to watch new restaurants as they open just to see who really has their shit together and I think Buddy V's did a pretty good job on their opening. Staff was nervous and If I worked there I would be too. Not only is it opening day but the owner, owners business partners and the owners parents are all there.   We were greeted by Adam Margolies who is the asst G.M. and it was really great to talk to a guy who is really into the property enough to where he had an answer for every question. I know to people reading this that may not seem like much but being from Vegas it is really hard to find knowledgeable people that know things even at the places were they work. We asked him how the XL lobster is made, where the cuts of beef were farmed from, if the scallops are flown in or driven, if the broccoli is organic, if the chocolate chips in the Gelato was made from scratch or store bought.  We asked all these questions and he answered all of them with no hesitation.   The decor is 10/10 for the type of restaurant it is and I think it will do well here in Las Vegas. I love eating at places that don't feel stuffy as I don't believe you should ever feel uncomfortable anywhere in Las Vegas.  Welcome to Vegas Buddy V!! Your gonna do great here and we are glad you chose Vegas to serve. Gonna get more mussels now !",

They even adjusted my billing so that it can be billed to the room at The Palazzo which can earn my points towards my status. We really wanted to like the Tiramisu but it can be better.  Fine option if you are looking to spend a lazy day not doing much.",

    "text": "We just finished doing some engagement photos at Venetian, and decided we wanted to try some Italian nearby. Buddy V's had good reviews, so why not?  On one hand, we were incredibly impressed with the quality of the food. We're accustomed to plain-jane low-budget Italian restaurants (that many people scoff at even calling Italian) like Olive Garden. Buddy V's was accommodating and everything we tried was exquisite. They even made a custom Alfredo sauce for me that they don't have on their current menu.  I had the eggplant parmesan with added Alfredo, as well as the cheesy garlic bread and a caesar salad. The eggplant was perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy and full on the inside. And the Alfredo was to die for, especially since I had been craving it so bad. And their caesar salad had croutons made of polenta! Definitely never had that before! It reminded us of tofu at first, but we knew it couldn't be. So good! The fiance also was in love with his lasagna but had devoured way too much bread for sure beforehand, and whined that he couldn't finish the size. Haha.   The downsides of this place is that it was busy, so we ended up having to ask for our own complimentary bread and balsamic/olive oil dip that only about half the restaurant was getting. Also we got sat next to this horrendous couple that were so weird and probably bored with their lives that they sat there discussing and making fun of us like we wouldn't be able to see and hear them. Not really Buddy V's fault, but it dampened my experience.  If I'm remembering right,  they have 7-days-a-week happy hour. That's always a plus for any restaurant!",

I ordered the class spaghetti with meatballs (on Yelp, the meatballs seem to be a highly rated item). The texture of the meatballs was strange. They were not soft and didn't fall apart easily as you bit into it, how I usually imagine good meatballs to be. My friend ordered the chicken Parmesan. The portion of chicken was HUGE, but again nothing special. My friend thought it was ok. The food reminded us of what you would get at Bucca di Beppo or Olive Garden, that exact quality. All in all, I definitely appreciated the great service but giving this 3 stars solely because of the food :(",

They offer a lunch special menu with Gr8 selections 3 courses $22.00 soup/salad, main & dessert, not including drinks      Started with the Caesar salad, which is killer~ the croutons are deep fried corn meal & the creamy dressing is not over whelmed by anchovies . My gf had a spinach salad beautifully presented w/ red cherry tomatoes, red onions, grated parmesan.      Main courses ~ mine was the spaghetti Bolognese, flipping fantastic!!!!! The sauce or gravy depending where your from is \"Outta Site!\" My gf had the salmon generous portion (cooked to perfection) over sauteed veggies, again both were beautiful to look at and tasted equally DEEEELISH!!!!!!    Dessert ~ I had tiramisu, excellent with a cappuccino & my gf has the raspberry sorbet with coffee .    All in all just a great stop and quite good for the kiddos too!!!",

No we're sorry we sucked how about a dessert. Nothing. Waiter hovered while we filled out a comment card. Manager disappeared. Found a hostess who was giving a free dessert to another table for their inconvenience. All in all. Don't go there not worth it. Price high. Value low. Food mediocre. Service terrible. Will not return and will tell all to avoid. For a much better meal go to Viva Las Arepas!",

    "text": "Maybe I expected a lot more because of the name behind it. I Have to admit I was pretty excited to try this place out and not that I was disappointed but more so I wasn't wowed or left with a \"can't wait to come back\" feeling. A couple friends were in town and like any vegas visitor wanted to try something new. We came for Sunday brunch and instead of ordering off the regular menu they offer a Sunday brunch buffet. Though the selection was more than enough to fill me up, don't expect a lot of food (the idea most might get when thinking of a vegas buffet).  The food was ok. Nothing spectacular but very well presented. First time ever seeing dragonfruit and lychees (served in original shell and \"hair\") in a restaurant so that was new for me. Disappointment #1 for the price you are kind of better off checking out one of the other casino buffets.  The restaurant itself was cute, family like and had a really open feeling. Love the concept of the open kitchen!   As for service, this would be disappointment #2. Our server sold us the idea of unlimited drinks for an upgrade (of course) but the fact we only saw him 2 times our entire visit, limited the drinks we could order. We had to ask our busser on 3 different occasions for more water. Plus side though the bloody mary bar was pretty neat, lots of hot sauce options, vegetables and additions to choose from...good touch! We could tell they were a bit short handed since we only saw 3 servers (from what we could tell) covering the entire floor and they were fairly busy.  So we cut him some slack because he was very nice.   Hostess staff was a little rude and not very personable but our interaction with them was short enough to make it tolerable.   We wanted to visit the bakery but the line was so long we decided against it. I'm a local so not sure I would visit again unless visitors from out of town really want to go, but even then I might suggest another spot.",

We overall spent 3 hours to be seated, get our food, and eat.  The restaurant wasn't very busy to have waited that long either. The food was fine but I didn't think it was worth it for the price.",

Kids leaving their table and running around the place -- not the fault of the establishment, but not the way I prefer to dine.

    "text": "I recommend stopping here if you want some Italian, in Las Vegas. It's located by the Shops in the Venetian.  We both got the Prix Fixe and it was so good! It seemed a little pricey at $40/person, but for what you get, it's better deal than you would think at first glance.   The complimentary bread they bring for you to dip in oil & vinegar is as a type of a focaccia, so delicious. I don't care for Balsamic vinegar, so the waitress kindly brought some marinara for me, and that sauce was perfect. I chose the panzanella side salad, which was so huge and packed with goodness. They didn't just throw some salad mix on a plate! Very fresh, croutons made in-house and packed with flavor. The cheese, the tossed-in dressing, all in perfect proportion to the greens. Also noted that they halved the grape tomatoes, which is a sign to me that they pay attention to detail. (I love the taste, but hate biting into a whole grape tomato and having it burst.)   As entree, I had the Bucatini Carbonara, which is a dish I am super picky about, and it was the best I've ever had! Pasta was perfect and I could have easily saved half, if I was a little less hungry, or it was less delicious. As it was, there was such a generous portion, I didn't finish it.   My guy had Orecchiette and Italian Sausage. It looked lovely, and had some red peppers, broccolini, roasted tomatoes, and the spicy Italian sausage. Really, all the flavors he loves. I tried a bite, and it was fantastic.   The wine  Paolo Scovino Dolcetta d'Alba 2013- was great pairing with pasta, just enough sweet and mild acidity and richness to be a wonderful accompaniment to the meal. It's a variety I hadn't tried before, so I have a new love.   Tiramisu was beautiful and flavorful, not too much of any of the ingredients, and a couple of lady fingers on the side. My guy finished his cannoli in about 3 minutes, as well, so I'm assuming he liked it.   All in all, Excellent! We were stuffed and happy, and the service was attentive and friendly.",

Croutons on the Caesar salad were warm polenta croutons. Yuk! The rigatoni was overcooked bag rigatoni. The meat was over done. The sauce had zero flavor. Notably the pasta and the meat had two different sauces. That seems kind of strange since typically you would use the meat sauce on top of the pasta.

This is the first time I have stopped by in years after claiming they have the best tiramisu. It was so HUGE. And now.....it comes in a mini mason jar.   I understand businesses have to make money, but some dishes and desserts have become painfully small and remained at expensive prices, which is just plain sad.   Furthermore, they try to trick you into paying for water now. Instead of offering tap water like they used to, they get rid of the option in their speech.  --SO if you DON'T want to pay for nestle water, and they say \"Still or Sparkling?\"...SAY TAP. Don't pay for water unless you really want to. Because that is just a damn waste of $10 folks.   They never used to trick me before, so I was totally not expecting this. I can't even rate them like I normally do, because I was so mad.   The big points are:  1) Their food is just average, so just skip it.  2) The dessert is the better part of the meal, so if you want some, just go to Carlo's Bakery.  3) They do have really good service, but they tricked me, so that was a little messed up since they didn't used to do that. It's totally what you expect restaurants that serve $80 per head to do. If you're going to do that, can't you at least do it during the more expensive dinner time?  I'm pretty mad, so it'll be a while when I come back, if ever.",

My water was not getting refilled and easily 30 min of our time got wasted for lack of management.  If you want customers to come back hire more staff and be professional, you also impact the poor staff by getting less tip and more work load.  When someone comes to your restaurant expects great experience  2- the food was good but there was so much fat in the chicken...   The reason i give it a two star is because of friendly staff.

You choose a starter, entree, and dessert.  Hubby got the meatballs and I got the Caesar salad.  The meatballs we so freaking moist! And the sauce was perfect!  The salad...probably some of the best dressing I have ever had and the polenta croutons! OMG!  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, so yummy!  Then for our entree hubby got the carbonara and I got the chicken parm.  Both were amazing!  Pasta was cooked perfectly, the carbonara was creamy and rich, the chicken was moist and crispy, just...yes!  And then there was dessert.  I couldn't even finish my meal so we got the warm Nutella cake there and the cannoli to go.   The Nutella cake with ice cream was like heaven on a plate!

Stay away from this place, they are not handling their seafood properly and unfortunately most everyone going there is a tourist so they don't have to survive on repeat customers.

Family photos of the Valastro family, hodgepodge furniture, comfy sofas and chairs...only thing missing is the vinyl and plastic covers, but honestly who misses them?   Teaming up with Kim Canteenwalla & Elizabeth Blau, who have created beautiful restaurants here in Vegas (Society Cafe + Honey Salt), the trio came together to make the Cake Bosses culinary debut a real knockout, start to finish.   I went with my Italian buddy to try it out and we were really impressed (to say the least)! Straight forward and diverse food menu, doesn't overwhelm; drink menu follows the pattern of the food menu with good wine choices by the glass.  I chose the agnolotti which was seasoned perfectly and was in season with the sage brown butter sauce. My buddy went to spaghetti central with a rigatoni and meatball bowl and he couldn't hold back the tears knowing the impending rejection his mother would give him after finding a better meatball.   The meatballs came really really really close to beating my Italian grandmother's secret recipe, but that leads to a lifetime of questions and heartache on my nonna. So, its easier to say that grams are better and avoid the remaining years of rejection by telling her a little white lie.  Dessert was the highlight (as expected) as my Tiramisu was not only flavorful but semi deconstructed as the lady fingers were on the side that you could dip into the cake and creme combo. My friend's salted caramel ice cream came loaded with bits of dark chocolate and an awesome biscotti.  If the restaurant wasn't in the Venetian/Palazzo's Grand Canal Shoppes: A) It would be way busier and the menu prices wouldn't be so high; and B) it wouldn't have awesome floor to ceiling windows facing the strip that make the space even more visually enjoyable.
