    "text": "Great restaurant if you want to get off the strip.  Food was authentic and delicious - definitely ask about the specials - pork dish and fig appetizer were the best.  Veal Piccata on the regular menu was best I've ever had.  Service was stellar from the moment we walked in the door.  One of the best cappuccinos I've had at a restaurant. Only negative is be prepared for a $35 cab ride each way but DEFINITELY worth the trip.  In fact if you factor in the cab fare to the total cost of the meal, it's probably not any more expensive than going to an upscale Italian restaurant on the strip.",

The food has always been delicious, as well as authentic and freshly made meals. The service is excellent as well! I love the ambiance here, and the fact that its run by a sweet italian family!! It kinda reminds me of being home I think :) The son is usually our server, but last night i took the BF out to dinner on date night the dad came over to say hello, explain the specials, and the wine list....the BF isnt the biggest wine drinker so he helped us pick out a bottle that he and I would both enjoy, and i have to say we both thought it was delicious!  I try to make myself get something different each time I eat here because everything is always so good, but I am so in love with the gorgonzola gnocchi....i think about it every day I'm dieting!!! haha...  Its really nice to see a REAL italian, family-run restaurant in the area...I hope they continue to do good business!!",

The thing that turned me off most about my experience was the automatic 30% gratuity that was added to my bill for a small party of 2!. Also the manager brought our bill to us before we had even received our dessert! Her reply was oh well the dessert's on the bill so it's ok. Well no problem for us, an automatic gratuity let alone a 30% one made it an easy choice not to come back here. The food was good, but a rather limited menu, though it had everything I'd be interested it. Price were a bit high for what you get too. In all I don't appreciate being told what tip they deserve specially if it's going to be 30% for two people, especially what parties over 8 have an 18% gratuity. Total rip off!!",

Service was great and attentive but not overbearing.  We started with ice teas and appetizers of Brietta and figs stuffed with goat cheese.. Only 3 figs so we had to split the last one (otherwise a fight)  delicious.  Mr. had the spaghetti and meatballs, normally he would have never ordered spaghetti but the meatballs made up for it.. large and absolutely delicious.  I had mushroom ravioli, light and creamy and not overpowering. The dining room was busy for 530p on a Wednesday night but service was still there.  I presented the groupon and when they brought the bill explained 18% tip was included. Nothing was hidden.  So after the groupon and the tip we still owed another 42.00 which was worth it.  The hostess did come over to bring change back (which we declined) and also said another groupon was out as of today 9-12.. Went home and bought another groupon.  A real gem found in a strip mall.",

It seemed like a family run business and the owners (husband and wife) were very present. The service was EXCELLENT. There were a ton of specials but you can tell the servers are trained to preface that. My husband and I both ordered off the specials and were very pleased with our meals. The portions are generous.  We are from CA but strangely enough, my husband had friends that were also dining there at the same time! One of them emailed my husband a coupon for Gaetano's and we showed it to our server and he gladly honored it. I love how you can flash coupons from your phone these days! :) Is it the best Italian meal ever? No. Is it great family run Italian restaurant? YES!! It's definitely worth a trip to Henderson. Yes, I would go again.",

So, we came with a coupon that was buy one entree, get the second entree for half price. The food is good, no complaint there. Then when we were presented with the check, the waiter did not add the coupon, so the owner came to the table and said, \"You people come here with a coupon, you don't eat an appetize, you didn't even drink any wine....don't ever come back to my place again.\"  I have never been treated so badly by anyone, anywhere, ever. Then, the owner followed us out to the parking lot yelling at us and once again, said, \"Get the FU%& out of here and don't ever come back.\" You simply can not make this stuff up. Countless people I know who have dined here have gotten a very cold and rude experience as well. Below, they describe the wife who is like a gate keeper. SHAME ON THE OWNER FOR TREATING PEOPLE SO BADLY. IF YOU TREATED PEOPLE WITH RESPECT, YOU WOULN'T HAVE TO GIVE OUT COUPONS TO BRING PEOPLE THROUGH YOUR DOOR. ALSO, IF YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE USING GROUPONS OR COUPONS, STOP OFFERING THEM. THESE PEOPLE ARE HORRIBLE.",

We were seated and it took quite a few minutes for the busser to come. He acted annoyed when I said regular water was OK instead of bottled. The same annoyed busser brought bread and slammed it down on the table. My husband said it was great though. Our food came reasonably quickly. It was a very modest portion. I am on a fairly strict diet and my appetite is not currently huge. I ordered chicken picatta. It was good, but not great. It was what I call a showgirl portion. After I ate every bite I was still hungry and could have gone elsewhere after. My husband order chicken parm. He said it tasted good, and the sauce on the pasta was great. But the chicken was soggy. He was not full or satisfied after dinner either. We had 2 chicken entrees and 2 glasses of wine. The bill was $68 before the tip. rather pricey to leave still wanting something else. It was OK, but as usual in Vegas there will be no return.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that the ONLY reason this restaurant is getting three stars from me is because the food was actually good. If I rated the service, they would not even get one star.   We had tried this restaurant when it first opened so many years ago, but had not been back since...until last night. My husband made reservations through <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Freservations.com&s=ab39badc028a4acadcb3d24d703fb765cefc42a832381bdc2df5ca59f3013cd7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">reservations.com</a>, and asked for a quiet, corner table as we were celebrating our anniversary. Our reservations were for 6:45 PM and the place wasn't very crowded at the time. After arriving, a waiter greeted us as he was stretching over to assist the people at another table. He grabbed a couple of menus and seated us (didn't ask if we had a reservation). Therefore, we were seated at a table between a couple with an irritable young child and a group of people that were pretty loud. We had to talk above normal levels just to hear each other. After being ditched by our waiter, we were finally served bread and water. More waiting as we are basically sitting, there as our waiter was tending to the tables around us, passing us by, barely glancing at us. This was the theme throughout the night.   We finally got our appetizer (delivered by a different server), which was a very good antipasto platter. Perfect for two people and had very good flavors. Our main courses were equally as good. I had a homemade butternut squash ravioli in a brown butter sage sauce. It was excellent. My husband had their pork special, which he enjoyed as well. I do have to give compliments to the chef. We would have had dessert (since it was a special occasion), but the 45 minute wait after we finished eating was just a little annoying. Again, our waiter walked by us several times, not looking at us, just tending to his other customers. Oh, the owner or manager did come over to us and said our last name with a question like he was confirming our reservation. Then he left and the next time we saw him was to ask for our check.   We decided to go have our anniversary dessert at Crepe Shack and Waffles...much better service!   Will we go back...probably not. There are too many good Italian restaurants in Henderson to try that have much better service.",

I would have rated it outstanding two years ago, good last year, and below average currently.  The calamari appetizer was rubbery, came out only luke warm, with a very mundane sauce.  My veal parmigiana, while adequate, was really quite ordinary and forgettable.  My wife ordered the fish special and was quite disappointed.  The service was adequate, but spotty.  We requested additional bread, was told it was coming, but it never arrived.  I was treating two additional friends for dinner, so I asked them to bring me the check.  Instead a different person dropped it off next to my friends, which was embarrassing.  It turned out to be the check for a different table.  When they brought the correct check, they once again dropped it off my my friends, forcing them to have to awkwardly hand it to me.  I also resent having an 18% tip added for a party of four--not because of the amount, as I would tip this much or more anyway if the service were good, but because it is insulting.  I doubt that we will be back any time in the foreseeable future.",

I really wanted to like the place because it would be nice to have off the strip options for a decent meal but I have to say that it was underwhelming. The food itself was not bad but it wasnt anything special either. I think some more imagination and flavor would go a long way.   Worse than that, the portion sizes were just small. $12 for a crab cake appetizer, I'd expect to see two crab cakes not just one little one in the middle of the plate.   My venison dish was fine but only maybe 4 or 5 slices (small slices) of Venison on top of a scoop of Risotto? For $38? To me that's even worse than strip prices. Maybe it was that way for Valentine's Day but shocking as it is, it's much better value for the money to go down to Buddy V's or to Maggiannos and the food at either place is much better, too.",

We did not choose the expensive items on the menu, sticking with the ravioli and pasta entrees. We all had the caesar salads and only ordered 2 wines and 2 beers,   We agreed the meals were tasty enough, but on the small side.   We shared 2 desserts between us.  The bill came to over $200.  If you can afford it, this is a nice place with good food.",

    "text": "Restaurant Week (2013)  I forgot my phone when I came here.  :(((((     While waiting to be seated, Nick the bartender made me an awesome Manhattan.  I'm not sure if Lisa being with us had anything to do with that but it was better than what I had the night before.  Was it made with rye whiskey perhaps??  The owner welcomed us when we sat, I love it when they do that!  But our first course the arugula was missing so he substitute it with another greens but the nut, fruit, and dressing was still delish.  I left my phone at home.  :(  I was trying to listen for it on my way there with the chance I might have dropped it but no.  The next course I thought was a red velvet ravioli it was so good.  But the stuffing inside the ravioli were beets!  The brown butter sage sauce was perfect for this pasta dish.    Because I lost my phone I wasn't entirely lost, 215 and Eastern is my favorite intersection in Las Vegas (technically Henderson) so I had an idea where it was without having Google Maps by my side.  My main entree was the veal sorrenta.  You had two other choices of a sole fillet (Christina gave me her remaining fish and it was so good!) and a chicken breast dish.  My veal sorrenta came with a layer of grilled eggplant, melted bufala mozzarella, veggies, and potatoes.  This was a solid restaurant week choice, $50 with $5 going towards charity.   Thank you Gaetano's for participating in restaurant week!    Even if I'm 30 mins late next time I'm never leaving my phone behind!",

Had a groupon to use, my friend and I were dressed casual, when we arrived we felt slightly under dressed to sit in the dining area (I'm sure they wouldn't have mind but out of respect for the owners who were walking around) we decided to sit at the bar. It sat about 10-15 people, had two TV's, dark lighting with candle on the bar, a friendly bartender and a large wine list and specialty cocktail list. The bread basket was filled with soft, tasty bread and a side of oil AND vinegar (I appreciate it when balsamic is added to the olive oil). We ordered the prosciutto stuffed figs with arugula that went perfectly with my Sauvignon Blanc, it was delicious. The menu was extensive, filled with the usual Italian favorites, one in particular, cioppino, which I will come back to try. When the bill came, our bartender informed us that an 18% gratuity is automatically added to the bill PRIOR to the discount, which I don't think is a big deal like other people have complained about in other reviews, I'm sure it's to help prevent the cheap skates from not tipping properly. If you read your Groupon you would see prior to purchasing it, it states it plain and simple. Will definately return.",

I had the veal and my wife had butternut squash ravioli. My veal and pasta were good but I was overwhelmed with the amount of grease. My wife's really enjoyed her ravioli but the was nothing else on the plate. The service was pretty good. Almost too good. Every other sip of my drink, there was someone filling it up. We lost track of how many people were coming to our table. It was a bit much. The thing that upset me was the bill. We had a $40 Groupon and the bill was about $55. They added a group gratuity of almost ten dollars to the bill. I would have tipped way more than the $10 because that's what you do when you use a Groupon. When someone adds a tip because you use a coupon, that's their tip. Too bad for them. Overall a decent restaurant will decent service and food. This must not be a very popular restaurant if they are using Groupon and then telling money from their customers. I will not be returning to this establishment. Overall, an ok restaurant. Decent service and decent food. The price",

The ciappino was not like the ciappinos that I have had before.  This was more like a linguini with mixed seafood.  It was very good.  My husband and I went there using a Groupon, and we found out that an 18% tip is added on to all groupon (and other coupons).  That made our $20 worth only $8.  I am usually a good tipper, however the service didn't warrant 18%.  When we confronted the owner, she told us her waiters do not want to work for nothing.  Maybe she should hire better waiters.  We will not return because of this - and no, it is not the money - it is a $2 difference between the tip I would have left and what I had to leave.",

We had a groupon for $40 and even with it, the bill was $70-something for 2 people.  It was definitely overpriced and not at all worth it.  We used to go to Carluccio's before it closed and would have the same quality meal for $50.  2. The server was weird.  While he was taking our order he kept looking up and toward the front doors to see who was coming in...really?  Are we not special enough?  Is it too much to ask to pay attention to your customers as they are ordering??  3. There were like 30 specials and the menu already had 100 items on it.  It wasn't really 30 specials, but it was too many.    4.  All over the menu there are things printed like, \"split salad charge\" and \"split meal charge\" and \"substitution charge.\"  Ok, we get it, you like to nickel and dime your customers...very tacky, especially when you are charging those astronomical prices.    Sadly, another italian joint off our list.  We have yet to find the perfect one in Vegas.",

    "text": "My husband and I frequent this place; we go once or twice a month on the average.  Gaetano's is great Italian food with an excellent wine list.  Best of all, Gaetano's is in our neighborhood!  The food has great flavor. Meats are always served to our desired doneness. Seafood and poultry items on the menu are juicy and tender. Pasta is cooked al dente while the sauces always make me want to lick my plate clean!  I love listening to their specials although you can't go wrong ordering from the menu. I recommend the burrata, the baked artichoke stuffed with Parmesan (an occasional special), the mushroom soup (also a special) and caprese for starters, the Mezzelune di Vitello con Porcini for pasta, and the Ossobuco alla Milanese for your entree, the tiramisu for dessert paired with THE cappuccino (not the regular one but the owner's own recipe).  Then again, like I said, you can't go wrong with any item from the menu.  I most especially like the feeling that the restaurant exudes.  You can certainly feel the welcome from the family that runs the place. The service is very personal. Nick who is often our server, treats us very well.  I also enjoy small talks with his father who is usually the host for the evening when he comes around to the tables. The floor plan and lighting make you feel cozy. It is not too small as to constrict you nor is it too big that it loses the intimacy.  I can come in shorts and flip-flops or in a little black satin dress and I'd be fine.  They send you a gift certificate for a free dinner to celebrate your birthday which is redeemable within your birth month. They often email you discount coupons too.  Occasionally, the restaurant will have set dinner menu pairing events hosted by wineries which are well worth the price because they are often generous with their pours and with pour refills.  From appetizers to desserts, Gaetano's is a hearty meal for its value. You pay not only for the quality and the decent sized portion of food, but also for the service, and the ambiance.",

You get $50 off but need to spend $100.    My advice is to wait when they offer 80 or 90% off the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> offer.  Normally you can get the $50 coupon for $20 but they offer discounts and then you can get it for just a couple bucks.  Onto the review....  I love this place because of the food and service.  You really feel at home and it does not feel stuffy.   The owner comes by and talks to you about the dishes and gives every table attention.    We ordered  the following:  Carpaccio di manzo con arugula - Thin slices of raw beef tenderloin with arugula, parmesan cheese, and EVOO.  This was very light and fresh.  Butternut squash Ravioli with Brown butter and Sage  - Very fresh...pasta had that nice bite in texture and the sauce was the boss.  You can also order a smaller portion which is what we did so these were our 2 apps.  Branzino Served Tableside - This was one of the off-the-menu items.  As stated in previous reviews, the restaurant typicaly has 8-10 daily specials.  I recommend def ordering one of them up.  The fish was simple but fresh and good.  A little lemon, EVOO brings out the freshness and taste of the fish.    Ossobucco served on saffron risotto - the best dish i ve had in months.  so much flavor and you can tell some old lady's been slaving away cooking it in a dutch oven to get all the nice, juicy flavor.  You don't need a knife for the shank and it's so rich but worth it.  The risotto is perfectly cooked.  To round it out, we ordered a side of broccoli rabe, tiramisu (awesome!), coffee, and with tax and tip we were out the door for just under $80.  For the quality of food and service, the meal would have been close to $200 on the strip, but with the coupon we had a great time for a very reasonable price.  We'll be back fo sure!",

Had the Waiter taken our coupons when we offered them to him at the beginning of service, we all could have avoided the embarrassment and humiliation we endured.  The so called Mrs. Manager /Hostess was rude, and both Mgr. and Waiter continued to act inappropriately by returning to our table to voice their opinions to us. In addition, the Waiter placed an 18% service charge (mind you we are only a party of 4) on our check, assuming that he deserved it. Two more negatives: 1). The 7 up we ordered, was never replaced as the BAR ran out of 7 up-it was 5 pm when the restaurant opened that they ran out of soda?  2). The restaurant did not serve fresh grated Parmesan cheese. That was shocking considering the price point and the theme of the restaurant indicating Italian food served.  Not a great Christmas Dinner experience!",

A good friend of mine recommended this place to me when I asked to venture out to an italian restaurant that wasn't part of the Vegas strip and I'm glad he did. Don't let the location fool you because its part of a strip mall next to buffalo wild wings and across from a jewelery store, because once you step in the restaurant the ambiance is warm and if the noise level is right, even couple friendly.   We started our dish with an appetizer (half order) of veal ravioli. Just the earthiness of the creamy mushroom sauce that accompanied the ravioli dish was very silky that when we had finished the raviolis, we sopped up the remaining of the sauce with our bread....it was that good!  Oh on the bread, it taste freshly made.  For our entree we shared Osso Bucco dish on a bed of safron risotto. The entree portion size here was big and enough for two individuals to share. The Osso Bucco was infused in a deep rich spices and cooked to the point that no knife, not even a butter knife is required. You litterally can cut the meat with your fork or spoon. The Meat on the Osso Bucco was very velvety and taking a spoonful of that with the saffron rissoto made the dish.   Oh! I can't forget the marrow that is with the osso bucco, if you don't want to eat it with the rest of the dish, spoon it on some of the bread and its like buttery patte.   As I am writing this review, a week later from our trip to Vegas, my mouth is still watering over this dish....and craving for some osso bucco.",

    "text": "Recommended by a local, this place is feels very authentically Italian.  Though the situation did not allow us to partake in wines, it seemed like there was a decent selection.  For starters, we had the wild mushroom soup and a burrata cheese caprese-like appetizer.  Both very good, but the wild mushroom soup was fantastic.    For main courses, we had the papardelle and the parchment steamed whole fish.  The whole fish had a show with the chef coming to the table to debone the fish for us.  It was a fun affair, but being asian and eating whole fish all my life, I could have probably deboned it better.    All in all, the price was reasonable, the service friendly, and the food memorable.  Definitely a place to try outside the typical Vegas fare.",

It is tucked in the corner of this shopping area but once you walk through the doors you may forget where you are...for a little while. The service is excellent, our waiter Nick was superb! We started with an appetizer of grilled portobello.... enough for two to share. My husband had eggplant and I had veal ravioli. My dish was excellent, fresh and well flavored.  And even though I was totally full ....I had to have the cannoli, which was very impressive. The shell was light and crisp with a light ricotta cream. We will definitely be back again!",

We have 3 kids under 7yrs old and they were pretty excited about the place but then when they were seating us the person seating us yelled at our kids and said that they needed to quite down but for us our kids weren't very loud compared to those who were in the restaurant yelling swear words drunk. Hype person who seated us said to our kids there is no yelling, no cursing and no getting crazy. I was furious but didn't make a statement because I know our kids wouldn't do that and they know not to be rude and yell out bad words. They were being kids excited to eat. Like said, food was great but probably not was a great idea taking kids.",

We had a 745 reservation didn't receive our food till 9. We ordered the ravioli and there was almost no filling(they were almost flat). They were only kinda warm. We asked the waiter if we could get different ones. Which he said of course no problem. Then all of a sudden the owner comes to table yells at us that is how they make the ravioli and no one has ever complained about them. We then decided to leave. Left $20 on the table for the waiter since it wasn't his fault. The owner then followed us outside, yelled at us again that no one has ever complained about his ravioli and don't ever come back. I am so upset over this whole thing. I have never been treated with such disrespect in my life.",

But once inside, it's actually modern, sophisticated, elegant, and even a bit fancy. But don't worry, most everyone patronizing was still dressed casual.  The wait staff were very professional, attentive, and courteous. The menu and wine list are both fairly extensive. And the list of daily specials was pretty extensive too. So many decisions!  I opted to listen to my fellow Yelpers and get the gnocchi gorgonzola. I don't usually go for gnocchi, but I definitely love gorgonzola. It was divine! Fabulously perfect gnocchi. And very rich and creamy sauce. And so incredibly filling. I took over half of it home. And it was still delicious reheated.  All in all, my friend and I had a very enjoyable dining experience with some very delicious pasta dishes. And it's only like 5 minutes from my house. So I will most definitely be returning.",

I really value the consistent quality, variety (especially with all their nightly specials), friendly service, and intimate atmosphere of this restaurant. It's places like these that make working out all week worth it just so I can stuff my face here every so often.  I know the list of nightly specials can be a bit daunting as it's a long list recited by the waiter, but I strongly recommend giving it a try - it truly has their best dishes. Among the many great specials, my faves are the mushroom soup, filet tip papardelle, cioppino, stuffed veal chop, duck breast, and pork bracioli. I do love the butternut squash ravioli off the regular menu - their preparation here is one of the better ones I've had anywhere - and sometimes I'll go with the classic veal parm. But usually with all the rotating goodies on the specials list, there's just something too good there to pass up.  Don't forget to save room for dessert. The special espresso which comes with a touch of liquor is a great way to finish off the meal, too.",

We all agreed that once the server was aware that we were using a coupon, the smiles and quick service began to decline. Our server had one of those keep calm and chive on Mustashes \"Ironic Handlebar\" which was adorned with the classic Ben Folds Glasses. Each of us ordered a desert and the special, so it wasn't like we went to order bread, water, and skedaddle. Anyway, the food here is some of the best I've had in Vegas. The server could use some pointers in Italian hospitality. It was one of those situations where you tell the waiter that you both will be sharing the dish and he slowly repeats what you said in a judgemental tone. We still left him a tip large enough to fill his belly with some PBR and maybe enough left over to save up for a Fixie.",

    "text": "If I could give them no stars I would. This was my 2nd experience at this restaurant and definitely my last! Our first experience was okay. Our waiter looked and had the personality of a zombie- rough living in Vegas? It seemed as though we had better luck tracking down anyone else but him to request water refills and anything else we needed. It took so long to get bread that we didn't think they gave bread at this restaurant, and we were perplexed at the idea that an Italian restaurant did not offer bread. I had the gnocchi, suggested by the owner with a side remark that I should order it because I would never make it at home? (Really?) the sauce was like one of the most flavorless marinara sauces I have ever had. It tasted like tomato paste. My husband got a seafood dish and loved it. Overall, it was overpriced. My husband wanted to go back for Valentine's Day and we got a Groupon. We have a very well behaved 15 month old child that goes with us when we dine out. We had just gotten seated when much to my dismay, we lucked out with zombie man again. He was more perky this time. We placed out orders and my son was sitting on my lap. He picked up one of the empty small salad plates on the table and as I was starting to put it down, the owner walked up behind me snatched the plate from my child's hand and proceeded to tell me how expensive the plate was. I was in shock! Who would treat guests in their restaurant this way? I don't care how much your plates cost! We got up to leave and he had the nerve to ask me if I had canceled my order with the waiter? How embarrassing for him. Side note* while this restaurant is \"nice\" they do have high chairs for children and toys for children claiming to be child friendly. I would not recommend going to this place, neither the food or service is worth it!",

I overheard her telling one of the waiters not to give anything extra only what's on the table. I assumed she was talking about us since we asked for extra bread and oil. She is very rude. The food is way overpriced and taste more like Olive Garden. Menu is boring. I see why only a few tables were filled on a Friday night. Save your money! Way better options in Henderson!",

    "text": "Gaetano's has been known as one of the best Italian places in Henderson for some time now but I'd have to disagree.    Decor Gaetano's decor is intimate and dark with some nice music lightly playing in the background. I loved the ambience and believe it is the perfect setting to grab a bottle of wine and bring a date or just catch up with some old friends. That I liked.  Service Our server was very informative and polite, however outside of that the service was subpar.  We had to constantly request basic things like a spoon for soup, a refill on drinks, or make an attempt to flag the server down to ask for bread and to place our meal orders. For a place at this price point I expected some type of attentive service and wasn't even greeted with mediocre service. Considering that the restaurant only had about 15 people in it, it's unclear as to why service was so poor.  It was also interesting to read how other Yelpers commented on the owner visiting the tables and introducing himself. Strangely, we watched as he went to every table but ours. Perhaps we weren't dressed appropriately, perhaps he didn't see us (despite there being only about 6 parties in the entire dining room) or perhaps he just didn't like us. Either way I would have to say that him snubbing us for whatever his reason was unprofessional and unfortunate.  Food We had the calamari, the stuffed salmon, mushroom soup and the cioppini. Honestly, there's nothing to rave about here, I can't even really say it was \"meh\", basic meals with nothing that exceptionally stood out. The mushroom had a variety of mushrooms blended with a bit of truffle oil in the middle. It was interesting and you could taste the variety of mushrooms in the soup, which was nice.  But outside of that I have had better calamari at Buon Gusto, better cioppini at the Oyster Bar at Southpoint and way better salmon at Off the Strip and Panevino. How is this the best Italian in Las Vegas? It's not even top 5. Maybe they were having an off day but I have no idea why people think this place is the best Italian place in the city.  Bottom Line: Is Gaetano's the best Italian in Las Vegas? No. They're not even the best restaurant on their block. I would much rather travel the extra 30 seconds to Buon Gusto on Eastern and Horizon Ridge Parkway or Montesano's a couple minutes  down by St. Rose and have a better experience and meal.",

The first time for mains I had pasta e fagioli followed with braciole with gnocchi. The pasta e fagioli was nice and hot, but lacked a lot of flavor. The gnocchi were mushy, and the flavor of the braciole was decent, however I had a stomachache the next day.  The second meal I had squash ravioli for mains and they were quite good.   Waiters were great at describing the specials but didn't necessarily have a comprehensive knowledge of the rest of the menu, which is a fairly standard pan-Italian menu. Both times the service was inattentive during the meal but quick to give the check.   In sum, based on my two dining experiences this is a trattoria trying to pass itself off as a ristorante. The service is not first-rate and neither is the food. I wouldn't be able to rate this place with 1 Michelin Star, i.e. 'very good cuisine in its category'. A further visit might push my rating up but for the time being, 2 stars.",

I like that they bring out foccassia bread as well as regular Italian bread.  The quality of the food is very very good, you can tell its homemade and not frozen/canned/premade, the portions are just super small which generally is the case with fine dining. I would return, but probably just on a date on with family. If I was going out with a friend I'd go to Brio for happy hour. Definitely worth trying, but don't expect Buca portions.",

I had a creamy pumpkin soup (with the spices just right), and fish cooked perfectly with a light, yet flavorful sauce. The wines were varied, and my very affordable Cabernet was rich and smooth.

I saw it on Groupon, so thought it was a good  opportunity to try it again.  First of all it is a beautiful room, and not very busy.  In fairness the food was 5 star, it was these odd occurrences that took it down to a three for me, and a 0 for the friend who went with me.  I ordered a roasted beet salad, when it arrived it was beautiful, but I grabbed the plate and it was filthy underneath.  I am always hesitant to send something back, but I just could not eat.  I know it is easy to have dirty plates in a restaurant, so I very gently explained to the server, I saw him take it to the manager.  A different server delivered a new one about half  of the size on a smaller plate.  Then the manager hurried by and said under his breath said \"enjoy your salad\".  Well I have seen enough exposes that that really creeped me out.  So although it was delicious I was uncomfortable eating it.  Although the restaurant was very quite, the manager never said a word to us.  No apology, no reduction in price, no acknowledgement that something had gone wrong.  My friend did not eat her dinner and I asked if she did not like it, she said the whole thing left her with such a bad feeling she could not dine comfortably, and would never go back, hence her 0 star rating.  I think I would have had a much better feeling about the whole experience if the manager would have at least come and apologized.",

I've had my eye on this place for awhile and it met every expectation, the staff was amazing and the food was even better. We all had something different and shared a bit of each others since everyone's food looked amazing! We also tried multiple appetizers which were also fantastic. It was late and we were the last patrons in the restaurant, no one attempted to rush us as we lingered and chatted and even opened gifts. Was a overall fabulous experience and will definitely be back again.",

My husband and I dined on a Saturday and chose to sit at the bar where Zachary rolled out excellent customer service.  First, the cocktails he mixes up are dangerously delicious. Second, I was craving risotto - but wasn't to thrilled about their risotto dishes on the menu.  Zachary said the restaurant would accommodate us and asked me what I normally like with my risotto.   A short while later - I had my risotto dish with shrimp and asparagus.  The dish was simply divine! Perfectly cooked risotto which is always so hard to find.  We also had the butternut squash ravioli, home made rigatoni with sausage and and the tiramisu with Gaetano's special hot chocolate. Mr. Gaetano himself was walking around greeting guests! My husband and I will definitely return.",

We had a reservation, and we were seated immediately, but we had been sitting awhile before our drink orders were taken. And then when they were, it took awhile for them to get to the table and for our waiter to come back to get our appetizer order.  We got our appetizers fairly quickly. However, there were 35+ minutes between the time we finished our apps and received our main course. During this time I think a busser came over to refill our water, but otherwise didn't see our waiter. I had ordered the gnocchi, which was okay but on the bland side, and my boyfriend ordered the lasagna, which came out cold.   My boyfriend had to work later that evening, and we thought we allowed ourselves plenty of time, but by the time the food came out, we were crunched for time, so we just quickly ate some of our food, boxed up the rest, and left. I wouldn't go back, especially paying full price.",

His suggestions were right on and the food was delicious.    My husband had the eggplant dish which I thought was amazing and I had the pesto pasta which was very good.  The kids enjoyed fettucini alfredo spilt 3 ways which they do charge $5 to do (although there is no kids meals).

Gaetano's is located in a small fairly innocuous strip mall and shares a parking lot with Chipotle and Wild Wings amongst others. Don't let the location fool you. The restaurant itself is a fairly large dining room with very high ceilings. Very classy. Off to the side there is a bar that is walled off from the restaurant. After we were seated, our server, Steve, was at the table almost immediately to answer any questions about the menu and to tell us about the specials for the evening. Our busboy, food runner, and server all gave near perfect service throughout the entire evening. We started the meal by sharing the portobello mushroom appetizer. Excellent choice! For my entree, I went with the salmon stuffed with crab. My wife had the chicken marsala. Each dish was outstanding.  While the price point is a little higher than several of the other local Italian restaurants , the fact that this is fine dining with outstanding food, service, and ambience makes the price worthwhile.",

And the rich history shows in how this restauranteur and his family treat you from the moment you walk in to your departure. When I think of fine dining off the strip in Las Vegas, few places come to mind but Gaetano's is one.  The atmosphere is fantastic. Spacious, comfortable seating and a great vibe, you are relaxed and eager to experience the menu at Gaetano's. The bar is a good place to start with a cocktail or glass of wine. Once at the table Gaetano does a great job of walking you through the specials of the night, of which there were plenty. Before looking at the menu you already have several dishes you absolutely want to taste.  The menu itself is full of Italian classics - chicken parm, Osso Bacco, veal Milanese, and a host of amazing sounding pasta dishes. I went with the Osso Bacco served with Safran risotto. It was perfect. We started with the buffalo mozzarella which paired well with the home baked bread basket. The special Mediterranean salad was also very good, freshly prepared and seasoned tossed style.   Gaetano's food is exceptional however where he really demonstrates his high caliber cuisine is in the range and quality of his desert menu. One after another the selection is classic Italiano but prepared to Gaetano's family signature style. We ordered several deserts to share and they were fabulous.   I'm glad we came to Gaetano's. It's going to be a regular spot for me when looking to dine out in Henderson.",

Especially for one of the other person's in our party's food. She pretty much could only eat the basic spaghetti with marinara sauce & was charged $17 for it.... ummm okay. On top of it our waiter was very short with us & hardly checked up on us. A little standoffish, perhaps because he thought since we're a younger crowd we wouldn't tip... fully unaware two out of the four of us are in the industry... My food was absolutely delicious but not enough to come back. I'm sure they give great service to the older crowd though. Great wine selection too.",

The dining room is open, clean, well appointed and beautiful.  The staff is first rate, always mindful but never overbearing.    We started with the ravioli tasting plate, which everyone should get on their first trip to Gaetano's.  It included four large hand made raviolis - beet (really!), veal, pesto chicken and tomato.  They were all incredible and I will probably order a full plate of one of them on our next trip, but picking one will be very hard!  I was impressed by the beet ravioli in particular because of how unique it was.     I had the veal with risotto.  The quality of these two items always comes down to the skill of the cook. Anyone who has made risotto knows how time intensive and difficult it is to get right.  This was the best risotto I've ever had.  The rice was just cooked/firm enough and the sauce/cream was the perfect consistency.  The veal was perfect too.  I had spumoni for desert and it was delicious.  We will be sending out of town visitors here when they ask for a good, classy place to eat.  Can't wait to go back!",

So we jumped at a Groupon offer and reserved for this past Saturday night - a couple we know well wanted to takes us for a birthday dinner. We gave them our Groupon to ease the cost a bit. My husband asked about using the Groupon - which apparently was a mistake because the attention we got vanished.  We received our soups and salads quickly as well as the bread baskets. All good. But then we started to wait. We asked for another bread basket - we were brought burnt bread. Awhile went by and asked for another - we were having good conversation and didn't really notice the time. Second basket even worse. It occurred to me - how long has it been? Turned out it had been 45 minutes since the salad. No wonder we were hungry! I mentioned it to my tablemates. They said they were sure the entree wiuld be served soon. Five minutes later, I noticed people who came in after us were eating. I went to the hostess and asked. She checked and said, \"It will be soon now. He forgot to put in the order and it had just been fired\". So we would have just sat there all night if I hadn't said something. It didn't occur to anyone that we were sitting there with NO FOOD and there might be something wrong. The hostess said they would give us free desserts. I didn't want their dessert, I like to go to Cream for ice cream. My group, though, said okay. The entrees were very tasty, my friend loved the mezzaluna and we liked our pasta. After the meal, my husband said we would just have two desserts and asked what they had on offer. No, the hostess told us, they would bring something out. One cheesecake, one tiramisu. Everybody in our group hates coffee flavor, only one liked the cheesecake. It was weird - if they were trying to make it up to us, shouldn't we have been asked what we wanted to have? For the record, we tip on the full amount of the meal, not the discounted price, since we are retired from the restaurant business. This was obviously not everyone's experience, but it was ours. The level of hostility from the crew was palpable as we left, like it was OUR fault. Maybe because they still had more burnt bread in the kitchen they wanted to get rid of.",

I had chicken piccata, sauce was lemony, with the right consistency, and the chicken was tender.  By consensus, the winner dish for the evening was the braciole special.  Food prices are decent, somewhere between strip mall and strip prices.  For me, what gets this place to a strong four stars is the bar.  If you are a Negroni fan, or mixology in general, save some time after dinner to hang out at the bar.  The general manager, Nick, runs the bar as well.  Negroni Sunrise (they infuse Campari with coffee) and barrel-aged Negroni cocktails go down great.  Someone else at the table had the Sorrento Stroll, which is a very refreshing Gin + Fernet Branca + Lemon/Thyme cocktail, which was great as well.",

Their theory is, if they have it in the kitchen, they can make it for you. So if you are craving something specific and don't see it listed on the menu, it's worth asking if they can make it. Gaetano's always uses the highest quality and freshest ingredients. I ordered a plate of sausage and peppers with pasta and the serving size was excellent, the food was absolute delicious, and the wine pairing that Nick suggested was perfect.  Service-5 stars Food-5 stars Overall experience-5 stars  I recommend Gaetano's highly!",

    "text": "We had an urge for italian and wanted to try a new place. Since my bookmarks just seem to keep growing, I decided to check there first. Not suprising, this place showed up.  From outside it looked like a typical strip mall restaurant but after walking through their doors, this place transitioned itself to a bold and elegantly decorated space. The dining tables were spread on a huge open layout, nice tall vaulted celing and dim lighting that set a nice tone.    What we got:  House Bread and dip: I loved the their plain slices of bread dipped in their olive oil red vinegar. But even better was their stick slices of what I call deep dish pizza with no cheese and just a little tomato sauce. We were off to a nice start!  Bruschetta: small thin toasted slices of bread with garlic, fresh chopped tomato and parmesan + herbs. Very nice but could of done without this, since their House/comp bread was great!  Ravioli di Pollo alla Genovese (homemade chicken ravioli with pesto sauce): chicken was pureed and stuffed in the delicate pasta surrounded by the typical pastel green color pesto sauce. It was Really Good! Only negative was that we felt that a little more chicken in each ravioli would of balance the pasta/filling ratio much better.  Ossobuco alla Milanese (braised veal shank, redwine, fresh herbs, tomato sauce served on a bed of saffron risotto): The Meat was Absolutely Delicious! Only negative is that it wasn't as tender as it could of been, maybe another hour or 2 of slow cookin' should done the trick?! Good size meat portion;although, I've had bigger. Bone marrow was tasty little treat but it was on the small side and filling seemed missing?! The risotto was perfectly cooked, paired with the shank and sauce, was incredible!!   * I also had a Sterling Cabernet with the Ossobuco and it was splendid :)  Tiramisu (homemade in house): Nicely presented and tasted fantastic. They use an Amaretto type liquor which definitly comes through and was quite unique from what I'm used to. And the texture was on a sharp point! Very nice choice to end a memorable dinner.  Beautiful Decor, Mellow Atmposhere, Great Food, Service Impressive and Value was Great for quality! Yeah, I like this place!",

I found out about this place from a friend and I was especially pleased to find them on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a>. So my husband and I printed our $50 gift certificate and headed out on a Friday night. I started the meal with the best cosmo I have ever had, it was definitely strong but I didn't taste any alcohol. The bartender is masterful! I then moved on to the bread basket on the table. The regular bread was delicious and warm. There was also an herb, almost pizza looking bread that I was not very fond of, but I am sure somebody enjoys it. I did notice that other tables were getting bruschetta as well as bread, but I got the feeling they were \"regulars,\" but it made me feel left out! We moved on to appetizers. I had the caprese salad, which has roasted peppers and onions on it. I was surprised how well the whole thing worked, given its non-traditional nature. I would definitely recommend it! For the main courses, I had the papardelle with filet and my husband had the trout special. The pasta was delightful and the filet was melt in your mouth delicious, but the dish was missing something. It was earthy and rustic but there was a flavor profile missing for sure. The trout was well cooked, but the skin of the fish was not at all crispy and we felt it should have been. It came with a side of pasta that was delicious! Since we had the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon we decided to go all out and get a dessert. We decided to go out on a limb and try the Sicilian cannoli. The cannoli was almost inedible. It has an overwhelming lemon flavor and is just very off-putting texturally.   The service was wonderful, until the end of the meal. The restaurant had filled up very fast and people were asking to be seated in our server's section. The poor man was running from table to table! It took us over 15 minutes to get someone to swipe our credit card so we could leave, but other than that small ordeal the service was impeccable. Overall, it was a mixed bag for us. I have had better Italian food in Las Vegas, but I may give this another try sometime in the future.",

    "text": "I came here with my girlfriend to celebrate Valentine's Day (the Saturday before) and made the reservations through Yelp/Open Table -which worked successfully, if anyone is curious. I took advantage of the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> offer, of course (including a coupon code, therefore getting a $25 certificate for $2 :D)  I heard about the place a long time ago and wanted to try, so finally took advantage of the gift certificate. The atmosphere is nice (dim, calm and romantic) when you walk in you can see they've won a few awards. I really like the way it is tucked into the corner of the strip mall/area and the way they utilized the space. I felt like it was a place you could find in a more urban area and like I kind of made a discovery. I could instantly tell this place was family owned, and the owner was very nice (and funny). He seated my girlfriend and I and rattled off all the specials. I liked the guy because he reminds me of some of the family members on my dad's side from \"the old country\", he made sure to cover the details of the specials and addressed any of our questions. Our waiter was a nice guy too, very personable, answered our questions, helped make suggestions etc.   Okay onto the food..  The traditional appetizer bread that you get with the meal is awesome. Fresh made, fluffy, warm and tasty. The sticks with marinara were so good and they even offered to bring us more (which we declined because we ordered quite a bit of food).  For the appetizer we had the melon and prosciutto. The prosciutto was a decent cut and was tasty, and the melon was fresh and crispy. Also it was a more generous portion than I expected- we were given 6 good slices of prosciutto and melon.  It was really good, the only thing I would've changed was the melon was really cold (which is understandable because they have to refrigerate the slices/melon I'm sure)- but it can make it hard on sensitive teeth, just a personal preference. Either way, I recommend it.  My girlfriend had the Fettucini Alfredo with shrimp. She raved about it (I am not a fan of heavy cream sauces- particularly Fettucini Alfredo- so I didn't try it) , but it looked very good. The pasta is home-made and had a very nice color to it, and the shrimp were a nice size. She has an Italian background and is familiar with homemade pasta and said it was some of the best she has ever had.   I had the New York Strip with peppercorn/balsamic reduction. It was VERY good, cooked well and very flavorful. Also, it was a nice cut and large (I cannot remember if he said it was 10 or 12 oz, sorry this was a week ago). The dollop of mashed potatoes along side were delicious, the best I have ever had. The vegetables were o.k. But that balsamic reduction definitely made the meal- the steak was fantastic. Again, it was a generous portion, and I took some home (which is a rare thing for me).  *Just a side note- the Osso Buco here seems to be the hot thing. The table next to us ordered it and it looks fantastic- I don't eat veal, but I'm actually hoping to return and try it*  After eating I had a cappuccino, which although I'm not familiar with, I thought was really good and well-made.  The price was very reasonable- considering the experience, portion sizes and quality of food (especially with the coupon/certificate we had).   The reason why I gave four stars (and not five) was although the service was friendly and good, it was slow. We were there a good hour and a half (maybe more). It took a long time for our appetizer and longer for our food. Also, my food was fairly cold when I got it (but my girlfriend's was hot). If they can fix that- solid 5. The place can get  really loud too- which personally I don't mind, it's something I actually enjoy in Italian restaurants (it feels authentic) but if you're looking for a quiet place were you can have a soft conversation I wouldn't recommend a Friday or Saturday night here, we had to talk a bit loud over the crowd.   In all, it's definitely a new favorite of ours, we're hoping to return soon when we can treat ourselves (maybe on a quieter night where hopefully the service will be quicker) and we would recommend it.",

    "text": "This place has been on my bookmark list for years ! We finally tried this place Saturday night as a double date with some of Yelp's finest - Lisa L. and Eric R. I will definitely be coming back again in the future - it's by far the best Italian I've had in Henderson.   I agree with everyone that says Gaetano's needs to print a Specials menu! The list of 15 specials was so complicated even our waiter couldn't keep it straight. I love that they have specials, but the confusion of listening to soo many and trying to remember them was annoying.   We started with beef carpaccio (YUM) and a pretty mediocre bottle of wine. Although I don't blame Gaetano's for the wine - that's my fault for picking the wrong one :)  I had a 1/2 order of the chicken ravioli and a caprese salad for my main. The chicken ravioli was really good - definitely seemed homemade. The caprese was pretty awful. The mozzarella was yummy, but the olive oil was bland, there was no balsalmic, and they called it \"Caprese con pepperoni\" (I guess I'm an idiot for thinking \"con pepperoni\" implies there is pepperoni in the dish?). They had a huge pile of slimy red peppers in the middle and lots of onions. It was a weird rendition of a Caprese - not one I'd ever order again.   My husband on the other hand got one of the best Italian dishes I've had in my life! I had major jealousy that he got to eat such fabulous food while I was picking at my weird Caprese! It was veal stuffed pasta in a cream sauce with proscuitto and peas. It comes with mushrooms but my freakshow of a husband had them leave those out. Seriously this pasta was incredible!!! Even without the mushrooms this pasta was SO GOOD. The veal was so tender and perfectly flavored. Next time I guess we'll just be getting 2 orders of this fabulousness!!  A wonderful evening with friends and great food. Service was so-so, but the veal stuffed pasta will have me coming back!! Thank goodness it isn't a special and seems to be on the menu full time.",

    "text": "Gaetano Palmeri is a bona fide professional.  Having dined at his place in Calabasas, CA years ago, he's not skipped a beat.  The menu will satisfy just about anyone seeking an Italian meal with a great range of starters, a variety of pastas, great seafood and meat selections.  We're fond of the warm cabbage salad, but tonight we opted for the special arugula with goat cheese and champagne vinaigrette split.  My wife devoured the barramudi with chopped tomato and I coasted along with a risotto with chicken and asparagus.  Perfect mid-week meal.  The dining room is so comfortable in a refined way.  Murals and mirrors on the walls with soft but adequate lighting goes beyond inviting.  A full bar can start or end the meal and I'm told the desserts are special.  Can't say enough good things about Gaetano's.  We're not missing a repeat visit any time soon.",

    "text": "*4.5 Stars   We decided on Gaetano's for our anniversary and we were not let down. The atmosphere is very cozy and warm and the fact that it is family owned adds to the charm. The hostess is a bit gruff but she seem frazzled because they were very busy.  We had dinner on a Saturday at 6:30 p.m. It was already packed!! I would recommend making reservations. We made them on OpenTable.   Appetizer- We had the half order of chicken ravioli in pesto cream sauce- I would have liked my pasta cooked slightly longer, it was a little undercooked.  The filling and the sauce for this ravioli were absolutely wonderful. I was practically licking the pesto sauce off of the plate.   Salads- I had the caesar and my husband had the house salad. The caesar was good, just enough dressing, crispy lettuce, fresh croutons. Just a standard salad. The house salad was amazing! Mixed greens with shaved carrots, pine nuts, parmigiano cheese and balsamic vinaigrette. The balance of these ingredients were perfect. I loved it!  Entrees- They have an extensive list of specials as well as an impressive menu consisting of pasta and main entrees. My husband choose to have the Salmon stuffed with Dungeness Crab and I had the New York Steak. The Salmon was seasoned and cooked very well and was delicious. It was served on a bed of orzo with mixed vegetables. I ordered the steak medium and that is how it came out. It was topped with a balsamic reduction. You could really taste the flavor of the meat, it wasn't heavily seasoned. I would have preferred a little more salt and pepper. The steak was served with mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables. I was impressed with the entrees because the meat in both of our dishes was cooked perfectly. They really had so many things on the menu that looked good!!   Dessert- We didn't order desert but we were speaking with our waiter, Nick (who is also the owner's son) and mentioned it was our anniversary. He brought us some yummy tiramisu. Mild not too bitter. I don't know if I would order this again, but that is just my desert preference.   I order wine by the glass, but they have an extensive wine list consisting of full and half-bottles as well as full bar. My husband order GlenFiddich on the rocks. Based on the price, I would have thought it was 15 year, but it was only 12. A little overpriced. The only other thing I didn't really care for was the bread, it didn't seem very fresh to me.  Overall we had a wonderful evening and I hope to return to Gaetano's soon!",

    "text": "One of the best Italian places in the Vegas Valley area (for me, it's right up there with Nora's and Casa di Amore). Most times I'm in here, Gaetano and/or his wife are walking around talking to diners, seating people, taking orders, or monitoring the kitchen activities. Most of the servers are their sons or other family members. The dining room is big; I almost never make a reservation, and even so I've been able to get right in with 1-3 other people on Friday & Saturday evenings without a wait. The food is always amazing, and unlike some other places where the \"specials\" are old food they're trying to get rid of, Gaetano's specials are things he's been able to get a hold of and offer in limited supply, or just something he felt like making on a whim that day. There are always around 10 specials daily, and the waiters are amazing in their ability to rattle off every one of them with every ingredient and preparation along with it. I've never been let down by their food or their service. It's definitely more expensive than the Olive Gardens of the world, but it's totally worth it, and I can usually get 2-3 meals out of any pasta dish I'd order there. They also offer deals on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> that you can use once a month and help you to savor their deliciosity without making your wallet too sad.  Some of the best things I've had here are their penne a la vodka (I'm a sucker for a good vodka sauce, and theirs is one of my favorites); a special that pops up every so often that's pappardelle pasta, filet mignon tips, and shiitake mushrooms in a marsala sauce; a caprese-type salad made with burrata instead of mozzarella cheese (frequently on the list of specials); and their eggplant parmesan. When they offer fish dishes, they're always very fresh (I haven't ordered one myself but my mom has gotten fish the couple of times she's come here with me, and of course I always snag at least one bite of everyone else's dish at the table... if you dine with me, prepare to share the love!). They have a good-sized wine list with both by-the-bottle and by-the-glass options. The bread you get in the beginning with olive oil & balsamic is so good I have to stop myself from eating too much & spoiling my dinner. I always leave here fat & happy.",

    "text": "Molto bueno!   I am always looking for a great Italian restaurant.  I have found some quality places in town, but they were not perfect.  I think that Gaetano's is the closest I have found to perfect in town.  I lived in Italy when I was younger; thus, I am an Italian food snob where I turn down my nose at those chain places.    DH and I went last night.  Groupon offered a great deal, but they also have deals on their website.  I have a glass of pinot grigio, the pear and pecan salad, and gnoochi con gorgonzola.  The rate of how good an Italian restaurant is whether they have gnoochi and how good it is.  While, admittedly, my gorgonzola sauce is better, it's the best I have had in Las Vegas.  Also, the gnoochi was perfect little dumplings from heaven.  DH had the portabello mushrooms app and ravioli entree.  He enjoyed both, but said he would try a different pasta next time.  I had a tiny bit of his mushrooms and found them to be yummy.  I have to say that I completely ignored his main dish because I was too focused on my gnoochi.  While I didn't finish my gnoochi (dinner tonight!), I had a cup of cappuccino before leaving.  The taste was perfect!    Fantastic memories of Italy were brought to mind when dinning at this fine establishment.  We will definiately be returning!  Staff was friendly.  Kept DH's drink full, offered more bread, and generally checked on us regularly.  One note for groupon users: they automatically added 18% tip on bill, which was fine with me, but FYI.",

We looked at the menu & had our meals picked, but when Alex returned he gave us the rundown of the daily specials, it changed everything!

We came in around 7 and the place wasn't too packed. We were greeted warmly by the hostess and seated quickly. Almost immediately our drink orders were taken and a minute after that our server greeted us and welcomed us to the restaurant. He came back a few minutes later to give us a rundown on all the specials for the evening. The list was definitely extensive. Probably would benefit them to write them down since the waiter was forced to list about 15 different specials which a bit time consuming, but still informative.   I was debating between the pappardelle and the gnocchi, but I ended up going with the gnocchi. My fella ordered the chicken ravioli and my mom got the lasagna. The bread was really good and they were very generous with the quantities. We started with the artichoke heart appetizers, which was great. Our food took quite a bit of time to come out. We were left waiting for a really long time, but our server was extremely apologetic for the delay however. The food finally came out and everyone was extremely pleased with their meals.   Delicious, I'll definitely be back again since I know they offer restaurant. com deals.",

Once we were at our table and our food was served I realized we were better off going to the place next door !! Food was so plain and flavorless !  I've been to San Francisco ca, Monterey ca and Los Angeles and this place doesn't even come close to it!! Really sad I was thinking about the ciopinno for the past week and I was so disappointed!

Started with   which was good, not great the bread was to chrunchy as when bitten into the bread fell apart~        All our entrees were very good, salmon pieces in pasta with a vodka sauce, 2 orders of  spaghetti & meatballs and rigatoni w/ meat sauce. The first 3 were specials~ the dessert menu is meza meza~predicable Italian options of which none were ordered.     Our server was attentive & DEFINATLY knew the menu!      A very nice dinner out at good prices. Would go back again & again",

It continued throughout the night All 5 of us were very happy with our meals .We found that we got True Italian food with fresh pasta and good quality sauces and proteins. They were very original and there were many options off the daily special menu. The Chiopinni was phenomenal  and enough for two people. The butternut squash ravioli was fantastic, very rich tasting and unique flavors to it. We ate so much that we didn't have enough room to enjoy the desserts which I'm sure would have been phenomenal as well. At the end of it all we got the bill and were pleasantly surprised with the price. Definitely a recommendation and we plan on coming here again and again when we are in Las Vegas.",

The ravioli sampler appetizer was great.  The veal scallopini was terrific.  But those who ordered the pappardelle with sirloin tips special hit the jackpot.  Their take on cioppino included half a lobster!  Everyone was happy with the food.  Very nice decor, not immediately apparent from the strip mall exterior.  Nice wine list.  Expensive.   But a truly exceptional meal.",

    "text": "I was actually a little flabbergasted when I stepped into this restaurant. Who knew such an Italian gem of a restaurant was nesseled in this unassuming strip mall in Henderson?  At first I thought I was a little underdressed for this restaurant. They have white table cloths and the whole setup of wine/water glasses, silverware etc. I felt like I needed to dress up a little bit before I stepped in there. Turns out, I was fine with whatever I was wearing (casual button up with jeans). That's great because I was hungry!  They started off our dinner with a bread basket with 3 different kinds of bread. They also had a balsamic/olive oil dipping plate for our warm toasty bread, that came hot out of the oven.  I took some recommendations from the waiter, Danny. He is definitely a great waiter and just a stand up guy to talk to. He will chat and explain the menu in detail and answer any questions for you. I took a once over of the menu and realized that fried calamari was on their appetizer and had to try it. I was also torn between the Butternut squash ravioli and the homemade Lasagna (both homemade made from scratch in house). I took Danny's recommendation and tried the Lasagna, and I was not dissappointed.   The Lasagna was so flavorful. Each layer was perfectly cooked and almost melted in your mouth when you took a bite. The cheese that was melted on top was just right and not overcooked. Their sauce was aboslutely delicious and the portion size was just right.   The calamari was definitely the best I have ever had in Vegas. The batter was not too overwhelming and the crunch was slight and the calamari had great texture. A+ for their lemon half being a mesh package so that the seeds don't fall out over the calamari when squeezing the juice out of it. The little things that make it special.  After dinner, I sat here in amazement by the absolute attention to detail this place has given their food. The dedication to their food is noticeable in their presentation and their taste of each dish presented. Their service was always on par with plates being cleared and water being refilled. I would highly recommend anyone in the area to try this restaurant. If you have seen it before and just passed it by, please don't and try it for yourselves. I don't think you will be disappointed.  Take a date, bring a friend, bring family. You will love it.",

Uh Yeah....Get there and of course I had to make a snarky comment that in fact we did show up. While the food was good didnt think it was the best Italian as others have said. When the waiter asked if I wanted parmesan cheese he didnt ask my friend so I asked if he would like some. The waiter then preceded to tell me that they dont put parm on that dish (clams and pasta) but he would and hope Gaetano wasnt looking. As a foodie I know that big name chefs dont put parm on fish but I didnt think we were at Spago or Mario Batalis. This is not an upscale place but I think it wants to be. It tries hard to be something its not.",

The fettuccine had no flavor, it was greasy and the noodles were glued together. Had to season it with red peppers, salt and pepper. I was ready to ask for ketchup to give it flavor.

Beating down the doors. Clearly this isn't a \"favorite\"'spot to begin with but being in the service industry (I work at Caesars and my bf works at Mandalay) we would've expected better.

The bad-this place is on Groupon and living social and when we mentioned it to them the waiter gave us the impression that we wouldn't tip appropriately.  We always tip very well and it left us with a bad taste.  Also, the lady that took our payment wasn't very friendly and I believe it was due to our living social deal.  It's too bad cause we would of gave it five stars.",

    "text": "Rare cause it's a family owned, well-known, successful italian restaurant, I absolutely love & to me.. it's better than Giada's.  Hate to say it Giada lovers.    First, I see what the chef's special are.  PAPPARDELLE FILLETTE please put this on your menu Gaetano sir, please.  Or as a weekly chef's special.  My only complaint is that this is not on the menu.  Melt in your mouth.  You will happily gain 5lbs or trade in your dessert for it... or get both. . Melt in your mouth, homemade pappardelle w/ mushrooms & a shredded filet throughout.  The first bite shocked me.  I can name many other dishes that are mind blowing since this is a chef's special. The Insalata di Cesare & Penne alla Vodka w/ chicken, other than that I always go w/ the Chef's Special.  It's exciting & keeps me from always ordering the same thing.    Certain Italian restaurant's have their most perfect dishes such as I love a certain veal parmesan, chicken parm, parm chicken, different things, different places.  A few items I do like at Giada's, so I know it's a strong statement.  Gaetano's has a consisitency & family type recipe you can taste in the sauce.      Buon appetito!",

We were seated right away without any reservations which was great.  We were greeted very quickly and were given bread right away.  Their bread is baked fresh daily and you can definitely tell.  Our waiter told us the daily specials and they sounded delicious.    I had the fillet of Sole with a side of butternut squash ravioli ( my weakness) and my family had bolognese pasta, a spicy pasta, and veal parmesan.  Everything looked beautiful when it came out and their portions are very big and sharing sizes.  The fish was very fresh (which is rare lol no ocean)   Unfortunately I had room for dessert although they sounded so good!  I can't wait to come back to this restaurant and try new items off the menu.  One of the better italian places in Vegas off the strip!",

Which was confusing since the Restaurant closes at 10:30. We didn't end up going because we already felt unwelcome thanks to Rory. We both work in the service industry and as long as Rory is taking the rsvp's business is going down. Pretty disappointing seeing how we are locals that live in the area and love our local near-by spots. On a good note we went to Sea Salt instead. AHHH..MAZING please see my review for them.",

We were in Italy this summer and the food in several places was not even close to being as good as Gaetano's routinely serves, we laughed about needing to return to Henderson to get better Italian  food!   The service is always very attentive and very personal. We usually order one of their specials but the ones that are our favorites are  The veal chop, the branzino, Chilean sea bass, Cioppino, and the Osso buco.  Everything is wonderful. You are in a family owned and run restaurant. They take great pride in their food and their hospitality. You will be well cared for and you will not be disappointed.... I promise",

Called the owner Rory not very pleasant she said she would take half off the charge for my pasta which is $40 so she'll just charge me $20 cause she said I ate everything. She must be psychic to know what im doing or eating of course i didnt eat the whole pasta cause it has rocks. I ate some yesterday at the restaurant but took 3/4 home cause I was full from the $300 meal we ate. I felt a little sand yesterday but thinking its just from the clam. Tried to enjoy it again today but its worst cause now theres more sand and rocks in the bottom of the pasta. Wish the owner was more sympathetic considering i was only complaining of one item from the 9 items we ordered. If i wasnt 30 minutes away from this restaurant i would show this to the owner. Too bad cause my expectations was high for this restaurant. Owner needs to listen to her customers concerns than just slapping them with half off for their ordered food. Never coming back!",

    "text": "I'm always searching for quality Italian restaurants in the Las Vegas area and I'd rank this among my favorites so far.  My husband and I were doing the last minute where to eat game on a Saturday night. I knew I \"needed\" Italian food and this restaurant was my suggestion. I wish I remember how I found out about this restaurant in the first place, but I have no idea where my suggestion came from. Regardless, it was a great idea. I got nervous when we pulled into the parking lot and saw the number of people entering the restaurant. It was a last minute decision so we didn't have a reservation. No problem! The hostess sat us right away and didn't act annoyed that we had arrived without a reservation.  The inside of the restaurant is much larger than it appears from the outside. It's decorated the same as most other traditional Italian restaurants are decorated. The room is nice and open with tables nicely spaced. The restaurant also has a fairly large bar area separated by a wall.   We started with the free Bruschetta with the Yelp check in offer. I enjoyed the toasted bread with the fresh bruschetta ingredients. It wasn't overloaded with garlic. The bread basket was nice with some herbed bread, plain ciabatta, and lavash. The herbed bread was my favorite bread. Bread is served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. That part I didn't love because the balsamic wasn't quality and was overpowering the oil. Oil with seasoning would have been much better. In fairness, I'm a balsamic snob so this probably isn't something that other people would even care about or notice.  The menu offered so many great entree options. It was hard to choose. My husband and I finally narrowed to two items and switched plates at the half-way point. The Lasagna Bolognese had a nicely flavored Bolognese with plenty of meat and cheese. This was both tasty and hearty. The Chicken Parmesan was nicely breaded and I liked the flavor of their marina sauce.   Even though we'd probably eaten too much at this point I just couldn't resist dessert. The Pistachio Tartufo was excellent. The pistachio ice cream was creamy and had the pistachio punch I was craving. The chocolate chips and cherry were nice with the pistachio flavor.   Our server was nice and delivered each course with good timing. We maintained full water glasses and were checked in on often. We'll definitely return!",

The coupon is $25 off $50 in food purchase. Great, easily done, my dish alone cost $50. We spent over $100 in food. We got a bottle which normally was $40 and was on sale for $22. Now, none of this would have been an issue if someone had told us that we couldn't get it for that sale price with the coupon, period. No putting it off on it's own check, no nothing, even with over $100 worth of food.  So when I got the check with a $40 dollar bottle of wine that retails for $10 at Total Wine. I was not overly happy. Sever said there was nothing to do. I just wish someone had warned me about this prior since I would have stuck with cocktails (which sounded like drinks to write home about) and not the wine.  Here is the good now: Nick has the bombastic mustache. Our server Jacob was fantastic as well, some of the best and most prompt service I have gotten in Vegas in a long while. All that was missing was a crumber. Haha. The food was divine, we got the bordetto mussel app, the broth was flavorful and even good to dip bread in. I got the veal osso buco with risotto. This was done to perfection, the risotto was cooked fantastically and the marrow of the bone was delish. My boyfriend got the ciopinno special and he loved it as well. Hats off to the chef!  Will I be back? I dunno. For the food and service, sure but not with a coupon apparently.",

    "text": "The Chronicles of Groupons at Gaetano's, Episode Two: Attack of the Minimum Spending.  I returned to Gaetano's Ristorante with just days remaining to spend the promotional balance of my Groupon. The maitre d' greeted me and, in response to my request for a table for one, suggested that I go to the bar where I could enjoy some television. I shrugged and said sure, why not.  So I was seated in one corner of the bar with a bad angle for one television and hardly any lighting whatsoever for photos. Whoop-de-doo.  Anyway, the bartender/server got me some water and presented me with the dinner menu as well as a printout of Friday's specials. Tempting as the cioppino and the venison were, I stayed the course and went for the Ossobucco alla Milanese ($38.95), a braised veal shank with red wine demi-glace, fresh herbs, and tomato sauce, served with saffron risotto.  Complimentary bread was great again, although I puzzlingly enjoyed the tomato focaccia more than the ciabatta this time. Also, the olive oil seemed a bit less-than-generous.  The ossobucco arrived after I'd devoured the bread, and I resolved to ask for a brightly lit table next time. You eat with your eyes first, after all. Regardless, the food was great. The veal shank is a carnivore's delight, with delicious soft tendons connecting a bone to huge chunks of meal that decidedly do not taste like chicken (or other meats, for that matter). Dig inside the bone with the three-tined fork (or the knife) and you'll get bone marrow that I'm going to call meat butter. Get the veal, tendons, and meat butter evenly in your bites and enjoy. I will say that the saffron risotto was less creamy and a bit more al dente than I'd hoped, but it's a traditional complement to ossobucco and generally got along with the meats just fine.  When I presented my Groupon and asked for the check, I was informed that there is a $40 minimum subtotal required to redeem the Groupon. I was a bit dismayed, but I quickly ordered the tiramisu ($8.50) as it had drawn my eye earlier. The ample portion of tiramisu arrived soon afterward, and my first bite was met with joy that it wasn't anywhere near the disappointment that was the last tiramisu I'd tried. It's soft and sweet-but-not-too-sweet, and frankly everything you'd want out of a tiramisu save for the lack of alcohol. The cocoa powder stood out, perhaps because it was dusted over the plate and I was able to apply it liberally to every bite.  I'll probably try to get away from the risotto next time I eat at Gaetano's. Although my rating hasn't changed, I still felt the need to share my dining experience posthaste with those in search of Italian restaurants or carnivorous treats. Groupon or not, it's worth a try.",

The first time I went was spring Restaurant Week. I have to say that I wasn't overtly impressed with the meal for the price, but I did enjoy it enough to buy the Groupon and try it again. Last night I had the fig appetizer--goat cheese, balsamic, wrapped in proscuitto ($14 for 3, noooot worth it but still good) and the butternut squash ravioli. That dish is absolutely superb. The portion size is perfect. My mom had a marsala special which was also absolutely incredible....we cleaned our plates and then some. Dessert was the tiramisu, which I didn't really have room for and didn't need, but I still enjoyed the dessert like I do.   I would definitely come here again or recommend it to someone who wanted good, high-quality Italian food and didn't want to venture to the Strip for similar quality at twice the price.",

She \"ripped\" the bartender..., in front of several clients..., for leaving a small dish of cheese on a client's table until their pizza arrived.  She later came back and \"ripped\" him again for the same think only this time it was because he put the dish of cheese in the cooler.  Both of these exchanges were heard by the clients in disbelief..!!  I will not go back there as long as she is around..!!",

    "text": "I have been in search of 3 things in this town.   1. Good Service  2. Better tasting food then my friends or I can cook at home.  3. And a final bill that is in line with the entire experience.  After eating at Gaetano's on Monday I can say I'm getting very close.   Service Once we arrived we were greeted and sat at a great table in a very nice dinning room area. Our servers name was Zach. He was very knowledgable about all the food and timed his stops at our table perfectly.   The Food We originally selected Gaetano's because of an email that advertised veal. However, once we asked about it we were told they ran out of it days before. (This along with the fact that they didn't honor our Yelp checkin special coupon because we already had an open table discount, was the only reason they didn't receive 5 stars). After learning they were out of the veal we selected the Sea Bass and the Calamari. Once they arrived we couldn't stopped eating them. The taste of both dishes was hands down better then I could ever cook myself! So I can't wait to go back!  The Bill We got bread, an app, 2 main dishes, desert, a bottle of wine, and a cappuccino for just over $100! The food was amazing. The service was fantastic. And the whole experience was right in line with the bill. Oh and just so everyone knows we were not forced to pay a gratuity.   We will be back!",

This little gem is located off Eastern between 5 Guys and Buffalo Wild Wings.   Nick has been our server both times and he's very knowledgable about the food, wine, and culture of Italy - because he's been there.   Look, the food is amazing, the wine list complete and affordable, and it's family owned which satisfies this girl's need to support the independent business.   Get to Gaetano's!!

The service was IMPECCABLE and the food was delicious. The salad was perfectly dressed, the bred was fresh (even at 9pm) and the wine was perfectly chilled. My husband had the chicken piccata and it was awesome. I had the pork rolls with homemade gnocchi and although the pork itself was a touch dry (that's what you get when you order the braised pork special late in the evening) I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. The owner chatted with us before our departure and we told him we would definitely be back! It is special occasion only prices for us, but I'll keep this place in mind for sure!",

We split the \"special\" ravioli... oh and by the way, when the owner rattled off the extensive list of specials, he never mentioned prices... it was stuffed with very little sausage and very little rapini in an overwhelming cream sauce and my half was left under a heat lamp for an extra 10+ minutes...$24.95 - $8 more than the other ravioli from the regular menu  My wife had a glass of house white... a decent pour, but when she order another, instead of a fresh glass, they brought a mini carafe and poured it into the 1st glass... poor form and shorter pour.  No dessert, no coffee  I wonder if when they brought the bill they put a 7up on there because I wasn't drinking?  Maybe just a mistake.  I do feel that the $80+ was outrageous for what we got",

    "text": "The absolute worst service I have had in 50 years of dining! It started with sitting and waiting on my waiter Nick. He arrived after sitting a good 10 minutes to order Panna bottled water (meanwhile no tap water, no bread, no nothing - just napkins, flatware and a fake candle). He did not ask if we wanted wine, nothing.. and handed us a menu. I then had to flag him down (flag down 1) to request bread, dipping oil and wine. Her returned and we ordered an appetizer, each ordered a salad and entree... but still waiting on the bread and oil, which did show but showed by someone else but no wine yet..... (flag down 2) second request for wine and another bottle of water and Nick motioned to me but nothing ever arrived - hence I had the bartender that was walking by my table grab the second bottle of Panna water - STILL no wine. Our salads arrived after a long wait from again, someone other than our waiter.... still no wine. (Flag down 3) asked Nick for my wine a third time, and the second bottle of Panna was almost empty... Nick returned with our entrees and the original glass of wine I ordered... however we NEVER received our appetizer! we had ordered the Bruchetta and it never came out of the kitchen! With our meal almost finished, (Flag down 4) and very frustrated, I yelled out to Nick about the missing appetizer and he said he would pour a glass of wine for me on the house (which I had already been waiting on the second glass for quite some time) and rushed off to get the wine.. He came back at his own speed and poured glass number 2 and apologized about the appetizer. I requested a 3rd bottle of Panna... It fell on deaf ears...My kids wanted a dessert and I told them NO WAY! It is Mothers Day and I did not want to wait till Football Season to get the desert ORDERED (FIGURING IT WOULD BE THE NEW YEAR BEFORE THEY ARRIVED)... During this process Nick hit my daughter in the head with his serving tray (no suprise nothing was on it) and simply stared at her, no apology. WORST GASTRONOMY EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!",

    "text": "I have been going to this place for many years now and I cannot tell you how upset and surprised we were with the treatment we received last night. My family and I live in Las Vegas so taking the time to drive to this place should tell you how much we used to enjoy going there, however last night when greeted by the owner at the entrance, we will never go back and will absolutely spread the word on how this man operates.  As we entered at 6pm we noticed only two patrons in the place they were at the bar.  The owner greeted us and promptly proceeded to offend  us from there on out.  We had our 6 month old sleeping baby with us in his car seat and the owner when going to seat us walked us through the bar area which is rather narrow and put us directly in the back of the restaurant to the side of the doors of which there was one lone table. Now mind you the restaurant was totally empty,  except for the two people at the bar. We asked why were were being seated away from the main dining room, and in the back by the bathroom doors and he said because we had the baby.  He said I don't want crying kids and noisy things making noise and neither does anyone else.  I cannot tell you how rude this was not too mention discriminatory .  I have been to 5 star restaurants every where and have never been treated so rudely. Not only was the baby sleeping but the restaurant was empty! We teach our children how to behave in restaurants from an early age, we always respect the feelings and wishes of other dinner patrons by walking outside with a crying child. How dare this man assume we are some sort of second class folk because we brought our baby with us.  We were humiliated and treated very poorly.  It was like a scene right out of 50s, you know like the times where people of color were segregated from whites because it was offensive to mingle the two together.     Needless to say we did not stay we just said no thanks and left he was all to happy to say bye.    Shame shame on this man for setting us back 70 years and not treating everyone as equals. We will never go back there no matter how the food tastes and I would hope that others do the same.   He himself is an immigrant and or an offspring of immigrant parents and should be mindful of everyone who lives here in this great country of the United States of America and stop discriminating against anyone of any type.   Bad for business Mr Gaetano I hope karma comes a knocking at your door with an iron fist!",

I was very impressed with the food on my first visit, all except for the Caesar Salad (did not care for the dressing) on the first visit.  But the food was amazing.  Our service was perfect....and everyone had very positive comments on the food.  For me...this is one of the best and most authentic Italian Restaurants in Las Vegas, and if you know the family history, they used to be in Calabasas before coming to Las Vegas in I believe 2002.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.   When I read the review from a Colleen F stating that she thought Carrabba's was cheaper with more flavor....I had to laugh and think to myself...poor girl has no idea what beautiful Italian food is all about.   It was like comparing a Pinto to a Mercedes.  I cannot wait to go back there again!",

We have been here before (maybe about a year ago) and weren't too impressed so we never came back.  Any how, below was our order:  -Appetizer: Brodetto $14.95 Clams and mussels, sauteed with garlic and served in a white wine and spicy tomato broth with garlic toast  I have to admit although it was pretty skimpy on the clams and the mussels, the broth was delicious.  It had a tad spicyness to it and was creamy with a hint of basil.  Almost reminded me of a hearty tomato soup.  -Entree #1: Rolatine di Melanzane alla Siciliana $16.95 Grilled eggplant stuffed with angel hair pasta in a fresh tomato sauce, topped with mozzarella cheese and bake  This was also good.  You get 3 pasta stuffed eggplants covered in fresh tomato sauce.  Again, the tomato sauce was yummy.  Had a tad sweetness to it kinda like spaghetti-o's...lol!  The eggplant was lightly battered (maybe pan fried, rolled then baked).  -Entree #2: Gnocchetti Sardi $19.95 Gnocchetti Pasta with olive oil, garlic, sausage and broccoli rabbi  We were disappointed with this dish.  The broccoli rabbi was over cooked resulting in a very bitter taste.  This broccoli is suppose to be slightly bitter; however having it overcooked resulted in an increase in the bitterness.  The pasta was slightly overcooked as it seemed quite chewy and The sausage was average. Nothing special.",

We ordered the special Bresola and the Veal Ossobucco, as well as a cold appetizer platter with various italian meats and pickled vegetables.  The food was good and definitely classic Italian.

This is a gem of a place, located in a strip mall. You can dress up or down. We've been there when they've hosted wedding receptions, and it's just a lovely, warm inviting atmosphere.   We stumbled upon this place one evening, and we went back for our weekly date night for the next three weeks. The food is fabulous, the staff friendly, and the service???? Frankly, whoever is the manager of this place, note to you: Please, please, please start a \"Master Class\" at some local college to instruct other restaurants on how to properly take care of customers. You'd be so rich, it'd be crazy. Other nicer restaurants WANT to be what this place is.   They have staff who just serve water. Staff who just bring out meals, staff to send out bread, staff to refill drinks, of course a sommelier, a manager who goes to each table to inquire about the meal, and to offer suggestions and support. And the main wait staff??? They are crazy informed about each daily special, and they know that menu by heart. So, if you feel like something light? They can offer suggestions. Want something hearty? They have that too.   I love their ravioli with tomato sauce, very light. I love their homemade pasta with shaved tenderloin in a mushroom sauce. Divine. The half chicken is so moist and delicious, my 13 year old devoured the dish with abandon. Even the attention to detail regarding mashed potatoes is visually appealing. Go once, relax with a nice wine, and enjoy. You'll love it.  Or don't go, that's fine. That way, we can still get in without a reservation. :-)",

Had Dinner last night... it was pretty empty ... 3 other tables were sat when we got there... of course, one table did have 10 people at it.  Ambience:  Quiet (unless there's a party of 10 whooping it up next to you)... can be Romantic / Intimate with the low lighting...white table cloths and stealthy servers Not Fancy... but Not Casual...   We had brought our own bottle of Prosecco to enjoy at the beginning of the meal and to toast my Mom's b-day.  I think the corkage fee was $15.  They immediately brought out Chilled Flutes and a bucket filled with ice to keep our wine cold....and they continued to refill our glasses til the wine was gone.  :)    We ordered the Bruschetta to start.... Pretty good... because the tomatoes were juicy... the bread got soggy.  Not the best Bruschetta I've ever had but it was good... give it 3 stars.  My mom and I split the Arugula salad (with goat cheese, pear slivers and candied pecans and a light champagne vinigarette).   5 stars Perfect portion to split as we wanted a salad but didn't want a BIG salad to start.  Very tasty... fresh arugula and the the goat cheese was melt in your mouth perfect.  I ordered the Special Stuffed Veal Chop... WOW!  WOW!  WOW!   5 stars! It was D-LISH!  And the veal chop was HUGE.  I didn't finish it... took half home.  It was served with parmesan risotto of which... I took 1/2 of that home too. The chop was stuffed with parm, broccoli rabe, italian sausage and served in their Marsala sauce... SO GOOD!  Mom ordered the Crab Stuffed Salmon which was served on a bed of rice pilaf, sliced carrots and zucchini. I got a taste of hers and it was Very Good... but I liked my stuffed Veal Chop better. I'd give hers 4.5 stars because I liked mine better.  The husband ordered the Special Pappardelle pasta with Filet Mignon and Shittake mushrooms in a Creamy Marsala sauce.  I got a taste of this too... WOW!  Definitely 5 stars! It was rich and so much flavor. The shittake really added another dimension to the dish... of flavor and depth. I really liked his but was enjoying my veal so much that I didn't switch with him... although... I thought about it. Sadly, he ate ALL of his dinner so I don't get his leftovers.  Because it was Mom's b-day... they brought out Tiramisu.   YUMMMMM! 5 stars Light... Creamy.... Rich.  Not overly soaked in coffee ... and Not overly sugar-y.... One of the best Tiramisu's I've had.  My favorite is still the one at Celini's in New York but this one makes top 5.  Will I go back?  YES!",

It was seasoned well and very crispy.   I ordered the Vitellina alla Parmigiana and it's probably one of the best things I've ever eaten.   Boyfriend ordered the duck breast and thought it was okay. He wasn't crazy about the sauce (red wine demi-glace) and he thought the duck was just slightly overcooked. He started eating off of my plate though and LOVED the veal.  Overall, I'd give this place 4.5 stars. I will definitely be back!",

Missed the traditional gremolata (garlic/parsley/lemon zest sprinkled over the shanks) but other than that it was perfect.  It was served over pasta, but again being the traditionalist when it comes to Ossobuco I asked for and got Risotto Milanese and it too was perfect.   Two others in my group ordered the same and they loved it. I love that the owner always makes it a point to talk to the patrons and maybe josh with them a little.  He always makes himself visible and available and if you need anything, or make substituions he's there and ready to accomodate. Nice touch.",

Then he asked us if we still wanted it ( after we reminded him) after our entrees came out. It was almost as if it was like-- \"oh yea oops my bad here ya go if you want\".

After reading the reviews of this place further (after our meal) expect to be seated towards the back by the bathrooms if you have a kid. The food was ok, i had the arugula salad and lasagna. I now wonder why my lasagna  was so tiny.  I felt like I was eating a creme brulee because they put it literally in one of those baking dishes for a creme brulee. I want to say only 2 layers and watery.  That's probably because I told them I had a groupon before we ordered. Darn! Keep it quiet until you pay!!! Service was good for the most part, probably because there were like 5 tables there! I could tell our server had a cold. His nose was dripping while he explained the specials! Germs! Yuck!!!  The best part of it at the end, the owner lady came rushing towards our table like a mad woman and basically tossed our check on the table. Like she was pissed that we had a groupon. Wow!

The fettuccine was one the best I've ever had!! The fettuccine pasta was delicate, delicious and an absolute delight! The carbonara on the other hand was super salty bc they use cured prosciutto and probably added too much salt? Otherwise it did have some good flavor and could've been really tasty if it wasn't so salty. The pear salad was a smaller portion than I would've liked. It was $14 for a small bed of arugula with feta and random prices of pear all diced into different shapes and sizes. I could eat that salad in 3 bites. The presentation was a fail (picture below) and the taste was just standard. Everything cost a bit more that it should. But the fettuccine pasta was delicious so I gave it 4 stars.",

Anyway, we were seated promptly and received excellent service from our waiter.   As an appetizer I ordered the fried zucchini flowers which are filled with goat cheese. This had good flavor but to me it seemed like it was frozen. When I bit into it some parts of the cheese were colder than others...which can only happen if the product was frozen prior. The flavor per se was ok but not a dish I would order again. A bit disappointing since I love goat cheese.   The second thing I ordered was the salmon stuffed with crab. This is an off the menu item but it is a special that our very attentive waiter recommended. This dish was served and I wish I was told it was going to be hot...because I burned my tongue. Anyway, the dish was also very flavorful but the salmon seemed a bit dry. I think this dish is missing some sort of sauce reduction to go on the top of the salmon.   The third dish ordered by my hubby was the risotto with shrimp. He devoured his plate and loved the flavors. I had a taste of his and it seemed like a delicious plate.   Overall I loved the service received here. The place is pricy so just be aware you will spend over $90 on two people if your order an appetizer. We did not get drinks. FYI: this restaurant has plenty of offers you can look for. On the website <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> they had a $25 dollars off coupon over $50. Purchasing this coupon is $10 so you end up with a $15 savings. I have also heard they have Groupons available.",

Water glasses stayed empty for log periods of time. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food, and a good time was had by all, but the hard to find service is the reason I gave this place 3 stars, instead of 4 stars.

The deco is of your typical Tuscan feel and the lighting was good not over dark. The service was very good our waiter knew the menu and specials well and described them accurately. I also appreciate the concern over my wife's gluten allergy and him double checking with the kitchen to ensure items did not have gluten in it. The wine selection was good lots of quality Italian wines but the mark up I felt was on the higher side of average. The food was good I had the duck breast with butternut squash raviolis. The food was well presented and prepared perfectly. I loved the light sauce with the ravioli it paired so well with the contents and complemented the heavy duck. Save room for dessert the tiramisu was so light and creamy you far one of the best I have had in Las Vegas.",

Plus we had almost the entire dining room to ourselves, so the service was impeccable.   The calamari was fantastic and came with a side of marinara. Amy would only eat the rings, but I ate the full small calamari and thought it was great. She said the little ones with all the tentacles freak her out. It was lightly breaded with what seemed like partially cornmeal and crispy fresh. I debated that the small ones were more tender. We then divided the plate so she had all the rings and I have the tiny tentacles, and we were good.   The fried zucchini blossoms stuffed with goat cheese was my favorite. Amy doesn't like goat cheese, so I ate them all quickly and efficiently while she munched on mussels. We both enjoyed the artichoke hearts, and the lemon sauce was light and complimented the dish nicely.  Next came the special, a buffalo mozzarella with fresh arugula and tomato. This was also very good with a sweet balsamic, but there wasn't much of it, so it went fast amidst our conversation about \"what if they made cheese from milking buffaloes\". Our server wasn't terribly impressed, but she was sweet and gracious. And more wine ensued...   Amy is a fan of Merlot, and picked up a bottle. I like Riesling. I like a sweet German Riesling to be exact. They had my second favorite on tap, Chateau St. Michelle. It's crisp and sweet and was pleasant with our selections. It was a fun night with great food and fun conversation. I will absolutely be back.",

I was also nervous because other reviews said it was upscale but we went some what casual during the week and we were fine. We had the calamari as an appetizer which was good. For dinner I had mushroom ravioli... best ravioli Ive ever had. My fiance had the gnocchi with spicy bolognese... was great. Our waiter Angel was extremely accommodating, very knowledgeable and didn't rush us even though we went in an hour before they closed. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great experience and amazing food. We will definitely be back!",

I ordered the vodka penne w/ chicken and my wife had one of the specials, filet tips and pasta in a mushroom sauce.  The salad, the bread and the desert (cheesecake) was good, even really good, but just fell short of great.  Except the service, that was great.  In short, if I'm in the area, it is a solid good meal with excellent service and I will go back.  One other thing worth mentioning, the restaurant was relatively empty when we went but for some reason they sat a crying baby right next to us.  There were many empty tables with no one around, any one of them would have been better than right next to us.",

    "text": "Another well-respected dining emporium that I have wanted to experience for years is Gaetano's.  I finally did so for a dinner out with Henderson friends.  After this delightful culinary experience, I can only ask, \"What took me so long?\"  This elegant ristorante delivered on all counts: great Northern Italian cooking; fine sophisticated service by formally clad dining staff; and excellent hospitality including a greeting and regular table checks by owner Gaetano Palmeri, who embodies the classic image of an experienced hands-on restaurateur with an eye for detail who clearly cares about pleasing his guests.  Not shy about tackling multiple courses at Italian restaurants, I opened with Calamari Fritti for the table, and the calamari was light and golden as desired, with a graciously supplied smooth and dynamite-quality Lemon Aioli per request, along with a tasty Marinara Sauce.  Although I intended to avoid extra carb loading, since I was soon to be leaving on a cruise, I nevertheless could not resist two warm buttered slices of fine Italian bread.  For soup I opted for a bowl of the special soup of the day: Cream of Mushroom Soup with Truffle Oil.  The velvety soup with beautifully pureed mushrooms was smooth and luscious.  I next split an excellent Caesar Salad with fresh Romaine leaves and Focaccia Croutons with the other male at our table, my optometrist friend.  After two bites I realized that I was missing my beloved anchovies in this dish.  So I immediately summoned our server, and in a flash anchovies were brandished in a dish (for an open food charge of just $1.00), and I happily regarded my Caesar as now truly complete.  Fork-tender Vitello Scallopina with great sweet Marsala Sauce was my main, accompanied by delectable Roasted Potatoes and somewhat hard but near al dente broccoli and carrots.  One of our party commented that he experienced the best Gnocchi he had ever tried, and his large Creme Brulee looked very appealing,  But, already filled up by the generous portions, I resisted joining in.  Maybe next time!  For, there will definitely be next times.",

BUT we still got greeted by the owner with professionalism - as if we, too, were dressed in suits.   I highly recommended the eggplant rolls ups... I still remember them to this day. (We haven't been back because we just had a baby.) The angel hair pasta was perfectly cooked! The eggplant was HOT and soft and had perfect amount of filling to eggplant ratio.   The prices on wines was just astonishingly LOW for a restaurant. You couldn't beat the \"mark up\" at any other restaurant! We got a bottle of wine that would've been $100 for only $65 here. That should be an enough reason to dine here. Ha",

Everybody in the team work really took time to take care our order so we can enjoy our food & drink better. We had such an amazing time to chill & enjoying the food. We were the last people who stayed at this restaurant & had a good conversation with the owner. He shared to us about his birthday coming tomorrow & invited us drinks for his birthday.

    "text": "Will never step foot into a place that has no respect for me as a customer.  Twice I came here, twice I was not served.  Flashback a few years ago I came with friends for if memory serves me correctly was a 7:00pm dinner.  We were told they are behind and will not be able to seat us for at least 15 minutes.  Near one hour passed and we did not get seated, thus we walked out and went somewhere else.  My brother asked me if I would like to try this place a few days before Xmas.  I told him, ok.  We made reservations on OpenTable for 8:15pm.  We arrived around 8:10, a few minute early.  We were not greeted by anyone.  The woman behind the counter remained on the phone without acknowledging for over five minutes.  When time came to talk with her, she was abrupt, she had the charm of Don Rickles on his worse behavior.  She told us we would have to wait \"a few more minutes.\"    At this point I am cool.  After 10 minutes go by I am still looking at the same patrons in place not being served or waited on.  They were clearly understaffed.  It is now 8:30pm and they tell us we are going to get seated now.  However, they made a mistake and had to sit someone else (note there is a 84 year old woman in my party who was never offered a seat or even mentioned that there was a bar she could sit down at).  It is now 8:44pm, 1/2 hour after reservations, this place is so badly understaffed that I noticed that people siting down 1/2 later were just getting their salads.  At this point I tell the two women at the counter that I am going somewhere else and this place is a joke.  They tell me now \"we are ready to seat you\" after I complained, but it is too late, we are going somewhere else.  I told them many of my friends work in the food industry and work with top chefs.  I told them if they cannot meet demand, then they should not waste my time advertising openings for online reservations when they cannot commit to the time frame stated.  A professional place would not accept reservations if they could not offer a great experienced to the diner.  There is that old adage about you never know who you are dealing with and apparently they did not know my connections.  I have driven tens of thousands of dollars of business to places by my word (I rarely use yelp) and when I tell people do not go to a place, no one I know will go.  To give a example of how a place should be run I will use Amada in Ocean Resort in Atlantic City, NJ.    <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/amada-atlantic-city-5\">yelp.com/biz/amada-atlan...</a>  I had the most miserable experience ever there and told the manager afterwards.  The manager insisted I come back the next day and anything I want is on the house.  I asked him anything?  He said anything, I could have run up a $500 bill and it would have been ok.  I would not do that out of respect. I came back the next day and everything was perfect.  It was so good I went back many times and became friends with staff members.",

The restaurant was fairly easy to find, located right on Eastern Ave., though you may miss it if looking, as there's another business that's in front of it (obscuring it from the street).  I liked the decor, it was simple but elegant.    It took our waiter a few minutes to stop by to review the nightly specials, but not excessive.  Our waiter was friendly and had helpful recommendations when prompted.    My wife ordered the rigatoni with a sausage meat-sauce, I ordered the chicken piccata.  My wife's dish could have used a tad more sauce, and I would have thought my dish would have come with a side of pasta of some kind.  While both our dishes were very tasty, portion sizes were smaller than I expected; perhaps Italian portion sizes are just smaller here in Vegas compared to what I'm used to (we're from Boston, where portion sizes are often too large).  I don't think the prices are unreasonable, but it would have been nice to get a bit more with our meal (even just a small side of pasta).  This restaurant deserves a 3.5 out of 5, but since I can't give it a half-star, I'm going to round up because I like to support local business over chain restaurants.",

The menu is elegant and authentic but there is not a lot of things that would stand out or have an unusually special taste. When ordering our food I asked for a wine that was not too tannic or fruit forward and alexande our waiter recommended a Sicilian red wine that was exactly what I wanted. A lot of people complained about portion size however me and my girlfriend got a split plate and with the appetizer and bread that was more then enough. It is definitely not a buffet and elegant dining facilities usually focus on the quality of the meal rather then quantity. The crowd was also a bit older then most Vegas restaurants but it is off the strip and we went on a Friday night. I would definitely go to this restaurant again if I was off the strip and wanted authentic Italian food and great wine with knowledgeable staff.",

    "text": "A real gem for the neighborhood. They have a super friendly wait staff and delicious food. You'll find all your Italian favorites, plus and abundance amount of daily specials.   The restaurant starts you off with fresh bruschetta for the table and a bread basket filled with house made tomato focaccia, accompanied by a small dish of oil and balsamic for dipping. Not a bad way to start while you look over the menu.  Squid Ink Risotto (a special): toothsome, fragrant, and rich in flavor. The squid were tender and moist, but the dish could have used a hint of lemon or some sorrel. The risotto itself was cooked very nicely.  Veal Parmigiana (with a request of vodka sauce instead of marinara): kudos to making excellent pasta. It was perfectly al dente and the vodka sauce was delicious. The veal was moist and tender, had a thin coat of breading, which is what I like, and topped with fresh mozzarella. It's a pretty solid dish, although I would have liked my veal sliced a little thicker.  My father in law had their pan seared trout, which came super fresh. It sat next to a bed of spaghetti and marinara, again perfectly cooked.   I wish we had room for dessert, which means we will have to come back again.",

The place was not very busy which was surprising for a Friday night but according to some of the other yelp reviews, not unusual.  We ordered the calamari & fried artichokes for our appetizers. The calamari was $13 & the portion was tiny. The fried artichokes were either canned or jarred artichokes which I could not believe. At a restaurant like that, it's completely ridiculous to use any kind of canned ingredients. My husband got the veal with mushrooms & I got one of their specials, Chilean Sea Bass. My husbands veal was nothing special & the sauce had a weird texture to it. My sea bass was good but the accompanying side of orzo with different veggies in some type of sauce was very boring & unimaginative.  Very forgettable meal & we won't be going back. I can think of at least 3 other Italian restaurants that blow this place out of the water.",

I have a standing date night with my friend from elementary school on Tuesday nights so we are always contemplating new places to eat that are b/w where he lives and my house.  We stumbled upon this place based on a Groupon they had offered, it had good reviews, so we decided to try it.  People were up a the bar watching the Heat finals, which looked rather comfortable, and has been added to my places to watch games that don't involve gambling. I ordered a dirty martini on the rocks [very good] he ordered a cranberry and vodka that came out looking like pink lemonade b/c they pour heavy here!!! {A+}  I got the Burrata salad which just makes me grin from ear to ear. My friend actually got the Gazpacho which shocked the shit out of me, as that was very daring for him, and he ate it all. I was allowed to have one tasty bite and that was it.  Bread basket arrived with all sorts of wholesome goodness in there-got to love carbs.  I ordered butternut squash ravioli and he got pork chop stuffed w/ Mortadella, cheese, pistachios, and raisins..It was pretty dang amazing. Mine was very good too. We left stuffed and happy.",

    "text": "Fantastic!!!!!!!!! It was my gf 's birthday and she wanted some fresh homemade pasta.  I did a little research and found Gaetano's on Yelp. They make their own Fettuchini and ravioli. I believe they may also make some other noodles but I'm not sure.   We were seated with one of the best waiters we've had in quite some time. His name is Jake. He was very knowledgable about the menu and helped us to make some selections which enabled us to try a number of different items from the menu without having to order 3-4 dinners. He also was pretty funny and made us laugh.   On to the food..... We ordered the grilled portabello mushroom appetizer which had a great smokey grilled taste and just the right amount of cheese. Delicious!!!! Next came our caesar salad for 2. The homemade caesar dressing is perfect. The appetizers and salads were also served with a lovely warm bread assortment with olive oil and balsamic vineger to dip into. Our main couses arrived a short time later...............Cioppino with homemade fettucini noodles and an order of assorted homemade ravioli. We also got a meatball on the side.   Gaetano and his wife both came by our table to be sure all was well and we were enjoying our meals. That's rare and much appreciated when the owners of a restaurant care enough to make contact with their customers.  This was a great first visit to Gaetano's and everthing was fantastic.!!!!!!!!!!!  We will definitely be returning to Gaetano's again for dinner.",

Resort to be off the strip (she's there a ton for work) and just cruised around Henderson on Yelp looking for Italian food. Gaetano's did not disappoint. It's not your spaghetti-and-meatballs-red-sauce place (though I'm guessing you can get it).  My pasta was perfectly cooked, the dish was interesting: gnocchetti (tiny little shells) with little sausages and broccoli rabe in a light garlic sauce. It was light and rich at the same time. The portion size was perfect. I didn't feel like I ate a manatee. The bread wasn't great, but it's a small issue. We had their house cabernet and it was excellent...just a hint of fruitiness and really smooth (I called it buttery, but \"smooth\" is probably a better word).  Friendly, helpful service, nice ambiance, nothing inventive. Listen, I'd love a brick building tucked away in some quiet downtown neighborhood with two dogs eating spaghetti out back, but I'm impressed that they've created a such a great restaurant right there in a strip mall.",

Also, while we don't expect the waitstaff to be superstars, we felt like we were imposing by asking for anything.  Generally, it was a poor experience. I'd have rather eaten a $5 burger at the Five Guys next door followed by a Pinkbox doughnut. I would have had speedier service and it would have cost a lot less.",

    "text": "I have heard nothing but good things about this restaurant. So when my GF saw a Groupon for it, we decided to try it out.   First impressions. The woman who greeted us at the door was the owner's wife. We arrived 30 minutes early. She sat us but overall, I wouldn't describe her as warm or welcoming.  Maybe she was having a bad night, who knows. But leave your negativity at the back door.    It's a very nice looking restaurant. Warm colors, romantic lighting, but there is somewhat of a sterile feeling.  The server Zack was great. He was very accommodating to my GF's dietary restrictions and was very friendly. All of the other service staff including the owner' son were also friendly and service was very smooth.   The food: the bread that comes out I delicious, dangerously delicious. There is a pizza type of bread that has marinara and cheese. The texture was light as air. The other bread was equally as good.   There is a Yelp check in offer for a complementary Bruschetta. The flavors were great but the tomato mixture was ice cold.  I ordered the Brodetto. The flavors were also very good but Brodetto means broth and the sauce was more of a marinara sauce thickness not a broth by any means.  I had the Ossobuco Milanese. It was very delicious. The saffron risotto was perfectly cooked and a perfect compliment for the Ossobuco.  They have gluten free pasta, which is great for people who eat gluten free like my significant other. They served it with a mushroom cream sauce which she enjoyed.  During our dining experience, we noticed the owner Gaetano walking around talking to all of the regulars. When he did stop by our table, it seemed like it was almost forced. He barely looked us in the eyes. Not exactly the warm welcome we expected for patronizing his restaurant.   In the end, we asked for our check, when the owner's wife presented the check she told us gratuity was included. Not only that, but the gratuity was added on the after tax total, not the before tax subtotal. This is just tacky. Not something you should do to locals trying out your restaurant for the first time. Yes it says they add gratuity on the Groupon but, Groupon  also says to make sure you tip off the non-discounted total.  Since Zack and the staff were so great, I added more to make it an even 20%, which is what he deserved. I think a party of 2 shouldn't have their gratuity added. This left a very bitter feeling towards this restaurant. Just writing about their auto gratuity policy is getting me mad.   It seems this restaurant has all the right makings of something great. Its nice looking, has good food, friendly staff.  But the owner's attitudes and policies ultimately leave the final impression of this place something to be desired.  As a local restaurant, you should try to make sure your customers come back and feel welcomed.  WE won't be back and won't recommend this place to anyone  P.S. Please look at the 29 reviews not recommended at the bottom of their page. They are an eye opening look into how the owners treat their patrons. I don't know why Yelp doesn't recommend them but please read them!",

    "text": "Over years (more than two decades now), during my visits to Vegas, I've tried to find the best Italian food.  It seemed like it was what Vegas did best.  Long before Yelp, Zagat's (when they only had books) put me onto Gaetano's, but it took me a long time to get out here.  After finally making it to Gaetano's, I haven't tried another Italian place -- and I've returned to Gaetano's on every visit to Vegas.  Every meal has been outstanding.  I've even stopped visits to Nora's (I'm going to have to change that, Nora's is excellent too, though different.  Gaetano's is more \"fine dining\".  Nora's is a bit more casual -- though the difference may not be all that big to some).  I opt for traditional entrees.  I've had fish, venison, and the best duck breast I've ever had (it's easy to overcook the the duck).  Friends like the pastas.  The butternut squash ravioli have converted me.  Recently, my entree had sweet potato ravioli that was even better.  We love to get the spaghetti and meatballs for an appetizer.  They're not on the menu, but they're always available.  Meatballs made with fillet covered in a rich sauce.  My New York friends who I had to beg to try Gaetano's (\"we get great Italian at home, there's nothing youse guys can do out here as good as back in Brooklyn\") say it's some of the best they've had.  Service is impeccable.  We miss the departure of Danny who always took great care of us, but every other server is just as good.  The prices are not out of alignment with the Strip or where I live (Northern California).  I can see how those who like the Olive Garden might find Gaetano's pricy.  For those who like Olive Garden and are looking for a bargain, let me suggest Battista's Hole in the Wall down on Flamingo.  I think you'll find it much more agreeable than Gaetano's.",

I made a dinner reservation and the host was pretty efficient and we were seated quickly.   Our server was a bit slow. We waited about 7-10 minutes before anyone came to bring us menus or water. I've never really had that happen before and didn't know who our server was at the time as no one came to our table to greet us. I noticed throughout our dinner that service should be good for the most part, depending on who your server is.   Food:   Lamp chops- Delicious. I thought this was a nicely executed dish. Flavors were there and the lamb was done just right. I often encounter lamb overcooked so it became tough. This one was cooked properly and was still tender.   Thin slices of veal topped with grilled eggplant- I tried a bite or two of this but personally didn't find it very memorable. It was just okay.  Linguine pasta with clams in a red sauce- Tried a few bites. Another decent dish but not overly memorable. The clams were pretty good.   Tiramisu- Pretty good. I do love tiramisu and this one didn't disappoint. Favorite dessert of the 3.   Creme brulee- Not bad. Not overly eggy. I wasn't blown away but I also wasn't disappointed.   Cheesecake- Not bad either. Again, not blown away but also not disappointment.   Overall, I think it was a nice dinner. I think our server was a bit too slow considering the place was half full. I can't imagine what it would be like if it were a full house. Service did pick up a bit when other servers came to offer bread and fill up water. It has potential to be much better.   Would I come here again? Maybe. Food is pretty good. Service has potential to be good with the right server.",

    "text": "I have been here multiple times, all from getting their groupon.  The food always tastes good, most of the time I get the calamari and the Mezzelune di Vitello con Porcini, a veal stuffed pasta in a cream sauce with mushrooms, peas, and prosciutto.   The only times where I was disappointed with the food was when I got the caesar salad and another time I got a cannoli. The dressing for the caesar was very underwhelming, with most of the salad consisting of the more stalky parts of romaine. The cannoli cream in the cannoli wasn't smooth and creamy, I guess they used ricotta so it was chunky and pasty/gritty.  The service is always top notch. I am always offered more bread, red sauce if I don't want the oil and vinegar that normally comes with it, I am always seated and served promptly, and my drink always remained full. The waiters are always knowledgeable about the menu and are always friendly.  My only main complaint with the place is the portion size of the dishes in combination with the price. It isn't so bad since I am paying half price with the groupon, but I would most likely feel ripped off if I was paying full price. The calamari is 13 bucks and barely  fills half the plate, especially since the other half is used for the saucer of marinara that comes with it. The veal stuffed pasta comes to 19 bucks, and it was never filling. While it always tastes awesome, the pasta never has that much filling in it, and there is never more than 10 of them on the plate, perfectly spaced out to cover the plate. If you are paying almost 20 dollars for a pasta dish, you should leave feeling full and satisfied, not continually asking for more bread and carbonated soda to not leave hungry.  The food is good, at least the things I consistently get like the pasta and calamari. I just wish there was more on the plate for the price they are asking. As long as they offer a groupon here, I will keep coming. I would never pay full price for this place.",

    "text": "Great little place (way) off the strip, I love italian food, and this place wasn't too bad. I came here with my girlfriend and split a carpaccio dish, veal with shiitake mushrooms, and a gnocchi dish with her. I don't eat veal a lot, but I was a little surprised at how it came out; the sauce and mushrooms were great, along with the steamed vegetables and mashed potatoes it came with, but for some reason the veal just wasn't what I was picturing in my head. Don't let that deter you though, that might just be how veal is, and I didn't know it.   The gnocchi was excellent, very flavorful with the gorgonzola sauce, and it was hard to stop eating even though I was already stuffed.   The waitstaff were excellent as well! Our personal waiter wasn't that friendly and seemed a little scatterbrained, but all the other people on the floor more than made up for it. I'm pretty sure some of the people that stopped to talk to us were either the owner or the manager. and the hostess was most helpful in calling a cab for us and then letting us know when it arrived.",

The service is more on top of things than almost anywhere I've been, and without an attitude may I add. My wife never had to ask for more water a single time.  My wife got there Veal Picatta, and I got the Gnocchi with tomato basil sauce.  My wife is a veal snob, and absolutely loved theirs.  The Gnocchi is absolutely perfect and the sauce has good flavor.  I don't often rate food, but this place impressed me more than usual. The setting is quiet for the most part and feels romantic if need be. The prices are honestly set where they should be for the quality of the food.",

    "text": "I'll start by stating that this restaurant is elegant. The host was very friendly and accommodating. Every table was nicely set up with linens. The decor and layout inside the restaurant is very well thought out.   Loud was the first word that entered my mind when we walked through the door! We noticed that the bar area was separated by glass, so we kindly asked the hostess if we could sit at a table in the bar area! She walked us to bar area and kindly suggested that we choose a table! There was literally no one in the bar, so there were numerous empty tables.   Let's briefly talk about the food! I'll say above average, but not phenomenal! There's an Italian restaurant down the street that's slightly cozier with an excellent menu and very friendly staff.  Now let's talk about the service. Here's where my opinion goes South. And... I'll get straight to the point. We presented a Yelp coupon for free bruschetta and the mood changed! The bartender's mood to be exact. We check in on Yelp everywhere we go! We're avid Yelpers! It's fun! We love it! We attend the events. So... when a Yelp coupon pops up upon check in, we use it. We always tip on the original amount.   So servers and bartenders, please don't be upset about coupons and specials. Your restaurant owners/mangers and marketing teams put them out there for people to use. If the experience is good, many of these people will come back. Just my opinion.   I probably won't be back here. There are so many restaurants to choose from in this city. I want to fee comfortable while I'm dining out.",

    "text": "This is a fantastic authentic Italian restaurant in Henderson, Nevada. The delightful greeting that I received by the owner's wife, after walking through the door made me feel great. She's the manager and a proud American of Italian descent and the owner Gaetano is an Italian national, born and raised in the Southern Italian region of Sicily. Which is really cool, because my maternal great-grandparents came from Sicily. Gaetano's wife is Northern Italian and that's why Gaetano decided to make this place specifically a Northern Italian restaurant.   I really enjoyed the caprese salad as an appetizer and chicken picata for dinner. The son of Gaetano is a waiter there and he's a little reserved, but that's fine. I didn't trip on that too much. It still felt great being around my people.",

(Although a great description for people trying to locate it, as it is a bit hidden.)   We were put onto this place by a wonderful couple we shared a table with at Eataly. They were eastcoasters turned locals and Italian so obviously we had to ask what some of their favorite Italian places were in town. Gaetano's topped their list for places in Henderson and boy were they right.   We went in on a rainy night and sat at the bar. I ordered their housemade gnocchi (made fresh daily in house) with their vodka pink sauce. Those pasta pillows just melted in my mouth. Some of the best gnocchi I've ever had. My husband had the lasagna and a meatball. Came out piping hot and fantastic. Also, their bread basket was varied and excellent, which is always a plus. I love when bread baskets come with a couple different types of bread. The wine selection is awesome as well.   Staff was super friendly and attentive. Seems like a place you could frequent and become acquainted with the employees and owner.   Finding good date night spots is always tricky in this area so definitely add this to your place to check out!",

For dinner, I ordered the lasagna ($19) which was very light for lasagna. The pasta seemed thin! I wanted the chicken parm originally but I thought $28 seemed incredibly high. With the quality of everything else we had, I'm not sure why it would cost that much but I'm glad I went with the lasagna.  For dessert, I ordered apple pie and it wasn't very good. It tasted like grocery store quality.   The atmosphere was quiet and dim...with an older crowd. Overall, the food was okay but the service was super slow and the employees weren't that friendly. With so many restaurants in the area, I won't be back.",

When I looked up the restaurant online, a Gaetano's Groupon ad popped up so I purchased the Groupon and made plans to visit for my celebration. Based on Trip Advisor and Yelp, the attire was listed as casual. When I arrived, I saw several people in t-shirts and one person in shorts. I arrived wearing a tank top and a skirt. My boyfriend arrived 5 minutes later (driving over 30 minutes from north Summerlin to meet me for my birthday dinner), and also wore a tank top because it was 110 degrees outside. No crazy patterns or vulgar words were on our tanks, but we were asked to leave for wearing tank tops. I asked if there was any way we could please stay for dinner (the place wasn't super busy) and the owner was very rude and adamant we need to leave. It was embarrassing having to get up from my table after already being provided with water and having a napkin placed on my lap to walk to the exit. I'll post a picture of how I was dressed (my boyfriend was in a tank too). We went to Vegenation nearby to celebrate my birthday and we were received warmly. Don't think I can get a refund on my Groupon any more but if anyone wants it for the value purchased, I'll pass it on. I don't feel comfortable returning with the way the staff spoke to us/regarded us.",

Our waiter Nick didn't even skip a beat when we inquired if we needed to save our free bruschetta with yelp check in for another visit since we had a Groupon. He was polite and confirmed we couldn't combine offers and continued on to give us excellent recommendations and drink pairings with the specials and regular menu items. He knew it was our anniversary and surprised us with a comped tiramisu that was to die for. The prosciutto goat cheese figs were amazing btw, as was the list of other items we ordered.

    "text": "We decided on Gaetano's for dinner as I had been wanting Italian for a while. We got there right as they opened, so there was no wait. The dining room is cavernous and very well decorated. Of note is it seems the owners take cruises - due to some of the artwork. Nice white tablecloths and well-appointed servers show this is a serious Italian place. Sadly, I cannot remember our servers names, but they were fantastic. We never had to seek them out and they were always around to care for our table.   We started with an appetizer that they were featuring that night. Fresh mozzarella with greens and tomatoes and a balsamic reduction. The mozz was certainly fresh and worked very well with the greens and balsamic. I am not much for tomatoes, co the wife took one for the team and had those while I made up for it with the greens.   For our entrees, I went with the lasagna and the wife had the Mussels and Clams Brodetto. The lasagna was very good, with soft noodles, creamy bechamel and good red sauce. It lacked a bit on meat (it is listed as Bolognese) and cheese topping. It is served in the usual casserole dish - a little trick here: use some water to wet the doily....it will keep the dish from sliding around. It appears to be constructed in the dish itself, which could lead to why it wasn't spectacular. I am used to layers: pasta, meat, sauce, cheese, pasta, meat, sauce, cheese...etc. This had layers, but it ended up blended together in such a way as to be an amalgamation. Again, a tick more meat in the red sauce and some cheese on top would have moved it to the next level.  The brodetto was great. A nice big bowl with mussels and clams swimming in a great seafood broth. Granted, this was an app she ordered as her entree, it stepped up to fill the roll nicely. There were about a half dozen each of the shellfish. The broth was warm, silky and loaded with seafood flavor. It was almost too flavorful...almost.  There is nothing like dunking toasted bread in seafood broth after eating everything else!  We are intrigued about their eggplant dish and how well they do with their rigatoni. For that we will be back. This is certainly not a place to go to just to get some grub. Go when you want to have a nice Italian dinner in a nice place with some nice people.",

If they had actually made some kind of impression with the food I would have not bothered with writing this. However, this was the worst ever.......eeeeeever.

The hostess greeted me and asked how many in my party? I answered four, two adults, two children. After finding out my children were young, she asked me if I would like to be put in a corner. I promptly responded,  \"No, why?\" She said, \"Well kids run around, scream, and can be disruptive.\" I said, \"Well, my kids behave so I'm not really worried.\" Then, if that wasn't enough, she stated, \"I just don't want you to be embarrassed.\" Oh my! That was just the beginning. The waiter, Angel, was condescending and did not offer any help when it came to the kids' selections. We ended up paying $16.00 per plate for spaghetti yet the adult portion was $18.95. Talk about a big rip off! We ended up paying $20.00 per child which included drinks. There was a gentleman circulating amongst guests but never said boo to us. The food was not extraordinary as previous reviews have stated. There are many Italian restaurants to be insulted and eat marginal food! We will NEVER be back!",

    "text": "I visited Gaetano's Ristorante, looking to use the Groupon I'd received as a gift. I spoke with the owner's son, Nick (the name I was given when I called), told him of my Groupon and asked if I could order to go. Nick rudely says, \"No you can't! It says that on the Groupon.\" I paused because I'd never been spoken to like that at a restaurant. I then asked if I could use my Groupon now because I didn't make a reservation and he says, \"Oh, you want to eat now?\" After I tell him yes, (if I could get a table), he gives me this lecture... \"Just to let you know you can't take any food to go, you actually have to sit down and eat it, that's what it says on the Groupon, so if you try to take any food home, we won't let you!\" I told him, \"Ok! I get it!\" I looked at the little older woman standing next to him to see what his problem was and she wouldn't meet my eye. How could you treat one of your customers like this? I literally felt like I didn't belong there and Nick made it quite clear that he felt the same way. I sat at a table by myself wanting to cry. I did absolute nothing wrong except try to redeem a Groupon. How dare he treat me like I'm nothing?! I'm a person that deserves to be treated like a human! I've contacted Groupon to get a refund because I don't want to go through that again. I hated that experience. If he treated me like sh**, I can't imagine how he treats his employees. I get your mommy or daddy owns the place, but you have no right to treat your customers like they're beneath you. I'm sure their food is fantastic, but I never got to that part because I left. The best part of that experience was the waitress that treated me like I was worth something. She was really sweet to me when she saw that I was upset; I almost wanted to come back after I spoke with her and I wish I could remember her name. I don't know who treats people the way the owner's son treated me today, but I will NEVER come here again.",

However, nothing is like a night out on the town dressed up with Blair B., her husband Mike B., and Eric R.!

The coupon includes alcohol.  Mike B. proudly picked the wine with his wine app, so I said we would go with it.  It was okay, but since Blair already said it wasn't her favorite, I will go ahead and agree (I am not much for red wine but did it for my heart, baby!)  We started off with complementary bruschetta, bread and olive oil/basalmic, and the wine.  Gaetano himself gave us the specials, and there were like 42 of them.  Our waiter finally reviewed them with us (though a few were sold out) and we were more confused (the menu is already big as it is).  I ended up getting the butternut squash ravioli with sage and brown butter, and magnificent it was!  The beef carpaccio appetizer was also delicious and at least I can say our waters were refilled rapidly.  Eric R. ordered a veal dish as his main and a half order of the special risotto of the day, bay scallop and shiitake.  It was outstanding and I couldn't stop eating it.  To top it off, my friend Nick sent over via our waiter complementary \"house cappucinos\" which were essentially hot bittersweet chocolate with 3ish liqueurs and topped with whipped cream.  Eric R. was skeptical because he hates coffee and when he tried it, he was relieved.  YUM!",

    "text": "Came here one night because we had a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate and it was so close to our home.  There were some hits and misses in this meal but the hits were really exceptional.  A lot of people here gush at the laundry list of specials they have every day, but there were so many of them, it was difficult to remember.  I wished they would take the effort to print a daily special menu.  I felt like I should have brought a pen and paper with me to take notes as the waiter recited all the specials.  We ordered the arugula and beet and the Mediterranean salads off the specials menu.  Between the bread (homemade fococcia, yum) and the salad being so big, I was full by the time the main course appeared at the table.  The salads are expensive at like $14 or so, but I don't think they are meant to be eaten alone.  I wished they would slash the price and scale down the salads, as $14 for an appetizer salad is too expensive.  They were both very good, just too much.  We also split a half order of the homemade spinach and cheese ravioli with marinara sauce, it was one of the highlights of the meal.  Really exceptional.    I ordered the Hawaiian pink snapper special and my husband had the gnocchi.  The snapper was good but didn't think it was worth the $27 they charged for it.  It's the first time I've ever eaten that type fish, and maybe I'm naive as to how much the fish costs to bring in the area, but it wasn't a memorable dish.  A few weeks before I had the sea bass and risotto from Brand and felt that was a much more well cooked dish than this.  The potatoes with the meal had no seasoning (at $27 dollars I would expect the seasoning to be spot on) but the asparagus was very good.  Husband had the gnocchi and said it was nowhere in the same league as the ravioli, and while it was good, would not order it again over the ravioli.  I would come here again, as there is so much variety and the food is very fresh.  But we'll order less food.",

The atmosphere is top notch.  Every place setting was perfectly laid out, and the tables were close enough to be intimate but not so close that you were rubbing elbows with strangers.  The calamari was tender and breaded to perfection.  The 75 dollar tasting menu with matching wines is exactly what all tasting menus should be.  Lots of food, thoughtfully prepared with exceptional ingredients.  The wines were exceptional and complimented the food to a tee.  Great for dates, romantic without being TOO romantic.  I say this is an excellent place for a group of adults, a first date or a married couple out for a nice meal but don't want to spend 150 a person.  The wait staff was attentive without being overbearing and they answered every question my date had.  Highly recommended.",

    "text": "My favorite food is Italian food.  This is a problem as I have invested a great deal of time in trying different Italian restaurants, and after a few years, have not successfully found ones with decent quality.    Just for you to understand my quality level, Maggiano's, an Italian restaurant chain is the bare minimum standard for Italian food.  If I am desperate and want Italian food, I will reluctantly go there..  Macaroni Grill is crap, Olive garden is a joke.  Please don't get me started on CPK.   Additionally, I only rate food.  I don't care about the environment, if it's hot or cold, if I'm getting hot flashes or not.  I will eat quality food in a blizzard, so long as the arctic winds do not compromise the taste of the food.    The food is good.  Al dente pasta, tasty.  Very well done.  Service was excellent as well - not that I care about service, but merely pointing it out as a noticeable fact, as 7 different waiters and 4 busboys asked me if there was anything I required.  There have been 2 other restaurants that I have discovered that is just as good.  And both of them are in California.  I have eaten at B&B and it PALES in comparison to Gaetano's.  Sorry Mario Batale, maybe your sou chef was off that night, but I was not pleased with the quality of food.  I recommend you come here.  The fact that this restaurant is not 5 stars by others makes me wonder - do people not have taste buds?",

    "text": "So i decided to stop here for a late night meal with a friend after a workout anout 40 min before they closed. First look in i realized i wasnt dressed properly but a server sat us anyways after giving us the are u serious look wearing jean shorts and a fight hoodie in here... lol I liked our server Danny even though we could tell he wasnt excited to be getting a table this late but he gave us a great menu rap, accent and all. I appreciated his enthousiasm even if it was a little forced. We ordered a glass of wine and a beer and they dropped off bread service for us. Bread was a bit tasteless and not exciting. 3  different types but pretty plain. When our food came out i was happy with my spagetti and meatballs, (was craving carbs after workout) good flavor and just enough sauce for me. The spagetti noodles where done perfect as well. She ordered the bolangese and enjoyed it but likes more sauce with her pasta. Daniel came to check on us and she said she was fine but he could tell she wasnt really happy so he asked her whats up and she mentioned she likes more sauce in here pastas but it was no big deal. He told her to hold on a moment and he would take care of it and moments later they sent out a small dish of piping hot sauce. No attitude or problems, just answers. That impresses us both the most. He didnt sacrifice service because of how late it was or how we were dressed. We will definetly be back just based on service and how good our entree dishes were. Great all around experience.",

    "text": "I scheduled a birthday dinner here last minute due to unmet needs at another restaurant. Never been there until that night, but I heard from my supervisor that the food is really good. I can celled my other reservation and called them to see if they could take my group on such a short notice. When I called, I spoke to the manager who was completely understanding and helped me set up the reservation. I ended up being really satisfied! 1. They accommodated me and my guests and 2. They were genuinely nice to my friends and me. I really enjoyed my dinner here. I brought a cake with me and they lit the candles and brought it out to me. As well as cut the cake and served it. They really do care about their customers here. It's more like family here. The food was really good too. I had penne pasta which was really tasty and cooked just right. I still hear from my guests that they enjoyed the food and service here and this was a year ago! At the time, they were able to split checks. Which is one of the reasons why I dumped the other place. They tried to pull a quick one on me and tell me they couldn't do it the day of my dinner, even though previously they said they would. I am SO glad I chose to go to Gaetano's! I would definitely recommend this place. It's not cheap, but it's really good and the workers are super nice!",

    "text": "While the atmosphere was very nice at this restaurant, the food was really just fair at best and our overall experience here was extremely disappointing.  For an upscale Italian restaurant we expected much more. We got there at 6:30pm when there were just a few other parties there, however the service was still VERY slow.  We had a concert to attend at 8pm and thought we gave ourselves plenty of time, but after an hour there we were STILL waiting for our entrees we had ordered about 45 minutes before.  The salad we ordered before the meal was completely tasteless.  We asked for balsamic vinegar to drizzle on it to give it some semblance of flavor.  On top of that, my date does not like avocados but I do, so I asked for them on the side.  Our waiter said, \"we can just put it on two plates for you\".  Imagine my surprise when the bill came and our tasteless and small salad cost us $14.95!  He neglected to tell us that he was going to put a whopping $5 split charge on our $9.95 salad. It was a sneaky and deceptive charge that left a very poor taste in our mouth!  I understand that when you split an entree that a split charge is normal, but a small pre-dinner salad that was way overpriced to begin with? And then when it is split at your waiter's suggestion on top of that? And you also don't tell us about the split charge?  Just plain sneaky and dishonest, in my opinion.  My date also had their fettuccine alfredo, and while the homemade pasta was good, the sauce was very heavy and once again, fairly tasteless.  My chicken picatta was decent, but was just a notch or two above what you would expect to get at any garden variety Italian restaurant in the Olive Garden price range.  Once the bill came we were running late for our concert so I didn't have time to dispute the split charge, but due to our use of a $25 gift certificate, the waiter had put a whopping 20% auto-grat charge on the pre-discounted total, and once again neglected to tell he had done so (in what is in my opinion, a shameless and dishonest attempt to have people double tip).  I understand auto-grat with larger parties or with discounted meals, but 20%? And then you don't tell the customer? Needless to say, we will NEVER dine there again, and this review will hopefully prevent many others from sharing our very poor experience at this place!",

You do not have to buy the coupon up front. I get to eat at some of the top restaurants in town and you would easily pay well over $200 for the meal I had. Our bill came out to $143 including tip. My date had a lobster dish that was done to perfection. The lobster was tender and delicious. I had the butternut ravioli that was good but not over the top. The meal was complete with appetizer, salad, 4 glasses of decent wine, two main dishes, desert and two after dinner drinks. Yes, you can eat for a lot less but I wasn't holding back and it was every bit as good from beginning to end. I was seriously happy with this place and I would go back.",

The place is beautifully decorated. The menu had amazing choices.  We had bread, calamari for an appetizer, I had the special Stuffed Salmon with crabmeat and my husband have Ribeye and my daughter had penne pasta with butter and a side of veggies.  My husbands drinks were reasonalbly priced and the staff was very attentive.  The son of the owners was the waiter and had a wonderful personality.  We had a wonderful experience here and will go back again without my daughter.

    "text": "I was delighted to learn Gaetano's Ristorante is owned and operated by the same family that owned Gaetano's in Calabasas, CA - a long time favorite! The interior is beautiful, charming and romantic. I tried to go into a complicated description of the type of \"Skinny Cosmo\" I wanted, and I was told they already have one I could try to see if I liked it. It was perfect. My husband's martini with a twist was also properly prepared; the twist wasn't just added to the glass - the vodka was infused with the lemon oil. Now to the food: I ordered the special gazpacho, and it was delicious. It tasted like a farmers' market on a spring afternoon. My husband ordered spaghetti and meatballs because, you know, if they can't do that right it isn't good. The meatballs had an incredible flavor, and the sauce was seasoned and cooked perfectly. My risotto special (chicken and asparagus) was about as close to heaven as I could have imagined. We had tartufo (pistachio and dark chocolate) for dessert. The wine list is expansive and \"fair\", meaning there is something for everyone from someone who just wants a glass of house wine to the wine connoisseur who needs to pair the wine specifically with the food. I cannot wait to go back; the return trip will be soon!",

    "text": "I visited this establishment on April Fool's Day, 2013, to redeem a Groupon I had purchased over a year ago; needless to say, the promotional value had expired hehe  The decor and layout was upscale and I was instantly impressed.  I was seated at a corner table between the bar and the dining area which turned out to be a very high traffic area for the servers.  There were people flying behind me throughout the evening, putting orders in at the bar and returning with drinks.  I should have asked for a different seat.    I ordered the \"Trancia di Salmone alla Senape,\" (Pan seared filet of salmon with shallots and a dijon mustard sauce) which, if you're looking at the menu is the 2nd item at the top on a right hand page.  I pointed directly at the item I wanted and even attempted to pronouce it lol  (that was fun!)  10-15 minutes later, the server returns and states he forgot to ask how I wanted the meat prepared.  This should have been a red flag!  However, I was taken aback as I've never had anyone ask me how I'd like my salmon cooked.  I quickly replied, \"Well done.\"  He looked back at me, almost shocked, and asked, \"So you don't want any red in it?\"  I replied, definitely not.  15 minutes later or so, the server returns and apologizes for the wait, stating the meat takes longer to prepare well done.  I understood and was astonishingly patient.    My food finally arrives after 30 minutes or so, and I looked at the meat and it looked burnt.  I thought, \"Oh... this is what well done salmon looks like. \" I began to eat and noticed the meat was good but definitely WAS NOT fish.  I had no more than 3 bites and called the server back and politely asked, \"Is this salmon?\"  He replied, \"Oh, I thought you ordered the steak filet?\"  I quickly grabbed the menu and re-pointed to what I had previously ordered.  He asked if I wanted to keep the food as he went back to order what I had asked for.  I replied, \"No thank you\" and he took the filet mignon back.    Five minutes later, the owner is in my face.  He was rude and was like, \"How can you not tell the difference between salmon and steak?!  I mean, their two different kinds of meat!\"  He was pissed and I would be too however the fact that he came at me accusatory and rude left a hugely sour taste in my mouth.  He basically came across as if I had ordered one thing and then changed my mind once the food arrived.  What was brought to me was way at the bottom of the same page I ordered from so there should have been no confusion.  Had it not been for the server ADMITTING his fault, the owner would have continued to verbally assault me.  I should have been more embarrassed by the situation, but, as they walked away, all I could do was laugh because I knew I had nothing to do with the mix up.  It was the way the owner handled the situation that cemented my decision to never to eat at this establishment again, even though the food was delicious.  30 minutes later, my salmon arrived.    The icing on the cake was when they charged me AUTOGRATUITY, totalling $5.84.  The service certainly did not warrant such a tip and the fact that the owner made NO attempt to remedy the hour long wait for my food or his rudeness was beyond poor customer service.  In closing, if Groupon was giving away free $40 vouchers to eat at Gaetano's, I would, without question, have to decline.  Good food must never trump great service; and if the poor service I received that night was an April Fool's joke, I definitely was not amused!  You've been warned =)",

Very fresh and tasted good.  I still like the Buca di Beppo tiramisu; better value.  Service was good; just disappointed that no one wished us a \"happy anniversary\" when we stated it on our reservation. Without a Groupon, it might be a little overpriced.  Chicken Parm was $24. One canoli was $4.95.",

It was ok - but again nothing special.  Pork breaded and wrapped with something.  Just wasn't great.  Also ordered a side of spaghetti and marinara.  Nothing special - again.  Dessert was apple pie a la mode.  That was actually very nice.  Rich, flaky, great crust.  Not sure this place can justify the prices without a bit more flavor.",

Anyone who comes in is treated like a guest who entered the living room and is welcome to come into the dining room. Hey guest! What are you doing in the kitchen! (Just kidding, but don't go into the kitchen).   The food is astoundingly good and puts other 'family style italian gardens' absolutely to shame. I don't care how many plates of food those places throw at you, you only need one plate of Gaetano's and you'll have some to take home. They'll do birthdays, parties or just dinner. No matter what, make a reservation. They won't let the place get crowded enough that you can't get service.   The bar is wonderful. My sister-in-law and I spent an entire night making up martinis with the bartender. It was so much fun. The bartenders are totally engaging and enjoy making new and interesting drinks.  Go and enjoy Gaetano's. Get the espresso to end the meal and have a drink after at the bar. Its a wonderful establishment and you feel good the minute you walk in the door.",

    "text": "My son and I were here to celebrate his 19th birthday. Each year we go to a different Italian restaurant in town . . .  I don't even know where to start....  When we entered the restaurant we were greeted by an older lady who was the hostess. She gave us the once over and a disapproving look and the way she spoke, was \"snooty\". We were seated at a little two top table in the corner of the restaurant even though there were plenty of larger tables as the restaurant was not busy.  The server assistant brought us each water. After maybe 5 minutes the waiter came by and rattled off the specialty items. He also had quite the \"attitude\". We were ready to order about 5 minutes later, but just sat there. After about 20 minutes another waiter came and took our order. The server assistant refilled our drinks, brought us the bread, brought us the food, cleared our dishes, brought us our dessert, The waiter reappeared after we were done eating to ask us how everything was. The hostess \"almost\" redeemed herself by giving us a faint smile when she brought me the check.  I have never been treated so shitty by any staff at any restaurant. I'm in my mid-50's and have been to hundreds of restaurants. Even my son was irritated and thought they were extremely rude. He is majoring in Culinary in school himself.  The food itself was pretty good. My son had the chicken parmigiana and he liked it. I had the Chicken Ravioli with Pesto Cream Sauce. The ravioli was good but I was NOT a fan of the sauce. It was way too thick, not what I would call a cream sauce at all.  The highlight of the whole meal were the desserts. My son had the Tiramisu and I had the cannoli. They were both VERY good.  By the time the meal was over, I had really wished I had cash on me because believe me, I would have tipped the server assistant and stiffed the douche bag waiter. Unfortunately, though, I didn't. I debated not leaving a tip at all but then decided to leave a 25% tip in hopes that maybe it would \"maybe\" make the waiter feel like a bit of an jerk. With his personality though, it was probably a moot point.  Funniest part was, that I probably make more money than any of those people dining in there do.  I have NEVER been treated so poorly by someone in my life.  We will NEVER go back and I feel bad because we were there to celebrate my son's birthday and it was such a miserable experience.",

When the last person got there he came and rambled off the specials very fast and we barely saw him the rest of the night. The other reviews are True when they say the owners seem to stand in the corner and stare at you.   The food was ok, nothing special. It took FOREVER to come. Then we waited forever to get our check.

He stopped by to check on our table to see how we were doing and was genuinely engaging. The wait staff is extremely attentive  and very helpful. Our waiter Nick named all the specials of the day and was very professional. I always try to order something different when I come here and I am always pleased with whatever I try. Quality is a high priority here and you can taste the it! The chicken Alfredo may sound simple, but oh boy it something special here! The pasta is tender and fresh. The sauce is buttery and cheesy. Yum! I tried the eggplant rotoline (spelling) and it was tasty too. It was grilled eggplant stuffed with Angel hair pasta with red sauce and melted cheese on top. The calamari is tender and so far the best I've tried in town. This is a great place for dates and special nights out. The place is classy, but not pretentious. You don't have to wear a suite, but dressy casual would be a good way to describe the attire. There is also a bar on the right hand side separated by a wall from the dining room, so that's nice of you want to watch a sports game and have dinner with a drink. You can also end dinner with a delicious desert and a cappuccino.  I really like going here and I highly recommend checking this place out.",

I would definitely say that this is a great date night place, but not really for young families! We had great service until our food arrived, then our server kind of went missing.   The owners (I assume) were very kind and came around asking how things were and were awesome! My husband went outside with our son and the owner took my husbands food to the kitchen and reheated it for him.   No kids menu available here.   They did bring out the food quickly though!",

    "text": "4-17-2017  I went to Gaetano's on a Monday around 5:15pm. I was greeted immediately by a man impeccably dressed and very friendly and seated in an area that I requested.  There was a couple seated near me at the bar watching and discussing the hockey game on TV and I was impressed with the knowledge of the bartender and the patrons about hockey and enjoyed listening to their discussion.  I was immediately tended to with a menu and  my drink order was given.  The servers tended to my every need and seemed to appear as if they were reading my mind.  I was very impressed with the timing of the servers.  I had a Groupon that I paid $20 for $40 worth of food, which I thought was a great bargain.  I ordered the fried Zucchini as a appetizer and Lasagna with an order of Garlic Bread (as I found out that they did not serve Garlic Bread with Lasagna) but did serve a complimentary basket of toasted bread but it's not what I was hungry for.  I was brought a plate that had 5 small deep fried pieces that was not the Zucchini \"chips\" I was expecting but they were more like fried mozzarella and not wanting to question their version of fried zucchini, and wanting to sample what they brought, I ate the \"zucchini\".  It was nothing like what I was used to and I I was not impressed.  My Lasagna arrived just as I polished  off the appetizer.  It looked delicious.  It turned out to have one small layer of meat topped with pasta and cheese and it tasted more of pasta, with very little flavor until I  requested some red pepper flakes to give the dish  some dash.  I must admit that I have not eaten very much Italian food other that what is made at home in the Midwest, but I was not impressed with the food.  Like I said the servers were great, the atmosphere was nice and the restaurant was very clean and pleasant.  I just can't say with all honesty, that I found the food to be that good.  They seemed to have some very nice wine which the other customers seemed to enjoy.  My tab came to $44.00 ( $4 over the Groupon Coupon)  I tipped accordingly.  To be fair,  I hope you give them a try and that you have a pleasant experience.",

    "text": "We gave Gaetano's 2 tries. We thought the first time was a fluke. We were wrong. This time around, the service was below average and the food was nothing special. We could have spent less and had more flavor at Carrabba's. I ordered the lasagna. It was a nice size portion, but the sauce was very watery.  My husband ordered the special, chicken and asparagus risotto. It was extremely bland....we were trying to spice it up by scooping up my watered-down sauce onto it. We would have liked to try some fresh mozzarella or parmersean on it, but our server only checked on us about a minute after we got our food. We never saw him again until it was time for the check.   We really wanted to like this place since it's got a great ambiance and is so close to our house. But we won't be back.",

However the salads that we had were little bit on the small side as portions go. I had filet mignon with the homemade noodles .The homemade noodles were very good but it didn't taste like filet mignon and the meat was overdone and it looked like ground beef. We ordered artichoke hearts they were the worst artichoke hearts I've had in my life. Artichoke hearts and not supposed to have leaves attached to them and ours did. I told the waiter and he quickly blamed it on the new guy in the back. I told him it's not the new guy in the back it's whoever trained him is the problem.",

    "text": "My friend/ex-roomie and I love this spot for our QT dates. We've always had a great experience but this last one was the best by far. We had a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate, so our bill for a bottle of wine, an appetizer and two entrees came to $40 each (including tip). That's a great deal for amazing food and fine dining service.   We got the eggplant app this time, and it was so good. It's like a cheesy crunchy layered veggie lasagna with light tomato sauce. We devoured it. I couldn't decide between the mezzalune or the special italian sausage and shitake mushroom ravioli so the server offered to have the kitchen make me a half order of each. I was amazed by this generous offer!  And when I got my food, I was so happy as each dish was so delicious. I ate my entire plate.  My roomie got the fettucini alfredo and she too finished her entire plate.    This is just one of my fave restaurants when I want to splurge on calories. If you have a Groupon or <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a>, it's a steal for the quality of food and service you get.",

    "text": "I cannot find fault with Gaetano's. Not one. Okay, it ain't cheap (we spent close to $100 for two between two entrees and two cocktails) but it's worth every cent. We've been here a couple of times and although it's far across town, it's worth the drive.  The ambiance is very nice. Clean. Classy. Great date night place. The hostess (I assume Mrs Gaetano) is very friendly. Our server, Gaetano's son, was very knowledgeable about the menu and all 4, count em 4, entree specials. We saw Gaetano make a few rounds. You can tell this family takes great pride in their restaurant and food.   We skipped over apps and indulged in the delicious bread basket. The Italian loaf is soooooo good and obviously made on site. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs (tip: this is not on the menu even though it's hands down the best spaghetti and meatball dish I've ever had. No, really, it's the best. So good, in fact, that I never order spaghetti and meatballs at any other restaurant. Yes, it's that good.). The BF ordered the pork bracciole special which came with pillowy homemade gnocchi. Both our entrees were freaking delicious and the portions were huge. This sets Gaetano's apart from some of the other nicer Italian places in town. They don't skimp on portions. We had plenty leftover for the next day. And the leftovers tasted just as good as the night before. The BF says the bracciole tasted even better the next day.   I highly recommend Gaetano's. Order the spaghetti and meatballs and thank me later!",

    "text": "Went for valentine day but not sure if it was because of the constricted and specially selected menu that we were not able to experience the full bit of Gaetano's offerings.  We were limited to certain items and I gravitated to pasta while the hubs wanted steak. Steak in an Italian place...hm not such a great idea I feel.  Service was very slow, i expected better staffing on this special day.  We sat at a corner with two tables and water finally came after a good 5 minutes.  Took a longer time to get bread and then everything was pretty much acceptable once entree arrived.  Bread was SO delicious....so soft, warm, crunch on the side but not too hard.  Loved it.  The only gripe....the balsamic vinegar. Was it stuck to the bottom of bowl? Olive oil was good but that balsamic adds flavor and I had to dig out the balsamic with my bread, the most work I had to do while dressed up with perfectly manicured nails.  That darn balsamic...all that scraping and that's all I got!  It was worth it though once I got it because that bread was ust divine.  The pasta with mushroom and filet tasted well, very creamy and I was filled just with about three or four fork fulls.  I equated it to Beef Stroganoff with much better flavoring when pepper added.  I would order again, but prepare to box it home. So very rich and creamy.  The steak was dry. We asked for medium and it was cooked medium well...more on the dry side.  I enjoyed the mash and spinach very much...which is quite odd since the steak should have been the highlight.  We had to mix the mash with meat to palate it down.    Let's redeem with creme brulee and we were so disappointed.  The consistency was rough, it was oozing out and we were basically slurping creme brulee vs. having a nice firm dollop on spoon.  We didn't complain since they seemed so busy and we were not sure if we would return....so it's on to another venue to relive how creme brulee should taste like..  I think they took it out too early from fridge (the oozing part) and the preparation of custard was not well executed (hence the grainy texture of the creme). Thank goodness for a nice crackle of sugar on top..that was perfectly fired.",

The sauces with the dishes were not heavy and the pasta was done just right. There are a few items not on the menu so ask for about them. The owners were present and always engaging. Rare in this world of commercial restaurants. Very much a family owned, hands on operation. The ambiance was spot on and the service was impeccable. I am a very critical \"Foodie\" and I find it hard to find fault with Gaetano's.  Finish your meal with the tiramisu; It is not only light but the best I have had. I traveled to Italy for my work and went to Sicily at least twice a month for many years and the authenticity and \"Fussiness\" of quality ingredients mirrors some of the best restaurants in Italy.  The pricing is very, very reasonable for this quality of fine dining. If you want the authentic experience then Gaetano's is possibly the best choice for authentic Italian dining.",

You can see the bartender was rushed and a little upset that he had to train someone new but the new girl was very nice and kind. When I asked him if I get a side order of something for half price with a full entree, he seemed annoyed with me and never even gave me an answer. I finally asked the girl would you please go back and check for me, and he interrupted so rudely and said,\" I said you could.\"Well he never told me that. Then I asked for the menu because I wanted a glass of wine, I had already finished my martini and my Caesar salad. Some new guest came and sat next to me and the bartender said to me ,what this place is a mess you need to clean yourself up. I need to clean my stuff up? You're the bartender you need to clear the plates and the glass and meanwhile I've been waiting for a glass of wine for the last 10 minutes. He was so obnoxious and so rude I asked to get my order to go. I will never ever go to this establishment again. I guess that is why they give out the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupons as an incentive to go there because otherwise the place will be empty. All I wanted was an apology, \" I'm sorry\" from someone, and I didn'tGet it. I will never go back and my friends will never go there either. Instead of enjoying my evening out, I ended up having to take my food to go and cry on the way home because they made me feel so bad. This is one horrible restaurant which I will never ever go back to.",

The hostess quickly sat us down and both her and the waiter was very attentive to our needs.  They gave free complimentary bread which had sourdough, pizza bread and a crispy sesame flatbread with balsamic oil dip. Unlike other Italian restaurants, the bread was very soft and warm. Let's talk about the food. I ordered the salmon stuffed crab w/ orzo pasta special and my partner ordered the rigatoni with meatballs. Both was flavorful but I think the salmon was cooked too well done. The meatballs were kinda hard to pick up with your fork. They should have a separate menu for all the specials only because the it will be easier to look through rather than the waiter having to say every item for the specials.   There were only 2 waiters working on a Friday night and it started to get busy around 7pm so our order took kind of long. Otherwise, the flavors are really great and if there were more servers here your food wouldn't take more than 30 min. Lucky there's a groupon for this place otherwise I would've never hear about this place.",

I checked in on Yelp and received a free bruschetta starter which is amazing! I recommend making a reservation because it can get busy sometimes. The pasta is always made ready to order so everything is so fresh and tastes amazing. The people are so attentive and willing to accommodate any requests you have about the menu. Their bread basket comes to your table warm and crispy which goes well with the olive oil and balsamic vinegar dip. Also you cam always ask for for a bread refill if you need more. I had the ciopinno which is a seafood dish that is to die for! The broth of the  dish pairs well with the fresh bread as well. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!",

The place was almost empty at the time and we were shown to our table.  There is a Yelp check in offer for free bruschetta but you can't double dip on the coupons--either the Yelp or the Groupon--so of course, we went with the Groupon.  We were brought iced teas and a bread basket shortly after being seated and ordering.  The bread basket was a let down.  The one piece of lavash was more like pressed cardboard and the two types of focaccia were merely OK.  We did not get butter but rather a mixture of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  I have to remember in Italian restaurants to tell them to hold the balsamic.  It's just to sweet for me.  Give me plain olive oil and a salt shaker.  We ordered fried artichoke for an appetizer.  It was very good.  The dipping sauce was quite good.  There were 6 pieces of artichoke.  For mains, we each ordered ravioli.  I got the Lobster stuffed ravioli with lobster sauce--a house special for the evening.  My wife got the ravioli stuffed with butternut squash.  We both enjoyed our ravioli.  The serving size was just right.  For dessert, I ordered a cannoli and my wife got the vanilla creme brulee.  Both were good.  The cannoli was fairly standard but I didn't taste any of the pistachio nuts that were supposed to be in the cream.  The creme brulee was the winner of the two desserts.  I think Gaetano's is overpriced.  It only makes sense to go here when you have a coupon of some kind.  Service was good.  It was pointed out when the bill was brought that gratuity had automatically been added because of the Groupon.  I'm not a fan of that.  Actually, the server lost because he got a lesser tip than he would have gotten had I made the decision and not the restaurant.  A good meal but a bit of a drive from Summerlin.  I can get equal or better Italian closer and for a better price.",

To be clear, I love trying new places, I love eating great food, and I love giving fair reviews. What I don't appreciate however, is poor customer service. One of my biggest pet peeves is staff that blatantly ignore you. Now, this may have been the owner or a member of the family, but to stand in front of someone for 5 minutes while they talk on the phone and refuse to acknowledge you while you're trying to patronize the business is a deal-breaker for me. Most relationships business or otherwise  heavily depend on a person's first experience.  In the restaurant business this is typically  with the first person you encounter and regretfully this was my experience. Especially with so many good and great Italian restaurants in the area. Trattoria Italia is four blocks down Eastern and one of my favorites. I will continue to try new restaurants and patronize my regulars, sadly this establishment will not be on that list.",

Gaetano's has a wide variety of wines on their menu and something to go with anything!  The food is served hot and fresh. It is unique and delicious. Their seafood plates are outstanding, as well as the pasta dishes.  The service is five star! And the hospitality is fantastic. We are going there again tonight to celebrate my daughter's birthday. When asked where she wanted to go? She said \"Gaetano's!   Enjoy!",

Every time we go my wife has an internal struggle whether or not to eat the freshmade gnocchi.  My wife spent some time in Italy during college and is an Italian food snob.  I on the other hand do not have an internal struggle, I always get ravioli.  My wife and I love it here.  We go on special occasions or just drop in cause we are hungry and they always have table, but never look empty.  All the servers are great and know their stuff.  Rarely in all the times I have been there, have I not seen the owner walking around the tables, checking on diners and greeting.  This is one of the few restaurants I offer as suggestions to friends, and they have always reported back they loved, and some have become regulars themselves.",

Our bill for two appetizers (tossed salad and pureed gazpacho), grilled salmon, chicken piccata, one iced tea and one $10 glass of Malbec was $91. The food was generally well-prepared except for the gazpacho, which was the special for the night. I like to know what I'm eating, so I prefer my cucumber, etc. not pureed in gazpacho. Service was superb: our water glasses were always kept filled. But that is what you're paying for, not the food. Prices for everything, especially a glass of mediocre wine, are way too high, so this is not a good value compared to other well-known, fine Italian restaurants in Henderson. The atmosphere is too formal for Henderson, lacks a view of anything but other tables (no booths), and is not that warm and inviting. I doubt we will return, even with a coupon. Bottom line: if you have to use a coupon you cannot afford it. Go elsewhere.",

    "text": "I am a local and really should not spread the word about Gaetano's restaurant. It needs to be a secret place for locals so that tourists don't ruin such a good thing. I have been living in Henderson off and on for about 20 years and have eaten at many of the \"so called\" best restaurants in Las Vegas! Most are tourist oriented and the food is usually just mediocre. When I really want the best food (as I did tonight) I always go to Gaetano's on Eastern Blvd in Henderson. Never a disappointment for me! Tonight, Ciappino with a light burrata salad and some cheesecake for dessert. Being seated by the owner who asked what I would like to drink, I asked him to find a cabernet wine that was soft and smooth. He selected a wine for me that was as good as any I have EVER had. And I don't even know him really. Only by sight. My waiter was Nick, -- (a professional) who has been there for quite some time and knows how food should served. Tonight he saw the food served to me and immediately gathered everything up and apologized for the servers who had served the dishes improperly. I did notice but did not complain or even say anything. Nick just rushed over and told them to gather everything and meet him in the kitchen. Returning with the dishes, Nick had everything in order and the food, as always, was fantastic. The choices of the correct burrata chese with the salad and the ripeness and firmness of the tomatoes was superb! The ciappino was fresh and there was NOT ONE grain of grit with the mussels and clams. Unusual in Las Vegas except for Gaetano's! Hoping that tourists don't read this but that lots of locals do! Ask for Nick to be your waiter! jimdiff",

Nothing memorable. And I've been here twice before I decide to write this review. Only reason why we decide to give Gaetano's a second chance was because of that soon to expire Groupon.  With my first visit, I got a pasta dish with just straight up pesto sauce. Gross. So yesterday evening....I got the Rigatoni Alla Bolognese-pasta with homemade meat sauce. It was a safe choice but really just A-OK. Sadly...it tasted like a Lean Cuisine frozen dinner. =/ However, my boyfriend really enjoyed his crusted seabass entree with a side of meat sauce penne. The fish was fresh and that wine sauce was pretty good. This was part of the 5+ specials for the night.  Maybe third times the charm? Until then....three stars it is.  But I will update this review (hopefully bump up instead of bump down) if we ever go back here again. I would like to try the Chicken Piccata. Although...there's another really good Italian restaurant close by. *ahemmontesano*",

But I was slightly turned off by people wearing shorts and a UNLV t-shirt during dinner.   Food: To start, we had the fig wrapped in proscuitto with goat cheese sprinkled on top ($10.99?). The flavors were on the spot - the saltiness of the proscuitto with the sweetness of the fig and the creaminess of the goat cheese. Wow. For the main course, we had the salmon and the Capellini alla Checca ($14.95) to share. It was a very good combination. Salmon was cooked well, but slightly a little too salty for my taste.  I paired my dinner with a glass of the Sangiovese, Santa Cristina (Toscana, Italy) which was $9.50. \"A medium-bodied Italian red with raspberry flavors ,a soft texture and a light fruity finish.\" I was pleasantly surprised by the wine.  I would definitely go back again. Dinner ended up costing about $75 in total, and with the $40 groupon, I only paid $44 with 18% gratuity included.",

His family is very nice and you can't find a better personality than, Danny! The food is amazing! The Seafood/Pasta special (I always forget the name...) is my favorite. The Crab stuffed Salmon, Stuffed Lamb Chop and veal are awesome too. The have a great wine list and also host a monthly wine dinner pairing that is great.

My husband had the rolled pork special.  The flavor was OK.  He gave me a bite of the pork.  You could hardly taste the pork as it was overwhelmed by the amount of bread stuffing inside.  The sauce should have been nappe and it was overly thick.  This was a little disappointing which is why we took away one star.

    "text": "We made a reservation and upon arrival, were seated almost immediately.  Service throughout the meal was prompt, although not particularly personal (for instance, we kept getting the same canned line from our waiter in response to everything).  The place was clean.  Many people in the reviews have commented on the space (ambiance), it was nice, nothing to write home about.  We met the owner, he came over to our table to give us our menus and later, our wine, but he didn't really talk with us.   Our food was above-average, but not the best Italian (certainly not the worst) we've ever had.  Specifically, we had two salads, two entrees, a glass of red wine, two glasses of dessert wine, and one dessert.  The entrees were pretty good, not too filling.  We were shocked at the prices of the alcohol, the mark-up is astronomical.  Overall, for what I listed, our bill was $136, not including tip.    We felt the bill was ridiculously expensive for the amount of food we received. Another reviewer mentioned, and I concur, that the pasta is perfectly arranged to cover the plates but in actuality, is not that much food. Certainly not worth the price!  If we return, it will be for their bar menu, which is offered Monday through Thursday from 5-7 p.m., and we won't be drinking any alcohol.  If you go, not during happy hour, plan on salads ranging from $10-15 and entrees ranging from $19-30.  You will find pasta dishes, with no protein, listed for mid $20's, which is, in my opinion, too expensive.",

Mr Gaetano greeted us as we entered and asked if we would like a table or sit at the bar, we sat at the bar and was greeted by Alex (a new barman) who was very friendly and knowledgeable of the drinks and menu. We had a scampi appetizer which was cooked perfectly in a lemon and pepper sauce, it was fantastic, at no point did we feel rushed to order something else we just sat and chatted at the bar while Alex stopped by only to refill our glasses. Our main course arrived, my wife had the cheese filled ravioli and the pasta was wafer thin and tasted great.  I had the Penne with Bolognese which was fantastic, the pasta was cooked perfectly and the Bolognase gravy was to die for. All in all a great experience, we had been before but kinda forgot about it, now we have been again it will be one of our regular spots to have a nice early dinner.",

We had our two kids and she gave them each a twisty toy but when we asked if they had kids menu she said \"no this is a fine dining restaurant,\" in a smug way. It's not fine dining if you have to tell people it's fine dining. We actually dine out at fine restaurants often and they cater to children just fine. She was condescending in implying that a fine dining restaurant wouldn't offer a kids menu. I hardly ever write reviews but i thought she was rude and it would have been fine if she had just said they didnt have a kids menu but to imply that such a nice restaurant would never offer such a thing was just plain rude, especially when she doesn't know what she's talking about. The waiter took a long time to come take our order. I finished my plate and they didn't pre-bus the table and take my plate away. We will not return.",

We came here on a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon for 25.00 and we heard so many good reviews about this place. We pretty much knew what we wanted to order based on other yelpers reviews. To start we ordered the Carpaccio which was topped with arugula and Parmesan cheese, drizzled with olive oil. The beef was cut paper thin and the peppery taste of the arugula along with the salty Parmesan was a perfect combination. The one thing that stood out for my was the olive oil which was very fragrant and can tell it was high quality. For our entrees we ordered the Ossobuco and the Ravioli stuffed with butternut squash. The Ossobuco was stewed in a red sauce which had deep flavors served over a saffron risotto. It was fork tender but the highlight of the dish was the bone marrow, it added so much richness to the dish. The Ravioli stuffed with butternut squash was my favorite. The pasta was cooked brilliantly because the filling to pasta ratio was perfect. I was served with a brown butter sauce with sage. Just the smell of the sage made this dish stand out.   Overall this place was really good. It was pretty crowded on an early Friday evening so reservations are recommended. I would definitely come back and try their other pasta dishes and deserts.",

    "text": "So normally when I come to Las Vegas, I dine like most other vacationers in town for the weekend. Brunch buffets, food courts lunches and an occasional overpriced dinner in one of the casinos on the Strip. Sometimes I make it to the Main Street Station 777 Steakhouse Grill downtown which I think is one of the best bargains in Vegas.  So when I friend told me that he had a place in mind for dinner on the outskirts of town in Henderson, I was more than happy to oblige. He had raved about Gaetano's before and I was eagerly awaiting to see what all the fuss was about, and also spend an evening away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip.  The great thing about this place is it's a family owned establishment with more locals than tourists eating there. It feels like a place that you would actually go out to for a nice dinner if you lived in the area! The owners are extremely friendly and chatted with us before bringing out our appetizer, a plate of assorted cheeses, bruschetta, olives, assorted bread basket and a delicious centerpiece of fresh mozerella drizzled with balsamic vinegar atop a bed of fresh arugula. The cheese will literally melt in your mouth, leaving you to crave another three or four pieces. But fear not, then there are the entrees...  Our waiter Nick was extremely friendly and knowledgable, and explained the specials to us in extreme detail, and they all sounded delicious. We could tell that he is very passionate about the food at Gaetano's. My friend ordered the chicken-asparagus risotto (off the regular menu), which he said was delicious. I also ordered off the main menu, mostly because of the rave reviews that the Ossu Bucco has gotten at this place. When it came, my eyes practically popped out of my head. What you had was an enormous shank of meat complete with the bone marrow sitting atop a bed of saffron risotto. I went straight for the marrow, spreading it onto the bread. That first bite may be one of my top 5 of all time. The shank was tender and delicious, smothered in what looked to be a tomato and red wine reduction sauce. It all went perfectly with the rich and delicious saffron risotto (who even thinks of such a thing?!?!). Needless to say by the end of the meal every last bit of marrow had been sucked from the bone, and by the last sip of my glass of house red wine I was practically in heaven. Oh yeah, and then there was the creme brulee with fresh strawberries that was one of the best I've ever had. So in order to sum everything up...  If you are ever in Vegas, GO TO GAETANO'S YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!   #Mange",

    "text": "well, well ,well...where do I begin? As soon as you walk in the door you are greeted by an old lady who gives off an air of judgement and indifference. She acts more like a gatekeeper than an ambassador! She really set the tone for the evening and unfortunately it wasn't good. It was also my birthday and I really felt slighted by her and the staff in general. The restaurant is beautiful. It is a shame that at 7pm in the evening the place was empty. I would assume it has a lot to do with the fact that they are very expensive and the portions are so disappointing. I mean wow...unless you buy a Groupon discount and really pace yourself, you can't help but feel ripped off!  WE HAD TO BEG FOR A BASKET OF BREAD! That's right...after sitting for over 30 minutes we were still not provided any and we had to get up to find the busboy to get us some. The staff is not terrible but are slow and I guess take their lead from the old lady who insists that everyone be miserable.  The food is blah, Rigatoni Bolognese was so hot temperature-wise you couldn't taste it. The Gnochetti Sardi was half a plate of blandness but the little sausage you got was good. The Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken was so disappointing. The Cioppino fish stew over pasta for almost $50 was more like hospital food...so bland and the seafood ingredients were just not there.  All in all....I suggest you go elsewhere for Italian. We are regulars at Don Vito's in the South Point, we also go to Casa Di Amore where the bill never is less than $275 but the staff is awesome and the food is filling.  To close...I never go to a restaurant and not get at least one bottle wine but this place will force you to alter your dining habits. I'll pay more for good service and a sense of value for the experience but I still had a $250 check at Gaetano's and we cut back due to the overall negative time and experience. But hey...you be the judge!",

We came to the place Friday to look at the menu because we have lived in Henderson now for 11years and have wanted to try the place since we moved here. The hostess was rude and has no customer service at all. We took the to go menu and decided to eat at jalisco's. Tonight (Saturday) we decided to buy the groupon and proceeded to our reservation at 7:30. We arrive and this time no one is at the hostesses stand. The first person we see is the manager. No greeting from this guy period. He just sticks his finger up like one minute. Then comes the same rude hostess. She says how many? She then says two? I say yes. She says are you Bobby? I say yes. She says you no you have two reservations?  I say no. She says yes you did and I just deleted one. I'm thinking OK great. A hello, welcome, heck anything is better than telling me what she thinks I Might have done wrong. We get to the table and the waiter approaches us and ask's would you like something to drink. I say coke, he says we only have Pepsi. I said what else do you have. He ignores me and takes my wife's order. Then he looks at me and stares, I don't say a word. After about 25 seconds he says and for you? I again repeat what else do you have? He starts to name things,and I stop him and say I would like the tea. He leaves, comes back and says what would you like to eat. My wife ask if he has any specials? He rattles them off. He was actually good at this. My wife orders chicken parmesan, and I ask about the lasagna. I say how is it made. He stumbles over some words that I don't understand. Then he looks at me with a deer in the head lights look and says what do you mean how is it made almost in a challenging way. I say well is it vegetable lasagna and before I can finish he says it's meat sauce. I say OK but how is the lasagna actually made he cuts me off and says it's meat. I say OK. I'll take the lasagna. They bring my wife's food and it looks OK. Then they bring mine and I don't say a word. This its suppose to be fine dining? They bring me a boat. (A boat is a ceramic dish that is oblong not very big at all, and not deep at all.) I take a bite of this and there is no sauce at all. I was expecting a regular plate like everyone else. The taste was terrible. It taste like something I eat at someone else's house whose wife don't cook so well. The funny thing is he cuts me off and says its meat sauce. I had the guy that brings you the drinks get me some sauce. The sauce was actually good and it made the food stomachable. The manager visited this one table in front of us and hung out there almost half the time we were there. He never visited our table once. This place is terrible with customer service and food. I recommend you eat at someone Else's house that cant cook before you pay for dog food that not even the dog will eat. Disappointed I was celebrating a special evening with my wife. Boy was I disappointed.",

    "text": "We were given a Groupon by a friend to check out Gaetano's. We never go to Henderson so it was nice to make a trip out that way. I love Italian food, obviously, so I was excited to try a new place. It was a pretty slow Sunday night and we were seated fairly quickly. Nice traditional italian menu and I would call it an \"upscale casual\" restaurant. I was impressed with the \"Specials\" they offered, however there were several options and they were all so detailed that by the time the server finished explaining them all I couldn't remember what most of them were. Would be nice to have them printed up somewhere on the table. On to the food: We ordered the burrata cheese salad which was one of the appetizer specials. It was a delicious little salad. Emphasis on \"little\". For the price it definitely was a bit small. We love burrata cheese so were excited to have some as it is difficult to find. There was one small piece on the salad and since we split it, it wasn't much. I believe it was around $11-12 dollars too which for an appetizer salad is pricey. Good, but pricey! I ordered linguini with red clam sauce as my entree, my absolute favorite dish to order at any Italian restaurant. It was very tasty and made just right. Quick note for one of the servers assistants... when a guest asks for parmesean cheese, they don't need you to tell them \"oh, I wouldn't put it on that\" .... just get me the cheese. Thanks :) All in all, good experience, nice servers and well maintained restaurant. Doubt I'll be back but that's only because it's pretty far from me and I can get good Italian close to home.",

Our order was taken at 7:42, but the salad did not arrive until 8:10.  Keep in mind that we had told the waiter we only had an hour.  About 5 minutes later, the entrees arrived, and we had to send one back because it contained onions which we specifically asked to exclude when ordering.  The food was actually quite delicious.  Their signature salad included warm shitake mushrooms and the chicken marsala was flavorful without being greasy or dried out.  Too bad we didn't have time to finish our meal.  We had to flag down people for drink refills and the check.  Later we found out they were short handed, but that didn't help our situation.",

    "text": "We ate our first meal there recently (four of us).  Everyone truly enjoyed the food.  If you're not too price sensitive, I would highly recommend this restaurant.  Even if you are price sensitive, I still recommend it, at least for special occasions.  Four pasta dishes, one salad, and a $30-something bottle of wine, tax and tip worked out to an average of ~$40 per person.  That's more than we normally want to spend on a meal, even a relatively good one, but the more I think about it the more I come to the conclusion that the quality of the whole experience was worth the price.  Even though we probably won't eat there often, I am sure we will eat there again.    Although our server didn't smile much his service was very professional, knowledgeable, efficient, and attentive.  The restaurant seemed to be on target with their reservations.  Everyone who came in seemed to be seated promptly although the restaurant remained pretty full.  The tables are well spaced and spacious.  Everything was clean.  Although it was busy, there were no significant distractions during our meal.  Although TVs showing sports could be seen in the bar, they are separated from the dining room by glass and therefore were not audibly disruptive to diners.  Gaetano's seems like it would be a good place to take a date.    I thought about details of Gaetano's compared with other Italian restaurants in the immediate neighborhood.  [Each of the other restaurants has negatives, including things like uncomfortable tables/chairs, sports on TV that can be seen and heard in the dining area, having to wait too long to be seated, tables being too close together, too much noise, etc., whereas Gaetano's had none of those problems.]  Gaetano's seems to have put a lot of effort into the whole experience, not just the food.  Note:  For many people this probably would have been a 5-star review.  I give 4 stars (would be 4-1/2 if given that option) only because of my personal preference not to spend quite so much money.",

    "text": "I dont care if your Italian, American, Mexican, etc  or rich, poor or middle class  if you own a restaurant you should be humble and gracious!  We went in around 9:30 NYE after working all day.  I'm assuming the large older man with a thick Italian accent at the front desk was MR Gaetano?  He wasnt any of the things I would expect from an owner.  That was the start of our experience.  The menu was set since it was NYE as many places do, so that wasnt an isssue.  We waited quite awhile to even be greeted by our server and by this time it was close to 10 so they weren't THAT busy.  We ordered wine, 2 meals, and Calamari for an App and cheescake for dessert.  Not one thing was impressive.  I was expecting to be wowed.  The bill was $139 before tip.  I hate to sound so negative but thats the experience I had.  Sad too because we like to eat at non chain restaurants.  Hopefully it was just a long day since it was New Years Eve and everyone was tired and ready to go home.",

    "text": "This little gem in Henderson made me (yes, me!) like mushroom ravioli!  Our waiter was amazing and sold me on the homemade ravioli with sausage, mushroom and asparagus and I loved it!  We started off with the wonderful stuffed dates appetizer and arugula salad.  I had a bite of my friend's pasta with vodka sauce which was also amazing!  We ended the night with their tiramisu, and I wish I had saved room.  What a wonderful place- great service and amazing food!  Check it out!",

    "text": "Very disappointing.  Our waiter, a very nice guy, failed to tell us all of the specials for the night.   After ordering, we overhead the waiter at the next table advising of the specials which included 3 dishes that we were not advised of.   Both my wife and I would have ordered one of the specials not mentioned if we had heard about them.  When our food was delivered, my wife's order was incorrect.   Once it was brought out correctly, the owner says to her you didn't ask for gluten free pasta.   Her response was Yes, I did, it was clearly stated to the waiter.  The waiter even went into to confirm with the chef and then repeated the order back to her correctly.   I then told the owner about not hearing about 3 of the specials and he storms back into the kitchen to yell at someone.   However, he never came back to apologize to us, offer to fix our meal or offer an alternative meal.  Obviously, there is a management problem with this place.   The food was just OK, nothing special.   We will not be going back, nor will we recommend this place to any of our friends.   Its unfortunate when a place has an opportunity to impress you with the service recovery and a few simple words but they don't know how.",
