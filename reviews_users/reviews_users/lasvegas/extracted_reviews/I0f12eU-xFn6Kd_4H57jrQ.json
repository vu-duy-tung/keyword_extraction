I understand a wait time of 30 minutes for pickup and 45 min to an hour for delivery. This is pretty accurate from experience. I only have 2 complaints about this place; the pizza sauce is absolutely too salty! It needs to have more of a sweet kick in my opinion, a good balance between the salt n sugar is needed. Second, I think they are over priced all around.",

    "text": "So my boyfriend and I had late night stomach pangs and we decided, via the Eat24 app on my phone, that Napoli Pizza would be the one!  As some people may not be aware of, Napoli Pizza does do delivery. They charge you a fee of $2.50 but that's easy money and we were starving.  I wish I had read about this place before I blindly gave them a chance! First of all Yelpers, why is it necessary to make a massively, overwhelmingly large menu?  Their menu is huge.  HUGE.   They have:  20-something appetizers, at least 10-12 types of salads, 7 variations of soups, wings, boneless wings, 5 types of chicken dinners, ribs and rib platters (with sides), 20-something hot sandwiches, at least 7-8 cold sandwiches, 3-5 wraps, 1/2 and 1 pound burger platters (there are still like 7-9 types of different burgers!), a substantial handful of pasta and spaghetti entrees, BAKED pasta and spaghetti entrees, triple-decker sandwiches, veal dinners, lots of pizza types, a pretty solid children's menu and about 5-7 different dessert options.  I have never been so taken back by a menu.  Maybe this is new to me and not new to others, but this had me worried because I've worked in restaurants and seen too many Restaurant Impossible episodes!  There is NO WAY you'll be pumping out excellent food when you're having to make a dictionary sized amount at all times, 24/7. And you know what Yelpers?  There food really did come out some kinda' nasty.  ~What we ordered: a ceasar salad, one of the appetizer combo platters, 12 piece medium wings, their garlic balls and one Philly steak sandwich.  To be fully honest, if I hadn't ordered the wings, I would have been giving them one star.  One star for 'they tried, but failed'.  My fears came True with ordering so late at night because the majority of all the food we received wasn't even warm anymore!  They actually took well over an hour and fifteen minutes and on my map, they are only 3 miles away from me.  Terrible!  The ceasar salad was NOT and will not ever be worth $8.  All they did really was put romaine lettuce in a to-go container, sprinkle stale (yes, it felt and tasted STALE) parmesan cheese all over the lettuce and sprinkle tiny bits of disgustingly old tasting croutons on top.  I mean, seriously, I could go out to Walmart and buy all of these ingredients myself but probably have it 1) come out tasting way better and 2) well, it sure as hell wouldn't be a friggin' $8 salad!  The boyfriend's Philly steak sandwich wasn't very good at all.  I've actually never eaten one before, so as the loving and curious individual (and partner) that I am, I took a bite.  I regretted it.  The bread felt hard and it actually tasted like it came out of a bag (again, Walmart anyone?).  The cheese wasn't fully melted, the meat was barely warm.  It was a mess.   The garlic balls were by far the worst in my opinion!  They were pretty much inedible to me because they had put way too much parsley on it!  Literally, each garlic ball was green.  GREEN.  The red... \"sauce\", that came with them was overly spiced as well.  There was a huge bay leaf I just about ate that was sticking out of the tiny plastic container the sauce was in - I wigged out.  That really grossed me out considering whenever I cook, I pull those out well before I serve my food!  It's meant to add flavor, never be carelessly left in the food.  Gross.  Their sampler platter.  I was -so- disappointed.  I have a huge soft-spot in my heart for fried food (I come from the South!).  The onion rings and zucchini sticks were tasty but the fried mushrooms and jalapeno poppers were absolutely gross!  The friend mushrooms had a very sweet taste to them.  I took a bite of one and just about spit it out.  I've never had a friend mushroom before that tasted sugary.  Lo and behold, my boyfriend grabbed one and he had the same reaction.  The jalapeno poppers... ugh, the poppers.  Jalapeno poppers are a weakness of mine and these were totally botched.  The cheese was strange and had a grainy texture to it - the jalapeno tasted old and slimy.  Overall, this platter wasn't bad; go for a specific appetizer by them that other people like, don't waste your money.  I feel it was a waste of -my- money to get a sampler when half of it I actually didn't eat because it was horridly made.    The medium-hot wings I chose to order are Napoli's saving grace, at least in my opinion.  The sauce was delicious, though I wish they had put more of a \"fry\" on the wings before drenching it all over them.  The meat was juicy, so I can't complain.  I really wouldn't say their wings blew me away, as I've had better.  Semi-satisfying wings really don't compensate for a poor job done, however!  All in all, I feel slightly jipped for my money and I won't be purchasing food from them again.  If you choose to, just beware and hope for the best.  It seems one person gets a fairly good experience while the other, in this case me, gets the bad end of the stick and you're stuck with sub-par food",

    "text": "Alright, here's the deal: Napoli does late night pizza delivery with a pretty huge delivery area. I just moved across town and they delivered to both addresses. I'm also a night owl, and they're open so late it seems like they're open 24 hours. If you're in Henderson, and you're hungry at a ridiculous hour, Napoli probably has you covered.  They actually have a full Italian menu, but I've only ever ordered the pizza. My favorite? Canadian bacon, pineapple, white onion, mushroom. Ya, not a lot of folks can dig that when they hear it, but I assure you it's the ultimate pizza.  So how is their pizza? It's good. Much better than the big chains. Nothing fancy, but solid and satisfying. I'm half Italian and I grew up near Boston, so if you don't agree with my pizza taste, that's on you.  They're not super friendly on the phone but they're effective. After the first order they've always pulled up my info in a heartbeat. They always get the order right, and they've always been able to find my place, even behind gates and in the dark.  It's solid late night pizza. Delivered nearly anywhere in Henderson. What's not to like?",

    "text": "I really want to like this place but there is a lot of room for improvement. I've lived in Henderson and worked in restaurants for 20 years & started out in family owned pizza places in Henderson. So I know that there's no acceptable reason for it to take 25 minutes to make one sandwich, or 40 minutes to make one pizza. I've ordered delivery from here a small handful of times over the course of many years when they were close to GVHS. I recall the food taking a really long time to arrive, the food was disappointing and we ordered a huge pizza and the middle of the pizza was raw and soggy.  I recently decided I would try again, thought it would be better since I'd heard good things from other people and it had been so many years. I ordered a sandwich for pick up and was quoted 25 minutes. It was dead as a doornail when I got there & I did not see a justifiable reason for a sandwich to take 25 minutes.  Maybe there was a lot of deliveries but doubtful, it it was a weekday and it wasn't lunch or dinner time. There was two tables in a restaurant that had already been served their food.. The gentleman behind the counter was extremely friendly and made me feel as though I was in an authentic Italian restaurant which I liked. The restaurant inside and the patio is beautiful! Really nice! The pizza being served in the dining room looked really good. I'd like to come back and dine in with my family or maybe get a pizza sometime soon. When I got home and opened the box I thought I got the wrong order because it looked like some kind of beef sandwich, I ordered a chicken parm. It looked dark because the sauce was brown and didn't resemble a tomato based sauce. It was thick like a paste, sweet and burnt and bitter tasting as if it had been over reduced or possibly cooked repeatedly and or refrigerated repeatedly.  Despite this I still gave them another try and ordered pizza for pick up and I'm told it'll take 40 minutes. I said no thank you. Some places have a reputation for taking a long time but usually those places busy and worth the wait bc they are consistent. If we were to dine in, would it take 40 minutes for the order to reach the table? That would be unacceptable. We will see because I would really like to try the pizza so I probably will but I will give myself plenty of time.",

Service: I would have given them 4 stars if it weren't for the bad service. It took over an hour for them to finish my take-out order (1 pizza and a side of garlic balls). Also, the lady at the counter was not very friendly. In fact, one of the other patrons called her a certain 4-letter word that rhymes with \"hitch.\"  Ambience: It was nice.

Friday the hubby and I decided we wanted to try something new and had seen their commercial on TV and so begin our downward journey. Called in to the place an order and the girl who took the order rushed us through and even snapped when I tried to repeat my order. I should've taken that as a warning to cancel my order but we continued. Our order: Pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni  Calamari Mozzarella sticks  Garlic bread with cheese  Uhmmm first of all, I've never seen calamari look like a fish stick. It was tasteless with a rubbery consistency. I ate one piece and ended up throwing the rest away.  Mozzarella sticks...you could tell they were just frozen and not fresh as the chess didn't even melt when we bit into it. Another waste.  The garlic bread! The only reason why I'm giving this place a star and a review. The garlic bread was actually good and a good price. The pizza... =\\ so greasy and tasteless...and it had no sauce. wtf? It was dry, but oily on the surface. Complete failure all around. Nothing had any flavor to it.  This was an overall disappointing meal. I will not be going back for a second chance. No use in wasting money there...",

    "text": "I am a fan of pizza. However, I am a bigger fan of eggplant parmesan. When I visit a pizzeria, and an eggplant parmesan hero or eggplant parmesan special is on the menu, forget about the pizza. This has always been the case with Metro Pizza.     A few Sundays ago, after living in Henderson for like ten years, I finally caught Napoli's act. It just so happened that I was up to something different for lunch when quite a few restaurants were closed on Sunday. I thought this is Las Vegas, a City that never sleeps. Anyways, recently I wanted to try Napoli's despite some negative reviews by reputable Yelper's. I was in an adventurous mood. What's the worst that could of happened?      The negative reviews wouldn't pertain to my experience. The majority of those reviews pertain to the pizza and wait time. As soon as I looked at the menu and read eggplant parmesan hero, I was ecstatic. I have been looking for restaurants nearby that make the eggplant parmesan hero, a sandwich that I have fond memories of in New York. I had my choice of over 100 Coke beverages to compliment the eggplant parmesan. Napoli's has the Coke Freestyle machine. I love these machines because they feature my favorite soft drink in the World: strawberry soda. How can I not appreciate a marriage of my favorite soft drink and one of my dearest foods? I paid at the counter, consequently the woman I paid the money to would serve the food and drink on the red and white patterned tablecloth. The eggplant parmesan on toasted bread was out of this World delicious. The French fries weren't bad either. The wait between order and the food was around 15 minutes. I'd wait a far longer amount of time for this.     What is better than an eggplant parmesan hero is eggplant parmesan with spaghetti and garlic bread. What is best is when it only costs $8.99 with a Coke beverage in a large glass. Napoli's is far more than pizza. Up til 3 p.m., on weekdays the lunch specials menu are fantastic. There are so many choices. I have been decided on the eggplant parmesan with spaghetti. The three times that I have delighted in this dish, I have left satisfied and wanting to return. The eggplant parmesan with the mouth watering mozzarella cheese is hot. It's served with the eggplant parmesan on the top of spaghetti. The portion is generous. The wait times ranged between 20 to 25 minutes on the last three visits. While I waited, I enjoyed the uptempo music and Fanta strawberry soda. Most of all I really enjoyed eating the eggplant parmesan with spaghetti and drinking the Strawberry Fanta.     Owing to the fact that I am a lover of eggplant parmesan and can never ever get enough of it, I am a fan of Napoli's. The fact that right now I'm getting hungry thinking about their eggplant parmesan means I  will be returning.",

    "text": "Our last order from Napoli really changed our views on the restaurant. Previously we'd have pretty decent service and the food was always excellent; we always were aware that they were going to be about 15 minutes later then they said for delivery.  We ordered off of their website yesterday and were really disappointed in the delivery service. We placed our order online and got a confirmation email at 6:18pm. We figured okay, it'll probably be an hour until we get our food due to past history. 7:18 rolled around, still nothing. We decided to wait a little longer, finally calling at 7:38pm. They told us they couldn't find our order and put us on hold for ten minutes. When they took us off hole, they ask for our confirmation number, phone number, and address. Then they finally said they found it and it would be about 45 minutes until they could deliver out food.   However, they did give us a discount to apologize, so I will say that was nice of them to do. Our food got to our house around 8:40pm, so we were pretty hungry at that point. Their food is always really good which makes me sad about the whole delivery thing. The white pizza is excellent, their boneless wings as really nice (there isn't all breaking and no chicken), and we tried their garlic balls (which is just dough with garlic and herbs and marinara to dip in) which were decent. But the price of them was worth it for sure.  I'd highly recommend their pizzas for sure, but maybe just pick it up yourself.",

The food is great and we have tolerated wrong orders (many times), loss of orders, late delivery, and tonight...by mistake... the driver was given substantially more $ than the order cost.  We contacted the store only of course for the delivery guy to deny our claim, then for the manager to proceed to say he wasnt going to take sides???   If anything I expected them to be honest or in the very least look into it.  Very disappointed.  My mistake not double checking the $ and worse...for thinking the guy would be honest.  One of my major pet peeves is dishonesty and I won't be ordering from them again.",

I showed up after about 35 minutes with no one in line but the 4 folks at the counter must not have been able to see my red shirt and 220 pound frame cuz it took a minute or two before they allowed me to pay. 25 minutes later the food came out; one of two pizzas wrong and the fries for my wings were thrown out as soon as I got home- cold, rubber, inedible by anyone's standards.  After alerting them to the mistakes with no apologies, the correct pizza(pepperoni) came out and was BADLY cut in no uniform manner.  Again, no apologies and when I tried to talk to the guy behind the counter, he walked of mumbling in what I believe was an Eastern European accent.  I've gone to these guys for a few years, but sad to say I've had enough of the rudeness.  We are not going back again.",

Because I ordered a cup of soup, mozzarella sticks, and cheese bread sticks for delivery and as I'm typing this it has been an hour and 17 minutes. It CANNOT take longer than 5 minutes to put mozz sticks in a deep fryer and some soup in a bowl. I don't care if this is the best junk food I've ever had, not worth an hour and a half.  *Edited after food arrived exactly an hour and 36 minutes after order*   Mozzarella sticks were cooled, the cheese in the middle was solidified. Cheese bread sticks are soooo good. The marinara served with it has a hint of spice. SUPER YUM. The soup was scalding hot. Driver was friendly actually. My guess is they made each item 20 minutes apart mozz sticks first, soup last (lol jk). All in all not memorable enough to pay another $25 for, even if I switch to pick up.",

OH and don't FORGET THERES ALSO A  a 1$ processing fee?? A built in delivery fee $2.50 and average flavor and pitiful value.   Do yourself a big favor and patronize any other mom and pops restaurant that gives you value for your money.  There's a reason why CHAIN restaurants do so well in United States and it's because they give you value for your money mom-and-pop stores in a lot of cases don't deliver and Napoli pizza is one of them.      I hope you heed my advice,  SKIP Napoli Pizza it's nothing spectacular compared to a lot of the other local mom-and-pop restaurants that sell pizza in Las Vegas. It's absolutely a rip off for what you get for your money I'm sure that they use very cheap mozzarella cheese on their pizzas because their pizzas are no better value and pizzas are one of the most profitable items in the food industry.    Just sharing my opinion hope it helps",

Really Bad taking first spot though. 90 percent of the time the food is gross. The pizza is what I'm basing this on. The crust is sometimes great and sometimes like cardboard. I always ask for light cheese and it varies every time I get it. From the perfect amount to literally NO cheese on it at all. Last time I got it the person didn't put any cheese. So when I called back the person on the phone was really rude and said well we put light cheese and gave no option to get another pizza. I even said I'll bring it back. Clearly I can just see tomato sauce and toppings there is no cheese. The customer service is really bad. They are as rude as can be. Like they are doing you a favor for you eating or ordering from there. your a burden.

The balsamic vinaigrette is amazing, the entire salad is fresh & flavorful. The service is always great whether we dine in or have it delivered. Check this place out, it is worth it!!!",

    "text": "Monday night I ordered a pizza, it took so long to get to me that I fell asleep. Now this is totally on me, no blame on the restaurant on that but when I called to see if there was anyway to get a refund or maybe a replacement (I had to try, I didn't want to be out $20) the manager was so incredibly rude and basically accused me of being a liar. He said he could tell from the time the order was dispatched that it arrived in an appropriate time of 30 mins. I told him that I ordered the pizza at 1:51am (which he confirmed) and the first call from the driver was at 3:00am. He told me that is not possible because the store is closed at 3. I said but it is possible and it happened- I have the records ON MY PHONE! He continued to tell me I was wrong and finally said he would offer me a measly 10% on a future order. I told him no, that was ridiculous and he should keep in mind that this was my first and will be my last experience with their company. He then said he would speak to the night manager at 5pm to see what happened and call me back. Do you think I got a callback? Of course not. Again my beef is with the rude manager not the fact that I fell asleep. That is totally on me. This situation could have been handled so much better. Harry if you read this- here is a script for next time: \"I am so sorry that happened to you. Unfortunately we cannot offer a refund or a replacement but I can give you 10% off if you would like to place a new order.\"",

    "text": "I've eaten here a few times and the food is always good and the prices aren't bad. That's the only reason I'm giving them two stars today.  I ordered lunch from them a couple of weeks ago, and they said it would be ready at a certain time. Right around then, the guy calls to tell me he's arrived with my food. After a minute or so of waiting for him to knock on the door, I open it and see nobody outside. So I called back and told the guy I didn't see him, and he starts to get a little bit upset with me. He asked for my address again, and I gave it to him.  So about an hour later, I call again and ask if everything was okay with the order and delivery. The guy then begins to yell at me, saying that he's called multiple times and I never answer my phone, at which point the phone is, I assume, snatched from his hands. Another guy, who is hardly more friendly asks for my address and confirms my order. He assures me that someone will be there in less than an hour with my food. At this point, I probably should have cancelled my order and asked for a refund.   So, as promised, about 40 minutes later (over four hours since I placed the order) a nice older man arrives with my food. He was very apologetic and sweet, their only saving grace that day. I finally crack open my meal, and the food is horrific. The wings were under-sauced and tasted old, and the fries weren't even edible. All that trouble, and I ended up with nothing more than an apology and gross food. I will not be eating here again, EVER.",

    "text": "I've passed by Napoli more times than I can count on my way to the Great Greek in the same strip of shops. After almost three years of passing by we decided to stop in and give them a try.  Friday night I tried to call in an order for a pick up to take with me over to Bad Beat Brewery. The wait on a pick up was 35-40 minutes and the woman on the phone was less than pleasant. So I scratched that and grabbed Freddy's instead.  Saturday rolls around and my husband decides he still wants to try Napoli. We arrived around 6:30 on Saturday night and so did everybody else in the neighborhood. They were very busy. My husband was instantly taken back by the chaos and said he wanted to be their business consultant to help with improving their process, haha. In case they care....they need a spot for take out orders (not on top of the dessert case where they were constantly knocking things over trying to find space) and dirty dishes and plates should go to the wash area (not on the dessert case next to food).  We stepped up to the counter, ordered, and then grabbed a table to wait for our food. My salad came out after about 10 minutes, breadsticks after 30, and then our pizza about 10 minutes after that. The guy dropping our food was apologetic for the wait, but I can definitely see why others have complained about the wait times.  The House Salad with Italian was boring, but fresh. The dressing seemed like it was made with cheap oil so I'd get a different dressing if I ordered again. The breadsticks were really good and came with enough for several people to share. They tasted homemade and the bread itself had great flavor. I would enjoy these even without all of the butter on top. Our Mexican pizza (pepperoni, beef, chorizo, cilantro, onions, and jalapenos) was really good. I liked the crispy crust and indulgent greasy nature of the pizza.  This is a good local spot to grab a decent pizza.",

    "text": "In the heart of this place, is great food. Like many other restaurants of this caliber, there is so much to take in before even glancing at their sometimes overwhelming menu.  I cannot speak for their delivery service since I've always picked up from their locations, but the price is reasonable for the 16\" pepperoni pizza I got, along with the Garlic balls with cheese and side of ranch.  The estimated wait time was spot on, giving us plenty of time to take care of our necessities before heading to the place and picking up our order.  The one thing Napoli does not lack is the taste. For a little bit more than your factory-line pizza chain, you're getting quality pies, and rightfully so.  4 stars for my latest pizza experience.",

I've been to Napoli's twice and last night was not to my surprise another horrible customer service experience. I was in the store for 5 minutes before being greeted, after the employees managers or whatever the hell these guys were finished up their conversation they rudely asked what is it. I said I'm here for take out sir. He said okay are you Jae I replied yes, and he told me to sign here. When I signed the paper he said why no tip? When I'm the fuck does someone thing they deserve a tip for simply cooking my food?  when he gave me the pizza he placed it on the counter and yelled from the back kitchen and said \" sir your food is on the counter \" bye. So I left without napkins, peppers, parmesan cheese nothing. The thing that made me so bothered by this is that I payed 30 dollars for 1 pizza! Where the fuck is the customer service is HENDERSON! There is none when you go to a food establishment.",

I told her I wasn't willing to hold that long she said \"we are too busy to help\". Then another employee took my call and said \"we can't help you\". I will never consider this restaurant again.

Too many other places to choose from and tell my family and friends about than to receive decent food with horrible customer service. I would expect more from the service industry Mecca of the world.

The woman on the phone was extremely rude to me and then just handed the phone off to a man who was even worse he even hung up on me when I asked if I could just place another order and pick it up. After that whenever I placed an order my food was always over cooked or just plain gross so I just stopped ordering and going to them all together. A little tip for anyone who wants to eat here go somewhere else because as you can read in other reviews the woman who works the counter is extremely rude and the other staff will treat you just as cold hearted if not worse.",

You guess it, she told my wife to wait again, my wife waited a good 20 minutes. Wow I really think this place is disorganized on service. I hope this goes to the owner. Please.

We usually get the whole thing with pepperoni and then half pineapple and half sausage. They only charge for 1 additional topping which is cool. Some places will nickel and dime for each additional topping, even though it's only on half the pizza. What I like about this place is they have a dining room, so I get the pickup price, but get to eat it there. Add a basket of fries and some wings, and you have a meal under $25 with plenty of leftovers to take home. They have a lot of other items as well, but the pickup special is too good of a deal to pass up, so I end up getting it every time. And a bonus, they have the freestyle coke machine. Oh and it's family owned and operated! Love that.",

It's very rare they look up from their cell phones to help a customer. When you finally do get their attention they pull an attitude if you ask for something.

    "text": "Ordered from here a few times and it's really very good.  The Newton sandwich is delicious, my girlfriend orders it almost every time. VERY big sandwich. Chicken is breaded but not mushy.  The Ziti Siciliano is pretty good. The menu doesn't say if it comes with marinera in it, only that it's eggplant, mushrooms, ricotta and penne all baked. It does come with some marinera sauce but upon initially ordering it I requested a side of marinera just in case and it was a good decision to do so. Huge portion, definitely enough for two people so I had more than enough leftover. Eggplant was soft but not falling apart and there was quite a bit of ricotta but it wasn't overwhelming. Really very good.   I've ordered their New York Style pizza and it was delicious. Ordered it with their alfredo sauce instead of pizza sauce and it was good but definitely lacked garlic. Most alfredo sauce is overloaded with garlic so it was a little disappointing that there wasn't much of it, but I'd rather have less garlic than so much that it's inedible. Next time we'll make sure to have garlic be one of the toppings.  The California Shrimp salad is exactly what it says it is. No complaints on that one but FYI vinagerette isn't the best choice of dressing. 1000 Island would be a better option so the avocado doesn't disintegrate.  The only item I've had that I wasn't sure of is their Breaded Mushrooms. It's not how you would imagine breaded mushrooms. Instead of breadcrumbs it's almost like the mushrooms are covered in a thin layer of dough. Not pizza dough or bread dough; it definitely had a distinct taste that was familiar but unrecognizable. At first bite it was disappointing, not because it tasted bad but because it wasn't what I expected. Of course I did the whole, \"Maybe if I try another I can figure out if I like them\" and by the third mushroom I was all about it and wanted more of them. I would simply say if you order them to keep an open mind.  Really like this place, will be ordering again in the future.",

I can't believe they served this to me with a straight face.",

    "text": "Well...I have not been thrilled about the quality of pizzerias since I have been here in Las Vegas (14 months). A lot of mediocre places and many that I will not return to. I was not anticipating anything different, but Napolis gave me a reason to return...yeah! It was just me and later in the evening. I walked in -  it was clean and I was greeted with a smile. The service was exemplary and the Napoli Special I ordered was delivered on a proper pizza tray. The pizza was piping hot and I was provided a ceramic plate with wrapped utensils (read sanitized). After an ample amount of time, my server came to ask if I wanted a refill on my drink or a box. Yes to both questions. The pizza was reasonably priced, $14.99  for a small, 16 inch pizza. Crust was yummy, crisp around the edge but not crunchy. Toppings were dispersed evenly on the pizza and the feta was a good flavor. The only thing that would have made it better would have been a little more generous amount of toppings. I will return and for now, this is my \"go to\" pizza spot. Oh - they have a very diverse menu with what appear to be some great lunch specials. Napolis rocks...the music was great...classic RnR  played low enough that conversation was no problem. I'll be  back!!",

Pizza was salty and uninspiring..... From what I have now read on other reviews this is a common thing with them. Next time I will heat up and eat an old shoe before I order from Napoli. Zero Stars",

I paid for the full amount but it was kinda of irritating when I asked if I could get the price the brochure mentioned because we couldn't of received our brochure a month ago.

I ordered a vegetarian pizza and when I received it, it had fried vegetables on it which was not mentioned on the menu or I never would have ordered it. The quality was poor, very poor and the customer service was even worse . when I called to ask for my money back, they actually referred me to the delivery company which makes no sense because the delivery company did not make the pizza. Long story short, the delivery company gave me my refund because Napoli would not. Needless to say, I'll never order from them again. They are a disgusting and despicable excuse for ANY type of pizza establishment let alone one they consider authentic.  do not fall for their commercials or ads . I honestly don't know how they're in business because I really think it's the lowest quality pizza I've ever seen in my life besides the fact that they put fried vegetables  on their vegetarian pizza. Disgusting disgusting disgusting don't go to or order from  Napoli Pizza you'll be terribly disappointed and you'll have a very hard time getting your money back. As a side note , if I could give a negative rating, it would be a minus 1000 stars!!!!!",

I work very close by & on most occasions someone else picks up the order. Some of the younger people that have gone to get our order always say the customer service is HORRIBLE. I have a feeling it may be because they aren't tipping to the staffs liking. However, like a previous reviewer stated, the wait time can be out of control. I had called an hour & 40 min ahead of time for 1 of the 36\" pizza, which we get a lot. We usually get 4 different quarters on the pizza. The last time it was ALL wrong & the pick up person waited an additional 25 min for the pizza. I will still get pizza for home, on occasion but where I work, well, everyone refuses to go pick up our order.",

I'm a chef with a culinary degree so i realize I'm pickier than most but that being said i can get down with the rest of them and enjoy stiff from other places.  Even tacos from taco hell. I ordered baked ziti and a cannoli. I love cannolis, im from jersey.  So to start you get a small salad. Which looked appetizing but everything tasted like the fridge.  If you've ever had lettuce or veg that's just been cut and in the fridge without proper containment you'll know what i mean.  It's gross.   Onto the ziti.... it looked appetizing and was a huge portion. Lots of cheese,  was so Lobb forward to it.  However, it tasted completely bland.  I dunno how you can do that with all the different cheeses and sauce but they did.  The ricotta wasn't  seasoned,  the noodles were total mush abs it tasted like the sauce was just canned tomatoes with no seasoning.  Garbage.  To add insult to injury i stopped eating after a few bites,  my appetite ruined (i dunno if you've ever craved something so bad and then when you got it and it was so far from expectation that it just instantly kills your hungry,  that's what happened to me) I figured ok can't really mess up a cannoli, right?  Wrong.  They make it look stuffed but really its a hollow she'll they just put some filling on each end abs call it good and charge you 4 bucks. For one.   Not only that but i waited an hour for delivery.   Never again.",

This was an online order placed via their website for delivery. Ordering process was easy and smooth.  The delivery arrived timely and was piping hot. I am a bit of an Italian food snob but I would give them a solid 7 out of 10 overall.  The food was good, especially if you are fond of copious amounts of delicious melted cheese. The chicken was cooked perfectly moist and tender and there was plenty of sauce to dip the delicious garlic bread to my hearts content. The 3 missing points out of 10 related to this experience.  1. Better plates and plastic utensils.  The flimsy plates and utensils are not sufficient for the substantial meal. 2.  Drain the pasta completely.  This order had a fair amount of water left in the pasta watering down the delicious sauce. 3.  Offer some fresh grated parm or ramano with this menu item. I would order from them again and would recommend this restaurnt as  solid go to for italian food.",

We also ordered the hummus platter. At first, I thought the grilled veggies that come with it looked pretty plain until I took a bite. The seasonings on them and the hummus was delicious!  We also ordered the lasagna. It came with a small side salad that actually had vegetables in it besides lettuce. It had a tomato and bell pepper slice, red onions and an olive! The lasagna came in a huge plate and was absolutely divine!  The only thing I think could improve is the delivery service. It took well over an hour to get our food but we will DEFINITELY order from there again! Yummy!!!",

I called before we got it was delivered to see where pizza was and woman was not very helpful said I would have to wait for delivery guy. When we got the pizza, it was cold, salty, and not cut well. We will never get anything from here again.",

    "text": "Did indoor dining vs delivery this time- WOW HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! Food is still good but service is a NO GO!! Ordered the $8.99 16\" 1 topping pizza, a hot pastrami sandwich w side and a drink. Lady asked what size fries w wanted w the sandwich (I kept insisting it comes w it but she would reply \"ya but what size\") long of short she charged us for the \"free side of fries\" now we have double the fries but with only 2 ppl how much can we even eat?!! A soda is $4 extra $4 for fries we didnt eat or want. When I ordered the pizza I explained it was to go- it was brought out on a tray... we asked for it to be boxed to go and she tossed a box at us to do ourselves. So now we have a bunch of fries (that were served cold) a pizza we had to try to skillfully toss from a cake tray into a box and a sandwich that didnt have anything listed on it besides meat... wheres the toppings and why did they ask when we ordered if we want everything on it if nothing was going to be placed on it?? We asked for pickles added and we got a olive on the side??! Really?! Why? Even our drink was rang up as with cherry? We never said cherry ever!! I dont get what the issues was but definitely communication issues with the gal seem to make the experience crap! Ill just stick to the simplest order 1 topping pizzas so far they never messed that up!! Ugggg date night failed thanks to incompetent people and rude staff when you explained all the issues- (pizza not boxed to go, no topping on sandwich, cherry in soda and $4 charge for the free side of fries... that were cold)",

It was so delicious and they made it just how we like it, extra crispy and not too greasy!    Minor issues, I'm a Cali girl who loves ranch on their pizza-- didn't like the $1.00 extra for such a small sample of it.  They also forgot our marinara sauce with our breaded mushroom order and we asked to sub it with more ranch, but it didn't happen.    All in all, great, delicious, authentic Italian tasting pizza!  Every time we're in Vegas and visiting family, this will definitely be a new family tradition, just get your ranch game up, lol! Thanks, Napoli!",

I'm so disappointed because I use to like this place a lot, it has gone extremely down hill. If I wish yelp had a zero star rating because that's what they would get. Not to mention another guy was eating with his family and he asked for the pizza extra Crispy and the pizza came out still doughy, and they didn't even offer to fix his pizza. I'm a server in a casino and I would get fired if I gave that kind of service to paying customers!",

Getting a very rude response from the manager they took our order once again as if we never placed the order. We were delivered a pizza 30 minutes later. My wife had ordered a large half pepperoni, what we received was a large whole pepperoni that someone decided it was OK to pick half the pepperoni off one side and throw it on the other side. This is a cardinal sin in food preparation you do not touch someone's food after it's been out of the oven. We proceeded to call the manager, after he was so unfriendly the first time I didn't expect a whole lot of customer service but I did not expect the nastiness and the combativeness. He requested I take a picture of the pizza and send it to them to verify my claim, thank goodness he asked me to do that so I can post these pictures now. I was told the manager would be in touch with me tomorrow and that they would send me a pizza to replace the mistake. I did not feel comfortable and consuming any food products from a place that thought it was acceptable to pick their fingers through my food before delivering it to me,I declined. I then proceeded to return to the store to receive a refund which I was not offered. I returned the pizza to the person that I spoke to on the phone he went to the back and after waiting an inordinate  amount of time, I began to question what is going on.I had to actually raise my voice and demand my money back before somebody came out and tried to give me five dollars less than I paid for the pizza as you can imagine I will never set foot in Napoli Pizza anywhere in this town.",

In two separate slices. I still ate them because I was hungry and I called and the guy that answered stated all his employees were wearing hair nets and that he didn't know how the hairs got into my pizza. I have like a brown inch long hair and these hairs were like black and a foot long. And all this happened after I had already ate some wings and over half my pizza so I couldn't take it back. I think I'll go to a different location next time",

Umm, since when does a cold sandwich come looking like a fucking chefs salad. Almost no roast beef. But at least an entire head of lettuce, at least one full tomato barely sliced into fourths, a whole red onion with the goddamn skin and sprouts still on it. Then comes the Stromboli. I asked for a strom with only cheese, pep and salami, small one. It gets here, I tell the driver that I got charged for a large strom. He argues with me, I have the receipt in my hand. I then show him that it is filled with 6 other ingredients, he leaves. I call. They put a credit on my phone number for a future order. I'm never going to use this credit, so if anyone in the Henderson area wants to use my phone number for a $20.00 credit let me know. I'll only ask for $5.00 cash in return. They didn't even offer to make the correct order for me. Fucking bullshit.",

When I arrived I ordered the 16 inch pizza with 1 topping of pepperoni along with 10 chicken wings hot and side of fries plus two beers total came to $29.21. The service was excellent had our pizza within 15 minutes, the table arrangement allows for a lot of foot traffic between tables people picking up takeout orders, which makes for a poor dining experience.  The Pizza was too salty and not good, hot wings were good, would not recommend this place, if their signature dish which is pizza is too salty.",

They are pleasant behind the registers but they could turn down the ringers on those phones as they are VERY loud!   We get it, you guys are busy and popular but those phones can make you jump out of your chairs!  Turn 'em down just a bit!  Other than that, we love their pies!!  Keep up the good work!",

When my husband order she says \"are you sure you don't want the 18 inch CARRY OUT special?\" is that what we said we wanted? She SCOFFS at us after we wanted the bigger one. She was so condescending and rude. It was so bad I thought we were getting punked! Like a real life Bon Qui Qui.

My sister insisted on eating here because she said they take too long for delivery, came in on a Sunday night and this place was popping! We grabbed some menus and sat down and talked about what we wanted. We went for two medium pizzas with cheese, sausage and pepperoni. We also ordered some sides:  -Honey BBQ wings: DELICIOUS! It was soo good we went back last night to pick some more up! They fry the wings so good, not overly greasy or dry. Cooked perfectly! I love the sauce, I'm a saucy person so these wings are perfect for me! Also the first time I ordered them I wanted the fries but they didn't give it to us but when we ordered our take out last night and we got the fries and they are huge!! A whole box of fries for a dollar more is a great deal!   -Breadsticks: OMG I could eat those allll day! They were soo fluffy and delicious! We devoured those!! Especially with ranch! NOM NOM!  -Caprese salad: This was a bit different from other Caprese salads I've had in the past, instead of a balsamic drizzle it had a spicy olive type dressing, I didn't care for it but the mozzarella was sooo good!   -Pizza: The crust was good but it was dry and lacked seasonings/sauce on the pizza, I really didn't care for it too much but it was a hit for every one else.  We ate pretty good for under $45.00 dollars but I did see that their baked pastas are extremely pricey, $16.99 for pasta?! Um thanks but no thanks!  This will be my go to spot for chicken wings!!  ^__^",

The man on the phone was extremely rude to begin with and at the end of our conversation without giving me a total he just hung up. So I figured it would be around $65 after taxes and we waited our 40 minute wait time to  go to pick it up and the same man started off being rude to my wife then went on trying to charge us 80 something dollars for our order and when we advised him that that's not what the special says on our pamphlet he yells at my wife and says well these are new prices. obviously we did not finish or complete our order and we left.

We decided to order take out for movie night and tried napolis   We ordered a 16\" 4 topping topping pizza, wing dings, fries, and garlic bread sticks. The pizza is decent, I wish I would have ordered it well done because it was a bit under. The wingdings come with fries and have different sauces you can choose. We ordered the wingdings with hot sauce, it had very good flavor, My biggest concern with them is that they were heavily breaded and deepfried. It made them very mushy when coated with sauce. The fries were also mushy aswell. The bread was very good when fresh, the next day they were as hard as rocks.  This place is very overpriced now, and over the years they have added many things to the menu that kind of make it over complicated (I'm talking about the non Italian foods).  For me I come here due to convenience, it is very close to my house and is open very late. The food is fresh but the service is a bit sketchy. I can't help but feel like I am bothering the employees when I come in. I would recommend coming here out of desperation,  due to the price being so high.",

We decided to order from them on a Tuesday night from Bite Squad. I figured it would be a better delivery but I was wrong. Bite Squad didn't deliver, Napoli's did...TWO HOURS after the order was placed. I had to get online with Bite Squad an hour in and they contacted Napoli's and were put on hold for a long time, finally coming back to tell them they needed 25 more minutes till they were able to deliver the order. Good freaking Gawds. They did not get a good excuse from Napoli's. We ended up getting credit from Bite Squad for having to put up with this ridiculous crap.  Driver brings our food, a deep dish pizza and salad. (So not worth the $28.99 they charged for the pizza!) The driver told me that our order had to be remade. WHAT?! We couldn't be called and told that?! The pizza ended up being somewhat warm at best and extremely salty. The antipasto salad was the best item of the whole thing. Two slices of pizza and the rest went in the trash the next day. Worthless.  We are done. Just done.",

Told her about the online experience, she said she's not sure what went wrong, but they do in fact service our area. Literally spent 30 minutes simply trying to convey our address. She had a problem listening, kept interrupting, never got it right even after multiple spellings and repeating the cross street. The actual pizza order was easy, until I mentioned the freebie on the flyer they sent me.   Flyer promised \"Free garlic balls if you text\" - with no caveat. It is a bait and switch. They don't mean it. No free garlic balls. She rudely put me on hold, then a man answered. He went into a song and dance about how the text wasn't working correctly and I was supposed to follow a link to download their special app and then come into the store in order to receive their stupid less than $5 incentive.  I said that if you're willing to argue that much over something so cheap instead of just giving it to us as first time customers, it wasn't worth being customers at all. We ended up ordering from dominos.",

So the delivery guy came to the room and right before he left we opened the box and the pizza was wrong no toppings . So I called and I was put on hold for over 5 mins then I was told that the toppings were put on the pizza... Are they invisible toppings?  they proceeded to tell  me that they would make us another pizza .... Ummm no we are extremely hungry after waiting over an hour for the wrong food ... Because we felt bad for the driver I have him a $20 and said thank you... If we lived here or not this pizza joint needs better customer service and better communication w  I'm giving one star because we actually got a pizza it was ok probably because everyone was so hungry DO BETTER",

The crust is a complete failure! The outside crust is basically the thick crust style, but underneath completely made my jaw drop! There is the thinnest, I mean paper thin crust, and at least a 5 inch diameter in the middle with absolutely no crust. This is the most pathetic pizza ever! The only reason I almost gave 2 stars is because they loaded it up with cheese, and I love cheese, but I will never order from here again!!! See pics!",

The pizza is not what I call 100% New York style, the crust was a little too thick and the sauce to cheese ratio was off, but I'm super picky about my pizza. The rest of the group really enjoyed the pizza. It reheated in the oven really well, so plan on extra for some leftovers.",

Beginning with receiving a disgusting meatball sub that was soaked at the bottom causing the bread to be gummy & wet. It was the worst sandwich sub I've ever experienced. Upon calling the restaurant, the manager refused to replace the sandwich without it being brought in. I brought in the sandwich displaying its soaking wet bottom, & at that point he decides to apologize and replace it with something else on the menu. With my forgiving personality I decided to let go his brashness from earlier on the phone when he rudely told me he would do nothing for me. Now upon calling his restaurant two months later to give it another try. He as my number listed as no service. Worst service I've received from anywhere! I believe the manager'a name is Harry! Replace him, and I guarantee your restaurant will generate lots of additional revenue. The customer service is lacking to say the least with his leadership. Highly disappointed!",

The pizza can get a tad bit greasy but any napkin can take care of that. I recommend the Napoli special, which was what we got. The service on the other hand, could've been better. We sat down outside for a little over a half hour and still didn't receive our pizza. We got excited when the waitress approached us with a pizza but we were let down finding out that it was the wrong one. We then waited another 10-15 minutes and finally got the correct one. It was delicious and the people working here were very friendly and supportive. It was a Friday when we came here so business was a little hectic involving the take out orders, so we were forgiving. Overall, it was a good meal, but I recommend ordering it for take out instead of sitting down.",

These girls were busting their asses, while the clowns were just standing around. Nice. No one asked, can I help you? How is everything...nothing. There must have been 10-15 guys that came in and made a beeline towards the back. Not one of them said hello, how ya doin', NOTHING. I almost walked out just because of the negativity these guys were giving off. Sorry, if that's the way you are gonna run your biz, then I'm never coming back.   Food: burnt on the bottom of the pizza. Really? You are going to burn PIZZA?? Not only are these guys not Italian, they can't even make a pizza? Wtf?

My friend got a burger and only ate half, she said the meat was so dry she couldn't finish it.

    "text": "Roaming the streets, we struck out on the first three places we tried to visit for dinner. Establishments we found on Yelp were all closed for good. A sign caught my eye, with lights shining through the windows, Napoli Pizza! My co-workers go to the one by work all the time and rave about it. This one had to be good too, right?  We walked inside, and started looking at the menu. Deciding on what we wanted, we started to order. The cashier took my order easily, yet when my wife asked what was on her pizza, the lady had to look at the menu, then ask someone else. This may have been because she was new, who knows. We won't knock that too much.  There were a couple staff members just sitting by the counter while their compatriots were busy with customers. There were two tables already eating, as well as a few phone orders that were coming in while we were there. It did not look crazy busy though, just a nice steady flow of business.  We paid, received our drinks, sat down and continued our conversation from earlier.  10-15 minutes later, my pizza came out. Not a strange occurrence,  as between the pizza and little stand, the staff member's hands were quite full.  I was halfway through a large pizza before another staff member came near us, she made the effort for customer service to offhandedly ask how everything was. She was lucky to have asked without fully looking at our table, as the rage in my wife's eyes would have burned a searing memory into the girl's soul, and my wife replied, \"know where my pizza is?\" or something along those lines. Of course, the immediate answer was, \"oh it should be coming out in just a few minutes. This was already a good ten+ minutes since I had my food.  It was almost 45 minutes (total) before they got her pizza out!!!1! They forgot to make one of the two pizzas on our order. As I said, they were steady busy, but busier screwing around (appeared that way anyhow) than making sure orders went out right.  The pizza tasted alright, maybe it would have been better if the bitter taste of rage did not creep into our minds.   We may give another Napoli a chance again, but this one is on our avoid list.",

    "text": "Our office had received Napoli's menu in the mail and were exited to try some of the lunch specials located on the back of the menu. We set a date to order for the office the week following receiving the flyer in the mail. We ordered 2 lunch specials, both priced at $6.99 on the menu. I was made to repeat the order several times to the lady on the phone (who was not particularly nice). I was then given a price which seamed a little higher than i had anticipated for 2 lunch orders. Upon verification of the prices, she explained that the lunch specials that i had ordered were $7.99. i explained that i had just received this menu circular in the mail the previous week. She stated that she would provide our office with a new menu and then went on to tell me that the order would be delivered in an hour, which was perfect since our lunch break would be at that exact time of delivery. (ordered at 11:32). I decided not to haggle with the pricing and left it alone since i understand pricing does change without notice.  A little over an hour later and 5 minutes into our lunch break, our food had still not arrived. I called back and spoke with the same lady who had taken our order. Before checking on our order status she started to brush me off by stating that it takes an hour for delivery. I stopped her and explained that it had been that long already and explained that me and my coworker are allowed a limited amount of time for or lunch. She then huffed and stated she would look to see when our order was placed to make sure it had actually been an hour. After verifying that , yes, it had indeed been OVER an hour she began to check on the order status and explained that it may be about 7 minutes more before we would receive our order.   I spoke with my co-worker who agreed with me that this was way more trouble than it was worth, not to mention by the time our food would arrive (given it would arrive in \"7 minutes\") we would then only be left with 10 minutes to eat. I called back and then spoke with a gentleman (may have been in some sort of manager). I began to explain the situation with the menu pricing, he interrupted me and stated he would give me 5 dollars off my order. I explained to him that at this point we would just like to cancel our order and i did not feel that $5 would justify such bad service. He did not seem to care either way at the loss of a customer and hung up. I later noticed on the menu they advertise \"Fast Delivery\", yeah that's a complete joke!",

    "text": "I LOVE PIZZA!!!!!!!!!  I'm from California, I was visiting in Nevada and we wanted pizza. So the hotel we stayed at recommended Napoli. We really enjoyed it, the pizza was really extremely good the marinara is very zesty. I will admit that California cheese makes pizza taste awesome. But this pizza is really great, I WILL DEFINITELY ORDER PIZZA FROM HERE AGAIN.  We also ordered mozzarella sticks, diner salad and hot wings. The mozzarella sticks where really bland no taste what so ever. The salad was kinda normal, I mean really how much can you say about a salad, right. The wings where really tasty, but it did not make a big statement they where just OK.  But if you want a tasty pizza, you really need to try this place.",

    "text": "OMG! What took us so long to try this restaurant?! It's next door to another place we like. So in the mail we get a menu and today we decided to give it a try. After looking over the menu I grabbed a pen and put stars next to \"everything\" I wanted to try. I am a big fan of fried zucchini and theirs is my new favorite! There was so much that I was able to save some for tomorrow. We also ordered a medium pizza  half 5-cheese and half pepperoni. It came in a box the size of a bicycle wheel. In it, on my 5-cheese side it was very rustic with dollops of ricotta, feta, with provolone, mozzarella & Parmesan. And it tasted so amazing! The crust was both chewy & crunchy. My husband liked his pepperoni side so much he ate all 4 pieces. I have 2 slices tucked in the frig next to my zucchini. The icing on the cake is that I have some Tiramisu in the frig waiting to be eaten later tonight. We are new fans of Napoli Pizza & Restaurant, looking forward to dining on the patio. Give this place a try you will be pleasantly surprised at how great the food is.",

We love the food, especially their hot chicken fingers and spicy traditional wings, but we also love the great service we receive. While I will admit their prices may be a little bit higher than traditional pizza places, the quality of food you receive is well worth the cost. Our favorite special to order is the #10 anytime special which includes a large one topping pizza, 10 chicken fingers, fries, and a 2 liter soda. I come from a family of 5 siblings so we order this meal to make sure everyone has enough food they can enjoy and typically, we tend to have left overs at the end, which are even better the next day. So if you're looking for a great pizza and wing joint, this is the place to go. Stop in or order delivery, but either way, you'll certainly be glad you tried this place.",

    "text": "The GOOD: The decor, the proximity to my borrowed address & the carryout specials (if you are fortunate enough to actually walk inside, as they are NOT posted on the ordering site/app).  The BAD...The customer service is atrocious! The young ladies at the front counter (young blonde w/ an accent & a young curly haired brunette - both female) seriously lack in delivering great customer service, and they make no apologies in regards to it. When they messed up my SIMPLE pizza order (I requested that half have meat and half be left w/ only cheese), they snickered as I walked in and began whispering, never greeted me, and when I explained my issue with the pizza, one of them took my pizza to their sanitary kitchen, after the pizza had left from the restaurant, a slice bitten into (as my sister did not know that I had requested half w/ meat and had taken a bite of one slice) and handled by multiple people. You would think that they would make me a fresh pizza, as this was their mistake..NO SUCH THING OCCURRED.  After several minutes, and my having to ask when my order would be ready (assuming that I was waiting for a brand new, correct pizza); I was handed my same pizza, bitten cheese slice and all, w/ cold pepperoni thrown on half of the pie, and all at the very same temperature.  No apologies were given.  No attempt at actually producing quality food and service...just bad all the way around!   Being sanitary is not something I am willing to overlook, and I have to wonder if this is a common practice if food is sent back.  I made several attempts to reach management, and each time that I called, the young ladies were unpleasant and kept telling me that he would be in later and later. I finally wrote a complaint through the website, and I did receive a call back soon after.  Unfortunately, the Manager seemed rushed, uninterested and like he just wanted to get me off the phone; he offered to make me another pizza or give me credit, but the point, the principal was not to receive complimentary items, as I did not/do not feel comfortable eating here again, as I believe it is unsanitary. The principal was to make him aware of how the business is run in his absence, and how I had been treated as a paying customer...I guess it's run the same no matter what.   Needless to say, I will never be returning to this establishment again.  Customers deserve to be treated w/ respect, dignity, made to feel appreciated and like their hard-earned monies matter.  Associates should not feel that it is okay to whisper about, laugh at, and talk badly about customers, and the owners/management should not tolerate such behavior.",

I really like that they actually listened to us and were very kind to us.    The pizza itself was a large cheese and was very tasty and although I don't usually come here due to having other favorite pizza joints around Henderson, there isn't a reason why I won't find myself here again.

(It would have been nice to have been called and informed) The guy told me it would be an additional 7-8 minutes before the food would be done. So we ended up waiting TWO hours for our order. I had very hungry kids who I ended up feeding before the pizza came.  The pizza was a 30' pizza so it arrived cold. The wings and fries were cold.

The hot sandwiches are all great. Fries leave a bit to be desired but, outside of that the place is awesome. Hot wings are HOT I suggest you try the medium first before going off the deep end. Highly recommended this place for great cheap eats.",

    "text": "We came here despite the reviews. Maybe this is one of those hit-or-miss spots but we had decent food & decent service.   We sat outside under a covered cuppola. After my husband ordered a server brought out plates & silverware & drinks within five minutes. The pizza took about 20 minutes, which was fine as we ordered special pizzas.   The veggie pizza was good, as was our cheese/pepperoni pizza. The crust was thin like i like it, crispy on the bottom, not too greasy. And we actually added a little salt. The pepperoni pizza was a bit greasy but thats to be expected with pepperoni.   I went in to get a refill on our drinks and it was free.   I think maybe part of the problem with other reviews regarding the service is that east coast style pizzarias usually dont serve you and folks out here dont seem to be used to that. Ive seen this phenomenon out here on several occasions.   We did go in to use the restrooms and they were very clean. So was the restaurant.   A solid 4 stars.",

I waited at my home for 1 hour and 15mins only to call back and find out that she cancelled my order.

I have been a fan of the food especially the wings and pizza. but the service was always lacking. even though we loved the food the lack of customer service made us look elsewhere for our pizza.   Tonight we gave it one last chance. and what we got was the wrong item. I know what you're saying \"the wrong item hardly merits 1 star\" and you would be right however when that item it comprised from the losing vegetables from the 1957 Nebraska state fair, and made with the same love and devotion that Susan Smith showed her children one star is more than enough. My dogs literally would not eat this and i had to put a lock on the laundry room door to prevent them from eating cat turds.",

No big deal, right. I was told about 30-45 minutes. I waited for 90 minutes and still NO PIZZA! I called and like a previous post said, was put on hold for over 10 minutes. They finally came on the phone and simply stated the guy was on his way. Another 30 minutes and still no pizza. I went up to the lobby to see if there was another place I could call for some food as I was falling asleep waiting. As I was waiting to talk to the desk person the pizza guy walks in! Mind you this is over 2 hours after I ordered. He asks my name and hands me the receipt to sign and the pizza. The box didn't feel even warm, so I opened it and sure enough it was cold. I complained to him and he could have cared less. Needless to say, I didn't tip very much. I took my cold pizza back to my room and ate it cold as I was too tired to fight this place. BEWARE. They are rude and have no customer service whatsoever. If you don't mind waiting forever for a cold pizza, this is the place for you.",

The Dr. Pepper was flat.  That's fine, sometimes places have issues with the fountain, totally understandable.  Well, more than 20 minutes after ordering, I had not received my 2 slices of pizza.  I came around 12:45.  Later during lunch time, I'll grant you, but still the common lunch period for a restaurant.  It's not like I came at 2:50 asking for the lunch special.  There were only 2 other tables with customers seated (so it wasn't crowded), and no one came to tell me there was an issue with my order.  So, I went back to the counter and asked.  The employee didn't say anything, but went to the back.  I was then told by another employee that my pizza was coming.    My pizza was brought to me, and I was informed they had to make a fresh pie for my order.  That would have been fine, I'm certainly not going to complain about freshly made food.  But, an apology, or letting me know it was happening, anything would have been appropriate here given the amount of time it took to fill a very simple order.  The slices are ENORMOUS.  It's a crazy amount of food for $5.99.  Just enormous.  But, there were a few problems with the pizza.  First, the topping distribution was off, with about 70% of the toppings being located on the lower 1/3 of each slice.  This slipping could have occurred when they were putting the slices on the plate, so that may be understandable.  But, the bottom was not crispy, except in places (near the top) that it was burnt.  So, I did not get the good crust that you typically get with thin crust pizza (and is the reason I prefer it to deep dish).  Finally, it was undersauced significantly.  I'm guessing they hurried in the back making it, but each little mistake added up quickly.  The menu is diverse and some things looked very good.  I may try to order some pizzas to go next time we have people over and want pizza for dinner.  But, my lunch experience left a lot to be desired.",

Their pizzas are one of the best I have tasted in Las Vegas, so much so I put up with their terrible customer service.  I raved to everyone I knew about Napolis, that is until one unfortunate day.  I ordered a pizza and chicken wings.  I picked them up and they were both cold, and I excused them, again (like their horrible customer service) thinking maybe I had taken to long to get there to pick up the food.  But my guests at home weren't convinced, they said the pizza tasted more than a few minutes old, they said it tasted like hours old.  I ignored them,  and then, I bit into the pizza crust only to find a strand of hair cooked right into it...  Another one of my guests found a foreign object on the pizza, like a fiber from a cleaning sponge...  I was so mortified....   I called Napolis and they offered me a refund, only for the pizza, that's ok, but I never received the refund.  Not only that but I got sick to my stomach, for a whole day, I was really sick.... I am pretty sad, but I am never stepping a foot in Napolis again.",

When the delivery driver dropped the order off he forgot to drop off the pizza. It took him about 20 minutes to circle back around. They gave us the 2 slices and drink on the house. I called to complain about the blt and the manager basically said it is what it is.  On their pamphlet it also mentions there is a $1.50 delivery fee but I was charged $4.50 because we were out of their range, hich I understand but they might want to add that disclaimer on their handout menu. They also do a $1.00 credit card fee. Most likely will not be ordering from them again. Only reason I'm giving them a 2 star is because I used to go to their Sahara location and always enjoyed it.",

I ordered a pizza the morning of Super Bowl Sunday and was given a time of 1:30pm to pick up. I arrived at 2:00pm and stood in a makeshift line where I was cut in front of several times. When I got to the counter the girl found my ticket and charged me $30.00 for my pizza. She left with my ticket and said Ill be right back with your pizza. 30 minutes later the same girl comes from the back and never addresses me. She begins to help other customers. I approach a different employee and ask her where my pizza is. She goes to the back and comes out with a large man who tells me that my order has been canceled. I never canceled the order! I explained to him that I didn't cancel the order and that I just wanted my money back. The large man said I could wait for my pizza instead. I told him that I would not be waiting two hours for a pizza I ordered ahead of time. I also asked why they had charged me and made me wait 30 minutes if the order was canceled. I was not given a coherent answer. I couldn't even understand what the guy said. After i insisted on my money back the guy started the return and moved to several registers as he threw things around. I asked him why he was mad at me since I'm pretty sure they gave away my pizza and tried to blame it on me cancelling it. He said \"I was talking to her not you sir\". I told him that I didn't appreciate his attitude and that he should be nicer to his coworker also. After a long wait my return was processed and I left WITHOUT PIZZA! Do not go here if you're hungry or expect to be treated like a person!",

What poor customer service! They need to hire delivery drivers that are smart enough to follow simple directions or look at a map. My food finally arrived at 10:00 and aside from being cold, still wasn't any good.  They charged me full price. Save yourself the trouble and order from rosati's, Pizza Hut, or anywhere else. Don't give these idiots your business.",

We ordered a sausage, green pepper and mushroom pizza tonight, and when it was delivered it was not cooked through. After reheating in our oven for 20 minutes, it still wasn't cooked.  I called napolis to let them know, only to be told they would put a note in my account for next time, that I would prefer it to be cooked through.  No thank you, I will not be ordering from you again.",

The crust was tasty and baked to a nice toasty brown so as to be firm, yet soft. The sauce had a good flavor without being overpowering and combined with the sausage and pepperoni for an enjoyable assault on my taste buds. The service was fast, friendly and definitely very welcoming. We didn't sample the famed 30 inch pizza, but I plan on going back and doing just that in the near future.

Worst thing was the price was more than $36 for two for the poorest quality chicken ever. We should have returned the dishes right away, but we were not ready to hurt somebody's feeling whoever so-called chef in the kitchen.. I've never had and even seen that soupy, oily marsala before. We were in awe-struck and stunned by the shock. We couldn't eat those, anyhow we didn't put it on complaint  that day. But whenever it comes to my mind, i feel like i have to write a right review for others like us. But the pizza was not bad, actually it was more than average. It was the Nightmare chicken!",

Minus 1 star for waiting so long for drinks. Customer service was meh besides that, and I'm pretty sure the girl that took our order was new.

When the teenagers are hustling but the manager on duty seems to be clueless, you have a problem. The sandwich we ordered was soggy on the bottom, burnt on the top, the sausage was not cooked all the way through, and you can get better meatballs out of the freezer section of your local grocery store. The Greek pizza was blah. The dough tasted like cardboard, the sauce had no flavor, and the only thing that was Greek about it was the saltiness of the food service olives. In short, this was one of the most underwhelming food experiences we've had in Vegas. 1 star, and even that hasn't been earned in this case.",

    "text": "I reviewed Napoli on Sahara a couple of years ago and I was sold on it. Great food, great prices and quick delivery. I've moved since then and now order from the Napoli over here on the east side of town on Warm Springs, I think. Three words: don't do it. No matter how hungry you are, don't do it.  I spent $40 for garlic balls, two small drinks, desert and one entree that came with salad and garlic bread. Pricey, yes, but I liked their food. Or so I thought.  First, the guy forgot the garlic balls. I called to let them know and they said they'd give me a credit. Nope. Not gonna happen, send his happy butt back here with my money.   In the meantime, we opened the baked ravioli container and almost lost it. The marinara sauce was swimming in water,like the cook neglected to drain the pasta before saucing it. It was dark brown, too, not a rich red. When we dug in, the whole mess was cold. Cheese congealed over the top, watery sauce and the marinara sauce had so much basil in it, it was like eating a hot chili pepper. Then, to top it off, the garlic bread was old and hard.  We ended up throwing the entree and bread down the drain and split the tiny salad and figured we'd have the desert and be somewhat not hungry. Wrong again. The cake was stale and hard. Even the frosting looked old. Like it had been around for way too long.  So, basically, I paid $40 for two drinks and a tiny salad. I called the manager and he said he was going to check with the cook. Check this out: he comes back to the phone and tells me \"The cook says there was nothing wrong with the pasta.\"  Unbelievably awful food, even worse customer service and their prices? Who are they trying to kid? Stay away, folks, Napoli used to be good and now it's garbage.",

The crust has a nice texture, thin and crispy with enough backbone to hold up to their toppings. We had their vegetarian pizza last and I enjoyed it quite a bit, with lots of olives and cheese as well as a few other toppings sprinkled on.   We also had a calzone, but I was less impressed with the end result of that one. It was largely dough and cheese with a few toppings, making it really heavy. It wasn't terribly greasy, but all the ricotta was very rich.   Our delivery time was somewhere around 45 minutes to an hour, which isn't terrible considering the distance the delivery driver had to cover. For a medium pizza and medium calzone our total was around $35, so next time we'll probably upgrade to the next size up and just have the pizza.   Their menu is pretty extensive, however, so there are plenty of side dishes, pastas and subs to choose from if you're not in the mood for pizza!",

I sat waiting for my order while customers came in ordered and left with their pizza.  When the staff finally took the time to see if my order was ready, they came to find it had been ready for  over 10 min.  No apologies or anything.  Thanks for the cold pizza and the cold shoulder.  Go to Metro Pizza and you'll be much happier.",

I've ordered from them at like 1 in the morning because I really wanted pizza and decided they were the only ones open. Be that as it may, the food is lackluster at best. For those of you that are in love with it, try Verrazano's on Windmill next time and tell me what you think. Napoli blows. Like I said, the only reason to order from here is because it's super late and nobody else is delivering. And yeah, even then you have to wait 45 minutes to over an hour so have fun with that.   p.s.- you may also find on occasion that the bottom of your pizza is burned or a little black. Again, garbage. This has happened to me more than once.",

When I went to get it, the lady who rang me up never, and I mean never, made eye-contact with me. She was short with me and everyone who called trying to place an order. After I paid, she went to the back to get my pizza and set it down at the farthest end of the counter instead of handing it to me..all while completely refusing to make eye contact. To make matters worse, the pizza looked like an oil field. There was a thick layer of grease over the pie. The strangest thing is that our pizza had like four pepperonis. They totally skimped on the topping. $7.99 is supposed to mean you get a deal, not crap. For what I got, I might as well order from Pizza Hut next time where at least I can expect consistency.",

I liked the chicken caesar salad and garlic balls, but the fi didn't like the wings, and the calzone was soggy by the time it reached us.   Verdict: I'd give them another try.. apparently they are open 24 hours, so that's pretty cool. Seems like a good place to order from if you want delivery from not your average pizza joint.",

They have a take out special, 16\" cheese w/one topping. We don't get this extra topping, just cheese. We tried the extra cheese but it just becomes too much. We add wings with fries. We order extra crispy on the wings. The 3/4 times we've ordered them it's never crispy.  I decided to write a review because we are now done with Napoli Pizza. It's very frustrating to order take out get home and it's not correct. I trust people get it right. I have to realize it's just people and they make mistakes but now it's just inconsistency.

Garlic knots are amazing as well! They have a super speedy delivery and really easy to order online and pick.   The food is great AND they're convenient: making this place perfect in my opinion.

I asked her how long it would take and she said no more than 30m. After waiting another hour we called the restaurant AGAIN and asked where our food was and she said that it will arrive soon. Finally the delivery arrived the pizza is COLD and the driver didnt offer an apology or even acknowledge that something was wrong.

    "text": "Very hit or miss, but tonight was their last miss. I'm done. I can handle an order not being prepared properly. I can't handle apathy or indifference on the part of management.  My parents are elderly. My dad loves pizza and I can usually count on Napoli's to be good... not always great, but good.  My mother is elderly and extremely sensitive to anything spicy. She has also just had all of her teeth removed. For this reason, I ordered linguine with shrimp in garlic sauce the last two times we ordered from here. The last time, it was perfection. Not exaggerating. Perfection.  Tonight, my sister and I had had a long day of running errands and had left our parents in the hands of a caregiver. We were exhausted and needed to solve dinner for our parents. I placed an order before we got home because I still had to take our caregiver home and stop at the grocery store.  Before I even got home, I got a call from my sister saying mom's order was super spicy. I called Napoli to complain. The manager spoke with the cook and said, \"sorry. The cook said he's prepared it the same way all night and no one else has complained.\" Okay... and that does what for me?  I finally got home and tasted it myself. Just looking at it, I was apprehensive. It was swimming in oil. Not a good sign. I tasted it. It was beyond bad, with overcooked shrimp and the entire mess was swimming in oil and very peppery, even for my sister and me, and neither of us have a problem eating pepper. It's just not how we want that particular dish seasoned. Even if I could \"doctor\" it for one of us, the shrimp were overcooked and it still didn't solve the problem of nothing to eat for my mom. I was exhausted and angry and my sister went and picked up something else for mom while I sat and ate overcooked pizza. The linguine will be thrown away. That was $20 down the drain.   The lack of consistency has always been a problem, but the food has always been flavorful. Inedible doesn't cut it. Nor does indifference on the part of management. Done.",

Came in to order two lunch specials to go. The person who took my order looked like a boy band refugee, and proceeded to charge me $74.61 for two lunch orders. Evidently, he was using the catering order screen. When I questioned him, the manager came out and explained that he was using the wrong screen. So, I paid $15 and change for two lunch specials. I waited for over 30 minutes. I finally asked the girl at the counter to find my order. She returned with the two meals. The pizza box was oily, and didn't have that \"warm\" feeling. I thought that was just because it was so hot out. I drive out of the parking lot, only to return when I realized that they forgot to give me the two beverages that went with the lunch specials. I explained what happened to the manager, who was behind the counter, he said he would remake my order. He didn't, simply warmed it in the oven. The girl behind the counter gave me the two sodas. I explained that I hadn't eaten today, and was looking forward to warm food. She said, \"No wonder you're cranky.\" Now, that's awesome customer service! I got home to find the two slices of pizza hard, dry, cold, and congealed to the box, and the chicken fingers and fries were wet and limp. Everything was tasteless and bland. I'm not going back there ever.",

    "text": "What can I say/post. Let's give it a try..  The Good: They are one of the only 24 hour delivery places in bad areas of east/southeast Vegas. Their garlic knot balls are pretty good and only 3 bucks. Their marinara for said balls is also good.  The Bad: Hmmm. Where to start.. Their pizza is LITERALLY on par with Cici's buffet, at best. If you compared this place to say..Gramaldi's, you would say there's no way Napoli could even spell \"New York,\" let alone came from there. The mozzarella is the same type used on Little Caesars. For what they charge, it should be better quality. Authentic, quality moz forms little \"puddles\" or areas on the pizza. Low quality doesn't taste the same and is stringy and forms a solid layer across the pizza.. which is alright if I'm drunk.  They charge $4 for a 2liter of soda. Hahaha, yep. FOUR dollars. It's a marketing ploy, obviously. A lot of their \"Daily Specials\" come with a 2 liter soda included, so you think that's a \"$4 value\" you're getting. Naw. Your getting maybe a $1.50 value.  Ordered the large salad. For the price, it should have meat. Whether chicken or salami/pepperoni. Nope. Just wilted lettuce, tomatoes, and 2 peppers. Their ranch is the thick stuff you have to dig outta the container with a spoon or knife.. not the good buttermilk ranch that runs all over the salad.  Ordered the sampler platter. Substituted fries for the zucchini sticks. They acted like they were doing me a favor, when in reality, I was saving THEM money with the switch. The sampler was 75-80% fries. Barely any of the other stuff.. and the breaded mushrooms were filled with HOT water and squishy rubber mushrooms.   Understand, there's nothing here that tastes home made. I'm from the Midwest where sauces are made from scratch, breaded appetizers are beer battered, and the pizza uses quality cheeses.   Check out my other reviews. I'm not picky. I'm just picky about wasting my money.   On a side note, their chicken wings, which are one of their \"specialties,\" are halfway decent. I honestly like Albertson's wing kiosk better, but these are ok at Napoli's.. just don't get the garlic wings. A little to soaked and soggy for my liking..",

First off, when I called to place the order the guy was very friendly over the phone, however he told me 30 minutes and when I got there I ended up waiting about an additional 20 minutes. One thing I was amazed at was the amount of food you get, I only paid $33 dollars and got 2 small pizzas (for anyone who has never seen a Napoli pizza, their small is basically the equivalent of every other pizza places large!), an order of garlic balls and a two liter. Even though I had to wait the extra time, it was totally worth it! The garlic balls were soooo yummy!! And the specialty ranch pizza was DELICIOUS! I am a huge ranch fan so this really hit the spot and the chicken they put on top isn't crappy out of a can chicken, it's crunchy and yummy! As for the pepperoni pizza, it was good, nothing special, just your average pepperoni pizza. If you are going to order Napoli's, I'd suggest getting a specialty pizza!! The only reason I docked a pint was for the extra wait, really I would have only taken 1/2 a point, but that wasn't an option haha. Anyways, I would definitely suggest Napoli's Pizza to anyone who is craving some great pizza!",

I have also had difficulties with their menu posted online. This is their menu and to say that their online menu is outdated goes along with management. Please manage your ads if don't plan on honoring them. The pizza is still very good but everything else is sub par. Their potato skins cost 6.99  and the order consists of 5 pieces of small potatoes but very little goes into preparing. I can do what they did in the time I waited for my order (placed order at 5:54 and left at 6:40). They probably wrapped 3 potatoes in a wet paper towel and zapped them in the microwave for 5 minutes, halved and cored them, then poured some cheese wiz and sprinkled them with chopped bacon and chives. Then put them back in the oven for 5 to 10 minutes more. That make up is the sign of a cook who hates his job. As I sat their for 30+ minutes, my chair faced the hand washing sink. They must have had 8 employees traversing kitchen area to outside to cashier back to kitchen and serving in-house guests. But that sink did not have one single use.  The hallway to the restrooms was lined with the boxes used to contain outgoing pizzas- 2 stacks had their plastic partially removed with inside part facing out. Meaning that anyone going to or fro the restrooms can easily touch those boxes, and though it is proper to clean hands after visiting such, it is not always done.  Unless they remedy that situation, I would not recommend ordering their giant or 14\" pies.",

I order the special $5.99 pizza special and apparently they forgot to cook the order until I came to the girl at the front. She said she would check but did not until I came to the counter 2nd time.  She finally went to the back and I recd my order 45 minutes later. and I told the girl to wrap it up as my lunch time was over.   She kept saying \"Im sorry so sorry\".  I think they totally forgot about it.  The pizza was good but not sure If I will be going back soon.",

The sauces they have are good, though they are not always put on the same from pizza to pizza. The cheeses are good. I enjoy the plain cheese, 5 cheese pizza, ranch style etc. I'm basically down with any of their pizzas, as long as it doesn't involve mushrooms!",

It's 3 am and I am eating :)     Their delivery takes a long time, but I live almost to lake mead, so I am glad they deliver!!!    Everything I've ever ordered has been delicious, and tonight's smorgasbord is right on par :)    I'm eating the spaghetti and meatballs, a gorgeous egg chef salad, and 2 cannoli.   The cannoli look extremely fresh, like someone just put the cheesy stuff in!!   I'm glad I ordered extra meatballs.   I was reading the reviews and someone said meatballs and it sounded really good.    I really like their pizza, especially the chicken ranch, or creating my own.   I don't usually like pizza, so this says something :)",

When my boyfriend, my daughter and myself arrived there were no customers in the place.(I see why now) The employees were sitting at a table eating lunch and God forbid they actually get up and do their job. They were the most hateful and grumpy people. If you don't like your job that much find another one. There are plenty of people out there looking for work and would gladly take your job and do it with a smile.. Two of the girls just sat at the table while one other employee did all the work. I will never go back and will never let anyone I know go there. Horrible experience. And the food was nasty to top it all off. Took 30 minutes to get our 1 pizza. It was soggy and nasty by the time we got it. Didnt get offered a refill on our beverages until we were done eating and ready to leave.",

Ordered their wings when we received them they were so overcooked you couldn't eat them and they shorted us a fry. We called to speak to a manager and were met with rude staff. Per manager we had to actually come in the next day and bring the wings and receipt in as if we were lying.When i arrived and asked for the manager they told us he would be right out. They lady never went and told him anything for quite awhile. I asked her again and her response was she was so busy she couldnt deal with everything at once. We finally spoke to the manager and asked to have our ordered delivered because my brother in law had placed a seperate order and he had already received his food because i had to wait so long to speak to the manager. Our fix it order took over 2 hours to get to us and the food was cold and disgusting and the calzone was burnt to a crisp. Yes cold burnt food. I will NOT be wasting anymore money at this establishment. Such a shame food quality and customer service just doesn't exist anymore at some of these so called restaurants.",

I purchase a pick up special with two toppings on 12/06/17 for $14.07 when I check my bank account the next day I found out that the transaction did not match what my receipt said. They overcharge me by $8.66 on my debit card for a total of $22.73 if they do this to ten people that's $86.66 I attempted to resolve this issue, with the manager and I was blown off and ignored. That left me no other choice but to call my bank and open up a fraud investigation, on the overcharge. I will never purchase another pizza from this establishment because I have been in this establishment numerous times and I feel this is no way to treat any returning customers, I believe the price of a pick up is around $8.99. So in reality, I got charge for two pizza's, It is up to the customer if they want to leave a almost $9.00 tip for a pick-up. (Who does that anyway?) This place should not be tipping itself with other people's money without the authorization of the customer! This is not a ethical business practice.",

After I arrived home, I noticed my order was missing an item. When I called,  I was asked to go back.  I barely got a \"sorry.\"  Had I not stood there I probably wouldn't have gotten that.  Waste of gas, time and money, it was so flavorless.  It's to bad, when this place was at the top of their game it was the best in the area, unfortunately it's now just a run of the mill pizza joint.

Told me that he couldn't waste a pizza and that it was in the oven. Defended his employee for hanging up on me multiple times, and lacked empathy. Told me there was nothing he could do to stop the order and to cancel via Yelp. Told him that if the service was any indication of the product to not deliver the pizza. Nightmare.

I have spent many nights here with my boyfriend before a movie, or in the late night hours with our friends. It's a good place to go to talk and hang out. Their medium pizza is a great deal and we never feel guilty for dropping a little cash because it's so cheap and delicious.   I must also recommend their fries. We have yet to have better French fries maybe ever.  I also really enjoy the Philly Steak Bomb (with banana peppers).

One thing we are not a fan of is the not so friendly staff. On this particular occasion I had ordered food and had it delivered for my husbands birthday for a very large group of people. You'd think if someone is spending $250 you would at least try to be somewhat pleasant. Fortunately for Napolis their wings are yummy so we will be back.",

Service also gets my highest rating. The lunch specials, I think there are about 24 to choose from are only $7.99. Best quality deal in town. The lunch specials run from  9 AM to 3 PM.",

    "text": "Years before I tried this place I would get flyers from them. I usually tossed the flyers (sorry, but I did). I would stick to the chains as they were cheaper and having had bad experiences with other \"local\" places, I didn't want a repeat.   I was wrong. I admit that.   It was during a #LivePD promotion in April and I decided to tweet for a free pizza. The service that was being used for the promotion chose Napoli and I ended up with a 14\" (small) cheese pizza. It was pretty tasty and I was surprised at the quality. There was plenty of cheese. Napoli didn't skimp.   The next week my mom got a \"free\" pizza. And, again, Napoli was chosen. By this time we were pretty hooked on their pizza.   When I saw they had a 16\", one-topping carryout for $8.99 - I thought it was perfect. And, the next time I wanted pizza, I went in. The service was great, the pizza was great. I've had the pepperoni and an extra cheese pizza. They don't disappoint. Even regular cheese is great.   I love the thin middle part of the crust. Sometimes the pizza is greasy, sometimes it isn't. Yes it can be wimpy. I go for taste. And, the cheese they use is wonderful.   Since April, this has been my standard \"go-to\" pizza and I order at least 3x a month since April.   My mother and I can't eat a whole 16\", so we have to re-heat the pizza - usually the next day after we get it (lunch), and have had it for dinner two (2) nights later. Most would think that's gross to re-heat it, but we have found great success by just warming it up (no more than 350) in the oven. It comes out as good as when we got it, or better. I can't give away all my secrets though.  I have successfully re-heated the same piece twice (same method). And, it was still tasty. It was a bit stiffer, but still just as amazing. Of course this is with an extra cheese, light sauce pizza. That might not work for everyone else though.   The service is pretty good. The seating area is small. I've had their 30\" pizza which I ended up having to freeze, then we defrosted it, warmed it up - and, it wasn't bad at all. It was surprisingly tasty and kept its integrity. But, as I've gotten one of those JUMBO pies, I won't need to get one again. It went quite a few meals though. And, it was a trip to see in my trunk. I only got it because there was a special for it.  The seating area (at this location) is small, but as we get the pizza to go, it's not a big deal. The ice cream is a bit pricey, and so are some items. But, that's to be expected. I only go for the pizza.   Their hours are a bonus! With the hot summer temps (especially when it's been 115 outside) - the late hours are great! Seven days a week 9am-3am.  I'm a satisfied customer. I do wish there was a way to order the special online as having to spell out L-I-G-H-T sauce is a pain. For some reason when I say it, it comes out as WHITE sauce. An app or online method would reduce that.  All in all, I love Napoli and will continue to be a customer as long as they have the 16\" special, treat me right, and I live in the area.",

The pizza served here is the thin pizza style with a pretty fluffy crust. Good thing is that the pizza is not overly oily and it is heavily loaded with lotsa cheeeeeeese!  We also ordered the chicken wings which came in two flavors: buffalo and sweet teriyaki. These wings were actually crispy when they first arrived, but because they are covered in a sauce they quickly became soggy.   To wrap it up, would I order/eat here again in the future? Probably not.",

I made a call to order pizza w wings and fries but man on the phone gave me an attitude and was more concerned on getting my phone number rather than taking my order. By the time I get there, only the fries and wings were given to me. I asked the lady in front that I had placed an order of pizza as well. She was being defensive and saying that I never did. So I told her my pizza order and waited an hour for my pizza. At this point, I was frustrated and impatient with them. After she had given me my pizza she started to become all friendly and offering me if I needed anything else. I was not having it and simply ignored them. Overall, the customer service here needs help and a lot of improvement. But from the looks of it, the staff looks and acts like stuck up snobs. Our pizza came out drowning in grease, wings were too hard like if it was microwaved.  Take my advice; save yourself the time and take your service elsewhere. This place is not worth it. ^^",

She walked away and got three containers of ranch and came back and dropped them on the counter and walked away.  She was the rudest person I've ever experienced in a restaurant.  I've dined in the country where she was born when it was ran be Communist.  The service was better than this place",

Instead of slices of zucchini on the pizza, it was slices of fried zucchini sticks with the breading still on it.  After picking off the breading I was left with a few tiny zucchini cubes, but the fried flavor was all I could taste.  Who puts fried food on top of a pizza??? Yuck !!",

But the third time, we went there we complained to them about the garlic balls wasn't the same as before, they only put lil bit garlic butter and the appetizers came together with the main course at the same time and it was needed for almost 45 minutes to waited those foods, Even only 2 family at that time. The guy seems unhappy and he said we must add $1 for extra sauce, didn't say sorry but only gave a reason that only 1 chef in the kitchen. That's pretty weirdo, they didn't wanna accept complain for their service?!?! Today same guy was there and we ordered same food but he remembered us, never learning, out complain is still the same as before. We don't know how to complain to them anymore. We love the food and the location nearest by our house but the problem the guy seems doesn't like us because we have complained to him.",

    "text": "Ok this review is based on customer service. It's 5:30 on a Wednesday evening. My family wants pizza. So I decide to call Napoli based on yelp reviews.  I called and a woman answered the phone. I wanted to confirm that they deliver to my neighbourhood, she asked for my cross streets and I say warm springs and Pueblo. The lady could not understand the word Pueblo. So I spell it to her and she still could not understand or even say the street name. She asks me if there is another cross street, so I tell her Warmsprings and Lake mead. Ok she understood that. Now for my address. I give her the name of my street and again spell it for her. She says umm can you spell it again slower. So I do. And she spells it back to me WRONG! I say no sorry it's not that. And again I spell it for her so slow that literally I gave her 1 letter per maybe 2 seconds before giving her another letter. AGAIN she can't get  it right!!! So I ask her this time if she understands what I am saying or is there a problem with our phone connection.  She says\" I can hear you, just not understanding\" UNDERSTANDING WHAT!!, you don't understand the alphabet? Because I'm just giving you the letters to my street name and you can't even understand that! No I did not say that , but I seriously thought it. Needless to say, I said never mind and took my business to Boxers Pizza. Very frustrated that Napoli would put someone answering and taking orders over the phone when they are obviously not good at speaking  or understanding English!",

    "text": "Excellent food with tons of options for home delivery.  My family and I just finished up our meal delivered from Napoli's in Henderson, NV.  We ordered the Calzone, Veal Parmigiana Sandwich, and the Linguine Imperiale entree.  I used the online order system so I could take my time selecting and it worked flawlessly.  Top of the order page listed 45 minutes for delivery, and the order was in fact delivered within the 45 minutes.  The food arrived well packaged, hot, and every item correctly prepared.  I ordered the 'small' Calzone, but it was huge - the size of a half a pizza box. The Veal Parmigiana sandwich was hot and moist with tons of melted cheese, although the fries were a bit soggy.  The Linguine Imperiale entree was a bit pricey at $19.99, but the portion was enough for two of us and it came with a small (very small) salad and garlic bread.  The Imperiale was wonderfully creamy with plenty of clams and about 6 shrimp, a very nice amount of pepper - very tasty.  The delivery charge was only $2.50, and the online system provides the ability to leave a tip in the amount of 10%, 15%, or 20%.  I like to leave the tip up front in every home delivery as a bit of an incentive.  As most people, we also love to buy their giant New York style pizza (30\") for special occasions, and we have never been disappointed.",

I will say first off, that do not ever, under any circumstances get delivery from Napoli. As other Yelpers mentioned, it takes FOREVER. We were able to do carry out most of the time because it was near our house. We dined in a couple of times, but it was always a bit awkward because the dining room is right next to the kitchen, there was always staff or family of staff in the dining room, and the TV's were blaring....it also occasional felt as if we were interrupting some Eastern European mob meeting of some sort. Anyway...the pizza was good. Always fresh, quality ingredients and a variety of ingredients. Our staple here was usually the pineapple, ham and onions, but it ranged. The pineapple was canned, but everything else was fresh on that particular pie.  Napoli is a virtual fat kid paradise, because you can get sandwiches, fried chicken and a variety of other dishes here...they also had dessert, but we never tried any of that. Beyond the pizza, we would get salad and occasionally fries.  They are open really late, which is also a plus.",

The pizza is large and obviously made with quality ingredients. My favorite side is the spicy potatoes!!!! I'm drooling just thinking about them! Fairly inexpensive and you get a ton of food. We never get delivery so I can't comment on the delivery times. Their new restaurant is great looking with plenty of tables including an outdoor dining area that might be utilized when weather permits. Staff has always treated us well, in fact my boyfriend and I now rate smiles since we come in so often. Desserts are pretty good, not all are freshly made, but the chocolate torte was awesome and the baklava is too :)",

It's like the staff there can't be bothered. My fiance and I have gone there for about two years now, trying to give them another chance (and because it was really our only option for pizza), but today was the last straw. We went in to pick up the order we called ahead for. Long story short, the lady at the counter was having issues with the card reader, and kept defiantly exclaiming that both of our cards were declined. We kept our cool and suggested maybe something was wrong with the machine. She said, \"No. It's declined. I just ran a credit a couple minutes ago.\" So, she ends up getting the manager... Lo and behold there WAS something wrong with the machine! After all of that- no apology, not even a change of attitude. Instead we got \"Well, it was denied.\" Unless you feel the food would be worth the trouble, stay away!",

We waited a long time for food to come, and when it did start coming, we waited longer in between each item!  Also, it came out in kind of a weird order.  Zeppoles before meatball hero before garlic balls before pizza?  I was so confused.  Our fault for not specifying \"appetizer, meal, dessert,\" I suppose.  I noticed a family who came long after us had food before us!  Anyway, the prices and the zeppoles will keep me coming back and for those reasons you should give it a try too!",

    "text": "We ordered dinner delivery from here last night. After a long weekend something yummy and easy was exactly what we wanted but unfortunately didn't get. Since we were craving lasagna, i searched Yelp for an Italian delivery place and found Napoli's. I followed the yelp link to the menu on their website and under hot specialties with the rest of the dinners found Lasagna. There were two options, 1 for a 1/2 pan and 1 for a full pan...perfect! Loving the convenience of yelp I also decided to place our order through the Eat 24 ordering link listed on this listing. Easy enough. 1.5 hours later the delivery man showed up. (I called at the 55 min mark and was assured that the driver was on his way). Well 40 min after that when he did show up, he brought 1 tiny container of Lasagna (enough for a child's portion) and our Garlic bread. Now starving and super disappointed, I called Napoli's to inquire about where the rest of our lasagna was. She informed me that this option was the only one available and if I wanted something special than I should have called to order. I nicely explained to her that the 1/2 pan lasagna was clearly listed on the menu through the yelp link and she abruptly told me that she has no clue what I'm talking about that menu is wrong. So just to recap, The menu linked in this Yelp page is incorrect and they don't want us to use the Eat 24 app that they've chosen to link as well. Making the best out if the situation, my fam started eating while I was on the phone, sharing the one person serving of lasagna. IT WAS COLD!! Like ice cold and cheese hardened and the garlic bread was as hard as a rock. WHAAt?! I can understand if it takes extra time to cook a lasagna, but an 1.5hrs and rude service for 3 bites of COLD dinner that cost about $25?! Sorry Napoli's, this was just bad all around.",

    "text": "This place probably has too big of a menu, and should cut some items to focus on only doing others. However some of the complaints here are also humorous. For example... I'm not sure why people are ordering Gyro's here when two doors down is probably the top Gyro in the city. That's not what a pizza place is going to specialize in. Go down to the actual greek restaurant in the same shopping center for all things greek. That place rates highly and for good reason.  The lunch special is a fantastic deal. The Pizza is NY style. They do a solid job of it. I can confidently say I enjoyed the pizza, and would return. If you go there for the lunch special pizza you're getting a one topping pizza at 16 inches for $7. You can't beat that price.  I didn't try the pasta. We did have a salad with the meal and enjoyed that as well.",

We go here quit often because the pizza is good and they have great specials, but if it's customer care you looking for.......you defiantly will not find it here! All and I mean all the staff is rude! If you walk in and there is a man at the counter they will not acknowledge you or take your order or nothing they will sit there and talk to each other like you don't exist until one of the young girls finally comes out to help you! Same thing on the phone on a busy night they can put you on hold till you get sick of it and just hang up! So if you want good cheap pizza and don't care about getting it w/o a smile or a thank you, this is your place!",

    "text": "The pizza here is awesome!  The other food is pretty good too, but I'm not a fan of the french fries.  My family orders from Napoli's from time to time because it is so close to them, so I've tried a lot of stuff on the menu.  The pizza is the best, so get that the first time you go.  If you're looking at the rest of the menu, I'd suggest the pastas, especially the tortellini.  The garlic breadsticks are delicious and buttery.  Their side salads are kind of lame, but the Caprese and Caesars are good.      I disagree that the people that work here are mean.  They are always very busy and in a hurry, so they aren't taking the time to smile and ask you how your day is going.  I'm not sure where they are from, but I think they are Eastern European; therefore, they act a little different.  I think Americans are used to the super-friendly attitude of people trying to get you to come back to their business.  But at Napoli's they are all business; it's very in-and-out and I personally like it that way.  FYI, wait times are going to be longer if you don't live close to them...just because you are in Henderson doesn't mean it will be quick.  It can take 20 minutes just to drive from Napoli's to downtown Henderson, plus the cooking time.",

This time, everything was terrible. First off, the girl that took my order was extremely rude. the food was very expensive, and when I got it, everything tasted terrible. My order was as follows. #14- Lasgana for 2, salad, appetizer, 2 liter soda, garlic bread and 2 desserts. The lasagna was mooshy and oily and the meat was pasty. The appetizer(fried ravioli) had no flavor and was cold. My garlic bread wasn't toasted and was mooshy with no flavor.  We called them back to actually get our money back, because there was no way we were going to eat the food. We paid $40 for it, and expected it to at least be edible. Not only are they giving us the run around, but they are being extremely rude to us(said girl that took our order). We are still waiting for the manager to call us back. They told us they can only exchange our food. why would we want to wait another HOUR for food that we might not even want to eat. Overall, this experience was terrible. Save your money, and order from Boxers! Now they're awesome.",

    "text": "I was very happy when I discovered this pizza place. It was the best I've found since moving to Henderson and almost as good as the pizza from my home town near North East Philly. That's the only reason it's getting any stars from me. My last delivery (or non delivery) was a disaster. We ordered at 6pm through the slice app which I've done many times before. We got the confirmation email that it went through and another with an estimated delivery time. It was a Saturday so I was expecting about 1 1/2 hours. When 7:40 rolled around and still no pizza I called to find out the status. The man on the phone said he was sorry, they were super busy and the delivery guy was on his way. 20 minutes later I called back and he said they never got the order. Now I was livid and I called slice to see if they knew what happened. The slice rep called Napoli and when he got back on the phone said the manager told him they lost the order and never contacted anyone to let them know. Now, I have no issue with slice, their customer service has always been great. They said that, because Napoli offered no resolution, they refunded the order and gave me a $10 credit. I was very happy with that. We called Napoli again and they refused to take any blame for the mix up, nor did they offer us any compensation for the trouble. I'm conflicted because, on the one hand, I love their food.... but on the other, I can't support a business with such bad customer service. I own a business and would never treat my customers this way.",

The dining area is bright and clean and more spacious. Before it seemed crowded. They refrigerate the Parmesan cheese which is great. It's not just left out on the tables all day. The whole environment is just so much better. Staff was helpful and welcoming and of course the pizza, chicken tenders and fries are soooo delicious.

And then-One customer went to pay in front of me & so I overheard a conversation between one of the staff and this customer. The customer couldn't understand the employee, and he was trying to give his payment. She was talking down to him that he was taking too long. And then she proceeded to go off on him (while laughing to his face) about how he must be confused or what's wrong with him because he is taking up her time...wow.  Honestly I can't fault the guy at all for not understanding when she asked him for his payment, I couldn't decipher the amount either! He was simply standing there waiting to figure out what she had said (she has a very thick accent with very broken English). But she's young and I guess she thinks she's attractive because she was so rude to him and kept doing this condescending laugh & eye rolling and flipping her hair etc. This chick needs to get over herself.

A little over a year ago, it was great, delivery was always slow but the food was amazing. The best part about Napolis is that they deliver until 3AM and are open inside until 4 or 5am..  In the past 8 months or so, it has been on the decline. I live one street away and it ALWAYS takes well over an hour for delivery. Also the food has been subpar and EVERY order of mine has been wrong or items left out. I have given Napolis a small fortune over the past two years but I can no longer support this business with how bad it has become. Not to mention, it's not the cheapest place.  The last straw: I called Napolis to place and order, I was put on hold as soon as the call went through. I waited 5 minutes, hung up, called back, tried to say wait before being put on hold, they did it instantly again. I waited 3 minutes again, no click over so I hung up. Now I was pissed..... So I chained called them about 6 times, and every time they would answer I couldn't even get a word in before being put on hold.  Never will I order from here again and I would advise the same to anyone else looking for a late night snack, eat some carrots.",

It said no substitutions, but I'm allergic to mushrooms and don't like the peppers so I asked specifically to hold the mushrooms and peppers.  Holding items you can't eat is NOT a substitution.  $ 33 later I got the pizza with mushrooms and peppers.  There is nothing worse than having to dump a pizza in the trash that you waited and paid for.  I checked the order paperwork and the request to hold the items was there, they just decided to ignore it.  Thanks guys, I was a regular customer.",

So on 4/14/18 we ordered pizza, mozzarella sticks, and a 2 liter, it was delivered about 1 hour after we ordered, we found the one pizza was incorrect in the order, and the cheese sticks were over cooked to the point were all of the cheese had melted out of them and we had breaded empty shells and for the second time now, no 2 liter came with our order. I called and spoke to a staff member explained the situation, and he told me we had to return the food and he'd send new food out, I told him it was very late and we would just like a credit for the large order of mozzarella sticks and he 18 inch 2 topping pizza, and the 2nd two liter. He told me \"no problem\" said he would save it under my phone number and I could redeem it any time. So today 4/30/18 I called the Napoli at 1275 W. Warm Springs and wanted to place an order and also redeem the items we were owed. I was placed on a brief hold and spoke with \"Harry\" who was immediately condescending and told me \" sorry it's not in the system and I'd now, we are both pretty good and there's no credit for anything\" I explained the entire situation again and he then told me \" well the night manager is Harry, we are both Named Harry and he wouldn't forget so there no credit here\" I said well then can I order, to which he replied \" look call back tomorrow and talk with him, maybe he forgot and he will remember ok\"? I told him \"no it's not ok, but I'd like to order and redeem the items your store messed up and forgot\", he stated \"sorry there's no credit\" I asked him \"so I can't order any way\" he stated \" No call back tomorrow.\" At which point I said \" No it's cool, I'll never call back\" and hung up. I have never had such incompetent treatment from anywhere here, ever! So I went and reviewed my bank statement to see how much we actually spend each order and how much so far, we averaged 50-70 dollars plus tip on ever order, a minimum of once a month and max of 2 times a month over that last year. A yearly total of about $900.00 we used to spend at Napoli. Most of that was at the other Napoli, only since moving to this side of town have we been eating and ordering from the Napoli located at 1275 W. Warm Springs Rd. I was treated so rude and with the insinuation and disrespect that we will Never eat at or order from this Napoli ever again! Great job Harry for being a rude demeaning \"day manager\". I'm sure Napoli has competition that will treat us better and do well to profit from our orders and our purchases from now on. I will tell everyone I know and come into contact with to avoid this location permanently. I award negative stars if it allowed it.",

The picture they have of the sandwich posted is False advertising at best. Oh!   \"Hey it comes with fries all in one packaged box so the steam keeps your fries nice and wet, let's throw some pickles in there too! Wet pickle fries and a hard roll with a tiny scrap of meat and cheese would really top it off!\"  Again pizza is good but overpriced. Wings and fingers are average and also overpriced.",

The pizza is huge! for a medium and the sauce is very close to perfection as can be, good quality mozzarella cheese that doesn't make you want to drink up all of Lake Mead to quench your thrist afterwards like some other salty cheeses used in lower grade pizza joints. The crust is perfect in my opinion, not too phonebook thick, not too potato chip crust thin. Even the pepperoni is extra good and does not have that purina dog food taste like I have experienced with other pizza chains. I've only tried the pizza here and not anything else, but looking at the menu makes you wonder how they can offer such an extensive line up of Pizza, Italian food items, wings and other bar type fare? Somehow they seem to manage it. Service here is very good and I have not had any issues with the ladies behind the counter. The inside of the restaurant is plain and simple, with plenty of inside seating and even a small outside area that you can dine in. Beer, soft drinks and even a massive 30 inch pizza is offered here. There are big screen TVs on the wall so maybe sunday morning or monday night football games can be enjoyed here? Good tasty pizza and will go out on a limb and say it's got to be right up there in my top three pizza choices in the Las Vegas valley, they got the pizza technique and recipe down. Hot pizza right out of the Napoli oven or cold leftover pizza NOT heated, but taken right out of the fridge the next day, they pass the taste test every time!",

It's good hangover food (from what I've heard), and it hits the spot if you're feeling in the mood for anything greasy, cheesy, and gooey.   The pizzas and burgers are pretty good. If you order burgers, they come with fries, but the fries are pretty forgettable. I do like the italian sodas though.. goes well with the greasiness :)  Delivery times vary.. but I think the quickest time they've delivered was under 30 minutes (for burgers) and up to an hour for pizzas. I've had good experiences with the delivery people as well as the cashiers when I place my order, so no complaints! They take credit card over the phone too which is pretty convenient :)",

The main courses from stuffed shells to veal dishes are absolutely incredible. Fabulous sauces and prepared with very fresh ingredients. They also have a decent amount of wine choices. If you have room.... We have tried every dessert on the menu, ( generally take them home because we are so full), and they are all outstanding. The real supersede is after all of this, the check will not give you a heart attack. We fine the pricing very fair and reasonable. You can also call in and pick up your food to go.

I have gotten many a cold pizza, which is unacceptable when you're the only table in the place.  I don't even know how that happens, unless you forgot about me or you're handing me someone else's crusty pizza that's been sitting around for a while.  Eww.  Sure, it's cheap and huge, but it's also greasy and pretty soggy.  If I eat things that are questionable in the health department, I tend to just pick at them and eat smaller portions.  At Napoli, I actually feel that guilty feeling in the bottom of my stomach when I eat.    If you want to try a local chain that also delivers but has a higher quality product, try Boxer's on Boulder Highway.  The service is friendlier and the food is infinitely better.",

We ordered a simple pepperoni pizza and some garlic balls. The garlic balls were HUGE, and we got a dozen for around $3. The first batch came out burnt so we had to request them to be remade. The second batch came out well, and were pretty good tasting too. The pizza tasted amazing as well, but it was EXTREMELY greasy.

Wings were very average and I'm very picky about a quality wing and first bite was an unusual hunk of gristle and I noticed my wife doing the same with her wing. Overall, loved the pizza and will try agin based on pizza alone but Angelina's for the same order is probably a little better value.",

They have three locations but it's not like a chain they hand toss their pizza . Also called in order with Mila she was very helpful. There was a line but they moved it fast when came to pick up a pizza.",

First timer-had the two slices w any two toppings made fresh (and quick-about 7 min wait total) and a drink for $5.99. Pizza slices are huge and the crust is thin, extremely crispy, and the sauce was wonderful. I got fresh tomatoes and onions and I'd do it again. I noticed they do offer a few vegetarian options and gluten-free crust too. The kind of thin and crispy that's not so heavy on greasy cheese you feel like you're eating a quesadilla... Honestly very good. Service was right on, too. My friend got a blackened chicken salad and well... I'm staring at her empty plate. They're open late and a great spot so I'd say give em a try.",

I got the Lasagna lunch special. The sauce is so watery, the pieces of lasagna are stuck together. The garlic bread that came with it is atrocious. Not even edible Tastes like they smothered the bread in some sort of butter substitute and there wasn't even the slightest garlic taste whatsoever. At least the lasagna wasn't disgusting and I could eat it. One downside to the delivery, the man who delivered it smelled terribly of cigarette smoke which makes me feel really sick to my stomach, so I'm sure that going into eating my food with a sick feeling sure didn't help. Don't waste your time with this place. I sure won't be ordering again!  Edit: I decided to make my 2 star rating a 1 star for this reason: I forgot that I ordered a slice of apple pie with my order... yeah. That is frozen...... I mean like, solidly frozen... Might I emphasize again... Don't even waste your time with this place. Awful!!!!",

The boyfriend and I eat pizza from here religiouslyyyyy. We get it delivered like 3x a week sometimes. All times of the day. Napoli makes ordering easy with grubhub. I recommend ordering the 4 topping pizza. We always get basil, sausages, olives, bell peppers. Greatest combo. I honestly don't know what we would do without Napoli. It takes an hour from the time of ordering to be delivered and we live less than 10min away.

There was us and another couple yet there were 4 other tables that were dirty and still had dishes and food on them and the young lady at the counter was not as nice as the girls that have helped us in the past !!!  The food was still great ... We split a Steak Bomb sandwich and fries!! The sad part was we waited a very long time and then I saw it was brought out of the kitchen and place on the counter where it set for around 6 minutes or so before I went up and grabbed it myself ! There was an older man that came out of the back stuffing his face and completely ignored me when I went to ask him for help!!   The decor on the inside is all new but cheap , you could see some of the molding all ready coming apart and the TVs on the walls were way to High for anyone wanting to watch TV. I miss the older Decor and service and probably will not go back or order from them in the future.",

It was an honest mistake, but they were really trying to convince me that the order they had ready was the one I placed. They were malicious about it, but it did kind of run me the wrong way. Once they looked me up by my number they realized their error and proceeded to fix the second pizza we ordered. I'm not the kind of person who looks for free stuff, but I wasn't even offered a beverage until I decided to buy two 2 liter bottles of soda since I had to wait. Once I added that I was offered a cup of water. To top it all off the pizzas didn't seem like they were 16\" and they were kind of salty. Not bad, but definitely not worth trying again.",

I really debated about coming here because they had some seriously mixed reviews BUT we're in the area of the City of Sin, so why not gamble and I'm so glad we did!!!! Plus most of their bad reviews were about the delivery.  I also went with this place because they stay open extremely late and the other pizza joints didn't stay as open or had a full dining room to enjoy in house.  So this was a perfect choice for us 5 ladies and a puppy LOL.     So we walk in and we try to figure out where to sit.  We grabbed menus and discussed among each other on what shall we order. Five women aren't going to agree on one type of pizza so we had to get 2! We also discussed other things to fill upon :p  So we ordered a medium Cheese and the other half Sausage and pepperoni, the other was  half pepperoni and the other sausage, I was the dbag who wanted cheese only hence 2 pizzas HAHA.  We also doubled the carbs with garlic bread sticks. We also ordered honey bbq chicken wings and caprese salad. Baby sister also wanted fries but they forgot to give them to us and who needed those with all this food o_O     So the service here is AOK. I don't know what part of Europe these folks are from but the young ladies seem to be doing all the front of the house work, they may seem cold but I really think it's their culture and they don't mean any harm.  The food was VERY good. Fresh pizza and not dry at all. The bread sticks were so addicting. I mean even with the pizza, I had to try it and I couldn't stop. Making it easy just to have one slice of pizza, two wings and a bread stick LOL. My sister wanted the caprese salad last minute . This was VERY good. Sadly it was to unique for my sister as it came topped with a tapenade, basil sprinkle  and chunks of olives. This was good for me but for her, she just wants the tomato and cheese with the olive oil drizzle.  I gave her A for effort and trying more than 2 bites. We  LOVED the honey bbq wings.  Moist, big and great sauce! We all thought this was a solid meal.  Oh and their rice pudding was so good and random for a pizza joint.    I can't compare to the other pizza joints in the area but this hit the spot for us. The wings were so good to my family, they came back two days later just for the wings.  So again, sorry that a lot of people got the short end of the stick, but we lucked out and I enjoyed VERY much!",

I ordered the baked ziti previously...the sauce made it terrible.  This time I ordered the eggplant parmigiana sandwich.  The bun was stale and the eggplant was soggy.

We never did receive it and got refunded. Fine.  Tonight we ordered one large veggie pizza and poppers. We were told it'd be delivered in an hour and 10 minutes , and it was. Cold.  Now that I've had a chance to eat their food (after we heated it up a bit) I can honestly say I don't know how they're even in business. This has to be the worst pizza I've ever had. Chewy and slimy crust, zero flavor, probably because there is so little pizza sauce. My toddler took one bite and handed it back. Seriously, if you can't make a 3 year old pizza monster like your product you're doing something wrong.  This meal cost us $42 after tip. We threw it in the trash and made microwave dinners.",

I was intrigued so I went today.  I was there looking over the menu for a few minutes before anyone ever acknowledged I was there.  I guess the fact that the restaurant had very few patrons in it at 12:30 PM on a weekday should have been a sign to me this wasn't going to be a great experience.  The girls were on the phone and talking to each other in some European sounding language (maybe Russian).  Once I was finally asked what I wanted, I was rung up and asked if it was here or to go.  I told her \"to go\".  She then filled up my soda in a glass.  I reminded her it was \"to go\".  She asked \"are you sure?\"  I said \"yes\".  I even checked the receipt to see how she rung me up.  Good thing, too, because I paid her with a $20 and she only gave me change for a $10.  I pointed out that I had given her a $20.  She opened up the cash drawer to check and I guess she saw she had no $10's in the drawer because she then peeled out ten $1 bills and handed them to me.  She told me to drink the soda while I waited for my pizza to cook and she would give me a to go cup.  While I was waiting, she came by and gave me my \"to go\" soda cup.  I thanked her.  When my order was ready, she asked me if I wanted more soda.  By this point, I was ready to leave so I told her \"no thanks\".  As I was leaving, she called me back and asked me if I had only ordered the two slice and soda meal.  I told her \"yes\".  I wasn't sure where this conversation was going at this point.  Maybe trying to make small talk since they seemed rather cold upon initial contact.  The girls were nice enough to look at, but their customer service skills were VERY lacking.  The slices were huge and the amount of toppings were sufficient, although I have had better pizza.  Don't think I'll be going back anytime soon.  Still seeking that one magical pizza place in the Vegas valley that can keep my return business.",

There was a mix-up w/the order I placed w/Grubhub, I cancelled the order almost immediately, because I noticed after placing the order that there was a nearly 200 minute wait.. I ordered at 10:45AM. There was not enough time to even cook the food before I rectified w/Grubhub and over the phone w/Napoli Pizza. Both assured me that my order was confirmed and would be delivered in under an hour. TWO HOURS LATER. My food arrived. Cold, rubbery and WRONG. I asked for Mayo, none and no packet or anything, just cold dry chicken and stale bread and some hour-old provolone. I ordered a side salad w/Caesar and they gave me fries, which at this place is a mixture of curly/regular fries?? This would have been ok, if the order was hot/fresh. The worst part is, I placed my order at 10:45. Someone at my company placed the order at 11:30.. my food showed up w/theirs. So, obviously it sat for AT LEAST an hour, to save them a trip.. even though we BOTH paid separate delivery charges AND a TIP.",

So as I approached him I asked how it's going and he replies with \"you got the money\"? I gave him the cash no comment made. I hand him 50 bucks, he ask if I need change. Mind you my bill is 20 bucks. Yeah mother f**ker I need change!! I ain't tipping you shit after your rude delivery service. If I wasn't a half decent person, that's what would have came out of my mouth.  Took my change and simply walked away with my food.

The pics of the food are VERY misleading, they had to be taken off the internet...or back when they made quality food or something...it certainly doesn't look that way now. Ingredients are completely different even (like the kids Mac and cheese was nacho cheese and thick, cold noodles-the pic is in no way similar to what we received) Everything else I ordered was overcooked and somehow cold. The fries have this very odd, very strong flavor I can't pinpoint.  Don't order delivery.

The pizza was amazing!!! if you like new york style pizza, then this is the place to go! my order only took a little over a half hour. i was pleasantly surprised. the delivery guy seemed sort of quiet and stand off-ish, but im sure it was because my dog was barking at him very loudly. i think he was scared. i will definetely be ordering from here again!",

    "text": "As much as I like this place, tonight's meal was a mess..... I ordered the 16\" take out special and half a bucket of wings. After getting home, I found the pizza crust soggy and under cooked. I called and they replace the pizza with a new one. As it turns out, the crust way too thin and couldn't support the weight of any toppings. While biting into the wings, it turns out that they were under cooked as well. I assume that they have a new cook because I have never experienced any food that poorly prepared there in the 7 years I have been going there. It's a shame that this is happening and I hope it gets fixed. I just know that I will not return any time soon.....",

Lately though the pizza has been stale and for some reason the delivery driver always calls and has asked me to come out to his car and pick up my delivery. Good service has been lacking from this place lately.",

So I decided to give this place a shot and was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the 5 cheese pizza which was very tasty. I also ordered the zucchini sticks. very tasty as well. So far I have ordered from Napolis twice and I have yet to be unsatisfied with the food.  The only downfall and complaint I have is that delivery time can take up to an hour plus. so if you are not in a hurry to get your food then you won't have an issue!  I will continue to order from here. Next time I will try something different!",
