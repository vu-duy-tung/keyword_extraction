    "text": "MTO Cafe has opened its second location at Downtown Summerlin, open from 9:00am-9:00pm daily.  This means that its fans can now have MTO for dinner and that's what four of us did tonight.  I've only ever had breakfast at the original location on Main Street so I've been curious to see what their other menu items are like.  Tonight's choice was the chicken pot pie, comfort food that's apropos for the fall weather.  MTO's version is served piping hot in a skillet with four buttermilk biscuits, shredded chicken, carrots, onions, celery, and leeks: so tasty!  The biscuits serve as the \"crust\" of the dish and it's definitely a hearty meal.  A generous serving, I shared it with the pals and they agreed that it was delicious.   This location differs from the first one in that you order at the counter and seat yourselves.  There's a flatscreen TV, a Coca Cola freestyle soda station, an outdoor patio seating area, a community table inside, as well as comfortable tables and booths.  The booths have convenient electrical outlets in the wall to charge your electronics while you dine and the dining tables have purse hooks, a feature the ladies (and men with murses) will appreciate.  Service was excellent, too.  Open just in time for the holidays, there's no doubt that this MTO will be buzzing with business, gaining more fans along the way.  Glad you're in my 'hood now, MTO--we'll be visiting you often.",

    "text": "I had the Hangover Burger. I'll break it down by ingredient, you'll see why.   I can't comment on the bun since I ordered it without one, but that wouldn't have affected my review. The ingredients are as follows: bacon, fried egg, Tillamook cheddar, special sauce, and fries.  Bacon: great. Cooked perfectly, tasted good. The quality of food I expected from a place like this.   Fried egg: amazing. cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly. If every egg I had for the rest of my life was like this egg I would be happy. I typically order my eggs \"over medium\" and very few people ever get it right. This came out just shy of a perfect over medium (that's what I assume is the standard way, as mine and my wife's were both that way and we didn't specify any particular cooking method when ordering). While it was shy of over medium, it was perfect for a burger.   Tillamook cheddar: great. This is pretty good cheese. Back when I ate cheese by the pound this is what I would get. Good stuff. Hard to mess it up though, as it's a specific brand. I got exactly what I expected from this.  Special sauce: this was basically cole slaw. It was awful. Tasted like more sugar than anything, I immediately removed it all from the burger. Hugely disappointing, and incredibly over-sweet. Was also really runny.  Fries: just absolutely awful. Easily the most disappointing part of this meal. Taste extremely cheap and low quality. Very little salt, very little flavor other than that flavor you get when you know these fries are some cheap crappy bulk freezer section bag that have been reheated and left under a warming lamp for hours. Just awful. Terrible.  Hamburger patty itself: the flavor was only okay, but it is very visually unappealing. Looks like, again, something super cheap from the freezer section of a crappy grocery store. Blatantly pre-pressed and pre-formed. However, I asked for it cooked medium and it was cooked perfectly. Seasoned well, but the meat itself can only be dressed up so much. Both visually and in flavor.  On the plate, there were also two kinds of \"pickles\". Definitely not my style. I tried both styles, expecting a pickle and getting something from the first that tasted more like a super-slightly-pickled cucumber, and from the second that again tasted like a more-pickled-but-covered-in-sugar cucumber. They were both very not good. I was able to eat the first, but I had to immediately spit out the second. Totally gross. I don't understand why the sugar featured so prominently, cucumbers are sweet on their own and pickles are not. These were not a good combination of flavors.  It's kind of sad to write this review, as the burger's flavor combination with the egg and the bacon and cheese really went well together, but the cheapness of the patty and the extremely disappointing fries make me suspect the quality of all the ingredients. The food is all cooked perfectly. Somebody in the kitchen obviously knows exactly what they're doing. The egg and bacon and patty were all expertly executed. What they don't understand is that quality ingredients are important, apparently. I will not be back here any time soon.",

Even though it was crazy busy inside the staff all had smiles and were nice and friendly! That makes a huge difference!   Now let's get to the food! I only got the 5-cheese Mac n cheese due to not being too hungry but oh my lord was it DIVINE. I consider myself a Mac n cheese connoisseur and this was one of the best I've had yet! The favors were delicious! And you could tell all ingredients were fresh! Score! The wife had the Sustainable Salmon omelet and she enjoyed it. On a scale of one to ten she gave it a 10. She too enjoyed the atmosphere and food.  We will definitely be making another stop here in the next few weeks to try some more of the awesome looking menu!",

We ordered the Turkey Melt and the Hero Sandwich. They were very good, I'm not sure which one was better. The bread was soft and crunchy and the portion size was very good. I'm not sure if the value is there though. We end up paying $30 bucks for two sandwiches which seems a bit more than your average cafe. You have the option to change your fries for salad or fruit at an additional price. I guess there is not much of an encouragement to pick healthy options. I got the simple salad and that is exactly what I got, a simple salad. Lettuce, one sun dried tomato and balsamic vinaigrette. The vinaigrette was good, but nothing crazy to it.  I felt the cafe offered a lot more breakfast options than lunch. A lot of the dishes had eggs, which made the selection a little bit more difficult!  Overall, a decent cafe if you want a salad or sandwich.",

    "text": "This review regards a recent visit to MTO. While the menu itself is great and varied, the workers and cooks are substandard. We ordered the creamsicle smoothie, pb and j smoothie, bacon pancake dippers, a huevos rancheros wrap, and a patty melt--totaling $60. The only decent items on that list were the pb and j smoothie and the bacon dippers.   The creamsicle smoothie was watered down. The huevos rancheros wrap was served as a skillet with zero offer to correct the mistake. And the patty melt was inedible. Given the long wait, I had no desire to complain about the meal. However, when one of the workers asked how everything was, I politely voiced my concerns. With an uneaten patty melt sitting in front of her, she meekly said, \"I'm sorry\" and giggled. ZERO offer to correct the inedible food. ZERO offer to provide a refund for the inedible food. That response is why this review is being left. For $60, she should have immediately corrected the matter and not simply offered a lackadaisical apology and walked away. If you're going to ask how something is and then not correct a discovered problem, why even ask?  Needless to say, I will not be returning. Hopefully, a manager reads this and corrects the situation for future guests and the sake of the business.",

Turkey burger - pretty good, no flavor grenade, but if you like turkey burgers, you won't be disappointed by it.   Wings - they advertise a ginger / franks red hot mix. Taste like standard wings , which I like - but nothing special if your looking for something new.  Grilled cheese - was awesome (I stole a bite), sweet, cheesy.

Also a small kids menu that is reasonably priced. We shared the $13 Reuben. It came with a choice of fries or a small salad. My grandchildren shared a grilled cheese sandwich off the kids menu. We chose to have it served with apple slices ( there were five very tiny apple slices - even for a kids menu side dish, this was a small portion) Ambience: it is set up as a fast food Eatery. Very Spartan in the decorating with maybe a dozen tables for 4 and chairs surrounding them. There is very loud music blaring. And with decent size crowd, the noise level is very very loud. They serve the food on real China, a very nice touch considering how informal the restaurant is. Service: the staff we're all very pleasant and seem to be genuinely happy working there. The food was brought out in the appropriate amount of time. A staff member came and cleared the table when we were done eating. Food: the Reuben sandwich was fairly light on the corned beef. I know that there was melted Swiss cheese in the sandwich because I saw it. However there was so little that you could not taste it. There was ample sauerkraut relative to the amount of meat. However , it was put on in such a way that it soaked the bottom piece of bread. Overall, a very disappointing Reuben sandwich. Especially at that price point. The kids got grilled cheese. I got to taste their leftovers. That was actually quite good for a kids grilled cheese sandwich (only $5 - quite reasonable).  Value: for a very informal fast food breakfast and lunch eatery , it was okay. However I feel that he was somewhat pricey for what you get. I won't be going back.",

The mac and cheese is good but they do use a lot of velveeta so the flavors of the other cheeses fade a bit. Definitely will eat here again. Not overpriced and definitely a great stop to eat. Fun drink machine and helpful workers round out a positive experience!",

I finally had a chance while shopping in downtown summerlin, and I am mind blown of how delicious it was!   I had the MTO breakfast and I was not disappointed. It was also A LOT of food, which is always a plus, along with a hazelnut latte, also very delicious. It came with about 4 different kinds of meat, hash browns, eggs and toast, pure deliciousness!   I was absolutely amazed at the hash browns, They had mashed potatoes in them!!! I will most define you be coming back to try the rest of their menu!",

Also, I wasn't feeling well enough for a full meal of something else. They wouldn't let me get chicken fingers. Clearly they don't understand that some adults have health issues and can only eat certain foods and/or smaller portions. My husband ordered a burger and a drink. Totaled $17. I really don't think my $7 overpriced, kids chicken fingers should have been a big deal. I am now waiting for Blue Ribbon to open at 11am so I can go get some chicken fingers. I'm sure they will be glad to take my $7+. At many restaurants, I often order from the kids menu when I am not feeling well. NEVER have I been denied food. I always make sure to order a drink and my husband gets a full priced meal to make up the difference. This place just has bad customer service and I won't be back. It's really unfortunate, because I have enjoyed their food in the past. Oh well. Time for some Blue Ribbon !",

These were the blandest waffles I've ever had. The berries were fresh and the vanilla whip cream wasn't overly sweet which was a good thing. The chicken was cooked nicely but the gravy once again was entirely too bland. Why? If I'm paying 35$ for two orders of waffles they better be good. But what do you expect in downtown Summerlin I suppose. My next complaint is the staff. Between the 3 cashiers that all look as if they hate their job to the busser that sags his pants I'm not sure where to go from here. They have 8-9 staff members working for four tables, I'm also not sure how this business model is working for them but if they continue I'm sure they won't be in business for much longer. At least I hope not considering I don't want other people to also get ripped off. To the owner: Reevaluate.",

Tables were filled, but no line to order. We waited over 50 minutes for our food to come. Then only MY order came out- not my friends. My friend was told hers was coming several times before someone came over and asked her what she ordered- at which point she canceled her order. It was ridiculous. There was a family of 5 sitting near us who also had to cancel their order after waiting just as long without food. Not one person who worked there offered a pastry, anything from the bakery cabinet while several customers (kids included) were hungry and waiting. My friend did ask for some fries- and cold ones were brought to her. The staff did apologize for the mess and even had to close the kitchen- turning away several customers (we witnessed this). Very poorly run. I've never seen anything like it. When they did bring my meal out- no silverware or napkins were brought to accompany it. We had to ask after 10 minutes. I love MTO(the one downtown)  and was utterly disappointed at the Summerlin location.",

I'll have to start off by saying it sucks for MTO (or any business) to have to deal with getting 3 stars or less from people who do not know how restaurants work, oh and the ones who can't cook to save their own lives, oh and definitely the ones who all they know is Chili's and that $6.99 prime rib dinner at the Cannery!! Then they get on sites like Yelp and speak like they know what they are talking about... People! People! .... Stop wasting everyone's time by giving businesses 2 stars because it was too packed and you had to wait longer! What do you want these places to do, something is obviously going right if the place is packed! Or giving them 3 stars because the food was good, but they got your order wrong the first time and that pissed you off but you didn't say anything when that restaurant sends out a free dessert item! You people are annoying, lame, and disgruntled.  Anyway sorry I had to take away from MTO's positives!! The food was great. The atmosphere was great, the options of food were just right (I hate restaurants with a thousand items on it, you know everything on it can't be fresh), and definitely the service I really liked and received from the staff! Chris I believe was his name, but everyone was cool! That KFC dish was definitely permanently programmed on my taste buds!!  MTO needs to open something in the Mountains Edge, or Gramercy area!",

Her attitude was just stupid I can tell she wasn't taught manners or people skills at all.",

We ordered the Greek omelette and the apple cinnamon French toast- absolutely delicious! The French toast was fluffy and the apples were perfectly caramelized- it wasn't too sweet and the cinnamon complemented it perfectly. The omelette was just as amazing- very flavorful and cooked perfectly! Our food came out quickly even though it was busy and we were able to get in and out in just about 40 minutes. Really enjoyed our experience here and surely will be back!",

    "text": "I love the food at MTO - Downtown more than this location. They pretty much have the same menu items but for some reason the execution isn't the same.  Banana Nutella Muffin: I had such great expectations for this muffin that I bought 3 for me, myself and I - we were all disappointed. Me thought it lacked Nutella. Myself added more Nutella on the 2nd muffin. I didn't waste any more time and calories on the 3rd muffin and just tossed it. I mean, if you're going to put key ingredients onto the name of the menu item, those ingredients better exist! You can taste banana but the Nutella was lightly drizzled on top of the muffin - so sad. The muffin itself lacked texture and was very dense and dry. I'm not expecting cupcake...but a muffin should not be like this at all. 1/5  Turkey Melt: Turkey, avocadoes, cheese and tomatoes. Comes with fries and pickles. Nothing crazy, nothing fancy, nothing extremely different, nothing noteworthy. 3/5  What you should definitely try: Hangover Burger, skillets, Fat Elvis and apple rings. Those are good!",

    "text": "I had a meeting today and decided to come here for breakfast. Today, I ordered the tomato basil soup (comes with half a grilled cheese sandwich) and wow... I devoured it. The tomato basil soup was creamy and slightly tangy and I couldn't put down my spoon. Of course, I had to dip my grilled cheese in the soup, which satisfied my taste buds. This meal was exactly what I craved. The place was pretty busy in the morning since most stores aren't open till around 11am. From the moment I came in until I left, the customer service was great. The cashier greeted me and made sure I wasn't pressured about ordering fast (they have a big menu that takes a minute to choose from). I think while I was there, the waitress asked me about 3 times how the food was, if I needed anything, or to take any plates out of the way. This is the customer service that every restaurant needs.   However, the only thing I didn't enjoy was the cost. My tomato basil soup cost $7 for a bowl that wasn't really big. I would expect more for spending almost $10 on soup. I don't know if I'd come back on a weekly basis, but it's a good place to eat at Downtown Summerlin in the morning.   Also, don't forget to check in so you can redeem yourself a free chocolate chip cookie!",

    "text": "Came for lunch at the MTO Cafe on a Monday afternoon (MLK day) and it was extremely busy.  That was okay with me because you counter order, then get a number so your food can be brought to you.  The long line gave me a chance to peruse the paper menu before I could read the menu board at the counter.  They have both indoor and outdoor seating, but the outside tables were in the shade at that time, so I was glad a table opened up inside when we were ready to sit down.  It was a nice day, but a little chilly walking around Downtown Summerlin, so it felt like a soup and sandwich day to us.  When we got to the counter, we were told that, while the menu includes both cup and bowls of soup, they did not have cups available.  Okay...so we ordered bowls.  This was definitely not a cheap lunch.  2 orders of soup, sandwiches, and sodas was $50.    I ordered the tomato basil soup, which was hot, rich, and hearty.  It says it comes with \"cheddar toast\", which I assumed was like a crustini, but it was actually a sliver of regular grilled cheese...and it was really good.  The soup and \"toast\" was a meal, I didn't need anything else.  But on to my sandwich.  I ordered the Grilled Cheese.  Unlike the kind that came with my soup, this one consisted of brie, honey, & toasted walnuts on brioche.  I was trying something outside the box for me, but I'm not sure why I thought I would like this.  I really think this sandwich will appeal to a lot of people, but it's just not for me.  However, the side salad that came with the sandwich was Amazing.  Baby greens, roasted peppers, a fantastic balsamic.  Yum.   The BF ordered the calm chowder and he said it was one of the best he's had in Vegas.  Both for flavor and the mass amount of actual clams in the dish.  This chowder was enough for a meal, but he has also ordered the Hero sandwich.  It has grilled chicken, prosciutto, salami, and a mix that looked just like my salad.  He took most of it home, but said it was terrific.  All in all, we enjoyed the fresh space, the food, the Freestyle Coke machine, and we will be back sometime when we take the 40 mile journey to Downtown Summerlin.",

Trendy little cafe, with a modern look. Not a place I would take a date for a quiet fashionable meal. Not a whole lot of ambiance here.  I ordered the Fat Elvis, which is french toast filled with peanut butter, banana, and bacon. Topped with lots of fresh fruit. It was very tasty and I enjoyed it. They have tropical ice tea and regular ice tea available, as well as your normal soft drinks from the fancy multiple flavor coke machine.   The nice girl who took the order was very friendly, and helpful. She made a few recommendations and explained a little bit about how the process works where you order up front, get a number, and have a seat. Food came out fast. Very pleasant people working here.   I'll be back to sample other menu items. Its clean, friendly, and not too expensive.",

I stopped for lunch yesterday after some shopping and I'm glad to report it's as good as I had expected.  I was greeted by the staff at the counter in a very friendly manner.  I was studying the large menu board above and two of the staff pointed to some smaller paper menus at the register.  I brought one of those home with me.  I selected the \"Philly\" their take on the classic sandwich.  You're given a number to put on your table.  The menu describes it this way.  \"Skirt steak, Velveeta, red wine drunken onions.\"  The sandwich comes with fries.  I ordered a Coke and I was given a cup for use at their Coca-Cola Freestyle machine.  Silverware (real metal--not plastic) is available at the end of the counter by the registers and there are napkins, straws, and drink container opts there, too.  I selected a table by the east windows that overlooks the Dining Arroyo.  There's a patio there with heaters and some people were sitting out enjoying their lunches.  In a short time, my lunch was brought.  The Philly is on a hamburger style bun instead of the traditional sub-like roll and there was a good amount of fries with the Philly.    The small cubes of steak with the cheese and onions were excellent!  The fries were hot and very good.    After finishing while I was just answering some emails, a staff member came by and asked if she could remove the plate.  That gave me some work room on the table.  There is free wi-fi.  I can't wait to go back and try some more things on the menu.  Welcome to the neighborhaood, MTO!",

    "text": "Have heard great things about their original location, but Downtown Summerlin is far more convenient for me- decor is on the hipster side with birds, natural wood, and far too many chairs around any given table. Also, apparently ketchup is frowned upon? More on this later.  Menu has several breakfast choices, of which I am not a fan. The soups and salads are all solid, but the sandwiches are hit or miss- please note that the Philly comes with Velveeta, which will put off many people (myself included). The Hero is delectable and a generous portion, too. The same can be said for the sea salt fries it is served with- the kitchen is a bit heavy-handed with the salt flakes, and despite the presence of Cholula at the condiment bar, I had to ask staff for ketchup. Who had to ask the chef to bring out a ramekin from the kitchen. For KETCHUP. At a place that serves FRIES. Found this incredibly odd and awkward.  The 5 cheese macaroni is one of the best I've had with a good, thick roux and curly cavatappi noodles. However, for a $7 side it's practically an entree it's so rich. Recommend cutting the portion and price to make it a side, and maybe offering an additional $9 portion as an entree, perhaps with a protein.",

We're giving all of the restaurants in the new mall a try, and so far by far this Cafe is #1 by far compared to my previous dining. This guy in a zebra shirt recommended the chicken in a waffle and their hangover burger. Both were fantastic. Later he came back and talked to us and we found out the nice guy was a manager....I'm coming back for that zebra shirt btw haha. He was very friendly, the register girl was very friendly, and the atmosphere was friendly. Will definitely try again after my tour of the mall.",

I wish the girl taking our order would have informed us on the size of the salad especially considering that my girls are 9 and 11 years old.  One salad would have fed all three of us because they are HUGE.  The three salads cost me about $50 (including 3 drinks) which was a little hefty I thought.  The dressing tasted like bottled caesar salad dressing.  Nothing fancy.  The service was fast and friendly but the food was just okay.",

I ordered the MTO breakfast.  I ordered scrambled eggs but was brought over-easy. No big deal. It was corrected and brought back.   The coffee was warm but far from hot. Diana said that she made the coffee when she first came in. Ya I could tell. The next cup was much better.   As for the food, it was pretty good. My wife had the broccoli omelet and said that it was incredible!!  My MTO breakfast was pretty good.   I would definitely comeback but have something different next time.   My advice to Diana would be to give your employees a little more freedom to answer questions that are directed to them. They are friendly and intelligent. Remember, there is a reason that you hired them.",

Was supposed to be on sourdough bread but just looked like regular toast to me. Turkey was sliced very thin and just tasted like processed turkey you buy from Oscar Mayer or something. Topped with wafer this slice of tomato and ugh.... Shredded iceberg lettuce. What is this a Big Mac? Did not smell appetizing in the least. Someone brought it to my table, dropped it without so much as a word and took off. Three stars for this is generous I tell you.   $17.40 for a not so good turkey sandwich and a coke. This includes a 15% tips that is put upon you when you pay, the option of tipping on the electronic screen. Why are we tipping order takers? Tipping is for people who the IRS takes taxes from in advance for estimated and expected tips. This is not the case with cashiers or cooks. Such is reserved for waiters and waitresses, taxi drivers, etc., who often receive below minimum wage pay and have to pay tax on anticipated tips whether they receive them or not.",

It would have been much better had the sandwich not been served open faced. Putting the sandwich together was messy and because the plates have no rims/lips, the egg yolk leaked off the plate and onto the table.  My only other complaint would be to have more than one bathroom. With such a busy location, lining up to the bathroom was annoying.  No complaints on the food itself and although it is a little pricey the serving sizes are quite decent.  I would definitely come back and recommend this place to people.",

Ordering and payment is done at the counter and you are given a number to be placed on the table. Our order was taken by a friendly staff member and the food is delivered to the table. Refreshment are unlimited and self serve. Upon our arrival for lunch only one person was ahead of us but after sitting down the line grew to six people. Food preparation is not fast delivery food but made to order. After our food was delivered a staff member returned to check on our satisfaction.   Th Rueben sandwich was an ample size and comes with pickles on the side and skinny fries. The sandwich was juicy and tender. The special sauce is fantastic. A nice rye bread complements the sandwich. The BLT sandwich was huge. Very tasty and half was taken home. This sandwich also comes with skinny fries that are soft inside, firm outside and not greasy. MTO serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. The menu has many choices that we look forward to experiencing on future visits.",

We gave this location a third chance and they still failed miserably. 1st- hair in food. 2nd- waiting for almost an hour to get food...we never did end up getting it and we got our money back. 3rd- same as 2nd time but when my wife asked the worker what is going on he didn't seem to care.

Food was awesome,  waffles were fluffy, and the mto breakfast was cooked excellent. The best thing here: MASHED HASH BROWNS absolutely something to start your day eating a hybrid of chive mashed potatoes and crispy hash browns.

The portions are huge so 2 people could actually share one meal. We took a to go box that was pretty full home. It was pretty busy and the service was very good. I would definitely go again!",

I mean literally I drank hot water with a coffee color. No amount of cream and sugar can fix this.   Nonetheless, I waited patiently for my Made To Order chicken breakfast tacos.  Chicken, egg, red and green peppers, onions, a hint of queso on corn tortillas (x3) with red and green sauce. The chicken was dry and bland. The eggs appear to have been browned as an omelette then chopped to fill the tacos. The peppers gave it a mild kick. The salsas didn't help much either. The salsa added a little acidity but no heat.  I'd like to say the service made it all worth it, but this day the front counter was staffed by two young kids who seemed flustered and disorganized. To their credit, they tried really hard.  I don't see a reason to come back again. There are other options in Downtown Summerlin with a similar concept that do a better job providing a great dining experience.",

After browsing the menu trying to decide on breakfast or lunch items, I decided on that would satisfy both cravings. The BLTAE won the battle.  Thick grilled white bread served open face and slathered with mayo and topped with shredded iceberg, Roma tomatos, thick cut Applewood bacon and two perfectly cooked Sunnyside up eggs.  This item is located in the sandwich section but this job requires a knife a fork. Great menu item and very satisfying.  Shoestring fries served on side were also very good.  If I would change one thing about this dish it would be the lettuce. Maybe serve with piece of iceberg or step up to romaine or spring mix. Either would work.  We also had the Lemon Poppy seed pancakes with ginger blueberry compote. Yumm!.  I loved the tartness of the lemon throughout the pancakes. Balanced out by the sweetness of the blueberry topping. Another great dish.   Overall good visit. Next time we hope to enjoy the patio.",

The menu was the same but when delivered the food look extravagant which I liked! The restaurant just had a different feel compared to the other one. Which I could appreciate and like. Plus it provided me with an amazing picture of my meal!    Okie. But here is the reason this is a one star review I had a beautiful B.L.T.A.E and it was yummy and little hard to eat but yummy! As I took a bite there was a bread tag in my sandwich. I thought it was maybe a hard piece of bacon so I chewed very hard and even tried to swallow it. I was with friends and I didn't wanna embarrass myself but after a while I couldn't and ended up spitting it out. Thank god I did! I mean a bread tag (pictures will be provide just in case). The upsetting thing is when I showed it to the staff they said and did nothing about it. They just said we will be careful with the other meals prepared .....ok......",

Their motto is simple...fresh comfort food. Their known for their Hangover Burger (its okay), the Kentucky Fried Chicken (Yum), and their Chicken Pot Pie (never tried).  I recommend the MTO Breakfast for $14.99 if you're undecided.  It's my favorite and includes 3 eggs, chicken sausage, turkey bacon, real bacon (the good stuff), spam, potatoes, and your choice of bread.  When I get bored with this meal, I'll substitute the whole eggs with egg whites or pancakes instead of bread.  They can do that here because the food is MTO aka \"made to order\".  The rest of the items on their menu is good too, except the steak.  The best deal at MTO has to be their free cookie if you Check-In to Yelp. MTO is a safe bet whenever I'm hungry, craving eggs, and in Downtown Summerlin.    2017 Yelp Review #58",

Sorry honey, but I have better things to do than steal an applesauce from your mediocre restaurant. The breakfasts looked huge and delish - maybe if we had chosen different food, I would be happier with my experience. But between the overpriced lunch, the rude cashier and the greasy grilled cheese, I'll probably pass on MTO next time. =(",

They gave us our food without the grilled cheese, and to everyone's great surprise.... Our food was cold. Terrible time management. We used to come here a lot, but they've definitely lost a loyal customer. Especially because one of the workers apologized to a family for their food taking a while (way less than us) and gave them a plate of cookies for free!

I understand needing the table, but they couldn't wait the 30 second for us to leave. The food is incredibly bland, and I ordered chorizo, an item that is typically full of flavor. My husband ordered chicken and waffles, the country gravy tasted like flour. My mom had the avocado omelet. The avocado was still hard since it wasn't ripe enough. My sister ordered an omelet that came with a side salad. That \"salad\" consisted of no more than 7 leaves and no dressing (see photos). I literally laughed. It looked like an incomplete garnish.

My boyfriend and I arrived at 1pm on a Saturday and found sitting no problem (luckily spaces were available after we ordered). They serve breakfast all day and that's what we both opted for.  I was craving pancakes but I can't fathom spending $14 on speciality pancakes with no sides included. Instead I ordered a veggie skillet with no mushrooms for $11 (I think) and my boyfriend got the MTO breakfast (meat and hash browns, which MTO calls mash browns) for $14. We both got iced coffees for $3 each.   The food looked delicious and it was tasty! Their spam (part of the MTO breakfast) was cooked to perfection.  There was plenty of food to share. Their mashbrowns are a little soft (but I prefer crispier hash browns). I enjoyed my veggie skillet. I wish the potatoes were softer but that didn't stop me from eating everything!  Looking at the other food people ordered, their pancakes looked aesthetically pleasing and their sandwich bread looked buttered and toasted to make a perfect crunch. Next time I return I might opt for a sandwich!  My boyfriend and I left content and full. MTO Cafe is a nice brunch spot (there is no alcohol options here, so might not be ideal for everyone!) without leaving a guilty feeling inside your stomach.",

    "text": "I'm a fan of MTO's Downtown location and the Downtown Summerlin spin off doesn't disappoint either. Their version of Kentucky fried chicken ($13) is similar in name only to the fast food spot with the same name. The chicken here has a thick, well seasoned crust that virtually cracks open. With two eggs over easy, mash browns, and country gravy, this is one of the better breakfast dishes around. Other breakfast dishes are well crafted, like the chorizo skillet and you can't go wrong with the bacon dippers --strips of bacon covered in pancake batter.  The juicy patty and the salty and sharp blue cheese in the black and bleu burger ($13) make a for a great combo. But, you'll need plenty of napkins while eating it. Save some of those napkins for the chicken in a waffle ($13) too. Covered in country gravy along with maple syrup it can be messy but delicious. Their version of chicken pot pie ($15) uses biscuits instead of a typical pastry crust topping, but flavors come through, just the same. It's creamy and packed with pulled chicken, although it could have benefitted from more vegetables.  They've also got a kid's menu with chicken fingers, waffles, and grilled cheese sandwiches. For fast-casual comfort food with a modern twist, they've got all the bases covered for the whole family any time of day.",

Who runs out of syrup at a breakfast joint that advertises pancakes, waffles and French toast?  On a weekend no less.  You can't send a staff member to Albertsons to buy some syrup?  Horrible management skills if you can't pivot in a panic??  I guess since they are out of syrup now, eggs will be next since everyone is forced to give up their carb habits.....",

    "text": "I have been to MTO on several occasions and I can honestly so it is a hit and miss. Sometimes the food is good and sometimes it is just ok.  I have read a lot about how good MTO's lemon poppy seed pancakes are and I will say they did not live up to their hype. I could not taste any lemon. They just tasted like plain pancakes (like boring ones without buttermilk) with poppy seeds sprinkled in the batter. The blueberry syrup was good but I could hardly taste the ginger. The pancakes were also really chewy to the point where I could not cut them with the side of my fork and had a difficult time cutting it with the butter knife they gave me. I would not order these again.  My husband had the spicy chicken sandwich and he liked it this time. We have gotten it before and it had little to no flavor (hmm shocker there!). From my experience, the sandwiches are usually good here.  The staff is always friendly. The greet you promptly as you enter the restaurant and are quick to answer any questions and offer suggestions. But be warned, this is not a quick service restaurant though it may look like one. It does take a while to get your food because everything seems to be made to order. Overall, MTO is a hit or miss restaurant. Don't expect the same quality or flavor everytime you come back. It is a good restaurant to come to if you and your party can't decide on a breakfast or lunch place and happen to be in the area.",

    "text": "Definitely a fan of MTO Cafe at Downtown Summerlin! My husband and I stopped in for brunch today for the first time. I really liked it - I thought the food was delicious and I really like that it's walk up rather than table service. It's nice if you're not feeling like cooking breakfast at home, but you also don't want to wait for service all morning on a busy Sunday at a restaurant.   We ordered the waffle with seasonal berries and vanilla whipped cream. The waffle was perfect, with fresh strawberries and blueberries, and I loved their house-made whipped cream! My husband had the tri-tip with eggs and their \"hash mash\", which is hash browns with mashed potatoes in the middle, and yes, it's absolutely as delicious as it sounds. He thought it was good but thought the portion was small for the price. I sneaked a few bites and thought it was super tasty! Apparently they used to use a dry espresso rub for the tri-tip but they don't anymore - kind of a bummer, would have loved to try that! Last note, the coffee was good which always makes or breaks a good spot for me. We had a good experience here this morning and will definitely be back!  Tip: when you pay for your meal, have your receipt sent to your phone. I think it's every five times you pay, you get a coupon for 50% off your next meal. Love that!",

    "text": "Okay for the price. I got the hen house which is basically a chicken cesar wrap. It was $11 and came with a giant bowl of fries. The wrap was on the smaller side so I feel like I paid more for the fries than the wrap. Both were good but not that impressive. I wanted to try the chicken pot pie but I wasnt hungry enough. Maybe next time!  Service was fair when I did have to encounter the staff. After placing our orders, we headed outside to wait for our food. Our table had about 5 order numbers which I understand is quite a bit for one group but the server got mixed up a few times. He grabbed wrong numbers to take back after serving certain items. This caused mishaps and somehow they forgot about an order completely. My friend had to go back inside and ask what was going on. They said they were working on it but he didn't get his food until we were all pretty much done with everything. This was odd since another friend ordered the same exact thing!  At the end of my meal, I went back inside to ask for a box to take home leftovers. I stood at the counter for a good 5 minutes before someone finally realized I was there. I can't imagine how annoyed I would be if I was walking  in for the first time and waiting to order something! A manager came up to apologize but they could definitely work on being more attentive to the counter.",

The menu was fairly limited, but I settled on the Hangover Burger and ordered the BLTAE for my little guy. I about choked when she told me my total.. I could have been served and paid much less. I guess they use better ingredients, but you really can't tell in the final product.  Our food came out promptly, and I was expecting greatness. The burger was smothered in some sort of sauce - maybe thousand island and iceberg lettuce. The whole entire time I was eating this concoction I was thinking of Smashburger's Sin City burger, which is about half the cost and 1000 times more tasty.   There is no reason to ever return. There are plenty of other options in DS. Skip this one!",

    "text": "Stating from the day it was announced that I felt MTO Cafe was the most relevant restaurant on the list of eateries at Downtown Summerlin it is with some shame that it took so long to visit after the store's opening, but having enjoyed Chef Johnny Church's breakfast creations at the Downtown location several months prior I'm happy to report the dinner selections in the shadow of Red Rock are just as well done.  Eschewing traditional tableside service and instead implementing a system similar to that of Panera, where guests order and pay at a counter before waiting briefly at their table for Made-to-Order creations, it was with a specially requested tasting menu that my experience at MTO Downtown Summerlin took place and leaving selections to Midwestern Chef's discretion the plates presented frequently took me back to my childhood - memories of roadtrips espoused by some things while upgrades on traditional comfort foods were found in several more.  Beginning with flavored waters from the restaurant's FreeStyle machine - the Peach Dasani particularly lovely, round one began with a sharable tray of Mediterranean dips as well as salads and while the tabbouleh was not particularly my style all three of the dips were absolutely top notch, the smoke-imbued eggplant amongst the best I've ever tasted while edamame added a crisp, vegetal tinge to hummus atop piping hot pita.  Conserving capacity to maximize the experience, round two consisted of three soups served in espresso-style shooters and although the clam chowder may have benefitted from just a touch more brine the cream-style tomato and heavily cheese-topped French onion were both reference standard, a similar compliment applicable to the KFC Breakfast, a juicy breast of chicken beneath herb tinged double-crisp batter atop a pile of pan-seared mashed potatoes all beneath a veil of country gravy and an over easy egg.  A bit leery of rumors that the Chicken Pot Pie was substandard as the biscuit-topped version represents a favorite for myself and pretty much everyone outside of Dutch Amish Country (and those who consider Swanson or Banquet to be quality cuisine) I'm more than pleased to say that the version served by Church and Co. is something many Southern Grandmas would be proud to call their own and with both the stock and chicken teaming with herbs while the carrots offered sweet balance an equally deft plate was executed in the case of Meatloaf that opts not so hit diners with a sledgehammer of False flavors from truffle oil, but rather to dig deeper and provide an aromatic topnote to tender veal beneath flavors both smoky and sweet alongside tender orange gnocchi.  At this point admittedly getting a bit full it was thankfully a downsized portion of the vegan spaghetti squash that arrived and again focusing on nuance, with the sweetness of grapes and carrots used to offset the earthy flavors of beets and curry, one would be hard pressed to find any fault in a plate adhering to such dietary standards - the side-dish of fresh sprouts perfectly cooked, though a bit too spicy from horseradish for this diner's tongue.  Not particularly focused on plated desserts, but instead offering fresh-baked cookies and several pastries available throughout the day, it was with two boxes of goods that I took my leave after a long chat with the Chef and his team and indulging in some after the walk home with others saved for the following morning it was somewhat disappointing to find the poppyseed muffin almost inedibly dry, though the rest was just as good as the majority of the savories - both the brownie and almond pecan scone particularly memorable with soft texture and bold flavors while each of the cookies were far better than those offered at Wonderland Bakery...at less than one-half the cost.  Admittedly a bit pricey for a 'quick casual' place, yet at the same time far friendlier in service with both produce and proteins sourced from local sources as Chef Church is a regular at the local farmers markets, MTO Cafe is precisely what Downtown Summerlin visitors should support - a local business committed to doing things right, not another offshoot from elsewhere willing to mail it in and make bank.",

    "text": "This is one of the new locations in the Downtown Summerlin Mall. Excellent location and beautifully modeled.   This place seems to be very busy, which is excellent for them. When you walk in, it's an order and seat yourself type of joint. #1 reason why I will tell you this place is overpriced.  Also overpriced because it's off the strip. You would expect these kind of prices on there, but not for the regulars in town that's far enough from the strip.  Another thing I'm not much of a fan of, they have shared seating here. Which is okay for some places, but a place like this? Probably not. It's so small in here as it is. People tend to take odd chairs and leave room for 1 person when if they could have scooted down just one, it'd make so much more room for parties over 2 people. It's too hard to leave easy things up to people because they'll fuck it up every time.   The food here is good. I will say that and that is was pretty quick.  Overall, just for a lunch with 2 drinks costed us $41.00 plus tip. That's a little much in my opinion. For the location, the food and the fact that you serve yourself, seat yourself and they have a tip on the receipt is just asking a lot of people.   We had -  The Hangover Burger Grilled Cheese Clam Chowder  Clam Chowder: Delicious. Some of the best we've had in town. Full of clams, good sauce that's not so creamy that you have to force it down. Grilled Cheese: I was not a fan at all. I probably should have read the description better because I couldn't even eat it. It was just such a bizarre combination of flavors and I do not ever NOT finish my dish. The cheese is not melted, it's half walnuts and the bread is toasted with honey. It was so sweet and odd.  The Hangover Burger: Delicious. The flavors were all meshed in an tasted excellent. The bacon was nice and crispy and the flavor of the beef was very flavorful. It was very messy, but very well worth it. Oh, and those fries...FREAKING amazing!  The customer service was fine, I just don't know if I'm okay paying a tip when it's not sit down service. But, some people don't agree with this.   Overall, it's a nice location, modernly decorated, nice people, good food and excellent for a quick hot meal. Just be expecting to pay prices for sit down service.",

    "text": "MTO Cafe is the hot off the press restaurant that recently opened its doors in Las Vegas's hot new shopping destination: Downtown Summerlin. After hanging out in Sabalatte, my brother and I decided to drive to Downtown Summerlin to experience MTO Cafe.     MTO Cafe is in the northern reaches of Downtown Summerlin. Two sides of the cafe give the gift of interesting views of the Downtown. The east-facing windows overlook the pocket park known as the Arroyo. The south-facing windows overlook Park Centre Drive. In daylight the Arroyo-facing seats are the prime seats. At nighttime, the Park Centre Drive-facing seats are the prime seats. From this angle the changing colors of the landmark office building put you in the heart of downtown Summerlin.   The Daniel. S-pectation:      I expected to pay a higher price than I normally would off the Strip. I expected a full service restaurant.   The Daniel. S Report of his MTO Cafe experience:      My brother and I walked into a restaurant that is more similar to Five Guys (also in Downtown Summerlin). You order and pay for your food. The cashier gives you a number to place on your table with a plastic beverage cup. When the food is ready, they bring it to your table. On the way to the table is a freestyle Coke machine with over 100 flavors to choose from.     When we walked inside, a friendly cashier greeted us. I was still undecided. The deal is there is only one burger to choose from. It is their Hangover Burger. Hmm! Should I order the burger or the ruben. The Hangover Burger includes an 8 ounce triple angus with bacon, fried egg, Tillamook cheddar, lettuce, special sauce and fries on the side ($13). I was so not up to a fried egg with the burger. \"Could I order mushrooms in place of the fried egg?,\" I asked the friendly cashier. She communicated this with her supervisor (believe he is the owner). The answer was, \"yes.\" My brother wasn't really gung-ho over a fried egg over the burger. They likewise bestowed his request.      The delay time between ordering and seeing the food was short and enjoyable. My eyes took in the nighttime streetscape of Downtown Summerlin with the changing colors of the landmark office building. Looking up my eyes saw the game playing on the TV Between conversations with my brother, my ears took in the dance mixes featuring the late Michael Jackson.     When they placed the food on the table, I did the Yelper ceremony of photographing my food. This picture shows a patty with a lot of lettuce alongside skinny fries with a cow dispenser in the background. The picture failed to capture the juicy angus beef, mushrooms, Tillamook cheddar cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. My sense of taste appreciated the flavorful burger where it was indifferent to the ordinary skinny fries.     My brother wasn't the only friendly person in my company. The friendly staff would consistently checkup on us. The Manager or Owner also checked up on us. Kudos to the flavorful customer service at MTO Cafe.     MTO Cafe is in a downtown that appears to shutdown between 9 and 10 pm on a Saturday night in the Holidays season. My brother and I were here up to the time that that they closed at 9 pm.   The Daniel. S  No-Spin Zone:      I walked away from my MTO Experience giving it a grade if 80% (3 stars). Here are my constructive criticism points. The price is to high for what you get. The Hangover Burger with fries is $13. You can make an argument on the quality of the angus beef. Taste wise it failed to exceed Smash Burger, Five Guys, and many of the establishments competing for the Burger dollar. With my $13 Hangover Burger, I ordered a beverage that brought the bill to $17.30. The difference brings a plastic cup of Coke to near $4. Just a little overpriced. For $17.30, there are far better deals than a restaurant that isn't truly full service. Diner at New York Chinese Restaurant is $6 less. A soup, sandwich, and beverage at Cafe Zupas is $6.30 less. The seafood combo at L&L Barbecue is approximately $4.50 less. I could go on and on. Another constructive criticism talking point is that the one burger they offer should be a selection of toppings that the customer chooses. A fried egg on the burger is unappealing for far too many taste buds.  The Exit:    I returned to the nighttime sidewalks of Downtown Summerlin with a positive impression of MTO Cafe's customer service, views of Downtown Summerlin, and Hangover Burger. At the same time I had a feeling that MTO Cafe might be a rare experience. From my experiences shared in reviews, $17.30 pays for more rewarding dining experiences.",

The salad was so tart, the sandwich was extremely dry all together, chicken was dry, dressing on it made it sour, one piece of salami and one capicola not even enough to taste it at all. I ate a few smalls bites trying to get through it but couldn't. We also got chicken and waffles, waffles were ok not the best and the chicken was dry beyond belief! I'll never come back again!",

They're incredibly moist and the agave nectar and pecans added on top just make life better. For $11, you get three huge flapjacks. I'd recommend splitting this heavy breakfast with another person unless you're the hulk or something.    For lunch, I wasn't as impressed. There's one vegan option - the falafel wrap. It was a little on the dry side and the french fries might as well have been made out of cardboard. The fries had zero flavor and were all crunch.   Overall, MTO excels as a breakfast spot but could improve it's lunch game.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2017: #8",

I've had coffee and my little one had Mac and cheese, he didn't like it (but it was super yummy, it's not them - it's him ;)). They were great about returning the dish and getting chicken fingers instead, which he loved. Other than that coffee was alright and although the menu selection is ok, nothing was too exciting for me that made me feel  I've had to try it out.  So overall nice fountain view, great spot to sit outside if the weather allows so and generally a four star for me.",

I looked a little more and saw that she was wearing slip on heals too! What kind of business allows their employees to wear that type of \"uniform\" and still allow themselves to be called a family restaurant? On top of all that her hair was down and not put up or in a hat at all like the rest of the staff. I've worked in the food industry long ago but I still remember that you're suspose to keep your hair AWAY FROM THE FOOD! Needless to say I did not chose to stay and eat. If the employees are this disheveled while working I can't think what the service would be like. NEVER bringing my family here ever unless a change is mad and quick.",

    "text": "We came in on MLK Jr. Day and experienced very slow service from kitchen to table...we were told that two chefs called out on this National Holiday... but what makes MTO Cafe 4 stars?...the quality of the food and friendliness of the staff.  After yoga, we had to eat something before our next class in a day that we opted for a double...so my love and I stopped in to MTO Cafe around 3:30 in the afternoon.  Not many tables were occupied and the overall setting was clean. We were greeted with a warm smile, and proceeded to order a Quinoa Crunch Salad and a Vegan Falafel Wrap.     We helped ourselves to glasses of water from the self-service soft drink station and waited...watied...and waited a little more. I could sense the frustration from the other patrons who ordered before us wondering where the food was. The server kindly went around to apologize for the delay and discretely explained to us that they were short on kitchen staff at that moment. So, it took much longer to get orders ready, but once we had our food...the result was a couple of happy campers on our end.  The Quinoa Crunch Salad came with quinoa, broccoli, zucchini, avocado, arugula, edamame hummus, chipotle vinaigrette, and hot sauce at $9...simple and fresh ingredients with light dressing. The Vegan Flafel was made with chick peas, tomato, lettus, onion, balsamic tahini on unleavened bread with a simple green salad...this one was so delicious that if we weren't sharing, I could have eaten it all. The falafel was still warm, and wrapped-up compact with all so much deliciousness to make me forget how long we had to wait....the balsamic tahini has just the right amount of sweetness and bite.  I am optimistically sure that MTO Cafe runs more smoothly on a regular basis...I would love to come back to try other offerings. If they make me wait that long for food again though, It may be the last time.  - 2017 Review #10 -",

When the employee asked the chef about it, he got irritated and was very short and basically said to deal with it... all while I'm standing at the counter watching all this. So I had a dry bland salad because the chef doesn't give a damn. The chef, Young, is also the owner and a total asshole. Never coming back. The poor crew that works there have to deal with this man child's temper tantrum because he can't handle a little pressure. Good grief.",

I was indecisive so I asked what his favorite was. He asked breakfast or lunch. I told him lunch so he told me the spicy chicken sandwich was his favorite and offered one other suggestion. I decided to try the spicy chicken sandwich. When I got my order it was a pretty big size! After took my first bite I couldn't stop. It was definitely good! I got a side of ranch and noticed immediately it was unlike regular ranch. The guy told me it was made in house! For you ranch lovers out there.. you must try! This place deserves 5 stars...very friendly service, and the food was good! Would recommend to a friend and also would return! :D",

I usually go for the vegan pancakes with carrots, pecans, and agave syrup, along with the veggie hash with egg whites. The veggie hash is served in a skillet. Both are excellent. I also like the MTO break feast with egg whites, chicken sausage, turkey bacon, potatoes, and whole wheat toast. You definitely won't be disappointed with your meal.  The only complaint I have is the patio tables. I would enjoy dining on the patio, but most of the tables are wobbly and ready to topple over as soon as you place something on them. I am shocked that the manager would allow customers to sit at those tables. That issue needs to be addressed a.s.a.p.",

    "text": "Located in Downtown Summerlin, MTO Cafe appeared on my radar due to a recommendation from a co-worker.   We were greeted from the moment we entered the door! It's a small, but nice and clean, dining area. You order and pay at the counter and then grab a seat and they will bring your order to you.  (+) friendly service from the time we walked through the door until the moment we left!  (+) cafe was very clean and well organized. tables were cleaned and bussed in a fast and efficient fashion.  (+) food was very tasty and quite filling! steak was nice and tender and among the better cafe steaks I have had recently. actually everything tasted great and was well cooked with the exception of the toast, which was a bit burnt. no biggie though. (+) I do love those soda machines where you are able to mix and match sodas and flavoring, much like in some movie theaters!  (-) the only real knock on this place is that it is a tad bit pricey. $3.00 for a fountain soda is  bit high. 2 entrees and 2 drinks came to $35.69 before tip.   I enjoyed my first visit to the MTO cafe! At this price point it will probably be an \"every now and then\" option, but I am almost certain we will be back to try some other menu items!  4 stars.  Yay! I'm a fan.",

Prices are expensive for the amount of food you get and I think it's wrong for the machine to ask for a tip as you pay on the register before even getting food or service. It's self serve so basically why am I tipping, it's also tacky to leave a tip jar at the register when they only bring your food to your table as drinks and everything else is self serve. I don't see other restaurants asking for tips for the kitchen staff. Ordered the apple baked rings, while they tasted good I think it's ridiculous to pay $7 and only get 3 on a plate, very deceiving on the menu board. Will not return as I will continue to visit EAT downtown and other local restaurants there",

Nestled in the beautiful Downtown Summerlin, we were thrilled to find this delicious restaurant/take-out style cafe where you don't have to wait for table service, yet get to sit back and enjoy an awesome (comfort) meal.  My fiance raves about the BLTAE (Bacon Lettuce Tomato Avocado Egg) Sandwich. It's a huge portion with a heaping side of fries and well worth it's price tag. That alone lures him back twice a month (at least).  I, myself, first indulged in the Strawberry and Spinach Salad with Gorgonzola and a Balsamic dressing. That was delicious. Next I tried the Turkey Melt, and melt in my mouth, it did. So many awesome flavors in one bite - I don't know how they do it. Everything from the dressings to the toasting of the bread is perfectly mouthwatering.   I've also tried The Bob, which was fantastic. Sometimes they include these roasted cherry tomatoes, which are difficult to chew, but taste fantastic.   As for the service, we are always always greeted with a super friendly clerk who takes the order, delivers the food, and clears the table. They are even friendly enough to make suggestions on the menu and wait patiently while I indecisively try to order. We've never gone at a time where there's a line or crowd, so I suppose dinner isn't their busiest hour. Nevertheless, we always leave stuffed and so satisfied at the delicious crafting of foods here.  Highly recommend!",

Ambiance: The weather today was perfect for outdoor seating! ...But even if one chose to sit indoors, there is still plenty of natural light and they aren't blasting discourteous music (these are two factors I will always appreciate in any dining setting). The interior is trendy--that mod-retro feel with industrial accents. There are plenty of warm hues to make you feel hungry!  Service: What a friendly staff; they're always up to speed. When a customer leaves, the table is cleared within seconds. Everyone smiles--this is a good sign!  Food: You peruse the menu and order up front, are given a number and, then, you seat yourself. Orders come out of the kitchen pretty quickly and a majority of the menu items are a hit! I definitely appreciate the thought put into these flavor profiles. I recommend the KFC and the Philly. I urge everyone not to just eat the food, but to taste it.  MTO Cafe is an excellent addition to this neck of the woods.",

I had ordered a salad with dressing on the side to go for my friend.  When I got back to my house and she started eating it and noticed that there seemed to be dressing all over the salad.  So I took it back to MTO Cafe (luckily, we're only about 5-7 minutes away) and upon explaining the situation to the manager, she promptly said, \"I want to make this right; is it alright if I get a new salad made for you and refund you for the first one?\"  I wasn't expecting the refund and was taken aback at that and she said that she felt bad that I drove home and had to drive back.  We walked over to the register where a gentleman helped me with the refund and explained to me that the salad had dressing and an aioli.  He said it was completely reasonable to expect that someone who wanted dressing on the side would also want the aioli on the side, and apologized for the mix-up.    MTO Cafe went above and beyond for us today, definitely making a great impression on me and my friend.  We'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "This place is going to be (already is) busy!  Its nice to have another fast-casual option in Summerlin.    We went for \"brunch\".  I use quotes because MTO is one of those restaurants that has a little of everything on its all-day menu.  Ordered a waffle for the kids to share, I had the Reuben, wife had some healthy looking thing with Quinoa cakes (it looked good but I didn't pay attention to the clever name), and got the chicken pot-pie for my dad. Green juice and coffee for the wife, soft drinks for me and dad. Some friends met us so I also witnessed the falaffel, the broccoli skillet, clam chowder, onion soup, and kids pancake.  The food was very good, everybody's looked appetizing and I was glad that my dad didn't finish his pot pie because it meant I got to help him with this pretty decadent dish.  Fresh chicken pieces with the veggies in a skillet topped with fresh baked biscuits... it was delicious and probably a million calories.  My Reuben was made with \"corned buffalo\"... I assume that buffalo is leaner than beef, from a taste perspective it tasted like traditional corned beef.    The service was friendly and timing was fine (they apologized that it took long as they had only recently opened but it didn't feel too long to us... perhaps because we weren't in a rush and the kids weren't bouncing off the walls).   A few things of note:  - 4 entrees and 4 drinks... $76... not a bargain but not totally unreasonable in my estimation.    - They have one of those new fangled coke machines that dispenses hundred of different variations.  I like these when a restaurant is not busy, but they're a major hassle when busy as you wait for one person to select their beverage and then for the software to reset... not the restaurant's fault.  - Coffee... my wife ordered a plain black coffee, when I went to the counter to request a refill I was meant with looks of confusion.  Finally someone said we are not currently set up for complimentary refills. I replied, \"fine, I'll pay for it\"... after a little more scrambling on their part I went back to the register with her cup, asked for a refill, was reiterated that there was a charge for refill, now replied with annoyance in my voice \"got it, charge me\".  Upon paying the $3+ for an additional cup of plain coffee I said to the cashier \"I grasp the idea that you don't refill premium coffees such as lattes or cappuccinos but most breakfast-y places provide complimentary refills on plain drip coffee\"... He apologized and took 10% of the coffee (approx $0.30)... kind of insulting.     It was a little cold on the outside patio but the heaters helped and it was nice because we could sit there and watch the kids play on the other side of the patio.  We'll be back.",

    "text": "Underwhelmed. We gave MTO a try this morning while shopping for Christmas presents in Downtown Summerlin. We were in the mood to share a snack versus ordering a full meal each, so we went for the triple stack of Vegan Carrot Pancakes + Coconut and Agave Syrup. Despite how the item is worded on their menu and expecting a carrot cake version of vegan pancakes, we were served plain, flavorless, gummy pancakes topped with raw, shredded carrot, coconuts and agave syrup.  Like I said, flavorless and so odd. Who serves raw, cold carrot with warm pancakes? The textures were very strange and not at all pleasant. Plus, because the pancakes didn't taste like anything at all, all you could taste was carrot and coconut.   Won't be venturing back, but the food was quick and the staff were pleasant, for what it's worth.",

The omelette was $11...come on, really? It was not that serious of an omelette to get away with charging that. My daughter had the kids pancake. It was loaded with chocolate chips, powdered sugar and a red mystery gel. It was good but not for what they charged. All in I spent $30. I don't mind paying for quality OR quantity but this place was clearly neither. The atmosphere was nice and staff was nice. I will definitely not be back nor do I recommend this place. There are better spots to get food from with better portions and quality.",

They have a nice dog friendly patio, and wide menu from smoothies to chicken and waffles! I had the huevos rancheros and they are delicious!",

Here's what we ordered:   Steak and eggs :  Came with 3 eggs, hashbrowns, steak, your choice of toast, and choice of avocado (half or whole). Steak was delicious-- tender. Eggs were cooked perfect. The hash browns were buttery. So good.  K F C : Fried chicken, mash potatoes, a delicious gravy with a touch of sweetness which actually was amazing with the fried chicken. Ordered it with a side of avocado.    It was gorgeous outside today so we had lunch outside.  It was perfect.    Dale! Our guy who actually recommended these plates to us as we were ordering was very pleasant, informative, friendly, kind and attentive.  From taking our order to attending us at our table.  Was a pleasant visit at MTO.  It's a happy vibe at MTO.  Love it.   *bathrooms are clean guys",

I'm new to the area and trying a number of places, some good, some bad and a rare absolutely dreadful shows up, and today we have a winner in the dreadful category. Place is busy, stand in a 15 minute line for a single order taker, never mind there are another 3 vacant order positions at the ready but I digress. Sit at a filthy table and hope it gets cleared, alas it isn't. The egg and bacon sandwich shows up on an overly sweet roll, they cater to kids after all, and complete with cold hash browns that they call mash browns. All this place needs is a guy walking around in a giant rat costume to get the full effect. Parents with unruly kids rule the roost and now I can check off another considered location as a giant disappointment in Summerlin.",

We wait about 20 mins to get to the front of the line. As I approach the register the chef starts yelling: \"Stop! Just stop!\"  The entire place is startled. He continues to yell at one of the waitresses and looks like he is about to kill someone. The waitress walks over to the line and tells everyone that they won't be taking any more orders for a while. This is Saturday at lunch time. What??? I was there 2 years ago and service sucked. Decided to try i it again yesterday. Same poor management and employees who seem clueless. Back to Skinny Fats...",

The omelette (yoga pants) looked pathetic and was flavorless.  Extra charge for bruised avocado. A couple of tables were  dirty. I had hesitation  about even coming today because my last time here, my eggs were overcooked, horribly dry to where they get crunchy, but hubby wanted to grab something  quick. Quick, it was not, nor good. This is my last time here, there are sooooo many options in Vegas.",

We ordered some classics that were made to order with  fresh ingredients that left everyone satisfied.  The line was about 10 deep at 11:30 on the holiday but moved quickly. The menu is fairly large with both standard American breakfast and lunch fare. Our wait was about 5 minutes and after ordering through the fast casual set up and pouring our drinks, we had a seat outside where there was some shade to protect against the temperatures which were pushing into triple digits.  The food was brought out in a timely manner despite how busy it was. The tortilla was layered toward the top on my huevos rancheros which pleased me that the texture wasn't lost from the salsa and egg yolk. I also got to have half of my wife's turkey melt. With both dishes, the creamy, fresh avocado stood out the most.  Even though we were outside, an employee regularly checked on us and cleared our plates when we finished. Lunch for three was a little pricey at $42. This is a worthy stop if you're looking for standard breakfast or lunch and might not have time for a full sit down meal.",

A lady went up to them to ask them to move and one of the gentlemen blew smoke in her face. The employee also said that he was the owner of the company. I have no clue if he was or not but, it was not a good look.

I've been here a couple times & tried their burger, sandwich & soups. Everything I've had here so far has been good. The price is decent for being in a mall location. Sometimes the cafe can get a little busy, so seating can be a hassle but overall it's a good cafe to check out.",

    "text": "Have been to MTO Cafe at Downtown Summerlin a few times now.   Sometimes it was good (the clam chowder) and sometimes not so much. About one week ago I decided to try the Chicken Pot Pie as it's one of their signature dishes and I had seen the reviews on Yelp.   This dish was a deal breaker in that I won't be returning to this place ever again.   Presentation is cute, comes in a little skillet with biscuits. The chicken was flavorless and tough. I had to add a ton of salt just to have some sort of seasoning. The biscuits were so hard I had to use a knife to cut through them (think hockey puck) and then the taste was like cardboard (think cardboard). As I'm trying to navigate some flavor out of this dish, I happen upon a chicken bone, and I mean a large bone.   The waitress comes over, asks how the meal is, so I point to the bone and tell her (nicely) I don't think I would order this again and give her the particulars as stated earlier. She was nice and apologetic but nothing more. No manager was asked to come, she just trotted off like, \"oh well, thanks for coming in\", and left me.   So here I am staring down at my chicken bone, served with dried out hockey puck biscuits covering a tasteless goo of tough chicken and wondering, why I was paying $15 for this meal?  There are waaay to many options in this town to get great food so I'll be checking MTO off my list as one.",

I wasn't going to make a review and I tried to handle it before letting the world know about my experience. For starters after RETURNING 1 of the 4 meals we received the lady who also took my order had a complete attitude. After walking back to my job and calling trying to find out the supervisor or managers name she refused to give it to me by stating\" she doesnt know anyones first names\" smh. Im so disappointed on how they handled the mistakes of there service and refused to fix my problems. Everything was thrown on top of eachother in Togo boxes NOT PLATES. Everything was touching. The sausage was suppose to be well done and was damn near raw, they BURNT everyones bacon. The FRENCH TOAST was extrwmely soggy. I would never spend my money here ever again. So unprofessional and they dont seem to own up to any of the mistakes they have made on our $64.64 order. We threw everything in the trash and had to spend more money somewhere else. This is unbelievable how they wouldn't give me there managers or corporates information.   Receipt Number: xl9h Ticket number: 97 came in on July 25th @ 11:26Am",

    "text": "So, my husband, daughter and I escaped out last Saturday evening for a quick bite to eat at Downtown Summerlin.  I had seen some great things about MTO Cafe on Yelp and through Instagram and suggested we give it a try as we were going for something quick and easy.  We each ordered a salad and split a side of fries(I know kind of an oxymoron, but this was concidered a cheat meal).  We decided to sit on the patio, as I always love the option to do so.  We made our way out and had a seat.  Not long after a gentleman with a very large dog seated himself behind us.  No qualms by us about the dog, but that's what initially drew my attention to the fact that we weren't lone soldiers on the patio.  We received our food, which was great(review not 100% on that).  It was from that point that I began to listen to the gentleman behind us begin to boss the friendly cashier around as to his demands of his order.  Then, something was not up to par on his order and he called for the manager on duty that evening.  He came out, also a seemingly nice young man, and he too got an earful from this guy.    Now, never at any time, would I say this guy was yelling; but I repeatedly kept mouthing to my husband how rude this guy was behind us.  When we got up to leave, I was so curious to know about this guy as at this point I thought he couldn't have just been some customer off the street; he had to have an affiliation.  So, I walked back inside to ask the initial friendly cashier; and come to find out, he was a partner in the restaurant!   Mr. Matt Moore, if you are reading this, it is one thing to ensure the food that is coming our of your kitchen is prepared well; I can appreciate that immensely, but it's another to demean your employees on your restaurant's patio, especially when there are customers within earshot.  I definitely see you have a lot of experience in the design and construction industry.  And, I also see you served for us; THANK YOU for that.  However, may I make a small recommendation:  Customer Service.  You built this business for a reason and are a part of it's face.  When you are part of its face, I would imagine you most certainly wouldn't want customers thinking that face is full of belittlement or superiority, but rather support and collaboration.  YOU are part of YOUR brand....",

Very bland, under-seasoned.  $14 add a drink so about $20 after all said and done. That's not worth it IMO. At least the interior design and location is nice w/ Indoor and outdoor seating. Which is why it earns 3 stars instead of 2. TBH I'd rather go elsewhere than support their high overhead costs. I haven't been back their since. If a place wants to charge $14 I want full service and the food needs to not be bland.",

I also found the food overpriced, and customer service lacking.  They seem to expect a 15-20% tip for food you order at the counter, then when seated, I asked the server for a fork, she points us to a service stand?  WTF.

The \"chorizo\" skillet didn't even have chorizo in it. My boyfriend is Mexican I would know. The whole thing was bland. It was just so disappointing. Well on to the clam chowder, it actually has some decent flavor and seasoning. It had lots of chunks of clams which is a big plus. Usually places are not that generous with their clams. Lastly, my boyfriend's sandwich was just average. Nothing special. Overall MTO cafe is just meh. Nothing to it.",

The menu seems really good and tasty but if they can't get your order right and they don't serve everyone at the table at the same time it kills your lunch experience. My mother's order was the worst. She ordered the teriyaki steak bowl. The bowl came out about 10 minutes after the rest of the orders first of all. Secondly, she ended up only eating the steak because the rice was swimming, literally swimming in teriyaki sauce. It was like teriyaki soup with rice. My mom not wanting to complain too much didn't mention it to me until we were all done and she had finished most of the steak. So she went to the counter just to tell them hat they messed up the order, not asking for anything in return but just to make them aware of the type of dishes they are serving. My husband had ordered fries with his sandwich and was given a salad. They made that up by giving him a side of fries but the fries he was given looked like the bottom of the fryer fries, all scrape pieces and over cooked. My salad was ok but my chicken didn't seem to be grilled more like defrosted chicken and now that I think of it, I'm not sure if the dressing was on there or not. Anyways, we won't be back and I just hope they work out their quality control.",

MTO Cafe is right next to several other restaurants such as CPK and Maggianos. MTO Cafe has inside seating and outside seating. We decided to sit outside.   As you walk-in, you'll need to go to the counter to place your order. The menu is listed on the wall and you can also view a paper menu as you walk up to the counter.  I ended up ordering a hot chocolate and my boyfriend ordered a fettucine alfredo dish. We sat outside, on a summer day, in the Vegas heat.  The hot chocolate was custom made. It wasn't listed on their menu but they offered to make me one, which is super nice of MTO Cafe!! Thank you!!   The Alfredo dish was super yummy, the bite that I had from my boyfriends meal. It was different than what I am used to as it had a variety of vegetables included in the dish. The sauce wasn't thick, but more of a lightly tossed sauce in the pasta. It was really good and I would order this meal for myself next time.  MTO Cafe is a super cute and relaxing cafe. The service was superb! It is a little bit on the pricier side, but worth it for the food quality and customer service.",

I had my laptop and my stomach with me, so I decided I'd grab a quick lunch and clean up my email give this spot had free WiFi.   I was pleasantly surprised by the seasonal watermelon and feta salad I gobbled right and and it was all that much better seating on a comfortable padded bench/couch.   The salad was a bit small (and a bit pricey especially given the size), so I ended up ordering a side of sweet potato fries after I finished my salad. They were so good that I didn't even mine spending more money at this cafe!  They have a really nice outdoor seating area. I wasn't able to use it though, as I visited this place in the height of Vegas summer. But, when I visit again in cooler weather, you will likely find me seating outside.  So, to sum up, this place is a really decent cafe fast food spot and a comfortable place to get caught up on work while you're waiting for someone to take forever shopping at the mall...  I will definitely be back. Minus 1 star because the food is a little overpriced. But that won't stop me from returning.  Take it from this UNLV professor, A-",

Asked them to redo it, and they did, but then the second come around for the redone meats were bad also. The meat was so hard, very difficult to eat, and  partially burned.",

I ordered the BLTAE with a salad but without the A-avocado. The egg enhanced the meal however, it could been cooked a bit more and the meal was just warm not hot. As I began eating it open faced I did enjoy the pesto sauce on it. The salad dressing was a balsamic vinaigrette but was a bit sweet for me. The service at the register was nice and he had patience because again my 1st time there and I didn't know what I wanted. Overall, I'll give this place one more try.",

The server asked how I wanted my steak (medium rare) which was an absolute joke because the steak on the breakfast tacos was the opposite of medium rare. More like overcooked - as were the scrambled eggs,  which were brown all over. The corn tortillas fell apart and the whole mess was tasteless and inedible. No amount of hot sauce could fix that mess. My husband ordered chicken and waffles, which is supposed to have fried chicken. This arrived with pieces of chicken doused in a gravy with a weird cinnamon flavoring, which was an awful combination with the chicken. The waffles were okay but the gravy was overkill. We won't be spending our money here, for anything other than a cup of coffee. There are far better breakfast options in Summerlin (in fact, go across the street to the Red Rock Casino for a fantastic, reasonably priced breakfast at the Grand Cafe).",

MTO sereves a very nice breakfast/ brunch before the stores open on a Sunday morning. So it is a great place to fuel up and/ or relax before getting a bit of shopping done. My favorite spot has been sitting outside on the patio watching the day begin in Downtown Summerlin.  The food is very good especially for the time of day that I come here which is breakfast/ brunch time.  The menu items have natural and a higher quality ingredients, which makes for a perfect start of the day. A couple of my favorites have been The California chicken sandwich and the Avocado Toasts. The Californian is truly a great sandwich- everything tastes fresh and non-greasy although there is bacon inside! The Avocado toast is also a great beginning at under $5! There are other wonderful menu options that I am excited to come back and try.  The people who work at MTO are so sweet and adorable. Everyone is friendly and they make sure that you have everything you need. Even my 22 year old daughter has fallen in love with this place, which says a lot because she is picker than I am!  See you soon MTO! xoxo",

By the time I realized this, we were essentially there, and it was not worth the effort to get to the sister restaurant.   The setup was a little wonky. The entrance to the line was a little odd for me, but the more disturbing issue was how loud the music was. The selection wasn't bad, but sometime it felt like I was in a club and had to yell across the table in order to be heard.   As for the food, the tree hugger salad was pretty good. The two quinoa patties were very hearty, and the accompanying salad was also tasty. I didn't get the KFC as I had planned in order to stay a little healthier, but I'm certain I will get that next time, whichever MTO I end up in.   4 items totaling $55+ prevented this from being an excellent value, but it certainly didn't break the bank. I'll stop in again if I'm in the area next time, and hopefully the music volume will be normalized by then.",

Ordered steak medium and eggs over medium specifically said \"not runny\"   It came out in the most un-appetizing lazy pile of grease and runny egg goo. I could hardly tell the difference between what was butter and what was yolk. Sent back and second time eggs were just as gross and they argued with me about what \"over medium\" means. I literally said \"this is gross\" it was. I ate some steak (ok wouldn't order again) the hash browns tasted weird and I slid the eggs into a Togo box to cook at home. But it was literally so gross I can't bring myself to even re cook this stuff I have steak left too.   I ate all of the toast. So basically I had $20 of toast and they only have grape jelly.   Went to store and bought my own eggs today and they were great...  Mto should know how to cook an egg. Clearly it was done on high heat in a vat of butter or oil. Only runny eggs can be done that way without burning or slithery grossness and I'm not easily weirder out by eggs. It was weird. I wanted nothing to do with this and I was starving after hardly eating for 24 hours...",

It's all served in a hot cast iron skillet so the dish stays warm while you are enjoying it! Nothing worse to me than cold scrambled eggs. My meal was at noon and I love that I could order eggs.... Because sometimes A girl just wants breakfast for lunch!  I'll be back to try out the rest of the menu!",

Ordered their blt that comes with avocado, the tomato basil soup which comes with a grilled cheese basically (they just call it cheese toast since it's regular bread) and a huge Cobb salad. Ate my food without taking a picture because I couldn't wait to dig in. I still have 3/4 of my salad left. Their portions are BIG.  It's the kind of place you order and then sit down and wait for food. It has upbeat music and the staff is super friendly. My only complaint is they were out of Dr Pepper which I'm addicted too lol they have one of those cool touch screen soda fountains and I didn't even know there were so many types of sprite. Will definitely be back.",

Amber at the front is always super nice, and Chris one of the managers is really attentive every time I have ever asked for anything.   My favorite healthy option is the Tree Hugger, with a secret hack to add chicken. The Tree Hugger is a quinoa patty sandwich with a great spicy aioli. The added chicken completes the meal, as I always want a protein.  If you're feeling healthy schmealthy, the chicken and waffles is a MUST try.  Overall, lots of options, good food and really friendly staff.",

He even brought me the other dressing to try. It was delicious and healthy with lots of arugula and cukes. The hubby ate the BLTAE sandwich which was highly recommended on Yelp.

    "text": "Last night we went to the MTO cafe in downtown Summerlin and sad to say that will be our only visit. The menu looks interesting on line and even sounds good but this was by far the blandest food I and my mom have ever had. It's as if the cook didn't realize you do need to use some sort of salt on the food to make it tasty.  My mom got the bob chicken sandwich and for 12 bucks they really need to rethink serving it on just regular old wheat bread. Mom said it was just \"okay\" but would not get it again IF we came back.   I had the hangover burger which is supposed to be an 8 ounce triple angus burger with bacon,fried egg,cheddar cheese and special sauce. This burger lacked any flavor at all. It was smaller the the bun it was on,the bacon was over cooked ,the \"cheddar cheese\" not sure if it was on the burger or not.  The fried egg was cooked correctly but again someone needs to tell the cook salt and pepper are okay to add when cooking. In fact I wonder if the burger was even angus because it was bland and sad looking in color. At 14 bucks I expect much more.  I could have gone to McDonald's for the third of the price and had a better meal.  The young man working as cashier,server and general cleaning person for the place wasn't overly friendly but he wasn't rude either. He did however leave our food sit in the window while he wiped down the coke machine and the counters.   I wouldn't recommend wasting your money here especially with the amount of restaurants in downtown Summerlin I am sure there are better options.",

Like I said, I dined at the MTO downtown so I was ready to enjoy this coffee when it tasted like steamed milk. I popped to the top off to see what it looked like steamed milk with a splash espresso.

I accidentally order the grilled cheese instead of the kids grilled cheese and they fixed it ASAP. The Bob Sandwich was delicious, the wings were different and fantastic, fries were thin and hot and the MTO doughnuts were mmmMM honeylicious. I recommend this place over Crave or Skinny Fats. It's yummy comfort food for less than $50.",

All this for $11 & I had to eat again afterward because it so small. Now come on MTO give your customers what they paid for & put some more food on the plate!!

    "text": "After sampling a Hangover Burger at the Redline Rendezvous YEE, I looked forward to going to the new MTO Cafe to try more of its offerings at the source.  So, Diane and I met another couple there to do just that.  At first I was put off a bit by the spartan interior, lack of any other customers at the time, and that there was no waiter service.  For some reason, I had it in my head that the MTO Cafe would be much like the Sahara's old bustling full-service Nascar Cafe, and be a haven for comfort food.  I was right on the second supposition, but in error on the first.  And, I was slightly embarrassed that I had recommended such a casual, seemingly fast food eatery as a place to sit down to dinner with friends.  But once the food arrived, and I gazed at and initially tasted my BLTAE, my concerns were quickly dispelled.  My friends were pleased with their food: a Black & Blue Burger with French Fries, and a Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Tomato Soup, as was I.  Only Diane lamented that her Hangover Burger was not medium rare as requested.  Yet this place is decidedly not a fast food joint.  Some very good creative cooking occurs here.  I had almost instructed the order taker to hold the egg, but thought it would be more sporting and adventurous to try a BLTAE just as is was intended to be served.  This turned out to be a wise decision, for the oozing egg yolks from two quite large and perfectly prepared Sunnyside Up Fried Eggs lubricated and added flavor to the large sammie, which I had to figure out how best to eat.  I was initially torn between cutting through one-half of the heaping and rather messy sandwich with a knife and then eating it with a fork or wrestling with it by hand, before just picking it up with one hand the normal way and directing it at my mouth.  But to get my mouth around this imposing specimen on a plate took some doing.  Yet after opening my mouth like a gaping upraised garage door, sliding the loaded and egg yolk-drenched bread slices inside, and then chomping down on the strips of crispy bacon, I was in comfort food heaven, and knew that this sandwich could be eaten in the conventional manner.  Slices of red tomatoes and shards of lettuce, large chunks of very fresh avocado, and a generous heaping of excellent crisp matchstick Fries added to the enjoyment of my meal, along with a multi-variety Coke dispenser with unlimited refills.   In rating a restaurant, In my book the quality and taste of food are of paramount importance.  And, although the ambiance here was somewhat stark and resembled a school cafeteria, the place was clean, and restaurant staffers were friendly, helpful, and accommodating.  I expect to be back!",

Burnt buns slathered with unnecessary butter. Strips of bacon that taste like old processed bacon bits.  Fries - completely cold, hard as rocks, and obviously not fresh   Apple Rings - no crispy texture at all, dough falling off of rings. Again - complete mush.   No flavor. Just garbage.   $25 + for this horrible meal. Don't order from here unless it's a salad  I've spoken to a manager twice in regards to getting a refund. (A few minutes after receiving my order and again yesterday when I noticed that the promised refund hadn't been issued.) During my initial call I was told \"Yea, our food does turn to mush if it isn't eaten within a certain timeframe & it took your UberEATS driver 40 mins to arrive.\" Um...ok how about you inform your drivers of the mush problem? Jeez. He then told me \"I will contact UberEATS and have them issue a refund. You won't have to do anything else.\"  Fast forward to yesterday and there is still no refund. I call again and speak to Leland. He asks for my name and phone number and tells me that UberEATS will be calling me in regards to my refund. No call.   So at this point I'm done. The food isn't stellar to begin with but charging over $25 for 3 items that were inedible, acknowledging the problem, & then lying about attempting to remedy the situation just ensures that I, nor anyone I know, will do business with MTO Cafe ever again.",

A completely different experience than I had last time although my friend says the other location is waaaay better.   My friend says eggs are organic. Did not hear that from the staff do please double check.  The hash browns are their signature potatoes & they were unusual & unexpected. It seems like they are hash brown potatoes wrapped around mashed potatoes.  Very unusual. I had to kind of taste it a few time. I Liked It. Very different, try them.   The eggs were absolutely perfectly cooked! Over medium & they were exactly that.   The meats on my special were assorted. I am not a spam fan so that went to waste.   I wish they had an option for the bread. I skipped it as did my friends. So we paid for it & got no other choice. I think this could be improved on.   The bacon was crispy & tasted great.   I got some kind of a chocolate or carib drink that was very good.    It is a menu that could be better understood with photos. For a new person like me, it is off putting.  I hope they add a photo menu or iPad or screen or something to help new people order.   Sitting outside, it was extremely pleasant.   Definitely recommend.",

I ordered a patty melt medium well with fries and a fountain drink. So , seriously the music is so loud I can't even speak on the phone,so I go outside to make the call I came back in and enough was enough I went to the front and asked her to turn it down,the acoustics are very bad and just made it worse. After she turned it down a few if the customers thanked me. I get my food. What a disgusting mess.  The sandwhich was slathered in 1000 island dressing,the toast was greasy. And the fries were a train wreck. I went up to complain and this kid server says to me. That's the way they are made,really? Overly cooked to the point that there is no fry but a fried shell? Ugh,sorry not acceptable, please replace them with hashbrown..then she just walks away I say I don't want them she said it's ok you can keep them, she walks away and I grab a knife and I have to wipe them off my plate into the garbage. Replace means take my plate you moron and replace them. She then brings me out the hash browns totally disgusting overly cooked and nasty greasy taste. I asked for the burger medium well..it came out medium rare and the meat made me want to hurl. All this abuse for 18 dollars. You know what I'm getting sick of shitty crappy over priced garbage and stupid young ditzy kids serving it. This place is a big fat zero. Stop overcharging for horrible food and service,it's bs.",

I would give this place a solid 4 stars if it wasn't for the prices.   Now I'm not one to complain about the cost of stuff. If it's good, I will justify it. But keep in mind this is a quick service place. Order at the counter, get your own soda and they bring your food out to you. So when I see $7 for a cup of tomato soup, Nope, that's where I draw my line.   My spinach salad was so awesome but without chicken ($3 extra) it would have been a little boring simply because it would have only been 3 ingredients- spinach, quinoa and tomatoes. My honey got the tri-tip breakfast plate and the meat was rare (not even warm it was cooked so quick). So we brought it back up and the quickly fixed it but the flavor was just very beefy (not in a good way). The rest of the plate was delicious but he wouldn't order it again. Said he'd go back to the protein plate instead.   Overall, yummy and quick but it hits your pocket just a little too hard. Which makes MTO more of an occasional lunch stop instead of a regular one.",

But as they always say, \"don't judge the book by its cover\". That's what I did and nothing did change.  I ordered a chicken falafel. The falafel itself is pretty big and could be shared. However, it tasted nothing special. Sad to say, it's too commercialized. I ordered some fries too, which is pretty crispy and good.....You can't go wrong with fries anyway!!  I believe they have a special drink every now and then. I'm not quite sure how often they change or have that. But that day, I had Mango Lemonade, which is sweet and refreshing. However, it also tasted like as if it came from just the concentrates.   Price is not so bad. I wouldn't come here if you can still wait to find a better place to eat and explore.",

    "text": "Was hungry during lunch hours so why not brunch right? Passed this place numerous times located in Downtown Summerlin, me and wifey decided to go check it out. The minute me and wifey walked in we were greeted loudly \"welcome to MTO Cafe!\"  I waited impatiently in line for about 7 minutes before I could order which I think was a bit long, there were only two in front of me. I ordered the Turkey Melt along with their New England clam chowder, with a cup for water. I paid via their tablet system with a credit card, using my finger to sign. The cashier gave me a number to place on my table so they would know where to bring the food.   This place is unique in that other then the staff bringing your food you do all the work. From getting the utensils and napkins to even getting the condiments up front by the register. I honestly don't mind this approach as 1 it's less to worry about them screwing something up and 2 there is not spot to tip on the bill! Only a tip jar. They must pay their employees handsomely.   The ambience seemed busy as it was crowded but definitely welcoming with its random art and warm color tones. They even have USB ports by their seats in case you need to charge up. The Clam Chowder was awesome, had bacon bits in it, which they told me about beforehand. The turkey melt was equally amazing, although I feel they skimped on the cheese, also not to crazy about stringy fries but that's just a personal preference.   So aside from the wait, stringy fries, and lack of enough cheese in my sandwich I'd say for sure we'll be coming back again as my complaints aren't that dire.",

The salmon was red and super salty.  I like salty, but I felt like I was just eating salt.  Comes with cream cheese, dill, eggs, and hash browns.  I like my salmon orange and marbleized, so I'm not sure why this salmon is red.  Was it some sort of dye to preserve the salmon to keep it fresh?    Maybe I'll give MTO another shot and try something else, but the smoked salmon...never again.",

I've always wanted to try this place out, but it's always busy. I went around 3PM and surprisingly there were no line. I was like wow, on a Saturday?   I went with a few others and the first thing come to mind when we saw the menu, a bit too pricy. Price ranges from $11.00 to $13.00. I just wanted something light and not too expensive, but since we already there, I figured why not just try it. I figured with that price, I'm sure it was going to be a big portion.   We ordered two lemon cilantro chicken salad ($12.00) and spicy chicken sandwich ($13.00). Both were okay, nothing different. I'm sure you can find something way less than the menu price elsewhere. Overall, atmosphere is clean, love the location, staffs were friendly.",

They claim it's 4 cheese; sure 97% Velveeta and 1% each of 3 other  cheeses, but it still tastes like Velveeta, with a hint (small hint) of blue. Would not order again. My wife ordered a hamburger, listed for $9.95. It rung up as $10.95 and included a bun with fries, nothing else. We asked about lettuce and tomato and that was 2 bucks more. To add cheese, another buck.  Hello, I can go to Gordon Ramsey's Pub at Caesar's and get his burger for that. Thumbs down.",

First, they only had one person working the register while 6 people randomly acted busy behind him. The line built up and took forever while the 6 other staff did menial tasks like put ice cubes in the sink. After waiting in line for 15 minutes, they somehow lost our order. It took another 30 minutes for them to deliver any food. The help eventually came over to tell us they were going to put a rush order on our food but it still took them another 15 minutes after that. For our trouble, they offered us a free pastry, which nobody wanted. Eventually we just left and never received half of our order. Terrible experience",
