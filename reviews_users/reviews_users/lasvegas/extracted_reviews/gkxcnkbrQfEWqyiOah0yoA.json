The staff is very knowledgeable and can easily help with any guidance needed when ordering. The kitchen staff had the food out in a timely manor and seemed quite organized for such a busy establishment. I will definitely be back when passing through this neighborhood again.",

We both got breakfast dishes, the brisket hash and the biscuits and gravy. I had read reviews that the portions were huge, but that must be the lunch/dinner dishes because ours were not that big. The people sitting next to us had lunch though (it was about 1pm) and their portions did look quite large. I enjoyed the sweet potato and brisket hash. My eggs (over easy) were just fine. I did enjoy the biscuit that came with it too, but the topping (savory crumbly topping of onion, poppyseed, etc) was good but there was quite a lot of it. That was kind of overkill for me. My husband's biscuits and gravy dish was very good, though seemed a little small.   Employees were nice, seemed to know what was going on. They've only been open a few days and I could hear some training going on behind the counter, but I didn't mind that. The wait for the food was a bit longer than we would have liked. They had a little dispenser out for water, though the water could have been colder and the glasses set out for it were on cloth so the glasses ended up with a little lint on them. I think a tray would have been a safer bet for cleanliness personally. I did consider it to be a bit pricey for the type of place it was (you order at the counter and they call your name to come get your food) and the portion sizes (but again, lunch/dinner portions looked bigger). Our total was $27 for two breakfast plates.",

This chicken must have been made by a Four...NAY, a Five Star General.  It is the best fried chicken I have eaten in Las Vegas by a country mile!  We also enjoyed the pimento cheese along with the Wicked deviled eggs.  The eggs had bacon as well as candied (yes candied) jalepenos.  I can't \"crow\" enough about Mama Bird!",

We checked in with yelp and were given a cool and refreshing slice of watermelon with an original watermelon lime sherbet. Everything was home made and very good. The decor is very modern and charming. We met one of the owners who was really nice. Try it!!",

Also loved their cowboy candy jalapenos so much I had to buy two jars. Looking forward to going back and trying something else. Service was awesome and staff was super friendly and accommodating. I almost want to go back for dinner",

My oldest who is a chicken fanatic said \"best chicken tenders and comeback sauce ever! Even better than Canes\"  The watermelon lemonade was AMAZING and definitely my drink of choice from here on out while visiting. Just like my last visit, the staff was beyond helpful and accommodating to our kids picky choices. The deviled eggs were so delicious, may even be better than my moms (don't tell her) serving size is big, so come hungry or even better, know you'll have leftovers for the next days lunch! Thank you Mama Bird, see you guys again soon!",

I highly recommend this place to anyone craving authentic Southern food I recommend trying the pork belly and grits. I grew up eating grits regularly as a small child and have had my fair share of grits from the south. This place has better grits than my grandmother.",

    "text": "I've been during this place since they've opened and I finally made my way tonight for a late dinner.  I ordered the brisket slider, small side of Mac n Cheese, small side of collard greens and 3 deviled eggs. 1 with bacon and 2 without.  I am impressed. I am from the south born and raised and I've been down talking Vegas soul food and bbq since I moved here 7 short months ago. I will now gladly recommend mama bird. Although I haven't had the chicken.. yet! I know it's going to be good.  I had to ask for bbq sauce for my slider, it was a little dry but I suppose that's because I came a hour before close. The brisket meat was a little charred and dry but I have faith that it was just this batch.  The EGGSSS are SOO GOOD! Reminds me of my granny's and I never compare her cooking to anybody because no one has ever been worthy. Lol The greens were good, they're meat filled which is nice and the levels of salt, sweet and Acid was done really well. The Mac n cheese could use a little love but I'd still order it again!  Overall, I'm satisfied and finally have a place to come when I'm feeling home sick",

    "text": "I give them credit for trying and a good decor and layout but the actual flow of the restaurant and (more importantly) the food is just not good. We ordered the biscuits and gravy and the biscuits were ok but that sausage gravy is an embarrassment. If you add a ton of pepper to it to give it some flavor maybe it's passable. But bland.  The scrambled eggs were dry to the bone. I didn't even eat those. Then I got the fried chicken and biscuit. The biscuits are ok but I could've used some jam. They don't have any jam. Apparently in the whole restaurant.   The chicken was a total miss. Way too much batter and no flavor. Even with hot sauce it just isn't good. It's really hard to find real authentic southern food in vegas and this is just a continuation of that trend. If you're going to do southern food, you need flavor and spice and to take some risks. This is none of those.  Lastly they should rethink the format. Ordering and  then sitting and then going back to the counter to get food for each portion is so silly. Either do a sit down restaurant or do numbers and being out the food as it's done. It's chaotic to walk back and forth for everything.",

So one of the employees said that the wicked deviled eggs are a must try and I couldn't agree more. He also told us to eat the egg as if it was a shot (no problem here) which helped get the full flavor. Bacon of course makes everything delicious but along with the jalapeno, it was the best shot I think I've taken lol. We should have gotten 6 of them. The pitmasters scramble was so heavenly. Every bite was full of flavor. The brisket was amazingly sweet, the pork belly savory! I was a little concerned about cheese sauce being put on top....but I would have put that on everything it was soo good. Recommend this dish for sure. I have to come back ASAP to try other things on the menu. Service was good and everyone was friendly, but just know that you have to place your order at the cashier (I thought the waitress was going to serve us so we sat there looking silly).  5 stars!!",

I love the boneless fried chicken and we tried the pecan smoked ribs and it has a really old fashioned smoked taste.   I hope they have some choices of sauce, specially on the spicy blend. I also like an old fashioned bone in fried chicken instead of the boneless one though I must admit the boneless taste good too. The collard green is among the best that I have tried.  The water melon soft serve is a must try folks.",

I wanted some fried chicken, and we wanted to try this restaurant, so we gave it a try.  As to the fried chicken, the best fried chicken in Vegas is either at the Brooklyn Bowl or Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken (same owners).  The fried chicken at mama bird is not as good as fried chicken you can get at KFC.  First, Mama Bird does not season at every level.  The chicken itself is very bland.  The dredge is also very bland.  Second, MB uses boneless chicken breasts.  Third, the breading is large and clumpy and lacks the overall look and taste of what you would expect from fried chicken.    The ribs were good, but looked like they were frozen.  There is just a look that you know when you make ribs or order them from a BBQ restaurant.  The sauce was very good.  If you want awesome ribs, go to Culinary Dropout.    Finally, the sides....  What can I saw, you know canned corn when you see it.  MB would be better off using Del Frisco's recipe for cream corn that uses frozen corn, which is available online, but whatever.  This dish was meh.  The Mac N Cheese was okay if you like boxed Mac N Cheese.  It tasted like MB put processed cheese like Velveeta in its Mac N Cheese.  It tasted okay, but a restaurant should probably use an actual bechamel sauce as a base, especially at the prices charged by MB.    It was nice to try, but we won't be going back.",

The pimento cheese was really good and fun to eat. Could have used way more crackers - 8 saltines just didn't do it.",

Everyone around us was fed up with waiting as well. Never did we receive an apology either due to waiting 30 minutes. Never even a \"your food is coming up shortly\". Nothing. I told my husband if our food isn't here within 5 minutes we will ask for our money back and leave.   Someone should've come around and said \"I'm so sorry for the delay, is there anything I can get you while you're waiting. Refills or anything\" or better yet \"so sorry for the delay we'd love to have you come back and try us out again another day and we'd be happy to comp one of your meals\" nothing.   When we came in also we were never greeted when we entered. We stood around in the front bc we weren't sure if we seat ourselves or what. The cashier and chef both looked at us and never said \"hi welcome in, look at the menus and then order up here\". Nothing.  Very disappointed in the lack of customer service here. They need to work on that big time!   The food was just ok. The biscuits and gravy was probably one of the best ones I've had. My husband chicken and waffles wasn't very good and cold. So we will not be back. Very disappointed.",

I've eaten a variety of the items and the best things are the pork belly and the fried chicken breast. The thigh is good too but the breast is perfection. Very surprising since I love dark meat fried chicken everywhere else.   The Mac and cheese is also really good. Probably one of the best. It's been busy the times I dined in but not too long of a wait.   Hope they keep up the quality and looking forward to trying the rest of the menu",

    "text": "Ordered the chicken sandwich with fries and the chicken and waffles meal.  Me, my husband, and 3 kids all shared the 2 meals because the prices were not in our budget.  We waited about 20 mins for our food, not too bad (but it gave me enough time to walk to smiths and buy a container of watermelon because I wasn't going to pay $4 for a slice for my kids). My expectations were not very high because I was already having big regrets for even walking in when I saw how expensive the menu was.  The chicken was fried pretty good and juicy!  Not much flavor but I dipped it in syrup so it was all good.  The waffles were...waffles (just whatever). But the butter!.... the butter was pretty good!  Not sure what they put in it (slightly oily, sweet, and some herb in it). The fries that came with the sandwich were good also, or was it the dipping sauce that made it good?  Yes, I really enjoyed the sauce!   -Im glad we gave it a try but I don't think we will ever go back.  Between the wait for a clean table, then the 20 min wait for our food, the cook that was yelling a little too loud, and the expensive fried chicken.  Maybe I will go back and buy a side of butter tho!",

The sandwich had a bit too much cheese overall and the \"southern\" fries (the sweet potato fries) were pretty good but needed a little more seasoning. I got the biscuits and gravy with eggs which was definitely a different type of biscuit and gravy I had ever had. The everything biscuits were really good, and this is coming from someone who doesn't like everything bagels. The gravy was good but was lacking in the sausage which could definitely give it some of the flavor it was missing.   The watermelon lemonade itself is worth the trip over here in my opinion. They do watermelon lemonade right! I think next time I'll try the fried chicken, I saw it come out for someone else and wished I had room to try it this time!

We had the Wicked Deviled Eggs, Smoked Brisket Hash, Boneless Breast Fried Chicken with Mac n' Cheese, Sweet Cream Corn, and Watermelon Lemonade. Taste-wise, everything was amazing. The Everything Biscuit that came with the meals is crave-worthy. I'm very picky about biscuits; there's only 2 places I like biscuits from... well, now 3 hehe. I'd come back here just for the biscuits.  Service was painfully slow today but I have a feeling it isn't normal. I will be back to test out that theory",

Here is what you need to know: -the food is pretty good and they have cool watermelon inspired treats. -great for take out  -not great for dining in : okay customer service, the people are sweet, and might just be understaffed. Chaotic, self seating and self serving which can be cool in a bigger space.  When we had takeout we did dinner items greens, chicken and it was delicious and pretty hot considering we used postmates. When we dined in we had brunch : chicken and waffle, biscuits and gravy, shrimp and grits. The flavor for everything was delicious, but pretty cold. If we had a better dine in experience with hot food and less chaos I would give it 5 stars. The food was a 4 and the service a 2.5 so I would give it a 3.5 if I could.  Hopefully next time will be better!",

It was our first time here and Coleen was so helpful. She told us all of the dishes she personally recommends, along with customers favorites, and all the staffs favorites. We were checked on by three of their staff members throughout our time here and everyone was very friendly.  The food was absolutely delicious! We ordered the deviled eggs, chicken & waffle, and the 3 piece breast with a side of Sweet Cream Corn. Their fried chicken was easily one of the BEST fried chicken dishes we have ever had. Not to mention, the great balance of flavors on the deviled eggs and sweet cream corn. The waffle was the perfect balance of crispy and soft. I can go on and on about how great this place was but all I can say is I definitely recommend this!   For your enjoyment, I've attached pictures of our food.",

We spent about $120 for the four of us and our drinks. The watermelon lemonade was delicious and the deviled eggs were pretty good. The food was plentiful as well seasoned, the brisket wasn't fatty and the ribs were tender. They make their own BBQ sauce that was good, and the sides were all well done. We got white cheddar grits, creamed corn, and coleslaw.   We had a slight issue with missing an item from our order and they rectified the issue immediately. The food was good but I do wish more of the sides came with the meal, we ran out quick and pretty much had a meat fest. I also wish they had free refills on drinks, the food is mouthwatering good, but still- biscuits and no drink is a recipe for disaster.",

Going clockwise: - deviled eggs  (bacon and candied jalapeno on top. Ate it as a whole in one bite to taste all the flavors). - Mac n Cheese fried chicken sandwich  (huge portion and great deal for the price!). - fried chicken + waffle  (can't go wrong with this! Fried chicken was so crispy ). - pecan smoked baby back ribs  and smoked brisket  with a side of gooey mac n cheese (so tender and flavorful even without the sauce!! The biscuit was also so buttery and yummy!). - non alcoholic strawberry ginger beer in a mug  (fun, fruity, and refreshing taste) . A sweet treat! - watermelon soft serve  (so refreshing and perfect sweetness level to end the meal) . Definitely one of the places you wanna visit in Vegas!

Not a refund just a remake.  It took a ridiculous amount of time to get my food the second time around. While my family finished their food at the restaurant I walked to Smiths to pick up a prescription and back only to notice my new omelette still hadn't reached the table. I then watched a group of 5 that came in well after my plate was sent back  to the kitchen receive their meals before my to-go box of food came out. The icing on the cake was getting to the car only to find they didn't even make my omelette properly. It wasn't what I'd originally ordered. I also had a chicken tender on my original plate that wasn't  in the to-go box either. Long story short I definitely got my money back but only because I asked for it. They didn't seem to care that my food had hair in it and demonstrated no sense of urgency in rectifying situation...they actually didn't even pay attention to what was on the plate that I sent back.",

Not too busy as it was around 5pm when we got there.   Super cute decor. Definitely aesthetically pleasing. You can immediately order as you walk in - as the cashier station is right there. It was a bit confusing when I got in because while I stood in line to order, they were also entering a phone order from my side of the booth, not inside. But it was cool as the staff was friendly. They took our order and we waited for about 15 minutes til we got our order. I got chicken and waffles and my husband got the brisket with creamed corn. My chicken was really good! Crispy on the outside but the batter was still a bit raw inside---I'm just glad the chicken was fully cooked! Not sure why the batter was still a bit wet though. Oh wells. Tasted my husbands brisket and it was juicy and flavorful. Not dry like many bbq briskets I've had before. The creamed corn was alright. I've had better. I was hoping it'd taste just like the one I've had in Texas but it didn't.   I'll give it a few more months til we go back to give them a chance to improve on what needs to be improved as they are fairly new. Goodluck!",

Walked into this nice and cozy place based on Yelp reviews.  Not disappointed at all. The chicken was had by all and all was great.  Service was great, people had the best personality and they made us feel at home. The fried chicken was amazing.  The greens we great, I highly recommend.  I also had the cheesy grits,  1 brisket slider made with there soft  biscuit.  My wife has the mac and cheese .  There was not one thing that I would not recommend. I also ordered a  note of their housemade Apricot Ginger and it was really good.  My daughter lived there watermelon drink too.  The crew Lrwady said that we are coming back here the next time we are in town.",

We placed our order for the chicken & waffles and the special brisket  with mac and cheese.  Right after that a order for one of the online food service delivery's came in.  The driver registered the order.  We sat down and waited for our order.  Something happened with our order as well as the drivers pickup order.  We were both waiting there for over an hour.  The wait staff realized something was going amiss when they walked passed us and saw our order number.  They had a computer glitch that dropped our order.  They apologized and gave us a free appetizer and desert.  Other than the computer issued, the food was great.  Bring an appetite.  The wait staff was hustling to get orders out and tables bussed and clean.   To avoid headaches,  go when its not peak times.  The first time I went was before peak times.  I will go back just not during high traffic times.",

The apple slaw had some pineapple which gave it a light airy taste was a very good compliment for the perfectly fried chicken thighs.

Waffle sandwiches were ok warm not hot. Next the thigh plate. Cutting into the chicken it was greasy, warm and under cooked. Mostly breading. The chicken skin was thicker than the chicken. And not fully cooked. The biscuit was hard as if it had sat in the air a long time. Next the water was refilled and we eagerly filled our glasses only to taste warm tap water. Really disappointed in the quality and the price. Our 3 meals with ice tea was over $50. Sorry to say we will not return.",

The service was top notch...delivered to my home on time with the chaffing dishes and all.  I will definitely cater from Mamma Bird in the future.

Food took a little while to be served, and did not receive the Mac and cheese. Told the counter we did not receive the side and they said they would bring right out. 15 mins later no Mac and cheese. Go back to counter to remind them. The hostess then takes the Mac and cheese to the wrong table and gives them 2 jars of dessert as an apology. We go back to the counter and say still haven't gotten. When she realized she took it to wrong table she said omg let me get my manager. Didn't even explain to her manager what happened. And all the place did was give us the cost of the Mac and cheese back, but the wrong table got dessert on top of it all. Again, good food but not worth the complete lack of service.",

We also had Pecan Smoked Pork Ribs, which literally fell off the bone.  They had three sauces to try, and we really liked their traditional, which was not too sweet and not to spicy - just the right amount of both for this Midwesterner!  And they had a green verde sauce with tomatillos and peppers which was unique and went well with everything...the chicken, ribs and collards.  3 outdoor tables and chairs were just added yesterday, which makes it a perfect place for a relaxing Sunday morning breakfast spot!",

Hubby got the pecan smoked spare ribs - so tender. If you've never been here, get here!!!!!! We're only here for a couple of days but we're already hooked. My chicken is CRUNCHY on the outside and juicy on the inside. Oh, and I forgot to mention the collards. They're so good. Food is fresh, so there's a little bit of a wait after ordering but that's how you can tell quality. Totally worth every second. After paying the bill, we came back to buy a bottle of the strawberry ginger and the jalapeno ginger drink. Can't wait to use them as mixers. Very refreshing even without alcohol.",

Only served three days a week, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday you have the opportunity to taste wings at their best! Marinated, smoked, and battered in delicious goodness. They're served with sauces, but truly do not need a drop. They are beautifully smoked with the perfect amount of spices, and fried to crispy perfection. Don't miss out! Can't wait to go back to try a plate of barbecue! Hats off to the pit master!",

For drinks we had their homemade ginger beer, again DELICIOUS!   Before I forget if you want real fried chicken, this is the place to go!",

Of course they were busy on opening day but from the time I ordered to the time I picked up was very fast and the food was fresh. They also give discount if you work in the same shopping center! Decor is cute and staff were friendly/welcoming. As well as the owner.  First time I ordered the chicken thigh meal. Second time, I ordered chicken and waffles. The chicken was nice and crisp on the outside, juicy inside and not too greasy but I feel it needed more flavor. The mac n cheese was cheesy and creamy but needed more flavor as well. Coworker also agrees. The third time I went, I ordered shrimp and grits which was pretty good but very small portion for the price. Overall everything was good.   Their menu is a little on the pricey side. But I will continue to be a customer whenever i'm craving :)",

It's supposed to be brisket grilled cheese but I have picky eaters. I'm just shocked I paid $6.95 (plus tip) for half of a grilled cheese and about 10 fries. Watermelon soft serve was ok. The menu looks so good and I had planned on going back to sit down for a meal but now I just think it's way overpriced.  In response to the owner comment. My point was I didn't even get the brisket so maybe make a full sandwich or charge less? The staff was friendly but could have recognized this and accommodated.  I greatly appreciate your understanding. That's honestly all I wanted. I will look forward to dining in and trying some menu options.",

    "text": "So...First time here.  Had the pleasure to meet the owner and his girlfriend, Zach and Krista, spelled wrong I am sure!  The place was clean, comfortable and smelled amazing!     Wood burning smell.   ahhh..  The wait staff was also super friendly, MJ and Sabrina were their names and I think Ryan was the cook...   All very friendly...   So, Im trying to lose weight so I can meet my fave actress in a few weeks and Im pretty unhappy with my looks--I have lost 19 pounds so I asked for no meat with my mama's pan fried breakfast--Just eggs, hashbrowns and a biscuit and I also got a watermelon lemonade.  Delicious all around!        They also were able to give me extra eggs instead of the meat, The hash is amazing, its veggies like lima beans, peppers and corn with perfectly cooked potatoes..  the lemonade comes with a nice piece of watermelon and is cool and refreshing.     The biscuit is AMAZING...It comes with butter than I didnt even need to use!   So flavorful..  My ex took me there because I do not have a car and wanted to try it, I got him a lemonade as well which he loved and the hungry beef brisket, the ONLY reason I am giving them a 4 star review is because the HUNGRY brisket is only 4-5 pieces...Id be afraid of what the plenty brisket is--Be aware of that, its $22 for 5 pieces...and a small side of mac & cheese...  We usually go to Big B's and for the same price get a 3 meat combo w/2 sides and bread!     Portion sizes is actually making my ex run out to another place for a burger or something and we probably wont return even though it was good...    :/       I will be honest, my ex isnt HUGE, He is average and so are most of the people around and he is super hungry still, I would be too.   oh well, thanks for the experience!",

Seems like an unassuming restaurant in a generic outdoor shopping complex but this place is so much more than that. Southern themed food with breakfast all day. Fried chicken here is amazing!! Can get the chicken sandwich, chicken and waffles or a chicken platter. Portions are huge so go there with an empty stomach. The sides are delicious too esp the mac and cheese which is topped with some crushed saltines to give an added unique texture. Must come here if you are in the area!!",

Walking in also makes you wonder.. this place really serves deviled eggs and bbq brisket here !? Definitely a new meaning to a wow factor..   Ordered me the salt and pepper smoked brisket with a small side of sweet cream corn.. even though it was \"small\" it was a good enough portion for me and was well balanced with the brisket.. although I can eat.. i did have some of my wife's chicken and waffles.. which was also amazing!! But let's talk brisket.. soft as ever and ever so melting in my mouth meaning it was cooked perfectly for me.. it came with some bbq sauce and some butter.. and knowing how to eat southern food.. i put that butter on everything!! The onions and pickles on it was delicious!! (Wish they had put more!! - hint hint) and the bbq sauce just made it over the top!!   I can't wait to try out the other things they have on the menu..   ENJOY!",

    "text": "Cousins live not too far from here and told the story of the \"wait.\"   They've been waiting for this place to open, open, OPEN! And when it finally did, cousins ended up coming through for the first time with GodNiece and I... 3 months later.  Walked in on a Friday lunch and my party of 4 were the only customers. Decor is new and modern, a nice southern homely feel to it. We were nicely greeted by the cashier and since it was all our first, he did a quick rundown on how it's done. (Order up front and food will be delivered at the table you choose.)   The deviled eggs is supposedly a must try, so we got a couple of orders of those. For an entree, I got the chicken fried steak (gravy served on the side) and a thigh (since we GOTTA try the bird, right?!)   Deviled eggs were okay. (Yes, JUST okay.) If anything, the bacon elevated the taste (as it would any dish) but mediocre at best.   The side of fried chicken thigh was much better. Crunchy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside. The brine and batter is what really makes each bite. We all shared bites from this one piece and we collectively agreed we liked it. Definitely getting a chicken plate next time.   The chicken fried steak was bigger than I expected. (They did not go cheap on the meat.) The batter is similar (if not the same) as the chicken. Not necessarily a bad thing since it was still delicious. The gravy had perfect level of thickness and seasoning. The plate would have been close to perfect EXCEPT for the river of oil swimming on top of my eggs. It was a bit of a turnoff. I had to use my one napkin to wipe it off (see attached picture.)   FOOD: 3.5. Made to order is always a PLUS.  SERVICE: 4 VALUE: 5 PARKING: Shared with other businesses including a grocery store, but not an issue. You're bound to find plenty of spots open.  OVERALL: 4.   Great first run. Good recommendation by cuzzos!",

    "text": "Came into Mama Bird with a group of friends looking to check out the new venue. Cute little place. Was set on getting the chicken thighs but then when they ran out on the order before me I was sad. I like dark meat so that's what I had been dreaming about ordering. Ended up ordering the 3 piece chicken tenders with a side of creamed corn. One of my other diners ordered the coleslaw & we shared. I am glad they ran out of the thighs! When I saw them be delivered to one of my dining mates I had to giggle as they were pretty small & the tenders I ended up with were enough for 2 meals. Everything biscuits were great. Loved the creamed corn. Felt the cloeslaw needed a bit of seasoning. The chicken was extremely tender & the batter just the right amount of crisp.   My only bit of concern was while I was waiting for other diners to arrive I watched the waitress wiping off tables but the wash bucket was sitting on the floor next to the cabinet where water glasses are kept & everyone walks past to get to the restrooms or the pop dispenser. While waiting I did get up to use the restroom & walked past the bucket & it was filthy water. I understand wanting to keep the bucket handy but maybe inside the cabinet is a better option so people don't throw things into the bucket as they pass or just in general things floating in the air don't drop into it. It's been awhile since I've been in there so hopefully this has been addressed.   Overall really liked this place & Zach did a great job keeping everything rolling while we were there & tending to other patrons as well as our group. Look forward to going back again!",

Small but just enough seating and they have a cute little private booth in the back for like 6-8 small adults.   The menu is so intriguing I want to eat everything.  From Pimento cheese, chicken and waffle with Mac and cheese sandwich to ribs and shrimp and grits.   Momma Bird has all the comfort food to hit all the right spots!   Devil eggs were bomb and the candies jalapenos was really good. Bacon is not super crispy but very good.  Gravy and Everything biscuits with the side of honey butter and smoked sea salt was unexpectedly mind blowing. The gravy was killer had a thick yet runny texture which is hard to describe you just need to taste it to know what I'm talking about and the flavor Yummmm! The biscuit tho flaky buttery not just PERFECT!   The fried chicken and waffles is one of the best that I've had. Waffles were cool right with great density.  The dill ranch is so bomb was not sure about it but it's thick and it's good.   But what really stole the show for my was the Brisket Grill cheese we got off the kids menu. I had to steal that from my 3 year old. It was eyes roll to the. Ack of your head good.   All in all everything is finger licking good and like I said the food here hits all the right spots!!!",

My husband had the brisket hash with eggs and a biscuit... everything was delicious and definitely served on time...when in Vegas do try out Mama Bird you will not be disappointed",

    "text": "From the Southern places I've been to in Vegas, this place blows them out of the water. I really feel like I'm not exaggerating by calling this the best Southern food I've had out here by quite a wide margin.   Food: 5/5  Can we give it up for them for having Cheerwine? I haven't seen this anywhere in years! It was like running into an old friend, catching up on years past, and introducing it to my husband. His response was that he wouldn't drink any other soda if given the opportunity.   We had greens and cheese grits for sides. Both are fantastic! Clearly someone from the South made these sides. Sure enough, she was from New Orleans. When I wanted to decide which side, they let me sample the greens. There was pride handed to me with those greens, and there should have been.    The fried chicken is fantastic! Clearly on another level from most restaurants.... and let me not leave out the fact that they were nice enough to let us sample the sauces. All of them are great. My husband said that the Mama's Comeback reminded him of restaurant quality version of Cane's sauce. Hot Damn is made with ghost peppers, but it wasn't super hot to me. BBQ was solid. The Sweet Heat was my surprise pick for something I didn't think I'd like but did. The ranch is on another level here. Clearly made in house as they all are, but it's the first time I started to understand the ranch hype. Wow!  It was like \"Oh, this is what ranch is supposed to taste like.\"  The biscuit and maple butter was great! But the red velvet Oreo cake in a jar was amazing. Easily added to my favorite desserts in Vegas top 3.   Service: 5/5 They were so nice and accommodating!   Cleanliness: 5/5  When we were here, it was very clean, and tables were cleared quickly.  Decor: 5/5 Very homey feel, which I feel fits. It's more home cooking than restaurant-y. It's like your auntie that can cook made the food more than a chef. If that your idea of good eats, you'll love it.",

We started with the deviled eggs.  They should be called \"Slap-Your-Grandma-Amazing eggs\"!  Incredible!  I had the chicken sandwich with fries. The chicken was so well seasoned and oh so juicy!  My wife had the brisket grilled cheese, and she really enjoyed it!  The fries (perfectly fried and a mixture of crinkle-cut and sweet potato) had the most delectable seasoning!  And the dipping sauce?  YES PLEASE!  The sun tea and watermelon lemonade were also a real hit!  The price leaned toward the too pricey side of things, but the decor was homey and cute, the service was fantastic, and the food was incredible!  Go check it out!",

First of all I got setoff of how our order was taking, the waitress rudely stopped taking my order half way and turn her face away to her trainee, spoke to her for like 2 min explaining how things works, just left me stood there. 2ndly, we ordered coffees, it took them 15min brought out the coffee, after me reminding them at least that's what we could have whiling awaiting our food, but it came the worst part, 3 and half cups of cold coffee, literally! I asked the trainee is that how they typically serve breakfast coffee, she said sorry and she did not know coffee was cold, unbelievable.   After a while they realized I got pissed off and start to stop by to check things. All I am saying is it's a 4 and half stars place, it could have been way better than that for its service. No complain at all against the food, I hope my review helps to ones plan to stop by this place.",

    "text": "Our first time trying out Mama Bird, I think it was their fifth official day opened. It's a quick service so you order up front and a couple tables inside that you can seat at. We ordered the 3 chicken tenders with a side of cream corn and the brisket with a side of mac and cheese. The chicken tenders were tasty the breading had lots of flavor but the breading was a tad too thick maybe that it kept crumbling off the chicken, I still ate the crumbles off my plate though it was that good so I won't dock any stars for that. The cream corn was amazing I think it's my favorite dish. My husband had the brisket, that was melt in your mouth like butter, I kept stealing bites of his plate. The mac and cheese was good, it didn't blow my mind but it was a great side for the brisket. Now the everything biscuit is where we get serious - this is the best biscuit I've ever had, it has everything seasoning on it and the biscuit had cheese in it and it is huge! I did like the honest butter that came with it but I wish the honey was in butter so I would get an even ratio of both again this is just me nitpicking so I'm not taking off any stars for this neither. For dessert we got the watermelon soft serve, it was so refreshing and great for summer especially in this heat! We also got the Oreo red velvet cake in a jar, it was good but a little too rich for me, but my husband who loves sweets finished it all so that's that. Good price point for southern food, we will be back to try the ribs next time!",

The only complaint I have is that the service is a little slow, I believe there's only one cook (today). I'll definitely come back and recommend others to come too!",

It's a small restaurant that could easily be found in Brooklyn. They're counter service only, and the service each dish as it's ready.  I decided to try the Mac and cheese chicken tender waffle sandwich. The Mac and cheese was easily the best part of this dish. If I had ordered just that, I would have been happy. I was extremely disappointed when the sandwich was ready and I noticed some sort of sauce on it. I don't like almost any condiments, and this was not in the sandwich description. This meant that I had to wipe off parts of the sandwich and take it apart. The chicken was okay. It tasted a little like Cane's. The waffle was super bland. I didn't even eat it.  I also ordered the biscuit, which was okay, but I wouldn't order it again. It needs to be a little fluffier and have more flavor. The butter on the side is really just butter with a drizzle of honey on it, not True honey butter.  My dining companion ordered the brisket grilled cheese. She loved it. Again, we didn't realize that the brisket was barbecued with sauce. I took a bite and instantly regretted it. She loves barbecue sauce, so she was happy. The bread on this sandwich was great!  Overall, I left feeling unsatisfied. I can't say I'll be back, but it might be a good place for some.",

Edit: It had nothing to do with \"not fast enough for my liking\", The guy told me he was getting my eggs ready and he did indeed get eggs ready and then gave them to the grub hub driver. My food was sitting right there, he put me aside for the grub hub and that's not the first time this happened at this establishment. Last time was about six months ago, I was sitting there dining In, my food took over forty minutes to get to me while I watched drivers walk in and out with their food, same driver different orders. Mama bird needs a kitchen JUST for grub hub take out, you may wait for nearly an hour while grub hub orders get filled. I tried it again today, as take out and I see it does not matter, Mama birds priority is not customers In the building, it's grub hub. Waste of time.",

    "text": "It's been awhile since I lived in Las Vegas and I always loved supporting and going to local eateries. The last time I went to Vegas I had heard about a new local spot serving up southern comfort food. I made my way to Mama Bird, just a short 15 minutes from the Strip in Southern Highlands. Great for lunch after a long night of drinking or just to come and get a big meal. Portions are big and definitely order a few items to share and the staff is super friendly providing that southern hospitality.  We ordered the Salt & Pepper Brisket Grilled Cheese Sandwich with sweet potato fries. The sandwich is served on Texas toast with pimento cheese and they don't skimp on the cheese, brisket or flavor! and the dipping sauce that comes with it is awesome. We also ordered the 2 piece friend chicken plate (you can get it with tenders, thigh meat or breast meat) and it comes with an everything buttermilk biscuit and your choice of side (we got the apple dixie cole slaw, although next time I want to try the Mac n cheese or white cheddar grits). The chicken was moist and the batter wasn't too thick as it is on other fried chicken I've had. For dessert you have to get the watermelon soft serve which is served between a watermelon slice.   Mama Bird is a great addition to the local flavor in Vegas. They also make their own hot sauces, teas and ginger beers. Will definitely have to try their BBQ plate next time I am in town. If you live in Vegas or just visiting, definitely check out Mama Bird for some down home southern comfort food. And if you don't feel like driving there, you can always get it delivered!",

    "text": "This has got to be the one of the best Boutique home style cooking & BBQ in Vegas.   I was told this is a must try so I wandered over to a part of town I don't usually Visit to take a crack at it.  We came hungry and that was a good thing and a bad thing because everything on the menu looked amazing because the place smelled amazing.  My GF and I decided to ask what they suggested and I'm glad we went with their suggestions so I would like to thank the staff about that.   The Hardest part was eating things in the traditional order of appetizer, main course then desert so I'm going to skip that part.  1. Wicked Deviled Eggs W/Candied jalapeno & Bacon:  The Candied Toppings are out of this world.  Ask them how much time they spend doing this and you will appreciate it that much more.   Next time I'm Ordering 6 instead of 4.  2. Mac N' Cheese Chicken Tender Waffle Sandwich & Side Of North & South Fries: ENORMOUS.  My GF loves anything Mac N' Cheese.  The Waffle part just added to it.   This was my favorite part of the meal as it was so large and my GF just went all in.  How she finished it all I have no idea.   3. Salt & Pepper Brisket Grilled Cheese Sandwich & a side of sliced Watermelon Soft Serve:  I can never turn down anything With Brisket And this is no exception.  It was Perfect balance of not to much salt fat or butter.  It was amazing.  If you enjoy Brisket you would love this but next time I may try the 12oz Brisket plate so I can enjoy even more of this tender cut of meat!  The Watermelon side I couldn't stay away from so I was having a bite off and on during my meal.  The Side Of Mac N' Cheese was so good.  I'm glad I ordered it so I could try it as my GF wouldn't share hers.  4. Liam's (Non-Alcoholic) Ginger Beer:  Ironically Liam was there so how could I say no to the guy in charge of creating the perfectly balanced and not to sweet or overpowering ginger beer beverage on a hot day.  His story on how he got it on the menu is great so if he's there feel free to ask.   I got the strawberry flavor so my GF could also enjoy so I got the large bottle to take home.  Next time I'm going with his favorite the jalapeno flavor! *You Get $1 off your next bottle if you return the Original Large Bottle  5. Hummingbird Cake Jar (Banana + Pineapple + Pecan + Coconut + Cream cheese Frosting): I'm so happy these are small because I couldn't stop eating it.  Not to sweet but sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth.    6. Oreo Red Velvet Cake Jar (Oreos + Chocolate Chips + Cream Cheese Frosting):  This was my GF's favorite part of the Meal that she devoured before we ate, talked or received our meal *Which Took about 5min. To get. (I purchased an extra one to take home, when you return the jar you get $.50 off the next purchase)  I can't wait To go back and try different Items.   100% worth the drive.  If you come here and have something that's a must try please let me know.  The place was extremely clean front to back including the restrooms.  It made me think this restaurant had just opened even though it has been open for a while.   Thanks again can't wait to return!  PS:  What I loved the most was the fact they don't use a lot of salt and nothing I ate was too overpowering.  I was full when I left but I felt fine, as I was expecting to be in a painful food coma because I ate so much.  Simply amazing for this type of food!!!",

Best southern food I have found on the west coast. The staff was super friendly.  And Raheem was very helpful and very friendly. The portion were a good size. I had the half rack of ribs and brisket. Which was so tender. The meat just fell of the bone on the ribs.Even the biscuits were good and I normally don't like them. The deviled eggs were a suprise how tasty they were with the pickled jalapeno and bacon piece. We all order a different meal and they were all delicious. Great presentation and had plenty of leftovers.  I stongly recommend this place to anyone that loves southern food. We live on the North side of Las Vegas, but it was definitely worth the drive.",

So it's been a few months since my last review and still nothing has changed. Nevertheless, I won't go back again. I've always given them 5 stars on the food and customer service, but this time my food was mediocre at best. I ordered the half slab of ribs and they were over cooked. I couldn't eat all of it because the meat was too tough. I waited about 55 mins for a pick up order and the fried green beans were lukewarm just like I suspected them to be. I did ask if my order had been sitting for a while, and I was reassured that it wasn't, but my food should have been a lot warmer considering that I only live 2 minutes away. I love the concept of this restaurant given that I'm southern and it's hard to find quality souther restaurants. Unfortunately, I've been let down too many times.",

We also tried the fried green beans and the spice of the batter paired with the coolness of the creamy sauce served with it was magic. Don't forget to try the watermelon lemonade... SO REFRESHING!!",

With the grilled cheese, it comes with a choice of sweet potato fries and crinkled fries or you can mix both.    All the flavors complimented each other. I also ordered the spicy green beans and that was really good too with the dill ranch dip. I'm excited to find out that this place is just down the street and I'll probably be coming here on Wednesday's here since I'm a big fan of waffles. This place has waffle Wednesday deals for 5 bucks in the morning!  I'll most likely be back here. Service was great. Can not complain one bit.",

It has a warm feeling when you enter, you can smell the flavors, and sometimes it is hard to make a selection.  I love the chicken and waffles personally but my wife enjoys the brisket.  The best part is we are able to order a few things and create our own picnic.  Seating can be tough at times, so it is often better for takeout. The service is on point though, and I love it when we can sit down and relax.",

We placed our order and the employees were friendly and helpful. We spent about 45 minutes there sitting and eating next to tables that were never cleared even though no other customers came in and there seemed to be employees available to do so. The food was fine but nothing spectacular and not quite worth the price tag. We will try again sometime and hope to update my review with better stars.",

This quaint farm house style restaurant serves a variety of southern favorites including fried chicken, chicken & waffles, mac & cheese, brisket, ribs, and sandwiches. We stopped in for brunch today and as we walked in, we were immediately greeted by the friendly staff at the counter. I ordered the chicken & waffles with scrambled eggs and my boyfriend ordered the smoked brisket hash with over easy eggs. In addition, we ordered a small mac & cheese and an everything biscuit with honey butter to share. The restaurant is set up so that you order at the counter and seat yourself. Once we sat down, we were surprised how fast our food came out. We didn't even wait long at all. What also impressed us was the food. The portions are huge! We found everything to be extremely delicious and flavorful. I especially loved how the fried chicken was juicy yet crispy on the outside. My boyfriend also enjoyed his brisket hash.   I definitely have to agree that this place lives up to its Yelp reviews with their delicious food. The staff are courteous and always greets you with a smile.

As ridiculous as that is I thought to try again. This time at the crazy late dinner time of 7:00 PM. Eager to try both the chicken and ribs I have heard good things about, I placed my rib order only to be told \"we are all out of ribs and brisket\". A proclaimed \"Southern Kitchen\" that's out of ribs and brisket?!?! Clearly these folks have never been to the south.  I hope to update my review once I can actually get food- I do hear it's tasty.

But if you go, make sure to try the fried green beans; you won't regret it! They also have a great staff that provides friendly service.  Furthermore, I contracted Ma'ma Birds to cater my mother's wedding rehearsal dinner. They did an impeccable job. Food was the same high-standard as though we were eating in its dining room, delivery was right on time (plus or minus a minute), and it even gave us two complementary jugs of ginger beer. Staff assisted in the buffet setup and ensured we were satisfied with the product before leaving.   I would highly recommend their catering to anyone in the need thereof.",

Chicken fried steak is the measuring stick for a breakfast spot and they nailed it, gravy not too thick but still sumptuous and the thin steak breaded to perfection but not overly bready and dry. Smoked pork belly and a thin waffle to rival roscoes we're just some of the other options we took down today and everything was tremendously satisfying. I'm a very large man, the boy can eat, and I am STUFFED.   Get the sweet tea. Leave a review and get the free dessert cuz that's bomb too. Like everything is for real delicious. Southern cooking that's better than my own.",

Crisp on chicken has even flavors, not greasy perfect crisp, chicken just falls apart. Brisket was cubed not shredded, flavor was great smoked flavor, not dry at all, very moist. Ribs coming right off the bone perfect amount of sauce not dripping off or messy, smoked just right. Coleslaw has great taste the apple is crunchy. Overall worth price and for southern cooking on point. Taste like southern cooking from Arkansas and Texas the owner has done a great job... definitely be back for some more and try the collard greens and breakfast..",

    "text": "Mama Bird marks the third breakfast establishment to enter into the Southern Highlands area.  The reigning champ, Rise and Shine, is still King.   Mama Bird is order at the counter fast casual featuring southern comfort food.    Beautifully appointed in Southern Charm, but it lacked in flavor and is highest priced of all the breakfast places nearby.  Starting a restaurant isn't easy.  Having sold into the industry for a few years, I'm familiar with the operational side and the complexities of scouting locations and making a competitive bid for your breakfast dollar.    I don't think the owners thought it thAny other location and Mama Bird would have seen better success.  We ordered the chicken fried steak and the chicken in waffles.  I ordered my eggs over easy.  Bland gravy.  The chicken fried steak was poorly cooked and over done.  And it arrived without toast for the eggs.  I had to add it to the order for $2.71.  Two piece of toast for nearly $3.00, folks.  Let that sink in.  Here's something else - iHop chicken fried steak is much much better.  IHOP is better.  The chicken and waffles arrived with an over cooked waffle.  The waffle was hard.  For the overall cost of $45 including tip, it wasn't definitely not worth the cost or the experience.  Update:  Ok, so I just read Zach's response and I have to admit that it explains much.  The menu assumes a lot in understanding Southern cuisine - now it makes sense - mea maxima mea culpa.  Furthermore, it also takes a standup guy to respond to a critical review.  Hats off to you Zach, I always try for an honest review.  When I come back, I'll coordinate with you so you can walk me through the highlights.",

    "text": "Talk about straight LEGIT and tasty Southern food. I have been meaning to check this place out for sometime. The more pictures see the more items want all get in. I made sure brought my appetite post workout so could get in as much of the menu. Just me impressed waitress got it all in. Lol.  My first impression was for small restaurant the place has personality. The counter area soon as walk in interesting cause first think more of ramen/noodle shop. When look all around screams southern style from the tables and the interior decor. Counter area cool got to see magic happen with the food. The chefs in the back were friendly asking about food and engaging. Lot of times opposite. That area blessing cause when the place gets packed happens quick cause hold less 30 maybe. I liked all these jars on counter from desserts, signature candied jalapeno, or even sell dog treats. The lemonades and sweet teas fresh everyday. The watermelon lemonade was refreshing!  Food I ordered the Salt Pepper Brisket Grilled cheese sandwich. Also add fried egg off waitress recommendation. OMG. Not only was that great call. By far the best and creative grilled cheese sandwich ever! Not only did it have all of things love about grilled cheese sandwich. The brisket had ton of flavor, moist, and easy could have bowl of brisket be happy. U get some of that cream yolk porn perfect compliment all the flavors. The bread they use nice thick cuts. So so so good. The fries got mention combination sweet and crinkle cut beautiful. The dipping sauce addicting. Also got order Devil Eggs. The combination of savory bacon, candy jalapeno, filling, and perfect boiled egg. Seriously FULL yolk porn. Lol! Absolutely the best Devil Eggs in Vegas!!!!  The service five stars!! The moment walked in warm welcome, whole staff engaging, and True southern hospitality!",

    "text": "Yes, yes, yes. This is how you run a restaurant folks, other local restaurants take note.   Every detail here from the decor, staff, menu and of course the food, the delicious food was spot on!   This a casual spot where you sit anywhere you'd like, order and pay at the counter and they bring the food out to you when it's ready. There's a water station where you grab a glass and fill up your own water. We ordered way too much because everything looked so good and the prices were approachable.  The only teenie, tiny mistake here was lipstick on one of the water glasses but I know from working in restaurants and also wearing lipstick that this happens from time to time. Staff just needs to check for this when setting out the glasses.   But seriously everything else was awesome. Here's what we ordered and how we felt about it.   Deviled Eggs w/ candied jalapenos & bacon- A, will order again Spicy Green Beans- A- fried perfectly, not too spicy, good dipping sauce on the side, likely order again Collared Greens side- B+ good, I mean they're greens so if you feel like you need veggies in your life, get them, if not, order an extra biscuit instead Biscuit- A- homemade, baked perfectly, delicious, will order again Mac & Cheese- B+, cheesy, good, didn't blow me away but still good Pecan Smoked Ribs-A - delicious! The bbq sauce was also awesome.   P.s. we've ordered take out from here twice since dining in and the food holds up! So good.",

We started off with the \"wicked deviled eggs\" and they didn't disappoint , they tasted great and had candied jalapeno and bacon on top! The watermelon lemonade was delicious and refreshing! Fried chicken & waffles is a BIG meal and will fill you up, the chicken is crispy, the waffle is made or corn meal and is sweat together they make a great pair!

Their dishes are a little pricey but as you can see in the pictures, each plate has large portions. There were plenty of tables open when we came around 11:30am.  The deviled eggs were just okay. It comes with candied jalapenos and bacon jam. I had the fried bologna sandwich and surprisingly it was pretty good. I really wanted to try the Watermelon Soft Serve but I was too full with everything else we had ordered. Im not sure if I would return in the near future, but if you go, I recommend trying the ribs!",

Mama Bird is clear across town but has a large menu with a lot of great dishes from barbecue to fried chicken, and they also promote their catering. Love the vibes here, hoping they eventually expand for another, closer location.  PROS: This cafe is super cute, love the homey aesthetic. Menu has a lot of my favorites, and food was tasty- brisket grilled cheese and mac and cheese were good, as is the shrimp and grits. Food tastes authentic to southern cuisine, some portions are fairly large (sandwiches), making this a good spot to share a few dishes with a friend. On both visits, I was checked on by staff. They also sell Liam's ginger beer that I'll eventually try, along with pimento cheese.   CONS:  Pricing is kind of all over the place. Portions for sandwiches are sharable, so $15 with with fries is fair but the shrimp and grits was tiny for the $8.50 price- wish they offered this as a larger entree topped with blackened shrimp for $12-15. Pricing could come down for the deviled egg app and biscuit, too. Friends  decided against ordering the fried chicken when they realized it was boneless, which we found odd. Tables on both visits sat needing to be cleared longer than expected.   This spot is quite a drive for me but I have recommended it to friends who live closer. Come in to share a few things, and don't forget to use the Yelp check-in offer for the free watermelon sorbet!",

My have-to-get here is the sweet cream corn, spicy friend green beans, anything with fried chicken in it and the watermelon lemonade or any ginger beer.   This time, I did the Mac n'cheese chicken tender waffle sandwich. The fried chicken is so well seasoned and juicy. Also, it is bigger than my face, which should always be the answer to \"how much fried chicken do you want.\"  I'm working my way through the whole menu, so I'll update more once I eat more lol",

    "text": "A multigenerational child of the south, I cannot tell y'all how excited I was to finally try this place! A long drive for us, we decided our daughter's 14th bday was the perfect day to go. We got there just before 11am and was a bit surprised by the lack of customers on a Saturday morning. We had a choice of tables and chose one outside which, despite the heat, offered a nice breeze thru the walkway just down from Albertsons, between an Aveda's and a smoke shop.   My southern DNA demands \"if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all!!\" However, I was raised to be honest. So, in that spirit, my single biscuit was amazing. Do not expect a basket of them (found in every southern restaurant I've ever eaten in) because they charge $2.50 each!!! Think a Red Lobster Cheddar Bay biscuit (with extra cheese) topped with Trader Joe's Everything But the Bagel seasoning. Absolutely loved it but will NOT make the 45 minute trip just to eat one...  Our birthday girl's chicken tenders and mac n cheese were liked by her with the latter being the favorite of the two. She did question the crunched up saltines on top though. Lol.   I'm glad I wasn't hardly hungry a bit so the tiny little bowl of shrimp and cheddar grits were just right. The big lumps in the grits reminded me of mama's! (Mama wasn't known for her culinary skills)  My husband is a Yankee and his most favorite breakfast is biscuits and gravy. Having sampled both Northern and Southern varieties, he said he had tasted worse but had never been served biscuits and gravy soup before today.   We tried the watermelon lemonade. Adults not impressed at all. The one watermelon item we especially drove all this way for - the watermelon soft serve - was, well, let's just say the soft serve machine was having a bad day. Not fortuitous in July. In Las Vegas.   All in all, we could have spent a whole lot less, gotten better value and enjoyed the food even more at Cracker Barrel - except for that biscuit. Maybe it's just my southern embedded thriftiness but spending almost $70 on breakfast for the three of us with the only stand out a little biscuit?  Service? Almost as slow as Christmas seems coming to a selfish child. Don't wait for menus, silverware, water or salt and pepper. Y'all are expected, but not told, to wait on your own darn self.   One last thing - don't expect a single, solitary drop of southern charm or hospitality - which was a cryin' shame. Like my southern grandma always said: you never get a second chance to make a first impression...\"",

Not that I don't love Rise and Shine but, it's nice to have options lol  Love the vibes in there but, fairly small space.  My friends group of 4 plus baby fit snug in the corner but, love for the food made up for the tight space.   I got the fried green beans (I'm in a green bean phase at the moment) and ginger beer. Friends got the country fried steak and chicken and waffles. I didn't get to sample their food but, they thoroughly enjoyed their food. Saying the chicken was moist and there was a good tasting breading in the chicken. My girlfriend found their chicken fried steak to be her new fave with a nice gravy that goes with it.  I, actually, really loved the fried green beans. It came with a ranch sauce but didn't need it as the breading on it was enough flavor. It was perfect amount for me to much on, reminded me of fries :)",

    "text": "The food here was incredible. 5/5 stars hands down. I had the 5 chicken tenders with mac & cheese on the side. The chicken had just a perfect layer of crispy skin, not too breaded or oily. The insides were sooooo juicy. One bite and I already knew it was the best fried chicken I've ever had. The mac & cheese was delectable and I can venture to say it was also one of the best mac & cheese I've ever tasted. The portion for the chicken tenders was exceptionally generous. 5 pieces..? looked more like the whole damn chicken!   We also ordered other items like the pit master scramble. I judged a book by its cover and when it came out I thought it looked like your typical scramble mush -- throw some cool ingredients together and hope for the best. nope! The flavors went together perfectly and the pork belly was cooked to perfection.   Now, with such a sterling review on the food...why am I giving it 3 stars? I judge a restaurant by the whole experience and not just the food.I was very dissatisfied with the service although every waiter was very courteous. They just have a broken process (can't rly blame the waiter for that ...or can you?)   TLDR: long wait despite half empty restaurant, served wrong food, forgot to serve us appetizer til we were done, came to this restaurant specifically for their watermelon boat/soft serve (was served without a boat bc \"we were taking it to go\" -- which we NEVER said....did not re-serve it correctly)  I would come back again despite the lackluster service. The food was outstanding, I will give them a second chance to hopefully redeem themselves.",

I've ordered food from here on more than one occasion and both times I was disappointed by either missing items, undercooked eggs, and sometimes both.    I'd recommend Rise & Shine, which is owned by the same family!  The food is fresh, flavorful, and never disappoints!  Moreover, they're prices are MUCH more reasonable and the portions are very generous!  Bottom line...Mama Bird and Rise & Shine (owned and run by the same family) offer delicious food, made with LOVE.  Support your local, small business and give them a try.  You will NOT be disappointed, unless your country fried steak arrives ketchup instead of their HOMEMADE sausage gravy...or you didn't get the AMAZING \"pot of bread\" you ordered...or your eggs aren't fully cooked - but you can't deny that undercooked won't stop you from eating them.    Stop in and enjoy.  They are a family oriented business that treats their customers like family.  They aren't always perfect, but no one is.  Just give them a heads up if something is missing.  ;)  Meanwhile, I stand by my review.  You can now send an instant message across the planet through social media, so I have a difficult time understanding what happens when an order that is relayed (within the few feet of distance) between the dining area and kitchen is made incorrectly.",

Also, and I was surprised, but the wings are probably the best I've had in Vegas. Smoked then battered then fried.

I brought my friend with me to try this place. She loves to eat like me, but she's a very picky eater. We both ordered the Fried Chicken Tenders with potato salad. I also ordered a ginger beer. I couldn't eat the potato salad because of the poppy seeds and onions--I looked like the picky eater that day! The chicken was tender and flavorful, but there was a little too much batter for me. I ate the meat and left some of the fried batter on the plate. I gave the biscuit to my friend to take home and finished the ginger beer. Needless to say, I left somewhat hungry. I'll have to try something else from the menu next time.",

A quick yelp search, and \"Mama Bird\" popped up. It about a 5 minute drive south of the strip so we decided to give it a try. Parking was amazingly spacious since it's in a shopping center, and free.  The workers are all friendly, the atmosphere is welcoming and the food... is phenomenal.  This trip to Vegas I was apparently on a chicken and waffles vibe and this has to be up there with the best I've ever had.  Cornmeal waffles, great. Eggs and watermelon, check. Deliciously fried chicken breast, yum. Sweetened sun tea to wash it all down, refreshing.  Fast and friendly service, doesn't get any better.  If you need somewhere to eat and you don't mind a short drive away from all the headache of the Vegas strip, try Mama Bird out, they're rated 4.5-5 stars for a reason and you won't be disappointed.",

The decor leads to an Instagram feel, but not overwhelming cliche either.  Any southern cooking restaurant should know how to make sweet tea. I speak from more than a two decade experience in the South and I tip my hat to Mama Bird for that sweet tea. One sip brought me back home.  I will give them props on the portion sizes, but that may be because I chose a monstrosity of a plate, the fried chicken mac and cheese waffle sandwich. It was delicious. The chicken was seasoned really well and the mac and cheese was tasty too. The waffle didn't stand a chance though. I attempted, but it broke after the second bite. My wife got the fried chicken salad which was served in a colander. See what I mean about the Instagram feel? She said the same about the chicken.  We also got an order of pimento cheese, bacon jam, and their deviled eggs. Even though they pride themselves on the deviled eggs, I was less than impressed. What I do want more of is that bacon jam!

Mama Bird is definitely a spot I can proudly recommend. I ordered the 2-piece boneless thigh plate, which came with an Everything Biscuit plus one \"small\" side of my choice. First comment to make--small is misleading. The serving of mac and cheese was *too* generous, but at least that means I have leftovers!   The Everything Biscuit is good, but even better with the complimentary honey butter. The fried boneless thighs were juicy and fantastic--unlike dried pieces that I've had from other establishments.   I decided to order a Watermelon Lemonade and have no regrets. It's the perfect summer beverage without being too sweet! They also offer hand-crafted ginger beers (non-alcoholic) in three flavors, but that will have to be for another visit.   To finish things off, I enjoyed a unique Watermelon Soft Serve! Don't know where else I can get this!  Props to the friendly staff for providing all this satisfying food. I'm really glad this place opened and can't wait to visit again!",

    "text": "I was a little nervous coming in to the restaurant, because we have a 2 1/2 year old, and a 1 year old, but since the reviews said \"kid friendly\" I thought we'd give it ago. I was extremely pleased with the relaxed atmosphere. Our kids behaved, but it was just nice that we could enjoy our food! I feel that this is very family friendly, and each staff member that we came in contact with, was very friendly and accommodating! The kids' menu is only 2 items- chicken tenders with macaroni and cheese or chicken tenders with French fries. But honestly, sometimes restaurants over complicate kids' menus. It was nice, because we just got one of each for our kids. I expected like an \"easy Mac\" version of macaroni, with it being the kids menu, and all, but it was amazing, homestyle macaroni, that my picky son devoured! My daughter loved it, too! He also LOVED the chicken tenders. My husband has the mac n cheese chicken tender waffle sandwich (I had a bite...oh my yum!) and I had the brisket sweet potato hash! The biscuit and specialty butter that came with are the items that put that dish over the top in my book!   I also stole a few bites of my kids' chicken tenders (you know, for quality control purposes ) and my son asked for some ranch. I believe I spoke to a manager (he was the one that came out and asked how we were doing- a younger guy, with glasses...very nice!) and he said they have a house made dill ranch. It's not your traditional runny, store bought Ranch, so my son wasn't a fan, but I had it and I wish I could put that on everything!   Finally, we had the watermelon soft serve for dessert. I had read about it, and thought it was going to be overly sweet like most sorbets are. But this was not the case at all! It was light, simple, and satisfying! 3 ingredients that make it taste so fresh, and not overcomplicated!   This restaurant focuses on True flavor, and bringing out delicious flavors with fresh ingredients to compliment some amazing recipes.  We will definitely be back, because there are a few other items on the menu that I would like to try, and I NEED to try the ginger beer when I come back!   I didn't catch anyone's names, unfortunately, but everyone gave stellar service! Thank you all!",

You walk it and wonder where the rest of the tables are. Then after quite the wait, you're met even more disappointing food. Even My toddler (who lives of chicken nuggets and Mac n cheese) hardly wanted to eat her meal. My eggs and \"bacon\" were hardly cooked and the rest of the food was just way over seasoned.

Went in there twice and the first time 2 teenagers really did not care to take my order or bother helping me until I asked. Normal non work related chatter, very unprofessional   Second time, the cooks we're more helpful that the cashier or whatever you want I call her. Rude and unconcerned that I was there. On both occasions both cashiers did not know how to use the simple terminal to take orders or pay for my order.   I really do like this place and I hope it lasts at this location. But service is the forefront of your business and the service has been negative so far. But, once again the food is awesome",

The breakfast options are very minimal and for the price you pay, it's not worth it ($50 for 2 plates!).  I got the Country Fried Steak \"breakfast plate\" and it came fried chicken, two eggs, and the gravy on the side with a slice of watermelon. I had to order the everything biscuits separately ( which were very dry and honey butter very little to help it) - no potatoes or anything.  The taste was ok - nothing great.  Also got the chicken and waffles.  Waffle not thick or fluffy at all - and the chicken on top was mostly breaded.    You pick up the food yourself from where you ordered the food ( no table service) and when there is a line to order, it's very crowded ( as it's a small place).  You have to reach over other people with these huge plates to get your food and bring to the table.  They only serve Instant Coffee which they have you make yourself - very disappointed and with this experience I do not want to return to even try the other food options.",

The grits were excellent though.  But it's very bad \"southern\" food and it's highly overpriced.   Save yourself the experience and try somewhere else.",

With the space they were given, they were able to plan their theme accordingly and not make the place feel congested. Customer service was great and the employees were able to provide personal favorites as well as accommodate to our preference in food. The boneless thigh was great and the collard greens left me reminiscing about my childhood. Overall a great place to be in and dine.",

However, everything that we've had thus far has been delicious. We usually get the fried chicken with a side and then we order another side as well. The chicken is amazing tender and juicy with the perfect amount of crisp on the outside. The macaroni is a new favorite of mine. The grits are full of flavor, I added butter and sugar to mine. I personally think the prices are reasonable. My husband and I get two pieces of chicken and two sides for about $20. It's a delicious easy option for us on nights would where we are both too tired to cook but want a home style meal.",

We both had the Smoked Brisket Hash the flavors were electric and Taylor picked the way the eggs were made for me sunny side up. The textures in the hash really made the dish. Man the biscuits with cheese inside that came with it are legit!! This place is a must stop. The dairy free watermelon soft serve tastes like a real watermelon...holy schnozberries!

Upon a very kind greeting you feel the positive energy of the staff and chefs.  When I sat down you could hear people down the line saying \"this is delicious!\"  Nice portions and clever presentation.    Mama Bird is homestyle comfort-food featuring expertly-fried chicken and all kinds of customized, southern-inspired delicacies. This is the kind of place to make your family's weekly tradition for breakfast lunch or dinner.    We ordered the southern fried chicken sandwiches, the two-piece fried chicken, mac & cheese, cream corn and biscuits.  Don't forget the deviled eggs with candied jalapenos and bacon.  The watermelon dessert is divine and a refreshing compliment.  My wife loves the Oreo red velvet cake jar.    My compliments to this excellent family owned business.  We will be back.",

Not only is this the only place in Vegas that doesnt give refills of some .02 cent tea, they bring a 100% sweet tea to us of which we state we didnt order that and then the waitress proceeds to argue with us about it...a tea!!!!  Then she states we can just have that one so my partner is choking it down but my unsweet tea never comes.  So i get up and ask for it.  The rude waitress brings it and then takes back the one tea she said we can have.  Our whole table was like WTF!!! Concerning the food...its average at best.  They serve an everything biscuit at this Southern style place.  Ive been all throughout the south, never seen that, plus the biscuit was dry.  Not ever going back and dont recommend you do either.

Yelling his greeting, telling jokes, singing , talking to the other employees, etc. I think he was trying to give the place a fun and friendly vibe, but it just made it a really unpleasant experience. We had a hard time ordering over him loudly greeting a new guest and singing to the music. We had to pause our conversation at our table several times to wait for him to be done speaking behind us. We got the biscuits and gravy and skillet. Both had really sterile, not at all \"southern cooking\" flavors. Pretty bland. I loaded the gravy up with pepper but it was still missing something. The biscuits were just okay. The skillet ridges made it really hard to eat that dish and it lacked flavor as well. The deviled eggs were good. We wouldn't go back.",

The food is really good!  I had chicken strips (very large and tender) with a biscuit, and their spin on coleslaw which had a touch of apple to it, and their pie in a jar.  Everything they serve has their own signature added to it, so you don't feel like you are getting the same thing you can get at any other restaurant.  The food and restaurant definitely have that southern flair. The restaurant is nicely decorated too.  They are a little pricey, but you do get what you pay for.  I'll be back again.",

    "text": "Update: We still give this the same rating several months later. We thought at first they were going through growing pains so we have it another shot. This place has a case of lost identity. It's very small and limited choices so seems like a to-go place; however the first time we went it took 20 minutes and this time it took 30 minutes for our to-go order! We had groceries waiting in our car and it looked like they were fufilling catering orders. With chicken as 90% of the menu, they should have it down. Also they went on about the sauce for the chicken and then forgot to put it in the bag. The good news is that the chicken strips were huge but the bad news is the chicken and waffle was less food and more expensive. (Side note - B health rating also shows the place might not entirely have it together). We were so excited about this place but sadly won't be going back. We rewrite this review not to be rude but to give honest feedback in hopes the local business will fix these issues to stay around.",

Ordered basically almost the same thing as us, and for some reason they got the food first. I stayed quiet and didn't say anything. So when we finally get our order the cook or whatever she was said sorry it took so long, thank you for your patience, but the eggs took a while to get just right. I got mines over easy, and my girlfriend got hers over medium. They both were almost fully cooked, so I went and told them about the eggs, they fixed them supposably. The lady comes out and tells us one of the eggs broke, so I didn't want it to go to waste so she brought it out to us. Honestly I would never come back to this spot to eat, and I'm not the kind that will come to a business and put down negative comments based on them. But it's a straw free restaurant, overpriced for shitty quality their gravy is bagged up, the country fried chicken had too much flower or whatever. You have to get up order your food, serve yourself some water, go up to them and ask them if they can put ice in the cup. And when your food is ready they don't even bring it to you, you have to get up and pick it up yourself unless if they mess up on your eggs!",

The breading was very flavorful and crispy. Waffle was great, too. My girlfriend ordered the Smoked Pork Belly and Grits. The pork belly flavor was amazing and the grits were cooked perfectly along with her 2 over-medium eggs. We got an everything biscuit with honey butter to share. The biscuit was light and flaky and the honey butter was a perfect compliment. We also ordered LGB ginger beers which were awesome! They have different flavors to choose from. We ordered the strawberry and the original lime flavors. They came served in copper mugs. The only reason for 4 out of five stars is that I feel they should have someone bring your order out to your table when it's ready. Everything came out at different times which requires you to get up each time to go and retrieve your food. I don't mind ordering at the counter, but they should consider bringing it out to you. The staff was extremely friendly, however and very helpful. We'll definitely be back...",

Not sure about those seeds on top of a biscuit though! More importantly the fried chicken NEEDS TO BE CHANGED! Never in my life have I heard of a \"Southern\" restaurant serving all boneless chicken with an excessive amount of thin flaky buttermilk fry crust! In addition to that, there was absolutely no taste from this chicken! Please Mama Bird, learn to season and fry real chicken with bones! Fried chicken with no bones is not fried chicken. The bone gives chicken flavor! Otherwise, you're just eating some bland, flaky chicken tender that is basically bar food. With that being said, I will return to try the bbq ribs along with other items. But never those tasteless chicken tenders again until it changes to real Southern fried chicken! Thank you!",

    "text": "Came here excited, wanting to support a newly opened restaurant that is literally within walking distance and with a big appetite, however I left with a big dent in my wallet and disappointment.   The great things about this restaurant:  1. Nice and cool AC 2. Friendly staff 3. Cute decor 4. Great Liam's Ginger Beer Soda  Sadly those were the only good points regarding the restaurant.   1. Appetizer/Snack      I ordered the \"Big Ol' Watermelon Wedge\" that comes somewhat precut, with honey-lime. If the kitchen is going to precut something, make sure it is actually so. The watermelon was scored on the side thinking it was cut, but when I tried to pick it up (and the other table that I shared my snack with), it was still stuck to the rind. With it being watermelon season, you would expect the watermelon to be sweet. This was not the case. The honey helped, but not by much. The acid from the lime wedge wasn't enough to elevate it, but by adding a sprinkling of salt provided on the table, it helped tie everything together. Also, the snack came after I was over 50% done with my entree didn't help matters either.  2. Entree      With the name Mama Bird, you would think I would order their specialty: chicken. By how the cashier talked up the salt and pepper smoked brisket, I chose to go with that. An entree comes with their everything biscuit and 1 small side. Going once again with the cashier's suggestions, I asked for their mac n' cheese. The brisket was tender, but not the most tender I've come across. It's hard to explain how once bite could come up with three different textures: tender, not so tender, dry. I've had brisket so tender, that not even the sharpest knife could provide a clean cut, but being they were even able to do should give proof that it is not as tender as it can be.       Everything Biscuit with a side of honey butter, was not the best example I've ever eaten. The outer part of the bottom of the biscuit was very was crisp, almost close to being burnt but not quite. I enjoyed the crispness, but the inside of said such biscuit was dry and not fluffy. Great flavor with the everything bagel spice that is on the top of the biscuit where it is sprinkled, I just wish it was also mixed into the dough itself. The saving grace is the honey butter, I just wish there was more of it.     Mac N' Cheese came out almost perfect! The sauce was smooth and velvety. It had great ratio of sauce and pasta. Also, the pasta was cooked perfectly. The downfall to this dish is the lack of seasoning. If I have to add salt and pepper to any dish in any restaurant, that shows me there was no seasoning done by the staff during the prep and cooking phase.  The crushed saltines wasn't enough to help with the seasoning either. Also, more would have helped out with texture.  3. Dessert       The Hummingbird Cake Jar was surprisingly decent, for the most part. The banana pineapple cake was moist but the overly sweet cream cheese icing over powered the dessert. I love sweet, don't get me wrong, but by fixing the ratio of icing to cake and this dish would be  enjoyable.  4. Staff     I'm sorry. I work in the industry as well, but I don't need to hear the staff arguing loud enough for the dining room to hear to \"excuse me but I've been here since 6am\" from someone working the line. With an open concept kitchen, these are the things you should avoid.  5. Lay Out     It is not their fault but the design could be improved upon. The ordering counter is basically steps away from the door, so when the restuarant gets busy for dine in and take out orders, it comes to a head right there at the counter. If the ordering was at the far end close to the only booth in the restaurant, then maybe that would help out that high traffic area for an easy pick up and take away.       For the amount I paid and the service that I got, I am in no rush to come back until things settle down. For $33+ (not including tip), I could have gotten more food at Big B's Barbecue. Next time I'll make the trek there but don't get me wrong, I am still going to give Mama Bird another try for the rest of their menu items.",

The chicken is breaded in a thick, flavorful batter and cooked to perfection. It's served with a thick mac and cheese and even better, an everything biscuit, which was mashed up with Southern charm and NYC attitude and topped with honey butter.   Also worth an order are their deviled eggs, topped with a generous hunk of bacon and a few candied jalapenos for a bite that's simultaneously sweet, salty, smoky, unctuous, and spicy.",

    "text": "To me, Popeye's has always set the standard on fried chicken. Whenever I eat fried chicken at other restaurants, I'm always disappointed and think \"This is overpriced and not as good as Popeyes.\" But Mama Bird has definitely changed that for me.  The fried chicken itself deserves five stars. The breading was so good and flakey. It was perfectly seasoned and not too salty. I usually like eating my chicken with some type of sauce like ranch, but it was seasoned so well, I ate the whole thing by itself (and a little hot sauce for some kick, of course). The best part was that they had BONELESS thighs, which are unheard of(at least for me)! It was a lot less messy than eating regular thighs.  My friends and I also ordered the salt and pepper smoked brisket, which was great. The brisket itself was very tender and seasoned well. It had the right amount of fat and the bbq sauce was really good too.  We had the spicy fried green beans as an appetizer. The green beans had that nice crunch and the dill ranch was unique and complimented the dish really well. I just wish it had a little more kick to it. For sides, we had the sweet cream corn and the white cheddar grits. Both sides went well with our mains but I really enjoyed the grits a lot. Each dish also came with an everything biscuit, which was the only thing I didn't enjoy. The biscuit was too hard for me, but the honey butter that came with it, was really good.  The chef brought out their watermelon soft serve for us, which was funny cause that was what I came there for. And it did not disappoint! The soft serve had the right texture and wasn't too sweet. It was very refreshing.  Service was really good too. Even though Mama Bird isn't a full service restaurant, the workers and chef came by to check up on us frequently.  I definitely will be back again for the fried chicken and to try more stuff off their menu.",

We ordered the 8 piece meal with boneless thighs, collard greens, mac n' cheese, and everything biscuit with butter.  I have to say I was taken aback by the flavor of the chicken!  Fried and breaded to perfection!  The sides and biscuits were pretty good too!    They serve breakfast, lunch, and supper specializing in southern food.    Also, tried their watermelon lemonade and it was fresh and delicious, even came with a slice of watermelon.  Their sodas are craft and come in bottles, I found it to be classic.    Dining area and restroom is clean.  You'll constantly hear the sous chef and chef communicating which I find is a good thing.  Service was superb.",

My husband loves aaaalllllll the meats. Brisket, ribs, he loves it. I love all the appetizers and sides. Next I'm trying the salads and bologna sandwich.

The candied jalapeno puts the deviled eggs on another level. I just want to eat the jalapeno. It is definitely a must try- if you love it or not! Next we tried the shrimp and grits- it was good and tasty! It was something to eat the one time but would have ordered more deviled eggs instead  I enjoyed the pork belly, eggs and grits. It was good, for the price and portion, I think I would have ordered something else... maybe more deviled eggs . My husband had the brisket hash because the person behind the counter recommended it. It was okay!  He said he would have ordered more deviled eggs .  Overall we enjoyed our meal and enjoyed it with the watermelon lemonade. Sweet, but it went well with our dishes.   For the person complaining about straws! They have straws!!  The people who worked there were all nice! They greeted us and asked how everything was multiple times. We definitely will be back to try the barbecue plates and the watermelon sorbet.",

Ordered the Mac nCheese Waffle Chicken Sandwich and fries which was $13.95. When it came I was like omg how am I gonna eat all of it.  When I ordered I asked the cashier if their was any mayo or sauces and she said no, so when it came with sauce on it I wasn't too happy.   It tasted like Big Mac sauce.   Had I she told me correctly I woulda said hold sauce.    Food was amazingly really good,  chicken nice size and crispy and juicy.  Waffle was good too!

    "text": "I've been waiting to try this place for awhile. I finally went with a group of friends on a Saturday around 11 am for brunch. The place is pretty small inside, but they do have outside tables which were perfect in the great weather. You have to place your order inside and then wait for your food. The staff is super friendly and welcoming. My friends and I always like to order multiple different things and share everything.   -I loved their watermelon lemonade. I could've had 3 more glasses while I was there.  -Their deviled eggs were delicious. I especially loved the candied jalapeno on top.  -The mac and cheese was creamy and delicious. -The chicken tenders were large, juicy and flavorful on their own, but next time I'm going to ask for some ranch that I saw others write about. -The pitmasters scramble was unlike other scrambles. It was filled with different vegetables, the cheese sauce was the perfect touch, and the meat was crispy and flavorful. -We ended with the oreo red velvet cakes. Those were good, but a touch dry. I wish we could've tried the hummingbird cake, but some in the group are allergic to bananas and pineapple, so that was out of the picture.   I'll definitely be back to try some other items on their menu",

You seat yourself and order at the counter when you're ready. Unfortunately there was a mixup with our orders as the system for food delivery wasn't very efficient. I think they would benefit from having a table marker of some sort to ensure the correct order makes it to the guest.   We sampled the deviled eggs, ribs, chicken tenders, chicken wings, Mac & cheese, and fried chicken and waffle mac & cheese sandwich.  The star of the meal was hands down the Mac & cheese which  had crumbled saltines on top! So gooey, so creamy, and oh so sinfully delicious.  When I think comfort I think a big bowl of macaroni and cheese. All of the food was prepared fresh and tasted great.  If you are in the Southern Highlands area you have to give this little joint a try!",

My son ordered the chicken tenders.  He ate them all!  The only thing I did not enjoy was the sweet tea.  I lived in North Carolina for 19 years, I know my southern style sweet tea and how to make it.  The tea here did not taste right.  Had a funny aftertaste like it was instant and not home made.

    "text": "Dude the fried chicken here is freakin amazing! Just wanted to first get that out of the way.  So on a random Monday we decided that we need to go to Mama Bird's. It was actually on my bookmark list on my yelp, but I never found the time to go so my girl and I decided that we were going to go on a Monday afternoon.  Mama Bird is pretty easy to find since it's located in a grocery plaza with plenty of parking. When we went it wasn't crowded at all with only one more couple eating a late-ish lunch (3PM). We were looking to try the fried chicken and baby back ribs. Unfortunately they ran out of Baby Back Ribs since the day before was Father's day and apparently fathers love baby back ribs.  The interior was pretty nice and tables were clean. Staff was pretty friendly and service was quick. Keep in mind we were the only people they had to serve.  Here's what we ordered and what we thought: - Two Piece Boneless Thigh Fried Chicken with Mac and Cheese - WOW the fried chicken was amazing. It was crispy and not greasy. The breading on the chicken was done really well such that if you bite into the chicken ALL the crispy flavorful breading doesn't detach with your bite leaving the rest of your chicken naked and sad. You know what I mean? Like when you bite into a piece of chicken from KFC, Church's, or Popeyes, you could literally detach the entire skin from the meat on the first bite, enjoy that first bite with an incredible amount of the flavorful skin then the subsequent remaining chicken is all flavorless, depressed, unhappy, and probably a compulsive gambler. NOT SO with the chicken at Mama Birds. The skin and crispiness remains firmly attached to the meat like a toddler with separation anxiety to their mom on the first day of school. The seasoning of the chicken was so delicious. We also ordered a Boneless Breast Piece to try the white meat and it was just as delicious as the dark meat. I like me some good fried chicken and I often praise Popeyes and how they prepare their fried chicken, but I gotta say Mama Birds is a step above. - Mac and Cheese - This was alright. Tasted pretty standard like others I've had before. - Salt and Pepper Smoked Brisket with Collard Greens - Brisket  was delicious and tender. Seasoned just right. We took some home as leftovers and they tasted great the next day after being nuked in the microwave. - Collard Greens - I thought this was okay, but not worth getting. My girl really liked it and thought it was flavorful so I guess it's hit or miss depending on your preference. - Everything Biscuit with seasoned honey butter - The biscuits were very good. Well made and super flavorful. If you like the buttered biscuits from Popeyes these Mama Bird Biscuits are way WAY better. - Wicked Devil Eggs - These were great. The bacon and jalapeno blended well and nothing overpowered the other in the flavor department.  My Fried Chicken hierarchy from top to bottom is now: Mama Birds, Champagne Bistro & Deli (Newport Beach, Ca), Popeyes, KFC, Church's, All others (this includes the fancy smancy fried chicken I've had at other higher end restaurants, but they never seem to get it right and are not memorable in any way).  Mama Bird hands down has one of the best fried chickens I've ever had. We'll definitely be back to try their baby back ribs that we missed out on, but we'll definitely order the fried chicken again. If you haven't figured it out by now let me just clarify.......GET THE FRIED CHICKEN! GET IT NOW! DO IT! C'MON! DO IT NOW! IT'S RIGHT HERE!  GET TO THE CHOPPA!!!!  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FdV5wbfFD9go&s=8a69fa1ca576f69a020582a2dc6c5a65d4f02fd5fe3abc41b6bc3e060c463707\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtu.be/dV5wbfFD9go</a>",

    "text": "If you are seeking delicious southern comfort food, look no further! Mama Bird is a cozy, friendly  southern diner in Southern Highlands.  The food is absolute delicious. I usually can't finish most restaurant meals due to portion size. Because the food was so yummy I pretty much licked the plate clean. I ate the brisket and sweet potato hash, served up with two fried eggs and a slice of watermelon. I also had a watermelon lemonade. The watermelon was divinely sweet.   I asked them if my meal was gluten free and they said it was, but couldn't promise safety from cross-contamination. Make certain to ask them to omit the biscuit that comes with it if you are following a GF diet.   My boyfriend had the chicken fried steak. He said it was ok.   The only issue we had was the wait time between ordering and being served. If you don't mind a slower pace, and you can take your time leisurely, you will not be bothered. If you are in a hurry, this may not be a good experience for you.   The other problem that Mama Bird faces is space size. They can get busy, so finding a seat inside may be a struggle.   Regardless, I think this may be one of my new favorite places to eat in LV!",

    "text": "One look at the Mac N' Cheese Chicken Tender Waffle Sandwich and I knew I had to drive down to Southern Highlands as soon as I could.  Located in the Smith's plaza, Mama Bird has plenty of parking and outside seats. Upon entering, you order at the register then sit wherever you'd like.   Seriously, this waffle sandwich needs to be shared. The pictures don't do it enough justice! The thing is ginormous. My sister and I ordered our own and we barely made a dent. I couldn't get together one full bite so I dissected the top of the sandwich.  The Mac n' cheese on top was gooey while the chicken tenders were juicy and crispy. I didn't realize there were pickles until later on when I was snacking on it again. Nothing bad, the pickles just surprised me. You can also get fries or watermelon on the side. I chose the fries which was both sweet potato and crinkle cut potato.  Overall, we had a warm and pleasant experience here. I'm already anticipating my next visit!",

They put a mixture of veggies (a succotash) on the potatoes which has lima beans in it, now I've never liked lima beans, but I ate every one. It is a very good mix. Thank you Mama Bird for getting me to eat lima beans. The everything biscuit is moist, soft and delicious. Can't wait to try their wings. I'll be back for dinner for that. You should try this place.",

I ordered two salad one fried chicken, and waiting for 40 mins, they even did cook it, and they throw the receipt and forgot it. During the 40 mins, we asked two times about our food, they said they are cooking it. but finally, they did nothing. I will never come back. I am going to drive SF, we don't have this time wasting here.",

    "text": "So I've been to Mama Bird a few times and am so impressed every time I leave. The food is so good and the service is so personable and really keeps me coming back for more. I have been at different times of the day and am always welcomed in and greeted promptly.   The set up is an open kitchen and a cashier where you place your order and pay. Then you can grab a seat at any available table and they bring your food to you. Now even though it's a casual spot it's still very homey and themed with chicken decor and the workers will check on you to see if you need anything after they bring your food to you.   On my various visits I've had:  Deviled eggs with bacon and candied jalapeno: creamy deviled eggs with a nice spicy and sweet kick from the jalapeno. Perfect starter while you wait for your entree.   Boneless thigh fried chicken plate with macaroni and cheese and an everything biscuit: juicy and tender chicken thighs battered and fried to perfection topped with pickles and onion. The macaroni and cheese is creamy and topped with crushed saltines for a little crunch. The everything biscuit is so flavorful and fluffy and served hot with salted honey butter on the side.   Salt and pepper smoked brisket with creamed corn and an everything biscuit: the brisket was so tender and flavorful and was served with bbq sauce. The creamed corn was a perfect blend of sweet and salty.   Chicken tenders plate: huge and juicy chicken tenders that fill you up. Ask for Mama's comeback sauce and the dill ranch for dipping.   Pitmaster's scramble: breakfast potatoes topped with juicy brisket and pork belly, eggs, cheese sauce, and candied jalapenos and served with an everything biscuit. These layers of goodness went so good together. I'm not a huge breakfast person but I would recommend ordering this at least once.   Chicken and waffles: on Wednesday they run a Waffle Wednesday promotion when they have waffle specials from $5-$9. I had the chicken and waffles and it was so good. One big fluffy waffle topped with two big chicken tenders served with salted honey butter and syrup and dusted with powdered sugar. A perfect blend of sweet, salty, and savory.   Liam's strawberry ginger beer: we ordered a growler which served about 3 1/2 mule cups so it was a good deal. Sweet and spicy ginger beer that went well with our meal.   Watermelon lemonade: sweet and tart fresh ice cold lemonade garnished with a watermelon wedge. Refreshing and compliments breakfast, lunch, or dinner entrees.   I highly recommend trying Mama Bird if you haven't and I can't wait to come back for more. Mama Bird has made my list for top foodie places and whether you're a local or visiting Las Vegas be sure to stop in and support a good local business that will have you coming back for more.",

Well, y'all are legit, and I'm fresh from Florida, so my word in The South goes! Lightly fried chicken is yum. Dill ranch dipping sauce is perfect. Mac 'n Cheese is mind blowing. Now, the collard greens. Do you know how hard it is to make collard greens? I am the only person I know who makes them right, and now, here is Mama Bird, being added to my list of correct collard greens! I randomly found this place stopping in at Pineapple Park, and I am so happy I decided to come. My new favorite place. Come here to put the South in your Mouth! (Oh, and they got Cheerwine)",

    "text": "We just needed a quick lunch On Our way out of Vegas, and this was close to our hotel and promised to be at least different from the burger/taco/Denny's offerings.  Just didn't want corporate food. Mama Bird offers seating inside and outside. Food is ordered at the counter and then served to guests at the table, so not \"fine dining \".  However, the food is down home comfort food and our meals were above par for casual dining.  My wife and our friend (the FABULOUS singer, Shaunda Fry) ordered chicken and waffles and both of them were very happy with their meals. The waffles were \"perfect\" and the breading on the boneless chicken was dark brown and crunchy.  They shared an order of deviled eggs and gave two thumbs up, except for the pickled jalapenos on top.  I had biscuits and gravy and the biscuits were definitely southern style with cracked black pepper on top and if you've never had biscuits that way, get in your car and get this NOW.  I don't know any other place that does a good southern biscuit. The Gravy complimented the biscuits perfectly.  I appreciate The unsweetened fresh brewed tea and it sounds like a little thing, but you forget how satisfying just fresh brewed tea is when people put a little effort. It's nice to find a new place that does simple and delicious food. With a smile.",

The Mac and cheese is good, that one is a bit hard to judge because everyone likes a different time of Mac and cheese. Back to the shrimp and grits... it's real shrimp stock not that fake flavor most restaurants use, so delicious. The chicken is so tender and juicy!! The watermelon lemonade is a must to wash down all this delicious food and last but not least you Must finish this all off with the watermelon ice cream that comes inside a slice of watermelon... epic!

I had the 2 pc Chicken breasts which came with a biscuit. The roomie had the chicken and waffles. The chicken was crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. You can tell this was freshly cooked! For our sides, we shared the Mac n cheese, creamed corn, and collard greens. Mac n cheese was ON POINT!!! The corn was yummy, and the collard greens were ok to me. They had a little \"kick\" to it and I can't do spicy, so that's the reason why.   I highly recommend this place if you are craving good Southern cooking!! Next time, I'm ordering the deviled eggs! Hopefully I can get it without the Jalapeno though! Lol  The staff & owner deserve a HIGH FIVE!!   Thank you for the great food MAMA BIRD!!!!",

They had Togo boxes chocked full of perfectly smoked ribs, amazing Mac and Cheese and a biscuit made with some sort of magical sorcery. All Of the proceeds from the event went to a worthy veteran charity so I couldn't have been more in favor. They provided some menus and promoted the bro k and mortar location in the south end of town. The brisket hash is absolutely worth the trip by itself. 28 miles one way and can't wait to go back. They also have house made ginger beer. Not too sweet. Not to bitter. Perfectly mixed with whatever you want. And the final price of the puzzle, fresh hand made watermelon soft serve ice cream!  Don't pass this gem by!",

Mama Bird opens at 7am and serves a full menu all day, which was perfect for my post-work pimento cheese pick up. I ordered it without the bacon jam and it was a great snack and spread for the buttery homemade Everything biscuit. I only tried the cornbread waffle, watermelon, and eggs from the chicken and waffles, but it was an awesome looking dish.  One of the owners, Liam, makes his own ginger beer, which is a real treat for fans of this spicy beverage. I might need to stock up on some bottles of the version with real apricots.",

The same can be said for the macaroni and cheese; however the reason this is getting 4 stars instead of 3 is the biscuits and sausage gravy! I can't stand sausage. When asked if there are any foods I dislike, I always respond \"sausage and green peppers\"... So when I tell you that the smell of this sausage gravy was so enticing that I knew before trying it that I'd love it, it's special. I am definitely going back just for that dish alone.

    "text": "You know how sometimes you just walk into a hole in the wall restaurant, and you can just tell it's going to be a gem?  That's Mama Bird.    Now, my experience was far from stellar, however, this place has a ton of upside.  The environment is cozy but open, and the kitchen boarders the dining area.  There are no walls separating the two so you can hear the kitchen staff calling out orders, coaching, and generally enjoying themselves.  What can I say...I'm a food nerd so I love this kind of thing.  My meal was the tale of two restaurants.  I ordered the three piece thigh meal with a biscuit, and shrimp and grits.  The meal comes with a side, so I chose the white cheddar grits.  The cheddar grits were okay, they had nickel size chunks in them that needed to be mixed in, and lacked flavor.  I don't think they were intended to be like that because the shrimp and grits were smooth.  Shrimp and grits had big chunks of bacon and the shrimp were sliced in half down the back.  I'm no grit expert, but the shrimp and grits were also just okay in my eyes.  I won't order either of the two types of grits again.  Now, to the chicken.  I'm disappointed the pieces are boneless, but hey, if they taste good who cares?  The chicken pieces are huge, a two piece meal is plenty of food for one person.  The breading on the outside of the chicken is crisp and crunchy.  It's not oily, and the chicken is cooked well.  Maybe slightly overdone, but not dry.  The largest issue I had with Mama Bird was the breading on the chicken.  The first piece of chicken I had was perfect.  The next two, however, were inedible.  The breading at the surface of the last two pieces was crispy, however it wasn't cooked all the way down to the meat.  When I bit into the chicken, the batter squished into my mouth.  I threw two of the three pieces out because of this.  All in all, it's clear that the staff at Mama Bird know what they're doing in the kitchen.  There was some training going on while I was there, so I don't hold the chicken batter against them.  I'll be back to give them another try because if they can work out the kinks Mama Bird will be a diamond in the culinary rough that is Southern Highlands.  Tip:  The hot sauces on the table are delicious, I highly recommend them.",

Actually, we came in for brunch and got the watermelon wedge, with a watermelon lemonade, and had the watermelon soft serve for dessert. We also got the Everything Biscuit sandwich and the Mama's Fry Pan Breakfast. All were awesome!!!! The chicken was a total afterthought and worth it!!",

    "text": "FOOD BEST. CHICKEN. EVER! This place serves boneless thighs, boneless breasts, and tenders. They are so juicy and crispy that you don't need to use any sauces with it.   Their fries are amazing! When I got the three-piece boneless thigh meal, I asked if I could have fries as my side since it wasn't under the side menu. You get a mix of crinkle cut fries and sweet potato fries that are seasoned with a side of sauce that appears to be thousand island.   Everything biscuits here are EVERYTHING! It's honestly like an everything bagel but in a biscuit form with a side of honey butter.   TRY THEIR WATERMELON LEMONADE. JUST DO IT.  Also their watermelon with soft serve was so refreshing! It's a perfect way to end your meal here!  CUSTOMER SERIVICE Cathy and Serenity were so helpful and so kind when I came in. I love their hospitality!   RESTAURANT They make me feel like I'm at home. Also the decor is very lovely. I love the rustic vibes. It gets pretty busy on the weekends but not so much on the weekdays based on my experiences. Also it's not a huge place so plan accordingly!  I am so happy that Vegas has a place like this. This is my favorite go to places for fried chicken!",

Its also a restaurant where you order at the counter and then your food is brought out to you.  The food was good but the time it took for our food to come to the table was not up to par.  We ordered a mac and cheese, kids chicken strips, deviled eggs, shrimp and grits, watermelon lemonade and my husband got a brisket plate.  My lemonade was tangy and sweet with a nice chunk of watermelon displayed on the glass that my daughter took care of.  The shrimp and grits was probably the best I've had in a long time. It was a cajun style with a slight hint of spice. The only thing I would change is I'd like a bit more cheese on it.  They make the mac and cheese fresh on the skillet which is great but takes a while.    Why I can't give it a better score is because all of our food was brought out at different times. I finished my shrimp and grits before my kids and husband had their meals.  Our appetizer was brought out last instead of first. There was only one food runner on the floor and she was trying to do it all. There were several employees working in the kitchen so I'm surprised at the delay and differences in output.   I would dine here again but just order it for pickup.",

    "text": "I expected to find Mama Bird to be good southern food for Vegas, but it's definitely good southern food in general. Everything I ate here was delicious! I can't wait to return soon.   The restaurant is cute inside and has many details that give a southern feel. Food is ordered at the counter and then brought to the table.  The employees were friendly and on top of making sure everything was great from start to finish. When we arrived an employee greeted us and explained the ordering system. Our food didn't take too long to be prepared and employees continued to check on us until we were finished eating.  To start we enjoyed the Wicked Deviled Eggs. These were wicked delicious! The filling had a great flavor, some of the best I've ever had. The pickled jalapeno and crispy bacon were the icing on the cake.   With so many great drink options I broke from my usual beverage of choice, water. The sweet tea was perfect, sweet without being overly so. My husband's watermelon lemonade was refreshing.  The fried chicken was the best part! I had the 2 Piece Boneless Breast Fried Chicken Plate. I love that the meat is boneless to make it easier to eat. The chicken was juicy inside with breading that had a great tasting seasoning. The fried chicken wasn't greasy at all and had the best texture. I loved the flavor of the macaroni and cheese and collard greens. I'd order all of this again. My husband loved his Fried Chicken & Waffle.  A couple of small suggestions to make the experience a little smoother. The line to order forms from the back of the restaurant to the front. This isn't instinctive nor can the directions to do so be seen until you are past the register. It might make more sense for the line to form at the front. Second, food is handed to runners through or over customers paying at the register. This isn't just inefficient, but it didn't seem like a good idea to hand fresh food by other customers first.",

We both ordered the 3 piece tenders with Mac n cheese and a watermelon lemonade. We split an order of the deviled eggs and I got the creamed corn cuz I had to try that too. Everything was delicious, except the creamed corn, I wasn't a huge fan of that. But, the chicken was crispy and perfectly seasoned. The Mac n cheese was creamy and tasty. The deviled eggs, awesome. And the watermelon lemonade, I'd go just for that. If you're a fan of southern comfort food you definitely have got to try Mama Bird.",

We ordered the deviled eggs to start (perfect mix of savory and sweet with bacon and candied Jalapenos ), fresh sweet tea, watermelon lemonade  . Entrees we ordered were the fried chicken with cornmeal waffle and brisket hash with sweet potato. EVERYTHING was BOMB . All flavors are balanced, go extremely well together and SO flavorful !

Supposedly they are one of the top 5 places to eat watermelon at. I'll have to try that sometime. It looks like they also serve different flavors of ginger beer which looked interesting.   We went for breakfast so we didn't really try any of that. We ordered the mamas pan fry breakfast which was eggs, shoulder bacon, fried potatoes and a biscuit.  I think everything was really good. My favorite thing was the biscuit. It was a little bit of sweet but also savory. Nom.",

The portions were ample and well seasoned. The meal came with everything biscuits for each of us (plus one more) and two large sides. Collard greens and the Mac-n-cheese complimented the protein. And both of the proteins were fall off the bone, easy bite and coated with a great crispy dry rub.   We chose to have Liam's Ginger Beer with Apricot. Again top notch!  And since we got a bottle some LGB is going home with me. When I return with the bottle, I'll get LGB for a dollar off the price. YES!!!  Can't wait to return and try the hummingbird cake.",

Understanding that they're newly opened, I gave them a pass on how long it took to actually get my food.  Overall the portions were ok for the price, but I was disappointed in the quality of the food.  I tried a few different items so I could really get a feel for multiple things.  The brisket was absolutely amazing, but beyond that everything was mediocre.  The biscuit was dry, the potatoes were bland, and the \"southern style\" fried chicken tried way too hard.  It was vastly overbreaded, and when eating it all you could taste was flour and grease.  I'm hoping with some time they perfect their food quality a bit more, as I'd love to have somewhere better than KFC to get fried chicken.",

I had the deviled egg and bacon salad, my husband had the fried chicken and my daughter had the chicken and fries. My daughter is super picky and she even loved it (they even brought my daughter out a little side of watermelon, it was so sweet of them!) The food was just so good and you can tell it's made from scratch. Also, the staff there is so sweet and nice and make you feel so welcome. Thanks for the amazing dinner mama bird :)",

Their chicken was so moist and their biscuits are so good they're flakey and melt in your mouth.

Bread had great texture and a nice buttery finish.  Mac N Cheese - 4.5/5 Very thick and cheesy! Eat quickly while still warm.  Collard Greens - 4/5 Super flavorful, like a punch-to-the-mouth. A little sour, a little salty, a little spicy. It was great.  Everything Biscuit with Honey Butter - 4/5 Great texture, buttery and a little crumbly. Honey butter was a nice touch, but I think I would have preferred regular butter.  Overall I was quite pleased. Will definitely be back.",

They have excellent skills on the greens. Not soggy not too hard. Just right! I also had before the white cheddar Mac and cheese, . They crumble a saltine on top. Top 3 I've ever eaten. You have got to come, and early for the VIP booth!!",

I ordered 3 piece chicken tender plate with Mac n cheese and 8 oz salt and pepper brisket with collard greens. Once our food arrived, I loved the chicken tenders and the brisket. Both the meats were tender and full of flavor. I enjoyed the flavor of the everything biscuit. The way they did the honey butter was really unique they put honey in the bottom then a pad of butter in the middle of the container. It was awesome! I wish I could say more positives, but my experience was mixed. The greens were gritty and I could tell they had not be cleaned properly. There was no juice either they were very dry. The Mac n cheese was bland. The biscuits albeit they had good flavor were served cold. The food took a long time to arrive almost 40 minutes. It appeared as if they had only one person cooking and it was very overwhelming for her. Maybe I came on an off day.... however for this experience I had to rate it at 3 stars because the bad was more then the good.",

You order at the counter and seating arrangement is casual but the food is no joke. They serve hearty southern cuisine and I ordered a thick slab of brisket. It was very juicy, tender, and well smoked/seasoned. For my side I had the mac n' cheese, which was rich and satisfying. Their everything biscuit is light and has a really nice texture. I've been looking for a good brisket spot around my area and this is forsure it. Additionally, the restaurant's staff are very hospitable and Ryan, one of the head chefs, came out to talk to us for a bit. Give this man a raise, he's super chill. All in all, Mama Bird is a solid neighborhood spot and I will definitely be back for more.",

We were welcomed immediately and told we could sit where we liked and order at the counter when ready. Great selection but not an overwhelming menu which is a good sign. We got pimento cheese, which came with candied jalapenos and bacon on the side. It was our second choice because they were out of deviled eggs but we were pleased none the less. I liked that the jalapeno came on the side so my daughter could still eat the cheese. However I wish there was more because they were delish! We also got sweet tea, and watermelon lemonade. Both were very good. For mains we got 5 piece chicken tenders with Mac n cheese, an everything biscuit honey butter, and ranch on the side. Everything was great. I liked that the noodles had bite to them, it wasn't just all one mush texture. Chicken was very crunchy. I would've liked more spice, but my daughter loved it, and she's a super picky eater. My husband got the pitmaster scramble with everything biscuit and honey butter. He loved it. We had so much food leftover we were able to pack it up for road snacks. The staff was super nice and attentive, restrooms were clean, parking was easy. What more could you want? Will be stopping in again when we are in town.",

We are in Henderson, and is it really worth it to drive 15 minutes for southern food?..(first world issues)  Ummm yeah it is!!   Worth it! Place is nice and cute, modern mom and pop feel with a southern hipster vibe, if that even makes sense.  Reminds me of on of my favorite spots in So. Cal (Realto Cafe)  Food was bomb.  I had pork belly and grits, and it was cooked perfectly.  We also had the chicken Mac and cheese waffle sandwich, the watermelon soft serve, and the kid had chicken fingers (which he actually ate and finished)  I've included some pics.  Go ahead, drool. It was that good.  Service was wonderful.  Staff was cool, checked on us, and just real.    We met Liam, who was our cashier/server/runner. We came to find out that he is the mastermind behind Liam's ginger beer.  ((Not sure how we cracked that code)). Try the jalapeno!   Mind blown. Anyhow he was rad, the whole staff was, and one day that ginger beer will be famous.",

My faves were the Watermelon Sorbet, Mac n Cheese, and Pecan Smoked Baby Back Ribs. The Mac n Cheese was packed with flavor, I literally inhaled it. The rib meat just fell off the bone. I must admit I licked my fingers after eating all my ribs! To end the meal and cleanse the palette you must partake in the Watermelon Sorbet. My boyfriend liked it so much I only took 2 bites and let him enjoy the rest.  We also had the 2 piece Chicken Breast and Collard Greens. Both are on our \"order again\" list.   This amazingly delicious restaurant has a super friendly staff. Zach and Ryan were so kind. They answered all our menu questions and checked on us throughout the meal to make sure we were ok.   Portions are generous but it's too good to share an entree! Get your own plate and a takeout box.   Note to self: next time will have to try the Deviled Eggs and Fried Chicken Sandwich. Both look uh-mazing!",

This is my first time here at Mama Bird and I witnessed THE RUDEST customer ever. This lady ordered an iced tea. Staff called her to pick up. Lady asks,\"Do you have straws?\" Staff answered no. Rude lady slams the glass down and uttered, \"UGH! I'm not drinking this!\" And walks away...leaving the staff bewildered. I'm just thinking all in my head, \" WOW! Wowowowowow! Who gets all worked up over not having straws. I commend the guy who walks all the way to Starbucks to grab this lady a handful of straws because I would not have the patience for it. I guess you can say this was the last straw.   Anyways maybe the restaurant should put up a cute sign saying it's a straw free restaurant or a BYOS. Bring your own straw. But, I on the other hand, had a lovely time here at Mama Bird. I would say it started out a little rocky but the food was definitely something worth driving down here for. Everything was well seasoned and flavored beautifully. Loved the rustic theme and super friendly staff.   Even though, this was a new restaurant I think they still need to work out a few kinks. First was the whole straw fiasco. And second maybe put a sign up right when you walk in to seat yourself. When I walked in I wasn't sure if I should wait to be seated or seat myself. I didn't want to be rude but after a minute I asked the staff and they said it was open seating. Also maybe make a bigger sign or explain to customers about coming up to the ordering counter. I witnessed a father and son leave the restaurant frustrated because they thought a server was going to come up to them and take their order. And lastly, I was a bit turned off by the sticky table and floor and lack of bussing tables. My boyfriend and I came in pretty much when they opened their doors. Half hour later, people started swarming in but had nowhere to sit.   Overall, a few kinks to work out but it shouldn't be a big problem because their food is so yummy and their staff is super nice. We should all be able to look past it. Unlike somebody... ahem.",

To say the portions are huge is an understatement. Watermelon served after is a nice touch. Will be coming back. =)",

If you're in the mood for good ol southern comfort food, this is the place to go! They have a hefty selection of chicken and barbecue plates that everyone can enjoy.   I took off one star because the breading on the chicken was just a little salty for my liking. Other than that, we enjoyed our meal! Thank you Mama Bird for the southern hospitality! :-)",

    "text": "I had extremely high expectations about this restaurant. Anticipating for weeks for it to open. They have had so many open and close dates, this past Monday night was the first night open that allowed me to be able to try the food. We were so highly disappointed by Mama Bird.   Let's start with price. The price of the food at this restaurant, is a different sort of ridiculous. Even if the food was amazing (I'll get to that later), I wouldn't be able to afford to feed my entire family at this restaurant. $45 dollars for an eight piece chicken meal? No thanks. $13 for two piece meal with one small side? My God. We got two chicken meals that came with just one small side. Our total was almost $29 dollars. The price is just outrageous. What distinguishes this place to charge two to three times the amount of any other chicken place for a meal? Maybe they're charging for all the extra breading that comes on the chicken? Or the very strange 'everything' biscuit.  On to the chicken. The chicken is deep fried, in layers of breading. Layers upon layers of breading. It was about 60% breading, 40% chicken. The restaurant offers chicken tenders, boneless thighs and boneless breasts. The way they achieve thighs and breasts to be boneless, appears that it's mashed up chicken cutlets that have been combined together. It really was the strangest chicken ever.  It was very greasy and oily from the breading. By the time we got through about a half pound of breading, my appetite was completely turned off by the look and taste of the chicken underneath.  This chicken was offered to my two kids, my husband and my mom. Each said the same exact thing, this chicken is oily and overly breaded.  I really wanted to love this restaurant, we really do need more choices of places to eat at in Southern Highlands. But I'm not sure who can afford $50-$60 to feed their family on just an average week night. To spend that amount of money I would rather go to a nice sit down restaurant.  We were not fond of Hot Head Burrito that was in the place of this Mama Bird restaurant first, but this experience literally had my husband say, 'I wish Hot Head Burrito was still there'. I send my apologies to the owners of Mama Bird. We truly wanted to love your restaurant. But over charging for chicken that has been over breaded and full of oil, will not have us returning there again.",

Wholesome, clean, Excellent service, tasty, the Best chicken in Vegas Zack one of the owners came by spoke and introduced himself he was hospitable personable and genuine. I was surprised to find that this place has only been open for a few months and I hadn't heard of it. So let me tell you SnapBack sauce is a must with the chicken, soft serve is the most delicious dessert light weight and not to sweet, grit just amazing, chicken moist crispy and flavorful, and the watermelon lemonade i just need more of. I honestly cannot day enough about this place you have to try it yourself it's a must try.  Eat in or order to your door you will enjoy",

The place was decorated beautifully. Clean atmosphere. Gave the Watermelon Lemonade a try. Yummm! Food wise, we got an array of food to give a little bit of everything a try. Wicked Deviled Eggs, amazing! Those pickled jalapenos were life changing. Spicy Fried Green beans, Full Rack of Pecan Smoked Ribs with Collard Greens, side of Mac n Cheese. And those Everything Biscuits with honey butter. I need that recipe! Shout out to Ryan and the girls for taking great care of us! Next time we are in Vegas, we will definitely return.",

My husband also tried the chicken breast and the first thing that came out of his mouth was \"wow.\" Needless to say, I think we were both impressed.

We patiently waited to be greeted and for someone to clean a table for us but nobody ever said a word to us. They were all hanging out in the kitchen,  it wasnt busy so I have no idea why not a single person could bother to greet us. We would have been fine waiting for a table to be cleaned if they just said something to us. Maybe they thought we were getting take out but still they could have acknowledged our presence.

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place for awhile. I love barbecue. You can tell a lot about a place based on their local barbecue. When I heard they had brisket, I was definitely intrigued. I've been disappointed by dry brisket many times and I hope this place doesn't let me down. As we walked in we sat ourselves down and was greeted by NOBODY. Literally no one went to our table to greet us or hand us menus. So we grabbed our own menus and went to the counter to order. This definitely ain't the south when it comes to manners. I had their half rib half brisket special; my wife had the chicken and waffles with fried eggs; my oldest daughter had three chicken tenders with Mac n cheese, and my two youngings had the chicken tenders with fries. The food was good. The ribs were tender but the flavor was okay. Not mind bending or extraordinary. The brisket was moist and delicious. The Mac and cheese was really delicious. I gave some to my boy and he took the rest of the plate, LOL. My wife's plate was HUGE. The fried chicken was on point but the waffle was a little too crispy which my wife didn't care for. My kids all devoured their plates which were all good. Overall, good food but the service was almost nonexistent. Very not typical of most sit down BBQ restaurants. I don't mind serving my own water but for the price of the food, they could come around and get us water. The prices were high even by barbecue standards and I've been to outstanding four star bbq spots in North Carolina and Memphis that would murder this place. I'd recommend their chicken though for the taste and price.",

The coffee was horrible. The cook was loud and obnoxious the whole time. It took over 30 minutes to get our food. The food was good and southern. We will not go back again. Hopefully they will make some improvements with the service.",

No one knows what they are doing, and you may or may not get sick sick eating here. I ordered the chicken sandwich and I kid you not the meat was raw. So much pink and raw skin I knew if I took a bit I would get sick.  I didn't bother saying anything to the server. I paid and left. I didn't want it to be remade and I didn't care for the cash back. They will need it when they go out if businesses",

Almost 60 bucks with taxes, but was willing to support a local moms and pop place. With the price it set a very high expectation, I'm imagining these chickens  massaged and pampered just living that free cage life. Hoping they fried them up tender like some cajan pro pioneer lady was the chief. However these bock bocks ended up tasting like a slightly above average run of the mill caged up chicka dees. The sides we're pretty solid Mac cheese and sweet cream corn, with some below average biscuits. All in all a average spot but with the price tag throw in on it, there is no way I could run it back as a regular family spot.  This is a one and done , hit it and quit it spot, check it for your self I'm sure you'll agree.",

Simple menu which is great for the indecisive peeps, it gets pretty busy here and crowded where the counter and seats are for people waiting for their to go orders so even if you order to go expect to be waiting close to 20+ min I came in around 6pm. Food quality is good, homemade.I ordered the 3 tender combo fyi these chicken tenders are gigantic and ALL the chicken options on the menu are boneless thighs and breast I prefer bone in I feel like it holds more flavor and juiciness but their chicken still is good the batter on it is alright but kind of thick. For the price of their food this wouldn't be a regular joint I would come to nothing really stands out for me about this place.",

Food was tasty and decent size. I liked the fries coz it's mixed sweet potato and regular fries. The everthing bread was good too. We got the deviled eggs super late. We were already done with our food when we got it. Going to customer service, I would rate it a 1 star. The lady staff was yawning while I was giving my order and seems like she doesn't want to be there. Maybe she's tired? I don't know but you are in a customer service work my dear. I noticed she asked the table beside (on my right and the one one tsble hidden at the back) us how was their food but never asked us how was ours. If you are doing table touching, make sure you do it in every table. Maybe she knows I was upset already because we haven't received our deviled eggs at that time. When I asked her again about the eggs, she said they are still making it. I told her the other table got their eggs but I ordered before them. She apologized at least and offered soft served watermelon which I declined because we are not in the dessert mode yet. Finally got the eggs, nothing too special about it. When we were going out, passed by the same lady staff, she never thanked us or say at least have a great day. She pretended to not see us i guess which I doubt she didnt see us coz we passed right by her at the door. Now talking about prices,  it is expensive for self serve place. It is more expensive than babystack or eggs and I or rise and shine steak and eggs (which have servers that tend to your needs).",

I got the 1/2 rack of baby backs with mac n cheese and the husband got the Brisket plate with creamed corn. We shared the sides, and I have to say that there was not one thing on either plate that wasn't absolutely delicious.  Weirdly, my favorite thing of all was the everything bagel with the butter and honey on the side. The perfect blend of creamy real butter with deliciously sweet honey. Open up that biscuit and slather that stuff on and it's pure heaven. I might have to go back and get just the biscuit when I just want a quick snack.",

Which could be difficult for people that need to navigate there way out of the booth seats. I think it would be hard to accommodate anyone in wheelchairs, especially if it's busy. I wasn't too thrilled with the service it's not your typical check on your table and make sure you got everything you need. The waitress only came once to drop the food off, but luckily we didn't need anything badly. I ordered the grilled cheese brisket sandwich and the two piece chicken thigh, The portion is great, there is enough to go around and to get you stuffed. I was a lil worried about the pimento cheese but the brisket took over and it was a nice sweet tasting sandwich. The two piece combo portion was pretty good, enough to get you stuffed. We couldn't finish our sides. Overall I will be back for that Mac and cheese and ribs!",

I definitely enjoyed the sandwich, but as soon as I picked it up it dropped all over my shirt. So I recommend disassembling it before eating it. The waffle gets to soggy to hold it up as a sandwich. Sweet Creamed Corn was extremely basic but it was sooooo delicious. The only flaw keeping it from being a 5 star for me is the Collard Greens were just to salty for my liking, but it could've been an off day for the chef. I will be back! All my food was $26 that was including tip, and I left with a doggy bag. Next time I'll get a chicken dinner!",

Cathy and Scerenity were super friendly and made some great suggestions.  The deviled eggs were super good especially with the candies jalapenos.  The smoked brisket was super smoky and it really goes well in the grilled cheese sandwich and the scramble.  These are some of the best chicken strips we have encountered anywhere.  The cowboy candy BBQ sauce added a sweet and slightly spicy contrast to the fried chicken.  Mac N cheese was super good and creamy.  Even the sweet tea was top notch!  If you can drop by Mama Birds, add it to your Vegas trip.  It's well worth the drive and could tide you over for the drive all the way back to LA.",

    "text": "With a continuous influx of folks looking to escape winter up North or the high prices of California 2018 was a banner year for dining off-Strip, and although accolades came for spaces across town many seem to have overlooked Mama Bird Southern Kitchen which opened in Southern Highlands at the peak of Summer.  Located at 10550 Southern Highlands Parkway in the same plaza as Spaghetty Western, an area not far from owner Robert Chiti's own home, it is inside a long and narrow space that the UNLV Graduate and TAO Group Director of guest relations has built a tribute to the South, an Instagramable interior at the same time warm and inviting as guests are welcomed with \"Ya'lls\" and pleasant smiles.  Open at 7am daily and serious about both Food and Beverage, a native-Ohioan named Zachary performing double-duty as General Manager and Pit Master, it is from laminated menus and overhead boards that guests are invited to make selections, the counter-style ordering a bit cumbersome given the breadth of choices and in particular during peak hours when indecision can create a logjam in the waiting area.  Playing music at appropriate volumes, appropriately southern but mercifully not all country, guests are encouraged to begin with nonalcoholic Ginger Beer from Liam's, a variety of flavors including Lime and Jalapeno each intense from Mule mugs and a nice compliment to Appetizers such as housemade Pimento Cheese or fried Green Beans with Cayenne in the Batter.   Featuring signage that reads \"Wicked Chickens lay Deviled Eggs,\" and rightfully turning the phrase into creamy Yolks with subtle heat beneath Candied Jalapenos and Bacon, Entrees include both lunch/dinner and all-day Breakfast from which Pork Belly that is smoked four hours is a highlight, the Fat rendered and everything else almost as supple while Grits with White Cheddar, Sunnyside Eggs and Watermelon marinated with Citrus round out the plate.  Obviously gunning for \"the Gram\" with a fork and knife Sandwich overflowing in Macaroni and Cheese plus Chicken, Lettuce and Tomatoes - both the fried Strips and Cheesy Noodles better on their own while a crispy Cornmeal Waffle proved difficult to assess as a result of its toppings - Sides including two styles of Fries plus Cream Corn and an \"Everything\" Biscuit all performed well with the latter in particular quite enjoyable as Cheddar Cheese is folded in and plays well off house-blended Herbs and Spices.   Originally not having planned to order any Barbeque, but convinced by Zach that the 12+ hour Brisket cooked over three woods and Pecan smoked Pork Ribs were worth it, it is for $25.95 that diners receive a half-rack that easily slips off the Bone plus a mix of lean and fatty Beef, the smoke not as deeply penetrating as Big B's though nonetheless very good while Desserts such as the Hummingbird Cake and Oreo Red Velvet are delicious bargains for just $4, as too is Watermelon Soft Serve though if Mama Bird was being honest they'd list it with an asterisks giving Dominique Ansel credit.    FOUR STARS:  With no website or marketing budget outside of Social Media Mama Bird is looking to make a go of it on quality Cuisine and word of mouth, the former largely accounted for at fair prices while the other seems to be spreading, though the counter-style ordering should be gotten rid of to create better flow and items built for Instagram should be skipped in favor of the good ol' fashioned stuff.",

You can get food togo so I offer that as an option as well. There was a large group of people that came in after me that did that. They too were in awe of the food.  I got the everything biscuit and gravy. Came with scrambled eggs. I also got a side of pork belly and brisket.  The lemonade that they make is flavored with watermelon. I had that mixed with sweet tea. Everything is house made. The tea mixed with the watermelon was great!   The group of people that came after me got two refills.  The eggs were very fresh and seasoned well. The sausage and biscuits were not overly salty, which can happen. Even in the gravy they retained their shape and density.  The brisket was delicious.  Not too fatty and had a great texture.  The bbq sauce was good but really not needed. Also the big wedge of watermelon should have been sliced on the plate so it could be enjoyed as a refreshing after meal treat.  The pork belly was not fatty.  If anything one might think it was over done, but it was really delicious and a bit different than most pork belly I have had in the past. I recommend it.  The only negatives I can report is the manner in which they take the orders and deliver the food. They need a more organized method. When you walk in there are some bar seats but there were so many people waiting that you really couldn't sit there. When I ordered they said they will bring it to you or you can come grab it. They have only been open 6 months so I am sure they will get it under control. Zach the owner is incredibly motivated and eager to please and serve everyone. Watching him honestly and earnestly work the room was a treat. He just needs a bit I'd help in the floor.  I'm looking forward to a return trip. The fried chicken was flying out of their kitchen. The ribs looked pretty amazing too.",

Plus some really great sun tea (unsweetened, I just can't do it lol) to polish everything off. We almost came here for brunch, and now we definitely will! Best Southern food in Vegas next to Lola's!

We had the chicken breast and the tenders with a side of corn and Mac n cheese and for starters the deviled eggs.  Ask for some of their dipping sauces to go along with your food.  If I were to pick a favorite it would have to be the cheese biscuits with honey butter my mouth is still watering. We loved the biscuits so much we bought an extra 2 for the road home.   Best part of our visit was Kathi's hospitality!  Kathi was very friendly and knowledgeable and took the time to share details about every dish and some of her personal favorites.",

Serenity, who put us on this mix of drinks - I don't know it's a mess but it's a beautiful mess and it tastes delicious. It's caked \"muddy water\", and they mix sweet tea, watermelon, and lemonade altogether. That was the best thing on the menu. It was a non-alcoholic beverage laced with crack. On God, that shit was amazing. If my hype disappoints you, I'm sorry. Serenity won't disappoint though, she's amazing.",

For $22 got three pieces of cold very salty raw chicken, a small lemonade and two half full mac and cheese cups one with soggy crackers and one without no cheese sauce just noodles.  The chicken is all pre-cooked and not made to order.  Nothing Southern about the taste at all maybe Southern Nevada.  We are from the South and this is not even close. The biscuit was even stale.  Maybe a bad day or just always like this.  Fell short for sure today.",

We ordered the pecan braised ribs & brisket with the sweet creamed corn. I also ordered the deviled eggs because who doesn't want to try them?!   MUST TRY their ginger beer! I loved the strawberry one! But if you're looking for a kick, try the jalapenos one! The staff was nice and helpful, they greeted us right away and broke down how the restaurant works. You order at the counter and pick a seat, easy peasy!   The only downside and upside to eating here is everything is seemingly prepared to order. We waited about 25 mins to get our deviled eggs and another 10-15 mins for our main meal. But I did realize they had multiple large pick up orders so that may have been the main reason for a longer waited time.   The serving portion for the ribs and brisket was large, enough to feed 2-3 people. If you really want to try the biscuits I would order another one since it only comes with one.",

Not a fan of the order and get your food and going back to cashier for coffee refills.  So probably better suited  (for me) as an order and pick up vs sitting down and eating.  Dad had the brisket hash, which was good.  He didn't like it, thought it was salty and it had sweet potatoes.  The staff was nice and friendly.",

Grits were easily the best I've ever had but I'm from NJ so it's not my specialty but these were fantastic. Pork belly was on point. Almost crispy outside and beautiful inside. I stared at the menu on the wall the entire time I ate, mapping out my next attack plan. Can't wait to try the ribs, wings, and the ridiculous chicken waffle and macaroni & cheese creation the guy next to me ordered!",

Brisket had great flavor and was served in nice thick slices. Decent bark and smoke ring but it prob could have smoked a a little longer for give it a deeper ring. Ribs were great and pulled right off the bone. Lots of meat on them too. Decent sized half rack compared to other places in town. As for sides we had the greens and Mac n cheese and both were tasty. Mac could have been a little bit more creamy but still tasted good and the greens had a nice kick to them.   First time here and won't be our last. Will def have to come back and try the chicken or some breakfast.",

(The honey butter was the best part) The mac n cheese tasted bland and like there was more milk and other herbs than cheese itself. Coming from the south, I was really hoping for something close that would be up to standards to the many other southern food places that I'm used too. Besides the food not being good. The prices are a little ridiculous. There is a place called Joella's chicken in Kentucky that does the something similiar(if not the same) dinner style that this place did, and it was better priced AND tasted better. I'm not sure if they are taking advantage of being in\"Southern Highlands\" to charge that much for subpar southern food, but I would go somewhere else or look up a recipe for what they serve because it would probably be cheaper and taste better.",

I love friend chicken but was surprised to see the breading was more of a dark brown than a golden crisp. Almost as if it stayed in the oil too long or it was in old oil. Thought I had a bad batch then saw pics, nope it's the norm. The biscuit was pretty good and buttery down side is I ordered two but got one instead. I am glad to see folks like it but it is not my kind of friend chicken. I'll stick to homemade, blue ribbon or churchs when I'm in a time crunch",

    "text": "I recently visited this restaurant and loved everything about it. The food was great. I ordered half slab of ribs, the BBQ sauce was awesome, a little spicy just the way it should be! My fiance ordered the fried chicken sandwich, which is pretty much his go-to whenever we eat anywhere. The staff was friendly and helpful and there to answer any questions. The BOH staff came out to touch tables which I think is great coming from the hospitality industry. My only concern is that, I believe it was the head chef, maybe the chef/owner, talked to other staff members like they we're children. Explaining to them how to clean out the fresh juice machine made my skin crawl. I get that he probably has been working with these guys for awhile and he knows the way they learn the best or they understand how he teaches... It was just a little off-putting that guests could hear him belittle the staff. Just a observation. Everything was great otherwise.",

    "text": "So I really really wanted to like this place!  I haven't thrown in the towel but we're not off to the start I hoped for.  We live across the street and my husband and I like to sneak away for breakfast when the kids are in school. Today was the day.  Here's the break down:  1.  No vegetarian options and a very small choice for breakfast.  Husband had to order ala carte.  2 waffles and 2 fried eggs was $16!!!!!  Really??? No meat, no cheese, nothing fancy.  Eggs and waffles should have been offered for $9.95 at the most.  And before we all come with our pitchforks and say \"it's a southern chicken restaurant\" they have to understand that not all families are vegetarian and we want options so we can dine out as a family.    2.  I really wanted the chicken and waffles or chicken fried steak but I can't bring myself to spend $15+ on breakfast....that's dinner pricing!  So I ordered the biscuits and gravy for $11.50.  Now I love all things biscuits and gravy so I was happy to choose that.  But I'm still kinda hungry.  The biscuit came in a small dish with gravy on top.  Um, I'm still hungry.  Ok, not starving but it was like a half serving of what I'd get elsewhere.  And I think the gravy was flavored with sausage because I all I got were tiny crumbles. Flavor was good.  My over hard eggs were runny.  They did offer to fix it though.    3.  Date breakfast was dampened by the price.  Now we're off to work and I'm wishing I would've packed a  lunch.  4.  I will say the waffles and honey butter were good.  My husband did devour it.  Just not $16  dollar good.  5.  I do want to try the chicken and I will be back to give it a try.  And if I love it it will be my guilty pleasure.  Because we're a family of 6.  My kids think dinosaur chicken nuggets are the bomb so their is no way we will come here as a family because my husband can't eat here for a reasonable price and I can't bring myself to spend a $10 on two chicken tenders for each kid.  My kids would want ribs too and $15+ for small kids is nuts!  Suggestions: 1.  Offer some vegetarian options (you have everything there to make some killer menu items!!!) for a reasonable price.  His meal should not have cost more than mine.  2.  Offer a kids meal.    3.  Broaden your breakfast offerings.  Again, you have everything there already!  Hash browns, bacon, and sausage would be a great addition!",

Now the bad...Overpriced fried chicken limited to breast & thigh meat, which was disappointing. Chicken was bland (unseasoned) and over cooked...that becomes a problem when cooking white meat vs dark. Drastically over floured.  The sides were mediocre at best. I can throw down in the kitchen, and have Southern lineage but this place was a complete miss for me. The biscuits were just plain awful. Not light & fluffy...heavy, tasteless and dry.  I opted out when offered to-go containers.",

The portion offered for $14.95 was very good, It was a lot of food. However the mac and cheese was relatively flavorless, and the breading on the chicken tenders did not stick well. The waffle could have spent a little more time on the iron...it was soft and soggy and the bottom fell out pretty quickly.   It came with a mixture of crinkle cut fries and sweet potato fries that looked very good and seasoned well. unfortunately, they were greasy.  I also had the everything biscuit with honey butter. The biscuit was soft and tasted good, but was heavy on poppy seeds up top. The honey butter was not mixed well-or at all. It was butter next to honey.  I did enjoy the watermelon lemonade. It was pretty refreshing.",

The 1/2 slab rib meal also comes with the same and the flavor of those ribs is on point! The LGB ginger beer is perfect not overly sweet at all and comes in a cute jar served with a Moscow mule mug very refreshing and delicious! The Chefs greet you upon arrival and even check on you to see if the food is ok loved that! We ended our meal with that super delicious watermelon  soft serve  this place is a must try!

    "text": "Mama Bird is such a cute, refreshing addition to the Southern Highlands community. When you first enter the restaurant, it's like you're walking into a southern style home. The theme was kept all throughout from the tables and chairs to their glassware and of course, their hand crafted ginger beer (non-alcoholic)! It is open seating so space is limited especially during busier hours. We came in during their lunch rush but was able to grab a seat that we split with another couple. It wasn't a big deal, we still had plenty of room to get in and out of the booth seat. You order at the cash register and subsequently grab your food from there when done. It was a little crowded at the register, again it was a lunch rush, so it probably would have been easier if they had a number system where they could bring out your food to the table instead of everyone hovering around the register. It took about 15-20 minutes for our food to be ready but it was well worth it! I ordered the spare ribs and my boyfriend the smoked brisket. It came with their everything biscuit and a side of your choice. It was a decent amount of food so we had to take our Mac and cheese to go lol. We also decided to try their original lime ginger beer and watermelon lemonade which went perfectly with all of our food. All in all, we had a great experience and plan to come again to try our their sandwiches! I would recommend coming if you're around the area!",

    "text": "I thought church was only on Sundays? My trip to Mama Bird was on a Monday and it was a small religious experience to say the least! Walking into this small spot I had some good intel on what to expect...good food and homemade. The building itself is small and it fits the vibe of the place. Blake Shelton was playing and friendly faces working made me want to throw back a shot of whiskey as I waited to order. The menu is tight but has a nice variety of things to try. It's almost like the team here got a big bag and dragged it across the south picking up some of southern cuisines greatest hits...then adding their own twists.  My gf joined me for this meal and being a southern girl her opinion reigns supreme when it comes to southern style food. We opted for the spicy fried green beans to start. They were light and crunchy paired with a dill ranch like dip. The snack section here is a lineup the Golden State Warriors would shiver at. For mains we had chicken tenders and the boneless thighs. Perfectly seasoned and juicy like a peach inside. The comeback sauce has a flavor similar to another beloved chicken establishment. That might \"Raise\" some eyebrows comparing it but it's that good. Being the glutton I am I saw the meals came with one side but ohhhh boy were they big! I had the cheese grits which were just the right amount of slutty cheezy goodness you would crave. My gf opted for her regular side of Mac and Cheese. The saltines on top of the Mac n Cheez seemed like gilding the lily but the Mac is amazing!   Do not pass on the drinks here! Hey liquor board give them a license already! We had the watermelon lemonade and the LGB ginger beer both were unique and great!   You can feel and taste the soul in this place. As cliche as it sounds typing that ...it's True. I live close by but this would be a place I would make a food pilgrimage to on occasion. Hey postmates F**k you for delivering this places food...but hey I can eat this at home yet it probably tastes better in the warmth of the place itself.  Check this place out!",

    "text": "We started with the fried green beans and loved the dill dip. Then got the pimento cheese with candied jalapenos and bacon jam, well put together twist on a southern classic. Then we sampled the brisket slider on the everything cheesy biscuit, simply put... phenominal! Then we moved to the entrees. I had the brisket and ribs combo with mac n chee, the brisket was so tender and intensely smoky as were the ribs. I rarely use any bbq sauce and while it was very tasty i didnt feel either meat needed it. My wife got the fried chicken and collard greens.  Chicken was expertly cooked and very crispy and served with a sauce that was incredible! My son opted for the chicken tenders and dries. These were some of the biggest tenders i have seen, same as the fried chicken very crispy and delicious! The fries were a blend of crinkles and sweets, very nice touch. Well worth the drive and we will be back again soon! My new favorite BBQ joint!",

The brisket is DANK, tender and fatty served with a nice smoky bbq sauce.  Fried green beans were simple and delicious, served with a nice thick dill ranch.  I don't eat a lot of bread these days, but the everything biscuit was too tempting and I took half of it down.  Yum, I'll be back.  Oh yeah..  TOPO-CHICO!",
