Tonight's visit was a major cluster- the employees are scrambling and Taylor, I think she must be a manager, was real bossy and unpleasant to the employees in front of customers which I don't think is good. Ordered a chicken chopped salad- and my salad came without chicken and with a dressing that doesn't belong with my salad. If you're in the mood for BS, I guess this would be the place for you.",

I like the roll given each for soup & salad they also add a touch of love with chocolate covered strawberry. I would recommend for a nice meal",

On another note, the service here is the absolute worst! If you are planning to order for more than one person the employees automatically panic. You go through a whole order and then when you get to the end of the line they ask you to repeat your order once again. Half the time I repeat it, no one even writes it down or does anything with it.. it's like they ask for fun. Also, my order is always somehow wrong. The wrong sandwhich.. missing a meal...   From now on I will avoid this location & drive to another, just to avoid this service.",

    "text": "Train wreck. For a place giving the illusion of being \"homemade\" and \"healthy\", they have an extremely shitty selection for vegetarians. Only one vegetarian sandwich and NO vegetarian salads?! Maybe 3 vegetarian soups, but we're in the desert.. I'm not going to want soup when it's 110 outside. Strike one.   Came here around noon with the fiance after a gym workout. This is a new location, and was packed. Similar to places like Q'doba and Chipotle, you start at one end and work your way down the assembly line. The first lady (with a glazed over look) \"greeted\" us with \"for here or to-go\".  Us: for here.  Her: would you like to try any salad or sandwiches today?  Fiance: a soup and sandwich combo, please. Her: would you like to try a salad or sandwich today? Fiance: (extremely confused) a soup and sandwich please? He proceeds to order a Cuban sandwich and clam chowder, to which she rudely says to order the soup at the end of the line. She looks at me and repeats her slogan, \"would u like to try a salad or sandwich today\", to which i also say \"a combo\". She, again, repeats her question if i want to try a salad or sandwich. I repeat my order that i want a combo with a veggie sandwich, add sprouts and onion. Another gentleman behind the assembly line snaps his head around and says they can't add anything to sandwiches, only salads.. You're freaking kidding me, right? Strike 2. Also ordered vegetable and quinoa soup.  They were extremely unorganized behind the line, waaay too many employees that don't know what they're doing behind the line for the space they have.   Ordered soup at the end of the line and the soup dude asks what sandwiches we had (they weren't finished being made yet) and looks around, lost. Dude next to him talks the fiance into a cheesecake. 2 lunch combos, 2 drinks, and a slice of cheesecake-$28. Strike 3.  Food- my vegetable quinoa soup was really good. Also, the cucumber basil green tea was great. That's where it ends. \"Vegetable\" sandwich was absolutely pathetic. ALL bread. (although fresh) One piece of Muenster cheese, 1 tomato, tiny specks of mixed greens, a few sweet peppers and a cilantro sauce that was decent. Fiance's chowder was straight up runny and he said it was very salty. He said his Cuban was decent. He said cheesecake was just ok. We both got a \"complimentary\" piece of bread, and a small, chocolate covered strawberry that was very mushy.   No thanks. If I'm in the mood for that type of food, I'll stick to Panera. 2 stars only for the tea and the soup, and that's being generous.",

My BF and I went there for lunch on March 30th after deciding to meet up there on our lunch break. We both hadn't eaten anything all day as we both had a hectic morning. We were excited and hungry! I ordered a pesto chicken panini and a cucumber green tea from their fountain tea drink selection. My bf got an Italian sandwich and a clam chowder and a soda from the fountain drink. After eating my sandwich which I thought tasted good and drinking my drink which was disgusting, my BF ate his sandwich which he said was OK and soup which was disgusting and watery! We left full and a little disappointed. It was definitely not something we were planning on going back to...  After about 30 minutes my BF and I both began feeling sick!!! My BF is a physician and he knew we both got food poisoned! I did call the manager (she said her name was \"sharika\") the next day and she said she'd look into it...but this was enough to forever turn me off from any zupas for the rest of my life! I also warned all of my friends and family to never take their chances here... My BF and I both had to return to work feeling like dying and I was soooo sick and nauseous the whole day and felt like death!!  My BF didn't vomit like I did but he was feeling the pain!   BE AWARE OF POTENTIAL FOOD POISONING!!! PROBABLY DUE TO THE LACK OF QUALITY CONTROL BECAUSE THIS PLACE WAS CROWDED!!!",

Today I had a turkey artichoke panini with red pepper and lobster bisque.   The soup was fantastic I expected it to just be lobster flavored, but there's a noticeable amount of lobster in there. It came with a chunk of baguette (which I wish was a little crustier).   The sandwich was good, but it was made for gringos- thankfully they have a selection of hot sauces (I settled on chipotle Tabasco). It was also a little too mayonnaisey for my taste (I don't like hot mayonnaise), but somebody else might like it. It was still good mind you, just not great.   I didn't have an issue with the portion size (perhaps it has been corrected). I'm kinda muscley, so I'm typically a big eater, and I was satisfied (as my second lunch)  The staff is super nice, if they're still this happy in a few months, they're service and culture manager will be pilfered by Disney. Seriously, the service standard is fantastic.   In the end, we'll be back, however; the food at Panera is a little better.",

It seems to be very consistent across the board at all the locations I have tried, the food is the same and service is the same, which is a good thing, you know what your getting! Decent food, decent price, good service.  I'm a big fan of the Honey Bacon Club. I don't care for the salads. The soups are pretty good too but I wish they were hotter when you get them to eat in, they are just warm and if you don't eat it fast enough, it can almost get cold. I rather take it home if I can and heat it up a bit. Love the Garden Chowder (its not thick and heavy like a chowder usually is). Not a fan of the Wisconsin Cheddar, it's not smooth enough. The Enchilada and Tortilla soup are pretty good. Red Pepper Lobster could use more lobster. I think the soup toppings are a rip off for the price  (.69) but sometimes I can't resist adding some cheese to my soup. You get a free side of bread with your order and a chocolate covered strawberry, yum! Cakes and dessert bars are good, the creme brulee isn't \"real\" so I will never get it again. I will return to Cafe Zupas, where ever it may be!",

When I lived on the other side of town, just off of Eastern, I would end up going to either Pin Kaow, BJ's Brewhouse, Beach Hut Subs, Griddlecakes, Smashburger, or Taco Y Taco. It just had the bad luck of being in the same area as ALL of these other dining establishments.  So when I saw that they opened one just up the street from the new house, I knew I was definitely going to check it out! Sure enough, just the other day I experienced Cafe Zupas for the first time and here is what I took away from it...  Pros- -Fair prices for what you get. For $8.79, you get a choice of 2 out of these 3:Sandwhich, Soup, or Salad. -Employees were very nice and friendly. They explained the whole process and answered the questions we had. -Sandwiches are not huge, but combined with the soup, was quite filling. My Italian Club was very tasty, but that Chili Enchilada soup was incredible! I want a large serving of that next time! -The restaurant is new so it was, of course, very shiny and clean. -Chocolate covered strawberry with each meal is a nice little touch....and yummy...I loooove strawberries!  Cons- -It was 45 degrees out and raining when we dined here and they were blasting the A/C. Ummmm, I am freaking shivering, can you please kill the A/C while I eat?? I am sure that will be awesome in July, but in the first week of January? I think not. -As others have stated, when you first walk through the door, you walk through a bunch of crammed little 2 and 4 seaters to get to the line. Must be awkward as hell on busy days. They definitely need to fix that.  Other tidbits- -Fountain machine serves Coke products, including Coke Zero!(Yay!) -Nice little outdoor seating area out front, with a few table settings under umbrellas facing Rainbow Blvd.  I was very happy with my first visit to Cafe Zupas and definitely see many return visits in the future!  4 stars.",

    "text": "This was my first visit to a Cafe Zupas and I have to say it is decent for what it is.  I wasn't in love with my panini and neither was my mom so I will probably steer clear of those in the future and just stick to regular sandwiches, soups and salads.  My mushroom bisque was delightful. Creamy and rich with the right amount of mushrooms. I would come back just for soup when I'm in the mood again.  The only thing I didn't care for was the restaurant layout. All the chairs ere huddled so closely together it made it pretty difficult for people to navigate around the restaurant since there was no clear path to the ordering line, trash or drink station. Everyone kept bumping into one another and it became quite irksome. Since they just recently opened I'm sure these are small tweaks that can be made to improve as they learn.   The staff is all very new as well and it was slightly more difficult to order than it should've been given the fact that I had to repeat my order three separate times as I moved down the line. Might be a little easier if I could just say it once and someone could write it down. Not too hard for ordering one item but when I was trying to remember what everyone in my party wanted every time I had to repeat the entire order it became harder to recall with each subsequent interaction.   Otherwise a decent quick eat spot for bites on the go.",

I like that you can pick 2 of either a sandwich, soup or salad and its $8.99- if you get a soup, you'll get a hearty slice of soft crusty bread too!  I got the spinach artichoke sandwich and a chicken tortilla soup and my husband got the grilled cheese and tomato basil soup with orzo. They are perfectly sized and you actually get a full sandwich with your meal.   If you want something light, this is a good alternative to other soup and sandwich places. They have drinks infused with different teas, berries and raw honey too. I tried the pomegranate infused tea and the cucumber basil infused tea and it was refreshing and light. before I forget, they gave you a piece of chocolate covered strawberry as well for an after meal treat!  All in all, I'm coming back for a light dinner or lunch!",

She asked the lady in the front multiple times and then asked if the wheat bread had any and they adamantly said NO. As soon as she took a bite she could feel her face getting itchy and swelling. We asked the employee and he said no it has no quinoa in it. Then he comes back 5 min later and says actually it does. By this time she was swelling and she had to run out to get Benadryl. The GM there was rude and asked \"what do you expect me to do? Next time ask a manager\". This was insane. So not only did they give us the wrong information and cause an allergic reaction, but then they blamed it on her!!! You should be ashamed. You don't care about customers at all.

House-made healthy soup/salad/sandwiches served at an affordable price.  Though I did like the food, I thought the service here was just odd. They have an assembly line where each staff seems to have a set station but it's extremely unorganized and inefficient. I also think the ordering system here is plain confusing. I don't know if it's just me but I had a hard time figuring out how to order or what to get. Also didn't help because I'm at one station ordering a sandwich and a staff at a soup station is already asking me what soup I'm ordering. \"Would you like some soup today?\"...\"Sorry I'm still deciding.\"   Then 20 seconds later, \"Would you like some soup today?\" \"WOULD YOU LIKE SOME SOUP TODAY?\" ....Holy moly, how many times are you going to ask me? Calm down soup server. I'm not ready yet.  I guess it is my fault for not knowing what I want on my first visit? Then come to the register and we are met with a rude cashier. Ugh.  On the bright side, our food was fantastic. We got kale and quinoa salad, cuban grilled pork panini sandwich, wild mushroom bisque and asian citrus chicken salad. Salads were drenched in dressing so I did not like it too much. However, I did enjoy the sandwich and mushroom soup.   Cuban grilled pork had a smoky taste to it. Panini was thin and sandwich was a small portion but I loved the flavor. Small bite and I was instantly in love. One bite kept me wanting another. Mushroom soup was rich and creamy, wish it had more mushroom in it instead of few small pieces. I got to try a sample of tomato basil soup and that was one of the best soup I had. Wish they sell it by gallon.   Unpleasant service but enjoyed the food. I would come back in a heartbeat especially now that I know what I like from here.",

The grilled cheese sandwich has nothing special and the cheese they use hardly taste like cheese, American cheddar I presume (looks like it). Chocolate strawberry to end on a sweet taste.

This has to be addressed with corporate and taken off the menu. They need to go back to the drawing board and fire the chef or VP that allowed this recipe to be used. I guarantee Zupas takes this Thai chicken off the menu. The manager for this S. Rainbow cafe in Las Vegas should speak up to corporate before more bad reviews are written. Friend says Zupas is only known for their salads and soups.",

Salad was not too heavily dressed and veggies were super fresh and tasty. I also like the strawberry for a tiny sweet after the meal. Definitely try the house blended drinks made with raw honey, just enough sweetness and very refreshing.",

They have also messed up my salads multiple times by not checking what is written on the top of the box (usually saying no onions and they put onion on).

My hubby had the vegetarian sandwich and the lobster soup. I tried some of his and his was also amazing. Everything is fresh, they're fast and it was very tasty. I love that this place is right near my house and its good. There are no lunch places around that I like except for sushi which I love but its nice to have a soup,salad, sandwich place nearby. They have an entire system going on in their kitchen. One group making the salads, another making the sandwiches and another making the soup. I was very happy with my meal and the atmosphere. I will definitely be recommending this place and going back again for lunch. Yum! Thanks Zupas for coming to my neighborhood.",

    "text": "I was really happy with this newly opened cafe, and can easily get over the few flaws that I found. I had the combo which includes sandwich, soup, and salad for $8.79 I added the pomegranate coconut water green tea . There are 13 sandwiches to choose from , 12 salads and 10 soups . You can also add deserts if you choose and they also look delish.  Expect a large lunch time crowd here . Here are the few drawbacks I encountered during my visit . At the time of this writing (April 2016) the cafe is newly opened. There seemed to be some minor confusion between the employees trying to match sandwiches to salads and soups for different orders. With time , this problem will fix itself . The other drawback was a poor design of the cafe. Aparantly they don't have a back service entry door for deliveries. That means that the daily (because they use fresh ingredients) come through the same small door which customers are using . Awkward to hold up foot traffic for a pallet jack full of deliveries. Even more akward is they use this same customer entry door to wheel out the trash bins (yuck). Aside from those two drawbacks ... I really enjoyed the food and will DEFINATELY come here again and again .",

The sandwiches, the cuban and turkey club, were just okay. Not a whole lot of flavor and I expect flavor from a cuban. The drink station was nice, plenty of different options but super crowded. It was busy and I felt rushed to make a selection. I didn't try the salads but they did look super appetizing and healthy. The price is right for what you get, definitely a good value. Personally I prefer Jason's Deli, they definitely have Zupas beat in the sandwich department.",

Their turkey and pork sandwiches are all right, but their crab sandwich is gross with imitation crab. The lobster bisque is the best soup ever, but the clam chowder didnt taste like your normal clam chowder. Would be 5 stars, but most of their sandwiches just arent that great, a lot taste like something you could make on your own with ingredients you can buy at Coscto. Their salads and soups however are amazing. Salads have great dressings and fresh fruits. The best is the nuts about berry with the poppy seed dressing and candied nuts! The salad portions are really small though. I recommend getting soup in the to-go cups, but salad in the for here bowls. I can tell a big difference in the portions. The desserts are amazing too, but way overpriced. $5 for a thin slice of cake?? Also I always do big orders and they make me repeat what Ive ordered 3 times...But they do give one free chocolate covered strawberry and piece of bread with every meal. Friendly staff, always fast even when its busy. I feel like they could make a profit if they offered pastas and sold their dressings and soups by the bottle. Try their try 2 combo!",

Since it took a while longer to transact than we originally figured, we found ourselves hungry after \"mission accomplished.\"  Having not been in that neighborhood before, and having seen the sign, we thought, \"why not?\"  We entered the building and \"saw the sights,\" as it were.  (DISCLAIMER: AS HAS BEEN NOTED IN THE PAST, ORCHID HAS SEVERAL FOOD ALLERGIES, WHICH DOES OCCASIONALLY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO CHECK OUT A NEW PLACE.)  We were concerned about several issues relating to ingredients, expressed or implied, in certain of the offerings, and so, as we have so many times before, we asked about ingredients used.  Imagine our surprise, shock and dismay when we were told that they would not divulge the ingredients - even a specific request such as \"is there any soy in this?\" or \"do you use any hot peppers in this?\"  When we asked why such a medically-reasonable request was being refused, we were told that they did not comply with such requests to keep their recipes from being stolen.  HUH?  After about ten minutes of discussion on whether or not an allergy qualifies as a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act, as well as a few more simple requests for specific allergens in their preparations, we finally decided that their \"policy\" meant more to them than new clients.  We left, with no intention of ever returning.  -- -- -- -- --  On the Nighthawk 100-point scale: 5.  (No, that's not a typo; that's a single digit.  Five.)",

Yes, the entrance is tricky but as adults, it's not that difficult to find the entrance to a line; so I'm not going to complain about that.  2. My biggest complaint - every time I've been in, it's extremely overstaffed which would automatically make you think quick, friendly service.. Completely wrong. This is the slowest assembly line of over 8 workers at a time that I have ever experienced, it's actually pathetic how slow they are when the lines aren't outrageous (chipotles lines are longer with less workers). I'm not an impatient person and don't mind waiting for my food but why have so many people getting paid to stand around? On top of that, while you're in line, prepared to be asked what you ordered over 5 times from different workers. I haven't experienced any rude staff. In fact, most are very friendly; so maybe that's what has made me return. I just find their assembly line to be extremely disorganized.  3. The salads here are delicious (especially the mango berry) and is another reason I have returned..but don't be prepared for anything fantastic when you're ordering the soups. I tried the tomato bisque to accompany the grilled cheese. The sandwich was really good, the tomato bisque was disgusting..it was so sweet (yes, sweet..so gross) none of the other soups look that appetizing either.  4. I'm hoping that this is just a trial and error because this was the perfect location for them to open one up and I don't want disorganization to keep me from giving this place business.",

The Zupas on Sunsets food is always amazing. I typically get the Italian sandwich and the cauliflower soup. The sandwich is always packed full of ingredients, bread is soft and delicious and the soup is a little thicker and creamy, and tasty at the one on Sunset. Now let's talk about the new one on South Rainbow. For some reason the food is always less than Grand. My sandwich is puny with very little ingredients. Today I ordered my normal Italian sandwich and the cauliflower soup. Literally I think my sandwich had one piece of meat two tiny peices of sprouts and nothing else. The cauliflower soup literally was the consistency of water, hardly any flavor, just not good. How can items differ between the stores, if they serve the exact same items? The store on South Rainbow needs to get some tips from the store on Sunset!",

When I got to the register I had my creme brulee and the girl at the register charged me for a cake instead. After she rang me up she looked at my order and said \"oh\" in a hesitant voice and asked if I got the cake instead. I told her that I got the creme brulee and asked her if the pricing was different and she hesitated again before saying no. After leaving Zupas I decided to check the prices online to assure myself that I wasn't charged more, but instead I found out the cake was more and she ended up charging me the more expensive price. I thought it was strange when she kept staring at me as I was leaving but now I know she was making sure I didn't complain. Honestly being charged more wasn't a big deal, being lied to was the reason I was upset and will probably not be returning to this location.",

There's not a tone of lunch spots in the area (getting better now) so anything in the area from noon-1:00 will be packed. Plan accordingly.  Not sure what everyone's negative comments are for, it's a quick spot for a delicious bite to eat.  Lots of seats, yes, but we've never had trouble maneuvering, and my husband is in a wheelchair. My favorite soups are the chicken enchilada chili (despite what someone else has said, doesn't seem cheesy at all; it's thickened with masa) and the cauliflower soup (super rich).  I typically get the BBQ chicken salad, and my hubby gets sandwiches. Everything has been great. We eat here at least once a week and the only bad experience was they took longer than normal to make our salad and sandwich and by the time we paid for our food and sat down, our soup was barely lukewarm.  Far better food, quality, and choices than Panera, the blandest lunch spot in earth",

Maui Tropical Chicken is also really good. The BBQ chicken is okay. Their soups are amazing. I love the Lobster Bisque and the Wild Mushroom. The soups are not too thick or heavy which is why I like them. The price isn't bad. You choose two between a salad, soup, and sandwich. There are usually a lot of people working so the service isn't too bad but there was once instance where a couple of the employees started getting into it. One of the employees even told me that she was going to kill the other employee. Lol you can add extra ingredients in your soups for extra charge. They did forget some ingredients this one time and I got charged for it. I really enjoy this place and I have been here over 10 times. The drinks bar offer refreshing drinks; especially during the hot summer months. Check this place out.",

The girl taking my order didn't help me at all, I was trying to get a simple sandwich with a fruit cup and was practically ridiculed by her and the girls making my food. They said I couldn't customize my sandwich and then when I ordered their custom one with none of the fancy stuff on there, then they all just started laughing and looking at me like I was dumb. Then I tried to get a fruit cup instead of a salad or soup and she told me that was pretty much for kids. Wtf! Who cares I'm trying to give them money for a little thing of fruit and she's worried about me not being a 10 year old. So I tell her fine just give me the sandwich, so she's like OK and literally throws the box, that has my order written on it, to the counter where they were making it. I was polite and smiling the whole time but these girls were not helpful at all and very rude. I would not recommend.",

I'm always down for anything so I figured why not try it out.  When you walk in you order at the counter and they prepare everything right in front of you. You're also able to sample the soups before you decide on a flavor which is nice. I chose to go with the Turkey Spinach Avocado (TSA) sandwich and the red pepper lobster bisque. The meal also came with a complementary roll and chocolate covered strawberry. Um yes please!   Overall the food was great! I loved the soup and the sandwich was mad decent too. I also love all their unique drink choices. I had the pomegranate coconut green tea which was very refreshing and delicious. They also had a few other flavored iced teas and lemonades.  I can't wait to try literally every soup here as well as the whole rest of the menu. Goodbye Panera, hello Zupas!",

I'd come back here when I'm in a mood for a quick salad-to-go.   I'm not a huge fan of either of the breads they used for the panini or the pulled pork. Nonetheless, is is worth a try.",

Same greeting repeated over and over to every single customer does not make it authentic in any way, I come here often and I actually very much enjoy the employees that don't follow these nonsense rules. Don't ask me how many orders, let me just order!!! Stop measuring toppings, it makes you look cheap and greedy, no one wants to see their salad measured and their tomatoes counted, c'mon?! FILL YOUR SOUPS!! Either that or get appropriate cups that your portion size fits in.

Once we got to the front of the line we were greeted by an energetic, friendly man who explained how things worked and took our salad and sandwich order.  If you haven't been here before its very similar to paradise bakery. You order your salad and/or sandwhich first then move down the line to the soups. The service itself was fast and friendly. At the end all your food is on the tray and you are met with these delicous looking home made brulees. OMG! Its hard to resist.  We tried the California chicken sandwich, lobster bisque , turkey avocado sandwhich and Maui tropical salad.   Loved the salad...so refreshing and delicious. 5   The lobster bisque was a little of a disappointment. I was expecting a creamy, lobster pieced filled soup like I have had at other restaurants. This one was more like mass produced, a bit watery based, no lobster soup. I get it that they probably go through gallons of this soup and they can't have people chopping up fresh lobster in the back so maybe u expectations were a little too high.   I'll go back to try the rest of the food..there are tons of choices.",

    "text": "I must say I use to love this place when they first opened. But now they raised the price a little I feel like the portion size has dwindled down to the extreme. More so on their to-go portions. I got the Kale-quinoa salad, and wow how little it is. I paid $12.10 for a soup and salad.   As you will see in the picture I added chicken to my Kale-Quinoa salad. I paid $1.79 for extra chicken. To pay that I got a sad amount of chicken in my salad. Not even full size strips of chicken, bits and pieces for almost $2? I usually don't complain about the price. But my goodness, a little stingy on the portion for almost $2 extra for chicken. I know that restaurants try to portion out the food for food cost. I would know I use to be a Sous Chef. But for the price of the food I really think the portion sizes should be looked at a little more carefully. I personally do not think I got what I paid for. Like I stated earlier I use to love this place, it's sad to say that I have to give 2 stars. I sure hope they take these criticisms into consideration.",

    "text": "Cafe Zupas finally opened up on the southwest side of Vegas! What a time to be alive. Both the exterior and interior are very modern and industrial, with high ceilings and a mix of wood and metal accents. The organization is a bit strange, seeing as you enter through a single (instead of double) door and have to awkwardly snake your way through dining tables in order to get to the line. They should have followed in Chipotle's footsteps and had a separated section against the wall for a line.   There is plenty of seating and even though the line was long, it moved very quickly. Employees were not the MOST efficient but there were so many of them, their inefficiency was negligible. There is so much signage and menu options it seems a little confusing and daunting at first. Basically you order your salad and sandwich first and order soup and dessert later if you want some.   My parents and I opted to share two preset combos, although you can order everything separately and salads can be custom made.   Conclusion? Price is stellar for what you get and the food is much healthier than most fast casual restaurants out there. There's a great variety of choices but I find all the flavors to be to strong (too salty, too sweet, too much sauce). I could barely finish the kale and quinoa salad because it was so drenched in sweet dressing it made me sick. I'll just ask for dressing on the side next time. The sandwiches are kind of small and dinky looking though. The little chocolate strawberry is a nice touch.  Great place to stop by for a quick lunch.  Yelp 100 Challenge - 2016 [3/100]",

With the soup you will get a nice piece of bread and every meal you get a chocolate covered strawberry. The cauliflower soup and BBQ chicken salad are my go-to lunch items here. Really good.   If you walk in and there is a line, don't fret cause it goes by really fast. They have a great selection of teas and lemonade as well. The desserts are all really good too when I feel like pigging out.   I wish they had more coupons or a punch card or something. It would give me more incentive to go more.",

The sandwiches are not meant to be reheated because they were pressed in the panini already. The soups are an entirely different story.  The ingredients and taste of all the soup are extremely superior to any of the soups in our area.  I have enjoyed the lobster bisque, roasted red pepper and lobster, chicken enchilada chili and wild mushroom bisque.  Anything they suggest to go on the soups is .69 per add on just so you know.  All of the soups were phenomenal but the red pepper lobster is my fave so far.   My suggestion is go for any of the soups in a large to go container as you will get more than if you order out of the bowl for dining in.  I basically go there simply for the soups.  They also have several desserts which were all decadent and very tasty",

    "text": "Triple S!!! Sandwiches, Soups & Salads galore!! I'm absolutely 100% totally a fan of this place!!! Every time I've come, the food and service has been spot on, accommodating to the occasional specific request (I ask for my strawberry not dipped in chocolate), consistency in taste and freshness of the food served is a huge reason I'm a fan and speak so highly of this place, as well the reason I give it 5/5 stars   Location is easily visible from the main road Rainbow Blvd in a brand new plaza. It has lots of seating as well as outdoor seating available. Very well lit as the entrance and one side wall is floor to ceiling windows.   Lunch time gets rather busy especially at the peak of the lunch rush between 11:45am-1pm. The ordering system is very much like an assembly line system so at each part of the line a different person is assisting you. I will admit during their busiest times this may (or may not) get confusing but just keep moving forward and the rest will follow in place (puns totally intended lol)   I always get the try 2 combo which give you the option of salad, soup, sandwich obviously pick any of the two. I do the soup and salad. What I like is that unlike other establishments that do a salad sandwich or soup combo option, you get a full panini sandwich verses the half of one. I normally get the mango berry salad that is completely vegetarian (no meat) and it comes with an amazingly sweet but not too sweet or thick mango yogurt dressing that I always get on the side (calories control). I've also tried their Asian citrus salad that perfectly pairs with a citrus peanut type ginger vinaigrette dressing. Although I've sampled all the soups, I always still end up ordering the roasted pepper lobster bisque. They do have original lobster bisque but I like that added kick in flavor. Another soup I recommend is the wild mushroom. Seriously, their options on the menu are pretty endless so I'll definitely be in to start trying other things on the menu. Sandwiches that I've tasted from family while dining has all been really good as well! Maybe one day I'll check a bit and order myself one of the sandwiches.   Drinks are separate at $1.99 but at the drink station they have in house brews that are all naturally sweetened with raw honey only so I love the pomegranate lemon coconut water. I always grab an extra lemon slice to squeeze into my drink as well. They also provide flavored syrup sweeteners as well. The in house drinks are definitely worth trying and I highly recommend it. They have 4 different flavors.   Every order comes with a roll of bread (wish it was warm bread) & a strawberry dipped in chocolate but I get mine without chocolate. This place also offers desserts which I've had the cheesecake before, but I come for the healthy eats do I tend to stray away from desserts,   The combo is $8.99 & I walk away full every time. My salad is always tasting fresh. I do wish the soup was a little of the thicker side and less thin like it's been watered down but that's not enough for me to knock this place off a star.   The area is great, place stays clean, service is great as they have people that come around and ask to take your plates when done, & it's been a consistently pleasant experience for me every time I've come. I really do love coming and eating here and I most definitely will keep coming back for more!",

I have had several things on the menu but I like the Cuban pork sandwich the most ( no mustard for me) and all the soups are good it is always too hard to pick one!  I occasionally get dessert which has always been the mouse cake... it is sooo good!  The staff is always very friendly and speedy. Also very helpful with the menu items.

I think this a great place overall & workers are really friendly.",

I asked if I could have a few more pieces of lettuce (because 8 leave does not cut it when it comes to salad) not only was I told no but there wasn't even an option to buy more??? I don't know, I love the food but it just seems everything thing else seems to be going downhill fast. Sad to say this is our last visit, but if you want an amazing side salad for $6 have at it! On a good note the mushroom bisque is out of this world, and the protein cobb salad can't be beat!",

The only thing I don't like (this is for the parents) is that the high chairs do not lock and they are on wheels. I always have the clean the high chair we choose. The restaurant is always clean but they should spend a little more time cleaning the high chairs. Kids spill things in odd places. Other then that. Pretty great place .",

They call out some of it and then make your salads.  Then you come to a soup line and someone asks if you have any soup as part of your order.  You then proceed to a dessert case where someone new asks you to repeat your entire order and then to a cashier who, surprise, asks for your entire order and if you want any drinks.  As a family of four, this is the most annoying process.  Can'y you write it down, or have an electronic order system so you don't need to ask me four times?  Also, prepare to have at least on of your items be wrong and you need to ask to have it remade.    The food is ok and I like their housemade drinks.  Oh, you walk in the door and you almost hit a table.  I want to love this place, but after a few visits in the last few months, I am over it.  And good luck finding parkin during peak hours.",

No one seems to know what they're doing, and they all seem very uncertain about everything happening.  The food itself seems...off. The portions of fruit in the salad I got (nuts about berries) seems much lower than normal. The lobster bisque was insanely watery and contained absolutely no meat (not the case at other locations).   Personally, I'd drive the extra 5-10 minutes to a different location if I was really jonesin for some Zupas.",

Upon ordering, the gentlemen who assisted me and my friend was very welcoming and well mannered. It was my first time so he allowed me to sample the soup. I chose the crab bisque but the tomato basil soup was super good as well. Also I chose the crab avocado sandwich. I had a seafood craving that day, haha. I love how the portions are double of what bread gives for about the same price! I couldn't even finish all my food but can't forget about dessert so I also purchased the cheesecake and got a free strawberry dipped chocolate. Also, the place is very clean and the kind worker took away our dirty plates away from us :) I will return to try out other items!",

    "text": "So my friend had told me about Cafe Zupas because of the Lobster Bisque soup. I checked it out at the Lake Mead location and the food options and pricing immediately made me think of Panera Bread. The soup was good but not better than my beloved Broccoli Cheddar soup in a Sourdough bread bowl at Panera. For that reason alone I was likely to choose Panera Bread if given the choice in the future.  However upon visiting this new location I think Zupas now has the edge. The food options are great. Just ordered a Try 2 combo and was able to get a whole Turkey Spinach Artichoke sandwich and a half salad of Glazed Chicken Chipotle. It came with a side of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry. The strawberry is a wonderful little addon that Panera does not do. Also this Rainbow location has House Made Drink Infusions that are lightly sweetened with Raw Honey and a much healthier alternative to soda or sweet tea. I'm inspired to recreate these at home and drop soda out of my diet.   This place gets bonus points for all the fresh produce, local dairy, and overall healthy ingredients. Menu is way easier to navigate than Panera as well. New favorite cafe and I will be spreading the word.",

What I love about this place is that it's not greasy fast food. It's fast, sure, but the quality of the food is so much better to me than anywhere else. Actually, that's not even the only thing I love about this place, I just love this place.  Every time I come in I order what is to me one fantastic lunch: the Italian club sandwich and a half size of the mangoberry salad. The sandwich is great, don't get me wrong, the lettuce is nice and crunchy and the bread is just soft enough and the meat is good, but what REALLY draws me to this place, what really keeps me coming back for more, is that heavenly mangoberry salad (with extra cinnamon almonds). I'm a fruit salad type of girl so this just hits the spot for me. They use a spring mix in the salad so the sweetness of the fruit and dressing is balanced by the occasional spiciness of the radicchio. I would recommend this salad to everyone I know, I just love it!  As for the place itself, it's roomy, it's clean, and I've yet to have a bad experience here. The service is so friendly, which is great, but honestly I'm just there for the food. I don't think anyone could go wrong here, because they have a variety of sandwiches on ciabatta bread or paninis, salads (or feel free to make your own), and soups that I've yet to try. Long story short: good stuff, two thumbs up.",

If that strawberry isn't enough to satisfy your sweet tooth, I recommend trying one of their many delectable desserts including their cheesecake. You'll be in sweet heaven! Also, they have seasonal menus as well so they're always switching up their soup and salad selection to include even more variety for their customers.

Normally I eat something before I eat at Zupas because the salads are a bit on the small side and I don't like to leave hungry.  I didn't have time so I just went and ordered the normal salad that I get.    I asked the \"shift leader\" if I could have a little extra lettuce with my salad.  Not any of the items that they put on it, just lettuce so that it would be a little more filling. The shift leader said to me, \"No we can't do that because we have no way to charge you for it.\"  WHAT? I even said back to her that I wasn't asking for extra Protien or fruit or anything that actually would increase the cost of it, simply a little more lettuce.   To which she replied, \"sorry, there's just no way to do it.\"  I've NEVER been to any other restaurant that would not give you a little more lettuce!  OR, at a minimum, figure out how to charge more for each and every item on your menu.  Is is very clear that this establishment is NOT interested in customer service or retention.",

You can also switch one of those choices for half a salad, but there's no better hangover food like some carbs and soup in your stomach.

This is more than enough food and such a great value. They also let you taste all the soups, which makes it quite difficult because all of the soups are delicious.

I was in-line next to a girl ordering a soup and they were out of bowls. The girl next to me got a huge Togo cup and a discount too. I simply said does that apply for me as well as in a joking way. The girl looked at me and just gave me a smile. Then she gives me a small Togo cup. I ask can I get the free pasta that comes on top. She takes a deep breath and just puts a little in my cup. I tell myself what just happened. Unbelievable the service of this girl. Sadly I won't be going there anymore.",

Since my salad fell through the rip, the ranch inside exploded all over it.... didn't even eat the $9 salad. -the cherry on top: when my sick sister was in the midst of eating her soup, we found a long piece of hair inside.   Definitely did not eat the two things I ordered that costed me $18.   I used to only come here to support the schools fundraising, but there's a reason why I never return. I only came since my younger sister is very sick and wanted their soup. I'm so incredibly disappointed.",

Pricey + Small Portions = Leave Hungry.   I've visited Cafe Zupas a number of times. I think the service is always on point and the food I have tried is very tasty. The location is always clean no matter how busy they are.   For me, the downside is definitely the small portions. I have observed the careful attention to detail that goes into making a meal. You will notice that the small portions are consistent. Each item that is added to the salad is carefully measured and portioned.   While I really enjoy the service and food, I simply can't square it with the price and portions.",

It was absolutely delightful and the chocolate covered strawberry was a nice treat as well. I would order this again.   My boyfriend had a 2 combo with Lobster Avocado Sandwich and Mushroom Bisque Soup. He says he enjoyed it but expected the broth from the soup to be a little creamier but the taste was still good.

I always pay attention how they prepare your food. Every time I go at cafe zip as on rainbow I noticed portion served is less and less but price hasn't changed beside zupas charging you for drinks or extra \"salad topping\" I did not even order.  Last experience was Friday 08/04/17 Ordered a \"make your own salad\", it took the guy who picked my green about 2 minutes before he was able to figure out the amount of green he will give me. Then he removes 4 leaves out of my plate when the portion was already small. Then on my 5 toppings, the woman did the same thing. Shake out as much as possible the mini spoon so nothing was left RIDICULOUSLY GREEDY  I do not mind paying extra, I never complain about it But las Friday was like \"really?  I like Zupas but I won't go there again. TOO greedy, staff is unprofessional  Place could be fancy but ZUPAS on rainbow make sure quality and what clients are paying for is given",

Once the order is in, it takes no time at all to prepare. Their SPECIAL isn't bad either, order a sandwich and a half soup or half salad for $8 and change. To be honest, the sandwiches are kind of on the small side but what they lack in size they make up for it in FLAVOR. I usually order the ultimate grilled cheese so I can dunk in my tomato soup, which is freaking AWESOME. Also, the cherry balsamic chicken salad is BOMB DOT COM! Both are a must try. They also have a nice assortment of fruit infused waters, which are delish, if your tired of the regular old fountain soda drinks. The orange infused berry one is my favorite. They also have yummy looking desserts(which I haven't tried yet, because I'm usually full) which consist of cheesecakes and brownies. But all orders come with a chocolate covered strawberry which is a nice touch.",

The soup was heavy with lobster in my opinion it was a little too much it took away from the red pepper taste, but still DELICIOUS! The sandwhich was to die for i loved everything about it, the second combine 2 dish i tried was the New England Clam Chowder with the Honey Bacon Club sandwhich, the clam chowder was eh, nothing to special but very good.. The sandwhich was amazing as well but after awhile the taste of honey mustard became a little too much, to me it tasted like a corn dog. The place was clean and the atmosphere was very nice, not to mention the infused drinks they had were amazing! My favorite had to be the Raw Honey Lemonade.. super good everything seemed healthy definitely worth the 4 stars. Oh and the chocolate strawberries are what made this place worth coming for! Even tho sometimes you get a smaller strawberry than someone else.",

Every time I come in they are extremely busy but also very quick and make sure to double-check orders, meet every guests need, and they keep the place clean and welcoming! They cross their t's and dot their i's! Every employee seems to be pretty happy and genuinely pleased to help you AND to see returning faces! I'll be coming back for sure! #ultiforlife",

It was definitely busy as it was lunchtime for the area. I work from home so I don't usually get to lunch out much. Anywho, there are lots of salads and soups and desserts on the menu. They have a combo where you can try half of one selection and combine it with another half of something so I chose to have half the garden chicken chop salad and a cup of the lobster bisque. I did not end up eating the bisque so I don't know how that tasted. The homemade blue cheese dressing was excellent though. And every meal comes with a chocolate covered strawberry made in the back of the restaurant (which you can see them doing as you are cruising through the line getting your fixins). Also, as an added bonus, these folks are skilled at handling the rush of lunch and get you in and out super fast.  So if you like salads and soups and the combination of those as well..... definitely stop in and give them a try.",

Ordering is easy, everything is on a line and made as you walk down it. My favorite sandwiches are the pesto chicken, the cuban grilled pork, and the honey bacon club. All three are absolutely fantastic, but the other sandwiches I have tried there are all wonderful. I love the chipotle chicken salad and the chicken enchilada chili as well. The place can get really packed very quickly, but it normally moves pretty quickly. For having food healthier than that of other fast foods restaurants, I'm happy to go here when I need a lunch. I've recommended this spot to many of my coworkers, and everyone has loved it!",

The reason I give it three stars it's the service. They are extremely disorganized when it comes to checking out at the register and figuring out your order. I come here on a weekly basis since it opened an it has not changed. I'm finally writing this because its happened too many times. You hear other customers complain, I've complained and employees agree but still they don't make changes to their order check out. It's not rocket science other restaurants have figured it out. I'm giving it one more try and jf nothing changes I won't be returning permanently. Hoping management reads this and gets a clue. By the way the employees are extremely nice and polite so nothing to do with their willingness to help and be friendly.",

Everything sounds tasty like a gourmet item, so making a selection was difficult. Luckily, they allow you to sample the soups. Since it was late on a weekday, there werent many people in line. The staff was extremely patient as I sampled 6 different soups. When dining out I try to order things that aren't routine, leaning towards meals that are new for my pallet or things that I would not ordinarily cook. I was torn between a brothy soup or a chowder. The gal behind the counter recommended the cauliflower soup and once the cheesiness hit my taste buds I was sold! I paired that with the kale and quinoa salad. For $8.99, I was pleasantly surprised that it also came with bread and one large chocolate covered strawberry. The salad was hearty, with a good mix of fixins with just enough kale to goodies ratio. My sister ordered the crab avocado sandwich, which I had to sample. It was a delicious, on a warm panini bread and I'd order that next time. I am a Zupas head!",

The sandwiches are light and honestly if you get a half salad (as I did) you'll be full after eating, maybe even with left over. The salads aren't too saucy and the greens are crisp. I also tried the strawberry lemonade, yum! Please try this place :)",

I have a SEVERE ALLERGY to quinoa and before placing my order I let the employees know and asked for items with NO quinoa OR cross contamination. They said they would make sure that my food didn't touch any quinoa. I ordered a sandwich on whole wheat bread. After two bites I started to feel my face itch and swell, so I asked 2 employees at the register if the bread had quinoa it it, they both confidently stated no so I sat back down thinking the itching was just in my head. A few minutes later one of the employees came back saying there IS quinoa in the bread! The GM expressed ZERO concern, then proceeded to argue that she didn't know what we expected her to do about it and that next time I should make sure I tell a manager about my allergy before ordering food. Next time a customer tells any of your employees that they have an allergy, I hope you take it much more seriously. You are lucky my allergy is not fatal or even more severe than it is. They should be knowledgeable about what they are making. If they don't know, THEY should ask the manager rather than reassuring the customer that they will be taken care of WITHOUT knowing. The GM kept arguing with us, so my friend took care of the rest as I ran out to get Benadryl. The manager refunded my food, but the $10 didn't even matter to me. It was the way the manager handled the situation as I have to deal with my allergic reaction. Don't ever argue with your customers especially when you have caused harm to their wellbeing! If they apologized and made sure I was ok and that they would make sure it didn't happen again, and tried to make things right without arguing I would have understood that mistakes happen and hope they would learn from it. I definitely would have come back if this was handled appropriately, but because of the poor customer service, insensitivity, and arguing I will NEVER come to this location again and will make sure I tell everyone I know not to as well!",

I got the pick two deal (full sandwich & soup). I got the chicken pesto & mushroom soup and my bestie got the vegetarian with tofu & Wisconsin cheese cauliflower soup, both of these were GREAT. My chicken pesto sandwich was very juicy and cheesy and my mushroom soup was veered good with chunks of mushroom and veggies . The roll and the free chocolate covered strawberries definitely hits the spot too. I also really like that they label EVERYTHING with the calories, even their freshly pressed orange juice! You can definitely make it as healthy and unhealthy as you want it to be.",

My all time favorite is Turkey bacon avocado panini sans bacon. For soup, I always choose between Wisconsin cauliflower or wild mushroom bisque. I have tried other vegetarian soups as well, Garden chowder is just fine and tomato basil soup is avoidable. The complimentary chocolate dipped strawberry wins my heart every time. Their house made drinks are also very fresh and flavorful. Taste to find your flavor before you fill up your cup!",

    "text": "Personally, I used to love Zupas but occasionally coming back my last couple of visits the customer service isn't on point and cleanliness seems to be a concern.   I understand how the ordering process works very clearly. I usually order a chipotle salad and instead of getting chicken, beans, and bell peppers I sub it with two portions of pork (2 regular veggie/ fruit ingredients on the line = 1 protein when substituting). The line server puts a red toothpick in my salad indicating to the cashier to charge me for an extra protein but I explained to her that I'm not getting any beans and bell peppers so it was completely subbed and she said I could tell the cashier. Confused I continued down the line and ordered my yucatan soup. I observed the sandwich, salad, and soup station using their sanitation rags to clean the counters and coolers while TOUCHING mine and another customers food. There's sanitizer or soap/ water on those rags I would appreciate it if that not get mixed in my food... anyways proceeding down the line I get asked my order at cashier. My fiance got a bit confused and accidentally said he got a salad with his soup (he claimed my chipotle salad) so when he explained to the hospitality manager that was my salad and he actually got a crab sandwich she threw some attitude and told the cashier to delete the entire order because we didn't tell them the correct order in a very sassy way. I'm not dumb to realize a frustrated server being passive with us to her cashier. I get it sometimes people getting their orders wrong is stressful working on the other side BUT my fiance and I apologized and she still made us feel guilty for messing up the order/ holding up the line. I don't mind the process of ordering where I have to repeat myself but I have an issue with staff, specifically the hospitality manager making me feel bad about my order if I accidentally make a mistake. I was charged for an extra protein and I had to explain what I got to the manager and cashier and what I subbed out. After confirming with the initial person who took my order (at Salas station), which was another manager they took off the extra charge. If line servers had proper training that could have been avoided.   I don't think I'll ever come back again. Too much stressful experiences during the ordering process and I don't like knowing that I'm paying a rude manager's check with my service.",

    "text": "I've been going to Zupa's regularly for about a year. Their salads and soups are great.  No complaints whatsoever about the quality and flavor.  Salad ingredients always fresh.  Soups very tasty.   My complaint is more with the service and general attitude.  I was reading through other Yelp reviews regarding this location and its interesting as to how many other reviewers had the same experience and complaints that I have.   First:  General stingy attitude.  Not sure how else to describe it.  It's annoying when they measure in lettuce and then, after I think they are ready to pass the bowl to the topping station, the take out a few leafs of the lettuce.  Really?  Did they really exceed some limit?  It just feels really nit-picky and stingy.  Then when they add the toppings it's again annoying when they are so deliberate in ensuring that each topping does not exceed whatever amount is mandated by management.  It just feels stingy and cheap and unpleasant.    As with other reviewers, I have the exact same complaint of some others of the staff wiping the stainless counter with what looked to be an inappropriate cloth.    Finally, I've decided that the place is overpriced.  Although the salad quality is great, I've reached the end of my patience with this whole stingy attitude. Tired of all of the micro measurements and truly absurd level of fussing with whether an extra kernel of corn has been disbursed.  I'm now going to Jason's Deli where, for the same price, I can make my own salad without all of this micro measurement attitude.  At Zupa's it's this slow-motion, ultra-deliberate, mechanical experience in the food line that is uncomfortable.  The staff are like robots.   I may still go to Zupa's now and then, and although the quality and flavor of the food is great, it's a bit too pricey given the serving size. Plus the attitude of the staff and the counter/station experience is both stressful and annoying.",

I understand that Zupas is definitely not a high end restaurant, but when managers are stingy with little things, even at McDonald's, it really leaves me with a bad taste.  My experience:   They were out of noodles for my soup, I said \"that's okay, would it be possible to get more soup in my cup? (Pretty much the soup is only half of the container)\"  The girl looks at the manager, then says: \"sorry, I can't do that, but I can replace it with something else\"  I said: \"okay, could I get croutons instead?\"  Girl: \"Sure, let me ask my manager\",  I see her manager telling her no, Girl comes back: \"Sorry I can't do that\", closes the lid for the soup, put is on the side and leaves.  Like, are you serious??? I don't care about the lack of croutons, is the fact that a manager can be so greedy?! Like girl, the croutons are not coming out of your paycheck and what kind of customer experience are you giving when you don't have a ingredient but don't want to replace it with a cheaper one?  Really disappointed on this place.",

The simply put in one ladle full for the 1/2 and two for the full. We always get our order to go, and just to make it worth our money, we sit and refill our drink.   It's a shame because the food is delicious. Their tomato basil soup is the best I've had. The salads are very well crafted as well. Like another reviewer said, they are very consistent with what goes on them and how much goes on. I do love that they include a roll and chocolate covered strawberry with each order, but it still isn't enough to warrant the high prices.   Also, every single time I've come here, they are out of tofu and have to make more. If this is the case, why not just prep more every day?",

Parking lot shared with other business' next to it. It's huge inside and really clean! I tried the Cuban and the clam chowder. I haven't had chowder that good since I was in San Diego! The Cuban is so good. That was the first time I've ever had a cuban sandwich and it was amazing. I feel like the pickles made it a little weird, but in a good way. When we walked in, everyone was so busy but the line died down so quickly. It's so weird because as soon as someone walked in, 7 more would follow out of no where! So don't let the lines scare you off, because within 2 minutes you'll be in the front! Their chocolate covered strawberries are amazing too! Can't wait to come back here.",

    "text": "I've been here twice and I enjoyed both visits. Both times I have gotten the pick 2 combo with a sandwich and soup. I've been wanting to try a salad but it seems that most salads follow the formula of sugary dressing + fresh fruit + candied nuts/dried fruit and I am not down with sweet salads.  Today I ordered the fresh herb chicken sandwich. I am sensitive to mayo (it's gross, lets be real) and I asked the employee behind if the chicken was covered in mayo and he said no after I asked twice using different words and... it was covered in mayo. I hate to complain so I ate it anyways and it was pretty OK. The fresh avocado, bacon and soft bread made up for the unsavory ingredient, though I won't make that mistake twice.  The soups have been, by far, my favorite part of coming to Cafe Zupas. They allow you to have a sample of the soups when choosing which almost makes it *harder* to decide. Today I went with the mushroom bisque and it was so fresh and delicious. It seems like most mushroom recipes come with truffle oil these days which, if not done right, tastes like rubber, but this soup was obviously super fresh. It didn't taste weighed down with heavy creams and butters too, it was simply perfect.  Lastly, there is no calorie count for any of their items. I've lost 40 lbs over the past year, my BF has lost 65 and we aren't obsessive, but we are mindful and their lack of nutritional info irks me. I'm not scared off of higher calorie meals and indulge weekly, but it would be good to know if my \"healthy lunch\" was really a caloric splurge. Maybe soon? Then 5 stars!",

My husband and I went in at 4PM and were welcomed by the friendliest staff. Their menu is great. My husband ordered the kale salad which they made in front of him. I ordered the vegetarian sandwich and chicken enchilada chili soup which were both to kill for!!! Not to mention every meal ordered included a free chocolate dipped strawberry. It's safe to say Zupas is my better replacement of Jason's Deli and Panera Bread. Better food, service, and prices!!! I can't wait to come back! I'm so disappointed this place only has 3.5 stars on Yelp!",

I had the Pick 2 deal for $8.79 which I chose the Honey Bacon Club Panini and 1/2 of the Citrus Spinach Salad.  It was great!   The salad was especially amazing!   It had a Blood Orange Vinaigrette, which was one of the best salad dressings I've ever had.  It included Mandarin Oranges, Baby Spinach, Dried Cranberries, and Goat Cheese.  The sandwich had Turkey, Ham, Bacon and Muenster Cheese with Honey Mustard.  Both were very good.  The service was VERY FAST and they had plenty of help.  The place was very clean.  The ingredients were very fresh as well.  The downside of it is that the place isn't well lit at night.  I've driven by it many times thinking they were closed.  However, they stay open until 9pm, except on Friday & Saturday when they're open until 10pm.  They need some outside lights.  One thing VERY DISCOURAGING is that they are closed on Sundays.  Lucky for their employees I guess, but I don't get how chain businesses do this?!    Other than that, it was great and will be a very frequent dinner spot.  Downgraded this tonight from four stars to three stars.  The food is incredible, but we tried to call in an order for six people tonight at work.  Their policy is no call-in orders, unless you place an advance order before 10am on the day you want the order.  I can understand if you have 15-20 people or more, but what kind of casual restaurant can't prepare a call-in order for six people in 30-45 minutes?!   That is beyond ridiculous.  Your kind of business should thrive on phone in orders.  If you don't have the personnel to handle it, then hire more people for that process.  Also, why is it that you can only order on-line in Utah?!  They have A LOT of work to do in this area.",

Today I ordered A pulled pork and avocado with honey cilantro on white bread and a lobster bisque. When I opened the package the sandwich barely had any ingredients. It looked like they put one scoop of meat in the middle of a whole sandwich and barely put enough the cover one bite from each side when cut in half with a slice or two of avocado and barely a spoon full of cabbage. Like I said. Nothing like the menu pictures. Totally disappointed especially after being so tempted with how delicious it was then the soup had only one chunk of lobster when the menu states a chunky lobster soup. Yea right.

In the center of the dining area they have a large drink station with soft drinks and other beverages along with premium flavored syrups to flavor beverages.  They have a variety of choices including soups, salads, sandwiches, and protein bowls.  Everything is made fresh and to order.  Their \"try two\" option allows you a smaller portion of any two items to try.  This time I tried the chicken enchilada soup and the California protein bowl.  The soup was excellent  Rich flavor with just enough spice and some crunchy tortilla strips on top.  The protein bowl was also excellent and was sort of like a Cobb salad with eggs, chicken, and bacon with a light dressing.  The meals come with a small piece of bread and one of their signature chocolate-dipped strawberries.    Overall, this was an excellent meal and was much better than Panera (in my opinion).  It's perfect for lunch or a lighter dinner!",

My kid likes their fruit cups and chocolate covered strawberries. Their options are very tasty too. I don't think I've ever disliked any of their soups, salads or sandwiches.",

Most sourdoughs and ciabattas are accidentally vegan so it would be pretty easy to carry 1 vegan option of bread.   They have a vegetarian sandwich that has tofu on it but when ordering a salad you cannot sub tofu for meat.  So not only do you NOT get a discount for no meat/no cheese, when getting a salad, but you cannot get tofu instead. Such a bummer.   We were told the only vegan dressing is herb vinaigrette.  Only vegan soup is the chickpea vegetable soup.    Would also be nice to have either some information online, or marked on the menu, of which items are vegan or can me made vegan.",

I like places that give me actual plates are when I dine in, however here they still give out plastic cutlery (why not just silverware). The menu offers various soups, salads and sandwiches that are made to order. Staff is friendly and the dining room is kept actively clean with a staff member cleaning throughout service. Specialty refreshing teas are offered as well (I enjoyed the turmeric green tea) at no additional cost. I had a soup and sandwich combo: lobster and red pepper soup, with a crab and avocado melt sandwich. They have delish dessert options, but include a chocolate covered strawberry with your combo.  Another nice perk is that you can dine at the 'recharge bar' where you can eat and charge your devices. I look forward to coming back.",

When we got to the front of the line, the lady asked us how many for the Togo order. As soon as we said we had 6 orders, the lady's face and attitude automatically changed. She made a comment saying \"next time you have a big order like that, you can call us so we can get it ready\" with a big attitude and a passive aggressive tone to it. When I explained to her that it was because according to yelp, open hours is not til 11am, we didn't call. And she then argued saying \"well our Togo opens at 8am\" and when I informed her that it doesn't indicate that information on yelp, she said \"well next time you can do that cause it's usually a 30 minute wait\"   What is the difference if 6 different people came in at the same time?! And what's the point of giving the customers attitude? I can bring my business somewhere else if we're gonna be punished for making a big order. Was I supposed to say sorry that my whole family likes your food that we all wanted to get one ?!?",

    "text": "Here's the thing that we all love about Zupas, it has the entire ambiance thing going for them. When you walk in it looks clean, there are smiling faces attached to every employee, and the marketing/signage is bright. It all has the appearance of \"clean food\" because eating clean food makes things brighter. But clean is more than just in appearance. You can have on a clean shirt, but not shower for 4 days. ( I wouldn't suggest it, but you get my drift) Being clean is more that what it looks like, it's also a practice.   So imagine my surprise when I went into the bathroom and found post-it notes on the sink and soap dispenser Photos attached) informing all that the sink was not working. *GASP* so, Zupas you're just admitting that you LOOK clean, but you're employees are walking out of the BATHROOM without washing their hands and returning to work. Although there is a sign attached to the mirror that mandates that employees MUST wash their hands before returning to work. So as I'm walking out the bathroom, verbally expressing to myself--or so I thought-- how disgusting that situation is, an employee WALKS OUT THE HANDICAP STALL and passes the sink without a pause.   I take the cleanliness of my food seriously and without poop/pee or whatever else type of germs/residue that could be attached to an employees unwashed hands.   The manager should be ashamed at the lack of problem solving on this fiasco. S/he should have ran out to buy waterless soap, hand sanitizer, hell, even those bulk bottles of mini waters to place by the sink. ANYTHING was better than doing nothing and apologizing for an \"inconvenience\" which was in actuality a health hazard.   I'm not returning.",

It is a new location, so it has been in pristine condition for each of my visits. The food has been delicious for what it is: fast-casual soup, salads, and sandwiches. The staff has been polite and courteous with each visit and the food has been correct with each order (typically my order ends up being for 3-5 people when I make a food run for our office so this is a somewhat important issue for me).  Nice touches that I appreciate include the flavor syrups for the fountain drinks and the free sample cups for the soups (I hope these won't get abused and taken away as I love adding a pump of vanilla to my root beer and sampling a new soup with each visit since they have so many).",

    "text": "This was my second visit to a Cafe Zupas location and it was prompted by their Grand Opening mailer for 50% off your order. I brought Ruben, my mom, and my brother to take advantage of this fantastic deal, plus, they had never been to Zupas.  There's still construction going on in this new plaza and it was insanely busy, so it was a little tricky maneuvering around the lot. Parking was also sparse, which made it even more chaotic. I'm sure they'll be rather busy as long as these mailers are running!  The lowdown on CZ:   ORDERING: Go straight to the line. The menu is available above the food stations, but also available as convenient to-go menus along the line. They have sandwiches, salads, soups, and desserts. That's the simple part. Making a decision may take a little more time since there are 13 sandwiches, 12 salads, and 10 soups. Sandwiches are sold whole, but soups and salads are available as large or half options. There's a very popular \"Try 2 Combo\" for $8.79 that offers a sandwich with a half salad OR half soup (it's also the best deal). When it's your turn at the counter, they'll ask you if you're having a sandwich or a salad. Then you're moved down the line and asked if you want soup. Everything is prepped as you're walking. As your meal is being wrapped up with a piece of bread and chocolate-dipped strawberry, they verify your items before you pay at the register (This is also when you choose your beverage options).  BEVERAGES: There's a beverage station with your usual fountain sodas and freshly-made teas and lemonades (all sweetened with honey). This area is also home to utensils, napkins, butter, etc. (There are salt and black pepper grinders at the tables)  SEATING: \"Please place your order before reserving a seat\" It's a quick-service restaurant and turnover is equally fast (we were at our table for just 25 minutes). It was really busy when we arrived, but we were still able to find a table for four immediately after receiving our food, so I wouldn't worry about not having a seat/table. Though, I'm sure it could get busier and I don't know what they do in that situation.  The verdict:  Turkey Bacon Avocado Panini: Turkey, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, Muenster cheese, and housemade honey mustard. First, the sandwich was a MESS. There was avocado everywhere (especially outside the sandwich). Also, I'm certain it was an avocado spread rather than actual avocado. The bread was not crunchy or warm like you'd except from a panini (especially when it's pressed to order, unless this was prepared in advance). There was also very little or no salt; surprising when there's bacon present (speaking of bacon, it was flabby and sad). I'm assuming they purposely don't salt their foods and allow you to season it yourself? Basically, the sandwich lacked much-needed texture and seasoning. Even with the addition of salt and pepper, it was still just okay.  Honey Bacon Club Panini: Turkey, ham, bacon, tomatoes, Muenster cheese, and housemade honey mustard. Again, the bread lacked crunch. Its flavor was decent and I like that the honey really stood out without being overwhelming or too sweet. It also didn't need additional salt. I didn't love this sandwich either, but I enjoyed it much more than the other panini.  Roasted Red Pepper and Lobster Soup: This is a neat combination of two ingredients I love and lighter than its described (creamy). It had a nice lobster fragrance that you could really taste and there were several pieces of lobster (though they had an odd texture). However, it was just okay.   Chicken Enchilada Chili: Red & green enchilada sauces, chicken, black beans, and Southwestern vegetables, topped with tortilla strips. A bit thin for a chili since it was more soup than stew, but the flavors were good. I would order this one again.  Asian Citrus Chicken: Baby field greens, housemade yuzu miso vinaigrette, chicken, sugar snap peas, edamame, baby cucumbers, tri-color peppers, mandarin oranges, cashews, wonton strips, and black sesame seeds. I was pleased that the salad wasn't overly dressed with vinaigrette (I hate drowning salads) and thought it was decent. The mandarin oranges were super mushy, but I'm not a fan of them in salads anyway.  The sandwiches are small, but the soups and salads are generous. The accompanying bread is pretty good, though it would be soo much better toasted (and butter; I forgot about butter)! I didn't eat the chocolate-covered strawberry this time, but I remember it being good (Belgian milk chocolate).  I'm not overly impressed with the food. It's wonderful that everything is housemade, but the quick-serve model is compromising the end-product (soft paninis, soggy ingredients). It is a great option for healthier food when you're on the go and I know that's their thing, but I prefer a made-to-order product that may take a little more time.",

I adore the decor and how they pair your food with a bread roll and a chocolate dipped strawberry. Touche! I usually order a sandwich and pick a new soup. There's a variety of soups although I've come to favor the Red Pepper Lobster Bisque quite fondly! Seating is simple to find, as well is parking. There isn't wifi, although you wont't need it! Talk to the person you're dining with if you can find time to utter words in between devouring your delicious panini! There's lots to choose from when it comes to drinks! I love the infused water drinks. It's nice to have a healthier on the go option when I get tired of my meal prep! Awesome poosum! You guys rocks! Keep up the great work!!! and THANK YOU!",

If you stick with the sandwiches you can have a small cheap lunch. But if you get the soups and salads, it can add up with all the add ons that they charge 65 cents each.  I liked the Cuban so much I went and ordered more sandwiches to go for later. They screwed up my order, and gave away one of my sandwiches. They gave me a dessert for the trouble. A Million Pound bar or something like that. If you eat the whole thing in one sitting you will gain a million pounds. It's very rich. Gf liked it but it took her almost a week to finish it. Coconut, chocolate chips, peanut butter on some kind of brownie or graham cracker base. The free chocolate covered strawberry was enough for me.",

However the manager was very rude and abrupt. I'm guessing since we can at 9pm, she had long day and just wanted to go home. As it being my first time, my son wanted  a caesar salad, she said we dont have stuff that simple and walked away to do something else and left me standing there. So I went back to table and let wife order before I was rude back. Is it really that hard to have customer service? Really blows me away these walk up places will put out a TIP cup but do the absolute minimum in service...If the lady that manages place actually sees this, being nice and giving customer service might actually get people to return!!!",

They have hot sauces at the other places.  Go elsewhere imo",

I have tried many many things at Cafe Zuppas including:   Strawberry Harvest Chicken Salad Garden Chop Salad with Blue Cheese Cherry Balsamic Chicken Salad Glazed Chicken Chipotle Salad Tomato Basil with Orzo Pasta Soup Wild Mushroom Bisque Soup Chicken Enchilada Chili  Roasted Red Pepper & Lobster Hungarian Beef Stew (World Tour Special) Honey Cilantro Carnitas  Ultimate Grilled Cheese Cuban Grilled Pork  Clearly I keep coming back. While some of the aforementioned items were less amazing than others, none of them were bad.   I read some previous reviews mentioning salads being too wet or too sweet, but in my opinion that's your poor review of the menu. I found the Glazed Chicken Chipotle salad to be too wet but I take responsibility for not asking for lite dressing knowing they include two dressings in the salad. I don't think that means Zuppas makes a terrible salad. If you don't like a sweet salad or salad dressing don't order a menu salad, you have the option to \"create your own\"   While I do agree the layout was poorly conceived and it's annoying snaking through tables full of people during lunch rush, the amount of fresh food for the price made me get over it fast.   Simply put, I love Zuppas and can't wait to try more menu items.",

Bonus incentive to try it was the 50% off the ENTIRE MEAL coupon I received in the mail. We finally went to try it out tonight. My daughters and I are vegetarians and my son is not. I very much appreciated the number of vegetarian items on the menu. We ordered three Ultimate Grilled Cheese, one Cuban, two cauliflower soups, one mushroom soup and one chicken tortilla soup. For dessert my girls got the chocolate mousse cake and chocolate hazelnut creme brulee. Of course we all got the chocolate covered strawberries. Everything we got was exceptional. I am very picky about soups. The cauliflower soup was perfectly seasoned and the mushroom soup was so good my daughter wanted to lick the bowl. The Ultimate Grilled cheese sandwiches reminded me of a caprese salad in flavor. It was wonderful dipped in the cauliflower soup by the way. I really liked the small pieces of bread provided with the meals, they were perfect for sopping up the soup in the bottom of the bowls. The desserts were divine! It was a tad confusing when we first walked in, having never been in a Cafe Zupas before, but the staff was very nice and quick to help us figure out what we wanted and they got us through the line quickly. I liked seeing the menu outside before we walked in as well. That was extremely helpful in our decision making process because we had some idea what was on the menu before we even walked in. I would suggest maybe moving a few tables/booths around so new customers know where to go when they first walk in, but otherwise, I am definitely impressed. My family will be returning here often. I might even have to sneak in for a bowl of soup while my kids are at school every once in a while. :) The only downfall... Expensive.",

    "text": "I love zupas, and have gone to every one in this city. This particular one has messed up my order almost every time I have been there. When you order, they try to rush you down the line to pay. I now tell them no, and that I want to watch them make my food because past orders have been incorrect. The times I do this, this employees are clearly unhappy with me about it. Which I'm not sure why considering I'm just making sure they do it the right way (which many times I have to tell them that they aren't). Cafe zupas has great food, and it's also a little pricey for a small little soup, salad and sandwich cafe. Which I don't mind paying extra because they're ingredients are always super fresh and delicious. But I do mind paying extra when I get all the way home and (for example) realize that my \"chicken\" salad has no chicken. Need to train Their employees better. Hoping another one opens up soon that's by where I live so I don't keep chancing that this one will learn their recipes/ingredients.",

I ordered the Pacific Cobb Salad when the employee scooped my chicken into the small scooper it went uneven and the manager said to her to take some of that chicken out and make sure it's even with the scoop ,folks this is a small scoop..lol.. They are so scared to give you an extra crumble of blue cheese.. Wow! Forget about the kids chicken strip meal. Looks like a frozen piece of breaded chicken they throw into the toaster oven. The interior of the building is nice enough but 1 time was enough. Good Luck hope you can turn this around. Oh by the way don't expect to use silverware , plastic only!",

    "text": "Wow absolute terrible customer service, I came here for the first time with my mom instead of going to Egg works because we wanted something different. But I can honestly say that I would of preferred Egg works. It was my first time & I had no idea how the menu worked & that seemed to upset each and every worker here except for I believe his name was Tyler. Great job on being patient and having a pleasant smile despite the fact that I asked 101 questions.. First and last time here. What makes this worst is the feeling of not even wanting to sit down and enjoy your food because of how your first interaction was handled. And as I'm still sitting here Jessica your \"manager\" is staring at us rolling her eyes. Here's a tip Jessica lead by example, don't talk about customers while they are still here at least give me that respect. This is your job if you are that unhappy then you should try finding a better job that suites your poor customer service. You represent this company by being the manager and today you failed at that. I understand bad shifts and bad days but I will never understand someone being upset by people not knowing how something works or asking questions.",

Quality of the food is excellent , however , the staff is not at all on the same page and could use some serious training ! The toppings for the salads which are supposed to be measured can vary quite a bit depending on who is serving you . Sometimes , you have to buy 2 extra of a topping just to get a normal amount ! Last week , I picked up to go . They were slow . 4 people working on 2 salads is probably NOT necessary ! They had me so confused . I come home to realize That my husbands salad is also drenched in vinegar like I had asked for on mine along with his side of ranch . We have 4 kids , I couldn't run back to have it redone so there goes an over $8 salad in the trash ! The next night , I let the manager know what had happened and didn't even get an apology ! Tonight , prob made me the most mad , the portions vary so much that just to get 1 serving of chicken my husband had to request 3 . A large salad has 7 toppings , so he had 1 left then paid for 2 additional . The girl decided she would  charge him for 2 additional proteins instead of regular toppings which are $1 more each one then regular . This place needs a game plan! If you want to ration out toppings maybe you need a real scooper or serving size instead of a tiny Spoon whose portions vary by the person dishing them out !",

My stomach is still recuperating. My husband got lobster bisque (I didn't eat) and is now vomiting so on two separate occasions we got sick. I didn't think it was from the soup but for sure now we know! So, buyer beware! We will be making formal complaints because I'm sure many others have gotten sick! #bubbleguts  I called the manager and explained to them what happened and they had nothing to say but sorry and that they check the temperatures of the soups. Not much help at all!   I will never go back to any Cafe Zupas! If I could give zero stars I would.",

We're a bit spoiled here in Vegas with all these great places having multiple locations at every corner of the valley - I wanted to shave off 10 minutes of driving to their Lake Mead location.   With every new restaurant opening, there are sure to be some growing pains (as other reviewers have pointed out), but I think this location still has the same great service, affordable/high quality food options, and friendly atmosphere of other locations I've been to. I get what I always get at other locations - mushroom bisque and nuts about berries salad, and my husband picks up the delicious honey cilantro carnitas with whatever soup looks good that day. My husband picked up some food for me to go the other day and he said the place was packed and even sent me a picture of the line, so be aware if going during lunch hours. He said the line still went by rather quickly and my food was still hot and neatly packaged upon arrival. I really appreciated that the salad dressing was put on the side so my greens weren't soggy. I'll be coming here a lot as part of my commitment to trying to eat healthier, but we'll see how long that holds up this year.",

    "text": "So I noticed some fellow Yelpers checking in here and since it just down the street from me just had to try it.  I love deli food and the thought of another good deli near me was too much to pass up on.  We each got a soup and sandwich combo and a couple of salads. I had the Turkey Bacon Avocado with the Wild Mushroom Soup.  The wife got the BBQ Pork with the Lobster Bisque and the daughter got the Crab Sandwich with the Cauliflower soup.    The Wild mushroom was very good.  Creamy and with those amazing tasty mushrooms.  It was exactly what I expected.  The Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwich was also very good.  The bread was still crisp and the turkey and bacon were pretty tasty.  It had a decent amount of avocado which was prefect as it added to the overall taste but didn't turn the sandwich into a mushy mess.  I did try the Lobster Bisque and Cauliflower soups and they were both very good.  The Lobster Bisque was chunky with more lobster than I expected.  I would definitely order it again.  The Cauliflower soup was creamy and surprisingly delicious.  I did not think I was going to like it but hey you just never know sometimes.  I did get  taste of the crab sandwich and it was pretty good too and would gladly order it again.  I didn't try the BBQ Pork sandwich but according to the wife it was nothing to write home about.  She said it was OK.   We got the Mango and Asian Chicken salads and although they were good I don't think they are a good value so I will stick with Soup and Sandwiches next time.       Since they had just recently opened I am not sure if the inside was done but it had a very casual feel to it.  I would call it modern industrial but hey I am no designer so not sure what they are going for as far as looks.  The staff was super friendly but too plentiful.  I would assume this is due to recently opening and doing OJT with new employees.  I ill be back but wait a month or so to see how this place matures.  A good addition to Rainbow and the SW of Vegas.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place since I saw that it had opened its doors.   Sadly I was more disappointed then impressed.  :(  I got their combo... Full sandwich with either a half salad or half soup.  I got the turkey with bacon and avocado.  The sandwich was decent. It didn't blow me away. I figured that the bacon would still be a little crispy.... Sadly no it was limp.... And it looked like it had been sitting in their reach ins for sometime.  And the turkey was just your normal sliced turkey u can get at a grocery store. Now the real disappointment.... The avocados. I love avocados and that was one of the main reasons why I got this and instead of being fresh avocado slides.... It looked like they had just smeared guacamole on it. Very sad about that. :( but the flavor was overall decent.  (3/5)  The soup was another disappointment. I call it a soup even though they call it a chowder because it was NOT a chowder. When I get a chowder I expect that it's going to be thick and chunky.  It was brothy like a chicken noodle soup. And it was SALTY. very very SALTY. The soup comes with a piece of bread.... They call it a baguette... But it was just a loaf of bread in the shape of a baguette. :/  even with adding the bread into the soup it was SALTY.... But I was hungry so I ate it.... I got the new England clam soup.... The flavor besides the saltiness was barely ok.  There was no potatoes... Just lots and lots of celery. And the pieces of clam were miniscule.  This was a total miss. (1/5)  Best thing about this visit was the drink station. They have 4 upgraded drinks included when u buy a normal soda fountain drink. They are all natural made with honey instead with normal sugar or sugar substitutes.  I tried 2 and both were well balanced and not overly sweet.  If you do not like honey I would not recommend these drinks as the honey is very obvious. (5/5)  Free chocolate dipped strawberries.... (5/5)... You can't really complain about free....  Ambiance.... It was very clean and the staff were awesome. Very friendly.  But I will knock a star off since it was COLD in there. This is coming from someone who has her thermostat at home set to 68.... It was COLD.  (4/5)  Overall I would like to give them 1 more try.... And see if the food quality improves.  But I won't be rushing back here. :(",

The service is generally pretty quick but I have had some issues with them mixing up my order or trying to charge me for something I didn't order, but I think it's because the process of how they make your order is pretty confusing.  Their ingredients are super fresh and yummy. I love the cauliflower soup..it doesn't sound good but trust me it is amazing. The pork sandwich is really good too. I think I've tried everything there and I'm usually pretty impressed. A bit overpriced in my opinion but you get giant portions.  My only real complaint is that they got rid of the Maui Tropical Chicken salad. That salad was to die for and what kept me coming back. I used to go there all the time but I now I rarely visit because they don't have it. I try to ask for recommendations of something similar but the employees are typically clueless, it's okay, haha. Wish they'd bring it back or something similar!!",

    "text": "I'm not sure why this location has gotten such bad ratings so far. Yes they are newly opened, and the staff are new, but when we went, service was very fast, everyone knew what they were doing, and the food was good!  It was very busy when we went and the line moves fast. The main thing that bothered me about this place is that it's cramped. Most people will walk in the front door but the tables are really jam packed in there, so it's hard to get to the back to get in line. There is also a side door that would be a more logical entrance but I think most don't know it's there.  Also after ordering, most people will turn to the right to walk away, which puts you behind the drink station. You then have to walk back around it, which in many cases you will be walking across the people walking in, which again will be trying to walk past people getting their drinks. I think they should put a big sign on the front door to use the side door as the entrance, and use the front door as the exit. If this place continues to be this busy, I think it would control the flow of traffic much better. Or they could turn the drink station around, which I think would be a great idea, but probably out of the question.  As far as the food, prices are very good if you don't go overboard with the add ons, which are $0.69 each. But sandwiches are less than $6 each, and are small, but the size is equal to its price IMO. We tried the Cubano, Turkey spinach artichoke (TSA), Turkey bacon avocado (TBA), and Chicken salad. The best is the Cubano. It has the most amount of meat and the pork is really tender. It's the same pork as what's used in the Pulled Pork and Cilantro Pork, though I have yet to try those. The runner up was the TSA, refreshing yet satisfying.  Every order comes with a small chocolate dipped strawberry. If that's not enough for you for dessert, they do have several house made desserts that are VERY sweet!  Soups are also very tasty. We tried the lobster bisque and the clam chowder. I like the lobster bisque better. It has a bit of a spicy kick to it. The clam chowder had big chunks of clam but was a little on the salty side.",

I have been to 3 locations in Las Vegas areas previously and had NO issues substituting one ingredient on my sandwich. I was informed on my last visit there are NO substitutions allowed on their sandwiches, even if I was willing to pay an upcharge. Customers are only allowed to remove items. I simply asked for spinach leaves instead of cheese on my sandwich. I find this policy very troubling for those who have food allergies and would like an alternative ingredient on their sandwich. The employees behind the counter were rude, and tossed my to-go bag at me without giving me any eye contact. I called another location to verify this policy which they confirmed. I will NOT support or return to zupas anymore.",

I enjoy the sandwich and salad combo and would prefer to get the large salad.  They're is no way for them to just charge me the extra $2 for the large salad and insist on charging me for the salad and sandwich separately which negates the combo discount.  I'm willing to pay more for more food but don't like feeling taken advantage of. You guys are leaving money on the table everytime I visit. Doesn't seem like smart business practice. In a world that pushes you to upsize everything, not sure why I'm getting punished here for trying to upsize my salad.",

I am  used to Panera serving size so I was delighted to see that the pick two came with a whole sandwich and a generous portion of soup.   I got the pesto chicken sandwich and the only negative thing I have to say is how I really wanted more pesto. The bread was crunchy & soft and the chicken was smothered in cheese and topped with sprouts. Very good!   I choose the cauliflower soup and oh my goodness, I know cauliflower doesn't sound great, it was fantastic! Creamy, cheesy, and seasoned well!   My husband opted to have cheddar and bacon topped on the soup which made it that much better!   The pick two also came with a slice of baguette bread (too soft, I like a crusty bread) and a chocolate dipped strawberry.   We will be back for sure!",

I do love the atmosphere and I do love the location, but the food was just okay. I felt as though this place didn't live up to the hype that others have created for it. Maybe it's because I am not a health nut and that is why I didn't favor it. The food didn't make me sick so they get one star for that, the service was great, so that's another star, and a third star because the food is supposed to be healthy for you and is made with fresh ingredients.   I ordered: Honey bacon club with New England clam chowder  = The sandwich was 'meh' and the chowder was too watery  Husband ordered:  BBQ pulled pork with chicken enchilada chili soup = The sandwich had a nice tang to it, but isn't a 'must-try' by any means; soup was decently good, hate that add-ons are $0.69 each for just a sprinkle of shredded cheese  I personally would not come back, unless I was outnumbered by a group of friends that wanted to go here, but try it for yourself!",

The chocolate covered strawberries Included was so nice too and super good. I ended up ordering a couple more to take home for my family to try.

Today, I ordered the Turkey Spinach Artichoke sandwich and the BBQ Chicken Salad. You get a decent portion and it fills you up.   I like to come here for lunch and even a late lunch. This place does get pretty busy and crowded though. I feel like there's too many tables for the space they have. Other than that, the staff are friendly and provide good service.

You also get a small piece of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry.   I wish the cafe was a little less crowded with how the tables are arranged. I feel like when I'm eating, I'm literally right next to someone at the next table. Regardless, I'd recommend this place for anyone who loves sandwiches, salads and soups!

They have infusion drinks available and the Orange Berry Infusion is my favorite!

So couldn't help but wonder if it is the BS in the price hikes or the not so nice line workers. Let's go with the prices...well if you want an \"add on\" its ridiculous. We had asked for bell peppers to be added to a salad and those were extra all 4 little tidbits were an extra charge. It's so crazy that you would charge almost a $1 for 4 little tidbits of peppers not even a spoon full. And croutons those were extra too, all 5 pieces. And they don't yell you all that is going to be extra.  If you don't want something they normally add do they give you a break in price...no they do not. So don't stray from the menu. Just sad that they would charge for such little amounts. Had it been a normal amount that they would give you as if it was part of that item normally then it wouldn't have been a big deal. And to top it off the person checking us out spilled some of our soup but did they add back in what they spilled, nope. So less soup for you!",

It was smaller than what I expected.  I paid $10 for my 2 combo meal which also came with a slice of bread and a chocolate strawberry.  If you total up all the items together id say its worth the price.  The salad was also nice.  The light vinaigrette worked well with the strawberries, apples, nuts, and dried cranberries.  The tables were clean, and i enjoyed the music playing.  All in All Zuppas is my sort of spot to eat at.  A decent healthy food spot thats not too expensive.  Id recommend you give them a try... Its not a spot ill crave but more to just get a quick healthy meal and relax for a bit ;-)",

It's pretty cheap too but if you're eating with one other person it's about $20 which about the same as sweet tomatoes for 2 people so I'd say the better deal would be to go to sweet tomatoes but I mean if you want fast but healthy food id definitely come here though! My favorite soups from here would have to be tomato basil or veggie quinoa and the best salad would have to be chicken chipotle or the healthiest is the kale salad. Best fruit one is the nuts about berries   They also have really good house made drinks like the cucumber/basil infused water is my favorite. I also love how they give you a strawberry and bread with every order.  The service is very fast and they have a lot of good workers working for them.  The interior is decorated nicely too. The only problems I have is that the portions are so little. Like when they scoop you your soup they do one scoop and it fills only half the bowl.  One time I was ordering and the worker gave me a little too much soup and the manager told them to take some out because it was too much?  Other than that though everything else is fine. Sometimes it's too cold in here too, but other than that I'd still come back and bring my friends if we want quick healthy food",

I love clam chowder but not a fan of theirs -- most likely cause of the celery. Prefer Panera Bread's clam chowder.   I'm cycling through all their salads slowly, but so far California Protein Cobb is a winner. I've got a long way until I'm done trying more of their menu so expect an update in the future, but for now, highly recommend, especially if you just want to feel healthy when you go out to eat ;).",

It's a great environment to grab a quick bite and if you want desserts they always have these mouth-watering brownies that will just stare you down at the register!  The location is prime too! It's just off the 215 and Rainbow and during lunch and dinner it gets pretty busy down there. But for me it's the perfect place to go to if I want something semi-healthy after the gym!",

    "text": "I remember when the first one originally opened on Eastern by the 215, it was like an amazing thing. Healthy salads thats different from the usual salads and stuff. But the only downside was its location being 30 minutes, on a non-busy 215, to get to. Yeah i work near by sometimes but still not something i can get that easily. They had another location on lake mead that was more inconvenient than this location. I rarely on that side of town xD   When i heard of this location opening up, it was like a god-send XD and had answered my prayers ! (no i didnt pray for this to happen but i did hope one would open on this side of town at some point in time)   Big open location in a newly developed shopping center, across from the widely popular Arroyo Shopping Center on Rainbow and 215. Only downside is the traffic that is on Rainbow at almost all times of the day !   I had came here one day after volunteering to pick up for a few friends as we were meeting up at the office. They've never had Cafe Zupas before so it was a new experience for them. Since nowadays, everyones on the healthy route, it was the perfect pick ! And they loved it !  Their popular try 2 combo is amazing. It includes picking 2 of the following (whole sandwich, half soup, half salad), bread and chocolate dipped strawberry. All for $8.79   My usual go-to is the Strawberry Harvest Salad (fresh strawberries blanded into a house-made strawberry champagne vinaigrette tossed in house-chopped lettuce, chicken and sliced strawberries, gala apples, cranberries, fontina cheese, and candied pecans) and a sandwich (turkey bacon avocado usually)  This salad is my favorite. It was AMAZING to get this considering i was getting sick of the usual salads from like Sweet Tomatoes. Sweet and savory. Fresh and bright. Soft and crunchy. Holy crap. Lol XD i have gotten this salad ALMOST every time i've went to Cafe Zupas, except now ill probably attempt to try the entire menu again, it being in a more convenient location. Lol xD  Turkey bacon avocado sandwich. How can you say no to avocado? Usually my go-to sandwich as well. Panini style with a crispy outside.   ---------------------------  I had came here again and totally got something different this time around (as i had mentioned earlier, tryin my attempt to try the menu... XD)   California protein cobb salad with baby field greens, fresh herb vinaigrette, chicken, eggs, bacon, edamame, grape tomatoes, olives, goat cheese, and avocado. the vinaigrette is yummy. i even dipped my bread into it to get more. The salad itself seemed a little smaller than usual. Edamame gives it a nice variety of textures. Goat cheese, was not strong at all, or maybe im one of those who is ok with eating goat cheese. Lol Avocado was scooped by a baller like it was guacamole. Small amount. Wish i get more xD   Pesto chicken sandwich with home-made pesto chicken, almonds, roasted sweet red peppers, muenster cheese, sprouts and tomatoes. pesto was nice and light. You'd think this sounds like a semi-heavy sandwich but not so bad. Pretty tasty. creamy pesto and muenster cheese sounds like a good combo. tomatoes gives it a nice brightness to it all.   ------------------------------  I still have yet to try the soups but friend said the chowder wasnt bad nor is the lobster bisque. they did mention it was a bit weird that the chowder had chopped celery in it. Maybe ill try a soup next time :3 :D  definitely cravin some zupas right now :(",

There is no clear path to the area where you get in line so you're always trying to shuffle between people eating and the tables are very close together.  There is only about 6 feet in front of you when you walk in the door before you hit a table with people eating. This is the first thing I notice every time I walk in.    It's pretty obvious that Cafe Zupas trains their employees to do things in a VERY specific way. God forbid you make them stray from that training plan. They're usually very young, very robotic and don't know how to maneuver when there is a one off request. For example today I asked for a cookie with my soup and the girl looked at me like I was absolutely crazy. She said sorry you would've had to place a catering order for that, we don't do cookies with soup. I said 'do you sell cookies?' She said yes. I said okay we'll I'd like to buy a cookie ......",

The chocolate covered strawberries are a nice plus but I'd rather have a better portion for the price instead of a free strawberry. The bread they give you is not the best either.",

    "text": "Imagine a Panera bread but with a focus on Southwestern style foods. That's Cafe Zupas in the nutshell.  This place was busy. Probably still busy as of right now. It can be a little intimidating ordering, but they have menus in line and they have a huge board of what's available. They also have deals where you can get a sandwich and a 1/2 or soup or salad at a combo price. You may also want to designate a seat saver, if you are traveling in a group as seating can be hard to find at times.  I ordered the Cuban sandwich and the Chicken Enchilada Chili soup. The Cuban sandwich is my downfall. I have a tendency to order those in places where I feel they won't get it totally right. You want that nice hard pressed bread, cuts of warm ham with mustard and pickles. Well, technically, it had the correct parts but I wasn't a fan of their little twists. There was pressed bread, but it was some special bread they used. Multi-grain bread is fun and all, but not the same taste. They weren't skimpy with the ham, plenty of that to taste. The pickles were bread and butter chips. Again, technically they are both pickles, but normal dill pickles are a little tart and crisp. Bread and butter chips are soggier and much much sweeter than normal pickles. Throw on some of that citrus honey mustard and sweet red peppers and you are swimming in sweetness.  The chicken enchilada chili was pretty good but look at the name, of course it's going to be good. It's cheese city. You can get cheddar on there too (for what I assumed was a fee, everything happened so fast!) You can never have too much cheese though. You also get a chocolate dipped strawberry with your meal. I don't know the significance of the chocolate dipped strawberry but it was tasty dessert snack.  Again, this reminds me of a Panera bread with the emphasis on Southwest style foods. I do think their strengths are soups and salads more than sandwiches.",

Realized I had forgotten to use my 50% off coupon as soon as I sat down but they wouldn't honor it since I had already paid. I wouldn't normally care except the food was mediocre so $10 would've been nice. Probably won't be going back because of that.",

I have to admit I am not a soup, salad, or sandwhich person. But I do have to say your food is so fresh!! I am hooked on your chicken glazed salad! I also think the strawberry with chocolate is just added bonus to the meal.",

Every meal you order comes with a chocolate strawberry. Their bisque soups are my favorite. You can taste the freshness in their meals. Their fusion drinks are awesome too.",

    "text": "Well this place was a disappointment to say the least. It's basically a subway meets chipotle style of restaurant which I thought I would enjoy.  The lay out is a little odd that you walk through several tables to get to the line, which wasn't chained off so you have no idea where to actually go. Then when ordering, the service was subpar in my opinion. Yes it's a new place and was very busy, but a smile goes a long way. It's none of my business what is happening behind the line so things that were being discussed about coworkers shouldn't have been.  The food was decent. Nothing to rave about. My panini was tiny, squished, and greasy. The garden soup was pretty good.   Now to the reason for one star.... I spent the rest of the day and night sick to my stomach with minor food poisoning. Still as I write this my stomach is gurgling and in knots. I will never go back there again.",

    "text": "Came here on Wed at 12:45 lunch rush. Parking lot is shared with several other restaurant so very diifucult to find parking. Was incredibly loud and felt like I was being sold a used car. Only 3 people in line but they were in such a rush to serve me i really didnt get to look at their menu. Felt like \"hurry hurry hurry\". Sales staff is really hyper. I like to be quick but this was something else. Food was so so. Nothing special. Most soups were cream based. Wanted to choose my salad ingriedents but they were so hyper i didnt feel i could so i just order a 1/2 dalad and sandwich. Receive a full sandwich and was charged for this. Would be nice if they lowered the volume of music and let you have salad dressing on the side",

I did not like the chicken on the salad it was pressed chicken, gag.  I didn't mind the soup, it wasn't chowder by any means, it was warm, not hot either.  There was a lot of potatoes and clams, it tasted good.  I would go back for the salad with no chicken.",
