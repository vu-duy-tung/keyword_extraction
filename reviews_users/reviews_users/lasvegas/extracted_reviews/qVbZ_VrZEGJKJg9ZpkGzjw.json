But after getting tatted one day and being super hungry, I decided to walk over and grab something to eat and let me tell you..... THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. The workers are by far the friendliest people I've ever met in a food place. The food was cooked in a decent amount of time and it tasted great. I got a Slider Dog and the Ava Maria burger. The thing that really surprised me is the fact that the buns is actually Hawaiian King's bread. The sweetness from the bread complimented the rest of the food really well. I'm from Hawaii so using this bread made me feel like I was back home. I'm disappointed that I never tried this place out sooner. Highly recommend trying this place out if you're ever in Vegas.",

    "text": "Wowwww...stopped in here after a long day of Vegas shenanigans! One of my friends who lives in Vegas told me about this spot that just opened up, so we came to check it out.   The food was crazy good, I got the SOOO Cali, loaded with Avocado and their Spicy Basil Aoli (unreal),  and my friends both got burgers, both of which were apparently great. Food took a few minutes, but I realized after the fact it's because they grill and make everything fresh, which I absolutely loved. The service was great, as all the employees were very interactive with the customers.  As far as drinks, the two I were with both had a couple of craft beers (sorry I don't remember the names) and I had their Spicy Mule cocktail. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. In fact I had two lol. It's Vegas right?  I'm in Las Vegas several times a year, and have now found my spot to go to when I want to get away from all the overpriced tourist traps! Thank you Dog Haus!!",

Ordered an Ava Maria (burger), fries and a drink. The burger was soaked in grease and butter from bun all the way in. Starving, I pulled the burger apart and tried to just eat the meat, tasteless bland ground beef. I hate to be so harsh, I work near there and was hoping that I found my new spot. Only saving grace were the French fries but even those were just saturated with grease. So all in all I payed 13$ for a soda. Won't be back and would not recommend.",

We finally took the opportunity one day to head over and give it a try and boy were we pleased. My husband and I both ordered their Little Leaguer which consisted of their house made chili, cheddar cheese, and onions.My hot dog was the beef one and his was the vegetarian one. We honestly thought they had messed up his order because you could not even tell it was a veggie dog at all! I wish I knew what brand it was they used. Our daughter had a half hotdog and mini slider. Between the three of we shared some tater tots and french fries, oh and not to mention instead of standard buns they use those delicious sweet hawaiian rolls. I think next time I will get the little leaguer again sans cheese and add their house slaw on it to make it a good 'ol southern style hot dog. Since spending my childhood in NC I sure do enjoy a good chili and slaw dog. Can't wait to go back and try it again.",

We were both very pleased especially since it was delivered. I ordered a build your own dog with several toppings and sauces and my husband ordered the Babcock dog plus the love boat fries. I was super impressed that by the time the dogs got to us they were not at all soggy or soaked. The slaw was still crunchy and the fries were still crispy. We also received the food in under the time expected which was nice. The only thing that bummed me out was that I had asked for sauce on the side and didn't receive it but even then it wasn't a big deal. We will definitely be by in person.",

I should of known it was going to be bad when I asked how the chili was and they compared it to Wienerschnitzel   We tried the chili dog, regular hot dog, burger sliders, corn dog, fries and onion rings.  All of it was subpar.  Tasteless for the most part.  However if your lips are chapped, they will thank you, because the amount of grease that was in everything not only left my lips plenty moisturized but made me fee like I needed to apologize to my heart and arteries for the next month.

    "text": "As far as Hot Dogs go... This is the best in Las Vegas, IMO.  What makes it, (as you've read from other reviewers), is the King's Hawaiian Sweet Rolls that they use. It compliments the wide array of dog items in their menu, splendidly!  I especially like that the dogs are hormone and anti-biotic free.  I came here with my 12 year old, and he too was impressed. Though it was a little too much food for him, (which is fine since we saved it for later), cause I kinda went crazy for the two of us on the ordering. We had an order of the chili cheese tots, my son had a chili dog, (not on the menu but they were accommodating to make it for us), the Sooo Cali, and a small cheese burger. All were amazing and cooked perfectly. The service and time between ordering and receiving were great, as well!    Now, keep in mind that the portions are pretty generous and this is not for anyone who is dieting or on a Keto or paleo diet, (though you can just order a sausage or  a dog with no bun). But should you have a cheat day and don't know where to go, come here. It will be worth the extra work afterwards to put your body in that ketogenic state after consuming this goodness...   I do plan on coming back and trying other dogs and maybe just a brat just by itself with mustard...! Either way, I recommend this place and hope that you have an awesome eating experience, as we did!",

As for the food, it was fantastic! The Bad Mutha Clucka is a beast of a chicken sandwich and you can't go wrong with $1.25 sliders! Plus their shakes are simply divine, so don't be afraid to try one (totally recommend salted caramel).

Their happy hour specials included 1/2 price sliders and regular fries or tots as well as bogo draft beers !! My partner and I loaded up on the sliders I had one of each!  First was a mini corn dog that was not my favorite as the breading was a bit grainy , but inside was a plump and juicy frank, I hit that with a bit of mustard and it was out of this world , next was a mini bacon cheese dog , same juicy frank but this time served on a sweet toasted Hawaiian roll and a smattering of luscious cheese sauce and crisp bacon bits , yummy! Lastly was a mini burger on that same Hawaiian roll with a mini burger cooked to perfection with grilled onions and cheese !! This hands down was my favorite , I would definitively go back just for that alone !! I also enjoyed the cheesy tots , golden brown tots with that luscious cheese sauce on top , I would recommend though , if you go with the tots get them crisp if you add any toppings cuz they do have a tendency to fall apart when adding sauce or chili. from what I can tell their beer choices do change , but I had a pear cider which was great and an 805 lager , both were a great accompaniment to a stellar meal !",

I don't usually like hot dogs but this is my go to spot for hot dogs and burgers now. Go at happy hour when sliders are super cheap like $1.   They use toasted Hawaiian sweet roll as the bun for the burgers and hotdogs and they taste amazing. I can't tell you how much I enjoyed the hot dog beef and the hamburger meat it just tastes so good.   The milkshakes are awesome too I love the caramel milkshake and the prices are very reasonable.   To sum this up this is a great place to grab hot dogs and fries tots and milkshakes. I love the hamburger sliders as well.",

For the same price here you can get amazing dogs with all sorts of combinations and choices. The tatter tots are fine. Nothing extraordinary. However the seasoning on the fries are great! I couldn't get enough. The basic beef dog and the bacon wrapped dog are both delicious. They were even so nice and grilled the beef dog to a more well finish for one of us. The place looks cool and is clean. The staff are really friendly and look like they're having a good time. Coming again for sure.",

For about 10 dollars you can get a hotdog meal that is unique, filling and very tasty.  I would recommend trying it if you are apprehensive, you will be pleasantly surprised.",

I had the polish sausage, but they had many options of hot dogs, hamburgers, and sausages, and even a vegetarian option if that's your fancy.  The venue is nice for an after work outing as they have 3-6pm HH and a bunch of tvs and draft list of about 8 - pretty small total but it looked mostly local so I can get behind that.  The bun was the best part of my meal. My sausage came with added onions, peppers, jalapenos, and greens.  I thought the sides were just eh and didn't add much flavor.  In hindsight maybe I should have ordered one of their named plates rather than build your own to experience the sides in a better fashion.  Still, I enjoyed my meal and was full for the same price as any other fast casual lunch in town.  Took about 20 minutes from order to mouth and friendly staff all around.  If looking for a change of pace for lunch, Dog Haus is a good choice.",

    "text": "So I've made a lot of bad decisions in my life and not going to Dog Haus while I was a UNLV student and mere minutes away everyday certainly counts as one of them. I ended up at Dog Haus because one of my mates from London had a bit too much to drink the night before and wanted \"some dirty delicious American food\" this turned out to be one of the best decisions we made. Since it was first time we decided to order a few things and share. We got the little leaguer, hangover burger and the reservoir hog with regular and chili cheese tots. First off, they use quality bacon which is a must with me and their party is definitely fresh ANd well matched. I also am a giant fan of Hawaiian rolls and their sweetness totally pairs well with the savoriness of the meats and chilies.  I like their combinations of meats and veggies and stuff and that most of their sausages are wrapped in bacon because you can never have too much bacon.  They also serve alcohol and they had several delicious looking beers on tap but I wasn't able to park take. Neither was I able to put their margaritas to the test. I love that they advertise having alcohol instead of basically keeping it hidden like another restaurant *cough*Chipotle*cough*  hot dogs and margaritas and GOOD BACON= 5 stars from me anyday",

The atmosphere is really cool, (definitely better than the Johnny Rockets that was there before). They have alcohol and happy hour with beer and food on the menu. They're open late. And in central Vegas.   I got the slider dog and corn dog and some fries. Then slider dog had cheese and bacon (YUM). The chocolate shake was also to die for (drizzled with chocolate sauce). They have very friendly service and greet you upon entry and acknowledge you when you're leaving. I'm definitely going to come back to try the rest of their menu. It's worth coming to, trust me!  Oh, and FREE wifi!",

While my wife was doing her IT support for her company's sales training event I was able to do a little yelping to find a highly -recommended, close-by joint we could dine at during her lunch break. I texted her a link to the menu on DHB's website and she replied, \"YES! That looks sooo good!\" Needless to say our lunch was fabulous. I had the Mensch, she had the Little Mule and we shared an order of chili-cheese tots. Oh, sie sind so gut! We will be returning to DHB before our stay is over and I can't wait to try the Thai Fighter!  I wonder if they'll allow me to open a Dog Haus Biergarten in Kansas City??",

I loved everything about it except it was pretty not clean while I was there and it wasn't busy so that's the minus once star. Trash super full, tables not wiped down, etc. I feel like a jerk for snitching. Anyways..   Dog Haus serves hot dogs and sausages on Hawaiian sun buns. They have house ground sausages and they serve beer on tap. Totally cool place right off the strip and by UNLV.   I thought the food was great. The Hawaiian sun buns are totally a thing. Everything was just executed well. There's another hot dog establishment down the street that is more casual, but Dog Haus is the hot dog place on Paradise to beat. Staff was knowledgeable about upgrades and combos and the products.   I would definitely come back and even try one of their burgers.",

    "text": "Dog Haus is easily a 4-star wiener joint, which is saying something in Las Vegas land-of-the-taco, but today was mightily disappointing in the adult beverage department.   I asked to chase my Free Bird turkey sausage with the unique Hawaii-born coconut porter.  Denied.  How about the cider?  Rejected!  \"oh, I'm so sorry. Would you like to try...\" I notice not two, but FOUR beverages on tap are tapped out. Similar to the boozie overpriced and small shake had last time, disappointing. Water will have to do.  That sad exchange aside, the Polish kielbasa I had on my first visit was stellar. Real crunch to the outside, authentic seasoning on the inside, all lovingly held by an open Hawaiian bread which is grilled to perfection, bringing out the soft yet flavorful texture and taste of the oft-neglected bun.  And this time? My turkey 'dog was also aces---simple in execution, but the avocado and other fixings made it a filling spot. One burger slider to top it off, also a fine choice.   Dog Haus is, for the most part, priced fair. I love the display case so you can see the fresh fixings you are ordering. The bar-like scene is bright yet somehow hotdog-rustic at the same time. I'll be back, for sure, with hopes I can have the full experience advertised.",

I like the parking lot here as it is big. Our cashier was very nice. As we were deciding, we noticed the variety of hot dogs, sausage and veggie options in the case in front of us. Very nice. We decided on The Cowboy for me, as I love BBQ sauce, and the Old Town Dog for my husband with its jalapenos. We also got a side of tater tots.  I like that they have napkins at the table, so they are within reach and you use only what you need. They offer ranch and bbq sauce if you ask.   Everyone here was really friendly, and really seemed to enjoy their jobs. Once we got our food, they looked wonderful. The buns consist of 3 Hawaiian rolls together, but cut in half. The bbq sauce on mine was really flavorful. The sauce was nice and cold. However the hot dog itself was only warm, and barely even that. My husband's was the same way. The tater tots were nice and hot and crispy. We could not eat our entire meal, and ended up taking some home.   We love the interior here, the parking lot is spacious, they have Wi-Fi, and the 'dawgs' really look great. The combinations are great, and you can even request your own toppings. The disappointment though was that the hot dogs themselves were not even hot. Probably will not return.",

When I decide on what I wanted, I go to the front to order but was told that they're backed up and not taking any orders for 15 minutes. There was about 8 people total in the restaurant, with about half of them already with food. I thought it was weird that they'd be backed up but didn't argue. Went to my car to see if there was any other place that was open. A couple minutes later I see a couple walk in, take a look at the menu, and order/pay. I went back in to see if they're taking orders but was told by the same guy I talked to earlier, called himself Anthony, that I need to wait another 10 minutes. When I brought up the fact that I just saw someone else order, he just said he wasn't the one who took their order. I left in frustration after that. At that point there was about 4 people waiting on their order. If your restaurant gets backed up when there's 4 pending orders then you have a serious production line problem. And if you need to stop taking orders then tell that to the whole staff instead of selectively refusing.",

I have had burgers in just about ever joint that serves them and the Dog Haus in Vegas is bar none the Everest of burger joints. Taste gets a definite  10, service 10, Cleanliness of the restaurant way past 10. There was nothing I could find that would even get a -10.  Best burger in Vegas hands down.

We both agree the sweet roll for a bun just doesn't do it for us. There were two females inside screaming and yelling at each other and I'm not quite sure if they were just having a dialog or actually fighting. No one asked them to keep it down or kicked them out though.     So this last two week we tried 4 \"gourmet\" style hot dog joints and I have to admit they were all over priced. It's a hot dog, Nathan's hot dogs are about $.78 each add the $.50 bun, 6 oz of chili. Maybe they should take a trip down to Windy City and check their prices..",

We didn't feel like going to the strip or to a bar like we normally would to get something to eat at a late hour.  Now, we are actually not fans of hot dogs in general.  I looked up their menu online and saw burgers so we thought, \"Why not?\"  Upon arrival, we were feeling a little adventurous and ordered hot dogs anyway.  I had the Pig Lebowski and he ordered the Scott Baioli.  After his first bite, my husband said \"This is serious!\"  I felt the same way about my dog.  So good!  My dog came with the house slaw on it and I ordered more slaw on the side.  It was fresh and crisp and not soggy with too much mayo like other places might prepare it. We'll be going back for sure.",

Nice and friendly cashier and staff, atmosphere fits the name and food fare, but quality and price don't provide this place justice. I ordered the Scott baioli, a build your own dog with ketchup n tomatoes, a hangover burger and extra crispy fries...all for $25+ The fries were ok, nothing special. The Scott baioli was too much of something that was off putting..I ended up scraping all the extra condiments out and just eating the dog with the bread by itself. The hangover had chili, not bad, but didn't really need it..they use Hawaiian rolls for everything, dog buns, burger buns, etc. I like Hawaiian rolls, but it doesn't always fit with everything...this is one of those cases. If you must try this place, just go with a build your own..it's $2 cheaper. Get the tots over the fries..no need to mess with the burgers. Probably can venture into sausages though. Unfortunately, this will not be a return place for me. Glad to cross it off the list.",

Great flavor, plenty of food (yes, the tots are the tits), and surprisingly decent liquor and beer selection. My only reason for not leaving a 5th star is that the food is RIDICULOUSLY salty. I swole up like a woman in her 3rd trimester after binging potato chips. And that's saying something, because I'm a guy.

Other than the price, the food and taste were very good.  I'll blame Costco for ruining our understanding of what a large hot dog should cost.  Onto the food review (First trip): I ordered a Downtown Dog with Chili as my side.  You can tell immediately the dog itself is premium.  Juicy, flavorful, smoky grilled flavor.  Taste was great.  The bacon wrapping and use of Hawaiian roll definitely adds to the experience.  For me however, the star was the chili.  Hearty, meaty, spicy, and robust.  Very close to how I would make chili at home.  Next time I'm going to try the chili burger and chili covered tots.",

The flavor was really good, but I think my favorite part of the whole thing was it was layered on Hawaiian rolls which are known for being soft and sweet. I'm a huge burger lover, and this one lived up to my expectations. It was neither too big or too small. Even adding a side of fries (which my sister and I shared), I didn't feel overly stuffed. My total for everything was just over $8. We went during their happy hour, so a lot of their smaller plates were on the discounted menu (the fries), but he Freiburger was not. I'd been wanting to try it for some time, so there was no way I was going to pass it up.",

Try this place out if you're in the hood looking for an inexpensive lunch with a bar that doesn't have keno machines glaring back at you.",

Anyways,  wife got a burger and I got a veg dog with avocado and mayo which surprisingly tasted exactly like any actual beef hot dog you will find.  They have tons of other options and you can always customize it to your likings.  They use the Hawaiian sweet bun type for everything on a roll but amazing taste and a little expensive sure.  But for it,  the quality comes through.  Nice little central part of Vegas off the Strip across from HRH.",

I went with their corn dog because the root beer house made batter sounded intriguing. The all beef hot dog was so flavorful, the batter was pretty much obsolete.

I really wished I wouldve ordered a full sized burger and passed on the corn dog. The fries were crispy and well seasoned. I was suprised to see that they served beer on tap and mixed drinks.",

You have a few different meat choices + can create your own hotdog or burger if you don't want to try their recipes. It was soo tasty! They also serve alcohol.

We proceeded to order 2 different kinds of sausage dogs. The Fonz and Cocky Balboa. The meal was good, but the service was below standards. There was 6 groups of customers AFTER us that ordered, but somehow received All their food Before ours. I proceeded to the cashier and advised her that we still did Not our food and Everyone after us was already eating. They stated it was because our sausage meals take 7mins to cook. I believe they forgot our order because at this point it was past 20mins. There is no way the 1 cook can make 6 groups of orders and our order still not be done. The food is good, but it was an extremely disappointing experience. Being so close to the Las Vegas Strip you would assume they would have better service standards.",

    "text": "This is a place my hubby had bookmarked. I honestly didn't expect to like it here as much because I don't usually like hot dogs and burgers, but I ended up pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed my experience and it was a worthy of being bookmarked to check out. One thing they do here is serve the dogs and burgers on King's Hawaiian Rolls, so I was interested to see how that would turn out since I love making sandwiches on King's Hawaiian breads and rolls at home. The hot dogs are 100% all-beef skinless, burgers 100% natural Black Angus beef burgers and the sausages are handcrafted. On the menu you will find signature options or you can create your own with several options for toppings. Upon walking in we were given menus to look over and the girl who helped us answered any questions we had. The employees were courteous and knowledgeable of the menu which was nice since I was new to it. You can eat inside, outside or place your order to-go.   The Fonz ($7.99) - Spicy Italian sausage, pastrami and melted mozzarella served on 3 split King's Hawaiian Rolls. This one is tasty. Great flavors and I'd definitely order it again. Hubby really liked it as well and even thought about going back to order another one.   Sliders ($2.49 each) - With the sliders it's not just burgers. You can choose from a mini burger, mini hot dog or mini corndog. I chose the burger that was made with angus beef, caramelized onions, white American cheese,mayo and served in a one King's Hawaiian Roll. I hardly ever eat burgers and wished I had ordered a more of these delicious gems! Since they are mostly a 2-biter slider, I'd recommend coming during Happy Hour when they are half off.   Chili Cheese Fries ($5.99) - These fries were smothered in house-made cheese sauce, shredded cheese, chili and green onions. The fries I had were lightly crispy and hot however they didn't \"wow\" me. The cheese sauce really had a strong flavor that I personally didn't like at all and found it overpowered the taste of the chili. The chili had no beans and was thick with good flavor. Next time I'll ask for them to substitute the cheese sauce with shredded cheese.  Onion Rings ($3.99) - The rings are beer-battered and I liked them a lot. I prefer battered rings over the panko, breadcrumbs, etc. types and they did them just right here. Freshly made, tasty, crispy and something I'd more than likely choose as a side over the fries in the future. Don't forget to ask for some buttermilk ranch to dip or choose from one of their Haus Sauces for an extra $0.79 cents each.   They have regular shakes for $4.99 and they also have \"spiked\" shakes for $8.99 and soft serve ice cream. There is a bar inside and I recommend checking what the current HH specials are if you are coming down to drink and eat so you can save on both during that designated time.",

I've never had a burger on top of Hawaiian Sweet Rolls before but this is how they serve their burgers! Being from Hawaii I love sweet rolls so I thought this was a pretty good idea and it was tasty! They do have vegetarian dogs and burgers which I appreciated and the food is not very pricey. I wished the fries were a bit thicker but if you like thin fries you'll get them here. They have all kinds of burger and hot dog items and it's a cool ambience and easy to find parking (which is free). I would come again!",

The burger comes with a super yolky fried egg, cojita cheese, American cheese, an aioli, and jalapenos,  BUT They let you make substitutions for items in the same price range. Since I don't love American cheese but do love onions, I asked for crispy onions instead, made it a combo and, even though I showed up famished, I still had leftover fries.   My dining companion went with the old town dog, a favorite of hers that comes wrapped in bacon with jalapenos, cojita, aioli, and caramelized onions, and cheesy fries. Haven't tried the old town but it sounds right up my alley. The cheese on the cheesy fries are more like a queso dip style cheese. Good cheese, I just prefer the plain.",

    "text": "Really quick, a little about me: I'm a budding vegan. In spirit. Overall, I'm a natural born foodie. I have a hard time quitting meat or eggs or honey because I'm not doing it for the animals, I'm doing it for my own eating habits. I like fruits and vegetables and I hate how much we pay for meat, when we can get the same nutrition from plants. And like anyone else, I get cravings!! But I'm a beautiful work in progress and I believe food should be fun!  * Onwards now.     I went to the Dog Haus before work one night. I work in the plaza and I've seen and heard nothing but great things about this place but I've never been. It's like 300 feet from my job so what the hell, time for something new.  Before I even walked inside I was digging the setup. The windows, how you can see inside the restaurant. It's...attention grabbing.  Even outside one of their signs is flashing and I think it should stay that way. It's cool. I walk inside and it's not the busiest place, which is great because that signifies quick service and not a long wait time.  Today with trying something new, I have been cheating on my \"go meatless\" diet the past couple days and I needed to cleanse my soul of cheating with something completely meatless. And I'm glad I chose Dog Haus. The cashier was super nice and she walked me through the options on the menu that could be substituted with a veggie patty. She was super into her job, in the sense that she knew what she was doing; super helpful.       I ordered the Lil Mule without the fried egg and substituted the normal beef patty with a veggie patty and I really didn't know what I was getting myself into but I should've ordered two of those bad boys!  I have a picky palette and I have yet to find a restaurant that can REALLY make a veggie patty. It's more than just a \"patty\" we want it to taste charbroiled too! Not like a salad.  And that's what I got, the absolute package. There was a menagerie of different flavors in my mouth at one time that were so good, you didn't miss the meat or the fried egg. Oh let's talk about the bun real quick please, HAWAIIAN ROLLS? I've never liked Hawaiian Rolls but wow. Wow wow wow. My taste buds never felt more welcomed, more home. It was so good, I almost offered some coworkers a bite...Almost. It was too good to share. And you know what? The price isn't bad either. It's not just your average burger/hot dog joint.       I reviewed this place five stars because I got wonderful service. My food was hot and fresh, the visual presentation of my burger was appealing, and that patty....my heart is on fire.  I am definitely going back and I'm even recommending this place to everyone I know! That doesn't really happen often because not everyone has my same palette, but looking at the menu, there's no doubt that there is something for everyone.  Especially me, the \"undecided vegan\" foodie.  HAWAIIAN ROLLS!!",

Happy hour runs from 3-6pm and there's a reverse late night happy hour as well. That means $1.25 sliders, fries, and tots plus $2 off beers on tap. Decent variety of beers on tap but nothing out of the ordinary. Still, with sliders this tasty, you'll find something cold to wash them down. The burger patties are juicy and well seasoned and work so well with the sweet Hawaiian rolls they're served in. So addictive that you can go though a whole lot of them in no time!   Very friendly staff serve a mostly local clientele. If you're in the neighborhood, Dog Haus is a great spot to satisfy a burger craving.",

Everything was really good, the sausage had great flavors, the BBQ sauce and slaw that came on top of the sausage were a great combination. The place is spacious, officers alcoholic beverages, nice and clean.   It is a better deal to pick from one of the options the already created, making your own dog will most likely cost way more since each topping costs anywhere from .70-1.50$.   The only small hiccup was that they weren't quite ready when they opened, there wasn't ice in the soda machine and the bathroom did have papers. But it was not a big deal at all!   Overall, great flavors and reasonably priced!!",

The menu boasts eight interesting sausage combos, plenty of dogs, sliders, burgers, chicken sammies and draught brews. I was eyeing Das Brat (bratwurst, caramelized onions, sauerkraut, spicy brown mustard) bc I'm a bit of a purist, but instead went with some happy hour specials (half off sliders, tots, drink specials) bc I'm also a cheapist. With the special (3-6pm, 10pm-4am), two cheeseburger sliders, two dog sliders (with cheese and bacon), tots and a drink ran just over $8. This was a lot of food for one man, though I was up fat, I mean, for, the task and ended up enjoying all of it. The tots were super crispy, the burgers cheesy and juicy, and those lil dawgs were thick and perfect with a little mustard on top of that cheese (yes, I am gross). Would love for this Haus to be closer to my local watering hole here in NY!",

They have so many delicious options to add to your hotdog it's almost overwhelming.. in a good way! Definitely a must try! You wont regret it.. it delicious:)",

I am not a huge fan of hot dogs but, every now and then I get a taste for them.  This place is the ultimate hot dog lovers stop with a huge selection of dogs, burgers, sliders, sausage and desserts.  It is counter service with a couple of tables out front in case you have your puppy with you like I did.  This location has parking in the strip mall parking lot and was an easy drive off of the strip on our way to the park.  The pricing was decent and the portion sizes are big so think about sharing that side of chili cheese tater tots!",

From 3-6pm M-F and all day Sunday and even a late night happy hour from 11p-close (2am) theres so many opportunities to come in here and experience this simple yet delicious food. Their sliders are $1.25 and the sides (fries & tots) are 2 bucks off which basically makes them 99 cents. I work on the strip so the fact that I can call a few minutes before I get off and order three sliders and some tots for 5 bucks is the absolute best. They are fast and efficient. All the sliders are served in Hawaiian rolls (obviously) and you have an option of corn dogs, hot dog slider, or a burger slider. Each one made fresh and piping hot by the time I get there. The staff is helpful. The establishment is clean. Parking usually sucks because they are so many businesses in the lot but for the most part I give this place 5/5!",

Doesn't compare to Hollywood/LA street meat.  But back to the burger review... Decent burger. I liked the fact that it was on sweet Hawaiian rolls flavor-wise, but because it was 4 of them, it fell apart too easily. The slaw was a bit much, but at least the bacon was crunchy.   Messy burger. Make sure you have a lot of napkins on hand.  Will probably go with sliders next time.   More reviews on foodingwithbobo - instagram",

It's a perfect combination of sweet and savory so you can't go wrong with any of their hotdogs.   I recently tried the Bad MothaClucka, and it was a huge, badass mothaclucka! The chicken was so crispy on the oustide, and so thick and juicy on the inside. It reminded me of the old Burger King chicken sandwich but like 10x better. Their sides- fries, chili cheese fries, tater tots, and onion rings, are all really good as well.   I also love how they have seasonal specials. I tried the Loco Moco a couple of months ago for Hawaiian Food week, and it was freakin loco! It had a soy sauce and sriracha glazed meat patty, polish sausage, and a sunny side up egg, topped with gravy, fried onions, scallions, and togarashi. It was an explosion of flavors but also a bit overwhelming.   Overall, just a great place to watch a game, socialize, have a beer, and grab a wiener.",

Sooo Veggie is their signature veggie dog option, and while you can substitute it in any other menu item, you should definitely give it a try. Similar to their Sooo Cali but replaced with a flavorful, sweet, smoky apple veggie sausage, it's topped with deliciously crispy shoestring onions with arugula, avocado, and tomato for freshness. It's also topped with a basil aioli that lends an herby component with a liiil' kick. It's <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>, and to make it better, they stuff it in a sweet, buttery Hawaiian roll.   I would definitely stick to their hot dog in a bun options. Their hot dogs on a stick are okay, but I don't think they're much better than the ones served up at a mall fast food chain.   As for their sides, they are massive. And while they're by no means the star of the show, they play a decent support role to round out the meal. One hot dog and one side to share is the perfect portion to leave me feeling satisfied and then some.",

I think it's hilarious the girl who posted a bad review because it wasn't vegan/gluten free.  It's a hot dog/sausage/burger place!",

Both were a little messy but sooooooooo amazing. The ONIB was kind of spicy for me but still really tasty. The cheese tots are very good. Very cheesy. Overall we are def going back to try new things very soon.",

    "text": "Clean resteraunt and friendly employees. We are off to a good start!   The cashier asked me how I was doing then came around the counter to show me the hot dogs available and a few of the menu options.   I order the Scott Bailoi, which was described as grilled onions, cheese, garlic ailoi and bacon crumbles. I also opted for the cheesy tots.   They gave me a number on a stick to place on my table so I went to wash up, grab a drink and check some emails. After cleaning up my inbox I looked up wondering when they were going to bring the food out and noticed a lonely tray of food sitting up on the counter. I walked up and asked if it was mine and got \"yea, sorry\" as he continued to wipe down the counter.   Whatever, let's give it a try.. very small dog wraped in a huge bun with a ton of cheese, oily diced onions, hard bacon crumbles and mayonaise.   This spot would be the bomb if I was in college and drunk. SADLY, I am neither. I am a middle aged, blue collar guy looking for a quick lunch at a good value. (Hot dog, right??)  $12.00 bucks for a poor hot dog, pre-frozen tots with cheese sauce poured over them and drink is not my idea of a reasonable lunch which is why I can only assume they were dead slow at 12:30 on Wednesday.  Keep in mind, $12 bucks was after the \"locals discount\" I was told I was receiving and before the tip.",

Their food on the other hand was great!! The freiburger was by far my favorite, it's served on a sweet roll with American cheese, mayo, fried egg, slaw and fries. Soo good. (7.99)  The fonz was good, but I personally wouldn't get it again. It was on the salty side. Italian spicy sausage with pastrami and mozzarella. (7.99)  My daughter got the corn dog kids meal it was pretty big with fries and 2 \"sliders\"  We also got the caramel \"spiked\" milkshake. Which was better than I expected! It was a good mix of alcohol and Milkshake.",

    "text": "All right if you haven't been to Dog Haus and you like hotdogs well then you're missing out. They are located all over Southern California. They also have locations in Yuma Arizona,  Colorado, Las Vegas Nevada, Texas, Tennessee and Utah. My personal favorite hotdog to order is the Sooo Cali it's made with wild arugula, crispy onions, spicy basil aioli, avocado, and tomato absolutely delicious. I also would recommend you try the corn dog which is like the high end corn dog at Disneyland in Anaheim with the thick corn bread covering and well done, not the sad soggy limp corn dog they sell throughout the rest of the park, I think Disney sells both just to confuse people. Anyway back to Dog Haus they also have Hamburgers, Milkshakes, Chocolate Chip Cookies and  Coctails for those of you that want to add a little something to your Dog Haus experience. A huge bonus is that they are open until 4:00AM here in Las Vegas  they are literally right across the street from the Hard Rock hotel casino on Paradise Rd. Personally I think they should get really creative and add a few more hotdogs to the menu to really set it off I guess we'll have to wait and see. Anyway get in there try them out",

I was thirsty so I started with a Moscow mule, it was perfectly mixed and not too tart.  Heads up, their happy hour starts at 10pm - 1/2 off apps and (I think) $2 off drafts.  Anyway, I went with the Reservoir Hog with a Love Boat on the side.  Both were fantastic - the chili here has just enough cumin to amp up the flavor without overpowering everything like some places, and it pairs nicely with their slaw.  The portions were well sized, but I was starving, so afterwards I went with the Sooo California, which was absolutely amazing.  Something about the way the pesto blends with the arugula and the sweetness of the Kings Hawaiian Bread roll is just bonkers.  Definitely one of the best dogs I've ever had.  Anyway, thumbs way up, I'll be back for sure!",

I had the Cowboy with onion rings and barbecue sauce. My wife had a regular burger with tater tots. They use King Hawiian buns that are toasted and sweet which makes the burgers that much better. We went on a Sunday which had a happy hour in which drafts were 2 bucks off and other drinks were 50 percent.  The craft beers were good and they had hard liquor as well. We went back the day after and it was still one of the best burgers I've had. Will definitely be going back when we return to Vegas.",

Which is interesting because every part of the ordering process is fast food. You walk up to the counter order your meal they ask you for here or to go and they give you a number. They do bring you your food or call out for to go orders. Also like fast food you go to a soda machine. Everything is served in disposable paper products on an aluminum tray.   The decor is industrial. All the seating is bolted to the ground. Stools and benches are your seating options. Nothing with you sit back and relax in. The counter people were nice.   I spent $13 on a combo. I ordered the little leaguer with cheese fries and a soda. The beef hot dog was greasy I should have requested turkey dog. The chili was bland and you really couldn't fast the difference in a regular bun vs kings Hawaiian rolls. The cheese fries were good I'd get them again. Basically out of the combo that is all I would get. So the review went from a 1 star to a 2 star that's just because of the fries.",

I had the Das Brat, a Polish sausage with sauerkraut and spicy mustard, and battered onion rings. Just to round out the fatness of it all, we completed our combos with shakes, mine a dutch chocolate, and hers a vanilla. They were good, kinda tasted like Wendy's frosties.

There's some good,basic craft beers and an accommodating set of spirits if you're up for a drink with your gourmet dog. The buns .. Hawaiian Sweet Bread = delicious. Toasted nicely and just a really nice layer of flavor in the mix.   I'll definitely be back! Thanks to a vey cool and helpful staff.. Oh and the house Bloody Mary's are also worth a try! Slightly sweet but savory and finished with bacon.   Happy Eating !",

    "text": "Juicy hot dogs, hot employees? What more could a college student want?!  For about three weeks, I watched Dog Haus get comfortable in the plaza where they decided to make their mark and drooled every time. I kept picturing what their food may be like in my head. Finally, yesterday, I decided to feed my inner beast.  Dog Haus is loud and rocking. The stainless steel interior and muted wood wainscoting makes you feel like you're walking into a rough and tumble junk yard. You're waiting for the dogs to come at you and they do, in all the sweetness a King Hawaiian roll can offer you.  Even accommodating the Vegan taste buds, Dog Haus has a relatively wide range of sausages, dogs and burgers for you to try. My German roots couldn't ignore the Pig Lebowski: Polish sausage, coleslaw, BBQ sauce and French fries. You're welcome to make your meal a combo which includes fries or tots and a drink. If you're a conossuier of chili cheeseness, they do have the option of adding those to your spuds. Try The Love Boat! That comes topped with ooey-gooey awesomeness with a mound of their sweet slaw finishing it off. My choice of entree was delicious, magnanimously flavorful with just the right about of spice. It helped that they were playing David Bowie on the radio.  If you're looking for a hangover cure or a cool joint to hang out at, Dog Haus is the place to go. With a little bar tucked away in the corner, you're able to choose from typical drafts to the daily special. Also, if you're a local, mention it to them in conversation and they may surprise you with a 10% discount.",

    "text": "I had some preconceived notions walking in. This isn't the first place to make fancy hotdogs and it won't be the last. I picked the Sooo Cali because it sounded good to me, not too heavy. (Note, this is far from diet food and if you are on a diet don't even walk in the door.) I would have ordered a combo with a shake but their machine was down and decided on a New Belgium Citradelic instead with a side of tots to share w a friend.   The dog was a little awkward to pick up because Dog Haus doesn't use hotdog buns which over the years have been conditioned to fit hotdogs perfectly, they use three unseparated King's Hawaiian Rolls which have been toasted on the grill with a little butter. This bun base perches the dog a little high and then you have the array of toppings sitting on top of the dog. In this case we had wild arugula, tomato, crispy onions, spicy basil aioli, and avocado. The mix of flavors and textures is worth the mess you are about to create and lean forward to not drop any escaping crispy onions from hitting your pants.  The tots were good, despite the light color they were freshly fried nice and crisp. You can find plenty of napkins on the tables.   This isn't an every week kind of place but definitely great enough to make me want to try a sausage or burger next time. Hopefully their ice cream machine will be working for a dark chocolate shake.",

I ordered a build your own chicken sausage with lettuce, tomatoes, & spicy basil aioli. The aioli wasn't spicy at all but it was really good. The buns they use are Hawaiian rolls.... light and fluffy with a hint of sweetness. A little messy to eat but worth it. My husband ordered the old town dog which was a hot dog wrapped in bacon topped with jalapenos, onion, chipotle aioli, & cotija cheese. He loved it. We split an order of tots. Pretty basic, nothing special. Really didn't need them because the hot dogs are filling enough. Overall nice place to stop for a quick bite.",

Ordered 3 burger sliders and 2 hot dog sliders with some tater tots. Delicious as always, my only reason behind my rating was my girlfriends input on how she preferred Pasadena over this location.   Regardless, this place is a must! Great job as always Dog Haus, we shall see you soon!",

My hot dog entree was missing from the order. When I called Dog Haus to discuss it, I was directed to \"call GrubHub,\" which to me is already completely inappropriate as GrubHub was not the party causing the issue, nor was I the one that made any mistake with the order. So disappointed with the poor customer service at Dog Haus. This was already during my timed lunch at work.   I called GrubHub anyway and they couldn't send a driver to pick up the hot dog because the cost of the hot dog alone would not meet the $20 minimum. Even so, GrubHub offered to refund my money for the hot dog and a 50% off coupon to me for my next order with them. I didn't want to spend more than I originally planned to fix this, so I took them up on their offer, but this wasn't even GrubHub's problem to fix.   It felt like the responsibility of solving this problem was put on me, the customer, and it wasn't worth it anymore. I will not be supporting this business any longer. There are too many other better quality and nicer businesses close by to be wasting my time here.",

All the dog and burger varieties have been excellent..  a bit over the top with toppings, sauces etc... but the quality of ingredients is very good for a fast casual joint like this.  All the food items are served on Hawaiian rolls, so definitely heavy.  Tots, fries and rings are all phenomenal, but I really like the crispness of the fries.... perfect crunch.",

    "text": "Dining at Dog Haus Biergarten is now my go to place for delicious hot dogs. I love how they provide friendly service. When I called and inquired about their menu, the person I spoke to is very pleasant and said they can substitute the hot dog with a vegetarian version. I arrived at the restaurant right after happy hour and there was plenty of available seating. Near the front entrance, they have a menu where you can scan through the items and when you're ready to order, you walk to the counter, pick what you like, and then pay. They give you a number and bring the food to you.   I tried their most popular items: Sooo Cali, The Love Boat, and Onion Rings. Mine is more of a custom order. I had the Sooo Cali with a vegan Haus Dog, which has yucca potatoes, smoked apple, sage, and spices. The Sooo Cali ($6.99) comes with avocado, tomato, wild arugula, and crispy fried onions. I even asked for some jalapenos ($0.99) and they slather the vegan Haus Dog with that amazing spicy basil aioli that's all served on three toasted Hawaiian Rolls. Seriously, it taste so fingerlicking good! Everything in the Sooo Cali plus the jalapenos is flavorful and worth the price. Though I have to be honest, it is kind of messy. My first attempt eating it and some of that delicious sauce fell off. Thankfully, they have plenty of napkins on the table, but I end up reaching for a fork and knife to finish it. I'm not sure if the Hawaiian Rolls are meant to firmly hold the hot dog. Maybe the rolls just need a little more time to toast.   When ordering The Love Boat ($4.99), it can be customize to your liking. You can choose fries or tater tots. Preferably, I like eating fries but I ordered tater tots and asked if they can make it extra crispy. It's usually topped with a Haus chili and Haus slaw. It is quite nice how they are accommodating to certain request, because my order came with tater tots and extra slaw ($0.79). They serve it as a generous portion. The tater tots are extra crispy. However, the Haus slaw taste just okay, it was a bit lacking in flavor. Maybe if they add some of that spicy basil aioli, it will make the slaw taste better. Now the Onion Rings ($3.99) are my favorite. It's light, airy, crispy, and not at all greasy. It's something I can snack on without feeling regret. I'm going to order extra onion rings on my next visit, because they make it so good and it's a perfect complement to the meal.   As for beverage, they serve alcohol drinks and they have milkshakes. The utensils, ketchup, and mustard are next to the soda fountain. I really like the atmosphere here. It's very chill and laid back. You can enjoy your meal while listening to classic songs played from the 80's, 90's, and legendary hits like Free Fallin', Janie's Got A Gun, Beat It, and Ghostbusters. Overall, it's a great place to be for tasty hot dogs, they have burgers too, they make handcraft drinks, play awesome music, and I'm loving it!",

    "text": "Dog Haus has been bookmarked on my Yelp for who knows how long. I was on a recent stay-cation with some friends that came into town to celebrate the New Year and we stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino which just happens to be right across the street. I personally am not really a fan of much of the food options that the Hard Rock has to offer so my friends and I ventured out while staying there and I saw the sign for Dog Haus and just had to stop by to finally see what the hype was about.  When we arrived it was on a Friday night so I was expecting there to be a bit of a wait which it was but nothing too major. After previewing the menu prior to arriving I was already sold on the \"Old Town\" haus dog which consisted of  smoked bacon wrapped dog, caramelized onions, chipotle aioli, pickled jalapenos, cotija cheese and a side of chili cheese fries. After I ordered they gave me a number to bring with me back to the table.   Cool thing about this place is they have a bar you can utilize while you wait! They offer both dine in and take out orders so having a drink in the meantime always is a good idea! I noticed while I was waiting the sign that advertised a happy hour which is another plus! Mon-Fri 3PM-6PM...\"Late Night\" 10PM-4AM and \"Sunday Funday\" 11AM-4AM. I'll have to be back to see how they are during one of those time frames.   My overall thought of the haus dog was that it was okay. I think that the concept that they have here with serving the hotdogs on Hawaiian bread rolls is different and can set them apart from any other hot dog place but I just didn't get that WOW omg factor from it. I know they offer like an upgrade or something you can do so maybe next time i will do that to get the taste out of the basic category. Same thing with the chili fries they were just meh for $5.99. I think I might just have to try a different type of haus dog or even one of the haus sausages or even one of the burgers.",

We decided to order several more items on the menu to try because everything sounded so good. He ordered the hot dog special of the month (I can't recall the name), I ordered the Free Bird, then we split a burger slider, the chicken sandwich, the tots with chili and a mini corn dog. The corn dog was just ok, I couldn't taste any of the root beer in the batter. We both liked the chili for the tots more than expected. We were both fans of the burger slider. My boyfriend is a chicken sandwich snob and wasn't a huge fan, but I absolutely loved it and couldn't get enough - and I'm normally not a fan of fried food on a sandwich in general. The sandwich was so flavorful and moist - I finished it all even though I was stuffed. My hot dog was even better than last time - the miso ranch combined with the avocado was just to die for. What can I say, this is the best hot dog place ever and we'll be back every time we're in Vegas!",

Dog Haus is a home run, there's nothing on the menu that doesn't scream \"OMG!\" or \"That Looks So Good!\" They serve the dogs and burgers on Hawaiian Rolls, which makes it hearty.  Sooo Cali Arugula, Spicy Aioli, Onions, Avocado and Tomato This hot dog blew me away and I can understand why. The frank was juicy, not mushy and was firm when I bit into it. Zestfulness from the toppings and crunch from the onions. The bread was soft and held the dog nicely like in a pillow.   Simply unbelievable you have to try it!!  The Freiburger White american cheese, Fried Egg, Slaw, Fries and Mayo. This burger is an absolute monstrosity, and I'm not talking about the size. This is one of those rare times I took a pause while I was eating and subconsciously prayed to hamburger gods, told them thank you.         The service was fast and friendly. The staff was nice and helpful answering questions that I had.   Dog Haus has great balance between a sports bar and a fast casual restaurant!! This is a great joint I'll definitely be going back there.",

My fiancee and I shared the bailoni dog and the little mule burger and savored then to the very last bite.   Also notable, on Sunday's they have happy hour 11am - 4am! I would skip the soft serve (it's too soft) next time but will definitely try the adult milkshake in the future. Enjoy!",

We left and when we arrived at our destination, there was only one hot dog.  I bit in into the fries and they were partially frozen and greasy.    I called the store, and the cashier admitted to forgetting the other part of the order.  When speaking to the manager, Elizabeth Hernandez, the first thing she said was, \"You forget your order?\"  Clearly, the staff lied to her or she did not want to admit it.  I told her about the frozen fries and she did nothing about it.  She said, \"I give you one meal.\"  After giving uas the run arohnd she refused to make it right. I was one of the first 20 people in this location, in only 1 month this place has way down hill.  After taking a bite of the hot dog, the end has freezer burn.  Avoid this place at all costs.    Another note, the taps weren't working for beer!",

I'm not much of a hot dog person, but coming here to see the great quality of their food really sold me. The cooks here really care about presentation and precision with making the orders. I had a very complicated long order with my group of friends and every single one of our orders was made to perfection. My friends all enjoyed the Bangkok Dog with fried egg. They said it was different but very tasty. I had their burger sliders and omg are they amazing, they literally just melt in your mouth! Their cheese tots are the bomb too! If you haven't tried the place, I highly recommend you do! Oh, and there's also a bar with lots of tasty drinks:P  My only complaint is that I think it's a little pricy, but not too much that it hurts my wallet.  ***Update: The Holy Aioli is literally heaven in my mouth. Cheese tots are a great pairing for it.",

    "text": "Thank you Yelp for helping me find Dog Haus.   First off, the dogs themselves are great. Cooked to perfection with the right amount of snap and spiced just right.   Oh the use of grilled Hawaiian rolls is fantastic. Not sure the rolls are actually King's Hawaiian rolls, (hope they are). They're reminiscent of the type of bread used in lobster roll. Good and different choice.   First time here, we ran through the following:  Cowboy dog-grilled bun, dog with American cheese, BBQ sauce and crispy onions. Sweet and sticky. A little too sweet for me. Would have preferred a tangier sauce.  Crispy onions are a nice topper.   Little leaguer-good 'ol chili dog with cheese and onions. Solid. This will be put in the rotation.   Turkey dog-my kids ate the whole thing so I give it a third party thumbs up.   Fires and onion rings-cooked correctly. Nice normal fries. The rings were bite through. Which means the onion didn't pull out of the batter on that first bite.   Chocolate shakes-very good. Not overly sweet. Solid.   Ambience-clean, nice, industrial, cool and hip. Good friendly service.   This dog rules the Haus.",

So glad our buddy Nate suggested this place, it really did hit the spot. The place looked clean and brand new with its industrial look. I was surprised by all the options to pick from, no just hot dogs but sausages , burgers and more on the menu.   I took down the \"Sooo Cali\" dog... I know how typical of me being from SoCal and all. The hot dog with avocado and tomatoes was rad enough but what really nailed it was the bun.  The bun was not your typical old bun but a tasty Hawaiian roll.... bun.  Tried some of Nate's cheesy tots and sort of wished I had ordered some too. Washed it all down with a cold beer and we were off into the night.",

It seemed to be a great turnout with a consistent line of approximately 20-30 people the whole time I was there. For a first day, everything was so smooth and we had a wonderful experience. The cashiers were proficient, we received our food quickly considering how busy they were, and someone checked in with us multiple times.  King's Hawaiian Rolls! Everything is on grilled King's Hawaiian Rolls! Dogs and sausages get three in a row and burgers get a square of four rolls. Who doesn't love these rolls?! It's brilliant!  Haus Dogs are made with special all-beef skinless dogs. There are veggie dogs available upon request. $6.99/each.  Sooo Cali: Wild arugula, avocado, tomato, crispy onions, and spicy basil aioli. The hot dog itself is delicious; great flavor and bite. The toppings worked well together and I loved the little kick of spice from the aioli.  Old Town Dog: Smoked bacon-wrapped dog, caramelized onions, roasted jalapeno, chipotle aioli, and cotija. This was the most flavorful and tasty dog/sausage of the bunch. However, it was rather spicy! I would need to go light on the jalapeno and/or aioli.  Haus Sausages are made with hand-crafted sausages. Veggie Italian Sausage and Veggie Smoked Apple Sausage available upon request. $7.99/each.  The Hot Chick: Chicken fontina sausage (chicken, fontina, basil, arugula, and red chiles; smoked), avocado, tomato, crispy onion, Sriracha, and ranch. The sausage is delicious and everything, of course, was delicious. I could've done without the Sriracha though.  The Fonz: Spicy Italian sausage (pork, basil, fennel, and chiles), pastrami, and melted mozzarella. Really great Italian sausage and again, delicious combination.  Fries ($2.99): Their fries are the skin-on handcut type and decent.  Tater Tots ($2.99): Same ol' tots we all know and love.   This is a neat spot with delicious gourmet dogs and sausages at decent prices. I'm definitely heading back since there are so many other signature dogs and sausages I want to try, including their adorable slider dogs!",

Omg I love tots and the cheese is not perfect,  but not everything van make it to being perfect. Right?  I still ate ALL of it and it was the second time I ordered them. The ranch too I'm very picky about cause I dont want store bought ranch where ever I go. So if your Texan and like your ranch, you'll love theirs.   Again I am a uber Lyft driver so I'm alwasy finding places to send people. I have to all my family and friends to go here. So I hope I'm helping bring you good business!

So technically the sausage and Impossible patties are plant based, but I think they cook them on the same grill with the meat. So at the end of the day depending on what kind of moral compass you go by. Whether you're Vegan or Vegetarian you might be able to enjoy it.

    "text": "One of the few places that serves up a good variety of sausage sandwiches. I like that they offer chicken options, its hard to find a good chicken sausage. We ordered the Cocky Balboa and sweet potato fries. Both were very good. Sausage was delicious very juicy, flavorful, and tasted gourmet. Good quality meats were used to make this sausage. The only thing that would make this a better sandwich for the price would be a little more meat and less bread. The roll was thick and we felt like the bread took away from the headliner of the sandwich, which is the sausage. Overall it was very good and makes a perfect late night meal. If the price was a little better then it would have been a solid 5 stars for me but its not a bad deal considering they're open really late on weekends and actually have some good beers to offer also. After a certain price point for a sandwich that size you're mostly paying for overhead.",

It's a hot dog place but it's also a bar. It has a happy hour. Well drinks are only $2, so it's some of the cheapest drinks in all of Vegas. It has a fairly simple menu. There aren't too many choices, just enough to have some variety. I like the Beyond Brat. It's about $9 and comes with spicy mustard and sauerkraut. The brat is made from Beyond sausage.   I've been to many of these kind of hot dog places, and a lot have the funky atmosphere, but the food isn't good enough. It actually has some good dogs, and cocktails. They have some good sandwiches too.",

    "text": "After an epic 6 hours outside in the hot dessert, I needed some cold drinks and greasy food and this place did not disappoint!  We came during happy hour and was able to snag a few good deals which include a bacon wrapped sausage and a beer. We also got the little mule burger and the love boat tots.  Bacon wrapped sausage: very tasty, amazed that they were able to keep the bacon wrapped with the sausage, but flavor was just ok. We chose the spicy basil sauce and that was very good though.  Little mule burger: I like the fact that the buns are 4 Hawaiian rolls so it was easy to split the burger. It wasn't the best burger I had bit it was pretty good. The egg was cooked perfectly and somehow, the sweetness of the roll went really well with everything. I also like that the jalapeno had a small little kick. I did wish the the roll was a little toasted because the softness made the burger very unstable.  Love boat tots: the tots was cooked perfectly! I also love the chili and Cole slaw that went on it, but I can eat each of those component separately and called it good. The combo didn't work well together though.  Our friends got the happy hour burger, the impossible burger and the fries and they all love their food as well. The fries were exceptionally cooked.  Overall it was a really really good place to eat considering the price and portion and quality of the food. Definitely a hangout spot or a place to bring friends to for a nice chat",

Whenever I have visitors from out of town, this is one of the places I take them. With that being said, on Thursday 9/19, I treated my coworkers to lunch. I was talking about how great the food is and decided I'd let everyone experience it as well. I ordered 6 Sooo Cali dogs, 1 cheeseburger and 4 Impossible sliders. Everything was up to the usual standards except for the sliders. They looked HORRIBLE!!! They are GROSSLY misrepresented in the photos on the website and looked like frozen White Castle burgers. I was embarrassed to even give them to my coworkers. And so TINY, I could not believe they cost $4.99 each! IT WAS A JOKE!!! I wish I had taken pictures for this review. What a waste of money. NEVER AGAIN!!!",

In fact, I left my smoky wait for my room in the Hard Rock to get lunch and was glad to see the fried and True Dog Haus.   Had my fav Reservoir Hog and substituted a turkey dog. (Does Quentin Tarantino get royalties from this?) Added cheese tots and my Vegas visit was off to a healthy beginning ... not.   Anyway if I had a complaint, the meal took 25 minutes and they weren't busy. Must have hit them at the wrong minute because the fine folks behind me got their dogs and potatoes faster. Que sera. What takes long in Vegas, takes long in Vegas.   Can't go wrong here with the food and they have alcohol. Bon appetit.",

    "text": "I never have left a bad review for anyone because honestly I think it's pathetic and not worth my time and I'd rather not be spreading negativity. Unfortunately my experience at Dog Haus was more than terrifying. If you have a food allergy I advise you stay far away. I am allergic to shellfish, I usually pick restaurants that don't have shellfish on the menu because it's easier for me rather than having to ask a million questions and sometimes get told that a restaurant won't be able to make my food safely. If you are allergic to food cross contamination is very serious, so shrimp being cooked on the same grill as my burger, I would have an allergic reaction. If a salad being made in the same bowl that was used to make a shrimp salad, I would have an allergic reaction. So before I order I asked the cashier, if there was shellfish on the menu because I don't see it but I am allergic to it so I have to make sure. She responds \"no everything is fine you don't have to worry about that at all no fish or anything is cooked on our grills\". That being said I was under the impression she understood food allergies fairly well. We wait for our food, a half hour goes by, a couple that came in after us got their food before us. I'm cool with all of this. Then one of their employees comes in with bags of food from Kaizen Sushi which is next store to them, and all the employees clocked in at this time (beside one of the men who were cooking) started eating this sushi with their gloves on. That is just disgusting. Eating with your gloves on that you are making people's food with is a major health code violation. Eating in the same place the food is cooked is a major health code violation. They were not using forks they were eating with their hands the same way you'd eat chips. Touching their mouth. I got up and said hi excuse me, one woman chef made a hand gesture at me and went back to eating. Then the woman who was my cashier said \"yes\" and I said I would like a refund, you are eating sushi and I am allergic to shellfish. She says \"no you'll be fine I'm eating and they are the ones cooking your food\" while pointing to the woman who I just saw eat some weird shrimp thing, I informed her that I saw that other woman eating as well and I need a refund because I am not safe eating here she got an attitude with me and goes \"ok fine\" I ask my boyfriend to handle the refund process because I can't touch anything from this cashier because once again I can have an allergic reaction. This process took way too long, probably 30 minutes or more. And she tried to tell my boyfriend he wasn't getting a refund on our drinks, and argued with him. If she was even apologetic of her actions and made the refund process pleasant I wouldn't be so upset, but I still had to write the review because 1. Eating food behind the counter with your gloves on and proceeding to cook with those same gloves is disgusting and 2. I want other people with food allergies to be aware that this place can be very very dangerous for you. Last but not least I understand hiring must be very difficult for any company but keeping employees that severely violate health codes is beyond my imagination, if they call out and don't show up to work cool, but health code is made to keep the consumer safe. If any of those women had a cold or the flu, or worse any customer is at risk of being sick. Now their saliva is all over the place. The cashier seemed to be a manager, so if she's a manager why should the employees below her think anything their doing is wrong. The manager is setting a bad example. Which leads me to believe the manager above her is setting a bad example. Take Disneyland, everything there is perfect and a lot of their employees are on a minimum wage salary. They don't mess around. Their employees take everything seriously. Why? Because everyone there is setting an example that bad things like that don't fly. What ever your job is you need to take it seriously and be the best and most professional at that job. If you don't like your job and have enough respect for your employees to do your job properly find a new job. If you want to be this foolish, work at a clothing store not some where were people's lives could be on the line when you decide to slack off. This trip to Dog Haus could have ended in a hospital trip but God blessed me and allowed me to see what they were doing.",

I was craving a burger like it was crack and decided to order from this place and hoping it would be enough to cure my craving. I ordered the burger with the garlic aioli and played it would be good. It was delivered and from the looks I was happy. It looked juicy, cheesy, drip all over the place type of burger......but how did it taste?.........AMAZING! It was just FREAKIN AN AWAKENING. Wasn't expecting much from a hot dog place and was blown away. They use Hawaiian sweet rolls as the bun...I think it took 4 rolls. Everything about it was so great. Juicy, tasty, large, messy...etc. it's in my top 5 right now. Closer to the top. I will be back.",

It was cracker thin that I never enjoyed any rootbeer flavor or plumped cake batter as  my pic shows. The Cali and the Reservoir dogs were definitely gourmet,  but the toppings did not complement the flavorful dogs. The cheeseburger was a lot of bun, but where is the beef. Too pricey of a burger not to have enough meat for the bun. It was ordinary too. I didn't know the fries were seasoned which I didn't like. The onion rings was the best item I enjoyed for my money.  Service is great and the establishment is clean, but it didn't deliver outstanding food for the value of my money.",

    "text": "This place took over the space where Johnny rockets was. There is another hot dog place across the street but this one was finished being built first. I didn't actually make it to this one until after going to the other across the street first, though. I feel they are going to start a cross street rivalry like many single stop shops do on the east coast which, ironically, both of these places originate from...the east coast. (I stand corrected. The owner was cool enough to point out that DogHaus is NOT from the east coast....so, it's more like a east/west rivalry, lol)  Ok, so onto the review. I rolled up late and by myself. After midnight and after a long night out. Cool atmosphere, low lights and funky music on. Good seating area. Reminds me of east coast seating with long raised slim style table like a bar with stools positioned adequately spaced apart. Televisions on each row of seats.  Now the food and service...service was nice. The girl was friendly, knowledgeable and smiling. It's always kind of hard going into a new place where they have numerous unique creations because I always want to read all of the ingredients to see which one sounds the most tantalizing but I feel like a dweeb sitting there reading every single one. So, to keep the excitement moving, I usually just ask which is the most popular. The girl pointed out a few. I think this is the best way. If the best is good enough, I'll come back and have a little better idea of what to order and how to order while having more confidence from feeling like a dweeb.   Now, this place has more options of dogs or sausages and kielbasa, etc. ( fun names btw ). I got the Pig Lebowski. The sausage was great. Perfectly cooked with just enough snap from the casing from well made charcuterie. Good flavor. The toppings were tasty but actually kind of took away from the sausage, in my opinion. Was piled on a little too much. It has Cole slaw, fries and pickles with a dark sweet sauce. These are all good but being a premium sausage, I was almost tempted to wipe off the toppings and eat the sausage plain. Like I said, the sausage was great which almost made the toppings seem unnecessary. And it was a lot to eat. With the combo of drink and choice of fries and tater tots, one dog was plenty to fill me.",

    "text": "Stopped by here for a quick lunch while in the area today. Heard about this place opening a few months ago and wanted to try it but it was always out of the way.   I have no previous experience with similar places besides buldolgi's which has been in town for years.   I realized this location took over the old Johnny Rocket's spot which used to be here when i used to attend UNLV.   Walking into the establishment, immediately to the right has a small bar with a few things on tap. Lots of bar stool tables on the side.   This restaurant opens Haus Dogs (special all beef skinless dogs), Haus Sausages (hand crafted sausages), Haus Burgers (proprietary grind of chuck and brisket), sides, sliders, and desserts. Vegetarian styles available upon request.   I had decided to try something \"standard\" (is that the right word) and went for the Das Brat. Dat Brat contains a bratwurst topped with sauerkraut, caramelized onions, and whole grain mustard aioli, all in a hawaiian dinner bread \"bun\". By the design of the hawaiian breads, the only thing i found cooking myself at home was they were amazing as slider buns. When split in half for anything else, they easily fall apart. And this was no exception. Dinner breads arent big to begin with. A bratwust is probably 2/3's its size. Topped with sauerkraut and onions, its almost impossible to eat this cleanly. Even before my first bite, the bread split off and left with with a \"whole\" dinner bread section with some saurkraut. That itself tasted amazing tho xD but who doesnt like hawaiian bread with anything. The sausage itself had a pretty good chewing texture with its casing. Flavor-wise, i wish it was a little more flavorful. For the price, and something so simple, i feel like i was overpaying for what i got.   Maybe the other stuff they have offers more but nothing really stood out to me prior to ordering. Maybe i just dont know sausages... if u know what i mean hahaha",

A wave of mental exhaustion as we step into the blast furnace of the Vegas evening, someone putting it in the air (not from me).  And then...  \"I'm hungry\" someone proclaims.  \"Yeah me too.  Tacos or hot dogs\"  says another.  \"M E A T in a T U B E!\"  announces Midwest poker bud.  \"Oh brother.  Dog Haus it is\".  And that's all she wrote.  Small but rapidly expanding chain serving loaded dogs and flavorful sausages.  This isn't Biker Jim's.  No need to worry about alligator or rattlers in your sausage.  Just flavorful beef, chicken, and pork.  Good dogs and sausages with no claims of heritage pork, hormone free, antibiotic free, all natural, etc.  Choose a dog or sausage from the display case or one of the premade menu items and you're good to go.  Sub any dog or sausage ($1 extra) in any premade sandwich.  All sandwiches are made on grilled Hawaiian sweet bread rolls (three rolls for a sausage).  The sweetness makes the proteins sing.  Toppings make the dogs.  Leading the list is \"Another Night in Bangkok\".  Take the spicy Thai currywurst with its porky goodness and warming curry heat and top it with a creamy satay sauce, crushed peanuts and a pile of slaw.  Flavor town.  A close second, the \"Old Town Dog\"  Smoked bacon around a dog topped with caramelized onions, jalapenos, cheese and topped with a spicy chipotle aioli.  Salty, zesty, and satisfying at 2am.  Great chili cheese tater tots as a side.  So unhealthy but oh so good.  The only major misstep, the root beer batter corn dogs.  Soft with a strange, off putting burnt sugar bitterness.  Speedy no frills service.  Beer a plus.  HH, M-F 3pm-6pm and reverse HH, everyday 1am - 4am with two for one beer and wine.  Open late (4am).  A hyped up rating perhaps but worthy to satisfy that late night craving.",

    "text": "While continuing the subject of memorable hot dogs and assorted related American picnic fare, I just savored two great varieties at Dog Haus quite a bit closer to home.  Henry Winkler, The Fonz of \"Happy Days\" fame, should be proud of \"The Fonz,\" a nice combination of spicy Italian sausage and high-quality pastrami modulated by smooth melted Mozzarella Cheese all embedded within the confines of a large and noticeably sweet grilled King's Hawaiian Roll.  The sausage contained just the right amount of spice, and the pastrami was much more meaty than fat, and not dry like some that engender a gag reflex.  This beast on a roll was accompanied by great golden Cheese Tots which had been removed from the fryer at just the right moment and then smothered in a very tasty mild Cheese Sauce.  After a suitable respite to absorb the first round of eating, a Build Your Own Dog was next on tap for me.  After giving some thought to the matter of what among myriad available elements I would like in my dog, I settled upon free add-ons of yellow mustard, onions, tomatoes, dill pickles, and two premium ingredients requiring an extra charge: Haus Chili and sauerkraut.  When I first bit into the hefty skinless all-beef wiener, I was surprised how moist and tasty it was.  The remaining bitten top even glistened with juices as I gazed down on it before moving in for the next bite.  And, I was quite pleased that partial slices of fresh tomatoes were included instead of small bits of tomato; the white sauerkraut was first rate; and the brown chili was very nice, with a silky texture and just enough heat to make it a desirable dish in its own right without overpowering the rather complex edible construction.    Not being a purist in matters of adding ketchup to a hot dog except in the case of a classic Chicago Dog, because I generally like the taste of tomato ketchup along with yellow mustard on hot dogs and hamburgers, after one bite I opted to pour a thin trail of this red condiment along the length of my dog from the self-serve stand across the room.  After this, for me personally, enhanced by fine skin-on fries also dressed lightly in ketchup, my dog, which was encased in another grilled King's Hawaiian Roll, became near perfection on a metal tray.  Meanwhile Diane consumed her root beer-battered Corn Dog--which was bigger than most--and happily finished off the remainder of my Cheese Tots.   Service was friendly and efficient, although someone else's order was mistakenly brought to us first; loud piped in heavy metal music was a nice change of pace from Sirius's The Blend's offerings on my car's satellite radio; and wooden bench seats were comfortable enough that I was not distracted by the hard, ungiving surface.  The food had my full attention, and there was no scrimping on providing generous portions of high-quality ingredients in inventive combinations here.  I will be back soon to try a burger, which I was told by a member of the wait staff can be made medium rare to order; and to enjoy some Haus Chili on its own!",

Even though the menu has named hot dogs with certain toppings, you can really pick whatever dog type and toppings you want. I got a brats dog with spicy brown mustard, tomatoes, uncooked onions, and jalapenos and it was really good.  Service is super nice and friendly. I was wondering aloud how the coleslaw was and they offered to let me try it first. So nice!  (It was really good btw). They also have various milkshakes on the menu that sound really good but I didn't try any of them on this visit. Atmosphere is casual but nice and clean, with a bunch of large high top tables and some regular tables for 2 and 4 people. Was a great find!",

Great soundtrack, friendly and quick staff, and delicious food. I had the Ava Maria, a burger with mushrooms, cheddar cheese, and caramelized onions; my hero had The Fonz, spicy Italian sausage with pastrami and mozzarella. With drinks and sides, our total was right about $25. Everything is cooked to order, but the wait was not long at all. Hubs was impressed enough to try a milkshake after our meal! All in all, we dug it and will likely return. I think it's worth fighting the traffic on Paradise!",

Service is the same.  Menu of dogs and burgers, tots and fries has creative twists -- but nothing outside the realm of foodtrucks today. It's pricey -- $20 for 2 dogs and 2 shared tot (only complaint is when folks order well done tots -- that crispety crunchy and seriously browning - not whitish, mealy, cold inside...)  Did I complain? nope - my bad.  Red thai chili currydog was seriously spicy -- which was a nice surprise.  And buns? They use toasted Hawaiian rolls in varying fractions (3 x 1 long for dogs, 2 x 2 for burgers, 1 x 1 for sliders: clever...  Great addition to selection of near campus eateries...good luck! see you again soon!",

They have happy hour specials. There are multiple beer, wine, and cocktail offerings. They have adult milkshakes and regular milkshakes.   You order at the counter, receive a number to put on your table, and then your food is brought to you. You can create your own or order from a variety of their creations. They have hot dogs (duh), sausages, burgers, sliders, fries, tater tots, and onion rings.  We ordered the Scott Baioli dog (smoked bacon, white american cheese, garlic aioli, caramelized onions) and The Love Boat (fries or tots with chili and cole slaw). Seriously delicious! It was hot dog perfection. All high-quality ingredients. The dog was perfectly cooked. The bun was great. Everything about it was stellar. The fries were so yum too. The chili had a wonderful flavor. It reminded me of Ben's Chili Bowl in DC. And the cole slaw was perfect. I'm not usually a fan cole slaw, but it was darn tasty.   All the staff were very nice and friendly. Tip: Locals can get a card that gives you 10% off. It's definitely worth a trip here. I'm already craving another hot dog and more chili fries.",

I begged them to open a Vegas location, and finally they granted my wish! Unfortunately, my favorite (the Pig & the Fig) didn't make the Vegas menu, but don't let that stop you from finding your favorite!  SOOO CALI: The spicy basil aioli is amazing, but the avocado and crispy onions give it great texture too! A fun explosion of fresh flavors.  RESERVOIR DOG: a kicked-up take on your usual chili dog, with slaw and mustard, was my guy's favorite. Heads up, the chili is spicier than expected! SCOTT BAIOLI: I got this for the garlic aioli and caramelized onions but was underwhelmed. Sauce didn't have much flavor, felt like the choice of cheese didn't really fit the other flavors.  THE COWBOY: bacon, white American cheese, onions, and bbq sauce somehow didn't come together for the wild ride I'd anticipated.  SIDES/SHAKES: Vanilla shake was super-thick, I hear the salted caramel version is even better. Tots and fries are crispy and salted, add cheese sauce if you're not concerned about a coronary.   Even on busy opening day, service was friendly and organized. The industrial decor and hard-rock music give this spot a fun identity. Heads up, your vegetarian friends can enjoy the food too: they offer a vegetarian hot dog AND two different veggie sausages!",

I love that they use those yummy little King's Hawaiian sweet buns to house the dogs.  Super creative :)  For those that enjoy variety or do not like to eat as much, they have \"mini\" versions of the hot dogs which are 1 Hawaiian bun size vs. the normal serving size which is 3 Hawaiian buns.  They offer multiple hot dogs and sausages that you can sub in to any of the menu offerings :)  What we got:  - Chili dog- sub REAL cheddar cheese for that nasty artificial nacho cheese (LOL yuck), fresh onions and \"Haus\" chili.  SO YUM.  All-beef hot-dog is a must get and is super yummy. - Root-beer battered corn dog- I was not able to taste the root beer, but this corn dog was pretty tasty!! - Fries- have been hit or miss the times that we have been here.  It has been good/okay about 50% of the time.  You won't miss them if you don't get them.  UberEats delivers, but it is not the same as being in the store.  Service is very friendly and you can tell that the staff really cares for the customers.  I highly recommend this place!!",

The shake was super thick id recommend it.  Update, sorry I had to drop from 4 stars to 1, I have not been feeling good since, maybe it had something to do with the actual hot dog not really being all that hot.

I have mentioned Dog Haus to my Vegas friends and family and no one has heard of the place - yet. The Vegas location is fairly new, so I'm sure the word will spread quickly.  Dog Haus creates some of the best Bratwursts i have had the pleasure of putting in my face. You can order off the menu or create your own so the possibilities are nearly endless.  I had my usual - \"Another Night in Bangkok\" with the Nurenberg brat instead of the spicy brat. It comes with Thai peanut sauce, a refreshing slaw and crushed peanuts all served up on a toasted Hawaiian sweet bread bun. AMAZING! I washed it all down with lemonade.  I've been to a Dog Haus location about eight times (including the LA location) and I have not even tried their hamburgers yet. The reason is that their bratwurst are the best I've ever eaten.  I hope the Las Vegas Dog Haus becomes as big a hit as it is in LA. Pretty sure it will.",

The dogs are creatively thought out combos with an artful presentation. I had the veggie dog tonight. It is piled high with arugula, avocado, and some sort of crispy onion things plus a spicy aioli sauce to juice it up. Now for the bun and hold onto your hats here.....it's three toasted Kings Hawaiian sweet rolls still connected straight out of the package. If you've had Kings sweet rolls I need not explain the sweet collaboration of tastes this is invoking. Very interesting twist! Kudos to the combo designer. I accompanied my dog with your standard yet satisfying good old fashioned French fries. They offer a variety of craft beers(always a plus) to quench your thirst or grab an all you can drink fountain soda.   The dining room is what I would describe as an industrial, loft type feeling motif. It was clean and spacious. Out front is a couple tables also.    Service was prompt and kind.",

    "text": "Aside from a certain local business with a Korean-inspired name and a Strip location of a famous colorful LA institution, I wouldn't say that I have much experience with gourmet hot dogs. After tonight's visit, I'm starting to feel that I've been missing out.  Dog Haus is another sausage slinger imported from LA, one of at least 3 that come to mind. Had I not known about them before one of their LA locations was recently highlighted on a Travel Channel show, I would have probably gone anyway eventually. I can be a bit of a sucker for those places shown on TV though, and I ended up going sooner than I'd thought.  This Vegas outpost is in a certain very crowded Harmon/Swenson/Paradise-bordered plaza near the Strip, and I was fortunate not to go at anywhere near a peak hour. After carefully perusing the menu with my friend, we agreed to share some food so that we could enjoy a slightly more comprehensive introduction.  Old Town Dog ($6.99, same as their other \"Haus Dogs\"): everything packed a big flavor punch here. The sweet Hawaiian rolls (three of which are pulled from a package and split down the middle) and the plump bacon-wrapped dog might've been enough alone, but the sweet and soft caramelized onions, the spicy pickled jalapenos, the chipotle aioli, and the cotija cheese made it a party. It feels like a fairly \"safe\" flavor profile but isn't boring in the slightest, and I'd definitely recommend it.  Another Night In Bangkok ($7.99, same as their other \"Haus Sausages\"): also comes on Hawaiian rolls, but features a spiced Thai currywurst instead of a beef dog. I expected it to be spicier based on the concept and how they sold it on the TV show, but it was pleasantly mild. The peanut sauce sold me enough on the Thai concept, and the crunchy flavorful slaw really sealed the deal. I think it had less dimensions of flavor, but it lingered on the taste buds longer.  Fries ($2.99 a la carte, $3.49 with a combo): I was expecting them to be fluffier, but at least these thick-cut potato pieces had a crunch. There's a bit of an odd flavor from the oil, but the right amount of ketchup completely masks it and complements the fries overall. I no longer felt displeased to have to chew on the fries for one or two extra bites because the delay allows the combination of starch and vinegary sweetness to marry perfectly. Not a necessary side, but a very desirable one unless, heavens forbid, a ketchup shortage suddenly strikes.  Dog Haus seems to have found a winning tube meat formula with delicious ingredients through and through, and I'd be very happy to go back sooner rather than later as long as I don't run into parking issues in that jam-packed plaza. It's definitely the first hot dog restaurant on my local list for now.",

If that drink reference goes over your head, you should probably leave the burbs more often.   The Dog Haus, a Cali based restaurant with a laid back feel and professionally built hot dogs. On my first visit I went with the Downtown Dog stacked with smoked bacon, caramelized onions, pickled peppers, mayo, mustard and ketchup. Flavor bombasaurus! So good, so messy and so satisfying, you will be full after eating this dog.   The second go around was a total sausage fest, The Pig Lebowski was calling my name and so were the extra carbs that accompanied it. A Polish kielbasa with coleslaw, bbq sauce and topped with french fries! The crunchy coleslaw mixed with spicy BBQ was so good and the kielbasa has perfect snap when I chomped into it.   What makes this place so amazing is the use of Hawaiian Sweet Rolls as the buns instead of the traditional roll or pretzel roll. The bread is super soft molds to the dog instead of falling apart and creating a mess. The dog may take a little longer than normal, but everything is made fresh to order and come out piping hot, it's worth the wait.    Beers, brats, and smothered tots. Please sir, may I have some more?!",

Service: 5/5, greeted us with a smile as we walked in & as we walked out. They give you a number after you order & serve you whenever it's ready. Also was given recommendations on the menu!   First impression: Clean & spacious. Plenty of tables for everyone. Extensive menu, allows for tons of substitutes if you're that person lol.   Food: Ordered the old town dog ($6.99), upgraded to a spicy Italian sausage ($0.99), and made it a combo with fries instead of tater tots ($3.49)... Which totaled out to about $12.   The old town dog consisted a smoked bacon wrapped dog, pickled jalapenos (which is what had me sold), chipotle aioli, caramelized onions, and cotija cheese. They overload that thing with allllll the condiments. Too many onions IMO. But the fact that I got a spicy Italian sausage instead of a hot dog, made it 10x better than it would've been. I'm a spicy kind of gal.  And did I mention they use Hawaiian bread as a hot dog bun??? RIP.   Overall, 5 stars for the experience. But I feel like major crap right now because I never really eat hot dogs/sausages. Go ahead, make all the jokes you want!!!!!!!!!!!",

    "text": "Randomly found this cool spot right on the edge of the strip near UNLV.   I decided to try the Old Town Dog - bacon wrapped hot dog smothered in caramelized onions, pickled jalapenos, topped with chipotle aioli and cotija cheese, and the best part - on a hawaiian roll! Never thought to try a hot dog with a hawaiian roll, but it was an interestingly good combination.   My friend on the other hand tried the Ringer burger - smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, onion rings, and bbq sauce. I took a bite of her burger and it was good but I still preferred my hot dog more. I'm a huge fan of hot dogs in general and have been trying to find a good spot in Vegas for quite some time now. I know there are quite a few spots in the area but this one was pretty darn good!",

Came across Dog Haus on Instagram and thought it looked very interesting...and reviews sounded great so I thought we should give it a try. 1st off it is in a really great strip mall with lots of things around..I have probably driven past this mall 100 times and never realized anything in it. They had GREAT music playing as we walked in and very friendly staff..plus plus! Great start! We then grabbed a menu and sat down. Great names for each menu item.  I am boring so I got the all beef hot dog with cheese sauce and mustard and the cheese fries!! The dogs are served on Hawaiian bread rolls...amazing idea. The dog was cooked perfectly and the cheese sauce...mmmm mmmm good. Perfect ratio of cheese to dog and mustard.  The man must have been in the mood for chili since all 3 items he ordered were covered with it. He had chili cheese tots...the chili idol dog and the reservoir hog which was a Polish sausage with chili, slaw and mustard. He was not sure how he would feel about slaw and chili together...welll.....it was down in the belly in about 5 mins...I'd say he enjoyed it! Chili is hard...it's either really good, ok or terrible. Luckily for him it was really good!!! I kept sneaking bites of his tots! We will definitely be back to try more concoctions!!!",

Veggie dog had a good flavor but didn't have that satisfying *snap* Dog Haus piles it all on  toasted & buttered King's Hawaiian rolls -- a unique take on the traditional, boring hot dog bun.   As long as I have the option to order a veggie dog, I'd come back to indulge in an Old Town Dog or Corn Dog.   Open late, a decent alternative to tacos at 3am.",

I would give 5 stars but, the location isn't in the spot Doghaus's usually are. Not really poppin that side of the strip. The Doghaus at Victoria Gardens, Rancho Cucamonga has a more social feel. That does not take away from the service I got though, which was awesome! The food  was cooked perfectly! The beer was cold!",

This place is in a shopping center next to a cvs and it's charging gourmet prices for mediocre food. It was edible but I will not ever be back for one of these hot dogs again. 30$ for 2 hot dogs and fries .. not worth at all. I would say the hot dog should at least be bigger but than that's just more of a horrible hotdog I would have to force myself to eat.",

We ordered the following: corn dog, tator tots, 1 cocky balboa park and burger. For the most part everything was okay. I had the cocky balboa, it looked delicious however, I almost lost a tooth in the process of eating it. I did not realize it was lathered in sauce and condiments to hide the charred chicken sausage underneath. I was being exposed to carcinogens! I contacted Dog Haus that night, ( 7/18/18) and a young lady answered the phone. I explained the issue with the cocky balboa and she informed me that I needed to contact Postmates to get a refund. Mind you, it was almost 9pm and my dinner options were slim. I did not want a refund . I wanted to eat my dinner. After a 10 minute discussion about how irrational that was, she finally told me they would remake the Cocky Balboa. Of course, I had to go pick it up. There was no apology or no partial refund for delivery. Terrible customer service all around.",

The French fries and tater tots were crispy  and yummy . The Bloody Mary was made with Absolute Pepper and came with a slice of bacon and skewer of tater  tots. The drink was not very strong but good flavor. Not a huge selection of beers to choose from either by cans or on tap. Service was friendly, fast and helpful.

We ordered the Cowboy and the Little Leaguer with tots and fries. Everything was on point. Perfectly cooked and it did not take long at all after ordering. The buns are toasted Hawaiian rolls and taste amazing. The staff that took our order and served us were friendly. CLEAN bathrooms.  Only issue I had was with an employee who, I'm assuming, was on break. This employee was in the seating area and was watching UFC greatest hits on his cellphone. The soda machine was out of ice when I tried to get my drinks. This employee looked up and went back to his phone. I notified the other employees and the friendly girl who took my order quickly went to the back to get more ice. When she asked the other employee for help he rolled his eyes and wasn't much help since he wouldn't put down his phone. If you're gonna be on break, go hang out outside or in the back and not out with the customers where it would be nice to have assistance when needed. Not going to let that employee ruin the 5 stars that this place deserves. This place is refreshing and really good! I will def be back here.",

Also, my dog could've been a little warmer - it was warm, but maybe I was expecting hot, like right off the grill hot.

My eyes went straight to the \"so Cali\". Sounded amazing but didn't taste as amazing as I thought it would be. The sauces they have are delicious though, I believe are homemade. They use Hawaiian sweet rolls instead of hot dog buns and I guess they're going for the sweet and savory but I really think the Hawaiian buns takes away the goodness of the sausage itself and the rest of the toppings. My boyfriend ordered the downtown dog which is a bacon wrapped dog, and he said it was nothing special and also didn't like the overpowering of the Hawaiian roll. The chili cheese tots are yummy though. The tots are nicely fried and crispy and golden brown. The chili is good too. Honestly, I would highly recommended to order one of the specialty sausages they have which was our mistake. We just had an all beef dog which taste the same everywhere in our opinion. But they have like polish, and veal and pork dogs.",
