    "text": "Upon entering Forte on my initial visit, my first thought was that it was very European. This wasn't just because it was dead at lunch, as most restaurants in Europe are, but also because of the eccentric decor, dark lounge-like feel, off-the-beaten-path location, and genuine hospitality. That, and the fully stocked bar featuring very cheap glasses of delicious European wines (this I would find out later).  I've over-ordered Forte at twice now, and though I can't say everything on the small plates menu is a winner, I can say I will keep coming back due to the aforementioned charming qualities and a few unique, inexpensive food highlights.  The menu is broken down by European country (mostly Eastern) and their corresponding regional specialties. Under Russia, you won't find any caviar or borscht, but you will find adjarkski kachapurri, which goes down the hatch more easily than it rolls off the tongue ($6.99). This consists of a freshly baked bread loaf akin to a short, fat French baquette, that is hollowed in the center and stuffed with cheese, butter, and a raw egg. If I lost you at 'raw egg' then let me elaborate. The egg is mixed in table-side and is cooked by the heat of the bread, turning the dish into a protein-filled vegetarian friendly dish that will change your mind about Russian food. The flavor of the crusty bread combined with the egg and cheese reminded me of a quiche, yet this was unlike anything I've ever had. Extra (yet unnecessary) points for that!  The section from Spain features a variety of chorizo sausages, amongst other items. We had the chistora and bilbao (each $2.50) which were fantastically charred and of fantastic value. These rivaled the Polish links at Costco as far as sausage bargains go, and were much better in my opinion.  One note selections included the chicken skewers ($3.25 each), sauteed shrimp ($6.50), and the Bulgarian shopski served in an adorable clay pot ($6.99). Though there are a few minor flops, the thing I love most about this place is that you can try a lot of different foods you've probably never heard of, and, if you don't like them, you haven't spent enough to regret having given them a whirl.  Coming back to the wine, I ordered a glass of Spanish Cosechero Blanco, which I was told cannot be found anywhere else in Vegas. Guess how much? $4.50!! The owner of the restaurant, who was our waitress on my second visit, and a gem in and of herself, offered to sell me a bottle at wholesale cost when I mentioned I liked it. So, I got a bottle for later that cost me just $8.20. That pretty much sealed the deal for me!  This is a place you have to be experimental and open-minded to go to, but if you appreciate other cultures and want to join me on my mission to support the mom and pops in Vegas, then you'll have no trouble mustering the strength to go to Forte.",

The service is fast, friendly,  and helpful.  Everything we ate was delicious.   On the table is this spice mix and I suggest putting it on everything!   I bought some to use at home.  Anytime we are in vegas we are coming here and I suggest you do the same.",

They have a great variety of dishes to choose from, but we selected a few.  We tried:   MIxed Tapas Plate Pitcher of Sangria Stuffed Grape Leaves Chicken Shich Kabob and for dessert... Tiramisu with Baileys coffee easy whip ;)  I thought the Mixed Tapas plate was mediocre and not as exciting as the establishment's environment.  The tasty kabobs, flavorful grape leaves and striking sangria definitely made up for it.  I would go back to try other items on the menu, but would definitely order the sangria and grape leaves again!",

We went on a Saturday and even though the sign said it was open, the restaurant did not open until noon.  Ran errands and returned to some very spotty service.  We had to ask for water refills and the deal breaker is having not bringing both dishes out at the same time.  We'd never been to this place and it would have been nice if the server would have explained what some of the dishes were before just leaving it up to their menu descriptions but she was in somewhat of a hurry since it appeared she was the only server.  Not likely to return but glad we went there to try.  A little pricey for what we got but you live and learn.",

The food we had was all solid. I cannot say the same about the drink menu. With there being a large jump in price from the house wine to the next selection, I opted for the house red. It tasted like Kool-Aid. I would have tried a second glass, but the aforementioned service prevented that from going down. The specialty drinks on the menu all looked like they would rot your teeth. Unfortunately, throwing sugary ingredients into a cocktail glass is a common trend these days, and Forte is no different. The atmosphere is charming and cozy. I may try Forte again and hope that the staff is less chaotic.",

    "text": "Atmosphere, service, and taste add up to an experience that makes for a full dining experience.   I was initially overwhelmed when I walked through the door. The space is plastered with posters of music artist, propaganda pieces, and a hodge podge of colorful artwork. The dimly lit room tames everything down, but also makes it look like a dive bar. The elongated dining area is spaced out with a total of maybe 10 tables. A few stools line the bar and a few tables are located in the front as well. During the winter months, those tables near the entrance will not be so enticing with the constant opening and closing of the door.  Our server, Elliot, was pleasant. Although he was taking care of the entire back area, he was able to control the pace.   Our drinks took some time to come out, but with two people working the whole front of the house it is to be expected. The cocktails are not as balanced as I would like. I got the ginger lemonade and liked the spiciness of the ginger infused vodka. The citrus and sweetness was almost too much. It was as if all of these components were fighting for supremacy.   The food was solid. The bread boat stuffed with cheese and a raw egg, adjarski khachapurri, was the it dish to try. The only thing we heard about from the tables around us was this dish was featured in Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. When Elliot presented it, we were impressed by how hot the content was. The center of the boat is hot enough to cook the egg when mixed with a fork. Tearing into this beauty with a light sprinkling of seasoning from the complementary bread was divine. Another dish worth trying is the beef and lamb confit served on a bed of rice. The starch is mixed with dried fruit, whole roasted garlic cloves, and herbs. We had also ordered the bacon wrapped dates because it is a staple when ordering tapas. Unfortunately they were not a hit. I did enjoy the sherry reduction. I ended up dipping the bread in it. Make sure to save room for the biscuit cake. It is prepared like a tiramisu and is ambrosial. I would scale back on the tapas to eat two of these.",

Please never order it there. The person who prepared it should go straight to culinary hell.   Borsht is not a bowl of roughly chopped crunchy vegetables lacking any taste or  flavour including salt.   My second choice was Hungarian Goulash. Although I am not an expert on this I am capable to figure out that this dish should be not what I got: old starchy mashed potatoes covered with the sauce way too spicy for a goulash (think Indian or Thai level) with 5 tiny pieces of meat.   I guess the waitress may have known that she is serving food not suitable for human consumption and therefore has never asked how was it.   I am glad I didn't invite my friends to experience Easter European food at this place. I would be really embarrassed.",

    "text": "Local friends recommend this place so I did no Yelp snooping beforehand, but it turned out to be a huge hit. I will say that food/flavor/atmosphere-wise it deserved 5 stars. However, there were only 2 servers working on a busy Thursday night and although they were trying hard, it definitely hampered the experience a bit.    Unfortunately, most of the food was ordered from our friend's memory so I'll have to just describe it rather than name it. Now, about the food:  Starter Salads:  They ordered two, both of which were topped with generous helpings of a very light and fluffy feta cheese. It sounds like it could be overbearing, but it wasn't and totally worked with each. The first was like a traditional Greek salad with tomatoes, cucumbers, and of course the fresh feta. The second had watermelon and basil with the feta. Both were light, fresh, and very tasty in their own idiom.   Sleeper pick We got two helpings of a hot and fluffy pizza crust type bread with a fried egg in the middle. You stir the egg yolk around on top and then tear off chunks of this very tasty seasoned puffy bread slathered in the egg yolk. Words again can't do it justice, but it is sooooo good! Order one just to try and you may have to double down like we did. You are in Vegas after all.   Main Course Dishes: We had the Eastern Lamb dish (can't remember the actual Russian title but it was two words with a lot more consonants in a row than usual). It was cooked just a hair too well done for my taste, but in all fairness I didn't order and specify the temperature. The seasoning and flavor was bold and very tasty.  We also got what was described as \"Siberian Burgers\" which was cooked perfectly and incredibly flavorful. I highly recommend this.   The ambiance was very eclectic with EDM versions of the latest dance songs playing in the background, but not overbearingly loud. The lighting is low, but the walls and furniture seemed to be painted and bedazzled gypsy style, which makes you feel like your in the Eastern Bloc and not West of the Vegas Strip.   I would definitely come back and recommend Forte to friends wanting to eat in a local gem.",

You know how some restaurants lose quality over time, NOT FORTE, they just keep getting better and better.   Diners, Drive Ins and Dives Guy Fieri did a segment about Forte. He couldn't say enough great things about Forte and they are ALL True. In fact, I believe that Nina and her father, Stephan were the only people to ever PUNK Guy. It was hilarious.

The food is good, we ordered chorizo en vino and it was amazing!  My boyfriend ordered the Bulgaria goulash, which was a small but decent plate! We also tasted the hot pot, which had a very interesting flavor! Sausage, tomatoes, onion n eggs.. If you dont like eggs too much do not get it as this is the main ingredient!  Overall the place is very interesting, you need to come and check it out for your self!",

The restaurant itself is very cute. I loved the decorations, the booths were comfortable, and even the plates were cute. They started us with bread, Spanish olive oil, and that paprika mix. Already happy there. We ended up getting a few items: almond stuffed dates, stroganoff fries,  lamb chop lollipops, stuffed grape leaves, and pelmeni. Each item was better than the last. Honestly, their stuffed grape leaves were the best I can remember having. Warning that the lamb is only two pieces. Delicious, but small portion on that one. Everything else was portioned better. The pelmeni was kinda like a potsticker, in case you were questioning it. At the end of the night, we got the biscuit cake. I will have dreams about this cake, I swear. It's like if tiramisu didn't suck, met up with some halva, and had a beautiful child. Our waitress saw that my family ate most of it while I was away from the table, so ended up bringing me an extra slice. I just about died. It has been hours since we left, and even though I'm stuffed, I'm just waiting to go back. Not just for the food, but for the wonderful service as well.",

Even though I believe there is rarely a good reason to provide bad service.  We decided to give them a try anyway, so glad we did.  Upon arriving we were promptly greated and seated.  Forte is cute and clean. (See pics) we got there about 8:45pm on a Monday evening.  There was only 1 othere fam. there.  Our server was prompt and eager to help with the menu once he heard we had never been there before.  All our food arrived in a timely manner with the exception of the clay pot.  Now I'm not complaining, this is just a heads up.  I knew this going in so we were patient.  Everything came out very hot and with great presentation and it was all as good as it looked.  We will definitely be going back.  Btw.  The clay pot was awesome.  Next time we will order it upon arriving since it does take about 35 min to make.  I guess you can't rush perfection.",

This fits that to a T.   Fist of of the interior is eclectic and inviting.  You know just from the ambiance that you are in for an experience.      Our waitress was from Bulgaria and she was great.  She explained their menu and the origination of the items on the menu.  I had seen the Thracian Clay Pot and was not disappointed with this amazing delight.   Although somewhat smaller than I expected it was still everything I though it would be.  I mixed everything together as instructed and just sat back and had my food moment of Zen.      We also had the  Ragu which was amazing also.  The Ragu part was perfectly done and the Beef Stroganoff was so creamy and tasty.  Everyone loved it and couldn't stop raving about how good it was.  We also had the Pelmini which was just a delight and the sour cream was the prefect accompaniment.      My main course was the Bulgarian Mixed Grill.  The sausages were all unique and very tasty.  The pepper sauce was great with the pieces of sausage.  Again everyone loved this as we shared it.  I have to say this place lived up to the hype and was the unique experience I was craving.  I can't wait to go back and try more things on the menu.",

On weekends they have free live music which is nice and relaxing.  Their food is very Eastern European. Think Kabobs, goulash, and egg bread bowls. So it's really a mixture of typical dishes with new different ones. If you are from Bulgaria or Russia you will probably recognize a lot of the menu.   My favorite things here are the strawberry cider beer, the egg and pickled cheese bread bowl and the biscuit cake. The cider is just so fresh and It seriously tastes like juice. Refreshing, delicious and low on calories. The pickled cheese and egg bread bowl sounds and looks weird I know but it is seriously amazing. The bread is freshly baked and you are in for a delicious treat with this. Weird but worth it. The biscuit cake is homemade and so delicious there are no other words. Just know on my day off I have driven all the way to forte just to take home some biscuit cake. So worth it.   Overall great place have been back a bunch of times and plan to go again!",

My boyfriend spent the past three years in Europe, so his hopes were high for quality eastern European food and this place did not disappoint!  You walk in to a cool atmosphere with lots of nick-knacks and interesting artwork. All food is tapas style, small playes that are easy to share. We tried the Hungarian goulash, homemade pickles, shrimp in white wine sauce, and a small hot pot. Everything was delicious!!! We will definitely be coming back.  Our waitress was Bulgarian (as is most of the staff, she told us) and she was extremely helpful. She even told me how to make the shrimp dish at home! Cant wait to go back!  UPDATE: We came back on 8/1/15 and were sorely disappointed. The Salyanka we ordered was so salty it was inedible. Then our entrees (burger and chicken kabob) were also painfully salty. We left hungry. :( i did tell the waiter the truth when he stopped by, telling him our food was far too salty. He offered his condolences but couldnt offer us any solution.",

Ok..try like everything.    They have the best seasoning, right at the table. Mix it with the oil for your bread. The octopus on rice has so much flavor.  We usually get the lamb and beef confit..it has pickles also to enhance the flavor.  The fries are crisp and perfect. Never burnt or soggy. Pelmeni is so good, I'd come just for that.  Whatever cheese they use in the breads...are fresh and flavorful. The thracian clay pot is a must try. The egg on top is runny, but it's good.  Pierogis are good too. Can't remember the name of the serbian dish we had,  but it's a burger with a cheese spread and chopped onions.  The meat is seasoned and has a very nice spice combo,  which is situated with tender bread. It's actually really big, so share it with someone if you're planning to eat other tapas.  Decor is funky with an underground appeal, very cool and not overdone. Service is always excellent.  Sadly I posted this after deleting pics off my phone,  otherwise I'd have a few.",

    "text": "In Vegas...this is a good as it gets for great food at AMAZING PRICES. Let me stick with the value comment here....Literally, nothing costs more than $10. If you're tired of the usual hotel eateries and yes there are hundreds of absolutely amazing places in LV, try Forte. I found this place, er should I say my husband found it watching diners drive in's and dives (a show I can't watch but he LOVES) - Paul and I have been to a few of the show's recommendations in L.A. and they weren't bad so I was not adverse to the suggestion of having lunch away from the usual confines of the strip hotels, plus I was excited to bring my girlfriend Zana, who recently moved to town, to a place that served some menu items from her homeland of Serbia.   We arrive at the restaurant in a fairly large but unassuming strip mall, and walk into the just the cutest place ever. Art on the walls, deep rich colors and a huge beautiful bar and a small cozy dining room. For lunchtime on a holiday week it was crowded enough so that my party of 6 had to wait a few minutes for a table large enough to seat us opened up. The owner was so sweet and nice offering my pre-teen nieces flavored sodas from Spain while we waited and sipped our wine.  Serbian Hamburger....don't knock the name. It was the best thing I had there among amazing stuffed grape leaves, grilled meats, rich chickpea soup and the lamb and beef confit over rice was almost like a jumbalaya. Other good picks are the pan con tomate and this dish that comes in a super hot individual pot that has beef/sausage, tomatos, onions, spices, an amazing broth, cheese and an egg for good measure. It's apparently an very old dish dating back to ancient Greece.  I am soooo going back for dinner next time and will take a taxi and leave the kids so we can take our time and enjoy the wine.",

This was my first visit so I ordered the Bulgarian Mixed Grill which had 3 different types of sausage all made from scratch and delicious.  It came with a white bean salad and a tomato sauce dip.I  rate that dish 10 for 10.. The waitress suggested I try the Vareniki which was a potato dumpling with fried onions and OMG she was right another hit.  Food was soo good I had to bring my room mate home some Beef Stroganoff and Baklava for both of us.  Did I mention the atmosphere and service were great also and we sere surprised with some entertainment also..I will be returning to try other things on the menu... By the way everything was priced reasonably with good portions.",

We tried all 3 dishes which were featured on the show (Adjarski, Tracian Clay Pot, and Mixed Grille) as well as the almond stuffed dates and the Garlic Fries.  The only thing we didn't have room for was the biscuit cake for dessert. Food was great and lets get to the good stuff, the cocktails.    Must try the Angry Ginger lemonade with ginger infused vodka.  Also, my wife had the Sangria and she said it was the best she's ever had.  Finally, we tried a taste of Gypsy Juice.  Nina won't tell you whats in it but it is tasty.  All the drinks are very interesting and they even have a Russian beer.  Finally, atmosphere. Dark reds and Eastern European with a lot of interesting stuff to look at.  Overall, it was a small bistro thats easy to miss, but well worth the visit. Be sure to visit a fellow UNLV Rebel...",

    "text": "I heard this place was small so I was nervous they were not going to be able to accommodate my party of 10 on Sunday night. Luckily, everything worked out perfectly as they seated us at their large family table with benches. I think there was only one other table of customers so we basically had the restaurant to ourselves! Sunday nights must not be a big night for them but we didn't mind.  Regardless, this place is really funky inside. The artwork on the walls, the music, and the vibe offers a fun and offbeat experience. They have a fairly extensive selection of beers, wine, and cocktails. I had the Angry Ginger cocktail which was basically ginger infused vodka in lemonade with muddled mint. It was like a mojito lemonade, but with a ginger kick. Delicious!  We shared two orders of the Georgian bread for the table. This is their famous boat bread with the egg and the cheese in the middle. It was a huge hit! It takes a little longer because it's baked fresh right then and there but once it hit the table, everyone dove in.   The menu is kind of funky so with a party of ten, we just jumped in and ordered a ton of items. We ordered a few Spanish tapas for the table, then a few entrees to share. Some people ordered soups and salads, etc. Overall, I think we did it the perfect way. There wasn't a morsel of food left over and everyone left satisfied. Not one person was unhappy with the food. It was truly delicious and fresh. They are really doing it right in that kitchen!  I had to order the clay plot specialty after having read all about it on yelp and seeing it on Triple D. Once it arrived, I was surprised - it was really not anything special. I thought it was going to blow me away but almost every other entree was much more of a delight. I would skip it next time.   Highlights were: Georgian bread, Beef Strogenoff, Pelmeni, Mixed Grill plate.",

In the menu it's not mentioned how much vodka do you get for the price of $14 ( which is like in bulgaria considered a small vodka or 50 ml) this isn't written on there so when you order a glass of vodka they ask you big or small and the BIG ONE it's not on the menu 100 ml its $28!!!!!!!!! I have been to fancy restaurants, 17 course mega luxury ones and NEVER ever seen just a vodka ( without the mixer or made like a cocktail) to be $28. So there you go at the end you had 3 drinks and your bill is $84 thats without the juice or the red bull, WHhhhaaaaTTT?????? Our eyes popped out. Where are we? Please consider if going to this place, don't order alcohol - WAY OVERPRICED!! portions are super small too, like you are doing fine dining but without the fine dining atmosphere lol. It'a regular looking restaurant with price of a 7 star place in Dubai. Beware!",

    "text": "While searching on Yelp* for our weekly \"food adventure\" with my girlfriend, we came across Forte mainly because the Spain/Bulgaria description intrigued us!    Located in a strip mall, Forte Tapas R & B has an unassuming exterior but boasts a mixture of Spanish/Eastern European kitsch that's not offensive to the eyes.  It offers indoor and outdoor seating but during our visit we opted for indoor to take in the ambiance of the decor.  (We would've sat outside  but during our visit, there was a food truck gathering that was blaring out really bad hip hop music.  That and the temperature was a million degrees that August 25th evening!)  We were seated promptly and our waitress take our drink order.  My girlfriend and I shared the Bulgarian beer called \"Zagorka\", which was  light and clean tasting with no lingering aftertaste.  We order the standard Almond Stuffed Dates, which was tasty.  Unless you are incompetent, you really can't screw up this easy dish!  My girlfriend orders the Lentil Soup, which she found to be very flavorful and earthy as lentils are by nature.  She also orders the Beef Stroganoff Ragu to round out her meal, which was very light and not overly cloying and rich as cream based meals tend to be.    I ordered the Stuffed Baby Squid in Ink over Spanish Herbed Rice (Calamares Rellenos en su Tinta) for myself.  After watching \"Bizzare Foods\" I was always on the hunt for a restaurant that served mollusks marinated in its own ink.  All I can say is, \"Wow!\"  Do yourselves a favor, gentle readers and try this dish!  You may thank me later!  I also order the Chorizo simmered in Red Wine (Chorizo con Vino), which was good but left a somewhat oily aftertaste.    Service was very attentive and knowledgeable when asked about the menu and establishment.  Our water glasses were never empty and the wait staff were quick and prompt and also took the time to chat with us, asking us how we liked the food.  I highly recommend this restaurant, especially when our bill came out to less than $55, minus the tip.  This place is a great alternative to FireFly if one finds that venue to be too crowded and loud.",

I saw forte on food network and knew that it would be a great spot. I got the Thoracian clay pot and when I read the description, I thought I knew what to expect, but I was wrong! I thought the dish was a lot more simple than what it actually tastes like. It took me for a surprise and a good one at that. It is packed with flavor! My boyfriend and I also shared the adjarski khachapurri which was so delicious. I highly recommend it. He got the Bulgarian Easter lamb which was super juicy, tender and it just melts in your mouth. It kind of reminded me of oxtail because of how tender it was. I gave them 4 stars and I would have done 5, but my only complaint is the portion because I was still a little hungry when I had left lol.",

He remembers my fave song, and plays it for me without being prompted (hotel california ) !!! Great family owned restaurant, the owner ,Nina is so nice she walks around and greets everyone. The servers there are all friends and you can tell, really friendly fun atmosphere. I haven't even started on the food!!!!!  My husband is so picky, he hates everything, but he LOVES this place. He's from another country and american restaurants just don't cut it for him. They cook basic foods, hardly any seasonings, basically cooked with no feeling at all.  You can tell this food was cooked with love, you can just taste it. Such intricate flavors! I could seriously close my eyes and point at the menu and whatever I choose will be amazing! ( I've actually done that before hehe!)  Every time we go, we bring new friends to spread the word of how amazing this place is. And we look really cool knowing a hot spot like this :)",

    "text": "Forte has been on my radar for years.  Ever since I saw it on \"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.\"  I don't know why it took me so long to get here but I finally did the other night.  And now I am kicking myself for not making it in sooner because it is so good.  From the food to the friendly hospitality asking me how the food was, how my beer was, if I needed more ice for my water.  This was well worth the visit, long as it may have taken me to get around to.  I had a wonderful meal sitting alone in the back corner of the dining room observing all the art work and people spread throughout the establishment.  It wasn't overly busy on a Tuesday evening around 5:30 but there were a few groups of people.  One small group outside, a small group inside, a larger group a little closer to where I sat, and a couple.  I could not tell if they all could hear the music playing or if they were even paying attention to it but I can tell you that I was rocking out.  I sat almost directly below the speaker.  I closed my eyes and was suddenly transported to an Eastern European night club (think \"Eurotrip\").  I half expected to hear \"Scotty Doesn't Know\" at any moment.  I'm not always into dance hall type music but in this case, it was fitting.  My meal started with the complimentary bread basket with a saucer of olive oil sprinkled with the spice blend sitting on each table.  I know there was a little bit of salt in the blend.  Beyond that, I am at a loss.  It was good though and that is all that matters.    Next up on my tour of the menu was a Bulgarian beer, Zakorga, which came with a complimentary meat plate.  On this plate was four pieces of cured meat similar to salami in appearance, two gerkins and an olive complete with pit.  The meat was not as salty or spicy as salami.  Rather it was the sweet nuttyness of a natural dry cured meat almost like a prosciutto.  What a perfect accompaniment to a beer.      To start my actual meal, I ordered stuffed grape leaves and beef stroganoff ragu.  The grape leaves are meat stuffed and served hot with a rich yogurt sauce topped with fresh dill and parsley.  There was a wedge of lemon on the side.  A quick spritz of juice over the leaves really rounded out the plate.  The vibrant acidity cut through the richness of the yogurt nicely.    The stroganoff that came up next was also very rich.  It was a ground beef strognaoff in a full bodied sour cream sauce served over wild mushroom pelmeni (dumplings).  It was very good on its own but, in hindsight, the spice blend next to me would have been a fitting addition.   What meal is complete without dessert? I was considering the baklava but after hearing the Bulgarian Biscuit Cake described to me, I knew that was my dessert.  I was told it is made with a type of cake that cannot be found anywhere else in the valley.  And that it was layered with a cream filling like tiramisu, one of my favorite desserts.  How could I even think about passing this up?  I was surprised by the size of this cake.  It was bigger than I expected but not as rich I as thought it may be.  The cake used seemed more like a bread which helped to cut down the sweetness.  With the almost but not quite bitter dark chocolate sauce on top, it was balanced out to perfection and was the best possible way to end my meal.  I left with a soft smile on my face that only ended later when I was at home and the euphoria wore off.",

Low ambient music.   Service and food: servers were knowledgeable and and friendly.  The food was not what I expected . We tried the Hungarian meat platter: overall good, a dash but saltier, but good with bread.  Fries with garlic, herb and feta cheese: spectacular side dish that was just wanting for more. Dessert: biscuit was quite light and good. Paired perfectly with some black coffee.   Overall a good European tapas place, I wouldn't say so much on the Spanish side of dishes. But I'm happy with what this place has to offer.",

The location and the way the outside of this place looks, you never would really think of coming here, but this place is awesome. The outside seating area leads into a bodega type of shop where you can purchase super fresh meats, cheeses, bread, and alcohol. Next to the bodega looking shop is the seating are for the restaurant. My friends ordered for everyone, and I'm kind of glad they did. I couldn't make a decision about anything. Everything looked great. We started with crepes, creme, and caviar which we paired with rose' and mimosas (brunch bests). There was paella, octopus, sausage, a huge croissant roll looking thing, and bacon wrapped dates. Everything was so flavorful and we left feeling stuffed. The bacon wrapped dates and the crepes were my favorite. Amazing service too! Everyone was extremely kind and helpful. Hands down, great spot.",

I had to have them cook my Thracian Pot more because the egg was completely raw (I asked the waitress if it was supposed to be raw and she was like \"nope\" and took it back to the kitchen). A few tables were seated after us but they got their food before us even though we ordered the same things. Also, I saw a waiter drop his corkscrew, then he proceeded to pick it up off the floor and used it to open a bottle of wine! So that was pretty disgusting.

Today I had a light meal including their famous gypsy milk cocktail which is ultimately refreshing especially for this Las Vegas heat made with a huckleberry vodka and a secret gypsy juice   My meal today was a Thracian clay pot that was famously featured in one of my favorite shows drivers dine in dives. It is definitely something to look into.   The staff here are super friendly especially Jose. He was super outgoing and gave me all my great recommendations this being my first time.

Cuz the food is really good. I had great service as well. I would have given it more stars if the curb appeal wasn't so discouraging.",

    "text": "Forte is called \"Forte\" because that's exactly what their food is filled with - strength. They're a strong restaurant. To hold their fort down, outside of the restaurant are heavy-duty patio furnishings and a green metal gate with two different entrances. Just hop right in whichever side, left or right, and open the darkly tinted door.   A server, Robert, greeted us and told us to choose a seat anywhere. There were candles to light the dining room. There was one other group that we saw and they were chatting in Russian.   Apparently, the dining room is split in half and there are other dining tables further back and to the left side of the restaurant because the server went back there several times with food and drink.  I highly recommend trying the Selyodka, Adjarski Khachapurri, Thracian Cheese Clay Pot, and their Pelmeni Dumplings.  Selyodka: definitely fish and potatoes done right with some olive oil, dill and great pairing of flavors that really wow you  Adjarski Khachapurri: Refer to Frank W.'s review for a description. It's a great description. This one was delicious and the bread just sensational  Thracian Cheese Clay Pot: brimming with seasoning, but not overwhelming. So delicious  Pelmeni Dumplings: European jiaozi... mmm...  Very European vibe... food was excellent. I will definitely be back again!",

We ordered a bunch of plates, and were happy with almost all of them.  Favorites included the beef stroganoff rago (SO good) and the kahchapurri (wished I didn't have to share this one.)  The calamari relleno was good (I liked it more than my wife did though), and we both enjoyed the dates.  Finished the meal with an order of biscuit cake, which was a satisfying ending.  Make sure you aren't in a rush though - service was very friendly, but a bit on the slow side.  Overall, a very nice restaurant, and a place with a lot more on the menu that we'd like to come back and try.",

We arrive at 7:30 on Wed. night to be greeted with a smile and seated immediately with our reservation in a restaurant that was about half full.   First they bring out their homemade bread, to die for, with olive oil and Hungarian spices.  My wife and I are not big bread eaters, but this was sensational.  Like many others, I discovered them on triple D with Fieri.  So many things on the menu look great, but we went with the two highlighted on the show, the mixed grill and the Thracian clay pot.  If you are a pork lover ,this is your place!  All three items on the mixed Grill are prepared differently with unique taste and all were exceptional.  The clay pot with feta cheese, tomato peppers and more sliced pork covered with a baked egg was unbelievably good. The feta cheese took on a flavor I've never had and the tomato was cooked down to be cut with spoon but still have body and flavor.  We cleaned both plates.  At that point I asked for the check as we were trying to make a late show. In passing, my wife said it was my birthday. The hostess would not let us leave without boxing up a dessert to take with us. At no charge!  What an unexpected pleasure and it too was delicious later that night in our room!  You have to have an open mind for this is not your standard fare, but if you're willing to try something out of your comfort zone, it is well worth it!",

    "text": "Yep. Im another person who came here after seeing that episode of Triple D featuring our favorite, flame shirt wearing host, Guy Fieri. I had their dish that was a sample of different sausages. The plate was huge and the price was decent. Atmosphere is nice and its dimly lit. Service is nice with nothing major to complain about.  The food seems good based off the sausage sampler i got and they also have great bread. So with bread being served as a default, the place is going to be extremely filling. I never left a place that full that wasnt a buffet. Also their bread is amazing with that odd blend of spices and olive oil they offer.  Service is alright. My only complaint is water not being delivered as fast.  Atmosphere is nice and a bit divey. Dim lights are always nice and theres outdoor seating available if you dont like the inside or the weather is nice.  They serve water in hard liquor bottles which is humorous. The only draw back to this is the limited water youre able to get at a time.  Pros: good food at a decent price for it, complementary bread which is great and filling, nice sense if humor with the water.  Cons: water is limited at a time and it can take some time to get it replaced unless you just ask.  Advice: if youre still hungry after the main dish, just get more bread. Try to ask for 2 sets of water if you drink water that much or have a group of friends.",

I would have shelled out 2 stars on the food alone.

The drinks from the bar are A-OK as well.  I went a little safe with a Moscow Mule and I could enjoy one or two again sometime if I ever found myself here again.",

Started with bread dipped in olive oil mixed with wonderful spices (what is this called? Where can I buy more of these spices??). Friend tried the octopus appetizer, it was cooked perfectly and the bed of rice had a lovely flavor. Tried both the Bulgarian and Serbian mixed grill platters. Both were incredible, with uniquely spiced meats with unusual, but pleasing flavors. I don't know what the names of things were, or which platter was which, but it didn't matter, because everything was excellent. Even the side of \"ketchup\" which was wonderful on its own. The Bulgarian Biscuit cake was one of the best things I've ever eaten: soft layers of thin dough with cream in between. Even the Bulgarian house wine was outstanding. All this (and several other delicious drinks) for a very reasonable price. I can't wait for the next time I'm in town to eat here again!",

The nostalgia really sells it for me so perhaps my review is biased, but take it from my wife and the friends whom I've brought because they will also agree that the food is fantastic.  Service is good as are the prices.  Atmosphere is very inviting and lively. I'll be driving the 280 miles to see them again soon.",

I can't wait to go back again.... what a cool place and all the different food was awesome.

    "text": "Yes, I saw this on DDD.  Yes, I'm slightly embarrassed about that.  However, I'm more ashamed of the fact that this place is walking distance from my house, and it took my tragic Food Network addiction to draw my attention to it!  First things first...this place is pretty small.  There aren't a lot of tables, and the bar takes up much of the main entrance.  There is outdoor seating, but given that this is summertime in Vegas, and the restaurant faces westward, it's way too hot to sit out in the evening.    Second thing - if you, like me, are vertically challenged, I highly recommend getting a seat in the restaurant area.  My group had a table in the bar area at first, and the chair was so high I actually had trouble getting on and off.  Comfy once I was up there though!  Service wise...this place was fine.  Our waitress was nice enough, but it didn't seem like she got our group's sense of humor.  She was efficient, but not overly friendly.  It was pretty busy, but we got everything we ordered in a reasonable turnaround time, so I had no issues with service.  The drinks were awesome.  I had the gypsytini to start the night, and although it's a \"house secret\" blend that my waitress couldn't describe, what I ended up with was a vodka martini that was lightly tart and fruity.  Very refreshing and tasty.  Another friend had the Ginger Lemonade cocktail, and the addition of fresh herbs like rosemary gave it a wonderful flavor.  We ordered a pretty decent array of food for our group.  It's hard to mess up almond-stuffed bacon-wrapped dates, so those were a fab way to start the night.  I ordered the varenikis, and I was a big fan of the fried onion topping.  The dumplings themselves were slightly cold, but it seemed like that had more to do with the sour cream juice (sorry for the lack of a more appetizing descriptor) cooling them down on the plate.  My buddy who hates onions actually loved the onions on this dish.  I grew up with a mom and grandmother who made goulash on a regular basis, and Forte's version was almost on par with my preferred version.  The chorizo we ordered was pleasantly smoky, but not as spicy as I would have liked.  One of my less adventurous friends actually ordered the adjarski khachapurri, which is finished table side by the server, who breaks the egg yolk and stirs it around to made a sort of custard spread for the bread boat.  Although he wasn't sure about it at first bite, by the time we looked up we had eaten the whole thing!  It was addictive and delicious, so definitely try it out.  All told we had six people, five of us with at least a couple drinks, and we ended up with a total bill of about $100 including food.  Not a bad price, and we'll definitely hit up this hole-in-the-wall next time we want something a little off the beaten path.",

Small in size and kitsch in decor with heavy woods accented by posters, graffiti, and Christmas lights as American pop played overhead it was less than sixty-seconds after the final member of our party arrived that orders were requested and having twice deferred only to be given the first of two strainers of warm bread a somewhat rushed order was placed with a request for items to be appropriately paced - a concept that, along with beverage refills, proved as foreign as the food with the table soon overburdened and serviceware for sharing few and far between.  Opting for specials and staples from diverse regions including Spain, Greece, and nations of the former Soviet Union it was with oddly 'truffled' store-bought potato chips mixed with dry chorizo that our tasting began and rolling next into the duo of oily Chebureki and overcooked dates propped up by an outstanding sherry reduction it was with good fortune that the meal would soon improve, the tender whole squid restuffed with their tentacles and cooked in ink subtly sweet over aromatic rice.  Left precious seconds to digest and discuss a second wave of food soon smothered the table once more and finding far more success than round one both of the breads proved superlative with big flavor and a pleasant degree of grassy funk that I only wish had been present in the tender but flavorless lamb, a 'special' by title only and completely forgotten compared to the bombastic melange of meat, cheese, and vegetal aromatics contained in the clay pot.  At this point sated but happy to finish with something sweet, two-parts each of baklava and biscuit cake rounded out the afternoon with the former benefitted not by lemon nor liberally applied simple syrup while the latter proved exquisite; a delicate balance of crunch and cream with mild sweetness harkening tiramisu but dressed up with honey and nuts that were perhaps stolen from the baklava and used here to better effect.",

We weren't sure of exactly what tapas were. But when looking at the menu and reading the reviews, we knew this was a place to try. We were not disappointed! It was all delicious. My favorites were the stroganoff \" deliciousness\" and the Chorizo in Spanish Wine. My only regret is that we didn't allow near enough time for dinner. We had to be at another engagement and had only allowed ourselves 1 1/2hrs. This restaurant is designed to have many small meals, shared with friends and good company and to savor each dish, before the next one arrives. Our waitress was Amazing! My regrets that I don't remember her name. We are going to try and get there again before we leave! That's how good it is. You must try it!",

So far, I have tried the Adjarski Khachapuri, straganoff fries, vareniki, pelmeni & the biscuit cake.   I highly recommend Adjarski Khachapuri. I get this every single time. It is freshly baked bread with a pickled cheese & an egg in the middle. You're supposed to tear off a little piece of the bread & dip it in the egg. I've had this in many different restaurants. And, I really love theirs!  I really like their Mojitos too. The person I went with thought thought it had too much mint & lime. But, I thought it was perfect. Although, after you take a few sips, you can dilute it with water if you wish to do so.  Finally, I really recommend the biscuit cake. It's hard to describe it. It does resemble the Napoleon cake. If you ask me. The atmosphere is really nice too. And, they always play great music. Overall, I really love this place!",

There's no beer on draft....and soda comes in a bottle...and worst of it, the whole place smells of stale kitchen....the place is quirky, small and poorly ventilated and maybe I'm more sensitive than most, but I really hate that smell.  So why four stars- because I'm Russian and I know how painfully slow typical service is at any Russian restaurant. These guys are ON IT. Super friendly energetic team of two people that waited on us made it ok. They tended to each table together without missing a beat and were ever present, something you will NOT find at a typical Russian-ish establishment where waiters seat you and then leave you alone for what seems like hours on end so you can discuss pirogi and snow and s*** with your comrades.   The food though...if you are going to call things tapas, they need to be shareable....anything served on a bed of mashed potatoes is not. Now, I was there with my two kids, I had nobody to impress (my life is sad, yes), so we were fine licking our fingers and shlepping runny goulash back and forth, but I can't imagine bringing a date here. That said, some of the offerings were tasty. We ordered chicken kabob (meh), goulash (tasty!), stroganoff fries (definitely a fusion dish, albeit yummy), lamb chop lollipops (I didn't get to try any, my children love lamb so much and I try to be a decent \"you go ahead, I'm not hungry\" parent), and khachapuri. Oy, the khachapuri....again, I'm a spoiled Russian that used to vacation in Caucus mountains by the Black Sea, so I have had most heavenly and authentic Georgian khachapuri and chebureki on earth, but guys, work on that stiff, bland overwhelming thick dough. It killed the dish. The portion size,on the plus side,  was great to get the three of us full.  Again, I'm really torn. If you are Eastern European, you'll probably not like it. If you are not, you are likely to have a good time. You decide.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for this restaurant as the food looked great and reviews seemed promising. These hopes were killed slowly and painfully over two hours in what was easily one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. I'll start with the short list of positives.   Pros: 1. Nice decor - I liked the cheeses, meats, caviar, etc that were displayed as you walk in. The seating area was colorful but well decorated. The water comes in vodka bottles which is pretty neat and I really liked the rural and authentic plates and bowls.   2. Borscht- hearty with a flavorful beef based broth. Lots of beets with a nice amount of sour cream to go with every bite.   Cons: 1. Slow service - by slow I mean excruciatingly slow. Every thing we ordered or requested took between 10-60 minutes. This included water refills, extra utensils, the check, and worst culprit was the food. One person at our table of 4 ordered the borscht as a starter which took about 25 minutes. The rest of the food took almost a full hour to get to us from when we placed our order.  2. Salt food and service - we ordered both the Bulgarian and Serbian meat platters, as well as the beef stroganoff. All items, especially the meat platters, were EXTREMELY salty. I'm someone that doesn't mind aggressively seasoned food when I eat out, but the meat was so salty that it made us cringe to eat. We told our server and she said that that's just how they serve it and that she doesn't find it salty when she orders it. She made no offer to replace the dish or to remove it from the bill. We tried but couldn't finish the platters as they were just too salty. We spoke up about this to her multiple times and her solution was to give us a free small cake while still charging for the meat platters. When we received the check and saw the platters were on it we asked for them to be removed and she argued with us before finally relenting and removing one but not both. This is a sad excuse for customer service. This combined with the inedible food is enough to make me never return.   I highly advise you look elsewhere for great food and service.",

I had the Bulgarian mixed grill and the tapa item, Pan con tomate.  As I was waiting for the food I looked around and noted the restaurant is also a market.  Diners can buy wine and other popular Russian dry goods and packaged foods.   The menu has so many choices.   I'm eager to try the Russian style pork cutlet with pickle and the filet mignon.  The prices are phenomenally reasonable so I've got to come back here.   The Bulgarian mixed grill and the tomato bread was delicious.  And service was great!  I sat at the bar and got to converse with the proprietors of this family owned establishment, which is another good reason to come back because We've got to support small businesses.",

    "text": "It can be tough to find scratch cooking in this neighborhood let alone authentic European technique, product and flavors. That being said Look no further, I stopped in to Forte for lunch and the first smells were freshly baked bread and roasting garlic. Greeting was really warm and I was at table with water and a menu within moments. The menu is full of intriguing and pleasantly unfamiliar terms, I love to learn new preparations when the background is this authentic. Upon recommendation of the server I had a watermelon and finely grated feta (so creamy it actually melts on your palette) salad garnished with lemon, sesame and finely cut super fresh red onion. The moisture content, texture and brightness was really wonderful on a hot summer day. I also tried the shrimp and garlic loaded with herbs and butter & wine, great contrast to the salad. So many great things on the menu to try I wish my stomach was bigger. That being said I washed it down with a nice glass of Sauvignon Blanc and I was in and out in under 30min, service was friendly and right on time! Value was wonderful so I'll be back soon for sure. There is also a market component with charcuterie and cheeses, wine spices etc. product looks great, need to check that out when I have more time.",

So last week we went with a friend at opening time - 5:00 - & found it a real mess.  They have, since our last visit, thrown furniture together that doesn't add to the old Bohemian atmosphere we relished & now... see-thru plastic chairs & very cheap faux wood tables, with partitions that make it feel crowded & far from intimate.  About the same time we arrived, a duo was setting up their set for the nite, rearranging furniture, making noise like it was moving day, & we felt like maybe the food would make up for it all.  Because of the mess, it felt unclean, but our friend had his appetite set on  some of those sausages.  He had the platter of same, along with soup & claimed both were delicious.  My partner & I had the kebabs w/rice & they were also well seasoned & as we remembered.  Since there were only 6 of us in there, you'd expect some decent service, but alas!  Our server forgot our friend's drink & never refilled our water glasses on the stifling day.  We three decided against a return visit & wonder whatever happened to the old Forte & why?",

The dishes were all handmade pottery direct from Bulgaria! Amazing designs! Perhaps most importantly, our server, Nataliya, was delightful as she described the available dishes and drinks.   We started with Bulgarian liquor called Rakija. This clear drink certainly had a kick and was a great aperitif! We then moved on to the main courses. The prices were quite reasonable. For example, my Bulgarian mixed grill with three kinds of sausages was $11. In fact, we ordered three main courses so we could try the Thracian Clay Pot which we found intriguing. It's some tasty comfort food with a strong flavor profile and one hell-hot pepper hiding in the pot. Be careful!  Make sure you ask for their homemade bread. With olive oil and an incredible spice mix already on the table to mix in the oil and then use to dip the bread, it's a taste sensation.  I can't finish this review without mentioning the soundtrack playing over the speakers. It was an awesome deep house mix. When we unsuccessfully tried to identify it with Shazam, Nataliya informed us they are mixes from DJ Mascota from Sofia, Bulgaria! Bulgarian electronic dance music with Bulgarian liquor and food! We've since found DJ Mascota's music on SoundCloud and it does not disappoint! I think we'll have to head to Sofia to check out the music scene!",

    "text": "Forte has an incredibly extensive menu that ranges from Spanish tapas to Russian and Bulgarian specialties, but I'll get to the food later because the MOST UNIQUE part of this restaurant are the numerous house Infused Vodkas:   The \"Garden Vodka\" when used as a substitute for every ingredient in your Dirty Martini excluding dry vermouth, creates an Exceptionally tasty yet one of a kind Cocktail. And I'm not afraid to admit that I am definitely a cocktail snob ;D  There is raspberry infused vodka, potato infused vodka, various Grappas... The list goes on- you need to check this place out if only to discover the rest. In addition they have Banana Sambuca, and while it isn't infused in house it's definitely going to be a pleaser for adventurous types. The bar is very well stocked from recongnizable alchohol to imported beers and wine, and especially imported vodkas; So don't be afraid to get obscure, like small village in the Ukraine obscure.  Service- One thing I couldn't understand are the bad reviews preceding mine! You cannot come here expecting your service to be like The Olive Garden or some other heinous food chain. Forte is definitely an intimate atmosphere if you go early or on a weeknight. Thursday night is quietest. Because like most Eastern European bars/ casual restaurants they like to get a little rowdy with music! It's apart of the culture. They are having Jazz on Mondays though FYI. Service is personable and casual, and perfect for what it is.  The food is incredibly fresh and delicious. The egg boat had a name I won't even try to pronounce (see pictures), and is a dish I've never come across before. So happy I did! My favorites were the almond stuffed dates (Rich and Delightful) and the Feta Burek with its flaky delicate crust and creamy center- Mmmm. For dessert we had the biscuit cake which reminded us of Tiramisu at first glance, but had this incredibly soft texture and taste that did not resemble Tiramisu, and it was a sumptuous finish to a quite filling dinner. They have flavored cappuccinos as well!   If I had to sum up this place in a sentence it would be: Don't miss out!!",

To wash down this feast, we ordered small (who knew?) glasses of Zagorka beer that were flat.  My wife was unable to restrain herself so we closed out the meal with a biscuit cake (similar to tiramisu).

    "text": "I'm sorry but I have to retract my original review. My husband got food poisoning from their calamari. It was the only thing that we ordered that I didn't eat. I took a small bite but something in me told me I didn't like it. I have a good sense for food quality.   My husband agreed that it didn't taste like it was bad but the calamari was not hot enough and we think it wasn't stored at proper temperatures. I've been in the food business for years.  Although most of my orginal review was accurate outside of the calamari, I can't get past the fact that my husband was sick for two days because of them.   NEVER AGAIN.  There are toooooo many upscale restaurants in Vegas to waste time with places like this. They got lucky to land a small feature on the food network.",

I went in exclusively for the thracian clay pot but the waitress said it was little and not a full meal.  So I also ordered the Pelmini, which were lovely beef dumplings with dill.  DELICIOUS!  My husband got the Beef Stroganoff Ragu which was also ver delicious and my daughter got the Czar Burger.  It was a pork burger served on flatbread with French fries inside.  It was SOOOOO GOOD!  They served bread with olive oil and some kind of spice that sadly I have forgotten what it was called.  My Thracian Clay pot was amazing also.  Except it was VERY HOT -- temperature-wise.  It has a Serrano chili on top so if you can't handle chili, take it off.  The mixture of the tomatoes and peppers with the egg was magical.  The waitress was so nice and helpful, she explained everythng to us and was just great.  I only wish that the restaurant had a sister in Los Angeles.",

I wasn't eating much but the table bread was delicious they have some yummy spice combo you add to the olive oil that is really good flavor I've never had before. We had the clay pot with egg. Egg was over cooked and that kind of ruined it, but I've never had Bulgarian food so maybe it's supposed to be that way? Grape leaves were good delicious dill sauce. We can't remember the other dish we had so it wasn't very memorable. Very laid back vibe is what we liked most. The beer selection was interesting and you get a hobbit mug for them. Moscow mule was really good. They infuse their own vodka with ginger. Family friendly. Bought a bottle of wine to go it was disgusting.... From Spain. So don't get that.",

However, the food was definantly good, the spices were unique and not bland. The interior decor grows on you as you sit back and look at all the newspaper and media clippings on the wall...feels authentic and almost makes you feel like your in another time and place.  Service was good when we got service...however, i was surprised that they had one individual working the front (serving, ordering, hosting guests)...this caused some interesting service experience.   For me (im from eastern europe), the food was good enough to surpass all the negatives about this place...i would definantly come back.",

The mixed grill plate was very good too! There was a red sauce on the plate plus onions and cabbage, which all paired nicely with the sausages.  The two other items I tried that were amazing were he Russian meat dumplings (life changing-ly delicious) and the feta cheese phyllo dough pastry was so delicious!

Lisa R's terrific review finally persuaded us to check them out and we actually ran into her having dinner at one of the tables upfront!  It was fate :)  The vibe was really cool.  Definitely don't feel like you're in LV.  They had a one man band doing covers ranging from Depeche Mode to Nelly Furtado in a whole Casio keyboard meets karaoke with an eastern Europe flare that definitely enhanced the experience.  We surprisingly started with a complimentary order of the \"Marcona Almond Stuffed Dates\".  Apparently they made an extra plate by mistake and our waitress gave them to us on the house.  Most tapas joints execute a kind of stuffed date tapas well but the size of these dates were a lot bigger than normal and the jerez sherry reduction gave it a very unique flavor.  Thanks to the staff for that one.  Our favorite dish was the \"Calamares Rellenos en su Tinta\".  They were stuffed baby squids (squid in squid) that were marinated and served in their own ink on top of Spanish herb rice.  We were kind of surprised the squid was served cold but it actually worked with the hot rice.  100% getting a double order of this the next time since my lovely wife hogged most of it :P  The \"Thracian Clay Pot\" almost sounds like a nickname for a torture device in \"Game of Thrones\" but it was anything but that.  It's a Bulgarian specialty served piping hot served with veggies, sausage with a baked egg on top.  The broth was perfect for a chilly evening.  It defines comfort food.  Some might find the broth to be too sausagey but I was digging it.  We also had the \"Bulgarian Mixed Grill\" and both liked the kiufte best.  They could Americanize those babies and make them sliders! hahahaha   We couldn't get enough of their table spice and put it on everything including the olive oil we dipped their amazing bread in.  I asked the server what the blend of spices were and she rattled off a whole list of things in it.  It was so good that I bought a bottle of their home blended spice before we left.  Their $20 bottles of wine rocked too!",

I tried the sangria which was delicious if you prefer sangria that is not as sweet as some chain restaurants.  I loved it! It was the right amount of wine and fruit.  I also had the fries with feta cheese, the ham and cheese, and the bacon wrapped dates from the appetizer menu.  All of these items were delicious.  I wasn't sure that the feta and fries were going to work but they certainly did.  The bacon wrapped date was sweet but the meat flavor of the bacon really took the dish to a new level.    I ordered the beef stroganoff and my husband ordered the dumplings.  Both were so full of flavor.  I really liked that the portion sizes were not overwhelming so I was able to taste a good amount of the items on the menu.  My mother order the goulash which comes on a bed of mashed potatoes - I will definitely be ordering this next time.  My father ordered the beef and lamb for $14! He said both meats were perfectly prepared - this was the only dish I did not try as he was at the other end of the table! Beyond that the price for the quality of food you get cannot be beat!  The only thing that people should be aware of is that the place is eastern European food and in True European fashion it takes a long time to get the food.  I suggest definitely ordering appetizers prior to your entree as it may take a while to get the food.  If you are needing to get in and out for dinner I don't know that this the place for that.  But if you are looking to shoot the breeze with friends and have a good time drinking and having excellent food, then this is the place for you! SOOOOO Awesome.  Definitely a place I am putting in my regular rotation.",

    "text": "We went to lunch here after seeing on DDD - with Guy Fieri.  WORTH IT!  We ordered stuffed baby bells, Dolma, Clay Pot and a Bulgarian Mixed Grill plate.  They also served fresh bread, we had olive poil and a spice mixture out of this world.  EVERYTHING was completely amazing. It was like being in my grandmothers kitchen as a young girl.  Every dish was so yummy.    The sauce on the dolma and stuffed peppers complimented the flavors completely.    The mixed grill including bean salad and onion/potato salad was spot on.  The pepper sauce was perfect.  At the end the clay pot came out - it takes 20 minutes to cook.  OH M GEE!     The four dishes and two glasses of wine came to $60 - which is right what I expected to pay.   The surprise here - besides the food really being as spectacular toted on TV - was they have a full deli and market featuring a lot of meats, olives, dates from Eastern Europe.",

It's small, intimate and unique - all good qualities to spark conversation on a date. Also, all of the food is good for sharing and really delicious!  We tried so much that I can't even recall it all. I know that I loved the watermelon and feta salad and wasn't a big fan of the dates. Our flatbread was REALLY good, and so was the clay pot, although we expected it to be a bit larger than it was.  The service was fast and friendly and they have a good wine/cocktail list. If you're in the area and looking for something out of the ordinary, I definitely suggest giving Forte a try!",

The food is delicious, has a wide variety, and is pretty authentic.  Many of the people working there have an eastern European decent, so that is always a good sign to know you're getting a quality meal.  I came in during the 4-7pm daily Happy Hour and had a few drinks, the stuffed dates, and the chicken paprikash.  All was very good and unique to the area.  The menu consisted mostly of Bulgarian, Hungarian, and Russian cuisine, but also had some normal tapas selections as well.  The cocktails were tasty but a little light on the alcohol content.  Overall I really enjoyed my meal here.  The restaurant is pretty small but nice.  Happy Hour is the way to go for $5 cocktails and beers and then order your tapas or meals alongside.  I will be back in the future to sample some other dishes and experience other eastern European dishes.",

We ordered sangria, some beef dumpling thingy (pelmeni), the bread with cheese and egg in the middle, the thracian clay pot and stuffed dates. The pelmeni and cheesy-bread thing were kind of bland. The clay pot was flavorful, with yummy sausage, and I think I would get it again. The stuffed dates were the only food we ordered from the Spanish tapas side of the menu and they were good but almost overpoweringly sweet (Firefly's are better!).  Service was ok; sometimes it was hard to flag someone down when we needed something. My husband greatly enjoyed the propaganda posters in the bathroom.",

Ordered: Gambas al Ajillo (shrimp with garlic, wine, olive oil) Calamares Rellenos en su Tinta (marinate baby squid in ink over rice) Beef and Lamb Confit Vareniki (potato + onion dumplings) Adjarski Khachapurri (soft bread boat filled with cheese + egg) Tolumba (fried dough bathed in honey) Ginger Lemonade (like a gingery mojito with a hint of rosemary)  All the dishes were standard tapas portions (except that bread boat) and completely delicious. I'm lactose intolerant and not a big fan of meat. Despite that, there were still plenty of items for me, plus some mighty tasty drinks. I couldn't eat the Adjarski Khachapurri because of the cheese, but judging from the single crumb left by my bf, it was pretty good.  We sat outside at roomy, slightly wobbly tables. Ice water was brought without us asking, service was consistently good, as are prices. The only downer was the cigarette ash that was left on our table when the hostess took the ashtray away. Nobody came to clean it off so we shifted to the next table.  We'll definitely be back to try everything that we didn't get around to trying the first time.",

That can happen, but when we asked about the difference between the Serbian and the Bulgarian Grill (just because it was our first time there and we are not familiar with serbian or bulgarian food and the description on the menu was a different language)  the answer was \"it's just different sausages\" and then she rolled her eyes.

I tried the stroganoff and it was ok - not the best I've ever had but it wasn't bad.  Oh - and the rose nectar vodka - that stuff was good but man it packed a punch.    I tried some sort of dumpling thing (what April mentioned, I think) and it was *really* good.  I wish I had ordered one of those just for me.  I tried the bread side dish (the description was similar to bruschetta) but it was boring and overpriced.    That dessert plate the waitress brought with the pastries was excellent.  Those alone are reason to go back.    The decor is weird - it looks like a bunch of tables taken from peoples dining rooms.  And the artwork is really weird too.  Overall I liked this place.  Its laid back and has current music playing in the background.  If you're looking for upscale this is not the place to go.  If you're looking to hang out and have some good food its worth a try.",

    "text": "I've been to Forte three times now and have not had a bad experience.  Here's the deal though, going to Forte is a different cultural experience and is not going to be comfortable for people who are expecting an Americanized Eastern European restaurant.  What I like about this place is the great, very European vibe it has - pulled together, comfortable, eclectic, loungy.  This place is very versatile with an ample porch, a great bar (I will say the bar stools are not great.) and a dining room with a variety of tables.  The walls are covered with a variety of odd and, lets say, eclectic art that would make any hipster coffee shop proud.  I find the staff pleasant and helpful and always willing to give you a recommendation from a menu that is unfamiliar to most.  The food is very comfortable and, to my taste, good.  Things Americans will perhaps know include Beef Stroganoff, Kebabs, and Hungarian Goulash.  Things less familiar will be Plov, a dish of rice cooked with meat and carrots, and Katchapourri, a bread bowl with cheese and an egg.    The thing that gives this place the 4 stars, along with the atmosphere, is the bar.  On tap, they have Pilsner Urquell, Stella Artois, Sam Adams Seasonal, and Blue Moon for beers and a variety of Russian and others in bottle.  The bar is extensive and all is quality - I don't think I've seen a mid-range bar without plastic-bottled well liquors or even lower-end standards, such as Jim Beam and Wild Turkey.  Also, at Forte, they macerate a variety of fruits in vodka and brandy, and they are great!  I particularly like the Sour Cherry Vodka and the Gypsy Concentrate.  One final note is the pricing, which is great!  My last bill included two appetizers and two entrees, a draft, two double Knob Creeks, and four Sour Cherry Vodkas (full rocks glasses with ice) for a total with tip of $55.  As much as I love Herbs and Rye and Nora's, the same bill would have been doubled.  So, if you're interested in a really good, pretty authentic Eastern European bar/lounge/coffee shop/dining experience, go to Forte.",

Staff was helpful, the place was pretty empty so we got good attention. Alot of us started with a Rose nectar juice vodka, it was light, and strong. We all sucked those down. A few others got sangria or wine.  We got complimentary bread with oil and vinegar, the bread was great, airy and chewy, crisp on the outside. A  vegetarian friend got the Shopska Salad and she loved it, it was smothered in feta! We got the Mixed Charcuterie Plate, which was different salami, pepperonis and such. Not worth the price. The Marcona Almond Stuffed Dates, Wrapped In Bacon were Yummy with a capital Y! We tried the Adjarski Khachapurri upon recommendations of a fellow Yelper, The bread was hot, it magically cooked the raw egg before our eyes. Delicious! Beef Stroganoff over rice, I'm used to it with noodles but this version was okay, maybe a bit salty, but good. Pelmeni, beef dumpling, it was okay, the meat was very peppery, which turned me off, very doughy but done nicely. Blini W/Meat was good, a bit on the plain side. Vareniki with Potato, reminded me of a pierogi, which I grew up on, very good rendition. We dared to try the Stuffed Squid In Its Own Ink, it was good, tender, had a salty briney taste, I was pleasantly suprised. The owner was nice enough to throw in complimentary pastries at the end. They were light twisted puff pastries with red jelly inside sprinkled with powdered sugar. Thank You! They were perfect.  I'd love to go back and try something else, most of what I sampled I grew up eating(except the squid), so I felt right at home.",

Had the Spanish stew which was on special and INCREDIBLE. Had almond stuffed dates were good. The meat dumplings were okay but a bit bland. the prices are ridiculously good.  Go!",

Kind of funky interior, and definitely has a European feel to it  I spent some time with the menu and was a bit overwhelmed by all the dishes available  Finally ordered a few things, and while sitting at the bar ( keep in mind this is a non-gaming establishment )    I notice someone to my far left smoking and then after speaking with the waitress / bartender another guest starts smoking 2 seats down from me on the left.     I overhear the waitress / bartender say something to the effect of \"Smoking is ok at the bar\"  No actually its not OK,   you can't just make up you're own smoking policy.    Its disgusting and I refuse to eat anywhere that smoking is permitted - legally or otherwise  Before my food arrived I left  I will not be returning under any circumstances",

Both were delicious, but the portions were so small compared to the price (about $10+ a person).  For the ragu, I was expecting more than four raviolis on a bed of gravy.  Maybe some rice or bread?  The bulgarian mixed grill was much more substantial, but still left our stomachs rumbling.  The ambiance was a typical bar.  The area was dark and the music was loud.  With markets like Trader Joe's and Whole Foods selling more \"exotic\" foods, I can't say anything here was unusual or exceptional.",

Two servers and a bartender to wait on 7 tables.  Everyone was pleasant, but our server did not recommend anything even after we told him we had never been there before.    We ordered some of their craft cocktails. The scorch your palate margarita, the smokey old fashion and a grapefruit drink.  No one wants a habanero &*$^ing margarita that is so hot you can't taste your food.  The smokey drink had a great presentation, but did not taste good.  The grapefruit thing was too sweet, but the best of the bunch.  They are on the right path, but these just are not thought through.  They should sit at the bar at Other Mama and try everyone of their drinks to see how it's done.  The charcuterie plate  was ok and the feta was terrific.  The chicken kabob with rice and veg was ok, but the chicken was dry.  Also, had the Alsace flat bread that was very good.  The atmosphere was nice, maybe just a little too kitschy and not in a good way. Entering the restaurant through an abandoned unused outdoor patio is not welcoming either - clean it up a little.  Again, with some slight adjustments and some improved menu items, this place could be worth your hard earned $$$, but it needs some real improvement.",

Smaller space with eclectic decor that we both enjoyed. The food was very good. While we were told plates were all tapas size, they were on the generous side in terms of portions. The lentil soup was very good. The beef and lamb dish was excellent! The Bulgarian mixed grill was also very good with great seasoning. Service was friendly tho on the slow side...very European feel. Not an issue for a relaxed night out but don't go if on a tight time schedule. There was some live neat ethnic music that started up mid way thru our dinner. Worth a try!",

We had a group of 6 people and ordered the Bulgarian mix, the spicy shrimp, olive oil octopus, two types of breads, and dates!  Everyone seemed pretty please with their cocktails, I ordered the gypsy milk, fruity flavor sorta reminds you of skittles.  It has a weird taste I can't pinpoint, but I drank it all and would order it again if I didn't have more to try on their menu.  One of my friends got the lemonade which was pretty darn good!  I would probably get it next time for myself.  The dates were amazing, they wrap them in bacon and carefully glazed.  I didn't have any of the bread dishes, but everyone liked it, some liked the flatbread more than the cheese filled bread.  The spicy shrimp was good, but it left a bit more to be desired.  I was expecting a bigger kick out of them, and it comes in a soup, not a dry dish.  In case anyone is wondering. The potato's in the Bulgarian dish were good, I personally didn't like the beans that much, and the sausage was a bit salty.  I would have enjoyed it more if it wasn't as salty.  The second meat it came with was definitely my favorite!  Great flavoring, though I'm not sure what it was lol. We ordered the forte forte garlic and herbs fries, was not happy with those.  It was missing flavor and not that crispy. I like my fries extra crispy, if not at least a bit more flavoring.  They were bland to me and I didn't taste enough \"herbs\" and \"garlic\". We also ordered the octopus which was a disappointment, it was barely touched.  I only enjoyed certain pieces of the octopus.  The rice it came with was yummy.  Hard to describe how they cooked the octopus, it wasn't chewy, so it wasn't over cooked, but it wasn't under cooked either. Like I said most of us were not a big fan of it.   Pricing was fair, we spent about $170 here with most of us getting two cocktails for 6 ladies and a baby to share. They got a huge selection on their menu for food, I'm sure you will find something you'd like to try.",

This place is located inside the same shopping center as Lee's Liquor on Rainbow and Flamingo road. From the outside you can see they have a patio with outside seating. I imagine at night when it's a cooler temperature you can sit and enjoy an ice cold Bulgarian beer or sip on Gypsies milk ! ( my favorite drink on the menu) Walk inside and you'll have a feast for your eyes alone. The walls are covered in paintings and artwork and it has a very european feel. The colors and textures of the booths and tables are so bright and colorful. The lighting is dim and we were sat in a table in the back near the wall covered in leaves! The little details at this place were so special. They have small salt and pepper served in a decorative bowl with tiny spoons and the water pitcher is a repurposed vodka bottle. I thought that was so cute! There happy hour is from 5-7 I would recommend asking what's on happy hour. We ordered drinks and tapas. I would love to come back and try more dishes here very soon!",

She suggested food and made us some of the best Valentine's cocktails (Rose All Day & The Gentleman). We ordered the vareniki, stroganoff fries and kachapurri. Everything was delicious! The owner's artwork is awesome, too. I have nothing bad to say about this place. Let Ashley make you a drink! We might be going back tonight lol",

Come in around 6pm on a weekend to get the full vibe of this place and its piped world music.    They have great house bread served with olive oil and Bulgarian spices (yum), and we've tried most of the tapas, all good.  Our faves are the Spanish blue cheese (queso picon), the khachapurri (its a cross between bread and croissant with pickled cheese and a cracked egg), and you can try the chorizos as well (check out my food shots). My husband loves their Serbian burger... it's a tasty patty with buns, sour cream and diced cucumbers. If the place is packed, you have to be patient with the food service.    Our bill for bread, 7 tapas and 5 strong cocktails was $95, good for 3-4 people.  We will definitely frequent this joint, so happy it's in our area!",

Then the Rosemary garlic flatbread with mortadella. Then we shared this roll that looked like a cinnamon roll but it was filled with feta and sour cream on the side. All of the breads were very good. I liked this last dish, but with so much feta it was really salty. We finished with their signature dessert, a biscuit with layers Of mascarpone and chocolate sauce. It wasn't bad. It could have used something to give it a little crunchiness and the chocolate was regular Hershey's chocolate syrup.  They had a crepe dessert option which I would try the next time.",

    "text": "Thus far, I have had a great experience here, and then just an \"ok\" one.  The fist time I came here, it was perfect! My group of friends and I were seated in the back at a large table, food and drinks flowed. I ordered the Bangers and Mash dish. To put it simply, it was amazing. I really loved the flavor of the sausage, and the mashed potatoes were creamy and rich. I also got to try some of Vanessa N.'s Watermellon and Feta salad, which was also great. The drink of choice was the Moscow Mule, served in the classic copper mug. Also, I tried the Gypsy Milk. These too, super tasty and well balanced drinks. I really couldn't say anything negative after that initial experience.  Now... The second time was a bit different. I had recently seen Forte featured on TV, and wanted to try one of the dishes I had seen. This turned out to be the Thracian Clay Pot. I was so stoked to taste it, especially after not one, but two of my friends told me it would be delicious.  Honestly, it was just meh. I didn't think it tasted bad, but it's not something I would ever order again. Nothing about the dish really popped. It was... Dare I say?.... Kinda boring.   I will say that the drinks didn't disappoint. The mules again were great. And with that $5 happy hour price tag, they were even better. But I'm sorry, I gotta bring it up. There was some lady sitting at the bar while holding her dog in her lap. Really weird, and pretty unsanitary. And that dog really did not look like a service dog. As we left the restaurant, she and the dog were outside in the dark patio area and it started loudly barking at us. Umm, what? Luckily, I'm not scared of dogs (it was a small one), but what if I had been? Pretty much a turn off.  But David V. is spot on about the atmosphere. Very fun, lively and inviting. Still worth a visit.",

We asked the waiter and she said that kanika had 4 different beers and she brought us the one marked as 6 dollars, so she was charging us 6 instead of 4. I told her that the beer was advertised as 4, and she said yes but its actually 6.   even is 1 dollar or 2 dollars more than advertised.. is still fraud.. if they do this with beer I can not even start to imagine what they do when they cook  I am defensibly sharing my experience with all people to prevent this from happening again  Shameful  Las Vegas Local !",

The food was great! We tried a variety of items going full tapas style. The stroganoff fries (a special) were delish, the goulash was very flavorful, the clay pot was interesting and good but I probably wouldn't get it again because I'm not a big fan of cooked bell pepper, the Serbian sausage platter was excellent- the sausage was like nothing I've ever had, flavorful but mellow and wonderfully fresh! The quality of food was great!  Also thought I would mention the live music. I really appreciated the fact that it was loud enough to enjoy but I could still carry a conversation with friends and hear what they were saying. Everything has character here from the people to the dishes and glassware! I will definitely go back!",

But I do expect the staff to not look at me like I'm crazy when I walk in the door. I also prefer a server to not huff and walk away when I say I've never been here before.   I walked into this place and the bartender looked at me like I have 3 heads or something. I just finished work. I'm a real estate agent and just wanted a little happy hour before going home. I can assure you, I don't have 3 heads, and I don't go to bars looking like a crazy person. I'm not sure why they seemed so shocked I went in their establishment. Maybe they don't like single female customers? Maybe they expected me to speak Russian? Who knows.   The other bartender stuck a menu on my bar table and asked if I had been here before. I said no. She huffed and walked away. What is that??   I sat there for a minute, decided I prefer to spend my money and time at an establishment where I at least don't get looked at like I have boogers hanging out my nose or something. And walked out.   Bartender who gave me crazy eye asked if I didn't like the menu. Actually I was very interested in the menu. I just wasn't interested in the attitude.   Maybe they are having an off day.   The only people in the place at 5:30 were an old man who looked like he parks in that same chair all day everyday, and an older woman who strolled out of the bathroom with a sour look on her face, picked up a glass from the old guy's table, and walked outside without a word.   I too walked out without a word.",

Every single visit: -Octopus with olive oil (on a bed of spanish herb rice) -Biscuit cake (dessert)  Then I choose to mix it up with a few of the following items: -Stuffed grape leaves (just so good. try this!) -Thracian clay pot (order at the beginning b/c it takes about 20 min to bake) -Hungarian goulash (mashed potatoes will never be the same) -Beef and lamb confit -Bulgarian easter lamb (meat tastes gamey, but that's expected for lamb but just be aware!) -Beef stroganoff ragu (wow.. just wow) -Vareniki (crust is perfect) -Chicken shish kabob  COME HERE!

Well this isn't the place to go because at 12:30 on a Saturday the week Forte was reviewed and recommended in seven magazine, they were closed. No sign, no notice just a waitress behind locked doors trying her best to ignore us. So we went to a chain restaurant, one that we knew would honor their hours. Boo on you Forte boo on you.",

Great atmosphere and food came up very fast. Happy to report that all the changes since the last visit have only improved forte to a whole new level. I feel as if it's a place to go if you are in the industry after work, or even as a causal guest. There is something on the menu for everyone and, more importantly, something new for everyone to try. Giving 5 well deserved stars becuase the owner obviously cares about her guests, as she is always there to give a personal touch to the venue. The only thing that I would say that I commented on was the amount of staff working. Just seemed like too many, but maybe they had a party coming in or something. Happy Cooking/Eating!",

We arrived shortly after they opened at noon and were immediately seated.  The place is cozy and dim, which would have been more relaxing if the music had been softer and chill - they were piping in some loud house/techno/whatever it was.  We ordered the langos, of course, along with the Spanish breakfast and palachinka.  Everything was delicious and filling, however it took a really long time to get our food.  We were one of only three other tables there at the time but all of us had to wait over 30 minutes to even get some bread.  The server was very prompt and efficient so it seemed as though it was the fault of the kitchen, as though it simply wasn't prepared for opening hours.  Not a very good first impression, however we'll give Forte another try later since sometimes unfortunate things happen and we did appreciate the tastiness of the food.",

Anyway, the food was excellent, the service was solid and ambience was \"meh\".  The food is all home cooked, excellent flavors but smaller than usual portions.  If you're order the grilled lamb chops you need to order 2 dinners because each dinner provides only 2 chops; there should be 3-4 chops per dinner.  Chicken shish kabob was delicious, but again, only one small skewer with perhaps 6 small square pieces of chicken.  Goulash was good; braised lamb very good; skirt steak good.  The mixed meat grills, whether Serbian or Bulgarian are 100% pork and they will NOT substitute.  If you are a pork lover, enjoy; if not and you're looking for beef kabobs or beef  and lamb koftas, you must go somewhere else.  Too much pork on the menu. Flavor wise - all dishes were delicious but over priced for the portions.",

Atmosphere: Inside kind of looks like a bar/lounge.  Outside is a patio.  We sat inside as it's so hot out.  Unfortunately, on Fridays and Saturdays it turns into a 'club'.  Although the only people there were about 5 or 6 at the bar and our table of 6, the DJ still played the loudest, most irritating techno music throughout the whole meal.  We couldn't even talk to each other.  Food: Almost inedible!  I've had delicious mediterranean food before.  The food here was terrible.  The bread was hard.  My girlfriend called it poor man's bread.  We split the stuffed peppers and some garlic fries with herbs.  The fries were ok had they not been drenched in oil.  The peppers were so gross.  They had such a nasty flavor and were stuffed with some kind of mystery meat/rice mix.  It was all covered with a terrible white sauce with a weird dill flavor.  Our friend had a feta cheese stuffed pepper and it also had that nasty white sauce.  We ordered the tres quesos  pizza for the table and it was too cheesy and way too salty.  I prefer chuck e cheese over this!  Another one of our friends got the cheese in a clay pot and I can't even understand how that was edible.  It was hard chunky cheese and eggs with some veggies in there.  So gross.    At one point, I had to go to the bathroom because I thought I was going to throw up.  The loud music mixed with the disgusting tasting and smelling food just put me over the edge.    We will NEVER go back again!",

    "text": "First timers here. We went to Forte after seeing it on \"Dinners, Drivers, & Dives.\" The place was quite small but it had a quaint atmosphere.  It was also pretty packed for a Friday night. It took a long time to get seated and even longer to place an order, which is understandable.   We ordered the Bulgarian Mixed Grill, Calamares Rellanos En Su Tinta, Thracian Clay Pot (which our server addressed that it would take 20 minutes to make), and Baklava for dessert. The food was amazing. The mixed grill was an assortment of 3 types of sausages and pickled vegetables. The Calamares was squid with spanish fried rice. It was wonderful... but we never got the clay pot. It was 40 minutes after we placed our order. We had to flag down another server to let them know we never got the other half of our order and we'll just settle with the baklava. Our server said the clay pot never went through the system. I find that hard to believe considering one of the servers tried to serve the couple next to us who was seated around the same time as us the same clay pot (which they got earlier) and then the server went back. Thankfully, we weren't charged for the claypot and the baklava was comped.   This sort of deterred our dining experience but we'll gladly eat here again, just not soon.",

We had an excellent lunch and we left an 18 percent tip. When we received the charge on our credit card, 52 cents was added to the tip. I generally tip up to the dollar, so it was not an addition mistake. I called the restaurant twice and asked for the manager to return my call. None was forthcoming. The restaurant experience goes beyond the food, and if a restaurant can condone adding money on to a tip and the management can't give a customer a return call, it doesn't deserve my business.",

    "text": "Went here with friends largely due to the DDD appearance.  Overall, we were very pleased.  We ordered damn near everything on the menu and did not have anything we did not like.  The mix of the spanish and eastern european actually works pretty well, and all the dishes we had were pretty well executed.    From the outside, the place really is just a tiny little dive bar looking place, with some \"drink, eat, play\" style casino/bar type message on the outside.  Inside, it is a little bar, with a dining area next to it.  Incidentally, our friends found out they did not have any high chairs, which was a little odd, but we did just fine.    They gave us some bread which was good and soft, and we ordered about 9-10 dishes, which were varying levels of good to great and also of value.  The tomato bread was tasty, as it came on a very soft baguette, and was decent at about $4.50.  The garlic shrimp were fine, but at $7 for 5 pretty small little shrimp, it was a bit pricey.  We also had the clay pot, which was good, but nothing that blew me away.  Also very good was the mixed grill, which we got 2 of, and came with a tasty bean salad and 3 pieces of grilled sausages.   I found them to be delicious, although they were very salty, so someone who does not care for that would not like them as much.  We had several other dishes, all of which were good.  Overall, for the 4 of us, with tax and 2 desserts, the meal was around $97, which was good considering we ordered a very healthy amount of food.  Definitely good, and the service was friendly and fast enough, although there were only a few other tables occupied.",

    "text": "5 Stars on Food. -- come here when its empty for a great meal. 2 Stars on Service -- if its crowded, or a line in front of you, walk away and come back another day.  Being of Eastern European descent, I'll try anyplace that serves borscht, sausage and pirogi, no matter what their language calls it.  We saw Forte on DDD and their Thracian Pot and Mixed Grill platters were a calling to enjoy.  Ate here on a Saturday night.  Their website suggests reservations which, if you want service, I'd recommend.  There were seven of us and we each ordered different plates, all cooked so well.  Everything was perfectly seasoned.  I think Forte put \"Tapas\" in their name because this place serves your food like its in Europe, which means that your food comes to the table as its prepared -- its not like in the US where every order comes at the same time.  We had some main dishes before appetizers but most all of it came out promptly and we were all allowed to share each others plates.  The Borscht was basic and tasty.  Like at a food court in Moscow. The dolmas were great -- it reminded me that we haven't made any since our grape leaf sister-in-law ripped out her plant. The lamb and beef confit were great. Ask for a carafe of water at the table because service is slow when it gets crowded. Feta fries were excellent.  Made us think of the last place that we loved feta fries and we still can't remember its name. The Thracian Pot was excellent The pirogies, although they're called something else in Cyrillic, were great. The stuffed meat deep fried turnovers were okay -- could use some more meat in them.  The meat was seasoned and tasty, just could use a little more meat. The Beef Stroganoff was very very good.  Its something I'll try to recreate at home.  Their sauce was so intense in flavor.  I'll get this again.  I can't think of anything that we didn't enjoy eating.  Unfortunately, they have some problems -- it appears no one want to be a server.  We watched as table after table of people would just get up and walk away -- leave.  They would be seated, and after about 15 minutes of not being waited on, just leave.  All the while, 3 people are behind the bar just hanging out, pouring some drinks but hanging out.  Maybe the waitress's called in sick that day, but I counted about 16 people get up and leave.  That's money walking and never coming back.  I also saw the people next to us sit for a good 30 minutes before being waited on, and then 10 minutes later for some bread, a draft beer and a soda.   Its quite sad because the food is great, but the staff is scaring away the income. By the way, after everybody in our party of 7 were fed and full, I was still waiting for my mixed grill.  It was about the time where I was deciding whether to just stop by a fast-food on the way home or put out the wait that our server asked if we wanted anything else.  I told her I hadn't had my plate yet.  Another 15 minutes later, it came.  Great plate - 3 kinds of sausage, some cold white bean salad that's not slimy or vinegary, and a red pepper/tomato whip -- I forget the name.  The sausages are all great to try as each has their own flavor and texture.  I was glad I waited.    Next time I'm here, I'm going for the Stroganoff, probably the Borscht again, and perhaps something else.  If I don't have a waitress next time, I'm just ordering at the bar like in Europe.  maybe that's the gig.",

    "text": "On the whole, this restaurant does give a new patron a great slice of  European cuisine and it is worth noting that if you've never been here before that you should try it out because most of the food as it is now is delicious, but having been here in the past and knowing what these foods really were has really soured my experience.  It's been a long time since I had been back to this place since its first inception. Back then this place was one of the only occupied storefronts in a dead strip mall. This place had a menu that was meat and cheese heavy and showcased a wide assortment of Eastern Bloc varieties.  The appeal of this place in addition to the great food was the tell tale sign of a great hole in the wall joint: Authentic European food, sketchy European groups of men and women engaging in non-English conversation and a woman running the show who knew what was good and made sure you ate it.  The most notable things were:  Shopska salad -It has the creamiest Bulgarian feta cheese. Don't mistake this feta for Greek feta. This is incredible.  Cevape -Homemade fat finger sized sausages served with lepina, a type of yeasty flatbread.  Artisian Charcuterie Plate/Cheese Plate -These 2 are definite musts for light eating and drinks  Leskovacka pljeskavica -similar to the cevape in flavor but served like an over sized burger  There were also a few kabob-like meats and a few other sausages similar to the cevape that were so delicious.  So why the poor rating? Mostly due to the fact that what I described is what I was hoping to find on this most recent visit today.  Our waiter informed us that he was brand new and didn't know much of the menu or the wine selection. He also pointed out on each trip back to our table that nobody was assisting him as he was learning. I'll point out here that for whatever reason he was not our waiter by the end of our meal.  We got the Beef Stroganoff Ragu, Thracian Clay Pot, Chicken Soup, Chebureki, Bacon wrapped dates and the Beef and Lamb Confit. We were really interested in the Thracian Clay Pot as it was recently featured on a Food Network show.  The Stroganoff was ladled over wild mushroom plemeni, a kind of Russian tortellini. This stroganoff had a lot of creamy goodness but was completely lacking the meat.  I'll get to the Thracian Clay Pot shortly. The Chicken Soup was desired by my kids ages 8 and 6, as well as the bacon wrapped dates. The chicken soup was quite chunky with big chicken flavor. The first round of dates looked like they spent about 1 minute too long in the pan where one side was cooked good the other burnt. We were informed that the cook likes to cook it that way to which our reply was, \"Please give us unburned bacon wrapped dates.\" They were very good about getting this order back after the rest of our items had come out.  The Chebureki was akin to a samosa where it is a flattened dough item filled with something and deep fried in this case, a delicious meat filling and topped with some dill and chopped scallions. Fairly standard in flavor and not served with any type of dipping sauce.  The Beef and Lamb Confit was tender and tasty served atop a small scoop of a dill and scallion rice. While this was tasty it was not a distinct one. My son said, \"Is this corned beef?\" And you know what? He was right. It did taste a lot like the type of corned beef I'd find in a chunky hash at Hash House a go-go. But that's for another review.  So now back to the Thracian Clay Pot. It would seem that during the shuffling of waiters for our table, either our waiter put in this order incorrectly or it was given to another table because we didn't get it during the course of them bringing the rest of our order. When we questioned why the long wait, we were told that it takes a while. We didn't get it after an hour after initially ordering and 30 minutes after reordering it. So I can't tell you how melty and delicious it looked and how it would taste, but the table next to us seemed to really enjoy it.  I'm not a vodka drinker so please read the other ratings for their extensive vodka menu.  This still doesn't really warrant the low rating based on the food. Where it really lacked was the overall experience now versus where it was. This place used to have people who knew the food, wasn't afraid to give locals some food they couldn't pronounce and keep True to themselves. Now, there are waitstaff that don't know the product and don't make you feel excited about their food.  If your looking for something new in Vegas and haven't been, your experience will most likely be 4-5 stars. It is not something that you will find anywhere else and that makes it unique. You will not have the displeasure of seeing a restaurant jump the shark.",

The olives were just right and a great mix of green and black- be careful because they're topped with whole green peppers that I thought would be like the olives but they're freaking spicy ass peppers!

A musician was softly playing a variety of songs, mostly 80s and soft-rock hits.   I started with the Ginger Lemonade, which I thought was great.

I'm not super familiar with Eastern European food, and having eaten it, I don't think that it will be my favorite cuisine, but I'm glad that I had an opportunity to try it.  I enjoyed the bread stuffed with cheese and topped with egg (it really does cook in front of you!) as well as the potato dumplings.   It is definitely an \"off the beaten path\" type of restaurant, and something different in Las Vegas. Worth a look if you're in the neighborhood and want to try European foods.",

    "text": "Our friends are regulars at Forte and we joined them for dinner. On previous visits they have always had a wonderful experience. Also the Yelp reviews are positive and the visit by Diners Drive Ins and Dives was excellent. Our visit was on Saturday July 20th. The place was nearly full and included a large group celebrating a birthday. The dining room has an Old World comfortable feeling and the wait staff is friendly and helpful. Service was excellent up to the up to the point of placing our dinner order.  Items ordered were Chicken Salad, Stuffed Grape Leaves, Hungarian Goulash and Thracian Clay Pot. While waiting, a glance around the room reveled that very few tables were receiving their food. Our server apologized for the wait and told us that our dinners would be out shortly and the entire meal with cocktails would be complementary.  We waited one hour for our food.  The Stuffed Grape Leaves were appetizers however we received something else and it was returned and replaced with the correct item. Several other items were not up to our satisfaction. The Hungarian Goulash was over salted and the dish was refused. The Thracian Clay Pot was heavy on the cheese and light on sausage. It did not look like the one made on the Diners Drive Ins and Dives show. There must have been something seriously wrong in the kitchen on the night of our visit. I hope this was an isolated situation that the owners of this authentic European restaurant can correct.  We would like the mom & pop places to survive.",

Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. The only thing keeping it from five stars is a bit of slow drink delivery but fret not even the cocktails are excellent.

My boyfriend and I came here last week for date night around 6 pm, and half of the restaurant was being used for a private event and the other half was very full. The man who greeted us said they had reservations all through the night and wouldn't be able to accommodate us. After standing there for a few more seconds looking around and kind of bummed, he asked if we would mind sitting super close to the door in front of the deli area if he brought in a table and chairs from outside. We jumped at the opportunity since we have been wanting to come here for a while.   The servers were so attentive, patient and seemed genuinely happy to be helping/talking to us. We started with the stroganoff fries and the sauteed shrimp- both amazing. Then we got the cheese baked in bread and a traditional meat plate that was featured on the food channel. Everything was incredible. I look forward to coming back here. Also- there was live music which was so fun and added a great touch.",

When I first moved here, I flagged Forte on my list of places I'd like to try because it was featured in an article featuring great lunches under $10.   Flash forward five years later...  Yes, five years.  Yes, I know that's a long time.   Yes, I'm kicking myself.   To my credit, I went back a week later. Twice in two weeks. So there.   Anyway, despite being it the same plaza as La Bonita Market, it's situated far enough away to allow for easy parking.   Reservations can be made. I'm not sure if they're needed since both of my visits to date were rather early in the evening. In any case, should you arrive and find yourself waiting for a table, the waiting area rolls into a market and small bar.   Seating is comfortable. There are mostly 4-tops in the uniquely decorated dining room. To no one's surprise, the walls are covered with Spanish and Eastern European decor.   The menu provides a wide range of selections; I can't imagine there wouldn't be something for everyone here. All of the items were well prepared and, while I enjoyed some items more than others, there wasn't anything I truly disliked.   Notable items:   - Ajarski Khachapuri. Two kinds of cheese oven-baked into a crusty loaf with an egg stirred in upon its arrival to one's table. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this, unless you have celiac disease, are lactose-intolerant (or both), or hate the little things in life that make people happy. It's worth a trip here for this alone, paired with beers or a few ice-cold adult beverages.    - Octopus in olive oil. Can't go wrong when all of the components are of good quality.  - Stroganoff fries. This is more of a notable item because of its novelty. If it hurts your heart too much, you can order fries and stroganoff as separate dishes. But, come on, live a little, friends.   - Biscuit cake. Do I really need to attempt a compelling argument for dessert?  - KBG martini. Pickled martini. With the Khachapuri. Just yes.   There is happy hour 5pm - 7pm, Paella on Saturdays, and a brunch menu I assume on weekends.  I'll definitely be back and it won't take five years...",

I get that some people don't get this place, those that are used to a corporate chain, but look, it's European style that means not only the good but service too. Can the food take a bit longer, yes because it's made to order people you want that! I try to come here minimum 2 times a month, I love everything from the bread to the salads to the meals! Food is priced lower then it should be so get in before they realize this!  The sausage combo with beans and pepper relish! This place is a chefs dream come True! The flavors are deep",

Our server was tentative and the place has interesting decor. We got a bunch of dishes together and shared it amongst each other. So many choices... Want... Everything...  Drinks: angry ginger lemonade, all the girls ordered their share of alcohol but I still enjoyed my drink the most so I got two! It has the taste of mule but it was YUMMY! You must like ginger. I believe Gypsy Milk was a close second.  Dates: I love dates and this was alright. it wasn't my favorite dish but would I order again? YES! Gets the cravings away.   Forte Fries: such a simple yet delicious item. We got the one without the feta cheese. That dill on top was a nice herbal seasoning and it balances out the heaviness of fries. GOOD. GET IT.  Octopus in Olive Oil: lots of olive oil in it. Wasn't a fan of the octopus dish but the rice with it was good.   Shrimp: We got the shrimp but I didn't eat any of it. I was too lazy to ask or reach for it. Silly reason right? It is pictured.  Bulgarian Mix: All the sausages and meats had excellent flavor. However, they were too salty for me. I wasn't a fan of this.   Margarita Flat Bread: BOMB. I love margarita pizza and I always want to try it if I see it on the menu. The crust was nice n crispy. nice freshness from that basil and tomato with that crispy crusty goodness!  Feta Cheese roll: This is not pictured. But I think this bread was amazing!!! I couldn't stop eating it even after being full. They have a side of sour cream with it. I feel like the bread's texture was similar to the margarita flat bread. love, love, love!",

    "text": "I am unfamiliar with European cuisine so I was definitely in for a treat when I visited Forte!   I first experienced this wonderful restaurant with one of MGM's executive chefs. He is a die hard foodie so I trusted his recommendation and was excited to explore a new type of food. We went with another friend and shared a variety of dishes and tapas:   - Stuffed Baby Squid My favorite dish. Glazed/marinated in its own ink and served on a bed of herb rice. The squid came out room temperature but the rice was nice and warm! I would not recommend for picky eaters - only if you want to try something unique and are a fan of octopus/squid. I recall the texture being soft and not very chewy like squid can tend to be   - Braised lamb Tender lamb was paired with a light salad and mashed potatoes. The lamb was very flavorful/incredibly soft!  - Stroganoff Fries  Delicious fries topped with beef stroganoff. So. Addicting. It was a great plate to share and the stroganoff ragu was excellently seasoned!  - Bread Boat Freshly baked bread filled with tasty cheese, topped with a delicious egg that's cooked right into the top/middle of the bread. We heard this was a staple/must try and were not disappointed! We broke the egg into the bread and very much enjoyed this as an appetizer   - Meat Grill Platter A smorgasbord of meats served with a side of fries and white rice. The sausages were extremely salty (for someone who loves sodium) but it was neat to be able to taste various traditional European meats  I ordered the Ghost Rider IPA and our server brought out the glass bottle of beer with a sweet clay mug designed with Aztec patterns. I may or may not have been overly excited about how cool this mug looked.     I remember the service being fantastic which only added to our awesome experience trying new dishes. I have not been back since my original visit but would definitely go back - most likely with someone familiar with the menu!",

    "text": "Forte is one of our fave Eastern European dining spots. Plunk right in the middle of an unassuming Bonito/Lee's strip mall, this mostly Bulgarian staffed deli/dinnery (yes I just made up a word), is easy to miss as you drive by on Rainbow Bl.  The decor is shabby-chic with a mish-mash of furniture, wall hangings, flooring and just plain random stuff everywhere. It works.  The food: ahhhh, the food. I had \"Bulgarian Easter Lamb\" (pic). Braised lamb chunks pressed into a tuna-can shaped mold. Accompanied by arugula mashed potatoes, a yummy and very creative spring salad and some rich reduction au jus.  I also had hot borscht (beef based with spud cubes, carrots and of course cabbage ... very savory). Now keep in mind this is not the Russian/Jewish style borscht with sugar, raisins and that distinctive sour salt tang. But oh so hearty and quite grounding.  My consort dined on Shopska (pic), a chopped salad with rustic-cut Persian cukes, tomatoes, green onions and canned Ortega chillis ... all tossed in a subtle herb vinaigrette. She also had a thick and tasty lentil soup, and a rich filo dough roll the size of a danish filled with Russian feta cheese.  The last pic is my Russian vodke  It comes in a mini Russian oil can. Quite smooth. It's called \"Neft\", which means motor oil   If you find yourself on the West side, please check Forte out! 5-stars all the way. Oh, and our server was bubbly and fun ... yay!",

    "text": "Forte is one of our staples, we seen to always go there when we can't agree on where to eat, and it never disappoints. I've eaten here as both a vegetarian and as an omnivore, and never had a problem having a great meal.   We almost always order too much and leave here stuffed. Some of our favorites are the stuffed sweet peppers, the bacon wrapped dates, sofiska baniza, the goulash, and the shopska salad. My husband loves the lamb lollipops, and on this recent visit, I tried a new salad on the menu, with Persian cucumber and sliced radish--so flavorful!  I've always had stellar service here, last night the server accidentally put in an order of the sweet peppers instead of the stuffed grape leaves, but they gave us the peppers too, on the house.   I love the pottery and eclectic art, it's always very lively feeling.   The only reason i wouldn't give it 5 stars is the awkward seating. They swapped out several tables for high tops, and being short and stout, it's awkward for me to hip up there on my stubby little legs. The low tops are two round tables put together, which looks cute but can be problematic when you order several dishes. The last time we sat on the low top benches, they sunk down quite a bit, but those may have have been replaced when they redid the seating arrangement.  Local or visiting from out of town, Forte provides a unique dining experience, with delicious food and friendly, helpful service.  Be sure to check out their cocktail menu too - I love their sangria. Happy hour pricing looks great!",

Server was Niko, he said, \"No problem, I'm paid by the hour.\" Alright, that's a good start!  I chose to sit outdoor. Thankfully the parking lot in the strip mall on that corner was not busy.  Pan con tomato with jamon has 2 slices of bread. The tomato was not in tiny cubes but more like a thin paste. Only 4 pieces of stuffed dates on a large plate so overall given the price, this was not a restaurant I would return to.  I wasn't sure if it was sarcasm from Niko with my 18% tip. Whatever!",

    "text": "We checked this place out after seeing it on Diners Drive Ins and Dives. The reviews were good, it was down the street and my parents were visiting so free babysitting! We started off with a couple house beers which were very good. The bread they brought out was good but the oil and herbs to dip it in were amazing!!  We ordered one of the items we saw on the show which was also very good. Then had some meat dumplings which were excellent but the little trimmings on top really made it unique. We would go back for all of it but the just like dessert stuffed, bacon wrapped dates were out of this world!! The food was fresh and hot. The staff nice and friendly. Its a great place to just enjoy your meal, not be bothered too much and it's inexpensive. Smaller restaurant so would probably be fun to go with a couple other friends and just linger over dinner.  2 beers, bread, dates, meat dumplings and meat plate was only $36. We would definitely go back and bring friends.",

    "text": "The gf and I finally hit Forte - it's relatively close to our house ( about 2 miles ) but just now made it to the top of the \"new try\" list.  Went on a Tuesday night and the place had a decent crowd.  Quirky looking place and kinda strange lay-out of the tables but ok by us.  Servers were pleasant and attentive.  The gf was really focused on one of the servers hair style, \" Should I get my hair like that?\"  - must have asked me 4 times, hey !  I'm here to eat, not look at hair !  We avoided liquor since it was a weekday.  They provided a mini-loave of bread with olive oil and they recommended you add a special Bulgarian seasoning mix to the oil - the gf loved it - I also liked it though I felt she added to much of the herb mixture to the oil.  We ordered:  Beef Stroganoff Ragu ( $8 ) - Holy cow, the ragu was perfect !  the pasta shells were like little cups to hold the ragu - also very good but we wish they gave us more !  Chebureki ( $3.50 ) -two beef filled fried dumplings - basically a turnover.  perfectly fried, nice flaky crust, a little light on filling but what do you want for $3.50 ??  Bulgarian Mixed grill ( $10 ) - pork grilled three ways - two are sausage, one a patty.  Different seasoning and texture on all three .  came with a side of white beans and a salad similar to cole slaw but better - overall, an excellent plate of food !  Stuffed grape leaves( $5) - each one had a sausage in it.  I enjoyed but the gf prefers the middle eastern version that includes rice.  I wanted to avoid the sweets but I was being hounded so we ordered the rice pudding( I believe $4 ) and the biscuit cake ( $5).  The biscuit cake was very good - reminded us of tiramisu but the liquor flavor is lighter.  I'm not a rice pudding fan but I liked the generous amount of cinnamon on top of the pudding that gave it a nice kick.  a few pics attached  we'll definitely return",

We ordered a bunch of tapas all of which were so salty it was hard to eat. The mash potatoes was nothing but a salt lick.   THE SERVICE 3 stars Our waitress was friendly and was kind but one person  in our party did not get her meal until the end. All that was okay but the worse part was yet to come.   THE SAFETY  ZERO Stars There is a step down in the restaurant that is invisible to someone walking towards the door. As a result one of my friends fell hard and landed on her hip on the floor. We went to  help her and knew that she was badly injured. Another patron called 911 and we stayed with her while she was on the floor.   I asked to see the manager and a woman said she was the owner. Her first words to me were ,\"there is a reason why we put signs there.\" She said it so coldly that I could not believe she was only concerned about her liability and not my friends welfare. I was expecting \"Is your friend okay? Im so sorry she is hurt. How can I help?\"  My friend lay there immobile and in severe pain while the whole restaurant acted as though nothing happened.  The ambulance came and my friend was rolled out of the restaurant in a gurney while the owner took pictures of her sign and another woman grinned   The result a broken hip requiring emergency surgery all because of a dangerous step down!   Absolutely negative experience and I'd never recommend this restaurant to anyone!   I'll never return.",

And the reviews were right - great place, great service, and great food!  To start, we booked a show for 9:30pm, and because we were running totally late, we didn't arrive at Forte until 8:20pm...yikes!  We told our waiter the story and they were more than accommodating.  Without even looking at the menu, we just asked for their top 5 dishes, enough to feed the four of us.  Within minutes, we had a great Spanish wine and our dishes started arriving!  FABULOUS SERVICE!    Now to the best part - the food.  Seriously, their meals live up to the reviews.  We had the stuffed grape leaves, Forte fries, Varenki, Bulgarian mixed grill, and the lamb.  We are a mixed group hailing from Eastern Europe and Spain...so we know our cultural food.  We were incredibly happy with the taste, presentation, and variety.  Their food is so tasty that you will think about it the next day and you will be asking yourself, \"When can I go back again?\"  Definitely worth the short drive off the strip!",

It was tough finding a unique place to eat.  We wanted something different.  Then we saw Forte European Tapas Bar and Bistro - off the strip.  We were purposely looking for off the strip place to eat.    First of all, we love tapas.  But we have never had Bulgarian food before.  So we were really pleased to find this.  The food though is superb.  We ordered a few items including:  Bulgarian mixed grill, octopus in olive oil, marcona almond stuffed dates with bacon, Bulgarian stuffed sweet peppers, and kachapurri which is like a boat shaped flat bread.  All of the items we ordered including the bread were all so good.  My favorite of the night is the almond stuffed dates wrapped in bacon.  I am glad that we veered off the usual places to eat in Vegas.    This is worth the drive from the strip.  Staff are friendly and informative.  Will go back here when in Vegas.",

The location looks a bit sketch from the outside being in a strip mall, but inside it looks like something that belongs in downtown Vegas. It's beautifully decorated and fun.   For food we tried a variety of things. My favorites were the Kachapurri, Margarita Forte, and the Varenki. The Kachapurri is definitely a must order. It's a large bread boat with an egg in the middle and cheese cooked inside. It's huge so I recommend sharing it with a few others. The margarita flatbread used the same type of bread and was topped with melted cheese, tomato and basil. I asked for a side of balsamic dressing to drizzle on the top for a little extra flavor, very tasty. The Varenki were similar to Pierogis, stuffed with potatoes and topping with onions.   As for drinks we shared some sangria to start. It wasn't overly sweet & was a great price point for sharing. I also tried the mysterious Gypsy Milk cocktail. It was similar to a Moscow Mule and featured the family's secret gypsy recipe.   I really enjoyed this place overall and would come back again. I recommend ordering less than you think you want since the portions are very generous. I do wish they had a happy hour with smaller portion dishes or drink specials.",

Service: just the fact that they served cold pilav before borsch tells all you need to know.  I am sorry, but Vegas has a lot more to offer, I will definitely pass next time.",

    "text": "Have you ever wanted to eat something different? Food you really can't get anywhere else? If the answers to those questions are \"yes\" then ooh wee do I have a recommendation for you. Located in yet ANOTHER Vegas shopping center, Forte Tapas will transport you to Eastern Europe...in a good way.   For appetizer we went with a cheese/charcuterie board and the Khachapurri (which I really wanted cuz Yelp photos). The board had a nice variety of cheeses and cold cuts. It was good but my God, the Khachapurri was UNREAL. Fresh baked bread with melting cheeses and an egg cooking on top while it's brought to the table. I could have just ate that for dinner and been good. If you come here, get that. You will not regret it. For dinner I had the Serbian Mixed Grill which included a variety of sausages and fresh cut fries. This was absolutely the correct choice. Each of the sausages was unique and had that delicious grilled flavor. Just don't ask me to pronounce them.  Service was very friendly and attentive. The restaurant is brightly decorated and the music took me back to my days in Europe. There isn't a lot of seating so maybe call ahead during busy time. Overall Forte was an awesome culinary experience. One I'll definitely revisit when I come back to Vegas!",

The Pelmini were so delicious and flavorful- A must try!  My husband had the goulash, I had many goulash while visiting Hungary and I must say that the one they served us was one of the best I ate. We just wished that the portion would have been bigger and had more meat.  I had the delicious Chicken Kebab which was also really good, really loved the flavorful rice that came with it.  Definitely a favorite of mine in Las Vegas.  The restaurant has a very quirky atmosphere. They sale various product from around the work and have an extensive wine list.",

Don't be afraid, try it (I mean I'm sure they are closed sometimes but it's worth getting out and trying to see if the door opens!).  Love everything I've had here.  It was on DDD for the meat/kabob plate but honestly I prefer the other things.  And my absolute favorite dish is actually the homestyle chicken noodle soup.  Super fresh tasting.  So many vegetables.  So flavorful.  It's hearty but yet soothing.   Love the rice dish and the dolmas - and I don't normally like dolmas.  So yes my top three dishes i love here: chicken soup, rice dish, dolmas.  they're that good that I order those before even the kabobs.  A few dishes that are good, but I don't necessarily need again: the big plate of cheese, the stroganoff, the goulash like dish.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed these dishes a lot, but you can't order 10 dishes every time you go.  Or can you...  Drink selection isn't too great but it's ok.  They serve water in huge vodka bottles.",

    "text": "I love the eclectic design of this restaurant! It's nothing like the older photos depicted on their business page. Everything inside looks cool. I was told the owner had redesign the layout from the wall art, the contrast in color and texture, to the unique style of table arrangement. It is fascinating to see a vine of lush green leaves as a wall decor. It kind of resembles an enchanting hedge maze, which makes me wonder if there is a mysterious labyrinth behind those wall. When I did take a peak around the wall, there is a door with a cleverly designed painting that says \"Office.\" You'll also discover another intricate and magnificent painting that was done and creatively displayed by the owner near the bar area.   The food is serve as tapas style. Jasmine had some great recommendations for me to try. For drinks, I went with a Black Iced Tea ($3) and ordered an Ibiza Salad and Chicken Kabob. While waiting for the meal, Jasmine brought a cute orange colander filled with bread. That is the first I've seen, very creative! The bread texture taste more like a biscuit than a soft bread. You eat the bread by dipping it in a mixture of extra virgin olive oil and seasoning that they have set on the table. The seasoning has a lot of different spices. Personally, I feel the seasoning may be a little salty for me. Maybe I'm just accustomed to having a preference for butter on bread.   The Ibiza Salad ($14) has a spring mix of spinach, arugula, and lettuce that's toss with red onions, cherry tomatoes, dried cranberries, quinoa, crushed marcona almonds, avocado, goat cheese, and it's drizzled with olive oil & jerez vinegar reduction. This salad taste amazing! It's full of great flavor and the array of ingredients that's mixed into this salad gives it a perfect balance of sweet and savory.   The Chicken Kabob ($11) comes in five grilled chicken breast serve with a delicious plov that's mixed with carrots, garlic, raisins, fresh parsley, and it's accompanied with juicy slices of red tomatoes. The meat is tender and nicely grilled, it has like a peppercorn flavor added to it. I wish I have more of the plov, it's a very tasty rice pilaf which does have raisins. So if you're not a fan of raisins, you can ask to omit it. They are very accommodating to special request.   For dessert, they do have Biscuit Cake but I opt more for the Baklava ($6), it's a triangular pastry filled with walnuts and raisin that's serve with a sweet honey syrup. If you have a sweet tooth, the baklava would be the best choice. It is rather sweet for me but overall, it is still a good dessert.   I really appreciate Jasmine for being so awesome. She definitely welcome me at the restaurant with such genuine kindness and she has this amazing burst of energy and love for Bulgarian food. Jasmine made the whole experience for me worth coming back. What highlight it is the music. They infuse the atmosphere with a fun upbeat selection of European songs, it's like dining inside a dance club. Just everything about this place makes me feel alive and happy to be here.",

We could not sleep all night but drank a lot of water after the dinner there. The menu is not big and they did not have few of the tapas we wanted to try. The menu and prices on yelp are too old.For example the Thracian clay pot is not $7.99 but $12; Khachapurri is not $8.50 but $13....A reputable restaurant will keep it updated. Oh,  and they brought a house bread that we did not order and then charged us $3 for it. This restaurant does not represent the wonderful Bulgarian cuisine.  If you really want to try traditional Bulgarian dishes go to BG Bistro.  We were so disappointed we chose Forte to celebrate our family reunion based on all the media advertisement. One star for the good waiter.",

I loved every dish we got, but my favorite had to be either the Alsace flatbread or the grape leaves.  It's really hard to determine which i liked more.  We also had the manchego fundito, some kind of dumping that I cannot remember the name of, and the charcuterie board.    They also have some funky margaritas that some of the people in our party tried.  One of the more interesting ones had a small flower that you ate to numb your mouth and it changes the flavor of the drink.  Overall, this was a great experience and I highly recommend it.

Forte is in an unassuming location off rainbow and flamingo near Lee discount liquor sits this culinary delight.   The quality of the food here was amazing.  The service incredible even though the girl working said she had been there under a month when we asked. They must choose good people to be the face of the business.   We started with bacon wrapped dates. I need these again. So flavorful, savory, salty and sweet. The flavors merged together in a medley of awesome. A couple of days later and I'm still thinking about them.  Next we had the beef dumplings with homemade sour cream. I thought I hate sour cream but I couldn't get enough. The dumplings were so rich in flavor and I wish they sold packs of 20 or 30. Just like the dates I'm still thinking about them.  Finally we had feta in phillo dough. This was good. Warm and gooey. This was our least favorite item because the other two are impossible to beat. I would get this with a vodka martini as it would pair really well.   They also have house bread which is dipped in oil and a spice blend. This was quite good. A solid item in between dishes.   The interior and little market is fabulous. The bathrooms are adorable. The lighting perfect. The music really set the mood. The water tasted filtered which is a huge plus. We were encouraged to sit back and enjoy ourselves.  Every aspect of this place has love and attention put into it. There is nothing that was off putting or seemed thrown together. The food was amazing I'm sure I mentioned that. The atmosphere lovely and the service attentive but not annoying.   I could give this place 10 stars.  Thank you Forte for a memorable dining experience.",

The theme has that eastern European vibe to it and the tapas are not Spanish tapas but European tapas. It was the first time I've had European tapas in Vegas. It's definitely unique in that sense and a great first experience. Rumor in town has it that they have one if the best vodka nights in town. I'm definitely going back!",

The restaurant itself is so cute. There's greenery outside and cute plants everywhere. When you walk in there's almost like a cafe kind of place and they sell a bunch of cute stuff (olives, spices, etc). Then on the left side is the restaurant part. Eclectic seating which really cool acrylic chairs.  The drinks are really cool they have this \"juice\" and you can have it as a shot or in a mixed drink. It was fabulous! I ordered their version of a Moscow mule and it was so yummy!   The food was real good authentic food. We had a charcuterie board and this sausage plate. All their types of sausage and their meatballs. I definitely recommend getting this plate! We also have this bread with goat cheese in it and it was heaven in my mouth! And of course dessert! Baklava and biscuit cake, tasted amazing!  What a great spot to have off the strip! Can't wait to come back again!!",

    "text": "Okay, I feel like I have been doing a disservice to this establishment and to my fellow yelpers. It's been a minute since I've been to this place. However, here it is and I'm going to put it down for this place as best I can remember, and since I'm reverting back to my Vegas experiences, this place is definitely memorable. Let me tell you, asides from a Brazilian churrascaria, which is a whole category in itself  in which I will eventually have to review  at a later date,  places like this really make it hard to stick to a raw/vegan diet !        Now, I'll have to disclose, that if you are adventurous, and you like to try new foods and being out of your comfort zone, then this is the place for you. It was like an adventure.         Location: Away from the strip, there are a lot of strip malls. This restaurant is in one, and you have to look closely because if no one is outside on the patio, then it appears that it's closed. Don't be fooled, just be open and trust that this place won't disappoint.        Decor: a hodgepodge of segunda (second-hand) furniture mixed with a touch of \"Design within Reach.\"        Ambiance: Riveting, yet intriguing. It gives you a feeling of ambivalence because you're not sure what to expect, especially when you get the menu. At least that's the way I felt, but things changes when the food was presented, then consumed.      It was my second time in Vegas as an adult. I was able to drink and enjoy all the pleasures of Vegas as an adult, and it was the first time I was actually taken to a local spot by a local, my bro. Personally, I like Vegas for the buffets, but now, this place gives me more of an incentive.       Food: Here at Forte they offer a more eclectic European tapas from Germany, France, Russia, Italy, and Mediterranean  in addition to some staple Spanish ones.  They also offer Spanish style sandwiches such as Jamon & Quesa Bocadillo, pizzas such as Lox and Red caviar , different soups such as your classic  Russian Borsht, and salads such as Shopska which is a Bulgarian salad containing tomato, cucumber, green onion, roasted red peppers,topped with imported Bulgarian feta. Unfortunately, I don't have much more of description of the other tapas that we ordered since I waited so long to review, but this place was without a shadow of a doubt a place that needed props being that there are so few reviews. Due to hard times,  I know there are leery restaurant goers, however,  this place left such a great impression on me that I still had to bring  awareness the wonderful experience that I had here.           Anyways,  with all the countries that I have mentioned, you can imagine the layers of flavors and textures that this restaurant works with offering a cornucopia of European cuisines. One of my most memorable tapas, which I do not remember the name of, was a German dish. It was a beef stew loaded with onions. German food if you are not familiar, is hearty feel-good food, tasty, and filling. This was all of that and more. Could have had another dish of this, but if I did, wouldn't have had any more room to taste the other delicious dishes that we ordered. Everything ..... well, all I have to say is by the time we were done, the plates were licked clean.       Great place to experience foods not usually offered at those trendy, expensive restaurants on \"the strip,\" good for sharing, great international wine selection, service is very hospitable, and food and wine priced  very affordable. You will will leave feeling \"completely\" satisfied and with a broader food repertoire. With this kind of place, it enables people to appreciate different foods that we are missing out on unless you are an avid  world traveler.         Be daring, try new food, appreciate the global  fares Forte European Tapas Bar & Bistro offers, and most of all,                                                      Enjoy!",

    "text": "I've been hearing about this place for some time now and was excited to try it. It's crazy that it took us this long to make it here since it is a stone's throw from our house. We went for lunch and it was pretty empty with only one waitress working. She was attentive but as the place started to fill up she got a bit overwhelmed. The bread they bring is phenomenal and when paired with the oil and spices I felt like I didn't need anything else it was so good. I ordered the Chebureki (Georgian style, deep fried beef dumpling) for us to share; the dumplings were very tasty the beef was very flavorful. They reminded me of an empanada in shape and pastry but the taste was very different. For our main courses I ordered the Bulgarian Mixed Grill (3 sausages) and my bf ordered the Goulash. I liked two of the sausages a lot, the third was ok just not for me sadly I don't know which was which. The beans that are served with the dish are very good if not a bid over oiled, i did not care for the red dipping sauce it is served with. My bf's goulash was very tasty though the serving was small and it was a bit on the salty side. We really liked the atmosphere of the place, there is tons to look at, the discotheque music was terrible and if it weren't for that we probably would have stayed longer. All in all we will certainly be back if for nothing else then to try the yummy looking biscuit cake.",

    "text": "Went there for dinner recently with family. Found the place easily but we thought we had the wrong place initially. From the outside, the place was nothing special. If there weren't some tables or chairs on the sidewalk in front of it, I don't think we would have found the right place or door to enter. From outside it looks like a smoke shop or a convenience store. There are posters and all kinds of stuff on the windows, not something you would expect at a classier place or restaurant. Inside we were pleasantly surprised however. Place was nice and cozy and nice music. It was overall a nice atmosphere...more lounge like than restaurant like. I think they'll get a lot more business if the make the outside look presentable too. If I was just driving by and wanted to eat, I would have never stopped there bc from outside it looks like a 1 star place. Anyway, we sat to eat. We had a toddler with us but they have no high-chairs for kids. Please get some. There were others with little kids and babies and NO baby seats so parent had to hold all the kids. Good thing ours was old enough to sit in chair without falling.   Service was great and fast. Waiters were nice and professional. Place was very clean. Our orders were taken quickly and the food started coming out fast. One thing we did not like was that some of us got our meals before we even got our drinks or salads or appetizers. Who does that? Waitress told us that she has to bring us the food as the chef makea it, but c'mon. But why would the chef make our main course before our salad and appetizers. I was already full before my appetizer, soup and salad came out. My family waited to get soup and salad before touching their meals, but by that time their main course meal was already cold. Food was ok. Nothing to write home about. It wasn't bad by any means but the fries were overcooked and hard and crispy and all the meats were very very dry. No juice on the meat at all. My wife and mother had the chicken soup. I didn't try but they said it was so bland that they each started adding whatever salt and spices we had on the table to give it flavor. My toddler loves soup but she didn't even want that one. It wasn't bad people, just  could be better...juicier, more flavor and served IN ORDER....... Drinks, appetizers, soup/salad, main course, dessert, etc. Overall we had a good experience. Place and staff are good. I would go again eventually. I do recommend you try for yourself and I hope owners take some pointers from this review.",

The chicken soup was tasteless, the chorizo was not very spicy and the sauce was like warmed red wine. None of the hot dishes ordered were hot, and several were way salty. The staff were like zombies, they were nice but going through the motions. It really felt like we picked an off night. I will try again as I always like to give a place a fair chance but I will not run back. Oh quick note ... I am not a big sangria fan but they served a vey tasty Sangria and a very tasty mojito.",

    "text": "The place gets 1 star for several reasons, most of all for trying to serve crap under the guise of freshly prepared tapas. One such example is their so called spanish tuna which they get from the can and afterwards add some sliced tomatoes and serve it to customers. I come from a cultural background where many of those eastern European dishes are common in our household so I know what those things ought to taste like, I cant say they were terrible but it was definitely not worth the price. Also having gone to Barcelona myself their so called jamon iberico was just another sliced up pork and nothing like the iberico from Spain. The squid stuffed with its ink came semi warm and had a nasty fish taste to it rather than what they make you believe. a combination of bad food, bad service, trying to make you believe that their food is something it's not (dishonesty) gets this place the 1 star review. It's no wonder that we were the one of two tables occupied in the whole place. Stick with firefly and your will be a lot more happier.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place for a couple months, so when I got an email from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> advertising a $25 coupon for $2 it seemed like the perfect time to finally check it out.  The bf and I went on Friday night around 8pm and when we arrived there were a couple people at the bar, and that was it. Eating in empty restaurants makes me pretty uncomfortable, but we are always looking for places with a little character (and not part of a chain) so we wanted to give it a shot. After we sat down, the girl that was behind the bar came and took our drink order and gave us menus. There was no actual drink menu, which seemed strange for a place that supposedly has all kinds of infused vodkas and intl beers. Anyway, a couple more people trickled in and it seemed like they were all regulars. The bartender/waitress came back and took our order, but didn't write anything down and after I rattled off a few things she asked if we just wanted to start with that. Um, ok, but it's tapas and I'm hungry! There were a couple other things we had already decided on, but whatever. She did mention the portions of some of the things we ordered were small, which I expected from tapas, so we definitely wanted to order more. It's a pet peeve of mine when waiters don't write down orders--I'm sure some people really have fantastic memories, but 98% of the time I've had a waiter not write down an order it's gotten messed up in some way. This time was no exception. We were brought 2 different things that we hadn't ordered and had to remind her a couple of times what we had actually ordered. For a while it seemed like the girl was the only person working and since some of the people that had arrived after us were sitting out on the patio, she was a little all over the place and clearly needed help. A bit later another girl showed up (and FINALLY refilled my water) and things were slightly smoother after that. They were both really nice so I hate to complain, but they were just not on top of it.   On to the food....first, we ordered a manchego, piquillo pepper toast which was ok, an eggplant dish that really needed bread or something since it was basically a dip (they did bring us bread when we asked for it), shrimp in garlic and olive oil and a Spanish tortilla. Everything had a bit too much oil (except the tortilla) and felt like it was just missing something. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't great either. The tortilla was more like a frittata with potatoes than a traditional Spanish tortilla. We also ordered manchego on grilled toast (I looooove manchego cheese) and a pepper stuffed with feta--I think it was called burek on the menu. I didn't realize it was going to be battered and deep fried, so it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. The breading was a bit thick for my taste, but the melty feta inside was good. I wasn't really sure what to make of the creamy dill sauce it came with. It looked like it was going to be tzatziki, but it most certainly wasn't. Oh well.   Since we had the certificate from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> our total bill (food, 2 beers and 1 cocktail) came to right about $30. That also included 18% gratuity (calculated on pre-discounted check per the certificate) so it was pretty reasonable. However, it bums me out when I use a certificate that requires gratuity to be automatically added and I receive shitty service. I think if we hadn't used a certificate and paid $55 for our meal I would've been more unsatisfied. I really want to give 2.5 stars, but I'll bump it up because I think this place has potential and I want them to succeed. I would try it again...but maybe just to have a couple drinks and a snack instead of a full dinner.",

Its in a strip mall between a cigarette store and a jewelery repair shop.  The windows are covered up.  Seriously, it looked like it was either closed or a store front for organized crime.  But when I walked in the door the difference is night and day, literally it's kinda dark. Anyway I had the sausage combo.  I forgot what it was called. Possibly something with a lot of B's and K's.  Brokkfrughen or Krubbbrrnfffyka maybe; I don;t know.  But it was good.  It came with some navy beans and a sauce that I really enjoyed.  i believe it was made from pimentos or something.  Never the less it was delicious. The service was kinda slow,  One lady seemed to be the bartender hostess and waitress.  I believe she was Russian.  Nyet,  Sorry thats the only Russian I know.  Wait.....Stolnichaya.  I know that too. Anyway had the food, prices were reasonable and I would go back.  oh and try the Sangria I hear its a good cure for a hangover.",

The food was very tasty with every bite a unique flavor sensation add to that awesome service, cool drink offerings and funky/interesting decor and this was a hit! We tried the GF Forte Jackass drink which had ginger infused vodka, ginger beer and limes, yum!!! I had the Pelmeni which were Russian style meat dumplings, sprinkled with fresh dill, green onions and served with sour cream. My companion had the Bulgarian Mixed Grill which had 3 types of sausages Kiufte, Kebabche & Loukaniko w/ Bulgarian bean relish, liuteniza & european slaw. Both were fantastic. We finished with a Russian version of a Tiramisu and OMG it was awesome, way better than any Tiramisu I have ever had. My companion had the baklava and it too was different than any baklava we have ever eaten and really delicious. The prices were really reasonable, the entire meal cost us about 35.00. I so wish I lived near enough to go back and eat my way thought the entire menu, over multiple visits of course.",

    "text": "I have been to three Balkan restaurants here in Las Vegas over the past few months. I have been trying to visit Forte after meeting Chef Nina and sampling her food at a taping of American Chefs but my schedule did not permit.    Finally last evening my dear friend from Belgrade surprised me with a special treat for my birthday,  dinner at Forte.  No matter your cuisine preference this restaurant offers comfort food executed elegantly with no pretense what so ever.    The Shopska Salad, best I have ever had the pleasure to eat,  with Persian cucumber, tomato, sweet softened green pepper and Bulgarian feta - a classic and even though one is big enough to share , don't fool yourself you will finish the whole dish.  The stuffed peppers - words cannot describe. Guy Fieri got this one right!  As a bonus the patio, the subtle decor and the warm ambiance, Chef Nina has brought Eastern Europe to Las Vegas - do yourself a favor - get there sooner rather than later! I am looking forward to the caviar and few more Balkan favorites on my next visit.   KD",

Our waiter answered questions, made thoughtful recommendations, and was attentive to our needs.  We shared the bacon wrapped dates, a great cucumber, tomato feta salad, the clay pot dish and assortment of Bulgarian sausage.  The food was perfectly seasoned and very tasty.  It is well worth the cab ride to get off the strip and have a great ethnic meal.  Our whole meal only cost $35 and was just right for two.  We well definitely return when we are in Vegas and recommend it to friends and family.",

Great date night atmosphere ..dark cozy and comfortable.  There was also live music which was great because it wasn't ridiculously loud - you could still carry on your conversations.  I had a delicious cocktail that came in a copper mug - can't remember the name of it - it had ginger infused vodka, lime and ..? We'll worth the eight dollars.  Home made bread was excellent - the olive oil was top quality - reminded me of the olive oil that you get in Greece.  The feta cheese pastry was like a dessert.  The meat dumplings were good they were very meaty -almost games which I wasn't I the mood for at the time but they were delicious regardless.  Bacon wrapped Marcona almond stuffed dates were yummy and the biscuit cake dessert was as delicious As it sounds.",

Both of us were quite impressed. It had a friendly, \"local dive\" atmosphere too. I can imagine that every person of Bulgarian decent must surely come eat at this place. We recommend it.",

Went in with my husband and his friends visiting from out of town and our 2 year old. The first impression was a cozy spot to hang out. Then we found out they had no highchairs. At all!  What a bummer! We almost left because of this and then realized we had his stroller in the car so that might work. I had a couple of their cocktails nothing really stood out. My husband and his friend had a bunch of different items. Everything I tasted was good. The only thing I wasn't really fond of was the stuffed dates. The sauce was a little too sweet and thick almost reminiscent of a balsamic glaze I felt that it also needed a crunch or crispness of some type.. it almost felt one note. I rather have Firefly's stuffed dates any day.. beside that service was great our server was patience with answering our questions about the menu and recommending things.  Definitely will be back...hopefully they have highchairs by then.",

    "text": "After seeing the restaurant on Diners, Drive-in's and Dives, and having had a lot of great meals from watching this TV program I had been looking forward to trying out  Forte.   UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS A REALLY BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.  When my wife and I arrived there were maybe 6 to 8 people in the restaurant.  There were 3 small tables in the bar area and we asked to be seated in one of these.  We were informed by the hostess/waitress that they \"were reserved for more than just 2 people...\"  This seemed odd when there was only one person sitting in the whole bar area.   We were shown to a table way in the back and directly under the music speaker. The music was so loud it was difficult to speak.  We got up and asked for another table from a different waitress who took us to the bar area and sat us at one of the tables that had earlier been off-limits?  We sat and waited for our drink order to be taken for at least 10 minutes,  we then waited for another 10 minutes to get a menu.  At this point we were thinking things were not looking good. OK, moving on we ordered - and again waited, finally got our drinks and food at the same time. Total time after being seated at least 30 minutes.    But like most people we thought, \"hey- if the food is good we could forgive the poor service.\"  Unfortunately it was not to be!  The portions that were shown on the TV program were much larger and with better presentation than what we received - we had purposely ordered the same items.  The food we received was tepid and flavorless.  As I said earlier it was a big disappointment.  As we waited for our check the owner came over and asked \"How was everything?\" we told her \"not great\"  (I was being kind)  She did not inquire further but said something as she left our table like \"...hope to see you again\"  Kind of the robotic comment that was not unexpected - considering the entire evenings experience.  Service, ambiance and food all get a big ZERO.  We will not be going back and will not be recommending this restaurant to anyone.",

We were a group of six who met there on a Saturday at 2:00. The restaurant was not busy at all and we got seated right away. The server did not come for our order for about fifteen minutes. Once we ordered, the food came out quickly, even though I was told the clay pot took 25 minutes to make. The clay pot left a bit to be desired but the stroganoff and dumplings were excellent.  Chicken soup was okay, not great. The bread was fabulous. I think that was the best part of our meal. We had to ask for the check to be brought and the server never asked if we wanted anything other than water to drink, which was very odd.  Overall we were there for about an hour and a half, way too long for the small amount of food we ordered.  I doubt I'll be going back.",

I was already stuffed but had to try this dessert which melts in your mouth.. the only thing better would have been coffee with it but it was gone before coffee could have arrived, so order your coffee in advance.  At the end of the meal Nina stopped by.  it was nice to meet her and thank her for the quality she is committed to as she brings old world foods into a modern atmosphere.  Great job of respect for family and tradition while doing something new.   Im already looking forward to my next trip to Vegas so I can come back and bring more friends.",

I joined the empty plate club no problem.  The best part I got it all for under $30. They have happy hour specials too every night. Two thumbs up, definitely going back and bringing friends.

    "text": "This place is excellent. We're always looking for something next to try, and I'm glad we tried this place out. It's so different and unique in comparison to other restaurants in town.   As soon as we walked in, most of the crowd was speaking several different languages. Perfect sign for me - I knew it was going to be good.   We had some of the Russian beer - served with beautiful clay mugs.  Dat bread - the bread is delicious. It's so fluffy, yet filling. We were starving when we walked in, so I was very grateful for this.  The clay pot -  very different. It wasn't my favorite, but the sausage in it was very tasty.  The shrimp saute -  very very good. It had a very good white wine sauce and fresh lemon. Dip your bread in it.  And my favorite - the beef stroganoff. So so so so good!!! Probably the best I've ever had in my life. Served with delicious mushroom filled dumplings.   It was very busy, so expect a wait. The service was good, they just seemed under staffed.   Overall, it was awesome. I can't wait to go back!!",

    "text": "This is a hidden gem inside the Spring Valley Town Center shopping plaza. It has Eastern European (e.g., Bulgaria, Serbia, Russia) food. Some items come as tapas and others are large enough to be considered a meal. I usually get several items. I enjoy the restaurant decor, food, service, and entertainment. At night they have a piano player. The restaurant is colorful and comfortable.  My favorite soup is the Borscht (beet soup) and my favorite seasonal salad is the Forte Fetamelon Salad. The soup is served hot and has beets, cabbage, potatoes, and a dollop of sour cream. It is absolutely great! The Fetamelon Salad has freshly cut watermelon, red onion, mint leaves, and Bulgarian feta. I actually look forward to summer to enjoy this salad.  The Bulgarian Easter Lamb is amazing. The lamb is tender and the portion is satisfying. It is served with a small salad and mashed potatoes. I usually get this with the Thracian Clay Pot, which is a small hot pot that is backed with egg, tomatoes, peppers, sausage, and feta. It sounds strange, but it is definitely a must try. This item often takes 20 minutes to bake.   My favorite mixed grill is the Bulgarian one. It has a great selection of Bulgarian meats and I love the various bean, relish & slaws as they go great with the meat. Just don't think you can order extra of the slaws - They are served only with the mixed grill and you cannot obtain a side order.   The ice-tea is freshly brewed. The water is served out of old Vodka bottles. They have great tableside herbs that I used to love putting on the bread they serve prior to your meal. I am not a fan of the recent change in the bread they are using. It is not as good as what they used to have a year ago. Maybe they can change it back!?  Try their version of tiramisu cake. It is truly a treat!",

The waitresses definitely add to the authenticity of the restaurant.   We have gotten the pan con tomate both times because it is so fresh and tasty! We also got a salad with cucumbers, fresh feta, green onions, and roasted peppers and I dusted that dish off quick! We splurged and got the $20 cheese, but, and preserve plate. I did not like the bleu cheese at all but the other 3 were delicious. There was a fig served on the side that was obviously soaked in some sort of alcohol. It was a little overpowering. We ended up taking the leftovers of the cheese plate home.  My boyfriend ordered the clay pot and didn't eat much because he was so stuffed from the cheese and and complementary bread that comes with dinner. We have the leftovers in the fridge right now :P  The first time we came here, we got the vereniki which is like a pirogi. It was so amazing and had a very light flavor. My boyfriend got the goulash and liked it very much! It wasn't what I was expecting but he really enjoyed it. I got the adjarski khachapurri which is a boat-shaped bread with cheese and egg in it. It was soo filling and tasty. I'll definitely get that again!!  As far as drinks, we got 3 different drinks and they were during happy hour so it was cheap! I got an angry ginger lemonade and it was wayyyy too gingery for me so my boyfriend drank it. He ordered the GF forte jackass and said it was too gingery but I thought it wasn't too bad! I wanted to get a drink with no ginger so I asked about the gypsytini and the waitress said there wasn't any ginger in it. I ordered it and I was very impressed! A delightful flavor and not too strong! I can't wait to come back!",

Everything is authentic from the food to the plates they are served on. My fiance and I decided to share a bunch of different things:   Almond stuffed bacon wrapped dates: OMG it was the best thing I've eaten in a while!  Red wine chorizo:  Delicious as well.  Russian dumplings: good but a little plain. Nothing too special compared to the rest.   Georgian boat (2 types of cheese with cracked egg in a bread boat):  Delicious!  Thracian Clay Pot: Very good comfort dish.   Almond Cake for dessert:  YUMMY!! So so so good! Our favorite hands down!  Baklava for dessert:  A little disappointed by the fact that it was not a crispy baklava. It's served cold. Pretty sweet. Our least favorite dish of the night.   The drinks are also very good!   Service was amazing and prices are great!   We just loved this place! We even bought one of the Bulgarian handmade plates. Go try it if you're in Vegas!",

Since my last visit, menu has changed and service is more cohesive with both more employees and a hot black-and-white striped dress as a uniform. I dig it!  THRACIAN CLAY POT: A must-order, featured on the Triple D special. Similar to an Israeli shakshuka dish, the flavors of tomato, egg, and peppers mix well. \"Unlike anything I've ever had before,\" according to a well-traveled friend of ours.  STROGANOFF FRIES: The stroganoff ragu they do so well here is now used in a European version of chili fries, and to great success. These are addictive!  SOLYANKA: traditional Russian soup with lemon and smoked meats, super tasty. Best version of this soup that I've had anywhere, and that's saying something.  SOFIISKA BANIZA: Rolls of filo dough stuffed with feta cheese and served with sour cream, even more delicious than burekas, it's a calorie bomb but so damn worth it.  Service is attentive, drinks are strong (Jackass, Mint Ginger Lemonade, and Sangria are all solid options), and the music is live- great place to catch up with friends and share a ton of food you won't find anywhere else in Vegas.",

    "text": "Nice little unassuming place as a perfect starter for a trip to Europe.  Came here with two others.  Ambiance - 4 Stars.  From the outside patio, it looks like any other small restaurant hole in the wall in a strip mall.  It does have outside seating, but inside is better.  Go inside, and the decor/feel is more like an old Seattle Coffee House or a quaint European eatery.  It was quirky, funky, comfortable, relaxed, charming, and generally upbeat.  Great for loud conversations with good friends.  Service - 5 Stars.  From the host when we walked in to the server, the staff were stellar.   We were greeted and seated promptly, with a welcoming smile.  The server was happy to spend time discussing the different dishes, and free and honest in her critiques when we asked her opinion of various dishes.  She kept tabs on us and our progress throughout the meal, timing herself perfectly so as to never come over when our mouths were full of food, but also making sure we were lacking nothing, and even timing perfectly to ask if we were enjoying our dishes.  At the end of the meal, and after dessert, she was happy to chat with us and give me suggestions of food and alcohol to have on an upcoming trip.  Truly professional, super friendly staff here.  Food - 4.5 Stars.  Our starter was the Epicurious Cheese Plate ~ excellent choice with a varied selection of four cheeses paired with nuts and preserves - my oddly favorite mix was the bell pepper type jelly paired with the Qeso de Cabra (I never expected to like bell pepper flavored jelly, but it worked so very well with the cheese).  For main courses we had Hungarian Goulash, Bulgarian Easter Lamb, and Serbian Mixed Grill (yes, we oddly hit up three different countries there).  The Goulash and Lamb were both reviewed as great (though the goulash had one piece of dried spice that had not fully blended in - thus the -.5 star) by those eating the dish, and for me, the Serbian Mixed Grill was a perfect match for my craving.  The spices for the mixed grill meats were unusual for me, but a nice pairing.  The server warned it might be spicy, but i found it to be very mild with a great overall flavor.  I'm not sure what the name of the sausage was, but it was perhaps the most uniquely flavored (in a positive way) sausage I've had.  For dessert, which we almost passed up because we were stuffed by this time (don't DON'T pass up dessert here), we tried the Bulgarian Biscuit Cake, which is basically a lighter, smoother, more yummy version of tiramisu ~ as in, tiramisu 2.0.  Don't question it, just order it.  What's a few pounds between friends?  Drink - 5 Stars.  They have Ginger Beer.  I got addicted to that stuff in Australia, and to find it here anywhere was amazing.  That aside, my friend had a red wine that was very nice and full bodied with hints of berry and no overpowering wood flavor (sorry I forget the name of the wine).  I had a Troyanska Rakija, which is apparently a plum brandy.  I ordered it because of the name, without knowing what it was, and with instructions to the server to not tell me, which she chuckled at, and warned me not to drink it in one shot when she brought it to the table.  The Troyanska Rakija was excellent, from the nice, vaguely fruity scent, to the warm glow it imparted.  Recommendations - Come here with friends and expect to have light-hearted fun.  Have the Bulgarian Biscuit Cake, and then whatever else tickles your fancy at the time.  Try the Troyanska Rakija.  And if you've only ever had Ginger Ale, do yourself a favor and order a Ginger Beer.  Avoid - Nope, I've got nothing.  Oh, yes, if you're seated inside, avoid the step, especially if you choose to drink.",

    "text": "I'd seen Forte a million times, its in the same strip mall as two of the stores I shop at frequently.  The other night, my fella and I took a walk up to La Bonita, and decided that we would have date night at Forte on Saturday night.  We arrived at about 9:00pm, and walked in, not really knowing if they were open or not, as there were two people out on their patio, but there wasn't an \"open\" sign or anything.  Luckily, they were still open, and the kitchen was working until 10 pm.   We were seated, and one of the girls brought over two glasses and water...in an old vodka bottle!  How fun.   We were given some bread with Bulgarian spices and olive oil...this was delicious. the bread was crispy on the outside, and super soft on the inside...I really need to learn to make bread like this!!  We chose: Marcona Almond Stuffed dates, wrapped in bacon: These were tasty.  Granted, I was comparing them to the other tapas place that shall not be named and has been shut down, because THOSE were always amazing...I found these to be not quite on par, but still enjoyable.    Gambas Al Ajillo: Shrimp sauteed with garlic, white wine and spanish olive oil.  This was good, but a little disappointing in the size.  $6.99 for 5 TINY shrimp.  Now, the flavor was good.  Really good actually...so good we took the bread and sopped up the \"sauce\" that was left over.  But...at $1.40 per shrimp, I want the shrimp to be a little bigger, even if there aren't as many.  I would have been fine with 4 larger shrimp, not even jumbo.    Lamb Ragu served over polenta:  I wish I remembered all the details of this special (not on their regular menu)...there was this cheese that they served over it...oh my stars it was delicious. I'm picky about lamb, and this was cooked very well.  There were a few pieces that seemed a little fatty for my taste, but all in all, this was a good dish.  I enjoyed the polenta, never having had it before, and thought that it worked really well with the lamb and herbs.  A winner.  We also have a glass of refreshing sangria.  At $5 a glass or $23 for a pitcher, this was a good choice.  We only had a glass a piece, but I would definitely drink it again.   Service was friendly, but a little slow.  It took a while for someone to come take our order, and to bring the check, but the food came out in a timely fashion, and we were really not in a hurry, so it wasn't awful.  I'd honestly like to either have the servers speak up just a touch, or turn the music down a little...it wasn't overly loud by any means, but one of the girls that was taking care of us was very soft spoken, so it was hard to hear her over the music.  I love the decor.  It fits very will with the name:  Forte, in musical terms, means \"loud or strong.\"   The decor itself is very loud, and very artsy.  They also had a guitar player/singer who played some soft dining music while we were there.  That was fun.  All in all, I really enjoyed my visit to Forte.  I definitely plan to go back and try some more things from the menu, and maybe have a mojito next time!",

Highlights for me were the Adjarski Khachapurri and stroganoff, though I didn't snag a bite of anything that was less than tasty.  Also, I was enchanted by the painted glass my cocktail arrived in, it was deemed instagram worthy! After checking out their website, it seems it was painted by the owner herself, which between that and her \"punking\" of Guy Fieri (also viewable on the website) leads me to believe she's a pretty neat lady.  Can't wait to go back with an empty stomach and an eager dining companion.",

Only exception was the Forte fries, which were good because they had feta and garlic on them, but they were just fries.  Their sausages are made in house and are awesome. The feta melon salad is so good we started making it at home, but we still order it when we go there. The bacon wrapped date are usually a dessert item for us, which goes really well with our last sips of wine.  Only criticism is every time we find a bottle of wine there we like, they change the wine list and we have to start over. Oh well, we love trying new wines.",

    "text": "The best little hole in the wall in Vegas!  Came here with a group of girlfriends from work, one being from Russia. We had made a reservation ahead of time, for which I was glad. At 7 pm, the place was pretty packed, but began clearing out a bit around 8 pm.   Here's what was on our table:  Adjarski Khachapurri - giant boat bread with soft cheese and a cracked egg. This was amazing. The flavor wasn't overdone and it was fresh out of the oven!  Beef Strogannoff Ragu - we all know what this is and it was awesome  Vereniki and Pelmeni - two different types of dumplings with sour cream. They were not overly greasy and paired with the sour cream...amazing!.  We ordered some of their signature house drinks and a bottle of wine.   I have to give the food 5 stars. It was so nice to go to a place where the tapas wasn't pre-made and sitting under heat lamps getting greasy and dried out (*cough* Firefly *cough*). The food was not overly seasoned to cover up the lack of quality...like a lot of places do. The vegetables and fresh seasonings (scallions, parsley, etc.) served with each dish really complimented the home cooking and quality ingredients.   The service was slow, but due to everything being fresh out of the oven, it was more than acceptable. Plus, in Euro culture, you take your time to eat and talk. Why is everyone in such a hurry?! We stayed here for over 4 hours listening to the live music and chatting away. It was a really nice atmosphere, and we all left happy.",

Whatever you choose you can't go wrong, and it's not grossly over-priced or over-hyped like so many of the restaurants on the Strip.  Prompt and friendly service, warm atmosphere, and even European club music to round out the European feel.  Highly recommend Forte if you live in or are visiting Las Vegas.",

Our waitress was really helpful and recommended several dishes to try as it was our first time eating there. She just about mentioned everything on the menu, so we decided to order 6 dishes for the four of us. Everything we tried was delicious and fresh.  You get a basket of bread to start your meal. The Bulgarian spice blend in the wooden spice box on the table, mixed with the olive oil, was so tasty! We debated getting more bread but decided to hold off for the rest of the dishes. We ordered stuffed grape leaves, Mediterranean salad, beef stroganoff ragu, the Bulgarian mixed grill, Thracian clay pot, and chicken shish kebab. We liked everything, especially the ragu, grape leaves, and mixed grill plate, and found ourselves satisfied. We ordered a baklava to share for dessert and liked that the syrup was very light and thin so it wasn't so sweet, like the kind you buy from the store.   If we're ever back in the area, we'll be back to try more from their menu!",

I love that they have an ice chest chilling beer on tap in the front.  Food was great - Had the tripe soup, lamb confit and greek grilled plate and fries. soup was ok. lamb was very good. grilled plate great. fries to die for.  Wines here are cool but not over priced. not a bottle over $80. a lot of east european wines too. average per bottle is around $50 and the beers you cant get anywhere else. try the infusions as well  Services was a bit lacking. never knew who my server was but i think one of the managers or owners keep coming by. she was a red head but didn't think that she was a waiter.  If any of you remember a place called Jazzed on East Trop or Durango and Sahara...then this place has the same feel but not italian",

    "text": "I really wanted to like Forte more than I did. I went in optimistic and came out kind of disappointed.   Part of it was just bad luck. My wife ordered a diet coke and got light brown water because the fountain was down and the server hadn't noticed. She instead ordered a mango juice only to find that they were out. So she had a peach juice instead, which was good but tasted a little bit too much like canned peaches for my tastes. I ordered a mojito. It was plenty strong, but the bartender didn't use enough sugar and the mint was pretty obviously on its way out. I also don't think it got much of a muddle, if any.  The first thing they bring out foodwise is their house-made bread, which was nice and flavorful, especially dipped in the olive oil which is fruity and fragrant. There is a little wooden boat with herbs for the oil, only we weren't provided a spoon so it was difficult to use it. Not a big deal. We managed.  We ordered the pelmeni, vareniki, serrano and manchego, and garlic herb fries. The fries were tasty and they brought plenty of them, so if you're looking for filler it's a good bet. The garlic could have been a little stronger, but I'm kind of a garlic fiend so take that with a grain of salt. The pelmeni were juicy and delicious and the dumpling wrappers had bite and weren't waterlogged. The manchego and serrano was good, but I would have appreciated the ham being cut into pieces so we didn't have to hack the thing up every time we wanted some. It came with some alcaparrones (caperberries) that added some vinegar contrast to what is otherwise a fatty/salty dish.  The vareniki themselves were tasty, but the fried onions that came on top weren't fried - they were burnt. Instead of deliciously caramelized onions, I got black chunks of carbon with some residual onion flavor. Since the vareniki have a delicate flavor on their own, it overpowered the dumplings and killed the dish.  One other thing: the seating is mostly low cafe tables, so you end up kind of hunching over to get at your food. I think we'd have enjoyed it more sitting at one of the tall bar tables or even at the bar itself.  We're going to give the place another shot, because I don't think anyone should rule out a restaurant based on one experience, but this one wasn't entirely positive.",

    "text": "I was out with my 13 year old son and we were hungry.  I was in an unknown area so I turned to yelp.  One of the top ranked spots was a Bulgarian restaurant named Forte that I had just seen on Guy Fieri's DDD...so we gave it a try.  Don't let the plaza keep you from trying this place.  It's in a predominantly Hispanic plaza anchored by a Mexican market.  My son thought I was joking when I pulled in.  However, the restaurant inside was quite nice.  It felt like a funky restaurant that you would find in San Francisco.  Cool colors, cool posters, and a good mix of deep house music playing on the speakers.    Once we walked in we were greeted by some beautiful servers in tight black striped dresses.  Behind the bar was the even more beautiful owner that I saw on TV.  She was charming and I told her that we were there because the show.    We sat down and our server (I think her name was Nataliya) brought us a loaf of homemade bread and water in a recycled bottle of vodka.  She instructed us to dip the bread in olive oil with an optional mix of Bulgarian spices.  Delicious.    We happened to be there in the last hour of happy hour so I ordered their Angry Lemonade (delicious cocktail with lemon juice, mint, vodka, and a sprig of rosemary).   They serve this in an attractive copper mug.    My son ordered a sprite but the nice touch was the carafe of sprite that they left for refills.    As I said, we were hungry so we ordered the Bulgarian mixed grill, garlic fries, Serrano & Arugula pizza, and Gambas Al Ajillo (delicious shrimp sauteed with garlic, white wine, and other herbs).     I was a little disappointed that the fries came first, but they were delicious.  They looked like McDonald's fries covered with herbs and garlic.  Only $5.  The shrimp came next and these were unbelievable.  It was so good that we immediately ordered another.  The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the white wine sauce was so good that we asked for another loaf of bread so we could dip it.  Only $7.  The pizza was mediocre.  Generous amount of Serrano and arugula...possibly too generous because it was a bit salty.  The texture made it tough to eat.  I don't think it was cooked long enough.  The dough was soft and the pizza was a bit runny.  We are less than half of this and took the rest home.    The mixed grill was as delicious as we saw on TV.  Homemade sausages grilled with an delicious bean relish and this tomato sauce.   Only $11 for this plate.  Wow!!  Service was excellent.  The food was delicious and very reasonable.  The ambience was hip.  This is clearly a restaurant that is well-run with attentive owner-operators.    We will be back with the rest of the family.  I would return to the bar for the beautiful servers.  They were hot!!",

The lamb is so moist and tender. Also enjoyed the octopus, which was served cooked. bread with spices and oil is really good. LOVED the watermelon salad I had last summer (in season only). The clay pot was okay, didn't see as good as I saw from T.V. (food network) Service has been good both times I've gone. They even hooked up my brother with birthday dessert. One of my new favorite spots. Thank you guys!",

    "text": "In Las Vegas, many of the really interesting places to eat are overrated, overcrowded, and overpriced.  When I saw Forte featured on \"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives,\" I was skeptical that the food could be as delicious as it looked and sounded.  But wow, I'm so glad I tried it and found out that I was totally wrong - this is excellent food and drink, in a lovely atmosphere with great service.  The location is definitely more for locals than Strip-visiting tourists, so I'm glad that we had rented a car (to spend our days at Red Rock Canyon and the Valley of Fire).  At first, it wasn't clear that they were open, because the windows are dark (an open sign would aid walk-in business), but we trudged through the patio area and went inside and were met with a gorgeous colorful interior!  It's a fun and eclectic space, I really loved the style.  (The men's room is particularly awesome, decorated in crazy Eastern European propaganda posters.  Or so I hear.)  The table bread was fantastic, especially dipped in oil with their hand-blended spice mix.  We could've eaten tons of it!  Everything on the menu and specials board was enticing, but we finally settled on a bunch of small plates: Adjarski Khachapurri (really fun dough boat, enjoyed the egg on top), Thracian clay pot (smaller than expected, everything inside was tasty), chebureki (dumplings so deliciously flaky and dill-y that we ordered a second round), kebabche (one of the sausages we saw on the show, as delicious as we'd hoped it would be), and the Bulgarian bean relish (refreshing, something I'm going to try to make at home).  I also got two tasty beverages - the angry ginger lemonade (delicious, not at all boozy) and a bloody mary made with their garden veggie-infused vodka (this was so amazing, I need to infuse my own vodkas immediately).  I was stuffed by the end of the meal and still longing to try more things!  The best part?  It was an incredibly affordable meal, especially for the quality and quantity.  You can easily eat a great meal, with drinks, for $25 per person.",

The inside is decorated all European with posters and pictures of European things. its average size inside and has a full bar also. The staff and service are always very good.   Ive tried a lot of things and i can never remember the name because its in bulgarian/ russian / or some other language. My favorite though is the meat platter they have. Its 3 different types of meats sitting on top of diced onions. Comes with a little tomatoe paste and beans. Very flavorful and delicious.  I would definitely come back to hear for lunch/dinner because its very good.",

This isn't a place that mascarades as European cuisine, it truly has all the old world flavor, and you can taste the love that goes into each and every dish.  They have a nice selection of artisan beers and you can even just sit at the bar(I've been known to do so). Every single waitress is so gracious and kind.   Incidentally, I once had a friendly cab driver bring me home from the airport and as we passed Forte, I mentioned that it was a great place to eat. He said, \"Yes, I know.... my wife is cook there\".  Vegas really is a small town.",

The reason we wanted to come here, the Thracian Clay Pot never materialized. And that's disappointing.",

    "text": "Thanks to Guy for putting this place on Triple D! Forte has become our go-to restaurant when we're in Vegas. It's great for date night or an adult gathering, especially if you're a foodie....the kiddies probably wouldn't care for the food.  You wouldn't expect this amazing place to be in this part of Vegas but it's great. Once you walk in you're immediately taken by the decor, upbeat music & incredible ambience.  Once greeted by the friendly staff, or owner who is there often, you are brought scrumptious bread. You need to order a pitcher of Sangria! It's pretty delish, not too sweet but just right.  We always order tapas here & highly recommend items from their specials menu. Last time we were there we had the Lamb Lollipops with Forte Fries...HOLY GOODNESS! Then we had the Artisian Characuterie Plate, also spectacular. It doesn't matter which dish you try, it's a great experience & you will be back for more.  The decor in here is awesome. Love the bar area & it's also a great place to celebrate a birthday, they were preparig for one when we were there & it looked very festive.  Can't wait to go back to Vegas for some more Forte!",

    "text": "Recently stopped by here the last time I was in town after seeing it on DDD, and all I can say is what a welcomed and refreshing change of pace from the usual internationally-inspired restaurant. It really is an authentic European experience taking influences from a range of countries, many of which don't get represented much if at all in the states, and mashes them together into a melting pot of awesomeness.  The adjarski khachapurri, beef stroganoff, and beef and lamb confit were all excellent and seriously flavorful. They do the food right here, and some dishes take time to make. So relax, order a drink, and just enjoy the atmosphere of this place while your order is being prepared. The exceptionally good food, along with the friendly and attentive service, and funky-cool interior made it well worth the cab ride off the strip.",

First off, I'm the kind of gal that loves dill, pickles, tomatoes, mint, basil, feta cheese,boiled potatoes and so on.....I was married to an eastern european guy for a hot minute and the best thing about the marriage was his Mom's cooking....So needless to say, I'm a fan. Regardless though, I have a good palette and having eaten a fair amount of traditional eastern european food, I do consider myself qualified to give an opinion. Which is why I am so baffled at some of the bad reviews on this site....Seems like maybe folks, both at the restaurant and those writing the reviews might have had a couple of bad days.   The prices? Awesome. The food? Awesome. The service? Every time I've been there, Awesome. Last time I went in I looked a hot mess having just driven 11 straight hours coming from Wyoming on a Sunday, starving like mad cause the entire state of Utah was closed for church. Which is cool for me, but I share that to say that  the circumstances of my last visit to the bistro were less than ideal. Ratty road trip clothes, hair and face, walking stiff like Frankenstein, and still, they greeted us with a smile and a cool drink. Seated us right way, the place was full, and brought us delectable treats to nom. We had wine, a roy rogers, goulash, salad and some damn good chicken meatballs and potatoes. Bill was $33 bucks. YES! AH love this place. I'll go back forever.",

The place is painted black, with bizarre paintings on the wall, and some strange object that looks like a dinosaur dropping on a table. There was an odd lamp, with a shade that looked like underwear on it.   I took off one star for the pounding weird loud music that played the entire time we were there. The owner needs to make this place a nice place to dine, or a dive bar. It is more on the edge of dive bar.  That being said, the food...seems to be hit or miss, depending on what you order. The meal started well, with the Mediterranean salad, fresh cucumbers,  tomatoes,  onion, with a delightful sauce. Ample portion for three to have a dinner salad. Another win was the fresh warm bread. The Sangria was weak, pass on that, tasted like Kool-Aid. The Borscht was served warm, with sour cream,  win on that.  The dumplings with meat, I did not care for them,  they tasted of liver to me. The worst dish was the flat bread with basil and tomatoes.  Greasy, not cooked through,  skip this. We also ordered sauteed mushrooms,  served cold, meh...dessert was a honey \"crepe\", more like a pancake.  But it was served with powered sugar and walnuts. The latte I ordered came with whipped cream,  win.   So, the food was okay...The service was also inconsistent.  We left, and went to Fat burger to use the restroom,  mainly due to the fact we could not stand the music and creepy decor any longer.    I would not go here again.  And I am surprised at the rave reviews...and the patio, outside the Smith's, with view of parking lot,  joke.",

But the two stars is about the service, or lack thereof.  We made reservations specifying a birthday, that was ignored as were we for the first 10 minutes after being seated.   Nothing came quickly, no apologies for the slow service and we had to ask for refills to our water 3 times before anyone brought us some.  There was a large birthday celebration just beginning to set up while we were there and MAYBE that threw them off but then be aware of it and apologize to those who got bad service because of it.  I didn't see anyone who could be called a manager there.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and the food and recommended her favorites.  She was from Russia and I trust that what we had would have been considered good by those familiar with the food.  The decor is funky but nice, the guy playing the guitar was reserved and nicely in the background but you can't excuse the slow service.   And maybe the food was good just not up to my tastes and I do think I am adventurous.  Maybe the popularity of this place was the mention of Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives which I didn't see but they promote their appearance on it a lot.  We won't be going back or recommending it to others.",

My wife and I had a great experience and the food was fantastic.  My grandparents are Polish and Ukrainian, so I grew up eating some similar foods.  Similar but not the same.  The dishes have a different spice profile and are more delicate.  The food we had was delicious.  The borscht beat my grandmothers.  The pelmeni are tender and so tasty.  We had both the stroganoff and the plain with sour cream and dill.  We had the Thracian clay pot ... yummy.  We also had the Khachapurri which is a bread with a cheese and egg filling.  Also delicious.  They have a nice selection of vodkas, wines and beers too.  Our service was outstanding.  I think she was the owner, but she was friendly knowledgeable and very engaging.    I highly recommend checking this place out in Las Vegas.  It was better than any meal we have had in the Bellagio I can tell you that.

I have been a server and can overlook a lot of things, but this was unacceptable. I finally left and as I walked past the host/server at the front, she said nothing.  I'm sad because the online menu looked excellent, but I am so peeved at the service that I don't think I will ever return.  Forte needs to learn how to treat a customer!

It was the only thing that came out hot! Everything else was lukewarm or cold. Sadly I wasn't too happy paying for a $90 dinner that was cold! We tried all sorts of tapas and the stroganoff was quite interesting. It was tasty. But it too was not hot... The stuffed grape leaves were good, but it too was not hot. Had some plate of assorted meats, it was ok, nothing that blew me away though. Also had their squid dish over rice, ugh, it was cold! The sad thing is most of our food came on metal/wood combo platter things and you would think your food would be hot....? Nope.

    "text": "It been while since wrote a five star review. Forte is a place that exceeded my expectations not only the food but overall experience was very unique. Lot of things that stood out for me. The fact that small family run business, off the strip not in mega hotel, very reasonable price, interior design screaming personality, and am NOT fan of Tapas style of eating but Forte made me FAN. I came to Forte with my cousins from the 808 visiting also avid yelpers and enjoy food like myself. The few times get together over the years here or back home about trying something new. I was excited too get bookmark off my list and just enjoy time around Ohana.  I knew the interior design has personality from watching the episode on DDD. What you see on television can never prepare you for the real thing. I loved every bit of it! Really small restaurant maybe holds 50 people, the bar area is also small just one row of bar stools, and the dining room is divided into two sections. Each one having its own personality. Lot of bright colors, all kinds of different tables, booths, and even the chairs few different ones so really nothing uniform or the same look around from any angle. The artwork (assume someone did) lot of Day of the Dead influence not that came as surprising since european melting pot of food. One artwork that thankfully my cousins pointed out they did Guy Fieri head with the show logo and his signature on the wall. Hell of cool! It literally feels like walking into another world once open the front door.  The food thankfully hanging out with the right peeps or Ohana this night. I got too try lot of the menu. We ordered decent amount of food for three of us. Six items in all. To go back to my earlier point reasonable price our bill was $60 before tip and we were stuffed. Two of us had drink so the bill would have been cheaper if not in the drinking mood. The HH price for drinks on all of them. Steal of deal. I stuck with beer but my cousin had one of the vodka drinks. I pass on trying but she told me was very tasty.   Home-made chicken soup was pleasantly surprised! We all thought ok on cold night get some soup. It might be bland your basic soup. Instead this little bowl packed bowl full of goodness. The broth was really tasty had depth, ample amount of shredded chicken in it, nice portion of vegetables, and really tasted like fresh Home-made soup. On chilly day could get super size bowl be soup Happy!  Stuffed Grape Leaves was really good. I really enjoyed the filling. The ground pork or assume pork had great seasoning and flavor. The sauce brought everything together along with the grape leaves.   Beef Stroganoff Ragu was another winnah. Again one of those dishes just give me super size plate be happy with one dish. The pasta dumplings was on point between the filling and the rich, thick, creamy, hearty stroganoff meat sauce. It heavy pasta dish but so good.  Spanish Rice (not sure forgot called) but talk about bowl of rice. It look more like paella without all the seafood or the saffron. It was popping with flavor. Not protein in it. Talk about flavors. It was really good rice.  The star of the show the one dish excited about Bulgarian Mixed Grill. Two dishes that was featured on the show. This was the one most looking forward too and past on the clay pot dish. Awesome. Not only the three different meats. I enjoy the three different sides. The beans and the red pepper something perfect compliment. If one dish NEED too order if first time, many times, or only time this is the one.   The only dish that not fan of was the Octopus in Olive Oil. Yay it has really nice depth of Olive Oil had the Octopus. Saying sometimes can have too much of good thing. Olive Oil was the killer for me. The rice that served with was bland not very good dish overall.  Outside of the one dish everything was awesome. All the food felt like had great depth of flavor. LOVE LOVE the atmosphere very much different then most restaurants in Vegas. Great spot to hang out with family or friends over drinks, some food, and weekend they even have live music. The service was fabulous. Looking forward too my next visit!!!",

My 19 yr old sister tripped....it was a laugh. She's fine. Haha. Anyway, my brother and i saw this on Triple D and realized this is literally across the street from where we live!! So the family and some friends went to try it out.  Everything was delicious, even the fresh baked bread they give you!! Put some oil on a plate and a sprinkle of the red powder they had on the table. I'm not sure what that was called. I wish I remember what the plates I ordered were called too, but I shall provide pictures. all I have to say is that everything was delicious, well cooked, and filling!!  It's about $8-$11 per plate from what I saw, but it's not a large portion. It's just enough. So I recommend this place to everyone! Oh, and the water was in a vodka bottle, so taking pics of my 11 yr old sister drinking her cup was fun to send to mom. Haha.   I can't wait to come back! :)",

    "text": "Holy cow! This place was great!  I had been wanting to try Forte for some time but put it off because it was a bit out of the way from me. After months of procrastinating I finally committed to having dinner here and I'm sure glad that I did.   First off the dining area was uniquely comfortable with what I can only describe as an Eastern European atmosphere/vibe. Pretty cool. I didn't catch our waitresses name but she was great! Friendly and helpful to us who are mostly unfamiliar with the cuisine.   My group ordered a handful of things but these are what stood out:  The Bacon Almond Dates: Unique flavor pairing but it worked. The bacon was the dominant taste IMO  Shopska Salad: Tasty fresh and light. Perfect balance for a salad dish. The tomatoes cucumbers and feta were a nice combo  Stuffed Grape Leaves: Loved them. Perfectly seasoned and the yogurt dill sauce was so good I sopped it up with the table bread (also great).  Thracian Clay Pot: Delicious. I broke the egg immediately and mixed it around with the sausage/tomatoes/peppers and it was the bomb. Really hot but after I let it cool the flavors packed into that little pot were terrific.   Bulgarian Mixed Grill: Not sure exactly what was in it (kind of like a rice meat and veg mixture) but it was another unique yet satisfying flavor combination. I had a hint of sweet that joined nicely with the otherwise savory dish.   Bulgarian Easter Lamb: Extremely tender meat with some tasty mashed potatoes and another light salad. Again full of flavor  Some of the soups and salads are vegan and vegetarian options for those interested. Definitely something I will look to try another time. Obviously I would recommend this restaurant to friends or anyone for that matter. It was a great experience",

    "text": "I arrived at Forte with high expectations after reading all the rave reviews from Yelpers I admire. The seating we chose wasn't the best, since the chairs weren't comfortable and the table too high. What we won't sacrifice for good lighting for our food pictures.   With a semi-large group of diners, we were able to sample a good number of menu items. We started with the house pita bread, which I didn't love. A little on the doughy side for my taste. We decided on a good sampling from the options on the menu and waited with anticipation.   As others have noted, the timing of our food didn't come out as spaced out as we would have liked and refills came only after a few reminders, I still enjoyed quite a bit about our meal here.   My favorites from lunch were the Calamares rellenos en su tinta, Thracian clay pot, sofiiska baniza, Chebureki and Adjarski khachapurri. I would return for any of these menu items in a heartbeat. My least favorite parts of the meal were the sugary sweet and drippy baklava, the overcooked and overly sweet almond stuffed dates and uninventive and incrediby generic-tasting Spanish chorizo chips. The Bulgarian lamb was just ok, I can't see myself ordering this again and the biscuit cake, although a favorite at our table was a little too dense and sweet-tasting for my particular palate.   I was on the fence on how many stars to give Forte, debating between 3 and 4 stars. Based on the number of items we ordered, I notice that the ones I didn't like outnumbered those that I did enjoy, but I would return to enjoy those few items I loved alone.",

    "text": "5 of us met again to try a new restaurant and try different food.  I have had Forte bookmarked for about 2 years but I never seemed to think of this place.    We were seated at two high top tables right as you come in the door.  While we were looking at the menu and talking about other things, we were approached for our order.  We asked her to wait awhile as we kept studying what we wanted.  We were soon brought some bread.  They were large round puffs larger and flatter than a doughnut.  There was olive oil on the table and we pulled pieces off the bread to dip in the oil.  It was good.  Our things started coming out.  The first plate was a shared Spanish \"nacho\" platter.  It consisted of some chips with thin chorizo slices and topped with a tasty truffle salsa.  We were brought two orders of meat pies that were also good.  Next came a dish stuffed baby squid served over Spanish herb rice.    We also ordered each of their specialty breads--a feta cheese stuffed filo dough round and Adjarski Khachapurri, described as traditional Georgian boat shaped bread filled with two types of Georgian styled pickled cheeses and a cracked egg mixed on top (after our photos).  Both were good breads.  It was difficult cutting the Georgian bread with the egg but we managed to mangle it enough that everyone got a chance to try some.  The filo round was easy.  All we had to do was pull a piece of the roll off and dip it in the sour cream if we wanted.  The bread was brought straight from the oven because it was extremely hot.  We had two orders of almond stuffed bacon wrapped dates with a sherry reduction.  The dates were OK but I thought they were cooked a bit too much.  Next came some Easter or spring lamb with some mashed potatoes and some salad.  I didn't think the lamb had much of the lamb flavor I was expecting and it was in a dark sauce.  I guess I'm too used to having lamb rare and not done in a stew manner.  It was extremely tender.  We closed out this part of lunch with the Thracian clay pot described on the menu as a \"traditional Bulgarian specialty of tomatoes, peppers, onion, feta, Bulgarian style charcuterie, and egg baked in a Bulgarian clay pot.  For me, this was the stand out of our lunch.  it had lots of flavor.  I used some of the spice on the table to give it some extra flavor.  On the table was a spice boat with a small wooden spoon.  The woman told us that it was a mixture of 40 spices with cumin, garlic, salt, and.....  We didn't ask her to continue.  Then dessert was ordered.  We got some baklava and their biscuit cake.  The biscuit cake was the star!  The menu describes it as \"decadent cake layered with honey biscuits, mascarpone, rich chocolate, Lavazza espresso, and a kick of spiced rum topped with walnuts and more chocolate.  Need I write any more?  The baklava was not like I'm used to in how it's made but it was OK.  I thought the food was pretty good.  I wanted to give the place more stars but the part that held me back was the service.  We had asked at the start not to bring all the dishes out but they just kept coming--not all at once--but close enough together that there wasn't a chance to rest a bit between tastings.  The number of plates and fitting them on our two tables became a bit of an issue.  Instead of giving us clean plates periodically, we had the same ones until the main courses were completed.  We got clean plates for dessert.  We also had to ask twice to get more water.  For such a small place with two servers at least, things should have been done better.    I might go back to try one of the other main dishes.  And of course, getting some more biscuit cake should always be foremost in my mind.  As always, good company made lunch a much better time!",

Certain drinks were $5 and a pitcher of Sangria $18. Also, a few appetizers on the menu were happy hour prices. We waited for a really long time before someone came over to take our drink and food order. When finally someone came over, I had asked what were the Happy Hour specials?  The waitress said they don't have happy hour and I had said, then why do you advertise it on your website. She said \"I don't know, but we don't have it anymore.\" She said that we can order something and she would give us a happy hour price, however she would not give us the pitcher of Sangria for a happy hour price. The food I would have to say is good, but very disappointed in the service and False advertising.",

    "text": "After many visits here I am thrilled to discover many delicious dishes from several regions around the world, along with a darn tasty spice blend, great atmosphere, and excellent service.  Everyone starts with house-made bread, the Bulgarian spice mix and olive oil.  The spice blend (15 herbs and spices) is for sale in cute jars for $6 each.  This is a great gift for friends or for yourself!  I have even used these spices to coat raw cashews (using coconut oil) which make for a great snack!  I have successfully shared the joy of Forte with friends, family, and other visitors alike, from vegetarian to carnivore.  Last night I learned that Forte could make Eric R. a fan of octopus, which he never enjoyed before.  My friends have really enjoyed the sausages made in house, but since I don't eat pork I am not able to tell you how they taste.  Dishes I have tried: Shopska Salad: basic salad covered in shredded Bulgarian feta.  Tasty but simple.  Fetamelon Salad: special in spring 2014. Huge portion of watermelon squares, Bulgarian feta, mint, and chopped red onion.  Very refreshing but needs people for sharing!  Calamares Rellenos en su Tinto: Stuffed squid marinated in its own ink on Spanish herb rice. Room temperate squid, tasty and different.  Octopus in Olive Oil: super tender octopous on top of warm rice with green onions, served with lemon.  Truly outstanding though simple, converted a non-octopus eater.  Beef and Lamb Confit: beef and lamb that melts in the mouth cooked in its own juices and fat on top of the Uzbeki Plov rice - I ordered the rice dish separately once with a veg friend but just get it here.  The meat juices coat the rice, which has dried cranberry and cornichons.  Love this dish!  Adjarski Khachapurri: bread boat with cheese topped with raw egg at table that cooks on the bread because it is so hot.  This is very delicious but hard to split, so at most 2 people should share one or it loses the fun.  Sooooo delicious.  Thracian Clay Pot: Peppers, tomato, onion, feta, and egg baked together (with sausage typically but I ordered one without, no problem).  Served in a beautiful traditional pot, though all serveware is Bulgarian.  This is topped with a serrano pepper for some nice heat!  Stuffed grape leaves: meat-filled and served warm with a delicious dill yogurt sauce.  Dip the homemade bread in the sauce after the dolmas are gone!  Beef stroganoff ragu: wild mushroom dumplings topped with a beef strogranoff ragu is one of Eric R.'s faves (he loves stroganoff in general).  Very rich sauce.  Vareniki: my favorite simple housemade dumplings stuffed with potato, topped with fried diced onions.  So good it converted 2 non-potato eaters!  Biscuit cake: dessert for David S.'s birthday.  Honey biscuits, mascarpone, walnuts, chocolate - tasty!  I would rather eat more savory food than sweets though if I had the option! :)  There is more for me to try but I never leave without flavors dancing in my palate.",

    "text": "I was so disappointed in this place! Went to Vegas with Bear and we went to this location because we wanted Tapas and it was fairly close to the strip. The place is dark and cozy and the service is pretty nice. But the food was terrible. Absolutely godawful.   We ordered the stroganoff on fries. The fries were great but the stroganoff was with ground beef and had a really thin broth like sauce which they had been very stingy with. Stroganoff usually comes with a creamy sauce and I thought they fries were gonna be covered with them but nah. Still this was the least terrible, can I say that? I don't want to say the best.   We ordered some sort of dumpling that came looking like a Pirozhki. The crust was nearly burnt, super crunchy and inside was just a very firm and rubbery meetball, no sauce, no seasoning, nothing.   We ordered the Lamb chop lollipop and we got two really big lamb chops, barely seasoned, the texture was all wrong.   We ordered the shrimp in garlic sauce. We got 5 pieces of hard rubbery shrimp, swimming in a sour lemon sauce.   Even though the dishes were very very small, we didn't finish a single one. We didn't finish the shrimp, the second dumpling was left untouched, the lamb chops we're left, the only thing we ate we're the fries. Never again!!",

    "text": "After reading an article about Forte in the newspaper, I checked the Yelp reviews.  Buoyed by those, mostly favorable, from my Yelp peeps, we had a go at it last night.  All I can say is \"Cada uno a su gusto,\" or for you gringos, to each his own.  My husband rated this a grudging two stars.  But I'm the reviewer, and I take his ratings solely under advisement.  My extra star is for the beautiful crockery and matching salt and pepper shakers, all available for purchase near the front.  No need to tell your mom the restaurant \"gifted\" you.  We arrived a little before 9 p.m., saw the sign \"Wait to be seated,\" so we waited.  And waited some more, until finally a server appeared an offered our choice of tables in the nearly-empty dining room.    The cocktail menu was lengthy, but perplexingly, only one single item had a price.  I didn't order it, but what made that one special?  Instead, I had a glass of sangria, described as fruity, and with the addition of Armagnac.  I like it when sangria is kicked up with more than just wine.  In this case, the fruit consisted of a slice of lemon.  There was no sweetness whatsoever, and the brandy was undetectable.  In short, it was a mere glass of red wine.  And I don't drink red wine, unless it's sangria, which this wasn't.  The confusion continued.  I had seen the Yelp photos.  The heralded Thracian Clay Pot was not listed under the tapas menu, so I assumed that it would be a dish that we could share.  We wanted it without the sausage, and our server said she preferred it that way.  We also shared an order of Varenicki.  The Varenicki looked like a very small portion, but I suppose it was adequate, since there turned out to be eight of them.  They were pretty tasty.  But when the server presented the clay pot, we were gobsmacked by the itty-bitty size.  I couldn't tell from the pictures that it was going to be so small.  She told us to be careful, that when we got to the middle it would be very spicy.  It didn't take much to find the single hot pepper; I like spicy, but not the seeds that scorch my esophagus, so after I removed it the dish had no spice at all.  None.  The combination of the tomatoes, pepper, and egg was decent, but nothing I would rave about.  I've made this at home a million times, though in my skillet instead of a pretty clay pot.  We probably should have realized from the price that it was not going to be a main course.  We would have, if the menu hadn't been so confusing, and if our server had given us a heads-up.  After that less-than-Dionysian feast, we could have ordered more.  But after the long initial wait, the disappointment with the sangria and the clay pot, and the fact that the kitchen was about to close, we determined that the holes in our stomach would be better filled with a trip to Yogurtland, and we parted ways with the charmingly decorated, but unfulfilling Forte.",

Offering a variety of cuisine from the European continent, but I settled for the Beef Stroganoff Ragu, not served over noodles, but pelmeni stuffed with mushrooms for $9.  Before the stroganoff arrived, the meal started with some moist house Russian bread with a side of extra virgin olive oil and some red spices, mostly made of paprika. The Russina wheat bread was great and eaten with the dressed up olive oil was bliss.   The Stroganoff was quite the treat. First of all, the ragu was very well made. It was thick and rich with a great flavor: a deep rich flavor that took time to develop, and some skill to make. Somebody had a great recipe hidden back there.  The pelmeni's mushrooms inside were tender, very well seasoned, and had a great natural flavor. Also, the pelmeni's itself, the shell, had a great chewiness in a very good way. No doubt they were cooked well. I'm telling you, I could of eaten a mountain of these.   I also tried tasters from a Bulgarian Mixed Grill which was quite good. Nataliya, the server was absolutely amazing. She not only was very well verse in Forte's cuisine and its individual preparations, but she reserved extreme patience. She was very prompt and always had a great smile on her face.  If you are looking for something different and great, check this place out.",

It's fun taking new people here to try it, especially people from out of town so they can see all the different foods Vegas has to offer.  Of course, Forte was featured on DDD, so that's always a sign of a great place.    Everything on the menu is great.  My personal favorites are the Bulgarian Easter Lamb, Lamb Chop Lollipops, the Bulgarian Mixed Grill, the Thracian Clay Pot, and any of the salads.  The Black True Caviar with Truffle Salami Flatbread is awesome, but they don't offer it anymore.  I wasn't really a fan of the Russian dishes, but my wife loved the dumplings since they reminded her of the Ukrainian neighborhood in Chicago.  I wasn't really a fan, but I liked the Perogies we tried when we were in Poland.  With that comparison, I still didn't like the dumplings at Forte, but I'll take my wife's word for it that they are good as related to Russian ones.    The servers are always nice and friendly.  The restaurant recently remodeled, so it is a bit more comfortable.  The music is like being in Eastern Europe with the eletronica, but it's not too loud.  The service is a bit on the slow side, so don't go here if you're in a hurry.  You might want to look at the menu ahead of time to put in a food order with your drink order since it might take a bit of time for the server to return to take your food order.",

You'll definitely find foods that are very unique compared to other usual fare. Every item I have tried is delicious and seasoned well.

I hate complaining but I mean, fucking lamb chops... the waitress tells me she'll order me another one but the cooks are Bulgarian & they'll prolly come back the same way.  I can't even begin to comprehend...   However, everything else was pretty good. Staff was super friendly and three of them spoke Bulgarian. The zagorka was a fantastic Bulgarian beer In other words don't let me keep you from trying it but I mean... you can only get your lamb chops well done?!?!?!?!?   I can't even",

    "text": "We originally discovered Forte on an episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives featuring their Thracian Clay Pot-we immediately fell in love and make it ourselves almost weekly. If you haven't seen it...check it out their traditional Bulgarian dish here: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.barforte.com%2F&s=5a92e9a1bad89836bb8e290f9238a8a0d0926bc93bc5c17c8bdc674a99513825\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">barforte.com</a>   When we found ourselves in Vegas a few months later, we decided we needed to try it in person despite a)being about a 20 minute drive from the strip b) being located in a strip mall....not my ideal locale for a nice dinner.   The two of us arrived without a reservation, which wasn't a problem at our time of arrival for a Saturday evening. There is a small outdoor fenced in patio area, but we opted to sit inside instead. The place is seriously cute. Great, cheeky decor, mismatched tables, clusters of seating, a bar area, fun wine cellar, chalkboard walls with specials, etc. We were brought fresh, warm, house baked bread in a turquoise colander with our menus. The bread is accompanied by their own spices and oils. Water is served in old fashioned vodka bottles with seriously awesome labeling.   Our server was the absolute sweetest (and absolutely gorgeous!) and we put our Thracian Clay Pot order in right away-they take about 25-30 minutes. ($9.99 but we got it on some happy hour special for just $6!)  We ordered the stuffed sweet peppers to start-and WOW, we were surprised. They were delicious with the yogurt dill sauce and we scraped up the last of it with our warm bread. ($6.95)  We also tried the lamb lollipop fries ($9.99) which were a special for that night. The lamb chops were on a bed of amazing fries and gravy sauce.   We tried the Pelmeni beef dumplings which were also good.  We had the Adjurski Khachapurri-the only thing I wouldn't give a 5 star. It is a bread dish in the shape of a boat stuffed with pickled Bulgarian cheese and topped with a cracked egg. This menu item is listed as \"finished table side\" although all she really did was break up the over easy egg and mix it. This was a good dish, but much more suitable for breakfast or brunch, rather than dinner.   We tried traditional Bulgarian beer, Argentinian wine (Gascon!), and even the Moscow mule-house infused ginger vodka, limes, and ginger beer in a copper mug. One of my favorites!  The best part is that Forte is extremely affordable. For two people who ordered 5 items and 5 drinks total, our bill was around $60-unheard of!  Get off the strip and check this place out! They open at 5 pm have live music starting around 8 pm. A definite favorite of our trip!",

Great place to hang out with friends and enjoy the food. Try the infused vodkas in the strange jars. Try the gypsy juice!  A bit divey but very cool",

    "text": "Another tip from the safety girl.  You need to walk through the patio to get into this place.  The patio is too crowded with tables and umbrellas and you will need to step over the base of a very large umbrella to get across the patio and into the restaurant.  Be careful not to trip!  Ok, now that we have our safety tip out of the way, onto the restaurant.  There's a small bar towards the back with old school video poker machines along the wall.  Not at the bar.  It's more like the video poker set up you would see in a grocery store.  Lots of smokers in this area.  Interesting music videos on the TV screens.  Don't expect sports here.  We came on a Friday night and there was one waitress so service was pretty slow.  We tried the mixed tapas plate, which was just olives, garlic cloves, cheese, salumi, and bread.  Nothing exciting.  The Thracian with Lukanka was to die for.  Sausage, feta cheese, vegetables all cooked in a clay pot.  We had to ask for more bread to go with it and it took a while, but once we could dig in it was pretty good!  The blini with meat was also pretty good.  It's a thin crepe with ground beef served with sour cream.  Simple but good.    The portion sizes are big enough to share but small enough so you can try multiple dishes.    I liked most of the dishes but it took forever to eat here and I'm not grasping the ambience.  Maybe I am not European enough but, then again, I'm pretty sure grocery store video poker machines are not European. Still, looking forward to giving it another try.",

First of all the atmosphere is unique.  It looks like someone bought a whole bunch of furniture from a garage sale and threw it in the space.  The chairs with the tables really don't work if you are trying to sit down and have a meal.   There was only one server working the lunch crowd so service was super slow.  When she finally got around to us, she dropped off a bottle of vodka, what I thought,  to the table.  It was actually an old vodka bottle that they reuse to fill with water.  A little alarming to me as I'm not sure what health code allows but this was odd.   The server also dropped off a stale basket of bread in which they toast to hide the fact the bread was old.  Even my husband who is from Europe didn't even it.    I ordered a mediterranean salad and the chicken shish kabob.  My husband had the borsht and the lescovacka pljeskavica.  Apparently, the borsht was not very good but the lescovacka was edible.  The flavors were to be somewhat desired in my opinion.  I barely touched my food and the server never even asked if everything was okay when she took it away.   Based upon my experience, my husband and I will never come back.  I recommend to go elsewhere as this place is not worth the money.",

The bread and olive oil is a great starter; the fries with feta are delish, but I love the crusty pastry with the egg and cheese filling best-Adjarski Khachapurri. It's like the most wonderful personal fondue.  Oddly enough- the truffled mashed potatoes are also out of this world.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the charred onions on the pierogis- I love onions but these were a little too burnt each time I ordered the dish.",

    "text": "Just went here for lunch.  SLLOOOW but friendly service, my feeling is they keep a very bare bones staff, at least for lunch that is. Nina herself seated us, ask if we wanted water but never got it.  While does the restaurant just opened at noon, I noticed that not one of the 8 people seated when we got there  had any food or drinks and it was 12:30 pm when we arrived.   It basically took about 10 minutes for the waiter to ask us if we wanted anything to drink, and another 10 to bring us the drinks.  We realized that since we were hungry we better order our food with our drinks.   We ordered: Sofiiska baniza- My husband order this, which is filo with cheese...looks lovely, but it didn't look like light layery filo though, more like a bit too doughy.  My husband said it was dense and just \"fine\". (I don't eat starches.)   Octopus over rice from the tapas menu.  The octopus was fishy for me, but the rice was nicely cooked, according to my husband.   Mixed grill- It was very good, one of the sausage links was cooked way more than I like, almost dry, but maybe that is the way it is suppose to be.  Still tasty. The patty seasoning was assertive, but not overpowering.  I liked the red pepper condiment and the onions marinated with mint that come with the mixed grill, it also comes with beans which we didn't eat, but looked appealing.   It really is a good portion size, especially for the price.  Thoracian Clay pot- By this time, we were pretty full, but we loved this and ate it all, but  it reminded me of a great breakfast dish that could easily be made at home, because the little clay pot had sauteed tomato, onions, bell peppers, feta, a few slices of charcuterie, and what probably should be a baked egg with an oozy yolk, but our yolk was cooked through. Still it was delicious. However, that little tasty claypot maybe way too small of a portion to satisfy a very hungry person if this is all one orders.    You can tell almost everyone in the restaurant that this was their first time.  I guess inspired by DDD.  Yes, sadly and quite embarrassingly, I saw it too and wanted to go.  While I am not above them, I think the \"foodie\" want-a-bes were pretty annoying...one actually playing the DDD episode on his phone, and two old but very plump ladies asking annoying (stupid) questions to the waiter about the owner and trying to get EXACTLY same menu as on that episode of DDD...as if it was a tasting menu.    Cool environment though, better if I just want to hang out, relax and have a few drinks at a VEEERRY leisurely pace.  I am glad I gave it a try, but probably won't go back, definitely not for lunch.    My advice: definitely try this place out, but don't go here for a \"quick\" lunch on your lunch hour.",

    "text": "We had been here on two occasions and were ok with the experience and food.  Service was always slow they seemed under staffed but the flavors and food seemed worth the wait.  So much so, that we invited friends to join us for an early Saturday evening meal.  When we arrived the hostess was visibly upset we were there and said, \"You have reservation?\"  We said no and that if there were fully booked that was ok we could go elsewhere.  We weren't upset just confused the place had only one couple sitting there and it was 4:30pm.  We assumed maybe they were expecting a large party.  The hostess asked another girl about seating us and both rolled their eyes and acted like they were doing us a favor finding a table.  No greeting, no customer service, just attitude.  It was disappointing.  I get it, it's a European feel and they were on the Food Channel, but don't let it go to your heads folks, this is Vegas and there are plenty of fish in the sea so to speak.  If this was all that occurred I would have been more generous with my rating but it got worse.  We ordered simple items, lentil soups and salads that took 45 - 60 minutes to arrive.  My only item, lentil soup came 30 minutes after everyone else was served.  When we asked the hostess who was now our waitress about the wait on the soup she said it was on its way then waited 20 more minutes.  The soup arrived and tasted ok but wasn't as good as previous times.  It tasted a little strange but after the wait I was starving.  Later on our way home I felt sick and spent the better part of the my night in the bathroom.  The entire time we were there the place never had more than a few tables of people, so we never figured out what the challenge was with seating our small group of 5.  If you alright waiting an excessive amount of time for simple food, being disrespected by staff who present as having a chip on their shoulder, and spending your night sick to your stomach, enjoy Forte; otherwise I would recommend many of the other dining establishments in our fair city that value one's patronage and health.  If this were my hot spot, I would be looking in to hiring staff that value customers and ensure my staff prepare and serve my food in a timely manner.  After your location is on TV people have a certain expectation for service and if that is not met because you fail to have a consistent deliverable your establishment will not remain viable in our market.",

The owner is Bulgarian, not Spanish or Ukrainian, so try the Bulgarian spring lamb (even in winter) which was fantastic, the Shopska salad was better than the one I make (as my husband later informed me)...and the cheese banitza was worth the 20-minute wait. My Bulgarian mixed grill was the best. I do wish they would bring back the homemade bread they used to serve and I would say that on my two visits last week the service was very slow. That said, I can't wait to make it back.",

We took the recommendation from our server and got the Serbian Mixed Grill (which was a sumptuous festival of sausages!!) and the Bulgarian Easter Lamb that Hubby said was the best Lamb he had ever had!!

If you want something different, then drive or Uber it over to Forte.  There are things on the menu that I've never seen elsewhere.  Yeah, the service is a little slow, but then again no one is rushing you out the door.    We showed up at 7:30 on a Wednesday for dinner.  Unfortunately, I went overboard with the delicious bread and even more delicious olive oil dip.  There is a container of spices at each table.  You pour some olive oil into a plate and sprinkle some of the spices on top before dipping your bread.  I don't know what combination of spices are used, but it was an entirely new taste sensation.  We started with the sofiiska baniza (feta cheese rolled in filo dough) that was a bargain at $7.  We also ordered the stuffed dates.  The jerez sherry reduction drizzled over them was perfect.  Lea had the beef and lamb confit and I ordered the bulgarian mixed grill,  Both were great, though after all that bread I couldn't finish the last piece of sausage.  We decided to stop for lunch on our way out of town two days later.  This time, I controlled my bread intake.  Once again, we ordered the dates and each had the beef and lamb confit.  Absolutely delicious.  Before leaving, we bought a jar of the spices.  If you're in Vegas, it's well worth the cab fare to enjoy a meal at Forte.",

The owner is pretty good looking, and the female server at our table was also strangely hot, in a very European way.   The menu is full of dishes that I can't and won't even try to pronounce, but I dare say that most meat lovers will like their Mixed Grill. The meat was well seasoned and very tasty. Almost felt like I was in Eastern Europe, but without the death metal heads and bad Jason Bourne Villains.   The bread dish with the egg cracked right in the middle is good too, for all you carbo lovers out there. Prices are way cheap, making this a great destination for foodies in Vegas. HInt- if you want to know what Guy ordered they have little icons in the shape of his head next the dishes.",

    "text": "Man, I am hating to have to give this place only 3 stars, based on food quality and prices, this place is easily 5 stars, but we had some weird service related issues that tipped the scales ...  1. It was hot and stuffy inside the restaurant so we asked our waitress if she could prop open a nearby door. The door was locked but it had a sign on it that read 'Must remain unlocked during business hours' so then our waitress just said 'no that door is locked' and even though we pointed at the sign, she made no attempt to fix the situation, it was pretty rude.  2. After we ate the hostess called us 2 cabs, but only one showed up, and since this restaurant is far off the strip, cabs are essential. So when we tried to go back into the restaurant to arrange another cab, it was locked! They locked us out!!! The restaurant wasn't supposed to close for another hour, sheesh, it was a cold night.  Anyways  ... on to the food:  The grill plate is outstanding, the sausages are dry and firmer that what you may be used to but they are full of flavor. The stroganoff was everyone's favorite, the dumplings were amazing and the sauce of delicious. The claypot was a big disappointment, all the ingredients individually were great but together they did not mesh well.  The egg bread is a must, not because it's so tasty but because it's a unique dish. Overall excellent food, reasonable prices, but sketchy service.",
