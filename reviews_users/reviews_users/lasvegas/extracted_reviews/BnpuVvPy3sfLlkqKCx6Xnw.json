We had to ask 4 times for Ketchup and Butter. The biscuits and gravy were cold so we informed who I to believe was the Manager, he promptly replaced our biscuits. Insisted that they were hot and cautioned us but they were only luke warm. Even the check was miss calculated we had to wait for the cashier to talk to the waiter to figure out why we were over charged. It was upsetting being I traveled out of my way to go there only be disappointed. To top it all of the next morning I woke up with stomach pains I believe it was that luke warm biscuit. I won't be going back ever. And until they get it together I suggest you avoid it too.",

    "text": "Seems to be a popular place. We went in for breakfast around 8am on a Sunday. There was only a few tables left and by the time we left, there was a line outside waiting for tables.  Our server was cordial but did take a bit longer than I would have liked to come to our table. However, they did have a pre-server server come by almost immediately to take our drink order, nice touch.  I had the eggs Benedict and they were okay. The hollandaise sauce had a stronger flavor than I liked, not sure if it was too much lemon juice, pepper or if they added mustard to it. Either way, I scraped some of it off so not to ruin the overall flavor for my taste. The eggs were done correctly and the hash browns were tasty.  The guy with me ordered a side of sausage patties which consisted of 4 patties. Seemed like a good plate to order if you had a couple of people to share with. More than enough for one. They might want to consider just giving two of them and cutting the price in half to avoid the waste.  Nice, clean place, decent pricing and good food. Probably a good place to go if you're not in a hurry to eat and run. Enjoy!",

    "text": "My wife and I were staying at the Red Rock and we tried to get reservations at the two expensive restaurants.  We were actually able to get reservations at one of them, but while walking through the casino, we decided that the grand cafe looked pretty good.  It was nice inside and they had their menu out front and it looked really good!   So I cancelled the reservation I had and we went for it!    I had the prime rib.  It was Vegas sized for sure!  Huge! Cooked to a perfect medium rare with tasty au jus sauce.  I got a loaded baked potato with it.  It was perfectly cooked. Soft.  Juicy. Melt in your mouth prime rib!  The baked potato was actually baked golden brown.  It came with butter, sour cream and chives.  There were also vegetables, but I was on vacation- so NO VEGETABLES!  But they were steamed and - you know....boring vegetables.   My wife got the filet Mignon.  It came with a mushroom gravy and was very flavorful.  She got the roasted garlic mashed potatoes and was excited to find out that it came with a roasted tomato.   There were also some skinny asparagus on top of the mashed potatoes.  Good stuff.  She loved her meal.    They had a dessert counter that was kind of on the way out.  The grand cafe didn't actually offer desert, because I think they want you to buy a dessert from the counter on the way out.   They did however bring me an espresso and added it on to my bill, so that was cool.  But kind of a drag that they didn't have dessert.     This place didn't quite have the ambiance that the incredibly expensive restaurants had across the casino, but it was absolutely delicious and we spent a fraction of the price.",

She puts in a BLTA sandwich with no brownie and wants to swipe my card again for a whole other amount. I said \"no, I'm not being charged twice again. Just give me the sandwich. So Rebecca, the server, starts going on about how the sandwich won't have any bacon. Why in the hell would I want a BLT sandwich with just lettuce and tomato? Oh that's right this isn't even the order I gave to you nor was it the order I repeated back. The manager comes over to be rude as hell. I'm cool on eating there especially when I'm treated as if I messed something up when I literally gave my order, paid, and Rebecca messed it up on her side by not simply paying attention to what she was doing.  I just cancelled my order so I have yet another charge from your establishment on my card that I have to have removed if your \"void\" never happens, which is a hassle.  I've dealt with mischargings from your food establishment 3x already! Once a server added a $15.00 tip to my $25.00 to go order and I had to call that in. I'm randomly charged a $2.50 service fee depending on.... I'm not really sure what determines why I'm sometimes charged the fee and sometimes not. The customer service at The Grand Cafe sucks. Please look at what you are doing at the register before swiping someone's card!!",

On the bright side, the food is fantastic and is a great value.  I have eaten there many times and I've always had a good meal. Most recently I ordered the prime rib. The hunk of meat was so large it could probably feed  four people.  I ordered the meat rare, and it was exactly what I got.  The meat was tender and juicy, I thoroughly enjoyed the small amount I was able to eat. It came with a baked potato and vegetables which I never touched.  My companion had breakfast at 10 PM and she said it was pretty adequate, it looked beautiful on the plate. Her main complaint was that the toast was not toasted, and the bacon could've been crispier. Her eggs were cooked perfectly. She ordered them soft scrambled, and they were perfect which is amazing if you have ever ordered soft scrambled eggs anywhere.    They offer $10 or less specials every night of the week. As I stated before it's a good value stop in and have a bite, you'll enjoy it!",

Wife had to send eggs Benedict back because the eggs were way over cooked, even though I specifically asked for lightly poached. She never even apologized.

    "text": "Went here at 2 in the morning with my fam and some Yelp peeps after just getting done with our bowling UYE.  Already I have a bad first impression because as soon as the hostess saw there was about 12 of us, she told us it was gonna be about half an hour before we can get a table. As I looked around, it didn't seem like they were busy at all. I would say overall you had about 8 tables of customers being tended to. The feeling I was getting was that the hostess didn't really wanna be there.  So after about 35 minutes we finally got to sit down. It took about 10 minutes before our server came to get our order. We were all actually ready with our orders but she said she was gonna take our drink order first and to put that in. That's stupid. We already had 10 minutes to go over the menu and decide what we want but yet she insisted on getting our drink orders first.   So she brings our drinks out after about another 10 minutes. We give her our order and off she went. What happened next almost made me walk out. It took 30 minutes, yes, 30 MINUTES for her to bring out our food. She could have refilled my soda at least twice in that time frame and for your information she never did. So by the time we got our food, it was just a little after 3 am.  I know what you're thinking. Since we had a party of 12, of course its natural that making that much food will take a while. Only thing was that all the food we ordered was off the graveyard special menu, meaning pancakes, eggs, biscuits and gravy, etc. So all the items we ordered were simple and quick things to make.  The first couple times I ate here around the same time, it was decent. This third time, I am now convinced not to eat here any more. It seemed everybody's attitude that worked there was like they did not wanna be there. If you don't like your job, find something else. We as a party did not demand anything special or were rude in our interactions. Even the manager I spoke to said it was usually slow around that time. I think he didn't wanna be there either.   So in closing, just because they are 24 hours and they have graveyard specials, that doesn't always translate to great service and great food. For this place, the food is decent but the really bad service gives you a bitter taste in your mouth. I recommend going to Fatburger in the food court. They are 24 hours as well but I guarantee you wont have to wait an hour to get your food.",

Well that all changed when something like a new manager took over and the service really went down the tube.  Waiting is part of the requirement to get in this place not because its crowded but because the service really sucks and are supper slow.  I've seen a lot of people go through the employment line to work here and it seems the requirement is slowness is a must.  We don't patron this place any more because it's not the \"Five Start Quality\" that it claims to be.  Service is extremely slow and the taste of the Prime is in the toilet.  Now we gotta find a new place to eat Prime. The buffet is another example of \"losing it\" mentality.  Serving the same thing day in, day out, does not make for a good eatery.   In the meat section - steaks, prime, turkey for example are so dry you know you're in the dessert.  Italian-Not so good when the marinara sauce is so bland you don't want to eat.  Asia-same dish every time we go and not really good to look at.  Mexican - I have never tried this section because it sure doesn't look good.  Salad Bar is so scarce of veggies makes you not want to try it.  Its the smallest salad bar I've seen in a casino.   Cost must be the big deal in here because it is all misered down tremendously.  Only real good thing here in the buffet is the workers - very friendly and courtesy.  Noodle Shop-very pricey but they do have one of the best tasting Pad Thai eats in town.  Everything else is so costly, its like they want to break your bank and cause you to go bankrupt. Gotta keep looking for some really good grinds.",

Customer service was okay but had to wait to just order because I couldn't find my players card and to order a graveyard special you need to have one.

Well, almost everything, except for Grand Cafe.  Like it's weaker sister location at the Green Valley Ranch (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/green-valley-ranch-resort-and-spa-henderson-2\">yelp.com/biz/green-valle...</a>), Grand Cafe is the lowest end of the dining totem pole.  Yes, even lower than FatBurger and most other chains in the resort, because at the very least even they can consistently crank out tolerable food.  Couple that with some other major service snafus and it's not hard to see this cafe is already on the downward spiral.  Since Grand Cafe is 24 hours, it's typically the source for room service food.  If you're going to order for your room, you should save the trouble and try another casino dining establishment instead - your stomach and your wallet will thank you.  Service has always been lackluster at best.  My many visits here both late night and early morning have been with wait staff who seem more apathetic than not.  It might just be my bad luck but I've lost count from how many service related issues I've had with my food.  Management needs to start hiring from the same pool of folks that are staffed in other establishments or the quality will continue to suffer.  And with regards to the quality of the food, something is almost always off.  Breakfast foods have been bland and dry, salads have been uninspiring, even burgers and sandwiches were disappointing.  Casual dining isn't supposed to be this hard.  To offer any suggestions outside of getting a new kitchen and wait staff may prove to be too difficult.  But they could certainly use the help.  One of these days if they cook an egg or even a proper burger, we can revisit the idea of trying Bland (not Grand) Cafe.",

Coffee was in carafe this time and we poured it ourselves.   Better service and food at Egg Works or Blueberry Hill.  Trying to get a water refill. Manager helping to clean table next to us...water glass on edge of table. After six minutes server FINALLY asks if everything is OK. I respond clearly not while pointing at the empty water glass. He asked if I wanted a refill.  Could learn a ton from Pantry at The Mirage, the best breakfast in Las Vegas is at Pantry.  Water empty again. It is not that busy. Seven minutes. Now we only want to pay the bill and leave.  Very disappointed. Grand Cafe at Green Valley Ranch is significantly better.",

Had a great dinner that evening at the New Mexican restaurant.  The next day, it couldn't have gone more south.  We were seated very quickly which was a plus, but that is where it ends.  Took approximately 10 minutes to even get a hello.  Water took even longer to get.  After placing our order, we received our lunch 40 minutes later.  Saw many employees standing around chatting.  After delivering the meals one of our guests was told they were out of coleslaw so they decided to give her the French Fries instead.  No other options, apparently.  This was noon.  Out of coleslaw so soon?   The person who delivered the meals left the empty soup bowls on the table.  He had a tray.... Why not go back with something on the \"said\" tray.   I placed the soup bowls on the ledge above where we sat and they finally were removed 15 minutes later.  Had to ask for more water as the glasses were empty.   Terrible service, not so great food equals we will never be back.",

    "text": "I dined here for the first time last night and I must say the restaurant ambiance is rather impressive for a 24 hr cafe.  I started with a side salad and then ordered the roasted herb chicken dinner with streamed veggies and a baked potato.   The salad was good, except it was 100% iceberg lettuce.  It would have been nice to have a spring mix or something.  It was a bit like a Denny's salad.  The chicken was very good and the 1/2 chicken was a larger bird, so it was a good sized meal.  The veggies were tasty and the baked potato was a bit dry, but OK.   The ambiance is very nice and service was good, but not outstanding.  My wine glass was empty the server never asked if I wanted another glass. Hello, it's Vegas and dinner time....one glass?  really?    The wine serving size was kind of small, but I would have ordered a 2nd glass if offered.  I like this place and it sure beats standing in the super long line for buffet or dining at the fast food court.   The bar area looks cool and I'll try that on my next visit.  Maybe I can get a refill on my drink there. lol  3.5 Stars.",

This was my third time dining at the RedRock GC and it seems pretty consistent. Of course if you are lucky enough to be in Roberto's section, which I have been all 3 times, you experiences will be anything but ordinary. If you aren't having a good morning Roberto will make sure that changes and he'll definitely put a smile on your face.  As far as Grand Cafe food goes, they have a nice selection on their menu with many healthy options. The food always taste fresh and prepared nicely. Not much more you can say about a typical breakfast.",

For the amount of cash that my brother and I throw around (thankfully this is only a couple times a year), we end up with comps to various joints in the casinos.  Enter the Red Rock.  I end up not wanting to deal with haggling with a floor boss and opted to just get a quick brunch meal for The Wife and I.  I ordered the tuscan salad and clam chowder while getting french toast for The Wife.  Overall, not bad.  Not great either.  Geoff, the bartender, did chat me up a bit while I was waiting on the chow but otherwise it was a rather unremarkable experience.",

    "text": "As I was driving to Red Rock, I was thinking of the hierarchy of rocks in our society.  Pet Rock, Third Rock From The Sun, Rock 'n' Roll, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, 30 Rock . . .  Where would Red Rock rank?  Would it, pardon the pun, rock my world?  Grand Cafe at Red Rock is everything one could want in a Vegas cafe and a lot more.  We came here last Monday around 8:30 am and were seated right away.  The hostess was very friendly, and she managed to strike up a conversation with while showing us to our spacious booth.  We walked by the pastry counter, which, as you might imagine, was NOT easy to do.  Tantalizing chocolate covered strawberries, delicious sticky buns and cavity-causing candied apples taunted us as we pretended not to notice the sweets.  As soon as we sat down, our waitress brought an iced tea for my friend and a stainless steel carafe of hot coffee for me.  Score!  The coffee was delicious, by the way.  Unlimited, readily available coffee and a steady supply of Splenda make Yan a happy boy.  I ordered a ham platter (ham steak, 2 scrambled eggs, hash browns and wheat toast) for $8.99.  We also decided to split a short stack of pancakes, which, in retrospect, was a fantastic idea.  The two pancakes they brought us were doughy, fluffy, delicious and very, very filling.  One a person was plenty.  The ham steak was almost as big as the pancakes, and almost just as good.  My scrambled eggs were made perfectly as well.  There was nothing wrong with that breakfast, let me tell ya.    I have to mention the decor.  The whole restaurant, much like the casino itself, featured a modern, abstract motif.  Lines, squares, soothing colors and \"weird for the sake of weird\" paintings somehow made me feel at peace.  I also LOVED the plates they used.  Ornate yet simple, they reminded me of the plates my mom used to use when I was a little kid.  I got a sudden urge to clear the table after dinner, but I figured they had people for that.  If you're staying at the Red Rock, I strongly recommend having breakfast at Grand Cafe.  It's convenient, inexpensive and homey.",

Then Someone finally comes and talks to you and they take your drink order and tell you they are not your waitress so you have to wait longer to actually place a meal order. I came here a second time because it's in the hotel and I was desperate. Last night the same thing happened and while my table \"stuck it out\" another group left very angry for the same treatment and as they were leaving the manager made a nasty comment loud enough for me to hear it 10 feet away like a 2 year old but not loud enough for the guest to hear....     This place had maybe 10 tables of groups of 2-4 people and they had at least 3 waitresses and nobody was getting helped. I looked around and noticed all of the people looking around confused as I was wondering what the problem was.    This place is so bad I'm writing my first negative review after being on yelp for months. Do yourself a favor if you are staying at the red rock and eat somewhere else that kills the beef while you wait for faster service. I'm giving it one star because yelp won't let me give zero stars.     All kidding aside, tonight even if I'm hungry for a late night snak, I'm getting dressed and driving around in search of a coffie shop or fast food.Even if I have to drive to the strip which is a distance away, I'm sure to get my food quicker.",

    "text": "Eck!  That's one word to describe this place.  At 11am (check out time), there was about a 30 minute wait.  Our waitress was apparently too good to bring water because she only brought the drinks other than water.  For my family who was majorly hung-over and in desperate need of hydration...this was not a good thing.  When she did bring our drinks, she didn't bother to take our order.  Another 5-10 minutes pass and she finally takes our order.  The water came via bus-lady about 5 minutes after that.  The food took forever too.  I didn't time it, but it had to be at least 20 minutes.  My mushroom, spinach, Swiss cheese (on top instead of inside), and I added ham, omelet......was mostly egg and spinach....I barely saw/tasted any mushrooms or ham.  For $9, this plate was served with hash browns and choice of bread.  The apple juice was SO sweet I had to add half my water to it.    The menu is a wide variety of breakfast items, sandwiches, dinner entrees and even Asian Cuisine.  My cousin got the Emperor's Won-Ton Soup which was full of won-tons, bbq pork, veggies, shrimp........and bland flavor.  Remember, you are in Vegas, not SG.   The waitress did come back to check on us a couple times, but it was already too late to win more stars from me since the food took too long.  Breakfast for 4 cost about $50...not too bad considering you're in a casino.  But the low prices reflect the poor service and poor food.    Don't eat here unless you have no choice.  I'm not giving them 1 star because I can imagine worse things happening at a restaurant.  I'll save my 1 stars for them.",

And both times I felt like I wasted time and calories coming to this stupid place. If you're staying at Red Rock and you want a place to eat don't come to this joint. Instead, check out Yardhouse,  the mexican restaurant, the food court, buffet or march your happy ass across the street to BJs.",

My wife ordered a Turkey Club, which was not bad, according to her, though somewhat salty.  A friend ordered a prime rib that he just devoured and I ordered fish tacos.    So I get my three fish tacos and they are okay, but they are about the size of a deck of cards.  Very small.  With no sides that come with it.  Quite disappointing and certainly not worth the money.

We have tried many times to no avail.    From a burnt burger on a stale bun to a chicken croquette right our of the frozen food box with cold gel for gravy.  I did have a good Tuscan salad ONCE.  The next two times I ordered it, items were missing and I had to beg for more dressing. The staff here is complacent, rude and act like they are doing you a BIG favor just by standing around.  They move at a snail's pace.  One exception is if you eat at the bar - there is one bartender that stands out on nights.  (Now, that WAS over a year ago-so not sure if he is still there.) Management staff really sets the tone here and if you complain, forget about it!  We stayed away for over a year and decided to try it again.  While waiting (no line, not busy) for someone to seat us, I mentioned to the manager standing next to us that we always found the service slow, and had been away for over a year, chosing the food court over her restaurant.  She sharply said, \"Well, you came back didn't you?\"  I said, \"Yes, and now that I am here, I see nothing has changed, so why try again!\".  We promptly left.  Living nearby, we are often asked about restaurants in the area.  I have told well over 100 family, friends and, business associates to NEVER eat here.  One business associate staying there said she had no choice and tried it - she agreed it was one of the worst dining experiences she has had.

I order a regular eggs benedict, but when the waiter brings it out, it's missing the hollandaise sauce, WTF?? So, he goes back to the kitchen and brings me some [cold] hollandaise sauce in a small bowl. Silverware was dirty too - I had to ask him twice to bring me a new set. I hate to criticize people, but this guys mind was like a blackboard that kept getting erased - as soon as he walked away from the table, he would completely forget what we requested. Now I'm finished with my meal and ask for some water. Guess what - he forgot again. After 10 minutes, I end up asking another waitress to tell the guy to bring me my water.

Also, by the time I would get fresh fruit, eggs, and coffee, it came out to be a very expensive breakfast. Then we tried the buffet at Red Rock. Now, I'm not one for buffets, however for breakfast this one can't be beat.

They were chunks of chicken breast, grilled, and really wasn't what I was expecting (like from PF Changs or Cheesecake Factory), but they were good.....and healthy.  That turkey club though......HUGE!  And, it was jam-packed full of turkey and bacon.  I got it with a side of potato salad.  I ate half of the sandwich and was stuffed.  I ended up getting 3 meals out of that sandwich and potato salad.  Definitely a thumbs up for me!",

I went with the $4 specials including 2 sausage links, scrambled eggs and 1 piece of toast. We also shared the French toast. For $4, I wasn't expecting much but I was NOT impressed. The scrambled eggs were soo runny - barf. The sausage was decent but super greasy and the toast was...toast. The French Toast was good! Should have just stuck with that. Probably would not return.",

What's the point in offering this menu late night if it has restrictions.  I ended up ordering a burger that was OK, it was almost like a old fashioned A&W burger. The fries were a little odd I  taste and came in some weird metal basket that was placed on the plate. My wife had nachos that were unlike any I have ever had. The best thing was the chips, as for the rest it was some kind of frankingstine creation of bean paste and other things that couldn't be determined.  They were all rather one note of gritty bean past and nothing else.  The service was the only bright spot here.",

Denver Omelet , lox bagel last time were good. I would say the cream cheese that came out for me to spread on my bagel was cold so really hard to spread and the bagel was a little too toasty but I was hungry so I wasn't about to send it back.   The server was very nice this last time. However it seems like there may be a management issue since the service at this place is always mediocre at best. We sat down and ordered a mimosa and waited for 25 minutes. Our food came at the same time as the mimosa which was not the servers fault. The bartender was not even be hind the bar 1 & 2 you should probably have more than one bartender helping if you have that many servers on the floor.   The service always seems to lag but the food is good enough and I enjoy playing keno and going to the Red Rock.",

We decided weeks ago not to dine at the Cafe except for breakfast (their a.m. special is really good except toast comes unbuttered now), but my partner was salivating over his last big burger there with cheese dripping over the sides & on a Brioche bun.  Whoops!  Not so any longer.  This $5.99 special is now a thin patty with no drippy cheese & shredded lettuce smothering it, but does sit atop that Brioche bun.  I ordered the fish & chips special & was shocked to find 2 thin pieces of over-breaded fish & decided Gorton's fish sticks were way better.  No kidding, I could not taste the fish buried therein & the accompanying fries were limpy & not hot.  The Grand Cafe recently changed their menu & we were disappointed to find these items no longer included:   fish tacos, kale salad (wonderful & full of the best veggies), & the Teriyaki Bowl.  They did have a very good Asian chicken salad but now it has all cabbage instead of any lettuce (duh).  Why does a huge operation such as this continue to be low-grade?  Red Rock is a fine casino that normally caters well to its patrons.  And how can the main chef at the buffet be so adept & pay attention to our needs, when the powers-that-be in the Grand Cafe keep missing the mark?",

They are from 1975 with bland flavoring and an emphasis on low cost ingredients. The Thai peanut chicken salad in particular comes with tiny shreds of dry chicken buried in a massive mound of white cabbage.   The service continues to be lackluster and inattentive -- the food did not come as ordered and came missing relatively important elements like the salad dressing. Nothing major but takes time and effort on our part to get fixed.   It's a shame because we do like the Red Rock Hotel and now have to travel off site for casual meals.",

I ask \"what extra service is there when you put the same food in a styrofoam container as opposed to on a plate?\" He has no response and I ask to speak with a manager. She's rather snippy and says along the lines, \"corporate makes us do this\" and \"There's nothing I can do about it. The cooks have to put together the to go orders and it costs $4 extra.\"  Now, I'm not the type to pinch pennies, but I couldn't justify paying this silly \"service\" charge. So, I took the container for the order out of the bag and handed it to her and said, \"never mind, just take it off the bill.\"   Extra poor judgement by both management and corporate.

I do recall a friend of mine having the country fried steak and being a bonified CFS connoisseur, claims it was pretty darn good.  I believe another friend of mine ordered done whip cream with a side of coffee, lol.  Other than that, it's aight.  The rating on Yelp isn't that great and may make diners reluctant to order.  Still, I hope that restaurants take criticism to heart and learn from reviewers.    It was a pleasant surprise to learn that the patty melt received some good reviews and decided to put it to the test.  Everyone else seemed to get the normal casino dishes, steak, prime rib, etc.  The bad thing was that all the prime ribs that came out were way overcooked.  The good thing is that our server managed to replace them free of charge and done to preference the next go around (medium rare and slightly bloody).   I know that Station Casino's mail out a monthly discount booklet, one of which included this place for a $10.00 discount.  Unsure of the specifics, but not a bad deal at all.  Unfortunately, we failed to bring it, again and dealt with the damage accordingly.  Otherwise, the place is convenient and quick and nestled into a corner of the Red Rock casino floor, which can be confusing to navigate at times.  The deserts to me are more of a highlight here if you are looking to satisfy your sweet tooth.  Enjoy.",

    "text": "Last time I was here our waitress took our order right away . She quickly left and never saw her again. We were sitting there for 20 minutes no water just napkins in lap. Finally I wave down a busser just because I was so thirsty, right before he brings our drinks the food hits the table. Haven't even had a sip of water yet. So after about a half hour our waitress shows back up and asks if we needed anything . I ask for some condiments and she then just disappears ! I wave down the busser again to assist me. After I complained to the manager and he didn't discount anything off my meal, also said he would take off the forgotten bacon on my burger but never did. I then proceed to pay and ask for my players card back. They can't find it and guess where it was ? In the damn trash can after I watched the waitress pull it out and hand it to me. Terrible service, only come here for the late night special.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came here for dinner after seeing that the line for the buffet was three miles long. We wanted burgers anyway, but LBS was packed and this place was relatively empty... seemed like a good choice.  We got the buffalo chicken wings as an appetizer and they were amazing, so everything was looking good. Then we got the burgers.   I got the bleu cheese bacon burger, and my bf got the classic. To quote him; \"Wow, this is f*cking delicious.\" The burgers are VERY messy and gooey, so if you don't want your plate to look like a sea of condiments when you're done eating, then maybe this isn't the place for you. But I personally prefer that, and we left extremely happy.  Minus a star because the service was kind of slow and it took forever for us to get our appetizer. But the food was delicious. We'll be back.   (Bonus points: they're open 24 hours... good if you are starving after a late movie, like I often am!)",

The eggs were so perfectly poached that it pained me to break them, but the hollandaise was kind of bland. I can't remember what hollandaise tastes like, but I can't imagine that butter + egg yolks would equal bland. My mom had corned beef hash which looked (and tasted) very similar to the canned kind.   The breakfast here was just okay. I don't know why there is always a big line because it's not even cheap. Next time I will just grab a starbucks and hit the blackjack tables.",

    "text": "Having lived in Summerlin there's not a lot of dining options, mostly chain restaurants. The Grand Cafe is one of the few places that is open late and close by. The food here is really overpriced but maybe that's because if you're a degenerate gambler you think you're getting a great deal. One time my Dad and I came in for an advertised special on their website and the staff there said that the special was was too popular so they stopped offering it until after the new year. This didn't make any sense at all. Isn't the point of having specials to get people into the door to gamble? My dad complained to Station Casinos and they said they would \"Do an investigation\" and get back to him. They never got back to him, never even offered him a voucher for free food, nothing. Maybe my father doesn't gamble enough for them to care.  Another time we went for the breakfast special and my father got food poisioning from the food, so he swore it off after that. My food was cold not to mention the awful quality of food there. There's hardly anybody in there when we've been there to eat, so that should tell ou something. It's just another one of those joints to churn out slop for the gamblers. If Station Casinos really cared about locals and not about locals money they would actually put some effort into having decent food.",

    "text": "Horrible food! Horrible service!  Manager, Donovan  When we arrived there were about 3 parties in line. The hostess came over and asked us how many in our party. She didn't mention it would be a 40 minute wait. When  I asked how much longer they said another 10 minutes, they were busy with a party.   I asked what could be done for the inconvenience of an hour wait at a coffee shop that has never before had a wait and she got her manager. Donovan was less than helpful and didn't even apologize for the wait. Basically he said too bad.   We sat unacknowledged at the table for 8 minutes before we were offered a beverage. The quality of the food has severely declined since our last visit. The sandwich was dry. The bread was hard and the french fries inedible. When the waitress eventually returned to ask how the food was, I told her \"not as good as past visits\" she said \"I know. I guess it's because we are busy\". So she knew the food was bad and still served it!  Prices are high. 11.00 for a sandwich, 3.00 for a soda. Not worth it!  In customer service myself for over 20 years I found this unacceptable. I would not recommend this establishment to anyone. They were obviously not equipped to handle a lunchtime rush.",

    "text": "Well we came for the grave yard special and let's just say this, I believe they discount it due to the lack of service, we were seated and about 15 mins later the waiter comes and takes our orders then walks away 10 mins later he returns with water then he disappears roughly for the next 45 mins, are water has been long gone since and our food finally appears, well I ordered my steak medium, so imagine as I cut into my steak and it's a dark gray inside, the steak was rubbery and dry giving it a sense that it has been sitting under a heating lamp for quite a while. He sees our waters empty and says he will be back to refill them then disappears another 5 mins before finally returning. At which time I mentioned the steak he said he can get me another one but I said at this rate you'll be serving breakfast by then. Over all the food and the value is great but every time I come to the graveyard specials here the service takes well over an hour even when there's little to few guest in the cafe. I will say the manager did offer to take it off the bill which is great but I did eat it so I feel I should pay for what I ate the issue here was the rate of speed and not the food the steak was hard and rubbery but still edible. If you're looking for midnight specials I suggest driving a short 5 mins away to Rampart Casino, they have some really amazing specials for $2.21 plus a graveyard menu as well service there is prompt friendly and very welcoming.",

They had a lot to choose from, but I was unsure since I didn't pick out from previous reviews what is the go to on the menu.  I somehow passed Prime Rib, and had immediately made my decision to order it.    Prime Rib, for the price, was not bad.  Its a rather large piece as a matter of fact.  I couldn't even eat it all.  BUT, its probably because I had about 1 and 1/2 pieces.  I'll tell you that because when the first Prime Rib was delivered, it was cold.  I was so hungry and didn't want to flag down the waiter, I figured, let me just bite into it and deal with it.  Nope, I couldn't.  It wasn't cold as in frozen, just I think it took a while to get to my table.  So, I did eventually flag down the waiter, asked them to warm it, but my waiter kindly gave me a new serving.  It was hot, it was more on the medium I ordered it at, and I was satisfied.  It was served with sides, I got fries and veggies.  The veggies are frozen type, so we all know how frozen veggies taste like, bland.    Not the best food experience, but the staff here was genuinely pleasing.  Okay for late night eating when you got the munchies.  Again, it is a Cafe.",

Said would much rather have slower service than have to wait in line. Said that's now how they do business. Basically indicated that that's our tough luck. We left unserved as did others in line had. We went next door to the Asian Noodle place and were immediately seated, ordered, only to then see the same manager and have him walk by us. He just smerked at us as if to say \"Gotcha\".

    "text": "This place seems to serve buffet leftovers with a restaurant price. I had meatloaf which actually was frozen and then fried on a pan. It should be called dry beef patty burned on both sides. Veggies from cans that came with it were a bad joke at best. Kids spaghetti and meatball (there's only one ball) was decent the ball being watery.  With 7-8 employees and no customers overall experience was OK but not worth money or time. You're better off with the buffet. Or actual restaurants nearby the casino. Do Denny's or IHOP if you want better but not buffet or restaurant.",

My other favorite is their California Cobb salad.  My wife had their Chicken Supreme sandwich and that's always good for her.    The Cafe is pricey compared to some of their other in casino cafes.  Service can be tough, but we usually ask for Jose or Yuan.  They are both top notch and treat us well.",

My bf got some comps here thanks to his playing craps we ended up going here around 8am there was no line so we decided to try it out. I ordered the Belgium waffle with a side of sausage patties, the waffle was delicious very moist and I loved that they served it with HOT syrup and enough of it to cover my whole waffle. The sausage was so gross I couldn't take more then the first bite first off it was beef not pork which I hate beef sausage and it tasted like rubber. I washed my food down with a mimosa which was pretty delicious. My bf got fried eggs pancakes and sausage links which he loved and demolished in 10 seconds. The service was also good as well I would definitely return here again I'm pretty shocked it only has 2 and a half stars I guess I went at the right time and ordered the right thing.",

We were enjoying the atmosphere when we finally decided we better go in and get a waitress as no one was servicing the tables. After three requests, a waitress showed up to take our order. After an hour of placing our order we were all but forgotten again. After going in and asking for our order three times we finally got our order. Every dish was dried up, and fresh tomatoes wilted from sitting under a heat lamp. The surface of the food was warm. Beyond that it was cold.   It's absolutely incredible how poorly this segment of Red Rock Hotel is supervised.  If you want to just sit there with no service of any kind, go there....  Bring your food and a beverage with you, and you would be just fine.",

Why have such a beautiful room if you are just going to mail it in when it comes to service??   We were at the Red Rock Lanes and bowling with friends when we all decided to grab a quick bite afterwards. Sunday night and the room isn't even a quarter occupied. Should be alright, right?  Nope.  (+) Room is beautiful and easily the best of the Grand Cafes.  (-) Started off waiting nearly 10 minutes just to be seated even though it was very slow. (-) Orders were taken in a timely fashion, but then it took literally 45 minutes to get our food! We watched a group of 4 get seated, order, AND receive their food before we received ours. Not f*cking cool at all.  (-) during the 45 minute wait, no drinks were refilled and no one said a word to us to let us know why things were taking so long. Nice.  Once the food finally arrived, it was alright. Nothing to write home to Mom about, but it got the job done. Honestly, it was about what I was expecting. The food wasn't the problem, it was the shitty, lackluster service. I'm actually a little peeved right now because my friend erred in his math and over tipped these clowns. They sure as hell did NOT deserve the tip he gave them!  During this entire experience all I kept thinking about was the same experience I've had at other Grand Cafes, namely the one at GVR. Okay food, sh*t service.   Not only am I one and done with this spot, I am quite done with ALL Grand Cafes.  1 star.",

Since they're staying at the Red Rock Resort, the Grand Cafe was the easiest choice. Thanks to the player's card discount benefits, our small group was able to have a quick and reasonably inexpensive breakfast consisting of plated pancakes, sausage/bacon and eggs (your choice of prep), toast and coffee all at a sub-six dollar price point per person. Burgers and Eggs Benedict are also available for a few dollars more, but it seemed everyone was jonesing for a classic American breakfast and skipped those options. Our server was attentive as well despite the morning rush crowd and even quickly remedied a few of our complaints such as getting the bacon redone and rye toast switched out for sourdough. The \"specials\" menu wasn't overwhelmingly impressive or extensive compared to other cafes found at the strip but the relaxed atmosphere plus the food to price ratio made up for it. Sometimes simpler is just better.",

We played video poker as we always do, then proceeded over to Grand cafe and asked to sit outside. The hostess said she had to ask if the patio was open. She went over to the managers. Apparently, there were two. One bigger male and one smaller dark haired male with glasses. The later came over and said the patio is closed. I told my husband I am hungry, so I went to the bar at the Cafe  to order food. My husband went to the center bar and waited for me. I ordered my dinner through Fabio at the bar. Fabio was great. He took my order and delivered it in a very timely manner. I didn't want to keep my husband waiting, so I boxed up the rest. And, before I left asked Fabio when the patio is open. He replied 24/7. Then I  proceeded to tell him about my experience at the hostess stand. He said he would have served us out on the patio. He was puzzled why management told us it was closed (no high winds, no excessive heat) Maybe, they were short servers. I don't know, but both my husband and I felt unwelcome by the management. Luckily, Fabio saved the day with his great attitude and excellent service. Bottom line, bypass the management and ask for Fabio at the bar. He'll take fabulous care of you.",

    "text": "Located inside the Red Rock Resort and Casino, Grand Cafe is your typical run-of-the-mill 24-hour diner with a menu that has something for everyone.  It was about 10:00 in the morning when we dined here... there was no wait, so we were seated promptly. And that was the only thing that was ever prompt. The rest of the dining experience was... fair but slow as molasses. Our server was polite, very chatty, but everything just took so long. From the taking the order of the drinks to receiving the drinks, to the food order to getting the food - everything took seemingly FOREVER.  The food itself was fine.  We ordered a Denver omelet, kid's pancakes and bacon, and a BLTA w/ fries.  The BLT came with generous amounts of bacon and the fries were good and crispy. The breakfast entrees were pretty basic and standard.   In short - meals were fine but don't come here if you're in any kind of a hurry!",

It was an early Sunday morning and unfortunately The Feast was not open today but luckily Grand Cafe was. This cafe is actually open 24 hours and I am so glad we found it because wow was this place pretty good.  Grand Cafe is a good name because they do go grand for breakfast!   For my entree I got The Elivs waffle is a  Belgium  waffle topped with bananas, bacon, peanut butter and Nutella cream! This has got to be one of the best waffles I've ever had. Not only was it beautifully presented but it was delicious. It was savory due to the bits of bacon and sweet due to the bananas, peanut butter and Nutella. It was unique and so good.  The rest of the folks in my party got the Energy omelet. It's supposed to come with chicken,  egg whites, spinach, onions, mushroom and Hollandaise sauce.Unfortunately all three of the Energy omelets at our table lacked chicken. The chef forgot but the manager was nice enough to give a $2 discount per each plate lacking the chicken! I thought that was nice.  All of the breakfast specials come with either a bloody mary or a mimosa but for non-alcoholic drinkers, you can substitute coffee. This is what I did and I thought it was a great deal to have a $10 big entree with coffee.  I liked this place a lot and also was impressed with the various baked goods they had in the front. From giant cookies to pumpkin bars, I was so tempted to get one. Alas that will have to be saved for another day.",

But overall the service was extremely slow even though it wasn't crowded, and the food was terrible!!!!!!!  11:00 am seated our party of (6) consisting of (3) adults and (3) children  We quickly got our drink orders placed and fulfilled. It's a little confusing because your waitress doesn't take your drink orders, a separate person does this. So we never really got introduced to our waitress. She just came and took our orders.  11:07am placed our food orders  11:36am our food arrived.  The food had been sitting. Our fries were no longer warm, my soup was lukewarm and not hot.   The kids grilled cheese was BARELY grilled... looked like 2 breads microwaved with cheese in the middle. Cheese wasn't melted.  Again, fries were cold.  The adult menu grilled cheese was better, but very oily.... and I'm MOST upset about the \"tomato soup\" that it came with, which was NOT a soup.. more like tomato flavored baby food.. even the texture was disgusting like straight up baby food from a can!!!! It was not a soup. It was a puree of some sort and didn't taste very well either.   Everything just seemed undercooked, rushed, and cold.... yet took half an hour to come out of the kitchen?  Our waters were never ever refilled... we needed to call someone over to refill our water.  Service was overall terrible, EXTREMELY SLOW, and the waitress kept making excuses for everyone in the resultant.. \"oh sorry, the chef didn't know...\" like cmon get your sh*t together.  In the end, they didn't even charge us for our drinks and she tried to add it on afterwards but then changed her mind because I guess the kids drinks came with their meal included.   I wouldn't recommend this place nor would I come back.",

This place is 24 hours so if you have a late night craving this place can satisfy your needs and you can go right outside to table after.  I own a stations casino card and I come here for their deals such as the skillet for $5.99. The skillet contains bacon, sausage links, three eggs, biscuit covered in gravy and a sizable amount of hash browns. The only way to get the deals for this menu is if you order the entree with a drink.  If you order stuff off the regular menu, just be mindful it can get pretty pricy. Had ordered special waffles with fruits etc and came up to 20+ with a glass of lemonade. The waitresses are very nice and frequently stop by to refill drinks or ask if any other services were needed or just to check up on you.",

    "text": "Let me just start off by saying that giving this place one star is being overly generous.  We went to Red Rock on Sat. 5/21 and had originally planned to go to the buffet.  However the line was super long so we decided to try the Grand Cafe instead.  We were seated and brought our drinks fairly quickly. I ordered a house salad and the NY strip steak which the menu said came with baked potato, mushrooms and veggies.  Salad had a hair in it, I got mashed potatoes instead of baked and no mushrooms.  The steak was bland as hell and didn't even seem like they had the decency to season it with salt & pepper.  My mother ordered a belgium waffle... they brought her pancakes.  My step-father ordered pancakes with toast... never brought out the toast.  It took a full 20-minutes to bring out the waffle and toast and at least 10-minutes for my salad!  We called over the manager whose name I don't recall.  He came tromping over with his little clipboard, a smug look on his face and at first said he would only comp the salad for having a hair in it.  My parents would not stand for that so he said, \"I'm only authorized to offer 25% off the bill.\"  For service like this we all thought that was insufficient.  When asked who is able to authorize more than 25% he very rudely said he's the only one and that this was not up for negotiation.  I told him there was no need to be rude about it and in his snooty, condecending tone said, \"Thank you, I appreciate that.\" and stormed off.  My parents reluctantly paid the remainder of the bill with their comped players card points and swore they/we would never go there again.  On the plus side, the young lady that refilled our drinks and kept our table clean was very prompt, attentive and polite... so she got the tip!",

The waiter Doug took all of our orders. A hamburger meal a steak meal and mine. My friends got their food 10minutes before I did bland someone that ordered the same food as I later then me got their food first. I paid no mind to it because he said my food was coming. I finally got my food. After I was done eating I asked for the bill for me. Doug gave me the bill and it was wrong. It stated 6.99 I informed Doug that it was wrong. Doug took my card and charged 3 bacon skilits which was 16.18 cents. I was slowly getting frustrated because I have had to correct Doug at least 5 times tonight and I was being nothing but curtious to Doug. Instead of going to Doug at this time I went and spoke to Dina who did not know what dough was doing and even went to ask and Doug kind of blew her off. She then called the manager and uncharted my card and 're charged it for the right amount. I will not be going back to this place because of Doug and how he treats certain people. The last and final straw was after everything was corrected when I got back to my table Doug used some foul language as he passed me which made me want to jump down his throat for all that he had don that early morning. I will suggest never to go here in the early morning because services are horrible. Especially if you have Doug as your waiter. I will take my business somewhere else and I hope you will do the same.",

I understand that its located at Red Rock Casino, and of course a lot of people will probably think, \"It got to be good, since its at Red Rock Casino.\" So lot of people will probably have high expectations of the place, and I bet you, not many of them will have their expectations met.   As for me, I did have some mix feelings about the place. It is a fancy looking cafe, located in one of the popular station casinos. So thinking, that it's in a fancier casino, pricing is probably a bit more then expected. But knowing that it is a 24 hour joint, the first thing I think of is, Denny's. Which brings the thought of food, that's fairly done, but not quite done the way you want it, or it's done, where you can't even stand touching it.  But you'll probably eat it, cause its edible, or that, you're really hungry, you'll eat anything.  I had the Philly cheese steak, with fries. I loved how the sandwich was made and the bread was just right. But the french fries on the other hand, were kind of dry and crunchy. But again, I really don't expect much at a 24 hour cafe. There are some out there that does better, others are just average. Grand Cafe, is one of those average ones,  in a high end station casino.    I would recommend this, if you're only looking for a place to sit and eat. But, remember that you're at one of the high end station casinos, which may make it pricey, depending what you pick. Don't set your expectations to high, cause it is a 24 hour cafe, and the food is probably average for any kind of 24 hour diner out there.",

We have tried to give them many chances and it never changes. Today I ordered a pot of their fresh brewed black tea.  The bus boy brings me out a cup of hot water and a tea bag. When I asked if they changed their tea -  he's short with me and tells me that they are out of pots??  The place is almost empty. No apology and just walks away.   Then the food comes out. Round one.  My sausages are luke warm at best.  I send them back. Round two.  My sausages are RAW. No apology from the waiter. He just looks to make sure I'm not lying. A few minutes later, he comes back,  without a word, grabs the check off the table and brings it back  (He took my meal off but never said a word).   I've stayed away for a long time ftom here for experiences like this.  I'm not sure I will give them anymore.",

    "text": "This was my first time at the Grand Cafe at the Red Rock Casino. It was lunchtime on a Saturday and there was a bit of a line. A hostess was walking the line asking how many were in each party. But the line was so long as was her list of numbers, I don't know how she gathered any useful information and, of course, we were asked how many when we reached the front of the line anyway. We weren't given a choice of \"booth or table\" and we ended up at a small table near the door to the kitchen. That turned out to be a stroke of luck....because when our drinks arrived--a soda and a coffee--I was not given a straw and hubby had no spoon to stir his coffee. We couldn't flag down a server, so my husband simply walked to the kitchen door and hollered in for the needed utensils! After quite a wait for our food, my Corned Beef and Swiss Cheese sandwich finally came.....without the Swiss Cheese. But it was easier this time to wave down our server--he was at a nearby table apologizing to them for some negligence! Once the missing cheese was replaced, I will say that the sandwch was quite tasty and the side of mushroom soup was very, very good. I left feeling satisfied with the food, but the customer service definitely knocked off a few stars!",

    "text": "I wish I could give it 1, I really do.  If not for the $5.99 steak and eggs that were cooked properly, it would have been a 1.  Came to Red Rock for the Ladies all you can drink and to catch a late movie.  We were hungry afterwards and it just happened to be midnight so we naturally sidled up to Grand Cafe for some steak and eggers and stacks o' pancakes.  Medium rare steak and over easy eggs for me.  2 stacks of pancakes for my wife and her sister.  Medium steak and scrambled for my buddy.  2 cups of coffee.  Water all around.  We all had a good time eating, this was our second dinner after Boiling Crab.  Asked for the check around 1255.  Had our table cleared off around 0100 am.  0105 still no sigh of the check.  I overhear our server(at the POS station right next to my chair) muttering about how she can't find our check.  10 minutes later she tells us she can't find our check, and asks if we paid already.  I stupidly said no.  She continues half \"looking\" and half fulfilling drink orders and serving them and taking food orders.  Seriously?  Please find my f*cking check.  Every time I look at her, she's either telling the guy who cleared our table that she can't find our bill, or she's muttering to herself that she can't find it.  I don't understand why this is so mind-boggling.  You can do either of two things at this point.  You could A) ask us what we got or B) Check the tape, because someones always watching in the casino.  If you truly lost it, would it hurt to generate another one, if you know the first won't ever be accidentally paid?  Are you afraid of making too much money?  You're not going to get screwed out of something, but you will get screwed out of your tip if you dick around.  We get up from the table and go to the cashier where the man she answers to, coincidentally, the man who happened to clear our table and ask how everything was, was standing.  She hands him our check.  Like, what kind of abracadabra BS is that?  It just magically appeared in her hand and she gives it to him.  It sucks that she's apologetic and says thanks for being patient. Except I'm not patient.  We ask if we can pay out.  Mr. Man says, \"It'll just be a second I (in italics) JUST got this\".  \"We're just saying, we've been asking for the check for 30 minutes now.\"  His response?  The exact same thing he said earlier.  \"Blah blah, I JUST got this.\"  Don't be a dick, dick.  You know how long we've been waiting to pay.  You're the dude that cleared our table.  And it doesn't hurt to say sorry, it also doesn't pay to be a jerk to your customers.  And it's not like this place is wall to wall patrons.  It's after midnight and it's maybe a quarter to a third full.  So to our server, sorry you got stiffed on the tip, but you can blame that dude you handed our bill too.  I hate to do that.  I know that people rely on their tips, but it's not against the law to not tip, and for me, tips are based not only on service, but also on grace, attitude and the humility to accept when you've screwed something up.    I hate that my steak was good, and the pancakes were delicious, and the coffee was strong hot and fresh.",

    "text": "Every so often because of my degenerative ways, Red Rock sends me coupons for free food and beverage at their resort.  Usually I utilize them at the buffet or LBS, but something inspired me to try the Grand Cafe on my latest sortie over there.  Maybe it was the high ceilings, or the pastries displayed in the glass cases that you can see from the casino at the front of the restaurant, but the place looked really appetizing.  I held out hope that a casino cafe could truly be inspiring, alas however it was not to be.  I found a standard offering that  serves its purpose and nothing more.  I should have realized this earlier, I mean I keep watching Saturday Night Live thinking its going to be funny again, but it never is.  Now don't get me wrong, the food is fine enough and never really disappointed.  I opted for their \"3 course\" menu and got the turkey with mashed potatoes, vegetables and gravy. It reminded me of something I would get at a cafe in middle America which had some nostalgic value but its not going to get confused for thanksgiving day.  For my appetizer, I opted for the shrimp cocktail and for desert I got the brownie sundae.  Neither were big or particularly amazing, but they were edible and satiated.   Overall, I think my total bill with a drink came to 14 bucks which my coupon mostly covered,  Would I come here again?  Perhaps if I was at the casino but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there.  The breakfasts looked standard and I think thats where they do the bulk of their business.  Service was friendly and efficient although it should be noted I was eating at around 10pm on a Wednesday (remember how I said I was a degenerate?)  In any event, an unremarkable meal which I guess for a casino cafe is kind of what you should be shooting for.  Although Im going to keep searching for that one that will surprise me...and waiting for Mike Myers to rejoin the cast of SNL too!  High ceilings and pastries in glass cases will get me every time...",

    "text": "I gotta hand it to Robert. He saved this place from a 1-star rating. I left him a big tip because of his great personality and customer service.  2 years ago I first came here. I waited about 10 minutes to get a seat even though I was first in line. After they sat me, I waited about 15 minutes for a server to come around. I tried to get the attention of the angry old blonde woman who works behind the cash register and she practically told me to eat a d*ck and get lost. When the server finally showed up, he was one of those  white dudes who speaks in Ebonics. I couldn't understand a word he was trying to tell me.  My food came out around 30 minutes later, and the server never came around to refill my drink.   Last night I came here for the graveyard special. I expected the same bad service and I was correct in my expectations. It took about 5 minutes for the host to come over and attempt to seat me. The host first took us to a table that still had a half eaten pancake on it. She then tried to seat us at another table that had a person still sitting in it. She then tried to seat us at another table that still had 4 plates, dirty napkins, and bottles of beer on it. Obviously there was something wrong with the host and busers here. She then sat us at a table which was far off in a corner.  Once again like in years past, we waited about 15 minutes for service. As we were waiting for service we could see all the other servers goofing off, laughing, and horse-playing. Two servers were playing tag and slapping each other in the legs while we were just sitting there waiting for someone to at least ask us what we wanted to drink. Something about seeing the workers playing like children and laughing out loud in enjoyment while the customers are miserable and waiting for service is just FUBAR...  I went to that same angry blond old lady at the cashier and she once again gave us a dirty look and practically told us to eat a d*ck and get lost. She hasn't changed at all in the last 2 years.   Finally, after another 5 minutes there was a series of angry attacks from other guests. One guest starting screaming profanity loudly and began hassling the manager.  A man and woman at a different table got so angry that they threw their menu and utensils on the floor and stormed out while giving the servers the royal finger.  I on the other hand was not that angry because I have lived in Las Vegas for a long time and ALWAYS expect bad service. Bad service is just a normal aspect of Las Vegas life. If I don't get bad service, that's when I am usually most surprised. I just endure the bad service and never leave a  tip. But, things began to turn around. The manager finally noticed that the whole restaurant was about to riot and ran into the kitchen and found a worker who did a great job solving the situation. We got a server named Robert who provided us excellent customer service and also got the manager to comp our meal. He even got our food out extremely fast. I really appreciate his hard work.   Will I be back? I sure will. I love graveyard specials and am willing to endure the bad service. It actually saves us all money when we get bad service because we don't tip. But, I'm more than happy to tip Robert a 20 if I get him as a server again.",

When it comes out the smell was so bad the person sitting 3 down from me could smell the rancid stinch.  When I say something I got a crazy look from the waitress.  She has another waiter smell it and he looked crazy. I'm sorry the waitress and the cook should both be fired. There is no way in hell they did not smell that steak was bad. I have been around rotten dead animals and it smelled worse than that. Then I ordered something different and it took 15 mins to come out.  No manager ever came over. This is the 2nd and final bad experience there. I will never set foot in that restaurant again.",

    "text": "Duplicate Review until Yelp Consolidates the two: Sticky Bun Apple Fritter Chocolate Chip Buttermilk Pancakes Tableside Flambee Bananas Foster French Toast Kitchen Sink Cookie Oatmeal Raisin Cookie Carrot Cake Bar  Located within walking distance of my door, and visited frequently for movies as well as meals at Hearthstone, I'd admittedly not given much thought to Red Rocks Resort and Casino's other dining options until I found out an old colleague was in town for a Bariatric Surgery conference and with her packed lecture schedule largely precluding lunch or dinner the decision was made to meet up at Grand Cafe for breakfast, the resulting meal anything but 'physician approved' but surprisingly delicious with service that outperformed nearly any of Las Vegas Boulevard's 24/7 dining options by a country mile.  Arriving just after 7:00am, but requiring a reprint of my Boarding Pass in order to collect on a $15 coupon, it was a few minutes later than anticipated that the two of us sat down in the large dining area overlooking an expectedly empty pool and deferring the order to me with the stipulation that we must try the pancakes a three-course meal was requested, a smiling Hispanic waitress effortlessly managing a half-dozen tables while keeping water brimming and the silver coffee pot of surprisingly balanced brew filled throughout the hour long stay.  Starting off with two pastries, the chopped pecan topped sticky bun and house-made apple fritter both rewarmed at our request, it was much to my astonishment that Red Rocks' in-house pastry team makes items throughout the day in order to replenish supplies and although the fritter was a touch too oily despite being jammed-packed with apples the nicely laminated bun unraveled as a textbook spiral, the exterior golden and crunchy while the interior featured a springy yeasted stretch packed with butter and cinnamon notes.  Moving onward to entrees, the four-stack of chocolate chip studded buttermilk flapjacks taking no shortcuts and fluffy as can be despite the bargain basement price of $8.78, there was no way I was passing of the \"house specialty\" Bananas Foster French Toast and with an unexpected tableside show of liquor-laced caramel being lit ablaze as it was poured over thick egg-bread with whipped cream added afterward every single bite of the dish was well worth not only the $8.95 tab, but also the signature status - easily one of the best off-Strip French Toasts in town and the only one I know of that is delivered with such flair.  Sitting, chatting, and sipping at third pot of coffee with my friend stating she couldn't possibly eat another bite it was only here that I realized I'd not yet spent the requisite $30 to qualify for use of the coupon and leaving aside just how much of a bargain that indicates for the rest of what we ordered it also justified the purchase of a trio of desserts, the elegant carrot cake beneath crispy praline bark proving quite moist even before considering the rich cream cheese frosting while both of the cookies were admittedly quite sweet, though soft centered with a crispy rim that held up nicely for an afternoon snack later that day.  Using the coupon with a total bill after tax and tip ringing in at a mere $26 one would be hard pressed to name a better bargain for such a large amount of surprisingly well made food in any Southern Nevada casino and with service proving better than several places charging more than twice the price for food no better I've little doubt I'll revisit Grand Cafe sooner rather than later, at the very least to sample some more of the extensive pastry case...though I can't rule out another order of fiery French Toast, as well.",

If you do not drink coffee for breakfast, that may be OK with you. The coffee served looked as light as tea and tasted like water. It took us five minutes just to flag someone down to let them know about it. The excuse that we got was that the machine makes the coffee and decides on its concentration??? A smaller coffee carafe was brought to us and it was a little more decent yet still watered down. The waiter actually said that we should order espressos which would cost a little more but would be better coffee. We ended up going to Starbucks after for real coffee. The food is OK. I had the red rock spa breakfast platter which came with egg whites scrambled, apple sausage, and wheat toast. What was extremely disappointing was that I also ordered a fruit platter. I was not aware that a fruit salad tossed in a very small bowl that is easily at least one day old is considered a fruit platter. What is worse, it cost $10 and was likely only worth three dollars. This is not a restaurant I would recommend for breakfast to anyone as it just wasn't very good in terms of the competition out there for breakfast and the service was average to less than average. The restaurant looks nice, but the actual substance of it is poor. This is not a restaurant that I plan on returning to.",

My family and I accidentally got in line thinking it was the Vietnamese restaurant next door. Seating was fairly fast granted it was during mother's day weekend. Our server was very friendly however we ordered 3 salmons and 2 steaks and they forgot about our order. After waiting about an hour and a half we got a fruit plate from the manager apologizing for the inconvenience but sadly still never received our meal due to computer error. I don't think I will ever eat here again.",

    "text": "Looks nice when you walk in.  This time I was seated immediately after the last \"fake\" wait.   It was dinnertime but I ordered the crab and avocado omelet.  Hash browns were nasty.  Omelet was overcooked and kind of dry.  There was supposed to be a sauce with it and there was a couple tablespoons of something like white gravy in the middle of the plate but not enough to fix the dry.  The waiter was fast, efficient and friendly so points there.  Honestly, the best thing about the experience was the hot tea!  I drink a lot of tea so I was thrilled the had chamomile because caffeine and I don't get alone and when a bigger than average metal pot was brought I noticed it was heavy on the bottom.  One of my big pet peeves is tea gets cold fast.  This didn't happen.  That pot might have been heated on the bottom and then had boiling water poured over the loose leaf tea (no tacky low-grade bags).  Plus, it wasn't a funky mug but a fairly decent cup albeit not as thin and delicate as traditional tea cups... but this made me happy. Honestly, I would go there for a cup of tea!  Aside from the fact that it's convenient and I enjoyed the tea experience, I've had better food at IHOP for half the price.",

    "text": "TLDR: late-night specials on week nights, friendly service, bakery items to-go, moderately priced entrees otherwise  Grand Cafe is the only way the casino can function due to its 24-hour status. We frequent this location after 11 o'clock bingo or a late-night movie or boba run since it's close to home. Having been to other grand cafes, I'm happy to write this review to share my experience, food quality, and service provided.   All of the servers work their butt off, including the manager who always wears a coat. My last experience was on a Thursday night/Friday morning at 1230am. It was the only time I'm ever waited in a line to be seated. The hostess/cashier/bakery attendant informed me that Thursday nights have been busier than the weekends and it's the day that's staffed the least. But since, it's the last day where you can get the late-night specials, it makes sense.   My order varies based on my appetite, but I love breakfast so I can't resist anything with eggs. I usually order the All-nighter skillet: 2 eggs, hash browns, and toast for $1.99. What a steal? If I'm being an extra fatty, I pair it with a short stack: 2 large pancakes about 8 inches in diameter with a buttery residue...it's also $1.99. Sometimes I order the 1/2 pound classic burger with mayo, lettuce and tomato (no onions please) and it comes with fries...all for $2.99. My friend ordered the chicken fried steak for $5.99: 2 eggs, hash browns, 2 pieces of toast, and a large piece of chicken fried steak (about the size of 2 palms). It's actually pretty filling and doesn't taste half-bad.   I'm really big on water and there filtered water tastes awesome. Refills are 80% consistent, but I drink so much that my expectations are low for refills, especially when my server is tasked with 9 tables. I'm pretty patient at this location and the free wifi helps. The one time I've had a problem, I brought it to the attention of the manager and my meal was free. Ever since then, I've always come and been served with respect.",

I got a steak & shrimp for 9.99, the kids got hamburger and French fries for 3.99, and my babe got prime rib for like 14.99. We had been driving for a while, it was late, and we were hungry. No complaints about the food, it's not a high end restaurant so we didn't expect much.   The reason for the high review is mainly for our awesome waitress. Apparently someone complained to her about me breastfeeding. For the record my baby was even in a carrier, grow up people. Well our waitress came over, made a point to tell me someone said something and if they say anything to me, to tell her and she will say something, she apologized for them, and later even brought my kids some desserts because she felt bad. Come to find out it was the lady next to us.  Her customer service alone was awesome, I really wish I just had her name. (White lady, shorter hair I think, maybe in her 40s). Thank you whoever you are!",

Another server whos job is only to bring drinks brings me a plate with lemon and honey and a small pot with my tea.  Before setting the tea pot down he bangs it on the table several times.  Not sure what that was about.  After waiting for over 25 minutes our food finally arrived.  My friend asked me to taste his steak because he thought it tasted funny.  I didn't even put the bite in my mouth the steak stunk! It was rotten!  The server even smelled it and cringed.  How could the cook not smell that while it was cooking.  The smell lingered in the area even after the plate was taken away.  I will never eat there again.  Although the server apologized no one from management apologized to us.  Not what I expect from Red Rock.",

We must have come here on a good day because the reviews on Yelp are pretty bad.   My bf ordered the $3.99 breakfast special - 2 eggs, bacon toast hash and he also ordered a smoothie. I ordered the California omelet which was delicious. It had mushrooms, sliced tomatoes and goat cheese. Mmmmmm! I didn't have any complaints. Food came out hot and pretty fast.   Food is slightly overpriced (Station really needs to drop the crappy \"We Love Locals\" garbage because.... They don't!!) they don't even let locals into the pool even if you want to pay!!

Usually, I would not even waste the time of day placing such a review, but if you're in the mood to ruin your appetite Robin is here to help!  I met my mother here, who made the biggest mistake of asking to make an order to-go. \"WE DONT DO THAT!\" is the answer we were provided by Robin. \"If you order food and I bring it to the table, you can put it in a to-go box yourself.\" These were the kind words that were given to my mom, who I might add just got off a shift working at the SAME property. As a red rock employee, you can expect my classy lady of a mother, to treat you with the best experience and utmost courtesy no matter how difficult you can be. Not with Robin, you can be smiling from ear to ear and she's sure to kill your vibe!   The experience ruined our appetites and we ended up leaving pretty salty about the situation. My advice, ask if Robin is working the grave shift, and then ask to be seated with a different server.",

    "text": "Went to the Grand Cafe at the Red Rock, before our movie.   I've been here several times. I love getting the Philly steak sandwich w/cheese, onions and I add mushrooms.  It has always been delicious, so I don't order anything new. Like always, I ordered it.  I took a picture and was excited to tasty it. Here's where things turned.    I took my first bite and was chewing.  I then realized that there was a long hair in my mouth, twisted around the meat.  I started to pull it out.  It seemed like forever, as I was holding back my gag reflex.   Soooo disgusting.  I immediately called over the waitress.     The waitress (Jerrilynn, which was awesome), apologized over and over.  She took it to the Manager, Don.   He came over to apologize.  He said, there's not much I can say'. WTF.  He ask what else he could have made for me.  I wasn't even sure I could eat, being so grossed out, I needed a few minutes to see if I could get over it.  He kept making suggestions, like the Prime Rib (most expensive item on the menu - I'll get to that comment later).  He kept standing there for an awkward amount of time, until the waitress saved me by saying, let's give her a few minutes.    The waitress came back a couple of times to see if I was ready, but no pressure.  After about 15 minutes, and my BF was done with his food, the waitress came back and I told her I would try something completely different.  I ordered the Bread Pudding French Toast.    The French toast was absolutely delicious.  I took half home, since my regular appetite hasn't returned and my BF had finished along time ago and we didn't want to be late for our movie.  Again the waitress was so apologetic and gave us our bill.     We finished and headed to the cashier.  I noticed that my Philly was removed from the bill, but the French toast remained.  I thought it would have been a nice gesture by the new Manager to take off that item, since my dining experience was ruined by their employee's hair that was half way down my throat, on my first bite!  I asked the cashiers to call for him.    Side note:   Every time I go there, seems like the same cashiers (Hispanic girls), are never friendly!!!    A lot of people need jobs, and they should be thankful to be working for an awesome hotel, therefore, being happy while they are working.      The manager arrived, I told him that it would have been nice for him to check out our bill 'before' we received it and was surprised to see the French Toast on there. So....  my thoughts on how he handled this.  Once he figured that he lost the revenue on the Philly, he wanted to still profit by getting me to pay for some other food,  don't forget about the most expensive item on the menu that he wanted me to get, the Prime Rib.  After I asked him, he didn't reply, but took the receipt from my hand and headed to a register.  He came back with not much to say.  I think he said 'I've taken care of it'. I wanted to say, Yeah, only after I had to bring it up to you (which was awkward and embarrassing for me).    Well, I love the Red Rock Hotel and Casino, and all they have to offer, but I can't say if I'll be back to the Grand Cafe.  If I do, it will be because of the waitress.",

If you drench it in enough butter and syrup, it tastes much better! lol I had the $7.99 steak and eggs. They were cooked perfectly, but they just tasted like char. With enough A1 and salt/pepper, you'll be just fine. The hash browns were not crispy.   The bloody mary on the other hand was very good!   I can't complain about the service because there was only one gal working 10 tables and she was actually very hardworking. They should staff more servers on these Saturday nights.",

Then a busboy came by just to say that the server will be by soon, about another 5 minutes passes and that same busboy comes back and asks what we would like to drink. Then another 7-10 minutes go by and he finally brings the drinks, except for my sons milkshake that took another 15 minutes to arrive at the table. Then finally the server arrived to take our order, we ordered a side of biscuits and gravy, country fried steak, grilled cheese, French toast, and an omelet. After we ordered, we waited another 25 minutes and still no food or drink refills. My wife went to speak with the manager and then the waitress showed up with the food, we believe the manager said something to the server. Then he server started to give attention to our table and did her job better. Now for the food review, Not good,  the biscuits and gravy was salty. I maybe ate a couple bites only. My sons grilled cheese was made with Texas toast, he just didn't like it, only ate 1/2 of it when this kids eats like a horse (teenager). My wife didn't like the chicken fried steak, just picked at it. The French toast was just ok at best. They did take the drinks off the bill to compensate for their horrible service. Later that day, we all had to spend extra time in the bathroom if you know what I mean. That's the last time we will go there, we are regulars at Red Rock and most of their food outlets are good but Grand Cafe will NEVER get our business again. I would give zero stars if yelp had that option.",

    "text": "I was visiting my mom in Vegas for the holidays and Red Rock is her go-to casino.  So we were there gambling and had dinner at the Grand Cafe.  They definitely can be hit or miss on the food and service but this time around everything was great.    I had the kitchen sink salad (I think that is what its called).  Its with shrimp and hearts of palm.  I always get balsamic vinaigrette with it instead of the dressing listed on the menu.  This is always one of my favorite salads.  Mom had the Philly cheesesteak with fries.  It was huge.  She liked the meat flavor and the grilled peppers and onions.  She took half of it home for another meal.    Service was consistent. Drink refills were regular.  Overall a good meal.",

The hash browns weren't as crispy as I'd expect, but nothing to complain about. I would come eat here again.",

Beer came right up and I quickly ordered the nacho appetizer, no beans no olives.  15 minutes later a plate of nachos with mounds of olives comes out. \"Sorry but I asked for no olives\" no problem let me take it back.  Another 15 minutes and a correct but dissapointing looking plate comes out. I ordered the nachos because the guy next to me had them and they looked grejustat.  Now after 30 minutes I was hoping these would be awesome, unfortunately they just werent. Shredded chicken with no seasoning.  And the cheese was just nacho cheese sauce so can't even blame the time on melting cheese.  I'll stick to yard house",

I don't think being able to make stiff peaks in your soup  is a positive.  The grilled cheese seemed promising but was gelatinous mess.  They attempted to make a cheese tuile crust but failed  horrendously.  Then the waiter when realized I hadn't eaten but 2 bites instead of asking if everything was OK or if could get something else, asked if I needed a box.  Seriously can't believe my husband have a 20% tip (but it's the holidays) and we payed for a meal that wasn't eaten. I would only recommend this place to an enemy.",

They've been heavily advertising their cafe specials, even on TV.  The board right outside the restaurant listed their special 3.99 burger, and a 9.99 steak and shrimp deal.  But the extra menu we got when we were seated had one more:  a half-slab of baby backs, also 9.99.  Since I haven't had ribs in a good couple of years, I went for that.  Mr. G, ever the bargain hunter, had the burger.  And it was a big, thick, juicy burger on a big, thick, shiny bun.  With a ton of fries that were very well done, as he requested.    The ribs were as meaty as any I've ever had, and tender.  Not fall-off-the-bone tender, but soft, flavorful, and not dried out.  Medium-spicy barbecue sauce didn't drown them, but there was just enough.  Two small pieces of corn on the cob and a big baked potato, with a small cup of cole slaw rounded out the dish.    Our waiter, Alfredo, was efficient and obliging, and I couldn't be happier with tonight's dinner at the cafe.  I hope the trend continues.",

This Cafe is open 24/7 a rare find on the \"strip\". We came for breakfast which is served anytime and we were satisfied with the portions of our meals as well as the price.  Grilled ham steak and eggs for $4.99 you really cannot pass up.  Also available are burgers and steaks for a reasonable price point.  The full menu has many more breakfast and sandwich options at higher prices.  My eggs came out perfect as requested and the ham steak was a thick cut with only a little fat near the middle.  They gave me the wrong toast but who cares, if its bread it's all good.   Service was friendly and fun from Linda. A little slow when it came to pay the check but we did not mind because we were just visiting with family.",

On the other hand, our server, Saul, was very nice and kept consistent conversations with my dad whenever he came by. The thing is that my dad is a very impatient dude and it gets frustrating when he keeps on complaining but I'm too tired to tolerate it.   We ordered the cookie in a skillet with ice cream on top for dessert. It was pretty good.  Not sure if I would come back for steak and eggs but only maybe if I'm in the area.",

I try to stick to coming here for lunch or in the early evening dinner but after a concert or night out on the town this cafe is open 24 hours and has pretty good late night specials. While out with some friends and it being after 1 am we decided on coming here.   We were seated right away but as usual because of the hour it was, there was just not enough servers and service was slow. The following prices are from the \"All-Nighter Boarding Pass Specials Menu\" so you will need to have your stations boarding pass handy.   I had the \"2 Egg Bacon Skillet\" priced at $3.99. My bacon was burnt and hard as a red rock (pardon the pun tee-hee) so I passed on eating anymore of the bacon then what I already disgustingly ate. The eggs were good, the hash browns were good even though they didn't add the cheddar cheese I requested when ordering, and the sourdough toast had way too burnt grill marks on certain sides. They did bring the cutest little jelly jars to the table in grape and strawberry. I used one to try and cover the burnt taste of my toast but did keep the others. I figure I can make a PB&J sandwich with it at home which will taste better. My hubby had the \"Short Stack\" priced at $1.99, \"Biscuits & Gravy\" priced at $1.99and a side of sausage. He enjoyed his meal. The pancakes were actually really good and priced perfectly. My friends ordered the \"Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs\" priced at $4.99 and the \"NY Strip Steak & Eggs\" priced at $5.99. We like to sample each others and one of my friends said her chicken fried steak tasted sour. I tried a bite and it had NO flavor. The server was kind enough to remove the charge from the bill. We all shared a \"Tiramisu Cup\" and it was more like a custard with no flavor.   That is all.",

    "text": "My family of three were really craving some good burgers at a reasonable price and Grand Cafe's nachos (which are delish & great value). We were told they were out of nachos. It was a Saturday evening!! I've never eaten at a restaurant in Vegas that ran out of something (even smaller local joints). We ended up ordering the artichoke spinach dip. It was very good. However they literally cut up one pita bread and put it on our plate. After dipping one piece of pita in the dip at least three times to try to make the pita last, we ran out. We asked for more bread & they would have to charge for another pita bread. They wouldn't charge for chips but they were out. So, my son ate the rest (literally half of it left) with a spoon. We ordered burgers and fries with a side of gravy (a southern thing). The meat on the burgers is awful. No flavor! I ordered a blue cheese bacon burger. I could not taste any blue cheese at all! If you order blue cheese, that means you enjoy the flavor! Bacon was tasteless! How does that even happen!?! The bun was really the only good thing. Both my husband and I ended up dipping our burger in ketchup. We don't like ketchup on our burgers! I didn't want to complain because I had already complained about the lack of bread for the appetizer. I mean, this is a big, busy casino cafe! Running out of items and being stingy with the extras! Really? In Vegas? Don't order the country gravy if you are southern! It has no flavor of gravy, only some weird slightly sweet flavor. My poor son has gone to the bathroom 5 times since we left. I loved going to the place. It is so beautiful and the seating is great. Unfortunately, we will not go back!",

    "text": "If I could give this place 0 stars I would! I went in last night around 1230am with some friends after we went to Red Rock to pay bingo. We wanted to try their midnight specials. Our Server DOUG was very rude. We all ordered from the midnight special menu, but he charged my friend the regular daytime price. Then when he brought it to his attention Doug said he would fix it, but charged him triple the amount of the regular price on his card because he was mad. My friend brought the receipt to the manager at the front cashier, and got it all sorted out. After the manager talked to Doug about it, Doug passed by our table and said something along the lines of \"You stupid mother fucker\" while not looking at us under his breathe. How unprofessional and immature can a person get? I've never been so disgusted with service in my life. I'm surprised how he even got the job or even still works there! Besides our horrible server Doug, our food came out after one hour and was not worth the wait. My food was cold, so it was probably sitting in the back for a while before he even brought it out. The restaurant wasn't even busy so I don't know why it took so long. I will never go back here again, and I advise everyone to never go here!  **EDIT: I forgot to mention that the same friend who got charged triple for his food, got his food way after we got our food. The table behind us both ordered what he ordered (only bacon,eggs,and hash-browns), and they got it before him and they were sat thirty minutes after us. Ridiculous!",

Our service was good but not great enough to overcome the mediocre food.   I ordered a Bacon Cheeseburger and it was almost flavorless. Pretty sure they are using hamburger with little to no fat as that is where a lot of a burgers flavor comes from. I don't know what was going on with my pickles but they had a weird flavor that didn't blend well with the rest of the burger.  My GF enjoyed her French Dip but thought it was a rather small serving size.  Best part of the meal was the complimentary bread and the French Fries.   After we had ordered a table next to ours was sat and told about the Daily Specials/or their secret menu.  If you don't see something you like you may want to ask about the Specials as that would have prevented us from ordering the food we did.(maybe need proper training for the wait staff to ensure they have all the food options available to them)  All in all it wasn't bad and if you don't want to wait in the buffet line (the only reason we ended up here) or you want to sit down and have food brought to you it may be right down your alley.",

    "text": "I brought my Mom out for a late Mother's Day dinner and I was not content.   I love the Red Rock Casino. When I drive in from California and don't stay at my moms, I typically stay at the Red Rock. Out of all of the times I've stayed, we've always gone elsewhere to eat for whatever reason.   Don't get me wrong....the food is standard/average. It's not outstanding and delicious like I thought it would be. It's just ok. I wouldn't crave it later or down the road. I probably would've enjoyed in n out way better. I didn't bother yelping it before we were seated. Big mistake!   I also ordered a Cadillac margarita.  Worst cadi I've ever had. No joke! It tasted like a margarita mix on the rocks.   The 2 I'm rating GC is more towards the waiters and hostess and the food wasn't gross. They are very unfriendly.  Our waitress looked as if she just hopped out of bed. The hostess asked me how many? When I responded, she took off. Was I supposed to go with her? Apparently so! I thought people usually communicate with you to guide you.  She came back laughing saying she was waiting.  I was really bothered and told her that as far as I knew the righteous and courteous  thing to say was \"right this way\" or \"sure, follow me\".  When I brought it up to her attention she wanted to laugh. How unprofessional and senseless of the casino to have a restaurant like this inside their premises and staff on top of it representing their hotel.  Just saying....",

I don't know if I would ever come back based on my past two experiences.   The first time the bread on my Roast Beef Sandwich was a bit hard and they forgot my mayo. I didn't mind it much but the Guacamole that they served with my husband's quesadilla was gross. It was really brown ... we were trying to send it back but we were only checked on when they served us the bill.   I decided to give this place another try a couple of days ago and we ended up walking out. We waited about 10 minutes for a seat . When we sat down my husband's side of the booth was still sticky like it hadn't been cleaned. We thought we would just let the waiter know when they come to take our order for our drinks. The waiter never showed up so my husband asked a worker up front if they can please have someone clean our table and possibly get us some drinks. They said \"Sorry it's too busy ..there is nothing we can do\". We ended up going to Rubios instead.   I just read today that Station casinos is looking to hire 1000 workers for new Grand Cafe locations. I just hope they add more people to staff this location because clearly there isn't enough workers to provide a good customer experience!",

They have an amazing late dinner/early breakfast menu that has prices that are impossible to compete with. One server knows my order whenever he sees me and I love that kind of personal service. Some chefs are better than others however and the quality of the food varies from meal to meal but never really \"disappoints\". The best short stack in the world for $1.99 is unbeatable. Not to mention service is incredibly quick. The only night I've seen it otherwise was a holiday weekend when they were swamped by hotel guests. Understandable.    This is a great place to eat if you're a visiting tourist or just with a group of friends late one night at Red Rock. Great for after a movie before you head home for the night.",

Should have left at this point, but we didn't.  Once seated, realized the menu is too long (think uninteresting overpriced Cheesecake Factory, unless you get the specials.)  The service here is terribly slow, and our server had a lot of attitude.  After waiting over an hour, our food finally arrived lukewarm/cold, it appeared the server forgot our food in the back, but she denied the claim.  Then she told my parents off about us complaining to her about the food being cold.  At the end of the meal, the manager at the payment desk discounted one entree off the meal, but I do not feel that was adequate for the lack of quality and service.  Do not eat here!  The Suncoast and Rampart have better restaurants.",

    "text": "I know that casinos, specifically local places, have bigger investments than dining. So basically there is no motivation to offer great food or service when the real draw is blinking and dinging a few feet away. This is definitely the case here.   My parents and I brought my two toddler girls for dinner on a Saturday night, as we live close by and visit the buffet on occasion. It was not too crowded, and there was no wait. Being seated and brought drinks promptly was the end of the positives. My daughters were already pretty hungry and were being distracted with crackers, knowing that there would be a reasonable restaurant wait. Our server came and answered menu questions a bit begrudgingly. She committed our order to memory, and we agree that this meant it would not be right. That was accurate. Everything came out quite slowly, and no used plates were ever cleared before the next course arrived. When the entrees arrived, my mother and 3 year old's were not right and took a very long time to be corrected and delivered. The restaurant could not have known that those were the two people at the table who cannot wait to eat (mom for medicinal reasons, and daughter for toddler reasons), but that is how it landed.   Beyond the service, the food was sub-par for the price. Salad was a standard diner iceberg, and my entree of shrimp and chicken was extremely dry and overcooked. As I inspected the chicken, the odd, random, differently cooked pieces started to resemble scraps at best or salvaged pieces from other people's plates at worst. After that thought came to me, I couldn't finish it. We had all ordered from a special priced 3- course menu, which included dessert. I chose the brownie, which came very dry and old-looking, completely different from the brownies in the case at the front. So they reserve cheap desserts for the meal special, rather than wasting their \"good\" pastries on them.   We ate and it was fine. This place is no global travesty. But no thanks.",

It comes with green chili's, pepper jack cheese, guacamole and a pretty good chipotle mayo. I don't eat cow so I sub in a turkey burger. It's not the best turkey burger in Vegas but it'll do in a pinch. A little dry but it usually is in comparison to a beef patty.  The service is slow and very consistent. It's always slow. Always. I know this going in though so I don't sweat it. If you don't have some time to kill you might want to opt for the feast buffet here instead.

The veggies are steamed and are squash and broccoli which I like. Honestly, for $10 and you don't have to waste time cooking it. Can you beat it with a ugly stick? I sure can't. Service is good and feels too notch. Better than the 2-3x as much John Cutter, for 1/3 the price. The servicio that is. I bet if they sold ribeye here it would be just as good.",

The omelet was big and filled with a lot of stuff but my hash brown was runny.  The coffee was very light where I can practically see through it.  Since  Starbucks doesn't offer the breakfast sandwiches, I was stuck going to this place. It was OK, I didn't mind it.",

I now give it one star because it it unbelievably worse now. They have deleted the specials menu and have a \"daily special\" with one item, Whoop de doo!!! My wife ordered the Pork Chops with country gravy and I ordered Eggs Benedict. I don't know what country this gravy came from but it certainly wasen't the US. Instead of grilled pork chops, they were breaded and deep fried. Yuk - really! Thin sliced,tough and tasteless. My wife ate about 10% of her order and stopped. The bartender offered to get her something else, but she declined. The Eggs Benedict were the absolute WORST I have ever had. Over cooked and burned Canadian Bacon and tasteless Bernaise (sp) sauce. We were there at 11:45 AM and the place was 20% full - no wonder. We sat at the counter and were the only ones there. We went to use our points and that will be the last time for sure. This is a shame since the food used to be pretty good. I don't know what their problem is but someone needs to fix it - quickly.",

I got the California benedict for $10 and that was a total joke.  Small plate portion and I guess the chef doesn't know how to poach eggs either.  Looked like all the regulars were getting salads.  Maybe that's what I'll go for next time although I am pretty sure I am not coming back.  I'd do IHOP over this anytime.",

First of all, it took over and hour and a half for our table of 4 to get our food. The waitress was absent for that entire time, and when the food finally came, we were told that the chef popped one of my poached eggs. First of all, an update would have been nice, as my brother was getting married in a few hours and chose this restaurant based on convenience in the first place. Second of all, unless the chef had to run to the store to get a new egg, that doesn't explain more than 5 minutes of delay. Heck they could have served both of them popped and I wouldn't have cared.  The food was also pretty bad. Eggs Benedict are made or broken based on the Hollandaise sauce, and this one had a very unpleasant chemically taste. I will say that others at the table seemed reasonably satisfied.",

They used to have homemade chips and French onion dip but that's gone now and I don't know why. The food has always been good and the service is really friendly.

But the food quality was not that great, and service was lacking.   I ordered Huevos Rancheros. First of all, it came out looking like a hot, soupy mess suffocated with cheese. I had to send a posse to search for the corn tortillas. They were located at the bottom of the mass, drenched and drowned. No flavor at all. They may well have been made out of construction paper.   If I hadn't read the menu I wouldn't have known there were refried beans in this dish. I mean, were there any? I don't know. The only distinguishable ingredients were the eggs, bell peppers and cheese. Oh, and some \"salsa.\"   Now, to be fair, you shouldn't expect excellent Mexican food at a general cafe-style restaurant, but this was beyond bad.   The waitress pretty much forgot us. Didn't ask if we needed anything. No drink refills, nothing. We had to flag her over a couple of times for minor requests. Just disappointing all the way around.",

The food came on hot a plate but the food itself was lukewarm at best. The lettuce on my sandwich had wilted. The chicken on the pesto pasta was dry and the sauce had solidified. The ranch dressing was watery which turned me off completely. The manager was nice and tried to make it right but after waiting for an hour we didn't have time for the cafe to remake our food. I hope that this place gets it together because some items on the menu are amazing. But between the bad service and the disappointing food experience I think I'll stay away for the time being.  The check came and the managers solution was to give us $6.00 off our check even though every meal in our party was awful. It was as though the meals were under the heat lamp for 30 minutes.",

I think our server name was Caitlyn (I hope I spelled her name right) she was kind and attentive to us. We went here for their breakfast, i had the chicken fried steak, eh it was ok. The only thing I didn't like was the batter, other than that everything was great. We also ordered a greek yogurt parfait and it was the bomb. I had a green tea matcha latte and it was good. My husband ordered chiaquiles and a side of ham, he said it was good too. I'll warn you their portions are pretty big, I'd suggest order one and maybe share it for two. Definitely will come back to try something new.",

Neither the table nor salad came with bread and butter so there was no carbohydrate to fill the stomach.  The desserts in the case look amazing.

We purposefully drove off the strip to go to the Red Rock Casino just to visit and the Grand Cafe looked really welcoming with its fresh pastry display out front and high open, well lit ceilings.  The Grand Cafe even has a lovely Keno hostess who took care of our tickets with the most pleasant and friendly interactions.  We've found several off strip eateries to have tired, indifferent staff, but the Grand Cafe was a refreshing and inviting experience.  Free parking in a covered garage and high open ceilings to minimize the smoking hazard will warrant another trip back to the Red Rock Casino and most definitely more meals at the Grand Cafe.

Returns, again after a long wait, to say out of the beer, no chianti. Takes entree and food orders. Long wait. Soup comes, too few crackers.

    "text": "My husband and I had some time to kill before watching a movie, so we decided to eat breakfast. We first walked to the Feast Buffet, but the lines were crazy long! Decided to try out Grand Cafe next door and we were seated right away.  The food was horrible, for me at least. I ordered the breakfast sliders - 2 sausage, egg and cheese biscuits, gravy, and hash browns. There was no gravy on my plate. The hash browns were cold, and the sliders were a hint of warm in the beginning, but turned cold pretty quickly. I really wanted to complain and send the food back to the kitchen, but I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes to eat. My husband, on the other hand, said that his food was good. This was actually his second visit here. The country breakfast bowl that he ordered each time was tasty and filling. So maybe there are a small number of items on the menu that are worth eating.  Service wasn't that great. Our server did not check on us very often, and she was more attentive to the table across from us. Maybe because there were 3 kids and a baby sitting at that table? The cashiers in the front were more friendly.   I will give this place 2 stars because my husband enjoyed his food, but I won't be returning. I can't believe that sometimes there is a line here during dinner time. Thank goodness for the Yelp check in deal: 1 free entree with purchase of an entree. If I had to pay full price, I would have been upset. DO NOT waste your time and money here! Waiting in line for the buffet would definitely be a wiser choice.",

I guess its no surprise that the Cafe was able to sit us quickly.   The one star is for the nice hostess that had to attend to our needs 3 different times as our waiter who seemed to have all of 4 tables could not have managed to be less attentive.    After getting our drinks fairly quickly we waited 10 more min for our waiter. I could swear he was reading off a script when he spoke to us. No smile, no real engagement, no patience and after taking our order we wouldn't see him again for 40 min when our meals arrived.   After our food arrived he just left. We had to get the hostess to address the overcooked fries that looked like they had been sitting under a heat bulb for quite some time.   We probably spent 20 min eating and during that time I only saw our waiter once who was looking down at the floor and disappeared into the kitchen before I was able to get his attention. Luckily the nice hostess was preparing some tables behind us.   My prime rib was very dry, the fries were dried out, my Au Jus cup looked like half of it may have spilled out and of course I ran out. Overall our food experience was well below average especially for a place that tries to appeal to a slightly more discriminating crowd.   If not for the poor service I probably would not have taken the time to even write a review. Cafe's are a dime a dozen and my food expectations are always low.   Once again Red Rock fails to deliver. I used to love coming here but each new experience seems to diminish my motivation to return.",

    "text": "Quick Look - Avoid at all costs on a busy weekend, they have a tough time keeping with demand in the kitchen. Second time eating here, and second time the order was messed up. Not going to be a third time for a ruined meal experience. Too many choices in this city.   In Depth Review: Decided to eat here on a Sunday in late April. We arrived to Red Rock at 12pm and the place was slammed. There were easily 300+ people waiting in line for the brunch buffet (shocking). We were taken back to find that there was even a line for the Grand Cafe. Even had the velvet ropes set up that you would find at a busy Vegas nightclub (ridiculous). After a 10 minute wait we were sat. Waitress took another ten minutes to greet us and take our drink order, we over looked that and she seemed nice. We placed our orders, nothing crazy - Eggs Benedict, Mediterranean Egg Frittata & Short Stack Pancakes (side).   So the wait begins, almost an hour after we placed our order, 45 minutes after the butter and syrup was brought to the table, the plates arrive. The eggs Benedict is ice cold, the hash-browns on the side undercooked and mushy. The Mediterranean Frittata was cold, the English Muffin on side Luke-warm. The only item up to par was the pancakes. So we were a little upset, and asked for them to please remake the eggs and serve us hot food. Cold cooked eggs is not what we wanted. The waitress said the kitchen was slammed and that the manager was helping plate the items and that she would speak with them. She also suspected that the pre-poached eggs Benedict was to blame. They are NOT cooked fresh to order apparently.   The female manager came out about ten minutes later to apologize and blamed it on 600 people checking out of the hotel at once. Said she would comp a round of drinks for us for our troubles (whatever). So we placed a drink order with waitress, guess what? That was also messed up. Sent over a drink we did not even order. We are having some bad luck, it was becoming laughable. Then the food comes out, and the Benedict is still not cooked properly, and the side of hash-browns is still undercooked and mushy. The Frittata was fine but my appetite was gone. At this point we just asked for the check. They comped the round of drinks (big deal). We paid, still left a nice tip (waitress was very pleasant) and promptly left.   Side Note: Our first visit to here was mid-week, about a month ago. The restaurant was empty on that visit, somehow the waitress ordered me food that I did not ask for. It was an honest mistake and they corrected it. It still demonstrated that they have some issues to deal with at the Grand Cafe.   In Summary: We were willing to overlook an issue with our first visit and give it a second chance. After yesterdays poor showing, there will be a third visit here. Like I said above, there are way too many options in this city.   Hopefully Station Casinos will take notice and make corrective action. Especially after reading the other poor reviews online. They are not the best, and what a beautiful casino like Red Rock should be comfortable with. It's a nice restaurant and has potential. Right now it's not living up to the standards of this resort.",

    "text": "It was a fun evening at the Grand Opening of Downtown Summerlin, but every food joint at the place was absolutely packed so we decided to wait it out until the light show was over to grab a bite.  First of all, 2/3 of the permanent restaurants were still not open so choices were limited to begin with.  By the time the show was over, most of the food trucks started to close so we decided to just head over to Red Rock Resort and grab a bite.  We've always wanted to try the cafe for their daily deals, so that was our objective.  The $9.99 daily special was the bbq tri-tip, so we ordered one of those and the everyday special T-bone steak, also at $9.99.  What we got was ample - meat with mashed potatoes and corn-on-the-cob, and T-bone with baked potato and steamed veggies - for a $10 meal.  The taste was typical diner, sort of reminiscent of highway diners actually.  Meats were not bad, not good, obviously not the best cut but just fine taste-wise.  The sides were better - both potatoes were good, corn was a bit bland, and veggies looked like they came from frozen bags but still as good as any other steamed frozen veggie.  And the bbq sauce was really good.  Altogether not a bad $10 deal.  Our server was really nice, pretty speedy with what we requested but did forget to bring our forks on first request.  Easy to forgive, since he always wore a smile and was always positive.  Probably less then 3-stars for the food, but the service and generally relaxed atmosphere deserves rounding up.  Not sure we'd go back for the food though, or maybe we'll try some non-meat dishes when we're hungry late-night.  Table-for-1 Factor:  As with any casino cafes, if you can't eat alone here you can't eat alone anywhere.",

We both got specials which were reasonably priced. Service was good, apparently better than others on recent visits. My trout was delicious. The veggies would have been good but they were drenched in butter. The salad was fresh and a generous portion. Hubby's steak was okay. His mashed potatoes were too good; I wanted to eat them. It is much prettier than Santa Fe's Grand Cafe. Good value for a local casino and nice change of pace from the buffet. However, we probably won't go back without the coupon.",

Enrique is fucking fabulous. He was so sweet and was fixing the kitchens mistakes w poise. He was very thoughtful and smiling and even though it was so busy when our baby was crying it was basically drowned out by the hustle and bustle. We a had a really lovely meal. The food was great. The details were there as if it were Monday morning. Bravo to everyone who worked that shift and Enrique who at the end told us he just started 2 weeks before. So if anyone reads this and Enrique is your waiter. Be nice and give him a big tip. :)",

I ordered the Mediterranean frittata (it had egg whites, fresh sliced tomatoes, basil, and feta cheese). It was PERFECT  just the right size if you're looking for something  to fill your stomach and doesn't weigh you down. It also came with fresh toasted whole wheat English muffins which was a warm fluffy plus!!. Also we didn't want to wait so we ate at the bar-- the bartender who said she was new did a great job and we we were never left unattended. The food came out a very reasonable time.  What a great end to a fun night!",

We were sat immediately upon arrival and the restaurant was quite busy. The busser took out drink order right away. We received our drinks within 3 minutes. The waitress came over next and took our order. She offered her recommendation of Eggs Benedict. My father took her recommendation of the Eggs Benedict. His eggs came out with the white part very runny. The muffin was perfect and very large. The Canadian Bacon was thin sliced and very generous. The Hollandaise Sauce tasted like it was from scratch and had a very good taste.  I had a Denver Omelette with Mushroom and Chicken Sausage added to it. Overall the omelette was good. However the put a lot of onion in it and not enough bell pepper. The consistency was on point with the exception of the onion. The hash browns were cooked to perfection and had a nice buttery taste. When we checked out with the cashier she was friendly and even offered up some to go pastries.  Not much to brag about here. This is the standard Station Casino Cafe breakfast. I have paid less money for better breakfast's elsewhere.  So if your looking for friendly service with a basic standard breakfast, this will do it.",

    "text": "I've been coming to Grand Cafe for many years as my late night go to place.  I've never had a problem until tonight when my mother was in town visiting and we went.   The lineup was 25 minutes long, no big deal but the obvious sign of trouble was the lineup at the register to pay.  I watched a party wait over 15 minutes for someone to come and take payment.  After we were seated for 30 minutes with no sign of a server, flagged down someone named John whom I assume might have been management.  Eventually an hour later, our food arrives.  I had asked for a Pepsi, I got diet.  He came around again, I asked for a regular Pepsi, again - diet!  I did not touch it.  Went to pay, told them I never got my Pepsi.  The young guy taking payments disappeared for 5 minutes with my credit card and brought the server over.  I told him, you've yet to give me a Pepsi, so they go in the back and talk in the back room.  The young guy comes out, presses a bunch of buttons and says this should be right and presents me with a visa receipt and I sign.  I ask for my itemized copy, and he added a Diet Pepsi to the bill - now two drinks!   Really?!  I went to the cage and they call a pit boss and I explained to her, I did not get a Pepsi, the guy kept serving me Diet Pepsi!  She went in to the Grand Cafe and had them remove the added drink.  Thanks Laura for correcting this, that is the only reason I'm not rating 1 star, she made good on this after they thought it was a joke.  Unfortunately, I won't be back.  This was very embarrassing bringing my mother here to get such poor service.  6 people working 15 tables at 2am and they couldn't keep up.  I also have moral issues with someone tampering with my bill, claiming it's correct after we just had the discussion.  Update:  thank you Mikhail, this was definitely not the norm I've come to expect from Red Rock.  Hoping for the best next time too",

After a few moments she returned and told us we could be seated at a booth in the back, but that no server was on the clock for that station for 15 minutes. We said that wasn't a problem but quickly realized as we were walked to our seat, that there were plenty of available tables, I'm assuming we were put in the car back corner because we had children with us. The food was lackluster. The whites on the eggs Benedict were very runny, the hash browns were cooked on one side, raw on the other. Our waitress was very friendly, once she arrived. Not a lot of options in the casino for breakfast, but not sure I'd eat here again.",

Our waiter Carl came by to take our order and I told him I really wanted a French dip. Without skipping a beat, he said no problem. We can do a Philly ( take or add what u want to it) and add au jus on the side. We got their bread pudding French toast which was AMAZING too.  I was in awe. The customer service Carl has shown me was truly phenomenal. Our drinks were constantly filled. And he made sure it was all to my liking. This was a wonderful experience. The cafe has a wide variety of options including Lattes and desserts if you choose.   The wait is typical for a cafe in a casino. The staff is always very friendly and courteous. This isn't your typical type ma & pa cafe. Their take on traditional food is infused with a modern flare.",

The Manager Cindy, was walking by & inquired to why my disappointed expression. A quick chat took place between us, she gave me a refund & kindly requested that I return when I had the time to give Grande Cafe another chance. She even wrote my name down incase she was already gone for the day when I returned.   The next day during the conference beak I decided to come back. I stated my name, waited a good ten minutes, tripled checked my order & deliciously devoured the Impossible Vegan Burger...the BEST Vegan Burger I have tasted thus far.  Not only did Cindy, exude her fantastic managerial skills, her leadership really spoke for itself.  Her staff from the Hostess, Bartender, Cashier & even the Executive Chef made an extra effort to ensure my do-over was a success. So much as I came back for another one before flying back home.   Good to see the effort in ensuring positive customer service is a priority. Cindy, great luck on your team's upcoming Breast Cancer Walk, I'm rooting for you all from the DMV.

    "text": "Grand Cafe @RedRock Casino  I usually don't take the time to write reviews but the service I received at the Grand Cafe (Red Rock) warrants notice.  It's Christmas Eve and my family decided to stay in the room for breakfast so I went down to the restaurant to order some food To Go.  We got the following: - California Omelet - French Toast - Side of Fruits - Onion Rings - English Muffin - Orange Juices  Total: $71.00  Problem #1 (Waiting) I waited over 1 hour to get my food. I understand that it's busy so my order could take some time, but waiting for over an hour is ridiculous.  Problem #2 (Cold Food) I finally get my bags of food and return back to my room. We open the bags and find the food are all cold. At this point I am guessing that the food was timely prepared but the younger girl at the counter did not take the time to see if my food was ready and let it sit somewhere. I asked her twice during the hour I was waiting but both times she replied that it was not ready...I took her word for it but that was a mistake. Next time, if there is a next time, I will demand (every 10 mins) that she check with the kitchen staff.  Problem #3 (Missing Condiments and Utensils) They did not give us any condiments. No butter, no maple syrup, no jam, no salt, no pepper...should these be automatically included or at least ask about it? If you plan on getting food to go, treat the staff  like robots and always ask to check for condiments that should come with the food. Also, I specifically told the order taker that it was four people but apparently that meant nothing to her, we only received three sets of utensils.   Problem #4 (No Teamwork) Absent utensils and condiments, I make the trek back to the restaurant. I tell the cashier that I was given cold food and they did not provide condiments and utensils, she tells me that I need to find the girl that took and prepared my bags and points to the kitchen. I am puzzled why I need to find chase down a staff but I decide to not raise a fuss and just try to find her so I can go eat my cold food.   At this point, the manager steps in and tries to help. I can see she is genuinely trying by re-making the Omelet and the French Toast but I end up waiting another 20 mins.  Oh, my Side of Fruit was missing also...  *Bottom Line* 1. Don't expect this restaurant staff to properly provide anything that comes with your food. 2. Don't expect any assistance from the cashier girls. if you have issues with your order. Ask for the manager directly.",

My California Omelette was cooked perfectly but my husbands Over-Easy Eggs were hard boiled when he cut into them.  Spaghetti & Meatballs: Meatballs tasted decent being that they're not homade. Probably Frozen? Sauce needed Salt & flavor. Just tasted like it was right out of the can. A little chintzy with the noodles. Wouldn't get it again. On the bright side, the Garlic bread was really good. Crispy & Garlicky but still light & fluffy.  Side Cesar Salad - Zesty but overdressed. Romaine hearts started to wilt quickly. I would get it again but ask for the dressing on the side.  I would still come back as a convenient place to eat within the Casino.",

    "text": "Not a bad option if you're hungry and everything else is closed . . . Grand Cafe is about on par with Denny's (bonus for having a full bar, full menu all day, and open 24hrs). Denny's has better prices.   The menu covers the gamet of food groups from pancakes, eggs, sandwiches, salads, burgers, wings, steak, and desserts. Unfortunately, they don't do any of these particularly well. Breakfast is solid but pricey for what you get. Traditional breakfast plates like bacon and eggs are on the lighter side. The cafe makes up for it by throwing on a 1/2lb of hash browns to fill you up.  Otherwise, there are other options in house. Yard House is family friendly, serves great food, and is open late (not open for breakfast). Fat Burger opens early 9-2 week days and 8-3 on weekends. This is the place for your burger fix. Their breakfast sandwiches are hard to beat too. Rubio's and Capriotti's have breakfast until 10 as well. They're a reasonable value for the money.  If none of these suits your needs, BJs, Olive Garden, Island Burger, and Distill are a 5 minute walk across the street in the Canyon Pointe shopping center. Distill's kitchen is 24hrs, and they have excellent breakfast options.  If you have comps, casino points, or you just don't want to walk past the elevators, Grand Cafe is your place. If not, walk a little further for better food and better value.",

    "text": "So, we just finished a meal here; we were in a hurry to find my niece anything to eat so the least busy place in Red Rock seemed a good choice, I mean how bad could they be.  Well...  As soon as we arrived and told a young hostess we wanted a table for 7 problems arose. My recollection was she said they don't seat parties of our size because they don't have the right table for us (put two 4-top tables together honey...geez). We agreed to be separated as 3 & 4 top tables but the hostess decided to seat people behind us who aren't t even CHAIRMAN first (3 groups to be exact); they were regular folk like us. It's possible the ropes to separate VIP guests and regular guests were demented, it made no sense till after we finished our meals.  I assume the more polished hostess, who just started her shift, fixed it and arranged the ropes wisely.  Anyway, a second hostess finally seated us (separately). i asked her why we couldn't be seated in a section where the tables were open; she replied that the section was close.  Wow!!! So you're telling me if a group of 20 walked in with money to burn you wouldn't  seat them because the section is closed. It's not like the section or tables were reserved, just that no server was assigned that area. GET A SERVER TO TAKE THE TABLE MANAGEMENT!  Where were you guys anyways?  Ten minutes after being seated I kind of took it out on our server, Debra, with a grumpy and sad attitude for our mishaps. It did take quite some time for us to be greeted at the table or get a glass of water, but I shouldn't have because she was a pretty decent person and server.  Debra asked how we were and I replied truthfully and said not so well. We told her the story and her reaction was what I'd expect most people in the industry to react...shocked.  I jokingly asked her not to do anything funny to my food (it really does happen people, I worked in restaurants; I'm not saying it happens here but just saying, you never know). Never complain about staff until after your meal arrives; God forbid you ever have to return anything to a closed kitchen.  Debra was a good sport though and a good server; she directed us to the manager-on-duty Kim a little later.  Meanwhile.... Right next to us, they were putting two tables together to seat 7 people. WHAT THE HELL! REALLY...Yup, slap #1 on us.  We told Kim about it and she was amazed that happened too.  We just gave constructive feedback for her to tell the hostess. She said she was going to give us a discount or dessert for what happened but that never really happened so I'll leave my criticism of Kim with a BIG FAT QUESTION MARK; who knows if she will even train the hostesses correctly and let them know of their poor performance. Besides, we don't care about freebies, although they're nice.  Just fix what needs fixing, please!  Anyhow, the 7 people that sat next to us were a perfect White American family so i had to ask if there was something wrong with us (you know, being minorities and all), at least she answered wisely.  It does bring about good questions about the incident though. Hmmmm....  My food finally came.  NY steak and eggs (MR, OE, S). The sourdough toast wasn't toasted; my steak was rare and just seared outside, and my eggs were over-medium.  Food was just OK; I wonder if they rushed it or the chef got annoyed with the hurry order. I wonder if they.....?  Meanwhile... That closed section, miraculously opened. They sat 4 next to us there (slap #2) and 15 minutes later they setup for a 6-top in that same closed section a few tables over (slap #3).  OMG! It had to be us. Who knows, don't care!  This place bites.  I doubt it will ever get better.  Here's a thought, let's train our employees before we feed them to the lions; they're lucky they slapped a bunch of kittykats instead of lions who would have chewed them up and spit them out.",

    "text": "I've been here at least a dozen times now always after 12AM for their late night menu. And every time I order the same thing: steak and eggs + pancakes. However, recently I was in for an unwelcome surprise when I ordered my usual menu item. The steak was so dry and ironically after I had praised the steak for being so good to the server and especially at the price point of 6 dollars. Moreover, they raised the price to $7.50 but the quality of the steak went DOWN!  I relayed this message to the server and she told me that they had to raise the price because they were losing money on the steak and eggs... but it's disappointing that they also lowered the quality significantly possibly by buying cheaper cuts. To find out if this was just a fluke, I ordered 2 more steaks on different days including tonight, and sure enough the steaks were dry and I had difficulty chewing despite having them cooked medium-rare. Very disappointing change.  Locale- Located inside Red Rock Hotel/Casino, it has very nice decor with classy chandeliers and comfortable booths. The place is well designed and looks like a place that serves more expensive food.  Food- Reading the other reviews on here, it seems my mediocre experience is the norm. Only a few weeks ago the steaks were great. I can't pinpoint exactly what has changed since I don't work there, but the quality change is objectively there. I've eaten quality steaks but I'm not expecting Grand Cafe to be like SW, Prime, or Gordon Ramsay. I just want my old steaks back that aren't dry despite being cooked medium-rare so I can have my late-night fix again. Otherwise I will have to consider Tuscany or some of the other steggs places in town.  Price- The late-night menu is very good value. I wouldn't come here otherwise. I'm actually afraid to order something from the regular menu because if it's the same quality but more than twice as expensive, I don't think I could pay for my food considering my recent experiences.  Service- I've always had a great experience. Fast, friendly, and accomodating. The manager once discounted our meal because they ran out of hashbrowns.  TLDR;- Ambience- 4/5 (classy, well-designed, comfortable) Food- 1/5 (I don't know what happened to my old non-dry steaks) Service- 5/5 (fast, friendly, accomodating) Overall- 3.3/5 (Not what it used to be)",

    "text": "Upon consideration, the name of this restaurant is very fitting.  The pastry counter in front reminds you of a diner.  The vaulted ceilings, dark wood furnishings and crisply uniformed staff contrast with the menu which is just bread and butter cafe food.  The signs outside the casino used to advertise a $3.99 breakfast, but they stopped offering it the month before we visited at the end of June according to our waiter.  Without the shelter of a special, the prices are a little high for the caliber of meals served here ($10 - 11  per dish without including tip).  $10.49 for the shrimp cocktail.... whuuuuut???     My family tried the burgers with and without fries, belgian waffle with eggs and bacon and I had the Mediterranean frittata with a dry whole wheat English muffin.  The staff were very polite and brought our orders out in short time, but nothing about the frittata thrilled me.  They bake it in a small skillet and serve feta, spinach and tomato slices on top with a scattering of some bitter tasting sprouts and an overly honeyed muffin.  If they hadn't fixed on coming here I would have preferred the food court or some tortellini en brodo from Terra Rossa.  It also pays to check the tab when you get it.  We got charged for some sliders we never ordered and my aunt, while she found the total on the high side, didn't notice the mistake until she happened to glance at it after her visit.  Summary:  Grand ambience, grand prices for pedestrian quality food.",

The reviews on this place aren't the best but I still enjoy it and if there's a long wait you can seat yourself right at the bar which has no wait time at all. It's actually a fun spot to chat with the bartenders who are always great and just enjoy your food.  Breakfast is always great here with perfectly crispy bacon, hash browns, fresh eggs and toast that comes with whipped butter and a selection of jellies. I prefer strawberry & lay it on :) The actual restaurant is very pretty with lots of nice details & yes it's always busy especially in the evenings. I always say that's a good sign. The service is good and I wouldn't say they are the fastest so don't come here if you're in a rush. I prefer to enjoy myself & take my time... Overall it's a great place with a good traditional menu and the prices aren't too bad. I come here all the time to grab breakfast for dinner.",

When cutting my steak, there was water under there, as if it was defrosting. The eggs were really slimey and undercooked, that i was worried I was going to get sick. They went downhill and I was really disappointed. My stomach kind of hurt throughout the night. Raised their prices, but lowered their standards. I won't be back again, especially when there are other places with way better steak and eggs.",

I finished my dinner an hour ago on this Saturday night and couldn't wait to get back in the room because my stomach started turning so I couldn't tolerate to stay out even though it was a night I anticapted.   FIRST OFF : I mistaked this for \"Grand Luxe Cafe\" because the whole visual theme was the same but I realized it wasnt the same since the menu prices were so much lower.   SERVICE: Beyond careless & slow.  FOOD: When the entree finally came it was horrid. FYI, its been very rare in my life that I ever have them take my food back so it had to be really bad for me to go there. My friend was quite the whole time because he hated the tasteless weird tasting food but finally said something too. When we decided to ask for management is when it got worse. We explained to the female manager and we both appologized for complaining because we understand the F&B industry. But man her reply was surreal! We didnt even mention about the poor customer service but my other friend that came in the past simply asked what happened to the food? He said it usex to be good. The manager replied \"Well I eat here everyday and its fine\"..... wth kind of statement is that?  BOTTOM LINE IS THEY HAVE HORRID SERVICE & POOR QUALITY FOOD. OUR FOOD WAS NOT CHARGED BUT MY GOD THAT EXPERIENCE WAS NOT WORTH EVEN TO GET PAID FOR!",

Depending on the time of day, expect to wait quite a while to be seated. Unless you're eating in the middle of the night - anywhere close to meal time you'll stand in a long line to wait for seating.  They have a great outdoor patio that faces the pool area. It's beautiful! But if you sit out there be willing to wait even longer for a server. We ate there for breakfast this morning. It took an hour to get seated, and then another 15 mins for our server to come over. He was attentive in placing our order and getting drinks, but our food took another half hour to come out. He didn't bring salt or pepper and we had to wait another 5 mins for him to come back and check on us. The food was good, although they put the wrong cheese in my omelette (was supposed to be goat cheese and they put cheddar - WAY different). When our server brought our check he never fame back for it. We waited and waited and finally took our bill inside to pay.  As a side note, they always have 3 daily specials for boarding pass members (Red Rock player's card holders) - one breakfast, one lunch, one dinner. Today's breakfast special was 2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon, hash-browns and toast for $3.99. Dinner was Salisbury steak and potatoes for $9.99 - not too bad.",

Our food server was a blonde lady by the name of Vicky Lynn (something like that) she took our order and that was it as far as conversation goes .  She drops off our food, Burger / fries, steak /shrimp.. My husband likes ketchup with his fries and the dinky little squirt she brought him in a ramekin wasn't anywhere near enough .. She  proceeded to drop the plates off without saying one word , no \"is there anything else you'd like or need ?\" No \"if you need anything let me know \" NOTHING , NADA!!  Never came by to check on us or refill drinks much less ask if we needed anything . Walked by us a million times but that was it, she dropped off food at the table next to us and my husband was trying to get her attention to get more ketchup and refills , no luck there , she drops the plates off picks up her tray and jack and poof! She was gone .. We got up to leave since she never came by with our check , as we were leaving we saw some friends said a quick hello, again she passed by us and said nothing , little did I know she was dropping off our check with the cashier. As we went to pay the cashier asked her for the check and all she said \" I left it right there \" pointing to the counter top, no \"thank you\" nada , not a flipping word .. We've had bad service once before with another waitress a few years ago and we didn't complain then we just left and didn't go back for a long long time , this time we complained and the Mrg Michael just seemed to make excuses for her and offered us the cheapest dessert they have , 2 chocolate covered strawberries , now keep in mind this server never said one word to us until she she saw us talking to her manager , then and ONLY then did she come up and apologized for her shitty service , I felt like telling her to F-off but I didn't , we just stiffed her and left .. That's it we're done .. We go out to eat and spend good money only to receive shitty ass piss poor service ! Yeah that's the last time we'll give them our business .. They don't care and they don't our business ... So just so you know this particular server sucks ! And btw I waited tables too so I'm a bit more patient than those who haven't !!",

That is a good thing on many occasions. Since Grand Cafe is 24 hr. (located within Red Rock hotel) limiting intake is good late at night. We had their salad. I like it just as much as I like CPK's salads, I was pleasantly surprised. I tried the Cobb on day 1 and the Mexican a few days later. All chopped and tossed with generous toppings (i.e. chicken).  They also had a three for 9.99 special (confirm timing of specials on your own--we were there on the weekend at 11pm lol). Any way, this 9.99 special which, we did not order, includes an appetizer, entree of spaghetti and meatballs, and a dessert.  The late night staff were friendly and attentive. I didn't have the same positive experience lunch a few days later, oh well. I would go again for the salads--you'll be surprised. Good portion size and reasonable price for the content and when you compare it to the comparable CPK or Sammy's salad.  **Lastly, if you fill out the survey on your receipt you get $5 off your next visit.**",

It had NOTHING to do with the food which was overall decent but we had one of the worst servers in the world. I don't even know where to begin...  1. The wait was a little longer than I would have expected after 10pm. 2. When we were sat our server did not arrive for at least 15 minutes. All she could've done was stop by the table and say something like \"be with you gals in a minute\" aka table-touch. 3. When she finally arrived she had a tray with water and just took our orders. There was no intro or \"Hi, my name is...\". She almost looked \"irritated\" with us. 4. As we were placing our ordera my sister asked if she should order dessert now or if we were to do it later [since we ordered a pre-fixe-esque 3 course meal] and the server's response was \"you can either get the cheesecake or chocolate cake!\". Uhhhh that's not what we wanted to know.....we CAN read lady.... 5. Our quesadilla and salad arrived shortly yet the 2 glasses of chardonnay we ordered had not arrived. When our server finally came around I was about to ask where our wines were but before I could say anything she said, \"WE DON'T HAVE SALSA\". I looked at her calmly and said, \"That's not what we wanted..we just want to know where our wine is.\" She then walks away and puts in our drink order. There was no apology or \"I'll get that right away\" from her. Thanks lady we've been waiting 15 minutes.... 6. Our food took an eternity to arrive [~30 minutes] and when it had arrived my order was wrong. I told my sister to go ahead and eat up since she was hungry and I calmly waited for our server to come around so I could fix my order. 15 minutes passed and my sister was practically finished with her meal. I spotted my server and went up to let her know my order was wrong. When I walked up to her she just looked at me from the corners of her eyes and I told her, \"there was mayo on my sandwich\". She said she'd get me another. 7. You figure that if an order comes out wrong you would make it on the fly and get it out immediately. This was not the case. I waited an additional 15-20 minutes for my club sandwich and when it arrived she just set it in front of me and walked away. She immediately turned around and asked for our ketchup and I said, \"No. I'm using it\". 8. By this time I wasn't hungry and ate 1/4 of my sandwich and a few fries. I figured we should place our dessert orders now so we wouldn't have to wait 4 more hours for that to come out. Our server came by and we told her what we wanted. We also told her we wanted boxes for leftovers.  9. Another 15-20 minutes pass and we see her walking back and forth but there was no sign of our desserts or boxes. My sister who was PISSED the entire meal [and whom I tried to stop from complaining] lost it and went to look for a manager. After a brief explanation of our dining experience the manager brought out our cakes and boxes in under 5 minutes. He apologized and gave us a discount which was unnecessary but appreciated. He was incredibly nice and accommodating.  10. We just wanted to get out of there so we grabbed our leftovers and went to pay. While we walked up to the cashier our server stopped us and asked, \"how things were\" and then was like \"OH! I forgot to order your cakes\" and on top of that she looked at us like we were going to dine-n-dash. I ignored her the entire time and just said, \"everything was fine\" and walked away. 11. We left irritated and wasted so much time there. What a shitty way to start our trip. By the way we still tipped her which she did not deserve in any way. I should have just handed it to the busser who was working a lot harder than she was.  We've eaten at the other establishments in the hotel and received FANTASTIC service. We will probably visit the hotel again but if we ever come back to the Grand Cafe we will specifically ask to NOT be sat in that servers section.",

We had to wait for about 20 minutes in a noisy area of the casino reeking of second hand smoke.   Once inside the Grand Cafe, the service was excellent.   The decor and noise level were fine.   Our waitress was extremely friendly and left us with a whole carafe of coffee.    The breakfasts were ok.   I had a french toast sandwich, that sounded good, but I would not order again.    My wife had ham steak and poached eggs and that was good, but nothing special.    We probably will not go back.",

It was close to 2 a.m. and you'd think that they would be on the ball, as it wasn't that busy.  It took a while to seat us, which was alright, because there were 10 in our party.  We sat down and checked out the late night menu.  I just wanted potatoes, that's it! I had a taste for potatoes.  I know, late night starch and carbs.  But, I already have screwed up my diet for the week, so I didn't care.  They had a great late night special. 2 eggs, hash-browns and toast for $1.99.  What a deal!  Anyhow, we ordered drinks and for some reason the kitchen was backed up.  The night manager came to our table to let us know that.  So, the wait was about 1/2 hour.  I didn't mind... I can be a bit of a night owl at times.  But, Roger and Rhia had their kids in tow, so I felt for them.  You could tell that the wait was getting long because Roger passed out.  The food eventually came out and it was good.. about what I could cook at home, but for 2 bucks it couldn't be beat.  2 stars because the waitress was nice and the company was great.  Plus the little jelly jars were awesome.",

They keep changing the staple menu items with smaller and lower quality products. They have stopped providing a variety of individual jars of jam with breakfast and now bring you a plate with portioned out jam, butter, and catsup.  All of which look like they have been shelved for a while prior to making it to your table. The ham steak platter, which was one of my favorites is now served in a skillet that makes everything taste like metal and the \"ham steak\" now has the texture of something you would find in the processed deli isle of the grocery store. And forget asking for anything to be prepared a certain way, your requests seem to fall on deaf ears. Sad, used to be a quality meal and a decent price. Now it's just a run of the mill diner experience.",

Despite living in Vegas for the past 8 years, I've never eaten here.  The aesthetics of the cafe were pretty well done. The cafe didn't feel dirty at all. It felt \"premium.\"  I was pleasantly surprised to learn that there was a $9.99 T-bone steak special. We got two of those, plus the daily special of stuffed pork chops and a cheeseburger. The steaks came with mashed potatoes and assorted vegetables and were cooked to medium rare perfectly. The stuffed pork chops came with mashed potatoes and green beans. The burger came with fries.  All of the food was pretty good. Nothing tasted frozen (except the fries, which obviously were). The portions were pretty big.  When we got there, our waitress was attentive. When our waters came without lemons like I asked, she noticed and quickly got lemons to us.  However, I do have to dock them 1 star because I asked for a baked potato for my steak, but I got mashed potatoes. I didn't want to make a big deal since I like them both. They would have probably corrected the mistake had I told them about it.  If the cafe still has the specials, especially the T-bone steak special, I'll keep coming.",

Next, our waiter VINCENZO came to offer to take our order and he was very nice and personable.  He is a new addition and he is great for the grand cafe .  Ok so we waited for nearly an hour for our breakfast which my daughters was not completely cooked.  My hash browns had a hair in them which I ignored because we already just had sent back her omelette.  I didn't eat my omelette because it was like eating a mouthful of slime.  So I decided to try the pancakes instead which also had a hair in it!!!! I was done.  This restaurant changed their menu and it is less than desirable.  My boys however did enjoy their scrambled eggs and sausage with French toast.  You can get much better food much cheaper elsewhere.  Two stars because the waiter Vincenzo was good.",

I was in a time crunch to get a shuttle reservation at 10:40, my waiter tells me there is at least 15 min wait for food and suggests the oatmeal is quick, I say ok because I really shouldn't be eating bacon and pancakes anyway. Probably waited almost 15 mins for the oatmeal anyway, it was horrible. The flavor of bland plastic and chemicals comes to mind, its total slop. Dried cherries and brown sugar are the ONLY thing saving it and helping me to choke it down so I'm not starving until lunchtime. Mimosa was decent. Even though I am aware they are really busy the service is still unacceptably bad and its obvious that is bad for every table. Took way too much time to swipe a credit card when the register was practically next to my table and the waiter was standing there the whole time. At least I didn't spend a lot of money on a depressingly unhealthy meal.  The breakfast foods walking by, pancakes, waffles, bacon, eggs, huge fried chicken slathered in gravy, all looked good but I'm not so sure they really would be. Just don't get the oatmeal and don't go here if you are in a hurry on a Saturday or Sunday morning.",

To rate the service; I give that a 1/5.  Our server's name was Robert and he was the worst we encountered so far.  He didn't do anything directly negative to us; but the fact that he didn't do anything to help us at all except serve our food.  We sat down and he greeted us with his name with an awkward attitude.  Honestly, we didn't expect a cheerful attitude.  But we did to see a little freshness in his blank expression and tone.  We ordered our food as soon as he came back with our drinks.  A southwest breakfast bowl, angus beef sliders, and a chicken fried steaks with eggs.  Around 15 minutes Robert comes by to tell us that it will just be a few more minutes.  Then another 10 minutes rolls by and our food comes out with the server not saying anything except \"Plate's hot\" and \"Enjoy\".  He did come by and ask how he were; but I won't give him points on that since that's pretty much mandatory for every table.  Nearly 10 minutes into our meal he drops off our check and just leaves not to be seen again.  We didn't know if we were supposed to pay up front or to wait for him so I had to ask the busboy to check where and for a box to wrap up my food.  When we payed up front the nice cashier asked us if we enjoyed our meal and we told her that it was all right but we would like to fill out a comment card.  She attempted to call over her manager but we declined saying that we waited long enough and didn't feel like waiting anymore.  I appreciate the cashiers attempt to rectify the situation; but Robert's attitude towards us has no excuse.  If you're reading this Robert; you deserve the fact that I left you without a tip.  If you're a customer that ends up with Robert, please do what I didn't and tell him or the manager what he did wrong if he doesn't change.",

Took a good 5 minutes for a server, 10 minutes for 2 teas and a coffee and another 10 for 3 pastries from the display case. Hot teas were watery with very little flavor. Mentioned to both server and manager with no real apology. As locals there are too many competitors to keep giving our money to this dump!",

This is a classic coffee shop with a streamlined menu of salads, sandwiches, complete meals and breakfast, all served 24 hours a day.   The kitchen is inconsistent with their preparation and ingredients. I've ordered the chicken Cobb salad three different times and each time it is different! This last visit the chicken was really good, big chunks of fresh chicken breast. Other times it has been shredded chicken breast. Sometimes you get slices of tomatoes, other times you get cherry tomatoes or diced tomatoes. Just weird. At least the ingredients are high quality. The side salad even has freshly shredded carrots. Nice!  Remember, this is a tourist-based restaurant in a casino. That means prices are high! Expect the $10 range for a burger and the $13 range for a salad. They have a captive audience and they know it. They send out coupons to locals so that's why I eat here once in a while.  Check out the dessert case by the register for some good pastries that aren't (surprisingly) way overpriced. I have a hard time resisting them. They also serve my favorite: Illy coffee!",

I had various dishes from their Eggs Benedict to their regular 3 eggs with bacon, sausage and hash brown dish. Lately, I ordered a vegetable omelet dish. The omelet was runny and the cheese overpowered the eggs. It's kind of hard to pinpoint what it is that's lacking in their meals. I'm not sure if they entirely follow their recipes either.   Moving right along, the French toast is decent, but their waffle is dry from the crust down the middle. Their pancakes a bit tasteless without the syrup. And the syrup has the consistency of water.   The last we came, I actually returned a whole carafe of coffee. It tasted as if it came from the bottom of the barrel and cheap roast. But again, the previous days, the coffee was really good.   The ambiance is nice, but staff are also inconsistent in attentiveness.",

Music from the casino can be heard from inside the restaurant and also the slot machines whirring.   The service is fast, and our server, E.G., is very friendly and accommodating.

Horrible customer service and blatant cutting corners due to laziness have made sure that I will not be returning.   I originally ordered my steak medium with the eggs over medium. The first time my food came out the eggs were scrambled, which I let slide. However, despite the indicator stating medium the steak was severely well done. I sent the plate back to which I received no apology from the server, who seemed as though he couldn't care less. Within 2 minutes a gentlemen in a suit, presumably the manger, came out with a \"medium\" steak. Surprised at how fast this took, I took a look at the steak. From first glance, it was quite obvious that the steak had been sitting under a heating lamp for a long time. The steak was very dry with no juice when a fork was pressed into it. The fat on the trim of the steak looked like rubber, yellow with no moisture. At this point I sent it back and did not bother to order anything else not trusting them to get the order right. Until we left, we never received an apology from the manager or server.",

Yuck. No wonder why it was kind of cheap. 3 Course meal (appetizer, entree, dessert) for only $10! Of course, who wouldn't want to choose that?! But anyway... our first visit will probably be our last. Sad, because I heard they have the best steak and eggs in town.  I ordered a house salad (because, you can't go wrong with a house salad), pasta with chicken, and a scoop of CHOCOLATE ice cream for dessert.  While we were sitting and waiting FOREVER for our food, I looked up the reviews on yelp and I was surprised as to why someplace so nice would have such bad ratings. And then, it happened. What I read became reality. Service was super slow. Our server took forever to bring us food or refill drinks. All the servers would do behind us was talk and talk, we could hear their conversations. And get this, it was DEAD! Maybe like 3 tables. And the table that was next to us got their food and everything way before we did! #frustrating   Finally our food came out, one after the other, but in really long intervals.  Salad- tasted like old lettuce... and the dressing taste (vinaigrette) was off. Pasta with chicken- chicken was hard, pasta... harder, and no taste at all. It said it was alfredo, but it wasn't alfredo at all... weird taste.. I tried to at a little bit of salt. It helped a little but the only reason why I kept eating the stuff was because I was hungry. Ice cream- we asked our desserts to-go because they were taking FOREVER and we had a wedding to get ready for... she came back with a to-go cup of ice cream... but it was vanilla.  My sister ordered a mimosa, but it tasted weird.  My sister ordered a Caesar salad (because, you can't ever go wrong with caesar salad), chicken and biscuits, and a brownie.  Caesar salad- once again, dry/old salad, and weird tasting Caesar. Chicken and biscuits- she said it was nothing special. Biscuits were hidden... weird. Brownie- looked stale and hard. Not sure how it tasted though cause she didn't end up eating it lol.  Needless to say, the food was just bleh and boring. Nothing grand about this place at all.",

It is a cafe like most others, they have a decent variety to choose from like most other cafe's and they are not bad but it is also nothing spectacular which does not make this a bad place so please do not get me wrong.  We enjoyed our time here, the staff was very attentive to our needs for food and drink and even helped with taking a few family pictures for us when we were done.  This is a good place to eat if you are looking for a meal with a decent price.  I would come here again if in the area and looking for a place to eat.  I would recommend this place but like I said it is like any other cafe you will find in town especially at a casino.",

It was one of the worst pieces of meat I've ever tasted. Totally dry, zero flavor. It was not seasoned or marinated. I ate a quarter of it just trying to satisfy my hunger, but just could not eat any more.   The server was very accommodating and removed the charge from our bill. But it's more depressing to have flavorless food. Its not about the money. It's the lack of flavor when your excited for steak.   Will definitely skip this place next time we're at Red Rock.",

    "text": "if you patronize the Station Casinos as much as we have, you know that virtually every one of them has a Grand Cafe location.  Because we live in Summerlin, our favorite go-to is the one at Red Rock Hotel and Casino, although the one at Palace Station is a pretty close tie.   I can think of very few places where if you're in the mood for breakfast, and your other half/date/companion wants lunch or dinner, you can both have what you want at the same time. And at ANY time of day or night.  It might take a little extra waiting, but for the most part, thanks to the quality and the QUANTITY, it's usually worth it.  Take our most recent visit (July 6th). I hadn't been awake all that long, although it was about 3 in the afternoon.  We'd been running errands, and I hadn't eaten yet and was RAVENOUS.  I wanted something \"breakfast-y\", while Bear was more in the mood for dinner food. So I had a DIY omelette and French Toast with sausage patties on the side, while he opted for the lasagna. Usually with like items (everyone having the same kind of food), the wait can be about 15-20 minutes while you sip coffee and/or other drinks.  The waitress was very apologetic when we were headed for the thirty minute mark, and she explained that she was waiting on the lasagna.  We weren't in any particular hurry, so for us, it was no big deal.   When the food finally came, it was all warm and fresh and as we hoped for, worth the wait. So if you're doing a show or a movie beforehand and you choose the Cafe, I would suggest budgeting your time wisely and accordingly, if you know what your show time is, and you want to be there promptly.  Otherwise, I'd say save your Grand Cafe visit until AFTER the event, or when you aren't in a huge hurry to get somewhere.   Oh, and as others have already pointed out, their bakery case is REDONKULOUS.  I'm glad we skirted around it on the way out - otherwise, we would've ended up taking something home. (Maybe next time.)",

We were seated quite fast ( my fiance is a President member) yet we waited at least 30 min for any service for drinks. Our waitress was not even remotely in our area for 30 min. We tried to get the attention of our waitress but she motioned from afar three times ' be right with you' but made us wait longer while she chatted with the bar person. The food we waited for a further 30 min and my fiance was running late for his appointment with his family and had to leave. One hour in total .. no food. The El Salvadoran born bus waiter was very kind though as he made sure that we were ok for drinks (after they eventually came).  Our waitress came up and tried to tell me management is responsible for the kitchen delays. Yet in my experience in hospitality the waitress should be hustling the cooks to hurry. To top off everything our waitress haphazardly handed me a piece of paper (the bill) without a pen to even sign the bill with.  I understand restaurants have bad days but I hope for them this isn't the standard way of running their business.  Everyone there waited for ages for their food., not just us. The place felt chaotic and they really need to get their act together especially being a part of a great hotel. Grand Cafe does the Red Rock Casino no service.",

Several staff members saw us waiting and didn't even bother to acknowledge us, much less let us know someone would be with us a shortly. After almost 15 minutes, and a line forming behind us of confused and impatient patrons. The hostess showed up, but not before stopping to chat with a co-worker right I front of us.  This woman was a miserable, grumpy old lady who promptly screeched out a rude, \"how many?\", But before we could answer she started scolding us about where we were standing, demanding, \"you need to MOVE.\" Extremely rude. We had no where to move as there was a swarm of people behind us.  I told her that there was no one standing at the hostess stand so we weren't sure where to stand to wait, she glares at me, and gets uncomfortably close before screeching at me, all while I'm holding my toddler, \" I REALLY NEED YOU TO MOVE.\" We decide at that moment that enough is enough and we turn to leave.  I muttered under my breath about how rude she was and she decides to then FOLLOW us out of the restaurant yelling, \"what did you say to me?\" \"Do you want to start something?!\"  Seriously folks, all while I'm holding a toddler.  We complained to the clueless manager, who apologized but, of course she did, what else can you do?  As you can tell from the other reviews, this is typical, and management doesn't care.  We will never be back.",

    "text": "I came here twice for breakfast during our stay at Red Rock. The first time wasn't so great, but the second time was a bit better so I rounded out this review to three stars in total.   The first time we came here my family and I all met for breakfast. Fueling up for a day of gambling and fun. I wasn't really feeling breakfast. I'm not a breakfast person to begin with, but I thought it would be a good idea to eat something to help me get through the day. I spit the eggs Benedict with my Aunt. We also played five games of keno here, but unfortunately none of us won anything. We didn't have to wait long for breakfast and everything came at the same time. Everything on my plate was under seasoned and my hash browns turned out greasy and soggy. I still ate my breakfast though, but soon after I felt a bit sick to my stomach. Not a good breakfast. I was dreading coming back here tomorrow because I knew my family would want to.   The next day we came back for breakfast. I didn't sleep well the night before and I had a headache. I was having trouble adjusting to the altitude change, my oxygen is low to start with so even going up a couple thousand feet messes me up. I did not order any breakfast because I didn't want to be disappointed. I just ordered a virgin Bloody Mary to help with my headache and wake me up. There was some confusion with ordering my drink though. Our server, or at least I thought he was my server told me to order my Bloody Mary through another person, but that person didn't come to our table. So everyone got their drinks, but me. It might of been because my drink had to be ordered through the bar and the first server didn't take bar orders which was kinda stupid. Once all of my family arrived for breakfast the person who I was supposed to put my drink order through finally came to take all of our orders. After waiting another few minutes I got my drink and I was happy. It was pretty thick and spicy, very substantial, just what I wanted.   I had planned not to eat anything, but when the food came I changed my mind. My Aunt who I had split breakfast with the day before got her hash browns extra crispy this time and they were perfect. Make a note, if you order hash browns here get them extra crispy, otherwise they will be soggy and give you a stomach ache. I also got a couple pieces of bacon from here which were good too. My parents split the goat cheese, spinach and mushroom omelette, and a took a little piece of that. The goat cheese made that omelette. My Dad also thought he had ordered extra crispy hash browns and I heard him order it, but I guess the waitress forgot and gave him the yucky soggy ones.   We played keno one last time. The keno guy recognized us and got us situated with our games right away. My Parents tipped him a $5 before the game even started, they said their last trip here they tipped the keno person before the game and they won, so they decided to try that out again. After watching and losing all my games last time, I tried a different tactic. I remember seeing a few numbers that got played quite often during the games so I played a couple of those along with some of my favorite numbers. I ended up winning around $30 this time. I guess it helps to tip the keno guy and to study the numbers. I was the big winner at my table. I think I understand why my family always likes to have breakfast here now.",

I foresee many more visits to this spot due to its convenient location (from my work) and delicious food.",

Wasn't quite sure why it was so slow as we ate around 10 pm and there were maybe a handful of customers besides us.   They do have a very delectable looking dessert counter with an various desserts behind the glass, but I managed to refrain from getting any. Not as tempting as the slot machines and table games :)",

    "text": "Here's the low-down:   They are definitely a must at Texas Station if you're a night-owl and love steak and hamburgers! They serve breakfast all day, every day.  Their pastries are reasonably priced, tasty and they are rather large for the money.  Aside from these things, you're better off going to Denny's, iHop or the Feast Buffet only a few feet past the Starbucks farther into the casino area.  I say this because the portions are plenty for whatever food you get - as it fills your plate! - but the breakfast I received was anything by great.    It didn't take two long for my boyfriend and I to get a table.  The blonde hostess was polite but definitely not very up-beat or \"smile-y\".  Being an ex-hostess myself, I realize how important it is to be very happy, enthusiastic and charismatic - it really sets the mood more than you would think. Nevertheless, I didn't feel very welcome and again, it was just \"blah\".  This cafe is not big at all from what I could see at the time of the day we arrived!  It's no wonder other Yelpers complain about the wait, the place is actually pretty small.  It's a little disorienting because I believe they block off half of the restaurant early in the day for some odd reason or another - I can only assume they open the place up for dinner and \"nightlight\" dining.     Anyway, on to the good bits, we got Mercedes who is by far the best waitress in the entire restaurant!  She was very sweet and she took the initiative to strike up a small conversation between us ordering, us waiting for food and once we actual began to eat.  It was a kind gesture and it made our experience better - we definitely felt more comfortable than initially waiting for a table, if you know what I mean.    I ended up ordering coffee and orange juice for the drinks, the boyfriend just getting a water.  I went for the three egg veggie omelette with green bell pepper, mushrooms and spinach.  It comes with hash browns which is nice and for some reason it comes with a plethora of toast? I had FOUR slices on my plate.  Mercedes asked me if I wanted cheese on my omelette and I of course nodded, assuming she wanted my preference of cheese so I told her.  Little did I know, they charged us for it!  It was about two extra dollars added to the bill that was completely unnecessary. On top of it all, I also got a side of bacon - this was a terrible idea.  I asked how much it would be and Mercedes told me it would be $3.49.  That's right, almost $4 for FOUR slices of bacon!  Once I ordered it, I ate once slice but then crumbled the rest on my omelette.  In doing so by coincidence, Mercedes comes to the table a little later, saying that if she knew I wanted to do that, she could have added bacon to the omelette for only $.99!  Really, people?!  I feel like my wallet was violated for no apparent reason whatsoever.  Don't they already get enough of my wallet when I use the blasted Slot machines?    The boyfriend ended up getting the breakfast bowl.  It came with scrambled eggs, hash browns, white gravy and a small biscuit on top.  My omelette was beautifully made, but completely and totally tasteless and bland.  I had to put more than four shakes of salt on it with pepper AND Tabasco sauce for it to even taste semi-desirable.  The boyfriend's meal was \"okay\" as he put it.  I didn't try a bite but taking a small taste of the biscuit, it was dry.  Apparently the gravy they used gave his eggs and hash browns a taste but that is more than likely the case because of the sodium content in it.  This is actually the reason why I'm giving Grand Cafe a two out of five stars - the breakfast food is so iffy, you may or may not even get something tasty!      Remember how I said I got an orange juice and coffee?  I mentioned that for a reason.  Because BOTH of these things cost us an extra $3.00 EACH.  Yes, you heard that right.  A three dollar cup of Joe. Bottom line here: always ask the waitress how much extras and sides cost and DO NOT expect a cheap meal here.  The family next to us in a booth ordered hamburgers and apparently, as I heard them tell their waitress, was phenomenal.  Too bad we didn't get a slice of that cloud 9 they were on because when we looked at how much we owed after all was said and done, we were very disgruntled.  Mercedes was a great waitress which is why I'm giving this Cafe TWO STARS instead of one.    Visitors and hotel guests of Texas Station, go elsewhere for food!",

The second time I went to this cafe, the service we received was a lot slower.  I could tell that the waiter we had was waiting on too many tables.  He did make an effort to bring us what we requested for as soon as he could.  The third time I went to this cafe was the worst experience ever.  The wait time to get seated was not bad; it was pretty fast.  It was the wait time for a waitress or waiter to get to us, that was horrible.  It took 10 minutes of waiting at our booth to order our drinks, and another 10 minutes to get our drinks.  After our drinks got delivered, the waitress just left our table.  After waiting for another 15 minutes and not getting service, we got up to talk to the person at the register to get our bill for the two beverages (coke and hot chocolate) we ordered.  (The hot chocolate had no taste and no one came back for me to tell them.)  She did tell us that we didn't have to pay for the beverages, but how she responded to us, was like it happens often.   All the things we ordered here: artichoke and spinach dip (good), chowder (good), fried zucchini (great), club sandwich (tastes like a club from anywhere else, nothing spectacular), bbq bacon cheeseburger (good, huge portion), turkey dinner (good, huge portion), coke, hot chocolate (horrible, tasted like water that looked like hot chocolate).",

Don't be fooled by the $9.99 three course meal deal signs that show crab legs. The best you can do for $9.99 is spaghetti and meatballs.  The small portion of prime rib will cost you about $15.  They aren't offering any cheap Vegas specials, like you would expect from a casino - so I don't see why they can't seat and serve people in a reasonable amount of time.

We ended up here after not wanting to wait an hr and a half for pf changs or bjs and took an easier(quicker) option  Maybe the 3rd time ive been here? I still remember their gigantic bigger-than-the-plate hamsteak. But today i had a sore throat and chose the half sandwich and soup. Plain turkey on white... very uninspired i know its just a deli sandwich but any kind of house sauce or, anything would have been nice. But at least the turkey was piled up, the lettuce wasnt wilted and the tomato was fresh cut (it seemed) no fries so i dont know why they still plate it on a large... maybe put the soup bowl on there too or something, looked bad is all  I didnt expect a great chicken noodle soup since its just a cafe, but the damn thing wasnt even hot, very disappointing. Didnt send it back just ate it first and had to rely on the hot tea to sooth my throat.  Fried zucchini for appetizers were above par, not overcooked or soggy, and had some cheese cooked in which was a nice touch.  Menu was basic cafe, not as long as the rampart cafe, but enough to please our party from my soup/sandwich, to my sisters ny steak, dads meatloaf, moms chicken and girlfriends omelet. Dad also liked that they had a Gordon Beirsch marzen available from the bar.  7-12 per plate, excusing the 18$ ny steak so the bill was only slightly higher than expected, 4$ beer, free water, no bread  Overall its acceptable for an easy quick meal while at red rock, but only if everything else is closed, youre on a budget, or dont like the food court. Given a choice though i prefer the Rampart Cafe, buffets are another story :P",

    "text": "I don't why there are so many bad reviews of the Grand Cafe. Went there on a comped stay at Red Rock and had some fantastic food for both dinner and breakfast. For dinner try the prime rib. It was a huge portion and was sooo good. For breakfast I had a New Mexico omelette with avocado. It was amazing.Both of our servers were super nice ladies who loved our daugheter.  I am postulating that most of these bad reviews come from people who are pissed after losing at the casino and take their bad attitude to the restaurant.",

    "text": "Been here a few times after we hit the movies. Food is ok. Like their breakfast. Some tasty pancake and waffle toppings. Stopped by at 2pm for late lunch. Place almost empty. 40 minute wait for food.... Crab and avocado omelet was dry. Standard breakfast was ok... just ok. Eggs benedict average. Eat outside if you can. Really nice view of the pool area. its all about the view. Prices are about $9 a plate for the breakfast stuff. Thing I love about this place is the dessert area up front. They have the coolest little creations. Lemon meringue pies in the shape of little bee hives with marzipan bees. SO cool. If you don't eat at the cafe at least stop and grab a few treats.",

    "text": "Why do people wait on line to eat at this place?  Is it for the cheap Boarding Pass specials maybe? The food quality has gone way way down over the past year, the portions have shrunk on most items, yet the menu prices have remained the same or higher. Went in the other nite, and orderd the fish and chips and an add on wedge salad.  Salad was a tiny chunk of lettuce, with a few cherry tomato halves, crumbled bacon and dressing. Small and really not worth the extra 2.99.  The fish and chips, was horrible, it was supposed to come with cole slaw, but the waiter insisted that it did not and would be extra (not True) he finally and reluctantly brought it. The fish was over fried frozen fillets. the insides were a dry mess.  Perhaps that is why service is slow, they take extra time to dry outyour food.  Not a good experiance, wont go back.  Stations, wake up and get some decent quality food on your menus!!",

    "text": "We came here after watching Steve Wyrick's Magic Show on the advice of my mother who plays poker here.   At 11 pm - the food was mediocre. My turkey club sandwich had processed luncheon meat. Big no-no!  I choose from the $9.99 + menu: Caesar's Salad - good Club Sandwich & fries - huge but disappointing Chocolate Cake - my slice was literally gone in 3 slices of my fork  The rest of my party had NY steaks which they complained were chewy and rather rare inside. (yet they ate them!)  Best thing about this place was the fries and my bubbly waitress. First thing she says is \"your water is city water, it's thick and hard... it ain't good!\"",

    "text": "Went there on a Saturday morning with the family.  Service, especially the person who greeted us at the table and took our drink order was fantastic.  Dude was so happy to see each and every customer it was unreal.  We order a scrambled bowl, pancakes platter and an item off the \"Spa\" menu (more healthy options).  My husband thought the spa meal was great, and the little guy loved the pancakes.  Service was good overall and our meal came surprisingly fast, just in time for a squirming 3 year old.   I would say, for being off the strip and inside a casino, the prices were a tad high for breakfast.  I would guess they would have specials during the week, but they were no where to be found on Saturday.  I'd go back for sure.",

    "text": "The Red Rock is a nice casino but honestly I expencted better from this restaurant.  It was decent especially for the pirce ($9.99 3 course meals) but i think i would have rather spent my $10 elsewhere.  Nothing fancy about it. I ordered the philly cheeseteak and the gf went for the prime rib end cut.  The cheesesteak wasnt anything crazy. just the same ol run of the mill cheesesteak. The meat was quite tender though.  The prime rib was pretty good as well  esp. for $15.   The place isn't bad but nothing special at the same time.  Great service from the server to the bus boy though.  I kinda wish i went to a different more intersting spot to eat next time.",

So we wait and wait and wait some more just like everyone else for clearly no good reason. About 15 mins for drinks food didn't take that long to get but upon tasting my food I new why. I think my hamburger patty and fries were reheated and old all our food extreamly overpriced very bland well just gross. My daughter loved her bowl of mac n cheese which made me happy because she never realized  her deep fried mac n cheese bites she ordered never came. Victoria our server was alright but the hostess krisstina needs to severely get over herself and maybe not b!tch at the servers in front of customers while we're finally getting served also sorry krisstina that we weren't good enough to ring out either but thanks for taking the people behind us and for walking away to leave us waiting after you were done! This place sucks! Typical Vegas...",

I ordered a hamburger cooked to medium to go and it was well done - very well done. The fries were just ok which was unfortunate. It was an \"OK\" meal but not great. I'd only go back because there aren't a lot of options at this location but I wouldn't go back if I had more options.",
