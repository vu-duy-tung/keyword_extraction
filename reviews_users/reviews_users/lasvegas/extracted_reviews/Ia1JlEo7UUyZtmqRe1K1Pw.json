We got here and it was packed so we opted to sit outside which is a cute little patio with a few tables and a view of some shops. We were greeted immediately and I ordered an iced chai latte. I am a huge critic of chai lattes and this drink here made it to my top 5, it's amazing! There is so much to chose from on the menu to eat. I love that it has a latin twist to their food. I had ordered the bagel with bacon and eggs with has browns. It was simple and I enjoyed it. The service was prompt and they were friendly. We will back back to try other menu items .",

The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is there was a wait for tables, yet 4 tables had been vacated but there was no buser to clean said tables.  The hostess at the front appeared to be bored.  Once we were seated on the patio we had a lovely brunch.  I forgot our servers name but she had a cute personality and was helpful with suggestions.",

    "text": "\"Meh\" is too generous.  Tried yesterday with family and hit the place at about 10AM.  Initial impression was this place was being operated by young, snobby millennials who care more about the crap they are playing over the sound system than their customers.  Took several requests to serve my daughter's juice and more to get my other daughter's side of potatoes. When I asked where they were, no apology, just \"order is on the way\".  Chef/Cooks can't handle the menu, which is far too complex to be run by amateurs. My benedict had one hard yolk (not run whatsoever) and one that was also over, but not hard.  Bacon was served raw and was addressed by manager as \"here is your 'crispy' bacon\".  No, sir, you served me RAW PORK.  Potatoes finally arrive and they are under cooked.  Shocker.   2 stars because my food was good, but nobody else cared for theirs.  Will not be returning.  Far too many options in the area that are superior in service, atmosphere and value.",

The other location is located somewhere in the arts district.  I even heard some people call it a \"hidden gem\"  So when I found out they were opening a new location at Downtown Summerlin I just couldn't wait!  Seated right away, I noticed the interior was very clean which is a must for me.  Being a barista, strong coffee is always preferred so when I tried their expresso I fell in love right away.  Will be back, probably with shopping bags in my hand hehe",

Our legs were constantly touching each other. Our pregnant mom was forced to sit in the sun on mother's day We asked for a different table and our server didn't even ask to see if we could have the table.

It seems to be decently packed throughout the week but especially busy during the weekends because people find it to be a nice brunch place. As I mentioned in my review of their original location, it's Latin inspired breakfast-lunch items, however, many of the dishes that I have gotten at this location have been underwhelming sometimes in flavor, other times in presentation. The coffee is ok, the specialty lattes can be overly sweet and lacks the True coffee flavor that should be prominent, also it's on the expensive side ($5 and up). Service is always slow and leaves you wondering whether they forgot about you. Unfortunately I must say, go to the other location that's downtown...you'll be way more satisfied.",

What I pictured in my head was a hipster coffee bar and I wasn't wrong.   I'm personally attracted to the wool knitted hat, beards, round glasses kind of scene and this place was full of it. We enter and stand awkwardly waiting to be seated. After a couple minutes a nice girl seats us.   She gives us menus with an extensive choice of coffees and brunch options. I ordered a sea salt caramel latte and my friend ordered a honey almond latte. The drinks upon arrival looked amazing. When I first sipped it I was amazed with the taste and my friends drink was tasty as well. I only managed to get through about half of my latte, the salt content eventually became too much and I couldn't continue with it.   Very trendy place with awesome atmosphere. The menu is extensive enough for you to find something you'll like. For the same price as Starbucks with a trendier vibe why not give it a try.",

However, every host we dealt with was incredulous and snappy, acting like we were less than them.

Same great menu and drinks as the arts district location.  If you've been to the original, just trade the hipsters for the Summerlin set.  Now... I'm willing to give this place the benefit of doubt since it recently opened and maybe they haven't hit their stride... but the experience was not nearly as good as at their phenomenal original location.   Went on a Sunday afternoon and the place  was bursting at the seams... the service was completely overwhelmed.  The service was slow, confused and the food quality was not the best.    I'll give them another try ... maybe in a few weeks.  Hopefully they will have gotten their groove and be as good as their original location.  Till then...",

I've been to plenty of coffee shops and brunch places in NY/SF and this is probably one of the most expensive places I've ever been to. With tax and tip, my drink alone came out to be around $8.  2) My drink was horrible, and the food was just alright. I ordered an iced matcha green tea latte, and it was literally just milk, ice, and the tiniest bit of matcha. It was the worst drink I've ever had in my life, and it was so expensive.  3) The food was just okay - nothing really horrible but also nothing really great, either. Would not recommend to anyone.",

Instead someone had to step in and put us down. Very long wait time for our food & check. Even asked someone if they can bring out a sauce, it never came. Nonetheless, our order was good.. just wish it was more organized & timely. This location is bigger in size & my go-to lavender infused coffee never disappoints!

Both locations sever consistent food and give off equivalent vibes, in which it's a trendy spot to meet up with some friends and even work on some stuff through your laptop.  I am a fan of their coffee, as it isn't as bland as Starbucks and the croissant I ordered was pretty good. It's hard to mess up a croissant unless you're Coffee Bean, where I had a bad experience with a cold (!?) croissant!",

But, the three star review comes from the poor service this location provides. There needs to be some service standards training done wit this group. Make sure when you order your drinks you are ready to order everything due to the fact you most likely won't see your server for another fifteen to twenty minutes. This review does not stem from one visit, but multiple with the same result. They do have bottomless mimosas, but good luck getting more than two in an hour span of being there. Also, their mimosa portion size is teeny tiny, so try and order a couple if you can cause you'll be parched for quite some time. Getting a refill will also take a solid twenty minutes to make it to your table just a heads up. Once your food is dropped make sure you ask for everything you need including your check because you will also be waiting for close to half an hour to forty minutes for someone to check up on your table. Even had the same experience when we had management serving us, so dear owner, please help this location",

This place is not a cheap cuppa coffee or breakfast foods, but it is well worth it. The coffee and food are excellent the staff is courteous and efficient. One of the huge wins of this place is the Decour they have a whole myriad of seating styles and environmental a statics that just pop and so many unique ways. They have an adult garden swing inside... A garden swing! They have multiple nooks and crannies for people to post up and enjoy their cup of Joe or an extraordinarily well crafted signature beverage. Be forewarned however, this place gets slammed in the wait times are not kind to the soles of your feet. Also seating is not standardized Due to all the little nooks and crannies so if you have a party of two or more you need to make sure you find a place, post up and then send your comrade to go get your food :-). I will definitely be going back there... With the help of my trusty Geo pin!",

Walked in had two people waiting in front of us no biggie just waited and waited about 20 minutes later I got fed up and went up to the to go counter and asked is anyone going to seat us we all have been waiting for 20 minutes and no one even came up to us just ignored us. So then the gentleman said he would get someone right away but right away ended up being 15 minutes later the family in front of us walked out very upset and I felt horrible for them cause as soon as they left then someone came to seat us. Now I'm irritated and unhappy for the wait they then sat us next to this huge table with 10 loud costumers so rude! and the music they had was so loud I couldn't even enjoy my food.  The only thing I enjoyed was my coffee which by the way had been sitting on the counter for 20 minutes while we received our food before our coffee yikes!",

We had the bandeja which is I believe a Colombian dish served with steak, rice and beans , avocado, fried egg and plantains it was delicious. We also ordered the Empanadas and the arepa with chicken which was absolutely delicious. The owners Josh and Omar are brothers and one of their managers Joye were so friendly making us feel so welcome . I will definitely be going back . Btw did I mention their coffee was great ! Try the Bon Bon  if you like your coffee sweet !",

    "text": "Maybe my visit just wasn't the right time for me to visit. Came here on a Sunday just before 11am and decided to stop in as I waited for the shops to open up. It was a nice day out so I requested a table outside. There was one available but it needed to be cleaned off so I agreed to wait. As it was being cleaned off and the dishes were being taken to the back another couple comes in behind me. A gentleman (I'm assuming the manager) asked me if I'd been helped and I told him yes so he assisted the couple behind me. He takes them to a table in the back then they ask to sit outside. He then takes them to the table outside that I was waiting for to be cleaned off. The lady who was cleaning the table off then walks me to the door outside and then sees the couple being sat there and just says \"ohh sorry can I sit you here??\" I said fine and sat at the tall long table. I'm watching the food come out and the coffees being made and see a cinnamon roll that looked delicious. So I asked to order it I'm then informed they're all out...great yet another strike. I just ordered a coffee which was okay. Then I'm trying to enjoy my time and then someone gets sat right in front of me at this long table, there were plenty of other seats. So now I'm staring directly at this guy I have no idea who is...awkward. Probably won't be back",

We went to the to go line to get a coffee and they told us they were not allowed to serve us a to go coffee because our name was on the waiting list to dine in. I explained that we only wanted a coffee and the lady was very snappy and said she couldn't. There was no room in the restaurant to wait so we casually waited next to the serving bar and another server came up and yelled at us because we were in the way.  We kindly explained we were trying to get out of the way for him and his staff. At this point, we decided to leave and asked the hostess if she could remove our name because we felt like some of the service was not kind. The hostess didn't even look up. She said, \"Oh, really? Okay.\" I have never seen a more unprofessional group.",

The other empanadas were also really good but I think my favorite was the beef with chimichurri, sooooo good!  I'm not much of a coffee guy and whenever I do drink coffee it's with friends and I always get what I consider to be \"fufu\" drinks. I definitely don't take my coffee black! That being said, I had their lavender latte and it tasted really good! I think the lavender gives it something the big coffee shops don't seem to have.  The first time we went service was a little slow. But it was day one of opening and really busy so I can understand. The second visit was around New Years, the service was pleasant and quick.",

    "text": "So we first fell in love with the downtown location of Makers.The food and coffee were always consistently good. So when the Downtown Summerlin M&F opened we were over the moon to have a location closer to us. The first couple of times we went we were very pleased with the food,coffee and service. These last 3 times we have come unfortunately have been majorly disappointing. We order the same 2 drinks every time and they have tasted different every.single.time. On top of the fact that the taste of the drinks are inconsistent (which is odd to me, shouldn't the baristas be taught a standard way to make each drink?) the waiter has either forgotten to add a shot of espresso in our chai tea latte, forgotten to make it a large (but charged us for a large on the bill) or just given us a wrong drink all together. And I could go on about a couple of other inconsistencies with the food as well but I'm quite honestly tired of typing. We have come at least 4 times in the last 2 weeks alone but this will no longer be our go to breakfast spot. My advice to the owners if you read this is to better train your staff and cooks. With all that being said,I do believe you have a great spot with quality food and a special concept! But your employees lack of training in preparation of said food/drinks or lack of caring in general maybe, will likely have other regulars finding another spot to dine as well. No one wants to roll the dice every time they step through your doors.",

Never have I had a manager or shift leader tell me ah yeah yeah you will be fine, after complaining to her because we waited one hour for our food. Her response was yeah yeah you be fine. Wow just shocking I have been here many time on busy occasions and never took that long or had a bad experience but this did it I will not be disrespected specially paying between 60-80 dollars a visit for service like the way she gave me I rather go to McDonald's dollar menu and get that service and pay three forth of the money. To add seems like she had a groups of friends that where there she was too busy attending to her friends than any of the paying customers that where at the restaurant. I ask my self what kind of owner allows this kind of behavior ? But more and more I read review seems like the owner doesn't improve this issues. All I can say please be wise of where you spend your hard earned money and precious time now a days there's so much competition that you can choose anywhere but the quality and service is priceless just a hint that can be useful.

Inside: the inside decor is cute and so chic! Almost reminds me of a BOHO coffee shop I once went to in Portland. I was just a bit confused at first because in regular coffee shops, you go up to the counter and pay for your drink then that's it. But this is an actual sit down type of cafe.  Drinks: so the lavender latte came highly recommended by our wonderful server. Also, because we wanted to get a coffee art for the pictures (haha!) but the taste did not disappoint. And I usually drink coffee but man! For some reason, their coffee made me feel so awake. Which is a good thing if you're trying to stay up to study.  Food: food wise, & this is where the one down star came from..  I thought it was pretty mediocre. We got the nachos on happy hour.  Service was great! Ambiance is welcoming & coffee was delicious.",

The open patio and charming lobby makes this place an excellent place for photo opt for IG and Yelpers. The main draw is their delicious coffee drinks with the Lavender Latte being among the most talked about drink. I personally like their Vanilla Honey Latte. A perfect combination of a smooth coffee taste and sweetness. The honey compliments the vanilla flavor giving you a balanced latte that is relaxing and satisfying.  I haven't had much of their food items, however they make a delicious Empanada platter and Caesar salad from my previous experience at their original location a few years ago. I would come back to enjoy more items from their Latin influenced menu.  2018 Yelp Review #25",

I used to go to their downtown location and I was quite excited when I heard they were opening up a new one here in DTS.  I really love their coffee beverages. Really unique combination of flavors.   They really need to improve on their *quality* of food. I was feeling basic and ordered an avocado toast. Their bread wasn't even toasted and it was just 4.5 slivers of avocado and they used a third-rate salsa to top it off. Extremely disappointing.  I'll definitely come back for their beverages and for some more Instagram photos.",

I ordered the empanada platter (carne and chicken), which also comes with black beans, rice and a small side salad. Omg. Whatever is in the sauces atop each of these empanadas is HEAVEN!!!!   I am also a huge coffee person. Like give me a drip line of that stuff and I'll be one happy lady! My lavender latte was amazing. My friend and I joked about how my design looked like a sad pumpkin while she had a super cute heart on hers. But, pumpkin or not... every last sip was full of flavor and worth the $6! I especially loved that there was real lavender sprinkled over the latte.  I was also lucky enough to be able to try some of my friends chilaquiles (I may have puppy eyed her to snag some)... and now I don't know what I will order next time I visit! Everything was just THAT good.  Bonus- my work is within walking distance... so if I want some yummy food every day, I can happily make my way to M&F!",

Our server was very nice but it was even better that every employee walking by checked on us. Though, the real star here is the menu! It's actually why we came in. When looking for a brunch spot, my boyfriend noticed all the gluten free options. I'm GF so we knew this was a must! We had the egg white omelet with smoked salmon, the arepa short rib benny, and the veggie benny. The gluten free corn cakes for the Benedicts are delicious!! The short rib was perfectly seasoned, veggies and their hollandaise was excellent, and the omelet was far better than typical boring egg whites. We also had lavender and hibiscus mimosas. They were great too!! We'll definitely be back for another benny day and to try the lattes!",

I really love the modern decor and their outside seating but that was unavailable. I was seated at their bar top since I was a party of one and it was a little cramped when they sat people next to me.    I've had their coffee before and it is pretty good but overpriced $4.50-6 per drink item.   I really want to love this place but when it comes down to it- I could make this food at home and the portions are small for the price. I ordered the Avocado salad $9 and added chicken $3 which sounded like avocado and corn would be the highlight of the salad, but really, it was a ton of barely dressed greens and some corn hidden in there. If I hadn't added chicken, I would've been sorely disappointed. Even with the chicken, I left somewhat hungry and disappointed I made the effort to go out to lunch.",

The Lomo Saltado was awesome.  \"I really just want a cup of coffee.\" - That's really how this adventure to Makers & Finders started to the heart of Downtown Summerlin. Their coffee are as many as their food choices and the atmosphere is very relaxed.   I ended up getting a Sea Salt Caramel Latte & the Lomo Saltado. The latte was your usual affair, but probably made much better since outside was pretty cold and I wanted something warm. The Lomo Saltado was great; it's a testament to food when your table-mates keep taking food off your plate.  Overall, solid place to visit and meet-up with some people you haven't seen in awhile and just want to sit around and chat with a nice cup of coffee and a bite to eat.",

I'm hoping that my honest review will help give this new location the push they need to strive to be better.   ORDERED: 4/5 - Honey Vanilla Latte (coconut milk since I'm Vegan AF): Delicious beverage but unfortunately it came out barely warm, and a warm latte well... that's just no fun.   3/5 - Vegan Empanada Sampler: Yay for vegan bites, mehh for the taste of these little guys. Lacked flavor and again these weren't nice and toasty like I expected.   4/5 - Warm Coconut Vegan Soup: Flavorful, semi-thick creamy soup which would have received a 5/5 but I had to send it back because it was cold just like everything else.   1/5 - Vegetarian Burger (minus cheese): I highly advise everyone NOT to order this frozen, Morning Star burger. When I asked the waiter about it he even said, \"Well honestly nobody has ever ordered that\" and now I know why. I appreciate them trying to add a vegan/vegetarian burger option on the menu but this tasted exactly like the frozen, off-brand plant-based burger from the grocery store, which is not ok when you're spending good money for a restaurant quality dish.   PROS: + Cute location in downtown Summerlin + Even though our server wasn't great, the owners did act very professionally when trying to assist us which was much appreciated + Unique, tasty lattes (try the lavender latte w/ coconut milk)  CONS: - Packed for Sunday brunch. Expect to wait for a table - Server seemed to be having a bad day or was irritated with us maybe? Either way, it was clear and it didn't make us want to return.  - All of our food/drinks came out either luke warm or cold  I really wanted to love this place and I'm disappointed that our Sunday Funday didn't include a fantastic dining experience. One day I'd like to return and have a completely different experience. Come on, I'm rooting for ya M&F!",

    "text": "Decided to try this place after a coworker recommended. I called ahead because it was Independence Day and wanted to make sure they were open. Score they were but only until 3p! My family and I arrive, unfortunately there was a sign that stated they were closed for a private event, it was noon. Insert scooby doo sad face!! The woman who picked up the call never mentioned closing for a private event when I called! Luckily I still decided to go inside and a gentleman who looked like the manager greeted me. I asked about the sign, he did confirm there was a \"private event\". I asked if he could make the exception since we live on the other side of town...literally 25 min away. He looked around and said sure but asked me to wait as there were some ppl ahead of us waiting to be seated...hmmm private event? People waiting to be seated? At that moment my husband whispered to me that there was no event, they just wanted to get out on time for the holiday. I quickly became super observant out of curiosity...and sure enough my husbands assumption was correct. That really set the tone of disappointment. Why lie to customers for your own personal agenda? Your hours are typically until 5p...if you wanted to close earlier then close earlier! No need to place a bogus sign out front to discourage patrons. Anyway, off of my soap box! Fast forward to ordering amd food. Despite having a small crowd (due to the sign) service was slow to get our orders. But once they took them the food came out pretry quickly. I ordered the breakfast empanadas. It was tasty but i yearned for more filling. For $3.50 each I would have hoped for just a bit more filling. My husband ordered the burger, super tasty. I also ordered the Lavender Latte meh nothing to write home about, it was good but I wished it had a bit more flavor...could juat be the coffee brand they use. The ambiance is cool, pricing is a bit up there for breakfast but it is Downtown Summerlin. Rents are high I get it.  I would say come once to try it out, you be the judge. As for me, I think I will try the downtown location versus coming back here. Again, the deceitful sign to discourage patrons from enterting the establishment on the holiday really turned me off. But after dragging my husband down we had to finish what we started. We came, we saw and conquered...wont return.",

The sandwiches were not remarkable but our big disappointment was the tea. The tea was served in a small jar with lots of ice. It was refreshing on a very hot day but unfortunately they would not refill this drink. We spoke to the server and the manager and they told us firmly that there were no refills. Each small jar was $3.50 each. Very disappointing since most restaurants do refill iced drinks.",

I love the food and the coffee. Their Salted Caramel latte is in fact delicious and it's always a great idea to add lavender syrup into that goodness. As far as the service- I don't understand why these guys are always grumpy and borderline rude. When my family came into town last week, we sat at a table in the back. I had never seen the tea served that way, so I had asked how to drink it. The server said \"Are you kidding me, it's Japanese style. You seriously don't know how to drink it?\". Sure, if I knew what that was, I would probably have gotten it. The whole interaction was rude and the second time I went in, it was the same deal. I'll probably go back just because I work in the mall and the coffee is good, but I don't really expect a pleasant interaction at this point.  UPDATE: I went back in and the service was amazing. Thank you M&F",

Ordered the turkey club that advertises maple bacon strips and choice of crispy fries. I received a turkey sandwich with once piece of very undercooked bacon spilt between each half of the sandwich, minimal slices of turkey, and too much lettuce to make up for the lack of turkey and bacon. Asked for garlic aloi on the side, had to ask a second time and was provided a teaspoon of sauce that barely filled half of the small silver cup. \"Crispy fries\" were neither crispy or hot. They did provide new bacon after I showed them mine was undercooked. Server was nice, after taking our order she checked on us once then a second server checked on us after delivering the food.  No water refills or  condiments offered, and all the silverware was left in the middle of the table- in a pile we each had to dig through to find what we needed. May try again, to see if it was just an off day.",

My boyfriend and I decided to give it a go this morning. We got there and they said it would be about a 10 min wait - totally ok. We saw a few empty tables but didn't complain and just waited until we got seated. Two couples came in after us & got seated right away- totally irritating. After about 15 minutes of waiting and getting annoyed we got seated. It was pretty busy but not busy enough for them to take forever. Kitchen staff seemed pretty quick and on their feet, it almost looked as if the frontline employees (servers, hostess, etc.) didn't know what was going on.   Food finally came out and it was mediocre. The coffee was great. If I go back it'll only be for the coffee & I will take it to go",

If you have been around Las Vegas, specifically Downtown Las Vegas, you would know they offer, hands down, the best coffee in town and their well complimenting food!   The new location's coffee and food are consistent with its original quality, but what's enhanced is the ambiance! It's open, spacious, and upscale; it's definitely a great hangout place. The new location had a soft opening late last month and picked it right up to keep the service on point because its staff are friendly and efficient. I highly recommend this place to everyone in the Summerlin area. You can't go wrong with their food, especially coffee!",

    "text": "Finally! Makers made it to Summerlin! I have been wanting to hit Makers up for a minute now, but for some reason I am never around DTLV. First off I just want to say that Makers knows what hospitality and kindness are especially when it comes to accommodating your circumstances. We had 5 and a child and they made up tables and chairs within a few minutes due to the influx of people on opening night flowing in and out. In the mean time they accommodated us with refreshments as well as a super comfy couch  Now let's get down to the ordering.   Wife got the Hibiscus tea, very good very fresh. I got the Honey Vanilla latte (OHMYGOSH) it was too bomb. I was waiting for a Starbucks feel to hit me, but Makers latte is much more flavorful and bolder, very rich and creamy. It was ridiculous. Def recommend their latte. Next time I'm trying the Salted Caramel.   Appetizers we got the Empanada platter, comes with 3 dips and several kinds of empanadas, and the Latin poutine fries, comes with gravy and a fried egg pretty bomb. I heard their Arepas are authentic and bomb, def getting them next time.  Entrees, my wife got the Bandeja paisa, comes with steak and a huge cut of Chicharon! Super good, and of course I got the Sofrito Burger house favorite, Angus patty with bacon, mozzarella cheese and a fried egg . They're in the perfect spot in DTS for great food, drinks and music. Go check Makers out def coming back regularly since there on the Westside now!!!",

They've only been open a week or two and everything is still pristine. Most of the employees are clearly seasoned in restauranting and handling the holiday busyness with ease and bringing along the one or two newer employees with less experience. The cold brew coffee is fantastic and the matcha latte is above average. Food is on its way but we are next to where it comes up and everything on the menu comes out looking incredible. Really looking forward to when the weather is a little warmer and we can brunch outside. Been waiting all fall for them to open and they delivered on quality of product and service   Update: It's best to think of this as a restaurant that serves coffee and not as a coffee shop. We popped in on a Saturday afternoon and waited so long for our carryout drinks that we might as well have waited for a table. Doesn't take away from the quality of the product but we probably won't 'pop in' anymore.",

In addition to coffee, they offer a breakfast menu as well as a light bite to eat such as avocado toast.  It's a casual coffee house with a touch of modern, artsy vibe. They have charging outlets for your smart phones or iPad at the bar, or table seating to relax and enjoy your food, drink and company!  Their location in Downtown Summerlin is my favorite spot to unwind, relax and kill time while my daughter's iPhone receives some attention at the Apple store across the street, lol!",

She handled all our parties needs with promptness and grace. She was so friendly and was very attentive to our needs. Andrea made sure all of our mimosas, coffees and waters were filled, our tables were cleared and everything was satisfactory.

I ordered the Coconut Turmeric Latte ($5.50) because Turmeric  is so hot right now...just joking. I like Turmeric and I like coconut so I was curious about this concoction . It worked! It was good. The latte has Coconut syrup, cinnamon, espresso and Turmeric. Every time I took a sip it felt like a warm hug! I decided on the  Empanada plate I had the mushroom and the chicken tinga. The chicken tinga was my favorite it's the first time I've tried it and I didn't regret it. It came with rice and beans. I ate the rice because at the time I didn't eat beans at all. I'm starting to try more and more beans so I will definitely be back to give them a try this time!",

Great service even with a full place and people waiting to be seated, If you want some good coffee and great food, and something local and can rip yourself away from Starbucks lol you should try it.    Almost forgot the reason you should go try this place! Espresso flan!!! Amazing and no further explanation needed, order it and you will understand.",

The food is extremely consistent and I am a HUGE fan of their empanadas and aioli fries! I always get a chicken tinga empanada and another one! It's always so good and delicious. This time - I did get a full combo plate and to be honest, I should've saved the $3 because I could live without the beans and rice. Always have to get the fries and my boyfriend was in love with their overnight chia pudding! Even the table next to us was complimenting how beautiful the presentation was! We also did get coffees and I'm a big fan of the lavender iced latte with almond milk! So good.   They still are working out the kinks but they have so many options that I can't wait to try here for my weekend brunches. Btw - great place to brunch! Definitely will be back to enjoy some cocktails!  I'm so glad they moved to DT Summerlin! Definitely will be back in the future! And do yourself a favor - at least get one empanada! They are so good and worth it!",

    "text": "I was happy to see a legit coffee shop enter the downtown Summerlin area- M&F took over and transformed this space, adding their great coffees and an extensive all-day menu of Latin inspired favorites from breakfast through dinner, including vegan options and alcohol.   Some of my favorite drinks and dishes here include the lavender latte with house-made syrup and the turmeric-coconut latte for something different. The breakfast empanadas are tasty and the arepa benedict is a good go-to for a first visit, but I'll need to return for the avocado relleno and sofrito burger. I hear good things about the coconut tres leches waffle if you're into sweeter options.   But this really is more of a cafe than a coffee shop, set up more for dine-in service rather than grab and go. I've tried to pop in here to grab a drink on my way to work and there really isn't a good place to queue up and service has been consistently slow and somewhat disorganized.   TIP: Happy Hour is 4-6PM with discounted food and drinks!",

They cut up my steak into bite size pieces, which I though was a very nice touch. My husband ordered a latte and chilaquiles with eggs. Everything tasted great.   The 4 star rating was because the prices are set too high for what you get. I can understand that their rent is higher in Downtown Summerlin, but the cost versus the product is too high for me to want to come back on my own.",

    "text": "Had a late brunch here with a friend who was very excited to bring me because she enjoyed the food from her last visit here. Ambience was nice, food was good, however service was HORRIBLE which is mainly the reason for my rating.   I had the avocado toast (per Yelp it's one of their popular dishes) and the matcha green tea latte.  The toast was ok, the cherry tomatoes on top were delish. My friend had the chillaquilles and dirty chai which she truly enjoyed. I had a bite and it was very flavorful and savory. I will have to get that next time, IF I decide to come back.   Now the service. Our server ruined everything for us. We were seated by our hostess, barely looked through the menu and our server comes to take our order. Doesn't introduce herself (I think her name is Skyler from looking at our check), asks if we're ready to order which we weren't. She was about to walk away until my friend had asked her if she could order a drink. At this point she appeared irritable. She came back a few minutes later, took our order and that was the last we seen of her til we were done with our food. Didn't ask us how we were doing throughout our meal, or bother asking if we wanted dessert, just returned back with our check when we were done with our meal and that was it. We had to stop 2 other people to ask for condiments. She clearly wasn't busy with other customers which could explain her being MIA since she was sweeping the floor. The other employees we encountered were pleasant and helpful.   This has had to be the worst service I have ever experienced. We walked out feeling like our business wasn't appreciated. Maybe I'll try the other location in DTLV.",

But the couple right in front of me seemed to enjoy their orders since I've heard them complimenting their meals, so I guess it was pretty good.

Staff is really friendly and make it a fun place to be. There's even live music on occasion at M&F!

After 12 of the meals had come out the waitress asks if there was \"anything else that the table needed\"...completely oblivious to the fact that the three people in front of her did not have meals. She then stated that she was going to bring them out. After 40 min she returns to the table with our meals. Mind you, everyone else's plate had been cleared from the table already. After a member of our party asks if our meals could be comped, she was told the receipts have already been \"printed\" &  a discount was never offered. We waited another 15  min for the receipts that had already been \"printed\". When we finally got our checks the gratuity had already been added to a meal that we waited over 40 min for. Between the three of us we spent over $100 dollars and we were compensated with drink vouchers. Brandon said this was all he could do for us. I never intend to use the offer because that would mean I would have to go back. Don't come here with parties or if you're in a rush.",

Even the check didn't come till 15 minutes after our food was complete. The coffee was delicious the meat was perfect and their flavors were great!!",

Mushroom empanada was mushy, not crispy at all, and covered in a cold red sauce.  Whole dish was cold. Do not order.    Side of empanadas were tasty, not too sweet, and, FINALLY, hot. (Not burning though)  Wife had Bandeja Paisa. Steak was ok, fried egg was slightly undercooked, beans and rice tasteless, pork was not good.  Whole plate was cold.

There is a register in the front behind the counter. I don't even know if there is a host/hostess or if you seat yourself. I lucked out and just kinda drifted in the right direction towards the register and a spaced out employee.  Unfortunately, I can't really judge the coffee or food- I'm a tea drinker. It's a little pricey for the size and what you get. I was super unimpressed with my unsweetened iced black tea. Meh. There's a juice bar down the way that is much more satisfying (IMO).",

She: Chilaquiles and an iced coffee drink. Moi: Chicken Tinga omelette, hold the onions. [note: onions are not listed on the menu as an ingredient, but my Spidey senses told me to specify just in case].  She: menu said sour cream on top... none present. These were NOT Chilaquiles, they were nachos... a bed of tortillas with items on top and popped in the salamander to melt the cheese.  Moi: ONIONS in the omelette! Nuff said. No coffee refills. I had to go up to the counter to get my java filled.  I asked for Paul the manager to come by. He pulled up a chair and pretended to care (sarcasm emoticon). He said he saw sour cream being placed on her dish (effectively calling her a liar). He said their Tinga's are made with onions (as if any child knows this to be True). He nodded and acted and asked what we wanted. I said \"just to be heard\".  All that being said, the food was yummy and the coffee very well done.  Enjoy if you go...",

    "text": "I love the Makers & Finders downtown so I was pretty stoked that there was a location slightly closer to home. But I gotta say I was a bit disappointed, mainly because of the service. The quality of food is the same as the original location. But the service here needs some work.   My boo and I came here on a Saturday around 3. It was pretty busy but there were several open tables. We were told the wait would be about 5 minutes while they prepared the tables. After a while, the hostess proceeded to take us near the back where there was a large communal table to seat us there. Why did she just assume we were okay with sitting there rather than asking us first? I don't want to sit with other people when there's plenty of other tables. We told her we wanted a table in which she responded by saying it would be a few more moments.   I observed her slowly putting utensils at the tables and stopping to greet some other guests. I'm pretty cranky when I'm hungry so I was a bit annoyed that she couldn't just seat us. When she finally did seat us, she didn't even have utensils there. It was just the fact that she lacked a sense of urgency when it was apparent that it was busy that was irritating. I don't think the world revolves around me but I also have had better service elsewhere (i.e. M&F downtown location).   Anyways, after being seated, our server was nice but was no where to be seen at the end of our meal when we wanted to pay to leave. We just wanted to get out of there but had multiple different people help us with the payment process. It was unnecessarily prolonged due to inattentiveness from the staff in general. I am definitely going to stick to the other location.",

I ordered the lunch power bowl, and it was pretty good. The chicken was juicy and cooked thoroughly. I was quite surprised by the large portion; I even had enough left over to take home for another meal. For my drink, I ordered an iced lavender infused latte, and it was really good! You can definitely taste the lavender, but it doesn't taste like soap. It was very pleasant, and I recommend it to people who are looking for a unique twist to a latte!  The reason I took off a star is that my latte and food took almost 30-40 minutes to come out. Also, I think it was the manager who we asked for our check (because he was doing it for other customers as well), but he was quickly distracted after talking to another table for almost 10 minutes and forgot about our check. However, the servers and hostess were very nice and quick.",

Swooped in on a busy Sunday morning to grab some java to go. Ordered the Honey Vanilla Latte with almond milk from the lovely gentleman behind the coffee bar. Pro-tip, you can pass by the host stand and walk right up to the counter behind it. There you can place your order and wait on the comfy couch for them to call your name.   Although the man behind the coffee beans was quick, I did think that it would be more efficient if they ran that coffee bar with three people. One taking orders, one prepping the cups, one person on the bar. I noticed the host was missing quite often too. This place is popping and it may run more efficiently up front if they had a host taking names and another host to escort guests to their table. That way, the host stand is never left unattended. Just my two cents.  My coffee was delicious. Nice and hot. Creamy and sweet. A nice little Sunday treat.",

My one complaint is that the tables are pretty small, so if you are going with your laptop, the table will be very crowded with the laptop + drinks + food. I feel like that's a big downside for a coffee shop.",

It is a tight seating area so maybe not great for large groups but there is a lovely outdoor seating area. I go often just to order a coffee to go. They have unique options like a coconut turmeric or lavender latte. Amazing flavors. I drink them way too fast and always want more :)",

With lots of succulents, a million varieties of coffee, and good food, it's a pretty complete package. On the outing pictured below, I had the mango arepa and a mexi mocha. They asked me if I wanted milk substitutes before I even had to ask, which spared me my normal embarrassment of needing decaf with almond milk. I don't even like mangos, but it was friggin good. I've been trying to mimic the balsamic glaze, but I just can't. Oh well. My sister got the empanadas, which are also tasty. She also has special ordered most of their items to get no eggs because she's allergic, and they are great about recommending substitutions. Everyone who works there is super stylish, the decor is rustic, there are vegan options, and it's right next to lush. Pretty perfect.",

I first discovered this place in downtown Las Vegas in main st, so I was super excited to see this new location in downtown summerlin. This location is definitely more fast paced and busy than the other location. There's a lot of seating available and a patio area to enjoy outdoor seating. I only stopped in for my sea salt caramel latte, and the quality was the same! Ambience is great for coffee dates or to eat a good meal for lunch or dinner, not a quiet ambience to study like some other coffee shops. They have a big selection of drinks, coffee, tea, even alcohol",

It took about 20 minutes until someone came to take our drink order (mind you we sat directly next to the POS system and adjacent to the kitchen). Once we finally ordered our food it came out in a reasonable amount of time. The food was delicious. Kiddo had pancakes , we had Chicken Tinga, Smoked Salmon Toast, and eggs, bacon, and potatoes. Besides the food though, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. It was exceptionally loud. The service was not great. It took another 15 minutes until we finally handed the server our check when she walked by without acknowledging us. All in all, it seems this review is similar to most others. Average service for An above average price.",

My husband's turkey sandwich sat under the warmer while my son and I were eating our meal for 15 mins, as 4 employees were standing around on their phones.  My husband's ice tea and water was never refilled.  The service is horrible and the food was so, so.  Don't bother.

Overpriced coffee: I ordered an americano with almond milk they charged me for the almond milk. If I wanted a tiny bit of lavender syrup in it, they were going to charge me for that as well.  I ate there as well: I got the driest nachos, just hard melted cheese and jalapenos on it. I asked if the nachos come with salsa (as nachos normally do) & the manager said yes I can bring you some... and lo and behold he charged me for that as well. This place is overpriced; if they want to charge those prices they need to step up the quality of their food & the items on the menu.",

My cousin who is strictly Starbucks had a taste of my coffee and was instantly hooked. She got the same latte and we were both so happy for coming to Summerlin and stumbling upon this place.  The cashier was so kind and inviting. When my cousin ordered it was a different cashier and she repeated the order and asked if it was whole milk, which I appreciated bc it's so important to ensure accuracy.  The restaurant is bigger than I thought. They have indoor seating as well as outdoor which is great to enjoy the cool weather.  There's such a gorgeous couch in the waiting/take out side. The whole place is just so inviting.  Thankfully I live nearby so I'll be back.",

    "text": "This was a pretty good little breakfast spot in downtown Summerlin....it has nice indoor and outdoor seating however it was very busy and the tables are relatively close quarters so kinda loud with people and music considered. Now for the food I found there menu interesting with how they categorized things. Example: the between bread section and on bread section. Both had a salmon type entree. Now I love my lox and cream cheese bagel so decided to try the smoked salmon toast (on bread category) you would think it would come open face bagel style. When it came it was 2 pieces of bread and everything was piled on only one of the pieces of toast....so basically they expected you to make it into a sandwich? Lol. Very disappointed due to the fact I usually like to save half of my salmon cream cheese bagel (in this case toast) for later. Ultimately I had to divide what came on the one slice of toast between both slices and it just wasn't as good. My friend got the croissant breakfast sandwich and that was pretty good. I also got the chocolate and creme croissant and it was NOT good.....maybe my taste buds were off but I nor my friend were a fan...probably didn't help that it was a little over done.....nonetheless like I said cute place and the food looked and sounded amazing maybe my picks just weren't good. I did go for the vanilla honey latte which was absolutely delicious....I want to try the lavender next time! All in all I would give it another shot in the future and definitely worth a first timers try.",

Cute little coffee shop for you and your friends to come to and have a nice little lunch on the patio or inside. I usually come to get a coffee and I'm never displeased with their coffee. I drink it black so I'm pretty simple. Their menu is really big so they kind of lose me there but they have plenty of options and a nice vegan option if that's for you. They also offer cocktails and beers but I'm not really sure how that fits in but in all it's a cute little place to come with a date or a group of friends. It's noisy enough to where you wouldn't hear the other people's conversations. If you were on a date and were concerned about others hearing the awkward first date conversations I think it might be noisy enough to mask that. Cool little place!",

Last time I was there they were using Mexico beans and they have really good flavor. I've tried the siphon coffee as well, pretty pricy but well worth it for a hot cup of coffee.

First off check-in area, really small. Right when you walk in the door the podium for check-in is right there. No space to wait. Tons of tables in the inside make it feel a bit crowded.  I tried the coconut turmeric latte with coconut milk. Came out lukewarm so it had to be warmed up. Once it did it was so delicious. The smell of coconut and the spice of the turmeric is a good combination.  Went for the butter and berry toast and this is a must try with coffee! Toasted just right, creamy butter and compote just melt in your mouth. Will definitely be back for this.   They also have a cute patio area that is dog friendly that I loved as well. Enjoyed sitting outside with my lovely fur baby, coffee and toast.",

    "text": "Love this lively little coffee shop. They have outdoor seating which I look forward to when the weather shifts a little for the better. The food was really good with plenty of choices. I opted for the avocado toast which was delicious and a little different than what I'm used to in California. This was more of a baguette and quite hard moving a soft toast. I added salmon which was surprisingly inexpensive.  my friend also ordered us some kind of macha almond milk latte. I love exploring coffee drinks so this was a treat.   Really love the vibe here. Casual, laid back and a great catchup spot with friends.",

I eventually went over to ask him what's going on and he forgot to put in our order. That shouldn't happen if servers check on their tables frequently. Having worked in the restaurant industry for many years, that's basic knowledge. Finally got our breakfast almost an hour and a half after being seated. It wasn't even that busy and the food was mediocre. I'll never go back. There are plenty of better restaurants around Downtown Summerlin.",

A busy location we were lucky to only wait a few minutes for a table on a Saturday morning. The inside of the restaurant is on the small side, but they have a nice outdoor patio for additional seating.   We started with their unique coffees. My Honey Vanilla Latte was delicious and not too sweet. The Coconut Tumeric Latte was also very good. Both were beautifully served like pieces of coffee art.  The House Empanadas had a delicious and flaky pastry. The filling inside and sauce on top were delicious too. My Chicken Tinga Benny was amazing. The chicken was nicely flavored, the eggs were perfectly poached, and the lime avocado cream really set off the other flavors. The Latin Hash + Maple Bacon was also a great meal. Everything we had was full of flavor.",

He added and extra egg and was happy he did because there was a lot of short rib in the skillet. I had the basic bacon,eggs,and potatoes. Everything tasted so fresh especially the potatoes.

The coffee is always on point and the menu is interesting and extensive, but the service is subpar at best. Not only does the food take much longer to prepare than most places, but there seems to be a poor system in place for the food to actually make it to the table. During my most recent visit, I stared at 3/4 prepared plates for my table sit on the bar for close to 10 minutes before it made its way over. By the time it got there, the food was lukewarm. The last meal finally made its way another 10 minutes after that only to find that the eggs were under cooked and inedible. I'll be spending my time and money on one of the other great, local breakfast spots popping up all over town.",

    "text": "Very displeased with this establishment. The other day, my brother and I went to Makers & Finders for a lunch break. As soon as we get there, no one directs us, greets us, or anything. As we order our food, they say it'll be done it 10 minutes. Not too long right? All we got were a croissant and a bagel TO-GO. As we're waiting, 30 minutes easily passes by. By then, my brother goes up to the register and there was a young lady with red hair just staring at him. As he was standing there for a good five minutes- NO ONE asked him if he needed anything. He had to keep saying excuse before anyone would notice, which is ironic because there were multiple workers just staring and not doing anything. They tell us our food will be right out! As they're saying that, I can see our food just laying there and another 5 minutes pass by. By then, my brother and I are ready to leave the place without our food. Out of nowhere, a host asks us if everything is okay and if we got our food. I kindly said no but thank you, and shortly after someone right behind arrived with our food.   After that whole experience we didn't even get to eat our food because waited for 40 minutes! That took up our whole lunch. Sadly enough, our bagel and croissant were cold. It made me so upset. Later that day I called, asked for a manager and told him my experience. I was really kind over the phone but he just kept shutting me down. I stated how I work in a place where customer service is valued and I just wanted you to be aware of your work environment. You know what he said? He said \"What do you want me to do? I know my staff try to do their best everyday and I can assure you they are a good team\" this made me so upset because he didn't even acknowledge our experience as a whole but rather just defended his \"team\". There's other better coffee shops in Vegas. You can most definitely miss this one, you'd probably regret just going here- like I did.",

Other times it tastes like the barista has never made them before.  And not a subtle difference but a whole different recipe.  Makers and Finders is a cool spot.  Love that they opened in DTS.

    "text": "I've heard many good things about the downtown location so after a little shopping trip I decided to come inside for a quick bite and some coffee.  Service: 2 out of 5 It wasn't busy at all when I came in, with only one table of customers outside and a table of customers inside, so tell me why it took three workers fifteen minutes to seat me, a single person, at the bar? The redhead at the cash register asked if I was gonna order to go or for dining in, and I said dining in for one. After waiting for about ten minutes, a party of three had come in, and they were seated almost immediately by a male host, but it took another few minutes for a female host with short brown hair to finally notice me. I wish I had gotten her name, aside from the coffee, she was the only delightful thing about my experience.   Food: 2.5 out of 5 I ordered the \"ripened mango arepa\" which came with rice, fried plantain chips, and balsamic reduction. The mango was so unripe, I thought it was pineapple at first. Pale yellow in color, crunchy, somehow both sour and bland at the same time, it was not pleasant at all. The balsamic didn't add anything to the already sour mangoes, and the mozzarella cheese faded to the background. The arepa itself was tough and dense. Would not recommend. The plantains were the only redeeming thing on the plate, and they weren't even the main event.  Coffee: 3.5 out of 5 I had the iced lavender latte with almond milk instead of regular. They make their syrups in house which is nice. I liked the little bits of lavender at the top, and it wasn't overly sweet. However, the coffee wasn't mind blowing, and at $6, I left feeling like I could get this drink elsewhere for the same price, if not cheaper, and definitely with much better service.  I rounded up to a 3 because the one server was nice, and the coffee is decent if you're in the area and just want to stop in for a to-go order, but with ignorant wait staff and underwhelming food, I'd rather go somewhere else for my aesthetic brunch fantasies. I still tipped 20% because I also work in the service industry so I understand how it is. I had high hopes for the Latin-inspired menu, but left feeling uninspired. Hopefully the downtown location has better service.",

It was strange because guests with 2 in their party were at tables for 3+ people... when I have visited previously with one other person, we've had to wait for a 2 person table because the same hostess said her manager doesn't like when a smaller party sits at them.   The food tasted like it was rushed to be prepared. The bagel was not toasted as it usually was and the appearance was messy. The caramel latte wasn't as good as usual.  We were seated and ate in a shorter period of time than it took to be seated and get our check/pay.  One pro about this place- the waitress with black hair is great at her job. She always recognizes me and asks how I am doing, even when I am not in her section.",

Doesn't seem fair especially since we had shown up first and had already waited 20 minutes... when they had only waited for 5 minutes. 10 minutes later the host sat us at a community table. The only reason we come to this location is for the food and location. Other than that I suggest going to the one in the art district!",

I really wish I would've been hungry because the menu looked so good. There were lots of vegetarian options. I will definitely be coming back to try the food menu. We ordered a cafe con leche and hot chocolate. The hot chocolate was served with homemade whipped cream and cinnamon on top. The cafe con leche was delicious too.

We went as a group of 4 for Sunday brunch, and it sure wasn't their busiest time of the day because of how many open tables there were. Coffee comes out great (as always) but the food took more than 30 minutes to make it to the table (again, as always).  I ordered eggs and bacon a la carte with a side of their short ribs - as basic as it gets. I take one bite into my food and it's cold. Not luke-warm, COLD. I let the waiter know and he didn't seem so thrilled that I said something - maybe he was just embarrassed? Idk.  Food comes back out of the microwave, we eat, we leave. About 6 hours later I find myself laid up with food poisoning and you really, really don't want to know how I could guarantee you that it was the short-ribs.   It's obvious that the food was ready way before the waiter brought it out to me, hence the reason why it was cold. This is what made me sick. I'm not an expert but I'm pretty sure rule number 1 of food safety is to serve it at the proper temperature. But this seems to be the common theme of my trips to Makers at both locations. Their menu boasts variety and exclusivity, their coffee and tea selection is out of this world (nobody else is bringing a French press to your table), but they really can't get it together when it comes to service. It doesn't matter if I only order a sandwich - I'm always waiting way too long.  Sorry Makers, I've given you one too many chances and now my body is paying the consequences for your crap service.",

We didn't even get to eat here because the hostess, a younger white blonde girl on Sunday 2-24 at 11:40am was suppose to putting people name down on a list for a table. We were waiting for her to put our names down and when she finally came back to the stand after 10minutes, instead of asking who was next in line she decided to put two other parties that just walked in before us and didn't bother to ask at all if we were helped. We were politely waiting for awhile. When we confronted her about the fact that she put parties ahead of us she decided to say \"oh they approached me first\"....so I guess that's how lines work in this place. If they can't staff properly or train the host why run a business in the service industry. It's obviously a popular brunch spot but super understaffed and unprofessional. Very disappointed in the service and rudeness. If you want to eat here on a weekend better come early and hope they see you to put your name down because there is no real system there!!!",

The quality of the food is just as good as the original place! From chilaquiles to arepas,I love the Latin flair!! The items I have ordered so far have been the arepa Benedict, lavender latte, coconut turmeric latte, and the coconut chia pudding. Can't go wrong with that! My only complaint would be that when my friend and I first entered the place, it took a long time for someone to check in with us. Other than that, I am so happy that I don't have to go to downtown for this place!!",

The restaurant is nicely decorated with seating inside and outside. We ate outside, which was great since the weather was nice. We ordered Brussel sprouts, which tasted amazing. My daughter, whom doesn't eat Brussel sprouts, even loved them. They were a nice portion size. I loved the small cast iron skillet it's served in. We also had the crispy fries, they come with kale and an aioli sauce. I would have never put those ingredients together with fries but man it was so delicious. We will eat here again. My daughter had a specialty coffee and she said it was great.",

    "text": "My first visit on a cold & windy Sunday brunch day coupled with bottomless mimosas...  Makers service:  We knew we were walking in during prime time at 12:30 PM on a Sunday so we were ok with the 15 minute wait.    Our avocado toast came out immediately and there was about a 20 minute wait for our main entrees, all good.Our server was friendly and was extremely busy with the brunch crowd.  He was good with keeping the waters filled and our bottomless mimosas, bottomless.  What's even better is that two more servers would bring mimosas when our glasses were empty even though they weren't assigned to our table.  Great stuff.  FYI.  The bottomless mimosas is for two hours which works for me.  Makers Cuisine:  You get 1 poached egg and plenty of smashed avocado and cherry tomatoes on your four pieces of toast.  The ingredients were fresh which made for a tasty starter.  I had the Latin hash 2.0 skillet which was very tasty.  The short rib was flavorful which really made the dish.  Fyi, this dish is served in a smaller skillet pan which I actually preferred.  I tried the bff's Lomo Saltado and it was delicious.  Served with a fried egg and fries, I'm absolutely ordering this on the next visit.  Makers ambiance:  A long but narrow dining area makes up the main dining room.  There's also a bar for single diners which faces the kitchen.  There's also outdoor dining for when the weather is nice.  Decor color is predominantly white which makes for a pleasant dining experience overall.  It's going to be noisy when it's busy because they pack a lot of tables in there but nothing uncomfortable.  Overall this is a great place to grab some breakfast and brunch if you're in the Downtown Summerlin  area.  They also have a to go counter if you're on the move which I appreciate.  Lots of dishes to choose from with fresh ingredients will bring me back. Enjoy..!",

I got the chorizo mushroom omelet and it was decent but I'm not really a chorizo fan I just didn't know what else to order. All the breakfast menu items have some type of combination I just didn't find appetizing. I would definitely come back for lunch and try something new.",

There were 4 on the list ahead of us and were told 1/2 hour wait.  We were back after 1/2 hr and waited inside for another 10 minutes. There were several tables available inside and outside.  But more people are coming in and asked to wait. We finally sat down and placed our orders right away (chilaquiles and waffle).  Waited another 1/2 hour for our food to come out and no watery coffee refills (thank goodness) and no sign of our server. Our food was good but it would've been good if it was hot. I thought of ordering a special coffee to go but was afraid I may have to wait another 1/2 hour for it.",

We were greeted warmly by a friendly server who sat us immediately wherever we found suitable and met us very shortly afterwards with some water.  I can't comment on food or coffee as we chose to have a few alcoholic drinks, but the menu was varied and comprehensive, the server answered questions I had about flavours and offered me some tasters before committing so that I could pick something I would truly enjoy.  We ended up choosing the Kronenburg beer and the Makers and Mimosas cocktail. Both were delicious, however, for the price of the cocktail ($16) I wasn't expecting to have each ingredient arrive individually and be the one to make the cocktail myself. I realise that M&F seem to be attempting to do something a little different, more creative, fun and interesting with this, but after a couple of these cocktails and not much yet to soak it up, I would've been happier to receive this ready to drink rather than feel like I'm creating a science experiment with various glasses of juices and syrups.  Regardless, great service, atmosphere and delicious product. We'll be back again soon to try the coffees and snacks next time!",

It was very slow & inattentive. I ordered an iced chai  tea latte and the tomato, basil & a bagel w/avocado. The iced chai came out fairly quickly and since ordered something very simple (no cooking required) I figured it would have come out soon enough. Nope. It came out 40 minutes after we had ordered. 40 minutes to toast my bagel and add a few things to it? I don't think so.  Wish the service was better. I would totally come back here all the time if it was!",

I ordered the Latin Hash which was pretty good, but I like spice so I added hot sauce to it. My friend ordered the Chicken Tinga Omelet which was also very good.  I also ordered a hibiscus mimosa which comes in a cute little mason jar. My only complaint was the lack of attention received by the staff. It took about ten minutes for someone to ask us for our drink order and then another ten for said drinks to be served. I understand breakfast service can be busy, but considering the number of servers that walked past us I thought it was a bit unnecessary. Overall experience was good and its a trendy spot that I'd recommend to people in the area looking for a breakfast/brunch spot in DTS.",

They offer outdoor seating for those that are interested and apparently it's pet friendly. Service was friendly and I was checked up on frequently but not to a point where it got annoying. Onto the food!  I decided to try:  Breakfast empanadas: I loved loved loved the pastry they used for the empanadas. It's super light, flakey, with a slightly sweet flavor to it. I ate these so fast that I didn't even look what was inside (I was starving) it but I do know for sure it has eggs and potatoes!  Latin Hash 2.0: this dish would've been better if it wasn't so oily! The bottom of the skillet was really oily to a point where I couldn't finish it. I did, however, enjoyed the pulled beef.   Matcha latte: while this was good, it wasn't a favorite. I like my matcha latte to have more of an earthy flavor and this does not. It was also a bit sweeter than I liked. Next time if I do decide to get it, I'll ask for less sweetness. The presentation was pretty though. It was Instagram worthy :D   My main reason for the 4 stars was the empanadas and the service! I have my eye on the empanadas platter for next time!",

    "text": "Take my hand let me guide you on a wonderful journey to delicious desserts and unbelievable coffee!  After some retail therapy in beautiful Summerlin one gets low on fuel, but lucky for us we found some delicious fuel! This is the second location of this local Vegas business. This being an extension of the downtown location, expect nothing but superb service, delicious food, and spectacular drinks.   On this visit we were renewing our spirits with exquisite delicious desserts. Is their really a reason to eat dessert first? No so let's explore the tantalizing treats makers offers that we savored.  -Espresso Flan, ordinary flan that has a shot of espresso baked inside of it, then has been covered in a lush espresso glaze. On the top is sea salted whip cream with strawberries all overthe plate. It's a heavenly masterpiece!  -Affogato which is an espresso shot over some kind of gelato. Makers affogato is a double espresso shot \"drowned\" in a scoop of vanilla gelato. The espresso brewed here at Makers is so smooth. As the espresso is poured over the gelato your mouth water for that enticing liquid. -Elvis Press dedicated to a great contributor of rock n roll. Elvis called Sin City his home away from home, and even he would be all shook up with this delightful dish. Nutella, peanut butter, plantains, and bacon share the same space on a croissant . Surrounding the croissant is a wonderful array of seasonal fruit, on this visit the fruit was blueberries and strawberries. All the fruit was fresh and made to order. This mixture was so yummy! Highly recommended both by the staff and customers alike.  The desserts here at Makers are pairings that one could enjoy as dessert or as a breakfast dish. Most of the desserts offer so much fruit that it's hard to classify them as dessert. The thought that has gone into preparing the exquisite menu and delicious creations is incredible.  Now that dessert is out of the way it's time for breakfast. My choice was a sizzling hot skillet that Makers calls Vegan Hash. While the Vegan Hash is a delightful vegan dish, I would recommend this to anyone. It is full of incredible flavor. The skillet includes chive cooked potatoes, with mushroom, asparagus, peppers, and onion. This mouthwatering mix can have avocado added which, of course is optional butadds even more dynamic taste. To pair with this fantastic skillet a salted caramel latte. The Caramel Latte was outstanding. The amount of caramel used was an equal balance to the Espresso. As you sip the latte the hints of rich caramel were in every amazing drink. Choosing to have almond milk in the latte only enhances its flavor more. The froth on top of the latte has a delicious caramel drizzle too!  Another noteworthy honorary mention here at Makers is the customer service. The team of associates from the moment that we arrived till the time we exited was so warm and wonderful. Makers and Finders employees some of the finest and most skillful individuals. They are truly genuine souls that have the ability to spread such joy to all those that decide to walk through their doors. It is an incredible accomplishment to be able to sit and relax for hours among beautiful family and friends and feel so special while enjoying such fine cuisine and top notch beverages!",

It's a soft white inside their cafe and their menu has a variety of items to try! Their greeter was also very friendly and nice. They even have an outside patio, perfect for a day with beautiful weather!   I only wanted to try their coffee for this visit and was extremely impressed by the drinks I got! I got their Coconut Turmeric Latte, hot. I was surprised that their smallest size and the size bigger than that both contained one shot. Maybe I'm used to my coffee spot offering more shots than most! Regardless, I thought the taste of the latte was divine! It was the right amount of a sweet and earthy taste.  My fiance got their Lavender infused Latte, iced. The first few sips were filled with lavender and was a subtle sweet! After a while, the flavor was blended with the coffee and then the lavender was really subtle for me. It was still an amazing drink. We are definitely coming back to actually have a meal here!",

His tomato soup was good but not great. Overall the food was OK. The price was insane. $90 for lunch with just a couple apps no entrees and we each had one glass of wine.

I have no idea what it is but I was to eat it all day everyday... it tastes like mashed potatoes made by the god of potatoes... imagine my shock when I discovered a yucca is some kind of root. The entire dish was perfectly cooked and seasoned and I will be back to eat it again and again. Our server was Rusty, and he was lovely. He took great care of us. Will definitely make this a regular spot.",

It's a thick whipped cream) she made sure to tell the guy that this kid is very serious about his cream  they made it happen he got extra cream in his hot coco!!   They always take such good care of us and the food and coffee is outstanding.

When we finally got to seat, it took our waitress 5 minutes to acknowledge us,and 10 more minutes to get the order. When she was taking the order she was carrying coffee and she spilled all the coffee in my husband and in the table. We were like Wtf. No manager came to us to apologize or anything. this lady keeps saying that the only thing that she can say is that she was sorry.  I was like come on now.  After that she came and said that if we wanted, she could give us a complementary meal, but that we have to wait for another table while my Husband was covered in coffee.  Our answer was like Nooooop.  We walk away and we will never be back.  This was so unprofessional, I know that shit happen but the only way that you can make a difference is by handling the situation with professionalism, she saw my husband covered in coffee and she was only concerned about wiping the table. Good Job Makers and Finders that is a terrible customer services.  \"No pic of my Husband because he didn't want his pic in this review\"",

Almost went up to the counter myself. Not to mention never followed up with me during my meal for me to tell him about the eggs not being cooked correctly.   The hostess was nice, the General atmosphere was pleasant. But for a $14 Benny that wasn't cooked correctly, and a $7 coffee with terrible service I won't be back.",

We were sat outside in a cramped corner outside in the heat. They had a swamp cooler outside where we had to ask for it to be turned on. In 104 degree weather. Our hostess did not hold the door for us not even the mother pushing the stroller. All the staff that Day was very monotone and rude. We waited and hour or more for our food to arrive, in which it was cold and dry and you could tell it was sitting in the window for quite some time. Our server never came back except once to fill water. We had to asks for our checks and then proceed to the counter inside for them to be taken care of.  At the beginning of the meal I Had placed an order for a lox bagel and asked for it to be put in halfway through the meal. When we went to pay it was on the check and the people looked like they had no idea what we were talking about. We asked how long it could be in which we were told it was being prepared right now. After waiting 10 minutes asked again andbperson behind the counter was astonishing rude. We were told 15-20 min. My friend made a comment that why so long for just a bagel with cram cheese and lox. The employee snapped back at us \"Well they have orders before yours and it's a process to making it! You know it's not just a freaken bagel.\" As for all of us dining who work in restaurants, know how it is when you're in the weeds, but nonetheless would not take so long to put a \"on the fly\" order out, especially that simple. We were shocked that the employee would act out in such a violent way. A manager came said they could refund, etc. we just said we were happy to have paid, just want the sandwich; to then getting attitude from more than one employee. After much bickering and around 40 minutes we got the food and left. The sandwich was just slopped together, barely any cream cheese and just a mess.  Sad to have such a bad experience.",

    "text": "This had been a place that I'd saved for a while and figured that I'd check out on my latest trip up to Summerlin. And it was ok, but not good enough for me to want to go back.   Walking into the restaurant/coffee shop, you see how small it is. They do have some outdoor seating, and if I was to go back, I'd strongly recommend that as the inside was walking the line between cozy and cramped. With the open kitchen (usually one of my favorite things) the restaurant smelled strongly of bacon and burnt syrup. We decided to get coffee to go due to the slight wait.   I ordered the lavender fog iced. I didn't really taste the lavender and for once I felt like I wasn't given enough ice as almost all of it was melted before I even walked out the door. The drink was ok, but I ended up only finishing half of it; which is a waste, especially when it cost $5.50. My mom chose the salted caramel latte iced, and strongly recommends stirring the drink well before enjoying as the first sip was mainly salt. She finished her drink, but agreed that it was just ok, and didn't feel it was worth the $5.50.  Ultimately I won't return. There's nothing really pulling me in off the menu, and I feel like I'd have to sit outside to avoid the cramped feeling when it's busy, which would likely require a long wait. Ultimately there's just a lot of options in the same location as this coffee shop, that to me, are worth more of my time and money. I wanted to like this place, but it just wasn't in the cards.",

    "text": "3.5 stars, if possible. I met a friend for brunch at Makers & Finders this afternoon and I left with mixed emotions. At face value, this spot is beautifully decorated and glowing with natural light. It's conveniently located in Downtown Summerlin, so it's a bit more accessible for locals when compared to their Main Street location. We were seated promptly and were brought out a carafe of water moments later. After that, it took about ten minutes for a server to stop by our table. It was a bit busy, so I understood this.  I ordered the iced lavender infused latte to drink, and I was seriously impressed. The lavender was subtle, but it still had a strong enough presence to be appreciated.  I paired the latte with the avocado toast. Revoke my Millennial card--this was the first time I've had avocado toast. I was kind of confused by the concept. Is it to be eaten by hand like toast? Cut up like French toast? These are not rhetorical questions. Regardless, I feel like the dish would've benefitted from being topped with sliced or diced tomatoes, as the cherry tomatoes only complicated matters. I was also disappointed because the menu says the egg is served poached, mine seemed to be more soft-boiled in texture. The yolk was much more firm than I'd hoped and expected.  Additionally, the service also left a lot to be desired. I waited about 20 minutes for the check and a to-go cup, despite several attempts to flag down the server. I'm not sure if I'll be back. I love M & F, but I certainly prefer the DTLV location over this one.",

My first thought when getting my salad was that it looked as if there was no sauce or dressing however, after taking a bite of the steak with salad, I soon realized that it didn't need much dressing. That said, the dressing didn't stray far from literally just tasting like lime juice \"juiced\" over my salad. I was also expecting the waiter to ask how I liked my steak cooked, but he didn't, so my steak was cooked WELL-DONE. I guess in part I should have said something, but nonetheless, you would expect it from them. Initially when my salad came out with a freshly cooked steak, it wasn't so hard to eat but as the meat continuously cooled, the steak got harder and harder to eat and eventually I stopped eating because it was just so tough! Also ordered the lavender mimosa, which was recommended by my waiter because I asked for the sweeter option. It was tasty and did the job, but a bit pricey for me coming in at $9 for a little mason jar drink. All in all, I wouldn't return, which is disappointing because I really wanted to love this place as it was such a cute spot to have breakfast/lunch with friends!",

The food is absolutely delicious but the space is small so don't come during peak hours and expect a short wait, they get busy as heck and you can tell their vibe isn't about expedient service.   We came for peak lunch time on a Wednesday and we're surprisingly seated right away. We ate here a year ago on our yearly visit to Vegas and remembered it having great coffee and breakfast sandwiches. I'm so glad on this visit we ordered some empanadas filled with short rib. So scrumptious I could have eaten two more. We also got some Yuca Frites and the Parmesan garlic aioli was amazing with it. We ordered two lattes which were delicious and the espresso is VERY strong. I'll ask for one shot next time because the two had me beyond wired for hours.   Service was good and when our server got busy with other tables the manager came by to take our order.",

There is no shortage of breakfast/ brunch/ lunch places here in Las Vegas but finding one with a nice Latin twist? hmmm... Makers and Finders.  The menu options do have a bit of a healthy Latin twist but they also serve traditional dishes like Lox and Bagels and egg dishes. They also have great vegetarian and vegan options if that  is your jam. I will have to suggest the fries though, which pretty much go with breakfast and lunch! They are crispy and topped with kale which is a nice touch and makes you feel they are a healthy option ;).  There is a nice selection of coffee drinks to suit everyone's tastes.I ordered the  Mexican Spice latte and for those who like a bite at the end, this definitely has a nice bite to it! I tried a bit of the Bon Bon Layered and that was yummy and rich tasting.  This is such a cute place for brunch in Downtown Summerlin! High up there with recommendations!!",

Not really enticing us to stay... but we decided to give it a go. After ordering and about to take a sip of water, we noticed small hairs in the water. Likely from a towel than a human, but still.. who wants to drink towel hairs? Lol. The food was good, I try not to think about if there was any unsanitary things that occurred while it was prepared. As my husband and I are about to leave, he also notices this in our water (see photo). A piece of chicken. Gross. Definitely not coming back until there's a change in the way they clean their restaurant. Two stars cause the food was decent at least.",

My friends and I went on New Years day for Brunch and only had to wait for about 5 minutes before we were seated at a high table. Both the gal who seated us and guy who served us were really nice and made you feel welcome in this cool little place.  First, we placed our orders for drinks which included a very strong and delicious cold brew coffee. Then we ordered a churro waffle to share as an appetizer which was brilliant! I didnt have too much cuz carbs, but every breath I had was just a delight.   I ordered the rib eye with scrambled eggs and potatoes which came in a small skillet. The rib eye was good but a bit fatty. The combination of the eggs potatoes and Rib eye was good but I wouldn't order it again. Everything else was good though which is why they get 4 stars! I will for sure have to come back here and try something else!",

With that being said, expect a wait before being seated even on a WEEKDAY during lunch.  I always order the Smoked Salmon Benedict. IT IS SO GOOD! I especially love that they use this cornbread kind of biscuit. It's a tad sweat and very mosit and it just pairs so well with the kale, poached egg, and the saltiness of the smoked salmon. UGH! SO GOOD. I could literally eat this every morning if I had it my way. My husband always orders the Latin Hash since our very first visit a year ago. So I'd say that that's pretty good. Would be better with a side of rice.  Okay, this time since one of my friends was in a time crunch and the only seating was outside, we sat outside. I honestly like sitting outside because it wasn't too bad for midday during June in Vegas. For some reason, the service was SUPER slow. Not sure if out server was aware that he had been seated, but it did take him a minute after getting our waters to take our order. He seemed kinda irritated, too. Might have been the day. My husband and I gave him the benefit of the doubt because our experience has always been good here and just let it slide.  Still coming back here for brunch as always!",

The turmeric latte is very spiced but that's the expectation with this sort of drink.

Its location in downtown summerlin made it challenging to finally select for a meal as there are a lot of great options in the area. Unfortunately, after my last lunch experience at Makers & Finders...I left feeling underwhelmed.  As mentioned in other reviews, the dining space is small & you feel cramped in amongst the other guests. The waiting area is small/no existent and added to cramped feeling as more and more people stood around waiting for a table to open up.  Our table was also wobbly, despite having several napkins jammed under the legs. We had to carefully navigate our meal based on this.  Service was extremely slow. Our lunch took nearly 30 minutes longer than intended as we waited for our server to drop off and then pick up the check. I'm glad they left a small water carafe on the table because I can't imagine how they would manage to stay on top of refills.  Food was average. I had the breakfast burger and wasn't really impressed by what I received. The flavor of the burger itself was bland despite its description. Price point also felt a bit too high for what was actually given.",

After, he still kept petting the dog. I told the manager if she can tell him to wash his hands before bringing my food and she said she would. She also said that he was petting the dog because it was his friend's dog. That is not an excuse! She then approached him and I assume she told him; however, he still didn't wash his hands. I told the manager to please cancel my order and left. She was nice and gave us the coffee for free.   I know some people would not be grossed out by this, but I was!   Also, their seating arrangement in the back is awful. They have tables right by the restroom. So ,if someone takes a crap, u will be smelling it as you eat your food.  Instead, I walked 5 steps from there and ate Skinny Fats; cheaper, cleaner, and faster.",

Sad to say that BurgerKing has a better crossaintWich, for a third of the price. The best part, i guess was the smoked salmon lox, which they are not known for.

She said it had a great Lavender taste with the perfect balance of sweetness and espresso. I had a Hibiscus tea which tasted good, exactly like it should. Great refreshments to enjoy while being out with friends and chatting together. The only thing what bothered me was the loud music. You barely can hear the other person you are talking to. I had a feeling like I was in a club and not a coffee shop. That's the only thing that made me feel uncomfortable. In total staff was kind and friendly. Store is clean.",

    "text": "This wonderful coffee shop is located right in the heart of Downtown Summerlin next to my favorite cosmetic boutique LUSH at the food court. They not only have amazing coffees and matchas but also amazing hot food with Vegan dishes on the menu. Their deep fried empanadas (shrimp Ajillo ) were delicious and are definitely a must try item. I also loved their Tomato bisque soup with a piece of melty cheesy croissant sandwich on the side.  The restaurant's manager Christian was looking around to make sure everyone was enjoying their experience and we felt that everyone was treated special at Makers and Finders. Our server Sarah was very hospitable and when she was busy, the other server with tattoos and a beard stepped in to assist.  Everyone at Makers and Finders made us feel special.  We can't wait to return.",

During our wait, a 10-top left and they left the table open for whatever reason. We see MANY people come in, ask for wait time, then leave. We finally get a table and it would be another 5 min to get greeted. At this point we knew what we wanted and just ordered. During this time, more people came and left. Some were sticking out the wait time. The amount of business this restaurant loses just from wait times is ridiculous. Food came. We ate. Okay but not something that would want you to come back. Never saw server until we started stacking our dirty dishes. I was worried about taking care of our check. One of the few times I wished I had cash. We paid and left. As we walked backed to the car, we both agreed at least we tried it once. Probably never again.",

I ordered an avocado toast expecting it to be light, but to my surprise it was seriously very filling. On top of the avocado was a fried egg and cherry tomatoes. It was definitely a lot better than I expected and above average when it comes to avocado toast. It also comes with potatoes on the side, which went perfectly with the meal. It's definitely a great stop for a break while shopping in the Downtown Summerlin area.",

I was beyond disappointed not by the food and drink, but by the blatant disregard and racism that our server displayed ever so quickly. I hate to judge an establishment based off the actions of a single racist employee but unfortunately due to this employees actions they will never receive my business again. I will definitely be making my friends and family aware of the type of people that are employed here. No one should ever be made to feel that they are less than based on the color of the  Yesterday afternoon, my family and i went to this establishment. First, it was myself, my sister and my fiance. My sister and I are both caucasian and my fiance is African American. We sat at the table and waited to place our order. The server, also a male minority, was very clear he had no interest in acknowledging my partner. He came to take our order and first asked my sister for hers, then mine, instead of then asking my  fiance what he would like, our server simply walked away from the table. Ok, maybe it was an over sight? Let's not over react. We sat patiently, feeling uncomfortable. My parents then walked in, and took a seat at the table. Our server then came over to ask what they would like, he took my fathers order and then my moms, and again, walked away from the table without even acknowledging my fiance's presence. At this point it was clear that there was no over sight, he simply believed that my partner was less than and did not deserve his time or service. We got up and walked out of the establishment and will never be back.",

We weren't the only ones unhappy about the service, but It seemed that some guests got much faster service then others. second time we ordered coffee it took about 30 min to come out. Even trying to pay the check took at least 20 min. The coffee was really good and the food was decent but a little overpriced for what you get.

I'm guessing they use the same tap water for their coffee which is disappointing since I wouldn't even use tap water at home!",

Yesterday I took my wife for lunch to the Summerlin location of Makers and Finders Coffee and had the most horrible experience I have ever had at a local restaurant! We arrived at 1:30 p.m. and was told that the wait would be about 20 minutes but we were not seated until after 2:30 p.m. The really strange part was people coming in after us were being seated right away and they were mostly parties of 2 also! I wanted to leave but my wife really wanted to try the Cuban food here so we waited. After being seated we waited at least 20 minutes before someone would take our order and after that we waited for almost 30 minutes before the waiter came back with only my food but not my wife's. He then tells us that they cannot make the dish my wife ordered because they ran out of mangoes! In almost every restaurant I have ever eaten in the waiter tells you right away if they cannot make a dish that either my wife or I order so that it gives us a chance to order something else and then bring both our orders at the same time. I have never had the experience of being served my dish and then being told that they cannot make the dish ordered by my wife! So we ended up sharing my dish because we did not want to wait for another hour for her dish. Really, terrible Mothers Day for my wife and very dissapointed at our experience here yesterday!",

    "text": "My friend and I are regulars at this establishment and love the coffee however today we were very dissatisfied at our experience. When we first walked in  at 1:15 the waitress had mumbled something. We couldn't hear her so I politely asked what she had said, and she very rudely and loudly shrieked,\" HOW ARE YOU DOING?!?!\" Then she continued to seat other guests that came in after us, even though there were plenty of seats available. Then we ordered two drinks, one empanada, and fries- a very simple order. The drinks were fantastic as always and came out very quickly. After a half an hour, we noticed that people that came in after us had gotten their food and we hadn't. We told our favorite waitress and she said she would check on it. By then, we had gotten hangry because it was 2:30 and we were hungry. Another waitress asked us if we wanted the check, however we had yet to get our food!! Finally after an hour, our original waitress went to check on our food. They hadn't even started to make it. Fifteen minutes later, we got our food. The empanada was plated very messily with thrown on lettuce?? The fries- which we always get- were greasy, all the seasoning was on the plate and not the actual fries,  and the kale sitting in a pile on the middle of the fries. It was very obviously rushed. We would've sent it back if we hadn't been so hungry. When we told our waitress, she said she would get the manager. Because we were filled with caffeine and rage, we would've had some words to say to him/her if he would've came to our table. He never came and our waitress explained that we could have 10% off or a free refill. We chose the 10% off because we did not want to be in there any longer. The 10% barely cover tax and we were a little irked. This is our favorite place to eat and we were so disappointed. We will definitely think about coming there again",

Decided to bring my husband back because the coffee was so great. Walked in hoping to place a to go order - stood at the front for 10 minutes without a single staff member acknowledging us. Other patrons experienced the same thing and when they complained were told \"we are tending to our guests\" - so keep in mind you're only a guest if you're sitting down dining. Finally asked for a to go coffee and was told it would be a 20min wait - for a TO GO COFFEE. Because \"we are tending to our other guests\". As a coffee shop in Vegas, I wish them the best of luck attempting to get people to wait 20min for a to go coffee. I also recommend they figure out how to manage their service effectively so that they don't continue to tell people when they walk in that they don't matter until they sit down. Great product and vibe - missing the mark 100% because of poor operations and service.",

The lavender latte is AMAZING! I can't wait to go back & have another. The turmeric coconut latte is fantastic also.

The food came about 15 min after we ordered, which is fine, but only two of the three orders came out. We also had to ask about our drinks, which was just coffee and a mocha. Once the mocha was delivered, we could tell that it had been sitting there for awhile from the foam color and density. The third order finally came out, which was a cinnamon roll, and it had to be reheated since it was cold.  I'm happy to try this place again, but experience number one definitely left a lot to be desired.",

I've ordered take-out coffee from the coffee bar several time, which always seems to stun the hosts, this should be more acceptable to someone who is supposed to host!  They have a GREAT Chai Tea Latte, by the way.  After finally visiting today for lunch, I left disappointed.  While they do have limited inside seating when it's cold out, I felt as if I were rushed to get out of their restaurant so they could turn their table.  I really wanted another cup of coffee after lunch and maybe a snack but since the check was already dropped off and I was cruised by the waitress several times hoping I was done, I decided to leave.  I had a small salad with chicken and a chai tea latte for $17.  You can decide if that's expensive or not.  Where did I go to feel more relaxed and less rushed?!?!  Sambalatte in Boca Park.  That's right, I drove four miles to another coffee shop to work and have more coffee and dessert.",

A girl from behind the bar looked around a bit and then came and sat us. Our waitress never introduced herself (long reddish-brown hair? Had pretty iridescent eyeshadow on) and seemed in a hurry. She took our order, eventually brought out the food (which was absolutely delicious and pretty! - we ordered the smoked salmon and veggie benedicts), and then gave us the check. Not a single \"how's everything going\", \"how's the food\", \"would you like dessert\", \"would you like another drink\" - just dropped off the check as soon as we took our last bites and said, \"here you go. Thanks.\" It seems like a pretty chill place and it's absolutely ok to have a lax attitude to match that industrial, hipster environment but it still needs to be warm and inviting. I'd be willing to come back for the food if a friend invited me but I'm unsure if I'd choose this place again on my own.",

We got seated and ordered a lavender latte and lavender fog which were excellent! Highly recommend the coffee/tea. A few minutes later we ordered a fruit bowl, avocado toast, and vegan empanadas to share. After talking for a long while at our table, we realized there was a completely different group of people around us in the restaurant from when we first got seated. We checked the time and we ended up waiting an HOUR AND A HALF for our food! We called the server over and wanted to know why it was taking so long. He apologized and explained that the cooks were \"backed up\". We obviously know they weren't since everyone else had been served but us. (We think perhaps he forgot to place our order in.) He offered to refill our drinks or get us a pastry and we told him it was okay, we just wanted our food. He then brought out our food and it was...not impressive. Not much flavor in the empanadas and they're quite small. The fruit bowl was mediocre and it didn't look or taste fresh. And last but not least: the avocado toast was a joke. There was barely a smear of avocado. It looked more like a green spread than actual avocado. We were basically eating bread with a few cherry tomatoes. All in all the food was SO disappointing. The coffee however is fantastic. We may even return just for that...but the food? A hard pass. And more expensive than other places. So sad. We wanted to love this place. Just not a good first impression.",

    "text": "My sister and I stopped in here for lunch after the madness of the Dillards New Year's day sale. It's a small spot inside, but there is an outdoor area with heaters. There's a cozy coffeehouse vibe because (surprise) there's a bangin' coffee menu!! Cold brews, Bulletproof, Cuban, Espresso, etc!! There's also a tea menu, mimisas, and wine! The menu has gluten free, vegetarian, and vegan options. I had the Brussel Sprouts & Bacon skillet from the breakfast menu (breakfast menu available til 4pm) and bulletproof coffee. This skillet has scrambled eggs on bottom with bacon and sauteed sprouts on top. The sauce was savory and flavorful.  The sprouts just weren't cooked enough. Brussel Sprouts are not a tender vegetable to begin with and need to be well-roasted to both tenderize them and bring out the flavor. These just weren't cooked long enough :(  I did taste my sister's food, because duh! She had the breakfast empanadas and a side of maduros (fried sweet plantains with sweetened condensed milk) with a hibiscus mimosa. Now THAT was delicious! There's a creamy pepper sauce on the empanadas that had just a smidge of heat. They're filled with bacon, eggs, and potatoes. The maduros were just plain ol' perfection! They have a nice looking menu, breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Lunch is also served til 4; dinner menu only from 4pm to close. There's an area at the bar to order a to-go coffee or something from their drink menu. Make it a point to stop in if you're shopping at Downtown Summerlin.",

    "text": "Came here on a crisp Saturday morning just to break out of my breakfast rut.   Zeus's Beard! Best food impulse decision I've made in a good while.   So let's start with the coffee. I had a Mexican spiced latte and I jest not, after the first taste it took every damn ounce of my will power not to skull that thing down like a dehydrated barbarian with caffeine withdrawal.   It was hot but not too hot. It was spicy but never overwhelming. The coffee flavor peeked out from behind that distinctive cinnamon flavor and all was well in my cozy little world.   Then came the Latin Hash.   Smoking nuts of Sauron! Words fail me. The tender meat. The salty potato with its outer crunch and inner fluffiness. The delectable perfectly gooey fried egg delivering that perfect dose of yolky goodness. All wrapped up in this smoky, piquant blanket of spice.   It felt like getting an unexpected hug from an old friend, but in my mouth. Think I'm exaggerating? Go try it. If it's not the best thing you've had in a month then slap my butt and call me Susan.   Final thing I have to mention. Our waitperson was a scholar and a gentleman. Really friendly and he knew the menu back to front. He also knew the story behind the goat on the wall. Gotta get points for good goat knowledge   So here's the TLDR: check this place out. Try the Latin hash. Grab the Mexican latte. Ask about the goat. Enjoy your fun filled journey to flavor town.",

When you are inside you have an option to sit down and order or a to go line. It is a small indoors area but its huge glass windows make it feel bigger. We came at 8am on a Saturday and it wasn't busy. It's ambience was very modern. The background music playing was very subtle but so groovy made me want to dance. There is only one bathroom to use and it's close to the tables were we were eating. When it's quiet you can hear it flush.  The coffee, is delicious. We got the bon bon and honestly tastes like the coffee my grandma makes. So authentic! The mexican spice latte is my favorite it really does have a subtle taste of spice and I don't mean spicy. The cortado and bon bon are small porportions and expensive. I wouldn't come here for my regular cup of joe.  The food was better proportioned and the quality was okay. I got the chilaquiles and they barely had any cheese or sour cream.The presentation of everything is was very nice. Overall this place is definitely a brunch spot. I do want to try their lunch to see if im more impressed.",

This time I had the iced lavender infused latte just as good as I remember it.  My daughter got a matcha tea and loved it.  My two younger kids got lemonade and they liked it because it was not too sweet and not too sour.    Another thing I  appreciated was how quick they got the drinks ready.  We were in and out in about 5 minutes.  They do sell food too but I just went in for drinks to go.",

    "text": "Don't let this place confuse you for an over hyped coffee shop. The reason I say that is because people seem to be confused as to what Makers & Finders Coffee in Downtown summerlin is due to the positioning of the space and the \"name\".  But what you do find is that these makers don't just whip up a tasty fresh cup of Joe. They come through when its crunch time. After breakfast and before lunchtime. Yes that would be Brunch time. All you guys with girlfriends or wives who love brunch and a hot French press in Downtown Summerlin vs. your regular pancake and omelette house vibe, here you go !  if you are  by yourself there's a place at the bar with power outlets or if you brought the pup with you they have a dog friendly patio too.   The Coffee & Tea & Espresso Bar  Cafe con Leche , Cold Brew  They even have a Slow Bar which focuses on quality for all the coffee nerds out there Siphon , Aeropress the works!   They Serve Japanese Matcha Too !   We tried the Mexican spice Latte & The Honey Vanilla Latte while reading the menu.   Now on to the food.   I wasn't sure what to order and know I love me some chilaquiles, i asked the server if I was heading in the right direction and he assured me with confidence I was heading down a great path. The texture of the chips and consistency of crunchiness along with the rest of the flavor of the black beans avocado over easy egg you get the idea! I've had this dish hundreds of time all over the country and throughout Mexico  and these were great.   We also ordered the nova lox Benny and it was delicioso! Heaven in every bite I'm getting hungry all over again just thinking about it!   As i mentioned before Some people may be confused about this place as I was initially , they should probably have more than one hostess one taking names and one seating people when it gets really busy and perhaps explaining to the guest they can just go get coffee at the coffee bar or have their name put down for some grub.",

It's not worth the hype and i prefer other places instead of this one. It's hard for me to write semi negative reviews but the food was just horrible and over priced over-priced.   The interior was modern & very hipster. They had cactus and simple decorations throughout. There was people with laptops studying and doing work and it wasn't noisy at all. They offer a patio with dogs allowed and sofas inside as well. It was a relaxing and calming atmosphere so it was a chill hangout spot as well to just socialize. They give you a big jar of complimentary water as well.  They have an ok ranged menu with latin food with coffee/teas. And the service was good, our waiter checked on us frequently and asked if we had any questions. So the concept is that we get seated then get up to order apparently which is a bit odd.   I just want to try the other location as well and maybe update my review later on but it's really a bad experience but maybe downtown summerlin will be better!  They also have new hours!!;  Mon-Thur (7am-8pm)  Fri-Sat (7am-9pm)  Sun (9am-3pm)   What we ordered:   Hibiscus Iced Tea: Super water down and little flavor 2/5  Berry Parfait: Wasn't fresh berries and it tasted straight up LIKE MEAT. Maybe the knife wasn't clean and they cut fruits afterwards but it was nasty.  Overall i don't recommend this place, it's a nice cafe don't get me wrong just not my cup of tea :)",

    "text": "We were desperate for coffee. Desperate. Wandered into MTO and nah, that's nice, looks healthy, they have an espresso machine, but I was thinking mixology magic my dude can't do at home. There's got to be a good coffee house in Downtown Summerlin, right?!   Did this just open? Possible. They were bustling. This was noonish on a Friday, and I'm a little hangry from water shoe shopping. The sign outside said COFFEE LATIN BRUNCH. Bingo.   I got a coconut turmeric latte, since that seems to be all the rage in anti-inflammation supplements. Coconut syrup (less cloyingly sweet, doesn't coat your tongue like cane sugar, and not fake sweet), coconut milk, a shot of espresso, and cinnamon, also reported to help swelling decrease. I can't say that's why I got it, but it was with some trepidation I took the first sip. Yes. That works. My man got a salted caramel latte with an extra shot. I took turned sipping between the two because who doesn't like dessert first.   Breakfast was the aprepa (sorry for the spelling) benny. Pulled beef, hollandaise, and spinach on a corn fritter. God-D@#*. And the kale Parmesan omelet with chorizo. And two breakfast empanadas from the a la carte menu. So, the chef can do eggs. This isn't a difficult task, it's a time-management task. Packed restaurant? Chances are the eggs are going to be over-poached. The poached on the benny were absolutely perfect. Same goes with the omelet, the fluffy pillow of goodness. The empanadas, I could eat five of those. The special spicy lime sauce, I believe their \"red\" was worth drinking. Whatever fat they use to fry, it ain't old, discount canola or the like. Flaky, crunchy, golden, this is how frying should be.   My only complaint is that the omelet didn't fair well with powerhouse flavors. Between the benny, empanadas, and two sweet coffees, it didn't stand a chance. The Parmesan and what little kale was sprinkled on top got lost.",

    "text": "Ugh how I hate writing a negative review but this is to provide feedback to the management staff b/c this place has potential. They have a great reputation with their main street location and I know this one can catch up. They're still new but after a month of being open, I was hoping the operation would be better.  The negatives: bath-water warm coffee, cold food and slow slow service.  The Pros: great ambiance, nice mgrs, great location, super cute coffee bar, great flavor food, vegan/vegetarian & gluten free options, great potential  4 of us came in for Sunday brunch and they had a small 20 min wait. The wait took longer then 20 mins but we weren't in a hurry. After sitting down we were immediately greeted by our server with water and said he said he would be right back.  Took about 10-15 minutes for his return and he took our drink orders and answered a few food questions for us. When our 4 coffees finally arrived, we immediately dove in and were disappointed as our coffees were not hot. Only 1 latte came out somewhat hot, the other 3 were bath-water warm. We were so disappointed bc these aren't cheap lattes but the service was already lacking at this point and there was still a crowd so we decided to just drink it but every sip just wasn't as enjoyable has a fresh hot latte.   Regarding food, the food had great flavor but came out look warm, never hot. Our hot ordered items included 2 soups, empanadas, veggie burger, and salmon Benedict. The soups were sent back and the mgrs were nice about it and when the soups returned, they were so good! So much flavor! Everything else had lots of delicious flavor but please note the veggie burger is the Garden Burger black bean burger you can purchase at the store. I buy these all the time for my house so I was extremely disappointed when I recognized it after my 1st bite b/c I expected something different and original.   This restaraunt includes a walk up coffee bar window to order your drinks to go, a puppy friendly patio and they just recently started serving beer and wine. The wine is served in small mason jars and super cute.  I hate leaving a negative review, esp for a location I have been patiently waiting to open but after spending $130 for our bill plus tip, we left very disappointed. I'm hoping after another month of being open this location will be much better.",

Completely understandable that a group of 11 people on a Sunday at 11 am would need to wait a while. We walked around downtown Summerlin for an hour and came back. Had to wait another 20 minutes for the tables. Again, no problem. Understandable. When they take us to the table we see a 2 top, a 4 top, and another 2 top together with an additional chair on each end. So a total of 10 chairs at the most and even then it's crowded! We call the host and ask for another 2 top to be added. At this point the place had emptied out a little and there was plenty of room. The server says \"Sorry, the manager says this is all we can add\"! SAY WHAT???!!!! So you telling me that we waited AN HOUR AND A HALF for a table for 11 people, and now all you can fit is 10! The manager comes over and says that they will make it work. Excuse me but there is ZERO chance that 11 people can eat comfortably at this table. Their entire attitude was rude and arrogant as I will never come back here again.",

It was perfect for this cold weather and tasted great. The food was excellent we tried the burger and the bandeja plate, great flavors. There reputation from there down town Las Vegas location definitely holds up. This is our new favorite local spot.",

Takeout is fast and easy, even if you may think it's a little awkward, they do what they can with the space that's given. The coffee/espresso selection and tea drinks are great. A few items, particularly their lunch sandwiches, wings, and breakfast (good quality eggs, good bacon, and a great selection of a la carte additions like chicken ting) are very good. I wish that the empanadas were more consistent and that they worked harder on improving the flavor and texture of their main entrees, would be nice to have truly tasty arepas with my coffee. The coffee flan is delicious. There's a reason why this place is consistently busy, It's just obvious they're understaffed and need to hire more servers, the turnover time between a party leaving and new one being seated is very slow even when the waiting area is packed. Overall, awesome feeling for the tastebuds if you're looking for good coffee, tea, and breakfast.",

He ordered moka pot worth of $7 which was disgusting. On top of everything it was not even in a pot but a 12oz glass cup. It took us another 15 minutes to get our bill. We both left without drinking our drinks and paying $15. Nobody even tried to ask why are we leaving without drinking our drinks. Such a bad experience. Never again.",

The wait times are ridiculous and it's not busy. The salad came with no dressing. Waited almost half an hour for an avocado relleno, mind you there is no cooking involved. Makers & Finders (the DT location) makes the BEST lavender latte in town hands down. I stopped by this location hoping to get the same but it was a complete let down. It was just espresso with almond milk. When I let the them know there was no lavender in my lavender latte, it was tasteless, the barista argued that it WAS a lavender latte and spoke to me as if it was my first time having one instead of just correcting her error. Looks like I'll have to continue driving to the original location because I wont be back here and I'm definitely not recommending this location to anyone! Not to say Johnny isn't working his ass off, poor guy's running back & forth trying to keep it all together, doing a great job. This location just sucks.",

    "text": "If we could give 0 starts we would, or maybe -5. My daughter and I decided to have a little lunch in the new location at DTS thinking that maybe the service could be better than the one in downtown Las Vegas... little did we know that not only was their service worse, but we paid almost $40 for three empanadas, two slices of bread with meat in the middle, and two drinks. Let's not mention the plantain chips that were stale and could offend any Latino country that loves to eat plantains. My advice is to stay away. I still can't figure out what they \"make\", but what I can tell you is that they won't \"find\" me in their restaurant again.",

    "text": "The service was friendly and efficient. The atmosphere was bright and cheerful, with great music playing. It was also clean, although I did not use their restroom. The vegan empanada sampler includes a spicy mushroom empanada, which was just plain sauteed white mushrooms in dough. There was nothing extra, creative, nor spicy about it. Same for the sofrito empanada, which was basic soyrizo in dough. I didnt see the black bean and corn, but can only imagine. The trio was served hot and crispy, which was the best thing about them. The plantain chip triple dip comes in a sharable cast iron pan with maybe 6 chips with it. The dips weren't exciting so we didn't bother to ask for more chips, which would have had to have been way more than 6 more. Warm coconut soup was well spiced...you need to love coconut. I finished half. The soyrizo brussel sprouts were extremely greasy. No extra flavors, but not bad, just oily and messy. The beef scramble was flavor less, even with the triple dips and soyrizo added from the other dishes. $75 not very well spent. Btw, they serve Pepsi products:/ Good luck to them.",

But when my husband and I went again we waited after being seated for over 10 min(they were super slow) then the server comes and just says \"anyone take your order?\" After they were out of what I initially wanted we ordered and he finally brought us our food, didn't ask how everything was, didn't ask if we needed anything, and didn't ask if we wanted anything else. He just took our plates. I had to ask for more water and chase him down for the check since he NEVER came to our table. Its disappointing the service sucked because their drinks are really good.",

I ordered a simple pour over drip coffee and picked 12 oz size, since this place looks fancy I thought they will do drip coffee fresh for me, but I saw them went to the back, and just pour in the left over coffee they've made (not sure how long ago) into my cup, when I received the cup it feels light, so I opened it and notice it's not even 75% full, so I asked the barista nicely if he can please refill it for me since I paid for 12 oz and NOT less than 8 oz, he went back and brew me some more fresh one....but my goodness, how lazy can you be? I'm very disappointed and will not ever come back.",

    "text": "Started out great and then very quickly went downhill. Our server, Kevin, (allegedly a family member of the owner), was super friendly and spent about 5 minutes just chatting with us about the new location. We ordered some coffee drinks until our friends arrived a few minutes later. First problem- coffee was warm, not hot by any stretch. No biggie though, moving on. We place our orders for food. About 45 minutes later, our server comes back and tells us he forgot to put our order in! Wow. We laugh it off, we'll eat eventually. Another 15 minutes, our food finally comes out. My hash was not hot, and super bland. My bfs omelette was very liquid-y from the chicken, and bland as well. My friend ordered his dish with no kale, and it's smothered in kale. Server even came over and saw all the kale off to the side and said \"oh, you said no kale!\" and laughed it off. He asked how the food was and I said \"ehhhhhh it was alright,\" mostly because I wouldn't even know where to begin if I gave an actual answer. Check came, $60 for 3 of us and not even a single coffee comped off the check. Stunned. Really poor customer service, will absolutely not be returning.",

Sky made us feel welcomed and explained how things worked because it was our first time. She also talked about the menu. When she sat us, our sever (whose name we never got) took our order and he never checked on us after that, which was disappointing. We only ordered coffee, but Sky made sure we were okay here and there. We also asked another server if the heater worked because we sat outside and it was cold, he gave us an attitude right off the bat. Overall, out visit was only good because of Sky. Also, the matcha latte was bomb. :)",
