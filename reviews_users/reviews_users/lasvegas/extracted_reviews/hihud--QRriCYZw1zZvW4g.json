The food is 10 stars and also the service. All of the staff were super nice and friendly. The meat is high quality and reasonably priced. The only bad thing about it is we live in LA so we couldn't come here very often. Keep up with the good work guys. We'll be back soon :)",

Added gratuity for large parities, I totally understand and will pay it, but added gratuity when we weren't serviced does not make sense. Asked for it to be removed and they did it but no apologizes, and no sense of customer service whatsoever. Prob won't be back. Didn't feel welcome since walking through the door.",

You can order individual orders of meat (about $9.95 per plate) or you can do the prefixed meal plans from $56+ per 2 people. We got the Gangnam style $65.95 (most popular) prefixed meal for 2. The meat quality was not bad, but the marinated bulgogi was a little too sweet. The raw oysters didn't tasted as fresh as expected. Which is why I took away 1 star. Customer service was great! They have many servers nearby so getting their attention was not a issue at all.   Overall, we'll be returning in the future. The Meat Lover is the next prefixed meal for 2 we'll be trying.",

I defended this place without ever going here because of its Yelp rating stating, \"3100 people can't be wrong.\" We went here, and I found out that 3100 people can be wrong.  The staff was friendly, but maybe they were friendly because they don't have to do the traditional things a Korean BBQ would do.  We ordered a set menu for four and literally all they did was put everything on the table for us. They didn't offer to cook it for us like most places do.  Hell, the stove wasn't even turned on for us!  So if its not the service that got this place a 4.5 star rating, then what is? Well it surely wasn't the quantity of the meat.  I've never seen four men be so polite around a BBQ.  Its because we knew how scarce everything was.  We couldn't even pig out because there wasn't enough for all of us.  The one good thing about this place however, is the free ice cream macaroon they give you at the end if you check in to.................YELP!  Maybe that's why the rating is so good? Free ice cream? The macaroon was pretty good though!",

I have to say this is the best Asian BBQ I have had. The Staff members were tentative and sincere. They made sure your needs are addressed quickly and efficiently.   You have to get the Kobe Beef Carpaccio. The Gangnam combo was more than enough for two. If you have three people or even four; the Gangnam combo for two will suffice. Additional the macaroon ice cream is to die for.   This is definitely a destination every time I revisit Las Vegas",

The pork Bulgogi was a huge hit with everyone and the miso soup was very tasty! You get a ton of little side dishes as well that they bring out to the table as soon as you sit down. We took advantage of the happy hour specials, 50% off of hot sake and beers. We got 2 Apple sake's,  2 hot sake's,and beers. Our glasses never went empty. I highly recommend the apple sake. Also, If you check in on Yelp you get a free macaroon ice cream sandwich, a delightful way to finish off our great meal! Oh-& for all of that our bill was only around $35 per person! We will definitely come back here the next time we're in town.",

They have a super high value lunch menu where you get soup, banchan, edamame, rice, meat, and more for a very reasonable price. Hungry late night? The happy hour specials are ridiculous. Even when there is no special I end up not really spending much more than during the specials, and I always have enough food to take home to have another meal later. Basically this is one of my favorite KBBQ restaurants in the whole world.  Another great thing is that they have a small bar/counter seating so if you don't want to cook your own meat you can squeeze in to the bar without a wait or table hassle.",

We arrived ~5pm, still in time to enjoy the Happy Hour specials.  We got: -2 orders of Beef Toro $4x2 -Pork Belly: $4 -Cream Cheese Wonton: $3 -Sweet Corn: $2 -Chicken Karaage: $4 -Jalapeno Poppers: $4 -Prime Kalbi: $8.95 -Strawberry Macaron Ice cream sandwich: Free with Yelp Check in  The entire feast for two was only ~$40 and it was very good.  If I were to go again, I would skip the Chicken Karaage and the Cream Cheese Wonton and it would still be plenty of food for us. The set-up is more Korean than Japanese but the sauces were more yakiniku style. If you're looking for authenticity, this is not the place. However, if you're looking for good food at a great price point, head on over.",

    "text": "Eh...  I'm from OC where Korean/Japanese BBQ is abundant.  I decided to come in for a late dinner on a Thursday night with one other person.  I had tried to called earlier that day to make reservations but they didn't take any.  There was no wait when we arrived thankfully.  Once seated, we decided to go with the Gangnam Dinner ($60) out of the six options.  It included a house salad, fried dumplings, oysters, seaweed salad, miso, bibimbap, kalbi, bulgogi, choice cut, pork belly, toro, and veggies.  We also ordered extra toro and beef belly.  The best meat surprisingly was the pork belly, although it was the only one not flavored.  I also enjoyed the bulgogi.  The other cuts were average.  The bibimbap was really nothing special.  The sides were all pretty good.  The 4 oysters were gross and didn't taste that fresh.  The veggies they provided was mushrooms and bell peppers.  We also got free macaron ice creams for checking in.    We left stuffed.  You get a lot for what you pay for.  The menu and look of the place reminds me a hell lot of Gyu Kaku.  It's very very similar.  As for service, the guy waiting on us wasn't really friendly.  It was our first time and he didn't really go over the menu with us.  We also didn't get our waters refilled and kept having to ask.  For such high reviews I am really quite disappointed.  Not sure if we will ever be back.",

The portion sizes are good for two people and you get to sample several types of meats. The side dishes are not like your typical Korean BBQ which made me a bit disappointed. They serve the combos with rice, miso soup and a plain salad! I really missed my side dishes!!!! Grrr  The service is good and the price is reasonable.

Side of white rice   Total bill came out to $78.52 for 2 of us before tax  so $90ish after 15% tip.   I would say the food was 3/4 Korean and 1/4 Japanese style bbq. Korean sides are free and unlimited and if u \"volunteer\" writing a yelp review u get a free dessert  not the reason I am writing one but hey free is free...  Overall value & price I would say 4.5 out of 5 but with the good customer service it bumps to a 5! Would come back here next time I'm in town! :)  2 days later:  I love the uni bibimbap so much I had to come back here again & get it to go for the road home lol. I had some left over from the 1st time here and  it was still delicious cold. The service person on the phone was pleasant  and helpful. He recommended the bulgolgi bibimbop for the hubby! Will keep u posted on how the food tastes in the car  So here we are in Vegas again May 2016 :)  We're about to drive back home but had to stop for my favorite uni bibimbap!! This dish is served in a stone hot pot so the rice has a nice toasty taste with good amount of uni.   The quality of meat is pretty good for AYCE place but we usually order a la carte so we don't overeat before we get on the road lol.   We refer all our families and friends who are in town visiting to eat here! ;)  Til next time...",

A few of the group had oysters, which they really enjoyed. All in all it was a very fun dinner. We had two grills going!",

I came here the other week with a friend and had their Yukaejang, the flavors and everything was delicious, i'm just used to a little more ingredients in the soup rather than just a little bit of meat and broth.   Besides that no complaints from me :)",

We went mostly because it had Japanese offerings that appeared to be hibachi and not just sushi, like many others in the area have.  The meat offerings are VERY thin sliced for quick cooking, by yourself, on the grill on your table.  Kinda fun.  The birgogi was a favorite.  Six selections of condiments, including kimchi, were very good.  The bang bang shrimp was excellent.   Off the beaten path.  A la carte is the best value in Vegas.",

Secondly, the ventilation system isn't so great here and you can feel the humidity and grease in the air. Thirdly, service was slow.   I feel like since they gained popularity and are close to the strip, they nickel and dime you. You need to order a minimum of 2 bbq dishes for complimentary ban chan. Ssam (lettuce) is an extra $2. The ban chan portions are small and there's not much variety. The meat quality was so-so.   I do like how they offer a variety of menu items and even have HH which a lot of people seem to come here for. However, I feel like I can find better kbbq spots in Vegas.",

We took the choice of the \"meat lovers\" for 2. We initially wanted for 4, because my wife and I had our kids there with us, but the waitress insisted that the portions were huge, and that 2 would be best for us and our wallets. She was absolutely right. Overall just a great experience! Will make this a \"must go to\" spot every visit to vegas.",

    "text": "For Las Vegas the city of endless Buffets.. which is great. I was craving KBBQ. Thanks to Yelp I stumbled across this place and it was so so good that I forgot I was in Vegas. This place is off the strip behind the Hard Rock Hotel.  We did not have to make reservations and the wait time was the usual 15-20 min. The booths are fat friendly and the whole ambiance was friendly, hip, and music was on point. It's like a disco with KBBQ.  We  ordered the Gangnam Style ( For Four People) Combo and it was perfect. Which came with Fresh Oysters, Fried Calamari, Shishito peppers, Bibimbap and Miso Soup for the starters and then the BBQ dishes were: Korean Prime Kalbi, Flat Iron Garlic Steak,  Buttery Filet Mignon and delicious Bulgolgi all paired with a Mushroom Medley. There was so much deliciousness that it filled my KBBQ craving.  They also serve Hite Beer and Soju the perfect pair for all the meat you will be consuming.   All in all I would definitely come back to this place again. The price is right and does not break the bank. With drinks it would be $45.00 per person. I just do not know what this place is not in Eater for Vegas.",

There are about 20 tables with a Korean BBQ grill placed squarely in the middle of each. You are presented with a full menu of options for meat seafood and vegetables and I provided free appetizers like kimchi and hot pickles. We chose the premium package for 2. It came to about $89 total. We said three people on that package and had more food than we could all eat! Not only was a suit awesome. But the portions for very very generous. if you have not tried Korean BBQ, I strongly recommend you give this restaurant a try. If you have had Korean barbecue before, this will probably be the best who have ever Eaton.",

We were seated right away, and the service was quick and friendly. We ordered the tuna poke as an appetizer and had the garlic flank steak and bibimbap for our BBQ. They also brought the usual assortment of small dishes with the BBQ, like kimchi, some picked vegetables and a handful of other things that I have no idea what they were -- but, they were tasty! The poke was fantastic. And it was a rather large appetizer, too. Both beef cuts were tender and flavorful, although I did find the portion sizes a  tad small, especially considering grilling shrinks pieces down a bit. Also, I didn't love having to cook the dishes ourselves. I'm more used to the Korean BBQ places that actually cook the protein for you. Regardless, though, it was a super fun experience and I think we did a pretty good job grilling! For two people, it was just enough food. And, we had a Yelp coupon for a free mochi ice cream. We also had a couple of drinks, ordering both a sake and a couple of mixed drinks. Had we known how large the sake bottle was, we probably would have stuck with just that!  The price for both food and drink were on point. You definitely get your money's worth.  I definitely recommend Gangnam.",

    "text": "We were looking for a korean restaurant for my MIL's bday.  We didn't want to overpay for crappy food at Ginseng.  So I yelped around and found this gem.  I had no idea what to expect and trusted yelp (like I do most of the time).  I called and made a reservation for 13 on a Saturday night.  The dinner turned out great and I would definitely return. For Vegas standards, this is a good KBBQ place. Restaurant/Ambiance:  Its located right off the strip (convenient) but towards the back of the lot.  Kinda hard to see.  Restaurant is not a hole-in-the-wall type of place.  Kind of dark with all tables having a BBQ grill top.  We were fortunate enough to be given the private room in the back.  I think it can comfortably seat 15 or so with 2 grills.  It worked out well since we had a couple of small kids.  My only knock was that the table height was kinda high for the chairs.  They had tons of pillows to supplement, but made it just a tad awkward.  The place was initially empty around 5:30pm, but quickly filled up and there was a wait by the time we left around 7pm.   Service:  Service was ok.  Not up to LA standards but decent.  I thought we would get a dedicated server for our group, but through the evening, the servers would rotate to help us out.  Grills were switched out when asked.  Here they do not cater to you and cook your meat for you (like most of the LA BBQ places).  Food came out quite rapidly.  They didn't clear out our plates, but we had a table on the side that we just set all of the empty dishes.  The banchan was never refilled (we never asked).  Water was refilled when requested.  They had a really nice birthday comp (4-5 ice cream macaroons with candle).  All in all, service was decent. Food:  In a large group, you have to go with the preset menu.  We opted for the Gangnam BBQ package for 6 (next to highest package).  This came with a lot of appetizers and side dishes and 5 cuts of meat.  The appetizers included: oysters (good size ones and pretty fresh in quality), shishito peppers (really good per one of the guests), fried calamari (crunchy and meaty.  Nice spicy mayo dipping sauce too), miso soup, salad, and bulgogi bibimpap.  I really liked the bulgogi pap.  Basically meat and rice.  The cuts of meat included: bulgogi, kalbi, unmarinated steak, marinated/unmarinated prime steak.  I wished they would have included chadol as one of the selections.  YOu couldn't really substitute anything.  The meat quality was pretty good.  Good amount.  They also included 3 different dipping sauces.  Value:  If it wasn't for the combo package, I think it could have gotten a tad pricey.  You have to pay for the banchan.  I requested sahm and sahm jang, and they charged me for that.  We did the 6 person combo with 10 adults.  But we ordered a lot of other things on top (udon, 2 different soups, and more rice).  All in all, a great korean BBQ restaurant in Las Vegas.  I would def make reservations ahead of time.",

    "text": "I'm visiting my family at the moment, and I thought this would be a great place for my siblings and I to meet since they have tables big enough to seat 10 people. There are so many good reviews on this place that I expected it to blow me away.   At first glance, the place is very nice, clean, and neat. The table we were seated at was huge with 2 large stove tops. There were so many sides laid out around the stove tops, but I only liked the fish cake, kimchee, and macaroni salad. The rest were pretty bland.   We ordered 2 Meat Lovers and 2 Las Vegas to share amongst all of us. I honestly thought there would be more of the specialty meats, but there was just enough for all of us to have a little of everything. The meats were not very flavorful so I didn't actually get the names of them except for the Bulgogi which was excellent.   The servers were okay. Not very attentive. The ambiance of the place was great. Very nice to talk and catchup with my brothers and sisters. Overall, the place itself was awesome, but the food and service were mediocre. Unfortunately, I will not be going back.",

Never checked on us, didn't ask me if I wanted rice (dude, what Korean male doesn't eat rice?), no refills, and kept forgetting items we ordered (I can go on and on, but you get my point). Another individual who thinks minimum wage should be $15 per hour, but can't figure out why his tip is too low.   This place is nothing special, when compared to other traditional Korean bbqs. However, I would give this place 3 1/2 Stars if Yelp would let me.   I wish the ventilation was better here.",

Second time it wasn't served in the bowl (weird) there was no crunchy rice (no joy) and in fact the rice seemed very wet and tasted watery (I didn't know that was possible). They would have only been given two stars off of this plate but I am factoring my first meal there so I'm averaging it at three. Also I have a food allergy so the waitress was suppose to check if I could eat the side dishes they provide but she \"forgot\" to come back and tell me if I could eat them or not  which though may be an honest mistake sucks for this customer supporting the two star experience of the night.",

We particularly liked the Bulgolgi and the brisket was not fat and very yummy. The sauces they give can compliment the meat as well! However for the Spicy Pork, it wasn't needed. The Spicy Pork was marinated with a lot of sauce and wasn't too spicy.  Perfect! Also, draft beers were Half Off!!! I ordered a Sapporo beer for $2.50! That was a treat! Almost forgot to mention that you can get a free ice cream macaroon when you check in on Yelp. It was perfectly sweet for our salted pallet. You only get one but it's nicely sized.

    "text": "This place is somehow in my bookmarks list. Someone recommended it to me in case I go to Vegas. We were supposed to go to a buffet at the strip (Caesar's), but the line was too long. Luckily we found this place!   This isn't too far from the strip. It's located in a plaza and there's plenty of parking. We came around 10:40 pm and got seated in less than 10 minutes. We also got our food pretty quick after ordering. It took them 5-10 mins to get the main dishes and a total of  less than 30 mins for everything else. My only complaint is that the booth that we got (located on the right side) was very awkward to sit on for me. I'm a short Asian person. Anyone who's probably 6' and muscular/big build would sit comfortably in this booth. The seat is too far from the table. Other than this, everything is perfect.   We ordered the Gangnam Combo and substituted the Green Salad and Koshitsu Pepper Yuzu for the Broccoli Cheese Fondue and Squash Tempura. The Broccoli is okay, not really mouthwatering. My favorites are the beef toro, Korean prime kalbi, 4 out of 8 of the banchans, Mushroom Medley, and the Oysters!!! The Oysters are definitely one of the best ones I've had.   For dessert, we got the Mango Macaron Ice Cream and Tempura with Green Tea Ice Cream. Both free woot!  Overall, this competes with the Korean BBQ places in LA, but cheaper. Awesome!",

The portion is huge, even tho they wrote for 6 but if you're not one of those who's in food competition then you would have plenty for 6. From what I recall the package include 4 types of beef, shrimp, scallops, poke, prosciutto, salad and tons of banChan. I love how they gave my niece a chocolate lava cake for her bday as a gift then I checked in a got a free mango macaron icecream which both tasted super delicious. Food and serving wise are both wonderful. Will definitely come back if I visit Vegas next time.",

Without it, we would never have known of this gem hidden in a little shopping center. We decided to go with one if the dinners for 2 (The Las Vegas) and honestly, we were blown away with the amount of food that was served. Numerous little side dishes typical of Korean dining, but....cream cheese wontons, miso soup, edamame, salad, rice or bibimbap, steamed broccoli with cheese fondue AND 4 plates of meat......for $46.00 ???????????? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? There are so many combinations or a la carte items to choose from and all very reasonable. Plus....if you \"check in\" on Yelp, you get an ice cream macaroon for free...omg! From the amount if food, to the mouth watering flavors, and fabulous service...this place MUST be on your 'go to' list for dinner. You will not be disappointed!!! We did go on a weekday around 5 pm and it was quiet. Not sure how crowded a weekend would be so might want to prepare & call ahead.",

The meats were tender and juicy, and the leftovers that we finished later that night tasted just as good, if not better.   The service was excellent. Our food came within a blink of an eye. And the dishes just kept coming and coming. They definitely waste no time on keeping things running, since this place gets super busy.",

    "text": "I came here with two friends and we were starving. We saw that they had Kobe beef from the window menu and was excited to order that. We went for the Premium Cut package (which included the Kobe beef) but we also tagged on another extra order.   The Premium Cut package features a lot of great dishes such as fresh shucked oysters, beef carpaccio in ponzu sauce, oven baked asparagus, and my personal favorite was the grilled shrimp fried rice in the clay pot (forgot the Korean name). The rice was so good that we ordered another one to share.   The Kobe beef was pricey but well worth it - it practically melted in your mouth when cooked to a medium rare.   The three dipping sauces they give you are nice (one was chili based, another had sesame oil and one was ponzu?) and complemented all the beef cuts really well. Overall it was an amazing BBQ from start to finish. Service was friendly and I will come here again when I'm in town.  PS: The reason why they have so many reviews is because you get a free dessert when you show them your Yelp review - however, I found the dessert to be below average (they are ice cream macarons and looked better than they taste) but that doesn't change how I feel about the awesome BBQ. Skip the dessert :)",

    "text": "I had high expectations due to yelp reviews, but wasn't impressed, as I've had better in Duluth, GA. We came in during a slow Friday afternoon and ordered individual items of assorted marinated meats of pork belly and galbi, and the bacon wrapped enoki (a new found love for enoki mushrooms). In my opinion, the meat portions were too small for the price you pay. I believe they were ranging $8-10 per plate with about 4-6 pieces of meats. The flavors were pretty decent, but the meat quality just wasn't there. The meat did not taste fresh, but rather like it's been a good few days (3-5) since it was fresh. The bacon wrapped enoki was delicious but was very hard to cook without everything falling apart because you have to rotate it to cook the bacon. We did end up getting rice, which is charged for (~$2 per bowl), unlike other kbbq places that provide them at no charge when requested. The banchan was meh, as I thought the options didn't complement the meal well. For desserts, my SO and I checked in on yelp for a free macaroon ice cream. We had green tea and mango. Both were decent, but we liked the mango better. In general, the macaroon seemed stale, but it was free so we can't complain.   Overall, I'd tell you to lower your expectations and you might just really really enjoy your meal!",

I went here with a large pack: my family and friends, and despite the big party, the waiters and waitresses were attentive, helpful, and kind.  The meat is savory and delicious and tastes perfectly fine even without the seasoning that they give you.  One slight con is that they do not give out rice and that you will have it pay for it separately, but it is a slight disadvantage when compared to the quality of food you will get.  I can definitely say that I am more than satisfied and will come back whenever I visit Vegas again!",

This place is good, really good. Yes, the food is delicious and the prices are beyond fair. But what makes this place so good is the service. Always quick, very attentive, very courteous and very helpful.  Bravo to the owner who understands that customer service is key the success of any business. Also, I am not Korean and I am usually one of a few Caucasians in the restaurant when I am here. It is usually filled with young Asians...which tells me it is authentic food and reasonably priced, assuming the younger generation doesn't yet have oodles of money to spend on dining out. You won't go wrong here...promise.",

It doesn't take a lot of money to get filled up so don't worry that's its not a all you can eat restaurant. My favorite is mixing the white rice with the egg custard and putting a little kimchi on top before I add my meat on yop. Also don't forget to check in so you get your free ice cream. The best flavor is vanilla. Trust me",

The prices were not ridiculous like many other all you can eat Korean BBQ are. The sides were good, the meats were tender but a little in the flavorless side. Clean establishment and good enough  service! We order the meat lover special! It had 5 kind of meats, salad, miso soup, rice and the spicy steam dumpling. In the other side we did enjoy dessert, good ice cream macaroon.",

When we follow the waiter walking to the table. He didn't let us sit down. We saw there are ppl chatting and standing right next to the table. But our waiter didn't say excuse me or anything. So I guess is that his boss?? And then the waiter just asked us to wait. And then he left. We were like standing middle of the restaurant don't know what the hack is going on... After a while, nobody is going to do anything for us. We asked the chatting ppl by ourselves if so we can sit. And then the order was fine. When the food come, the waitress needs to mix the food. And food jump out of the bowl right on my purse. I saw she saw it, but she did not say a word.. I am not sure how service here should be. I'm not quiet happy with it.  For the food, it is just so so. I guess because I had too many good food in LA. Here doesn't taste like Asian food for me at all. But if ppl love American Asian food. Then here is the right place. Probably not coming back here.",

I feel like its totally unethical, and defeats the purpose of yelp. Anyway, me and a bunch of my friends got the Meat Lovers option and it was really good--my favorite I believe was the Beef Toro and some of the marinated meats. Filet Mignon was a little tough prob. because of how its grilled. Lettuce salad wasn't that great, but I did enjoy the seaweed salad. And the dessert which was a ice cream macroon (mango flavored) was delicious--reminded me of the one's at Trader Joes which I do like. Main bad thing was the location--you have to drive to this location so it's not convenient unless you have a car. Overall, if your craving kkbbq in Vegas-check this place out.",

Would order every time: Unmarinaded Kalbi-so tender and fatty, almost melts in your mouth Beef Tongue-served with a lemon dipping sauce that really completes the dish  King Oyster Mushroom-I love mushrooms, so this was a must for me  Would order again: Marinated Kalbi-seasoned very well, beef is tender (I like the unmarinaded better just because you can the taste of their high quality beef isn't masked by the marinade) Pork Belly-fairly standard K BBQ pork belly  Would skip: Filet mignon: meat quality was just not that great Macaroni banchan: this one we didn't order, just came with a bunch of other side dishes, but it was a really nasty macaroni salad that tasted like it was slathered in butter",

I had to delete it because it was so unTrue about this place.  This place sucks balls. I'm not comparing it to LA at all. They charge for sesame oil and salt and salad? $4.75 for a steamed egg? You got to be kidding me. Plus they're portions are so small and expensive, I couldn't even get full! Oh and rice was $2 for a small bowl...  So literally each place of meat only has 6 small pieces for $9. So we pretty much ordered everything in the meat section and some bacon wrapped scallops snd salmon. Those were honestly okay.   We decided to try something new by getting cheese fondue with broccoli. BIG MISTAKE. It was literally Kraft single cheese with oil? It didn't even melt right over the fire and wouldn't even stick on the broccoli.   SERVICE? Okay they were attentive when it came to ordering... But when we tried to refill our bachan they never came of course . We tried refilling twice on radish and bean sprouts! They said yes and then never return with it!   Plus when we received our bill they didn't put our drinks on HH and we had to tell them. *eye rolls*   Overall, I regret coming here based off fake reviews. I should of when to Gyu-Kaku.  Don't waste your money here.",

The only downside is that it doesn't have any two tops, which I believe causes some extra wait time... Changing the table mix (if possible) might help both the customers and the restaurant.",

    "text": "This Korean barbecue spot is a good place to satisfy carniverous cravings, if you can find parking. On weekends their lot can get pretty busy but, the hunt for a parking spot is worth it once you start grilling. My favorite item is the spicy pork. Leave it on the grill to get it extra crispy. Those charred edges give it a wonderfully crunchy texture to go with a moderately spicy profile. The prime kalbi was my second favorite. I loved the sweetness of the marinade that paired nicely with the natural savoriness of the marbled meat. Other items tried included tender chunks of filet, four decent sized garlic shrimp, and assorted vegetables (corn, mushrooms, peppers, onions, zucchini, and more). Portions run a little small, so it's best to order two or three items per person.  With a clean, intimate, dark interior it's great for casual date nights or just hanging out with friends or family. Tables are spaced rather far apart giving all plenty of privacy.",

    "text": "Whenever I'm in a big enough city, I start craving Korean food.  The GF had heard from some other folks that we should go to Sura, which we had gone to a few weeks earlier.  Sura was fine, but not good/great.  I had flown into Vegas, and per a mutual agreement, had not made any special Valentine's Day plans.  We ended up here for dinner, and there were probably 3 or 4 open tables.  We were quickly seated in the modern looking space.  The menu was interesting - they had the standard combo items, where you get a mix of meat and sides, but apparently when we were there it was happy hour, and they had items that were priced in the $3 to $8 so that you'd order a serving of beef toro, spicy pork, sides, etc  - almost felt like a tapas place, though obviously meat heavy.  Quality of the meat seemed a little better than Sura.  We were a little surprised that the kalbi/short-ribs had the bones removed, but that was fine.  All the meat and sides we had were good, and the gas grill worked fine.  I was also glad to see that they had spicy cucumber as a side, which is one of my favorite forms of kimchi.  The small plate style of ordering probably kept us from over-eating as much as an AYCE joint, but I was feeling nearly as full.  The one miss we had was that we had ordered white rice, but it didn't come out till we were almost done (which had included a second round of ordering).  I had asked about it earlier to one of the staff, and they nodded, and wandered away like they were on it, but didn't bring out any rice.  My guess is that they had gotten slammed at some point, and ran out of rice, so they had to make more, but that's only a guess.  No one said anything, and when they did bring out the rice near the end of the meal.  Overall, our damage with tip was an even $50, which was considerably less than the $72 we had spent at Sura, and I left feeling more satisfied with my meal.",

We had 5 meats.  All of them were good.  The Bulgogi was a little too salty, but still decent.  The only downside was that they didn't change our grill.  Overall though, considering the cost, the quality of meat, and the amount of food you get, this is a solid recommendation if you are looking for korean bbq in Vegas.",

But that was okay because my party had an entire back room to ourselves.  The service was stellar, and i'm sure most readers understand the premise of the place. You get a lot of pre-marinated meats/veggies/etc brought out to you and you cook it yourself on the mini-grill. It's so easy a 7 year old could do it (or my older brother who hardly gets credit for cracking an egg).  I recommend you get one of the pre-designed samplers. We opted for The paradise A  and we got more than enough food for two.  The Harami Miso, prime kalbi, and calimari were all yummy.  I would recommend this to anyone who is staying in Las Vegas. It is located right across the street from the Hard Rock Casino, but worth the cab ride if you are staying on the strip and to lazy to walk.",

    "text": "tl;dr--Recommended, though maybe without the full throated cheering from some of our fellow Yelpers.  We stopped by while working out way down the Strip due to the high praise from fellow Yelpers. On Christmas Eve, they weren't offering their usual (less expensive lunch menu) but hats off to the hardworking crew for working over the holidays. It's a mile or so east of Planet Hollywood so plan to drive or Lyft over unless you need the exercise.  The restaurant was basically full at 2:30 in the afternoon, which we took as a good omen. The banchan (free appetizers) came out even before we ordered and included a macaroni salad alongside the more typical kim chi, pickled spiced cucumbers, bean sprout salad, pickled radish and fish cake. The bean sprouts could have used a touch more seasoning but were otherwise fine.  The meats were well seasoned, so much so that we didn't much miss the traditional dipping sauces. We ordered a bibimbop that came in the traditional stone bowl but was not hot enough rice to crisp the rice. The bulgogi that came with the bibimbop was excellent but the only other sides were hints of red peppers and onions: order only as a side to accompany your BBQ and not as a meal.  The grill and exhaust hood were carefully maintained: gleaming metal shiny clean. Bathrooms were clean as well.  Service is typical for Asian restaurants: workmanlike but not particularly friendly. A bit slow but chalk that up to the steady stream of diners.  The kids gave it a 4 so we will round up from 3 or 3.5.  Disclosure: we were offered a free dessert for this review. Ice cream macaroons were delicious!",

    "text": "A really cool, modern, comfortable BBQ Place!  I would give this place a 5 star, if their banchan selection was more extensive.  However, for the location, the food and the service, I will definitely be coming to this place, again and again...  A.  Location - Harmon, Swenson, Paradise.  There is a small strip mall there that has plenty of food choices and this location is perfect for so many.  Right across from Hard Rock....  B.  The Service - extremely efficient and pleasant. I came here for lunch and while it was not terribly busy, the server was just right in being very efficient, always there when you wanted her, very nice and top notch.  C.  The Menu - Loved the menu.  The cuts here are smaller in size and also more reasonable in portion and pricing. You can order a huge variety of different meats, seafood and veggies all ranging in prices form 3.00 to 12.00 per plate.  I loved the mix and match. IF I brought my glasses and had more time, I would have done this.  Instead, I turned over the menu to the combo page and pre-ordered one of the combos to make it easier for me.  D.  The Food-   a.  Miso Soup - OK, so we are in a Korean restaurant and they serve Miso soup. I find that odd, and at same time I really cannot complain since it was tasty.  However, when I am eating BBQ, I like the real basic soup that is plain and simple.  b.  The meats -   Chicken Tender Cheese Fondue -   OK, I am not a huge non traditional foodie, but man, this was really cool and tasty.  Bulgogi - Wow was that really fast and the sauce was PERFECT.  Filet Mignon - So tender and juicy...  Shrimp Garlic - Would have preferred Shrimp PRAWN, but these tiny morsels were okay.  Harami Miso - Man was this steak just right. Never had it before and I really enjoyed it.  Assorted Veggies - Cool. Normal stuff. but those corn on the cob were awesome.  c.The appetizers - Again, miso soup, rice, salad and some kind of cream cheese wonton thing.  Different, okay. I prefer banchan.  E.  Come back factor - This is one cool place, the food is good, the portions are manageable so you can try different things for sure.  For business lunch, hanging out, this is a really nice restaurant and I do plan to come back.  If I am focused only on the bbq, I may try Tofu Hut or other places DJK, but I really enjoyed this Gangnam BBQ.  GK says, check it out.",

The servers don't really check up on your table so you have to go chasing for the servers to get what you want. Also, when I ordered the fried calamari, you can't really taste or feel the calamari inside. It's more of batter than the squid itself. Lastly, I'm more on the shorter side, so the chairs were kind of too far so I kept having to move forward to reach the table. Since the service we received was not good, we did not leave a tip so while we were waiting for our uber, one of the servers, came outside and asked if service was bad, and we responded by saying \"it was alright\" and he was like \"I was just asking because you guys didn't leave a tip\". How rude of him to chase us for a tip when service was bad. NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN.",

I had often seen the characters eating this and I had not had it in probably 10 years...so after looking at the positive reviews I thought it best to give it a go. They set you up with a package of you desire, some have premium meats (juicer more expensive cuts I.e filet mignon) and others have a mix of regular cuts and maybe one premium meat. We chose the latter. Boy was it delicious. The meats were well seasoned and the grill was hot and cooked the meats quickly. The ponchon (the sides...forgive me if I spelled it wrong) were all excellent. I loved the dried squid in particular and the seaweed salad.  I ate my full but felt healthy afterwards and for Checking In they gave us a free macaroon ice cream sandwich...and they were delicious! When I go back to Vegas I am heading straight there.",

We mentioned it twice but wasn't sure if it was part of our order, so we didn't make a big deal .  Over all it was a great dinner and good food .  Next time we will Definitely pay more attention to the menu  and  what we order , sucks to pay for something and not enjoy it.",

You are gonna need the strength.  We timed our visit for the happy hour specials and spent a nice afternoon sampling so many tasty dishes.  It was not crowded at all at 3pm on a Saturday.

    "text": "I happen to be in vegas for a very large convention, and part of the enjoyment in my job is traveling city to city and trying the different restaurants available near my hotel.  After a very long day of setting up a new show I was starving!  I head back to my hotel at the Las Vegas Westgate, and first things first, I really needed to get out of my work clothes shower and just chill for a minute.  My co worker and myself ar both sitting in our hotel room, catching the end of the sunday night football game, smoking marijuana, and discussing what we want to eat.  We decide we are both craving asian (both food and women) and come accross Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining as a close and affordable option not too far from our hotel.  My co- worker and I are still just smoking weed and now were wrapped up in the NFL game (the giants were playing the niners and I have Carlos Hyde on my fantasy team and he got a late TD to make my lead pretty solid heading into MNF) and now its getting late.  We check the hours and are both pleased to see that Gangnam is open untill 1 am, and to top it off they have a late night happy hour starting at 10 pm.  \"This is perfect!\" Chris, My co-worker, says.  He continues, \"We have time to smoke more pot, sit down and just be high for 5 minutes then realize we have to get going.\"  I thought to myself, \"yes this is perfect by the time we get there the munchies should be fully kicking in, and I will have a nice hearty appetite for my meal.\"  Chris and I show up, looking fresh in our Hawaiian shirts ready to eat.  Our waitress sits us down and immediately recognizes our sweet shirts and asks us if we are from Hawaii.  We tell her \"no\" although chris is a quarter Hawaiian but we explain to her we are from California and are just visiting for the week.  She then explains to us that she is hawaiian and she just returned from visitng just a couple days prior. Anyways, conversation ensued, our waitress (she was like a solid 7) points out to us some of here favorite things on the menu.  I procede to order appetizers of their Calimari and the spicy tuna Kimbap.  Remember we are now incredibly stoned and I think this would of tasted great sober.  This tuna kimbap appetizer was absolutely fantastic, I highly reccomend!  So now we move on to the entrees.  I order the bacon wrapped scollaps, the Korean Chicken Fondue, and the Prime Kalbi.  My co-worker had also order the the Korean chicken and the kalbi, but his for his third dish he ordered the Harami Miso. Now I loved all tree things I ordered.  I enjoyed the mix i made myself with one beef dish, 1 chicken dish, and 1 seafood dish.  The chicken cheese fondue stood out as my favorite, while chris pointed to the Harami Miso as his favorite.  My only somewhat negative comment would be that the Prime Kalbi cuts I recieved seem to be a little to fatty for my liking making the meat really chewy. We washed our meals down with a pitcher of kirin.  Now after we finished with our meat cuts, it was time to move on to dessert.  I got the cofee flavored Ice cream sandwhich thing, and it was very tasty and was a nice cold snack to end the meal on.    After dinner chris and I went back to our room to smoke more marijuana and stream Archer on netflix.  TL;DR: Got way too high off gravity bong rips in my hotel. Headed to gangnam and ate a lot of korean bbq. Got a free dessert for writing a review on yelp.",

Spicy garlic edamame was also good. Our favorite proteins were Harami Miso and Korean Prime Kalbi. Calamari garlic was just ok, not very garlicky.  Broccoli was good, but the cheese fondue was hopelessly separated(tasty though).  To finish it off the Banana tempura was fantastic, choose the green tea ice cream with it. Probably our favorite dessert of our vacation , and it was free for writing this review at the table. The meal came with several welcome extra tastes like Kim chee, sprouted beans etc. We would love to return.",

It seems pricey at first but the amount of food you get (not monster proportions but a variety of food) and the dining experience is unforgettable. The place was packed when we walked in Saturday night, but we didn't wait long. 10 minutes max. Our waitress' answered so many questions with a smile on their faces  (real ones). They explained dishes to us when we blanked stared them at options we had no clue we had. Multiple people checked on us to make sure we were chugging along okay, but not in an annoying way. Like kind table clearing ninjas on a mission. It wasn't overwhelming at all. The food all came out very quickly and it was SOOOOO.GOOD. I was nervous about cooking our own meat but it was sliced in such manageable pieces once we got started it was like we were pros. We had the Gangnam for two and we ate everything... Except the fish cakes. They had good flavor but I'm allergic. I would love to go again with friends. I know it would be so much fun, and more kind on the wallet.

Free Korean tradition appetizers are just ok, poke salads are very salty,  Beef capaccio is sliced so thin and soaking in pot of salt and sauce, totally lost meaning of Korean authentic so fresh to eat them raw capaccio.  I would give one star to bibimbap.  Service is just ok, they want come by table to check and cook for you.  Everything is too salty and quality is close to 25 dollars AYCE but with much less quantity. I would not recommend to anyone else. I would strongly recommend Kobe beef combo from other KBB place called \"Gong\".",

    "text": "Fresh and feast are the precise words to describe them. I came with my boyfriend and his sister when we arrived at Las Vegas and was starving after a 7-hours driving and stuck in traffic jam. It took us about 20 minutes wait but I think we got lucky. Because right after we had a table, the restaurant filled quickly with people inside and outside. For 3 Asian people, we ordered the Gangnam set for 2 people, plus a side order of Prime Kalbi, egg pot, and salad.  - The portion is huge that we should have only ordered the set without any extra. - The meat is fresh and well-seasoned - The egg pot is not so good because it is so dense and plain.  - The surprise is we have to pay extra for the salad! Please excuse me if you're annoyed at this comment. I've been to several Korean BBQ places which don't charge extra for veggie.  - The atmosphere and the service are family-friendly.  - Honestly, I thought of a 4.5 stars because of the egg pot and extra charge. But boom, if you checked in on Yelp, you get a free Macaroon Ice-cream :) That's my weakness point as an ice-cream addict.  Overall, we had a good experience and might come back again for the other dishes ^.^",

The service, the food, the quality, and the quantity all surpassed our expectations.   It's in a plaza and parking can be a bit tight and narrow but not too bad. The place itself feels pretty open and roomy with a dark and a bit of a modern but also traditional ambience.   Coming in, they greeted us right away and got us seated after a decent wait. We also came in during happy hour so there were some nice discounts! There were a good amount of side dishes, and the refills were super generous! My dad had the kimchi tofu soup (requested to be as spicy as possible), my brother had the bibimbap, and my mom, other brother, and I had Korean BBQ (beef brisket and pork belly). Everything was delicious!! Nothing too overpowering or too bland. Everything was just right to our liking. It's hard to get my entire family to enjoy the same place together because we have different tastes, but this place satisfied us all.   The service also added to our great experience here. The servers are all very attentive, friendly, funny, and super helpful. We will definitely be coming back and highly recommend anyone to give this place a try if you're craving Korean food/BBQ.",

When you walk in you are immediately greeted by a warm smile by all the friendly staff, that is a sign to a good experience from the start. The place is limited to some seating and I can tell it can get very busy with long wait times but it's totally worth it. I sat at the bar and ordered their Spicy Garlic Edamame, another dish that came prepared with thin slices of raw meat In a delicious sauce and 2 bottles of Soju. Everything tasted wonderful and the service was nothing short of amazing. The setting is low lit to create a romantic and calming mood and it just tied in beautifully with my whole first time experience there. Overall, it's a must visit if you want to try an Asian BBQ place, I know next time I will get a table and start cooking to get the full experience but for now, this place is worth every penny and every second of your time. Can't wait to come back!",

The massive menu has preset meals and a la carte options to get your meat on, along with various apps and sides.    We shared the Las Vegas package for two (wonton, edamame, salad, soup, and bibimbap with Korean chicken, spicy chicken, beef toro, shrimp garlic, and broccoli cheese fondue, $45), and added on the flat iron garlic- meal came with the usual banchan and was more than enough for two of us. I didn't have room for dessert and took an entire meal worth of food home. Favorites were the toro, shrimp, and filet, but the bulgogi bibimbap was really great too. Their sides are surprisingly well done, this is not a spot that focuses on the meats and forgets the rest.   Staff were attentive and frequently checked on us. Location looks tiny from the outside but inside was spacious and tables are huge. I appreciate that they changed out our grill without needing to ask. Good spot for group meals!  TIP: check in on Yelp for a free macaron ice cream cookie sandwich for dessert!",

The food was pretty good, hence the 3 stars and rounding up, but the service was non-existent.  I probably should have read more reviews prior to going here.  A smile and \"you're welcome\" goes a long way, and even dropping off the bill and not saying anything is esp rude.  If I had known service was a huge opportunity, I probably never would have taken friends from out of town here.   A mistake that's easily fixed.    There are tons of better K BBQ here in Vegas with way better service that will get our business going forward.  Management/owners- retrain your current staff or make some tough decisions.  But lack of basic and good service will harm your business long term.",

We were seated promptly and our waiter was happy to explain how Korean BBQ to us. We went A la Carte. The portions of the various meats, seafood, and vegetables were quite good. The seafood was fresh, and the grills worked well, not too hot, but just enough to cook things perfectly. The  honey bread, which comes with multiple scoops of ice cream was a giant of a dessert. I'll be back on future trips in town",

    "text": "Lets start with the NOT SO GREAT.  Our server was terrible.  We came around 1pm for a late lunch, and the restaurant was full, so he asked us to have a seat in the waiting area.  It was a short wait, and about 2 minutes go by.  We hear someone yelling from across the restaurant to us, telling us to please be seated.  It was the original person that told us to have a seat in the waiting area......and he motioned his arm, with his palm up, towards the open table that had just been cleaned and set for 2.  I thought this was really rude that he couldn't even walk over (about 7 steps) and actually bring us over to our table.  We order, and my eyes are always bigger than my stomach, and he starts to tell me I have quite a bit of food, and that I can always order more if needed.  Nice of him to do that, since I don't know how big the portions are.  Our side dishes come out, then the uncooked meat comes out.  We start grilling, but he doesn't bring us anything else -- no rice, no salad, no appetizers.  Finally someone else brings the salad and our order of Jap Chae but no rice.  I'm a a Chinese dude that needs my rice, so to sit there with cooked meat that is getting cold is starting to add to my frustration with their lack of service (or common sense).  We get our rice, and then we have to remind them that they still have not brought our iced water.  So someone runs back there and gets our water and and appetizer and puts it down on the table.  We finally have everything we are supposed to get, and can now eat, but now, I'm really annoyed at how terrible the service has been.  In addition, the table next to me had to constantly ask the wait staff for stuff, as if they were brand new waiters or something.   I mean simple stuff like refill waters, bring extra napkins if the existing ones are completely dirty, etc.  Its not rocket science.  But about 5-6 times during lunch the next table had to ask for this simple stuff.    Food:  Everything we ordered was really good.  In fact if service was half decent I would have even said the food was fantastic, but its really hard to enjoy a meal if you are pissed off at how shitty the service was.  One mistake is ok.....2 is forgivable, but it was like they were PURPOSELY trying to do a shitty job.    We ordered the lunch special which came with white rice and either 1 or  2 Proteins -- we chose the Spicy Pork and Bulgogi.  Both were good. I did the Jap Chae and 2 \"a la carte\" proteins -- Kobe Style and Korean Prime Kalbi (marinated).  Kobe was SUPER tender and just a great piece of meat.  Prime Kalbi was also a hit.  Sides were great, especially the pickled cucumbers and fish cake.     After we finished our lunch, we realized that NO ONE had even checked up on us once during the entire meal.  Yes, they came to drop off new plates and take away empty ones, but not once did anyone say \"How is everything going?\" or \"Do you need anything else?\"  In fact, the only thing that was ever said to me was \"Are you all done grilling?  If yes, I can turn off the grill.\"  I actually wanted to say \"Everything was great, thanks for asking\" just to be a smart ass, but I decided against it.  And then the next question was \"Are you ready for your tab?\"  I mean the waiter seriously didn't even offer us dessert, or anything else for that matter.  It brought me right back to being annoyed again, and I even debated not tipping them anything, but being a former restaurant worker, I always leave money because I know that a big portion of their pay comes from tips.  But geez man, it felt like you were intentionally working really hard to be this shitty, and it sure didnt feel like you deserved a tip, but you got one anyway.  In the end , the food is great, but just come with the expectation that your service will be somewhere between TERRIBLE and NON-EXISTENT and you will enjoy yourselves.  5 stars for the food and 2 stars for the service, so that's a total of 7.  Divide by 2 and you get 3.5.  I rounded up to 4.  You have been warned.....",

There's was a lot of food. The bulgogi was delicious because it was in a stone pot so the rice was pretty crunchy and crispy. I liked everything except for the dubokki, it was a little too sweet. Service was good and portion was generous. Price was pretty decent. We got the macaron ice cream through Yelp check in and it was just ok, nothing special. Overall, it was a very good meal and would come back",

Didn't order rice cuz it was extra and didn't really end up needing it anyways. We kinda wished there was free salad to balance all the meats. Great service and great food. Would go back!",

You have got to be kidding me.. that is a lot of reviews, so of course.. we HAD to try it and let me tell you, it was not a disappointment.   We got there around 7:10pm and there was a little wait.. maybe 20 or so minutes. Not too bad because they were filled.   We ordered the Gangnam special but added spicy garlic fatty meat, japche, and bulgogi fried rice. We ordered calamari and fried dumplings for appetizers too. The food is absolutely delicious, but my only itty bitty complaint is the calamari was kind of bland... but everything else was soooo good!! All of the meats were flavorful and extremely tender. Everything was just on point and the service was great too. On yelp, there was also an option to get a free macaron ice cream with checking in and we were able to get 3 of them. We tried mango, coffee, and green tea. The coffee is the best in my opinion... real coffee flavors, so good!  You will not be disappointed! I want to come here again when I come back in August",

Our server stopped by once just as we were finishing to drop off our bill and turned the burner on high rather than off... luckily another server noticed within a minute or two.

We are used to thin and crispy.  Veggie potstickers are more like dim sum dumplings.  Japchae noodles were a tad undercooked.

Instead of ordering a set meal, we picked-and-chose about 11 dishes to share: 1 seafood salad - 5 stars (it has papaya it in); 3 marinated premium beef - 5 stars; 1 spicy chicken with lemon dipping sauce - 3 stars; 2 pork belly - 4 stars; 1 steamed corn - 5 stars; 1 bacon wrapped asparagus - 4 stars; 2 unmarinated premium beef - 4 stars; 2 big bowls of white rice. 1 large bottle of hi-te (beer) and 1 bottle of sake. Our order came with side dishes at no additional cost (kim chi, pickled cucumber, fish cake, etc...). One thing we didn't order that I wish we did, was the glass noodles (japchae).   You grill all the meat/veggies yourself. Be sure to ask them to change the grill tray (they didn't offer for us). The Yelp check-in deal gave us a free macaron ice cream sandwich (from Brick) - I chose the green tea flavor and it was delicious! The macaron was light, not too sweet, with nice texture (soft/lightly chewy, but not hard). My verdict: go here for a delicious & filling meal off the strip (but it's not too far)!",

The meat all tasted the same except the galbi. Overall, the meat was all a bit tough to eat. Definitely did not have the other experience people had. The meats all came out really oily and fatty. It might be that they just didn't have a good batch of meat or it might be that I've been spoiled by kbbq and jbbq in socal.   The service was okay.   The portion with the set was pretty big. Even though we got the set for 2, it could have easily fed 3 or 4 people.   The free macaron ice cream was the only highlight to my dinner.",

You can ask for refills if you run out. They have excellent deals on drinks during happy hours ( I think it's half of tap beers and house sake). Service is on the slow side, but it's ok. We were busy eating anyways. If you go with a large group, order from the group menu. We had 9 people and we ordered dinner for 6. it was more than enough. The fluffy egg bowl was very good too (i don't remember what it was called). It's located right across the street from Hard Rock Hotel. Check it out. You won't be disappointed.",

We got there right before 6:30pm and were seated fairly quickly. It's inside a shopping center that is a little difficult to see from the road. They had K pop playing on one of the walls from the projector which is always fun to watch. Service was good and very attentive.  The only thing that sucks is some of the items that usually come as part of the BBQ is charged a la carte here - like the sea salt and sesame oil dip. They charge $1 a pop for it. Not expensive but a little annoying. The drinks here were all really good and SO REFRESHING. I swear, they've made the best lychee martinis I've ever had and I wish I had their recipe. It was that good!  Down to the food - nearly all of it was nothing short of amazing. We ordered the Meat Lover's BBQ for 4 which was $99. Not a bad price for all you get. The meats were all flavorful and marinaded well. The pork belly was the only thing that could have been better - it was not as thick as some of the other places I've been. I also ordered the seafood soft tofu soup which was good but not the greatest. I still enjoyed it.   I'm in Vegas about once a year and when I come back, I'm definitely going back!",

    "text": "I was craving for some good Korean food while up in Vegas.  Thankfully through Yelp I was able to find Gangnam Asian BBQ which wasn't too far from our hotel by cab ride.  The place is located in a mall looking area next to a 24 hr nail salon.  I remember this because I was amazed that they had such thing as a 24 hr nail salon.  We came around 11 at night, a pretty late dinner for us.  But we're in Vegas so thankfully there are lots of late night places to eat.  The good thing about arriving here late is that we made it to the late night happy hour.  I definitely recommend ordering from the happy hour menu!  We literally almost ordered everything from it plus a tofu soup that wasn't on their happy hour menu.  I thought it wasn't going to be enough food but boy was I wrong.  It was too much food! Although my bf can eat a lot, we still had leftovers.  All the meats were good!  Also recommend the cheese wontons. We got 2 orders of those cause my bf liked it so much.  The tofu soup had big chunks of tofu sticking out from the soup and was filled with lots of kimchee and meat inside.  They also give a variety of ban chan.  All so yummy!  I was pleasantly surprised by this place and was even happier with the price.  I would compare this place to being like Gyu-kaku but better!  Service was good, fast and food was great.  No complaints here!",

We came here on a Sunday night on Memorial Day weekend around 8pm and waited exactly 45mins. That's not bad at all for a holiday weekend.. Not to mention their cool projector that plays music videos to pass time.   Now onto the food, we went with the Gangnam combo, and little FYI, if you want to substitute something, as long as it's equal or lesser price.. YOU CAN!! We substituted our bulgogi for beef toro & yuzu for cream cheese wontons.   Now onto the FOOD! I've been to many Kbbq and AYCE kbbq, I have to say,this place is pretty up there on my kbbq list! The meat quality here is very good, tender and tasty. I also like that it's NOT AYCE, the portions were more than enough and I was able to really enjoy the meats instead of stuff my face cause it's AYCE lol.   As for service, everyone here moves fast! If I didn't live in CA, I'd definitely be back!   *tip: write a review and get a free dessert! Win win for everyone!",

It was such a good decision to come here as we were just in time for happy hour! Happy hour on a Sunday (bomb!!!) after a long night out = pure happiness!!!!! The servers were friendly, food was delicious. Everything is small plates only, similar to Gyu Kaku.  We tried pretty much everything from the HH menu, the spicy pork & beef toro & pork belly were our favorites for the meats. Steamed dumplings, seaweed salad were also good too. This place is definitely worth the try if you don't want AYCE bbq. Can't wait to come back again if I'm in the area!",

Open late and they are very happy to help you if you haven't gone to Korean barbecue are not very good at doing the cooking aspect of it. They also have different entrees available such as noodles and other stuff like that but they also have group options if you want to get a lot of different stuff for people all at the same time, especially if you have a larger party and don't want everyone to order 20 of the same thing.

For the last option C, you get to choose from all of other option A-C. Plus it come with appetizers, two soups and rice. Fairly priced for all of the options you can choose from.

Yob never checked on us if we still have drinks or bussed our table coz it's getting over crowded with empty dishes . Then when we left it was a different person who gave us our bill .

I really appreciate that the waiters don't push you to order more because it would be wasteful if we couldn't finish everything. The waiters and waitress were all very accommodating and super nice. It's definitely a place that you can take your date to. The meats were super delicious and nice quality. The check in ice cream macaron was a great wrap for the end of our meal!",

My wife and I ordered two appetizers (cream cheese triangles, mushroom medley), and four mains (pork, bulgogi, 2 beef), and a side of rice.  This was more than enough food!  The only item we didn't care for was the pork belly, everything else was very good.  Oh, they also give you 5-7 mini-starters (kimchi, cucumbers, fishcakes, etc.), which were very nice (we would have ordered slightly less had we known!).",

After we were seated, appetizers and food came out pretty quick and service was good. The spicy tuna kimbap was really yummy, with crunchy rice rolls underneath the spicy tuna.   The meat was very fresh and well seasoned too, just need to make sure you watch the meat so it doesn't burn.  Only downside with Korean bbq is you always end up smelling like the bbq lol. But the food here was great! Probably try to come earlier to avoid the long wait though.",

Kalbi Prime Beef and Kobe Style Beef was fabulous.  Pork belly was good.  Portion sizes are large for the chicken salad and bibimbap.  Definitely to share.  Parking is easy in the lot.   A great place to get your fix on Asian food.  Nice atmosphere.",

The wait was a little longer than we were told, but the food was delicious and so reasonably priced. Bulgogi was great, but I found the flat iron garlic a bit chewy. The best thing was their Kalbi soup! I love this soup and thought that this place did it incredibly well- flavorful, tender meat, good noodles, and huge portion. Also ordered the prawns and brisket, these were good. Friendly staff and waiter.",

My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this little off the strip hidden gem when we went to try and go off the strip to get an ear piercing. We didn't get the piercing, but we ended up eating a fantastic dinner.  We got there just in time for happy hour so we definitely had to take advantage of this sweet deal. We ordered the Chicken Karaage, Steamed Chili Dumplings, and then the Spicy Pork, Beef Toro, Pork Belly and Bulgogi for the BBQ aspect of it. Since it was so cheap, we ended up ordering about 3 or 4 of each of the meat items.  They also had beers on happy hour too, so we took advantage of those as well. We got a pitcher of beer and a bottled soju. I mean, we were at a Korean restaurant so we had to go with the soju.  The service here is wonderful and the food was awesome. Whenever I am back in Vegas I will be coming here!",

Overall great experience here, bit on the more pricey side since we got the combo for $100 because usually AYCE would be $25/person as well. Maybe next time would only get the combo for 2 people instead of 4 because we couldn't finish but was able to get some to-go! Also great customer service and would return again!

    "text": "If only South Florida had amazing Korean BBQ places like this one!! Gangnam Asian BBQ is located a bit off the strip but it's definitely worth visiting. This low-key restaurant has a great menu of assorted meats and also, there's plenty of Happy Hour deals on drinks as well as food. All the prices are very reasonable. It is clean, neat and well ventilated inside so you don't leave smelling like smoky BBQ. The service is good, they are attentive and can answer any questions you have.They have a tv on playing the latest Kpop hits as well as other genres of music.   If this is your first time doing Korean BBQ, keep in mind, you have to cook the meat yourself. If the grill is getting too charred and sticky, you can ask them to change out the hot plate. Aside from meat dishes, there are plenty of vegetable platters you can order. I recommend trying a stew too. For food, I ordered beef toro, kalbi, bulgogi, pork belly and kabocha squash. The marinated kalbi was my favorite but the beef toro was the most unique. Nice fatty thin slices with delicious marbling. I loved their dipping sauces too. Nice generous portions of the side dishes as well. Check in on Yelp to receive a free dessert - maracon ice cream! Very sweet and a large portion too! If only I lived closer....",

Good selection of meats, everything we had was good. The meat lovers combo is the way to go, all the good stuff. Each of the meat portions aren't that big themselves, but the full combo is good size. So if you are ordering individually, make sure to get a few. If you check in on yelp you get a little ice cream thing. We didn't have a long wait, but it was a week night.",

I order the mushroom and asparagus but they are all ready to eat and they are cooked directly over fire. I would like to cook them by myself. Still it is a very nice place to visit. If you are not seeking for high-end dining experience on Strip yet still want some place better than Panda Express with reasonable price, this is the place you should visit.",

My favourite dish was the Bulgogi sliced ribeye and I really enjoyed the fishtail complimentary side. The rest were not anything special but I liked that they were unlimited. When we went, they were offering free dessert in exchange for a Yelp! review so it would have been rude not to. You get to choose between a free plate of banana tempura with ice cream or a macaron ice cream sandwich (only coffee flavour was left and I'm glad we never paid for it).",

    "text": "We were looking forward to some great grilled korean beef. We tried the wagyu similar to Kobe beef. It was tasty but very small quantity for 24.95.  Not worth it. We've had real Kobe in Japan and Waygu here in the USA.   They need to increase the amount for the price. The weight must have been about 4 oz.    also with the fatty rib beef and kobi style beef not leaf lettuce served we had to ask for garlic to roast.  I believe they'll give you what you ask for but you must ask.  While I'm writing this they just brought out another serving of kobi style beef. No charge.  They're working the issue.  We will return.   And we do recommend.  We had the uni with kobi appetizer it was a treat.  The kimchi is excellent. The other side dishes are as well. Great traditional or classic korean.",

We came with a group of 5 and didn't expect that it would be an automatic 18% tip on the check. Most places it's 6 people or more. So I guess that's something to be cautious of, especially if you're not looking carefully and could double-tip.",

My friend helped me to pick out my food. I am not an adventurous eater. I ordered the filet mignon & bacon wrapped asparagus. There are 4 different appetizers that you can sample with your meal while it cooks. I compare that to standard bread served at traditional American restaurants. One was like celery in a red sauce,  another was clear noodles and I really liked that one, another one I wasn't sure of, and the last one was kimchee. It was a fun experience. They give you three sauces to dip your meat into once it is cooked. If you check in on Yelp, you get a free ice cream macaroon for dessert! That was really nice and the perfect way to end the meal. I will definitely be back to try new food next time. This is in a little plaza near UNLV. It's not easy to find. Our waiter was very helpful in explaining the set up to me.",

The combination of sweet meats with enoki mushrooms coupled with a sweet onion and perfectly steamed rice keeps me coming back time and time again.   When you've had enough of the overpriced food from the overhyped restaurants on the strip, hop over to gangnam for a great meal the whole family will enjoy at a price that will keep you at the poker table a little longer.",

The restaurant is always clean and staff is friendly. I've had the other items on the menu before and they are on the pricy side but good. My bill during happy hour or getting the $49 meal for two is usually  the same as an all you can eat with a little bit less but higher quality food.",

They have music videos playing on a giant screen, but not to loudly, to give a slight party feel without intruding into your dinner conversation.    The menu is a la carte but the food quality is extraordinary. I've been to many KBBQs in Vegas, and this is by far my favorite. I've been here maybe 4-5 times.   Their spicy tuna appetizer is really good. The beef carpaccio is average, I ordered it once and never again.   The skirt steak, galbi, toro, bulgogi and filet are all excellent. Their beef tongue is the best in Vegas. The chicken here is okay, but I always get the chicken cheese fondue because I love cheese.  Overall, a great ambience, location, never any wait and great food quality. I will be back!",

Our server was a fantastic host, to boot.  If you are staying at Hard Rock, it is just across the street (that's where we are staying).

We were drawn to this restaurant because of all of the positive reviews on Yelp.  I was surprised by the volume of reviews for such a small restaurant.  Because of this, I had high expectations for my meal and was extremely  disappointed.  The food was terrible and low quality.  Luckily, the food was so bad we only ate a small portion of the meal.  Yes, we were lucky because we returned home to stomach pains. So how does the restaurant get so many good reviews? Each table has a sign that says you will get a free desert if you show your Yelp review to a server.  No, I did not get a free desert for writing this.  If the quality of their desserts matches the quality of the meal, I have no interest in trying anything else from the menu.   I am writing this review from the comfort of my own home where I am recovering from my dinner and wishing that I had spent my money elsewhere.",

    "text": "Wow what a hidden gem. Do yourself a favor and get off the strip for some really good food. Do not mistake this place for one of those cheap all you can eat Korean buffets. This place has set menus based on number of people or a la carte if you want to make your own combination. The must have appetizer is Uni and pork belly. It's low carb, fatty and creamy. All kinds of yummy goodness. Seriously. One order has two wraps so order accordingly.  The meat is such good quality. Trimmed and perfectly marbled. You can choose marinated or natural. I recommend natural since the quality of meat was excellent it doesn't need much. This is how you know the place is good when you grill the meat simply and dip it in a bit of sesame oil, salt and pepper.  This is now my new must go to place when I come to Vegas. One of the best Korean restaurants in Nevada and I highly recommend it.",

I called for reservation for 03.21.16 (Monday) but the lady who answered said \"is your party more than 8 people?\" I said \"no 5.  I wanted to make reservations for tonight at 10\". She was like \"oh no reservation. Just walk in\"  That was weird. Are you not able to make reservations for under 8 people or what??  Any who I got there at 10pm and there was a 30 minute wait. We were able to sit down around 1040ish and by that time the restaurant was half empty.    TIP:  make sure you talk to a competent hostess who is able to make reservations because I've read the reviews and you're able to.  Or else go after 11pm so there's no wait.  - Kobe style beef - prime kalbi - flat iron garlic - premium tongue - pork toro  All of the meat was very very good and tender.  I recommend them all!",

They were accommodating which made our party very happy.   We ordered and tried all the dishes on the happy hour. The beef Toro and pork belly were one of our favourite.  The fondue cheese was interesting to dip the meat in.   I liked how we each had our own individual sauces, 3 different type.  One was like a pretty ponzu, one was like a teriyaki, and another a spicy teriyaki.   We tried the premium prime Kalbi and it was really tender.  We had to order another plate so we could each get another bite.   The waiters are friendly and always around to take orders.   And best of all, for being a great yelper and doing a review, we got a free macaron.",

We were stoked to find a KBBQ so close to the strip! Got there around 11pm as they close around 1am. The restaurant was pretty empty. We were seated quickly and told it was happy hour! Score! Here's what we ordered:   - fried calamari, 2/5 - chicken karaage, 4/5 - beef toro, 3/5 - pork belly, 3/5 - beef bulgogi, 3/5  Everything was mediocre. Nothing out of the ordinary and pricey for the size of the portions. We ended up ordering 3 orders of the beef toro! What really gave this place low stars was the service. They were nice and all but seriously nowhere to be found whenever we needed anything. Our orders took forever to come out and after the long drive, we just wanted to eat! Also, our grill was literally on fire until someone casually came out and changed it. Our server also made weird, awkward, borderline inappropriate jokes and just gave the whole experience a weird vibe.   Don't think I'll be back. So many other places to hit up that's ten times better!",

This means that no meat gets cold and hard cause you're chowing on something else. Also the smaller portions mean you can try different meats without committing to one type. Servers came by and checked on us often, great service.",

Our total cost was only about thirty five dollars for four people. In the end, we were all pretty full. Unfortunately here is no salad and rice is not include, but , can be purchased for extra cost. The Beef toro is really tender so we ordered two plates of it. I would also recommend all the chicken items. Not only that all of them were three dollars,but it was really juicy and tender. I was not disappointed with anything.  The grill does burn a bit but we only needed to change it once.  The side dishes were cake, spicy cucumbers, sweet suit, kimchi, pickled onions and macaroni cheese.  The service is really good. The waitresses were all really nice and kept checking on us.  The location is a bit far from where I live. It is tucked in with a Cvs and a hot dog place.",

The food was very delicious. We got the meat lovers for four. I also got the egg ramen noodles, but I wasn't too impressed with that. But everything else was quite tastey. The reason that I didn't give this place a five star rating is because once the food was on the table no one came by to check on us. We all needed refills on water and my husband needed another beer. Also, the check was brought before asking if we needed anything else which we were interested in dessert. This is a huge pet peeve of mine. We ordered the honey bread and it took 25 minutes to come out. That's way too long for toasted bread and ice cream in my opinion. However, it was delicious.",

If you never had it before it was just tempura fried sushi rolled topped with spicy tuna. We also had the fried calamari, I thought their tempura batter was one of the best I've had in a long time. We didn't pick any of their packages since there were some items we did not want. We had prime Kalbi (decent but I've had much better in KC and LA), pork belly, beef Toro, Tongue, and mushroom medley (this comes out cooked already for you). All in all the service was excellent, food was great but I think we had better in LA and Kansas City. I thought the best cut of meats was way better in Kansas City. Maybe the mid-west have better cuts of meat??? Since we got there after 10 PM it was happy hour so a lot of our items were priced lower than usual so that was a big plus. We both had all the food for about $40. For the price and great service,  I would still recommend this place and I would come back again soon.",

Where to start?  Staff was nice, only took about 7 1/2 minutes in between to refill my water from when it was empty and full. Ordered that $70 combo meal with a side of pork belly.  Sauces came out and dropped off with no description, but thank god for having taste buds I were able to figure out what each sauce was.  Meats came out before all the appetizers, and I guess raw oysters were to serve as my dessert? Lol.. The filet mignon did not go well with my raw oysters, as well as my super sweet and sauced up bibimbap. Teriyaki sauce galore I guess.  Meat quality was probably close to tofu hut which would of been nice if they had a $10 AYCE.  House salad was meh, soup was meh meh, everything meh. Granite the staff was nice and lagged on getting stuff for us, like water, dropped chopsticks, and napkins and all that. No biggie I'm asian, I'm use to eating with my hands.  I normally don't like to bash on businesses but I feel like this place has gotten way more love than they should. All the 4 or 5 star ratings might have come from drunks or people with no taste buds. Best of luck to this place, yelp you failed me.",

The fact that this place is off the strip makes it even better as most people who frequent it are avid fans of Korean cuisine rather than a bunch of tourists.",

I don't recommend the beef toro because the tough texture. However, the quality of the pork belly was pleasing since it had minimal fat in it. Also, fried calamari was wonderful! The sauce that came with the calamari was very delicious! Lastly, the daengjang jigae was tasty. TBH you can never go wrong with daengjang jigae lol   I would honestly give this rating a 3 star, but a particular waiter bumped it up to a 4 star. I definitely have to give a shoutout to Joseph! There was a waitress who seemed annoyed and very impatient with us from the start, but luckily, we had a change in service halfway through our meal. Joseph was nice and actually cared about the customers! Thanks again for your kind gestures! We really appreciated it! :)",

Every time I travel to LV, I come to this place. Happy hour rocks! 50% off! I had Bulgogi, Beef Toro, pork belly, and chicken karaage. The bacon wrapped asparagus is excellent too. It was accompanied by the kimchi apps. I also had a ginger soju cocktail for $3.75. Love it. They are very busy so be patient and kind, you'll get the best service.   Great place to have what your heart desires, Gangnam brings the best of Japanese soups, pork Toro, and sausages with Korean BBQ, bibimbap, and Chigae. If you don't know those words, you have to try it. Order 4 BBQ items and get the complimentary side dishes. Also, to complete the fabulous fare, order soju with lemon or yuzu chum charum. Free dessert if you rate them on Yelp. :)  Seating is super hard, bring a cushion. They played too much hip hop and not enough KPop.",

We reached in time for the Happy Hour and they have a great bbq and appetizer menu. We had jalapeno poppers with salmon (real jalapeno and it had a great kick!), fried calamari, garlic calamari, beef toro, pork belly, korean chicken with fondue, bulgogi and spicy pork and they are all pretty tasty. The price was also reasonable around $2-$4 for the happy hour dishes and around $4-$9  for non happy hour dishes. The servings are also pretty good sized.   The only down side is that we had to pay for lettuce and miso which is usually free. I would definitely come back here again.",

If it wasnt for the awesome variety of food to choose from, I wouldve ordered the Harami Miso all night! So tender and tasty.. do yourself a favor and grab 2 (or 3) of these.   Also, make your taste buds happy and grab the Spicy Tuna Kimbap. If i didnt love my wife, I wouldve hog cheese that thing and ate the whole thing. Im from Hawaii, so spicy tuna over cooked rice isnt uncommon, but there's were definitely the best i've ever had..  definitely one of the best cook your own food style of eating ive ever been too. great quality of food and awesome service. you cant go wrong by dining here!",

    "text": "I was disappointed with this restaurant. The idea of cooking our own Asian BBQ fusion seemed fun enough, but only if correctly executed. The meat came at least 15 minutes ahead of my broccoli fondu, then the fondue was overheated so half of the cheese was stuck to the container. Then they never brought our steamed rice either! After we asked about the rice, they asked us if we wanted to cancel the rice instead of taking it to go like we asked, because they were trying so hard to shove us out of the booth so they could give it to the next customer. To top off this poor dining experience, the waiter briskly dropped the check at the table without refilling my empty drink, or asking if we wanted dessert. I'm scared away from gimmick restaurants for life. Awful!!!",

It definitely is quality you can taste!! The servers were attentive and demonstrated teamwork. The 1.5 hour wait was worth it and we will definitely return next time we visit Vegas!! The only improvements I can recommend are the seats (really hard and uncomfortable) and the waitlist protocol. They should have a buzzer or take down phone number to send a text. We had to wait even longer because they supposedly called out our name four times and we went for a stroll since there were still 6 parties in ahead of us.",

    "text": "So one might say Korean BBQ isn't the best EDC-recovery food but we were around the area and decided to check this place out due to the raving reviews (and also because we were tired of paying $$$ for mediocre Asian food on the strip).  The wait was around 15 minutes at 1:30pm on a Monday (although the lady on the phone gave us an hour wait on the phone just 10 minutes before we arrived). We ordered spicy ramen with Japanese sausages, marinated Kalbi, Bulgogi, and thinly sliced toro. All were super delicious!  Overall, very impressed by the quality of this Las Vegas Korean restaurant, I think we'll definitely be back if we're staying on the strip again. My only complaint was that it was 110 degrees outside and either the AC was broken or wasn't on strong enough but we were sweating through the meal ):",

They've got combo options that breaks everything into sets for a group which makes things easy. There were so many side dishes, we barely had room on the table for everything!

I was there on a Sunday night for dinner and it was pretty busy. I opted for a seat at the bar to skip the wait. The only difference sitting there is the food is cooked for you and bought out to you instead of cooking it at the table.  They had some combos for parties of two, four or six. You can also order individual plates. I think you have to order at least two to get the free sides.  I ended up trying the Bulgolbi, spicy pork and the sweet corn. All three were good. The pork was a little sweet but it was good.  The sides were Kim chi, spicy bean sprouts, spicy cucumbers, and three others that I forgot but all were good. A very filling meal.  Service was excellent even though it was busy. I'll definitely be back.",

It's pretty cheap for a la carte especially since I don't eat that much. Their meat is really good quality. Comparing it to other AYCE bbq places is definitely not even close.   The week that I found out about this place, I went like 4 times again after that. I wanted to bring everyone to it and show them how good it is! I feel like it's definitely hidden, but it's right next to UNLV so it's convenient when I don't know what to eat, I usually suggest here for a quick lunch.  Meat I always order: Bulgolgi, Beef toro, Brisket, and Bacon wrapped Salmon. I always get their steamed egg too. BEST steamed egg I've ever had in my life!  Their three different sauces are to die for and they're great! They also give you lemon for your beef tongue! Really tasty!  The lunch special comes with rice, miso soup, and salad. The salad is huge! And it's reasonably priced at lunch, so do try to come in for lunch!  Their desserts are SO good too! We've had the green tea and vanilla ice cream. Their sundae's come with little pocky sticks too! MM What a great idea!!!  I definitely recommend this place if you're trying to find some prime meat!  Service is AMAZING. The staff are so friendly and accommodating.  Most definitely a 5 star place.",

The meal includes the regular samjan and sesame oil, but also includes three dipping sauces. The meat is high quality. My tip is to get the boneless short rib over the Waygu--just as tasty, maybe better.  At first, the portions may seem small, but somehow it's adequate. Six of us ate here, had two rounds of soju and a plethora of meat and our bill was $160.  Additionally the Korean K-pop/R&B keeps you on beat while cooking.",

The dishes were good tasty and quantity. THe problem were all about service. The waitress and waiters were all annoying my request. ANd they even forgot the order for my mom(took 30 minutes serve dish). They looks unkind except only one woman who was in reception desk. I think the problem came from service system which was not designate table. That means they may share the tips.  Frankly, I won't be there again even not quite super tasty. I don't want keep asking and waiting anymore. I will try other Korean restaurant.",

I had to get up multiple times to ask for anything such as napkins, more drinks, etc.  I left full based on the quantity but was expecting the quality to be better.

We got on the waiting list. 2 other partys ahead. Got seated 30 mins later.   Went ahead and order the Gangnam package for 4. $120. Spicy tofu soup $9.95. The server took our drink orders. 3 waters and 2 thai tea. Waters came out first. Thai tea came out late. When the thai tea came out with was in the smallest cup I ever seen served thai tea and it was just okay. Anyways the raw meats, sides and such came all different times. The server just drop off the mear to us and didn't help us throw the meat on the grill. All self service I guess.   Service was bad. I clearly needed water refill badly. Empty cup on the edge of table. Servers walking past me over and over. I had to flagged one down to get a refill. Also we ask for extra rice and received it at the end. Everything seem rush. We ask for to go boxes and the server even forgot about that.   We never got refills on the complimentary side dishes like other koream bbq spots. Their side dishes were good tho. As well as the meats we ordered. But the service totally killed it. Never again I'll go to this spot  Overhype. Overpriced. Just head down to other korean bbq in chinatown.",

In LA Japanese and Korean bbq that has 4.5 - 5 stars they use imported charcoal and really careful with the meat. Overall experience: disappointed. Not worth the money.",

We ordered the cream cheese wonton, fried calamari, (2) beef toro and (2) bulgogi. They also gave us the ban chan (side dishes) when you order a minimum of 2 BBQ dishes. The rice bowl portions are pretty hug so depending on how much meat you get I think one bowl can fit between you and another person. I love how it definitely fills up 2 people with less of a price than all you can eat KBBQ joints here in Vegas (Tofu Hut, Korean Garden BBQ). Overall great experience, will be coming back again soon!",

Their prime kalbi and Filet mignon were amazing. I would give 5 stars for that. Their mushroom medley was on point as well. Also, the servers were attentive and nice. However, their bulgogi bibimbob and bulgogi were too sweet and too salty. My mom and I had a spoon each and couldn't proceed with the rice. Maybe ordering white rice would have been a better option. Flat iron garlic and Harami miso were also too salty that it was hard to proceed. Their nangmyun is worth trying - one of the better ones I had in the US.   Overall, if you happen to go to this place, order non-marinated meet. I was between 3 and 4 stars and decided on 3 because the rating is too high and wanted to give people an honest opinion that is different from the majority. I hope this review is helpful!",

All of the appetizers and complimentary banchan was good except for the oysters. The love oysters and eat them all the time back at home but these oysters did not taste fresh at all. The carpaccio was also amazing. The kobe style beef was the highlight. It literally melted in my mouth. I wanted to keep eating the Kobe all day. The only meat that I didn't enjoy in the set was the galbi and harami miso. I eat galbi regularly but the marinade in both items were too sweet. The shrimp bibimbap was not what i expected at all but it was good. Bibimbap normally has spicy notes to it but this bibimbap was sweet. Overall, it was a great experience. Definitely a good place to try while in Vegas.",

Also, I recommend to order Kobe ssam, which is urchin on top of beef lettuce wrap. It was completely different experience compare to Japanese style urchin. We order the meat lover combo for 4 people. The meat was really fresh, and it should be enough for 4 people. Last thing, don't forget to check-in and redeem your macaroon ice cream. If it's free, why not plus it is delicious",

It looked like some locals were enjoying bowls of soup, etc. that may be better...but as far as bbq goes, this really missed the mark for us.",

(Usually you come across bad cold or hot spots on grills, but theirs was great.)  The only thing I didn't care for was the speed of service. Took a while to get our food, and desert took a long time. Service with expeditiousness aside was fine. Hostess and servers were very nice.  Would I recommend this place to others? Yes. Would I come back here myself? Yes.",

    "text": "We came in around 7pm on a Friday night and was told the wait would be 40 minutes or so. It's too late to go to another place anyways so we decided to wait. They have a nice waiting area with big screen playing music videos so it's not too bad.  After 40 minutes or maybe a little longer we were seated and offered menu. However it took them a really long time to come back to take our order. People who were seated after us got their orders taken way before ours. That was strike #1.  Finally the server came take our order and we opted for the Gangnam set thinking it probably has the most popular items. Since we had more than two people we ordered a chicken fried rice thinking it should be enough food. It took the server a long time to bring us the banchan and water. Nothing special about the banchan and it was a little disappointing from a non-ayce place.  Chicken fried rice arrived first before any other starter items. Which was okay because I was really hungry so any food that came to the table was welcomed. Fried rice was hot with huge chunks of chicken and nice separated grains.  The starters all tasted quite decent. Oyster was fresh and sweet. HOWEVER! Now that I went back to look at menu writing this review I realized they didn't give us the fried calamari! (I was going to give this place 2 stars but now it's down to 1)   We chose bulgogi bibimbap instead of white rice and Korean prime kalbi instead of the kalbi. The bibimbap was nice and hot. We started to grill our first item which was the filet mignon. Right when I was about to dip that into the sauce I found out the server didn't give us any sauce. At first I thought this place doesn't offer sauce but then it's kind of impossible because all kbbq places I've been to have some kind of sauce or at least salt? Then we looked around and saw sauce plates on every single table but ours. Then we had to track down the busy waiter before we could proceed to eat our meal. Strike #2.   Halfway through the meal the server came to take away some empty meat plates and my sister's bowl that she was eating her fried rice and bibimbap with. I looked at the server in disbelief because she was still eating her meal. Not only was the service slow the entire night but when they chose to be attentive they did it the wrong way. Since the server's too hard to track down now my sister had to eat her meal with no bowl. Strike #3.   The nice thing about this place is that we can do yelp check-in and get free macaroon ice cream sandwich for dessert. We got coffee, strawberry, and mango and they just tasted like any macaroon ice cream sandwich at most ayce kbbq places. The quality of the meat here is not better than other ayce places and that's a big disappointment from the great reviews they have.   I think this place is really lacking in service here. I felt that the kitchen was working very hard and able to provide nice fried rice in a timely manner so they're doing their job right. If they can better train their server I believe they can reduce the wait time significantly.",

We chose a meat lovers dinner for 2 which featured bulkogi, kalbi(ribs), thin sliced ribeye, pork belly(unsmoked bacon) and spicy pork.   This also came with 10 side dishes, rice and 2 kinds of salad. SO MUCH FOOD!!  This place is as good as value as you'll find in Las Vegas.  Strongly recommend!!!",

We stayed at the hard rock hotel, and this was a very quick walk across the street - less than 3 minutes' walk, and probably just under 20 minutes or a 5-min cab from the strip. The price was exceptional for the quality as well. Can't recommend enough. I just wish I had a location like thos at home.",

The two of us both opted-in for the lunch special: One with bulgogi and the other with pork belly. The lunch special also came with rice & a soup or salad, and an appetizer (I got the edamame) We also agreed on an ala carte order of the Korean Prime Kalbi.  All 3 meats were delicious. The Korean Prime Kalbi was definitely my favorite. The meat was marinated perfectly and turned out to be juicy & tender when cooked. The bulgogi & pork belly were good too, especially with the variation if dipping sauces.  This is the perfect little KBBQ spot for those who are pressed on time or simply do not want an AYCE menu.",

    "text": "Had a ball at this swank and hip Asian style barbecue bar. It feels like an Americanized Asian gastro pub. Very high quality Korean BBQ. Replete with the grill in the center and semi self-cooking (but enough assistance so you don't get yourself into trouble and accidentally give yourself food poisoning). Service is strong and sincere. I couldn't ask for better. Someone bright and foot- forward immediately greets you upon arrival. The atmosphere is dark and broody, but hilarious and elegant at the same time. How shall I say? It's a girl who wears Burberry but has a goth Asian tattoo. It was fairly busy on a Friday night after 9, but didn't feel crowded. They seem to keep tables moving, as our wait was only 20 minutes. And it was fine. The little benches make you feel you are part of the action. And there is cool K-pop (Korean popular music, for us gringos) as well as videos playing. Fun atmosphere. And you will feel just as comfortable whether North or South of 30.  Now for the food: The banchan (or side dishes) were a little uninspired, I have to say: Macaroni salad was the only whimsical touch, but  it lacked flavor. The standby kimchi was a little dull and off balance, in my opinion (though my dining companions liked it). The sprouts were good, though. I would have liked cut up hot dogs like some others are doing now.  But the bbq part, the meat, was fresh and delicious. Wagyu beef was rich. The bimbimbap was so deep in flavor and the shrimps on it were cooked perfectly. I was not a fan of the poke dish, but it was still excellent. If you're in the neighborhood of UNLV, and have the time and money, check this place out. The AYCE is a bit pricey, at around $30-40 for all the good stuff, but it's a good night out.",

They should just do AYCE kbbq here because the quality of the meat is mediocre and you can find this at any Korean bbq restaurant. There's nothing special about this place. We ordered the Gangnam menu which came with Bulgogi, Prime Galbi, filet mignon, mushroom medley, oysters, shishito peppers and Bulgogi bibimbap and some other stuff for $68. Maybe my expectations were high due to the reviews and thinking because this place is a la carte that the food was going to be good. But I was wrong. The only thing good about this place was the Bulgogi bibimbap. Everything else was mediocre. I'd enjoy this place if it was AYCE due to the quality of the food. Even the sides weren't that good. Some of it were warm as if it were sitting out. Don't come here with high expectations. You will regret it",

    "text": "Well I was visiting and luckily the Hard Rock Hotel was close by to this Korean BBQ joint. With all the raving reviews, I just couldn't pass up the opportunity to try the place.  I came at the beginning of the lunch hour and had a seat at the bar. Staff was attentive and friendly which was a good sign. I ordered mulnaengmyun (cold noodle soup), filet mignon, and marinated kalbi.  Mulnaengmyun - It's hard to find a place that serves slushy broth which they serve. Usually it's the broth with ice cubes that dilute the flavor of the broth. Nice touch definitely. It came with the standard buckwheat noodles. I really like the extra chewy chik/kudzu noodles but hard to find. Overall solid broth and decorated nicely.        4/5 stars  Filet mignon - Well I think the name probably sets expectations too high. It was solid morsels of meat with good flavor. But not necessarily the extra tender and soft texture that you're expecting.    3/5 stars.  Marinated kalbi - Definitely spot on. Not too sweet & sticky, enough fat marbling to give a buttery taste, and chewy but not rubbery. Next time I would rather make two orders of the kalbi now that I know.    4/5 stars  Overall, a great experience. The restaurant is clean, modern and minimalist in style. I will stop by the next time I'm in town and update my review.    4/5 stars",

They are very attentive but do not cook the meat for you.  We came for happy hour and got the pork toro. Pork belly and bolgolgi.  The toro is such a thick cut it's so delicious.  The pork belly is very lean which I appreciate so much.  The bulgogi is well marinated but when you cook it kinda falls apart into very small pieces.  The mushroom medley is precooked and brought out later.  It is drizzled in butter so it's very soft and tons of umami flavors.  Overall we had an excellent experience.  Even though it wasn't all you can eat we were so full and the bill was so reasonable given quality of the meats.",

    "text": "A good Korean BBQ place. Nothing special about the restaurant. Their BBQ was pretty decent! Would've gave it 7/10. Their family portions are much more cost worthy than buying single dishes. We got the Gangnam special for 6 people. I came with a party a party of 9 and got 3 extra plates of meat and multiple appetizers along with the Gangnam family special. Happy hour starts at 3 and has a few selection of appetizers, plates of meat, and half off drinks such as Soju and Beers!  TL;DR: Worth the cost if split among groups since most of the deals are family sized servings.",

    "text": "Right off the bat the food is DELICIOUS! They served a variety of traditional Korean side dishes (kimchi, daikon, cucumber, etc.) and offer different meal sets for 2-6 people. With lots of choices of meats, appetizers, soups, and vegetables.   My family and I are from Hawaii and we were dying for some Korean food. We came around 8 pm and the waited around 30 minutes. The wait was supposed to be longer but lots of people left because they were waiting longer than is. Hence why we got to sit down pretty fast. The ambiance is nice, modern and up to date (as far as furniture and music). Booths against the wall can easily sit up to 6 people, tables in the middle 4, and they also have one private room/section that can fit a big party.   The guy who sat us was very nice and welcoming. But I feel like the servers, I wouldn't say rude but the tone in their voice and the way they talked to us didn't seemed nice. For example: I asked \"what kind of sauce is this?\" While oiling the grill, our waiter quickly cut me off at the end of my question and said \"yeah hold on, let me do this first and I'll explain it.\" In a sort of rude tone. Even when my dad asked about the yelp offer the waiter cuts him off mid sentence, \"oh yeah the yelp thing, we'll do that later\" in that same rude tone.   I gave this place 4 stars because the wait time and food was great, better than most places in Hawaii (Hawaii has lots of great Korean BBQ, hence why I was so impressed) I would defiantly come back here, just needs improvements on the way waiters talk to their guest.   Tip: make sure to check in so you can get a free macaron ice cream sandwich, super good!",

Overall amazing! Defiantly exceeded my expectations.   One suggestion I would make is that, although their service was very good, but for someone who's their first time, would want a introduction once they are seated which we didn't get. I had to ask them for an introduction and let them know this is our first time.",

We were greeted and seated fairly quickly. We came around 11 pm. We noticed after we ordered everyone got a small green menu (the happy hour menu) that we did not receive. Their happy hour starts at 10pm. One of our drinks came without a straw. (not a big deal...but just careless). Had to ask twice for a refill for water when our cups were completely empty...not even any ice left.   We ordered the garlic shrimp (two orders). This item was really delicious! Probably the best thing we tried. The steamed egg is a HUGE portion. It was good but a little bit salty. The spicy lemon chicken was good...didn't taste like lemon at all. In the picture it looked like the lemon sauce was going to come on the side...which we did not get. Seaweed salad was about average. Pork belly was good. Asparagus was really yummy. I would recommend that.   Never asked us if we want dessert, just silently dropped off the bill. Service wasn't that bad but little things make a big difference. I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend this place. Theres better options in Vegas, but this place is open late and in a good location with tons of parking. The food is decent as well.",

    "text": "I didn't know there was a Korean BBQ this close to UNLV until I found this place on Yelp !   Their menu is very similar to Gyu-Kaku. Meats are a la carte. They have combination sets , lunch specials (before 3 pm) , and happy hour (3 pm - 6 pm & 10 pm - closing).   We settled with their lunch special which is a really good value since it comes w/ banchan , rice , house salad (or miso soup) , one or two meats and an appetizer. I ordered the bulgogi & the meats we grilled were well marinated and tender. I tend to skip bulgogi at AYCE places because they're usually not marinated that good but here you can really taste the quality. Prime kalbi is not included in lunch specials but ordered it anyways since we were dining here already and I wanted to see how it compared to other places. Their kalbi was excellent and had good marbling. Servings aren't necessarily huge , but it's an ample amount of meat. You would get pretty full off eating just one or two.  Love that they offer a lot on their dessert menu ! They have the Brick macaron ice creams (same ones they have at Gen KBBQ and No. 1 Boba Tea) , honey toast , ice cream mochi , banana tempura , etc. If you spend over 15$ and check-in on Yelp , you get a free macaron ice cream of your choice.  Interior is very sleek and modern. Ventilation is good , the restaurant didn't smell smokey at all. The tables are kinda too wide , there is quite a distance between customers sitting across from each other. Music isn't super loud though so it wasn't a problem having a conversation. They have a nice playlist going on too.  This place is a nice alternative to AYCE KBBQ. Staff is very attentive and friendly ! Most definitely a 5 star place :)",

    "text": "Introduction: Ok, so I am super picky when it comes to my Korean BBQ.  Which is why it took me so long to try one out until today.  Being new to Las Vegas with so many choices, I did not want to be disappointed and traumatized not wanting to try anywhere else if my first experience is bad.  However, thanks to my fellow yelpers, I uncovered the AMAZING Gangnam Asian BBQ.  Quality: 5/5 Omg! Five STARS hands down.  Everything we ordered were top quality and the marinating was perfection!  Probably one of the better Korean BBQ I've ever had.  Cleanliness: 5/5 Very clean and organize.  Price: 4/5 The price was actually good, the reason why I gave it a four and not five stars is because they charge you items that I don't feel should be charge for.  For example, you get charge for steam rice. Pretty much anything you order, you get charge, but steam rice? I am not sure about water, but I hope not. Anyhow, it's really not the fact that we get charge, just that it feels like you get that nickel and dime to death feeling. Especially when the food is so AMAZING, it's the principal. Steam rice is so darn cheap anyway.  I must say that I was expecting a charge on my refills, lemons, lime juice and sauces, but I wasn't, so it was a good surprise. The steam rice one really shocked me, I can see fried or even brown rice.  But again, it's not that big of a deal, just peculiar to me.  Customer Service: 4/5 The service was great initially and when you are about to leave.  However, during the time we were there, it was ok. The girls were not as attentive like we would like them to be. For instance, we have to flag them down regularly for refills, more sauce, new grill, etc.   We're use to being checked on at Korean BBQ'S. Maybe that's how they role here in Las Vegas cause I remember reading a bunch of reviews at other places that has the same feedbacks.  We just have to suck it up I guess.  Tips: Clearly, this is not an all you can eat type of Korean BBQ.  There were two of us and our bill came out to $60 with taxes, two drinks, a brown and steam rice.  But we don't eat that much, so if you are a big eater, expect to pay more.  For us, it was perfect!    They have the BEST macaron ice cream and it's free if you check in on yelp.  We will definitely be back, the yummy food overrides the other hiccups.",

That's when I found Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining. I looked at the ratings and was a bit spectacle because all the authentic kbbq I've been to don't have this high of a rating. In my mind maybe this place is more catered mainly towards non Koreans; however, I was very wrong. This restaurant authentic enough where Korean people like me can enjoy, while still welcoming to people that aren't accustomed to kbbq. This place definitely is the best kbbq me and my parents ever had in America period! It is definitely better than most kbbq restaurants in Korea itself!   The quality of the meat is amazing and the meat is marinate well. Definitely worth the price. Not only the meat is good, the bachans(side dishes) are amazing as well! This is the first time where my family actually enjoyed the banchan at a Korean restaurant in America. Normally, they would complain that this banchan is too sweet or salty. But this time, they just kept on eating without even saying a single complaint.   For this quality, one might think that the portions are small, but no it was pretty big. We ordered for 2 people and by the end of the meal, we were full. Barely had room for that free macaron ice cream.   The food was good, but the service was good as the food. They were so polite and got us refills on bachans without us even asking. My family always hate asking servers for more banchan because they don't like talking to people much and usually it takes awhile. But our server instantly got us our banchan before we were even thought of asking him if we can have some more.   This was a good way to end our trip at Vegas. After some bad buffet food, this was a good breath of fresh air. Definitely coming back here if I ever visit Vegas again instead of those overpriced, terrible buffets.",

    "text": "Everything about this place lived up to my expectations. My husband and I came for our wedding anniversary. I have been counting the days down until I can indulge into some gangnam style....pause.   We ordered pork belly, filet mignon, salmon wrapped in bacon, tempura kabocha, oysters, the spicy chicken wings, spicy garlic edamame, and the famous spicy tuna kimbap! First of all, spicy tuna kimbap is mmmmbop good! It's a roll of seaweed with rice in it fried into a tempura with spicy tuna atop. It was deeelish if you are a fan of raw fish, especially the spicy tuna flavor. It is a MUST GET when you come. You failed if you didn't order it to give it a shot. Don't expect the sizes of the meat to be on steroids. The meat are sliced so when you grill it yourself it doesn't take forever to cook. I think the portioning were perfect enough so you could indulge and enjoy whatever other items you ordered; therefore, you weren't meat overload. Unless, you came in with your carnivorous spirit on green.  All the side dishes (banchans) come free with the meal were delicious as well. I don't know if these side dishes are on a daily rotation, but we received 6 different servings of side dishes. These were bean sprouts, kimchi, kimchi like cucumber, Mac salad, radish (daikon) in a pool of some sweet sauce, and cuttlefish. The cuttlefish was so tender. It was my fave out of the banchans. I mean honestly, I don't think I was breathing as I was scarfing my food down.   We came in on a Tuesday evening. The ambiance was perfect. If you've been following my reviews you'd probably know by now that I come from a family of 6. I'm raising 4 boys and a husband. Lol. So this quiet time, is so much needed! It wasn't overly busy when we walked in. But as the night progressed so did the patrons. On a Tuesday night to have such business tells you something. The servers were great. Checked on us as often enough to not make me start secretly grumbling as a waiter approached. They were very good at clearing your table off of empty dishes so that was great as I dislike clutter. They did seem a little overly eager on certain parts such as the grill being used or not, but hey...I get it. Don't wanna char the grill or waste propane. That'd be equivalent to me telling my kids to turn the light off if no one is in the room. Except, we still had pieces on the grill that still needed grilling. My husband and I did give each other a look after awhile. But no biggy.   I'd come back over and over until they give me reasons not to. The facility is clean. The colors are very zen like and I love that they have a projector screen of music videos playing. They played a mixture of rap and kpop.   Good vibe, enjoyable food...definitely recommend! They do have high chairs, but expect it to be busy so I'd keep the stroller in the trunk, though there's space for it.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "I haven't been this satisfied with Asian BBQ before! I've been to Sura BBQ and Tofu hut, but they don't even compare to Gangnam. Sura is too pricey and I am a little taken back by how they place the raw meat outside.  Anywhoo, Gangnam was a nice alternate to that, since they serve you your food like Tofu Hut. However the quality of the meat is far tastier. Everything that I had was delicious!   We ordered the beef belly, BACON WRAPPED SCALLOPS, spicy garlic edamame, fried chicken karrage and the banana tempura with ice cream. This is definitely one of the rare occasions where i can honestly say i loved every bite. The service was phenomenal and we came during happy hour. They also have a Robata special after 10pm, must try!  The proportions were excellent and presentation was beautiful. (Especially the beef belly and banana tempura)  The exterior of the restaurant does not give it justice to the inside because i was pleasantly surprised by how pretty it was in there, and I did not expect a place like that to be so close to UNLV.   The ambiance is appropriate for all types of parties from romantic to large parties. (:  I will definitely return & try the whole menu!",

We had a spicy tuna kimbap, prime kalbi (beef), spicy chicken w/ lemon, & asparagus. All items were very good. The beef & chicken were grilled at the table. They were nicely seasoned. Right portions for us.   The spicy tuna kimbap was chunks of tuna in mayonnaise laced with sriracha sauce, served over rice balls wrapped in nori, lightly battered and deep fried. It was very tasty.   Pieces of prime kalbi were tender & very good. I preferred them grilled rare. The spicy chicken pieces were well marinated and tasted real good when lightly dipped in lime juice. The asparagus was cooked yet lightly crunchy, the way I liked. Every thing went well with the Sapporo beer on draft.   We finished our meal with banana tempura served with vanilla ice cream, topped with whipped cream. I wished I ordered a cup of black coffee to go with it.   Our server was professional & friendly. She was running a bit ragged because she had many tables to attend to.   We will definitely return to this restaurant the next time we are in Las Vegas, NV.",

I pulled up the Yelp app on the phone and this was at the top and had massive good ratings from patrons.  We decided to try it and were not disappointed.  We chose the meat lovers option for two and were thoroughly happy with the choice.  It is pretty cool to sit there and cook your food and eat it straight off the grill.  All the side elements are great too, some are pretty hot, but even for this wuss I still enjoyed the spicy sides.  Since our first time here we have brought friends twice and they all experience the same enjoyment as we did.",

Location (4/5): The restaurant locates in a corner of a big plaza. Watch out for the big Gangnam sign! From the outside, the restaurant looks pretty dark but it becomes divey when you walk inside.  Services (5/5): We came at 7pm in a party of 7 and quickly get situated! Our server was very friendly. She was also quick at prepping for our BBQ and bringing out side dishes! Since we came in a large group, they also helped us to calculate 18% gratitude fee in the bill.   Food (4/5): You have the choices of ordering individual dishes or order a set such as Las Vegas, Meat Lover, Gangnam (#1 bestseller) and Premium (best cuts). All sets come available for 2, 4 or 6 people with different prices. We ordered Meat Lover for 4 people for a party of 6 adults and 1 child. The portions were huge! It also came with complimentary side dishes, miso soups, rice bowls, salads and dumplings. It was more than enough for us! We also ordered the Kobe Beef Carpaccio ($9.95) and Salmon Carpaccio ($7.95). The Kobe beef was literally melting in my mouth! Soooooo sofffttt! The salmon, on the other hand, added a hint of freshness in a jungle of grilled meat! For dessert, we shared a vanilla macaron ice cream from Brick's! They have the macaron ice cream fridge right at the door, so give it a try if you need a togo dessert!    I will definitely come back for more :)",

It's probably the cheapest BBQ I've had that does not sacrifice on quality. There were many different options, a la carte or combos for 2 or more people- we decided a la carte was better since we could order exactly what we wanted. Pork belly is my favorite, so we had several portions of it in addition to the spicy pork. Also ordered kimchi jjigae on the side. The taste of the kimchi was a little off that day, so naturally, the jjigae had the same flavor, but it wasn't too bad. There was plenty of panchan, and all of the dipping sauces were complimentary, including the sesame oil and salt (they no longer charge additional for it).  Service was excellent. The servers were very friendly and attentive, refilling our drinks and panchan as needed. So glad I tried them out and would definitely consider them again next time I'm in Vegas.",

The prices are pretty reasonable, although I know most of you will whine that they aren't AYCE. They have slightly lower prices on certain meats during lunch and happy hour. I started off with the typical pork belly, beef brisket and seaweed salad. I must say the quality of meats is a step above the other AYCE places on Spring Mtn. hence you get what you pay for. Both meats were very delicious and I was still a tad bit hungry so my server recommended to me pork toro. The meat was just okay and I actually prefer the pork belly instead of this, plus it's cheaper too. The service was good for the most part, but since the place was empty, at one point the server and host both disappeared on me, which delayed me from ordering my second round of meat. It wasn't too big a deal because someone eventually appeared again in the dinning room. I live really close to this place and I will probably be coming more often. This is a perfect option if you want Korean BBQ, but your waistline can't afford to do AYCE. Also a nice place for lunch, because if I would of stuck to the beef brisket, pork belly and rice my bill would of been around $10. Can't wait to come back especially since eating here won't break my budget.",

Now keep in mind they do not have AYCE, which is good because you don't have meat just lying out until it is all gone; quality control is what I would say about their meat!  Now for beginners or people who never been to a Asian BBQ style restaurant like this, I would suggest ordering al la carte first.  I know they offer combo meal but it's a lot of food and you may be gambling with what you \"may\" like or not like.  You can always order as you cook.  Service is excellent and they check up on you in timely manners.  That was a big plus for me...we all know that server at that restaurant where the server just keeps coming back and interrupting...well that is not the case here.    As for location, it is situated in a shopping center that offers multiple eatery places, sushi, mexican, etc.  The only thing I would be caution on is that it is located across the street from Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.  I can only imagine just how busy they may be during the weekend.  If you don't want to wait or be in a crowded situation, I would suggest going during the week days.    The thought of them now while writing this review makes my mouth water again!  Hahaha!",

We ordered Bibimbap ($12) and spicy Sukiyaki Noodles ($9), our server tossed the dishes for us on their sizzling hot plates, brought us hot tea and let us eat our enormous portions in quiet recovery (this IS Vegas after all, who isn't having breakfast at early dinner time, and nursing some form of hang over?).   As the restaurant got busier, our solo server got some help as a new guy started his shift, and we weren't forgotten in the hustle.  The interior of the restaurant is soothing, Asian minimalism, a nice balance between Japanese and Korean stylings, as is the food. I love trying restaurants off the strip in Vegas, as they are SO much better quality and pricing than anything near the touristy parts.   Gangnam was so much more appetizing than anything we could have hoped for on a post-EDC weekend  ;D  Located in the corner of a mini-mall, if you love legit, delicious, fine Asian dining, you MUST come here!",

    "text": "A Japanese restaurant in Korean BBQ clothing. First off all the 5 star ratings are rigged as they \"Bribe\" you with free dessert for a review and must see it. I will pay for my own dessert thank you very much(Best thing on the menu btw).  I live in OC and close to Ktown so I guess you can say I'm spoiled but when you ask for Korean radish and they have no idea what you're taking about and everything is in Japanese something is a miss. In looking around it was brilliant as there are many sushi restaurants in LV and 2 in the same shopping center as Gangnam (btw really I should have known better) so the owner thought hey we can serve Korean and then bribe yelpers with free dessert for the 2k worth of reviews. For all you yelpers that sold out for dessert SHAME.....ding ding.......SHAME!!!!!  It's not the worst place if you don't know better and could get 3 stars tops but I feel duped as I fell for the 2 thousand plus reviews.   Anyway do your homework and look for authentic KBBQ .",

It comes with tons of meat (best of which is the beef toro), broccoli cheese fondue (amazing combination), bugolgi bimbimbap, house salad and a bunch of small Korean appetizers (fish cake is delicious). The meat came in raw and unlike other Korean bbq places, you gotta do BBQ yourself and it's definitely the fun part. If you can't finish all, you can get it to go. Came on a Sat noon for lunch and the place wasn't super crowded. The service was decent and food came really really fast. Don't forget to check in here as you get a free macaron ice cream sandwich.",

The food is moderate. Quality degraded. And not sure if those wagyu Kobe are even real. For 4 to 6 BBQ which is only good for 1 or 2 at the most you'll end up paying a minimum of $50. Might as well go to AYCE Korran BBQ.   Totally not worth it.  Overrated, overpriced. Not coming back!",

    "text": "A refreshing spin on Las Vegas Korean BBQ.  Environment: The restaurant is located near UNLV and the area itself is in that less-than-impressive area behind the strip but the business of the area does help to detract from the somewhat uninviting surroundings. The inside of the restaurant however is pleasantly hip and reminds me of a cross between Gen and Hobak in that there are some neon lights as well as wooden benches giving the restaurant a trendy yet homey feel.   Food: As per usual for non-all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ spots, it's typically best to go with one of the pre-made sets, which offer a variety of meats as well as a selection of side-dishes. The one we went with seemed to be the most popular choice, and it was a little out of the ordinary compared to other restaurants. It did come with a variety of meats, along with an interesting salad, the standard Korean side dishes, and my favorites, yuzu shishito peppers and 4 oysters on half shell. Additionally, there was a bibimbap which was surprisingly delicious as well. The meats themselves were mostly marinated which was good, because the sauces we were given were underwhelming and blended into each other or did not have enough impact. They also did have a happy hour when we went in which was nice because it was a Friday night and half off any soju and beer is always a great thing.  Service: Service was appropriate and was prompt. Additionally, one of our servers was especially helpful and was helpful in changing the grill anytime we required it.  Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with this restaurant after hearing a lot about it and not really knowing what exactly to expect, and I will most likely be coming back again soon!",

I had the lunch special and tried the bulgogi and Korean chicken for protein, house salad, cream cheese wonton for appetizer, and added beef brisket and rice. I think the meat was marinated a little too sweet (I am a meat lover btw). I really like the cream cheese wonton, but not the sauce that came with it. The restaurant was clean. It only have one restroom stall for each gender. I had a tall, Korean waiter and he was doing a great job even though he forgot to bring the macaroni salad I requested. It's okay though. I saw him running back and forth, so I didn't get upset. Overall, the food here was mediocre. I live in SoCal and I prefer the kbbq in or near my area because it an all-you-can-eat restaurant and/or buffet. The restaurant was clean. It only have one restroom stall for each gender. They also have a little bar area. So, I think this place is ok, not bad of course.",

Checked the reviews and decided right away to try the place... And guess what?! EXTREMELY SATISFIED!!! Especially that I am a big Korean Dish Lover!!! I enjoyed my Bulgogi Bibimbap! Really tasty! My family opted for some Bulgogi, Pork Belly and Brisket since they have a HAPPY HOUR SPECIAL!! This is such an awesome spot!! The meats are really tender and juicy! I loved the Pork Belly the most! The environment is really clean and the servers are really friendly and informative! They made sure that we know how the menu works. They also offer some Japanese dishes! But I recommend the Korean dishes more. The side dishes are also amazing, they are honestly to die for! I always go to Koreatown in LA and yes, it has the same quality as it is in KTown! Will definitely come back whenever I visit Las Vegas!!!",

It took them about 5 minutes to take our order since it was a rather busy night.  The server brought us the side dishes right away.  When I asked a passing waitress for water several minutes later, she told me that MY server will bring me water later..........the water came 3 minutes later but with quite a bit of attitude.  Just placed it on the table without saying a word and with a rather annoyed look about her.  My experience with the service so far has been average., although may be typical for a Korean restaurant.  Now on to the wait for the food.........(the longer the dots....the longer the wait)..........is 10 minutes a long wait?........3 of the 6 items ordered came at the 11 minute mark........5 more minutes later 1 more item came.......3 minutes more and my fifth item came......I don't get how long it takes to cook udon for my little daughter.....anyway, 3 more minutes later and my daughter finally has her udon.  The food was actually very tasty and worth the walk from the strip but I am not entirely happy with the service.  Would I come back again ($64K question)...probably as long as I can tolerate the wait and service.  Time to hit the slots and win me back some money.",

First off the prices are a bit over inflated as is evident by the constant \"sale\" prices on the menu, everything is apparently half off and it still is not worth it.  We ordered a combination that allowed us to try just about everything they had on the menu.  The only items that I would have given more than two stars were the bulgogi and some fried chicken bites in a spicy sauce.  The scallops we ordered were not cooked properly (almost raw) and had a bit of funky fishy taste to them (in an old scallop way).  The service was very poor and quite slow.  When we brought the quality of the scallops to our server's attention, he commented \"well, that just how they are here.\" As someone who enjoys good Korean BBQ, I had high hopes for this restaurant, but it simply failed to impress and for the money you would be much happier going somewhere else, like Honey Pig.",

We had a group of 8 and called about 30 min ahead and our table was ready for us when we arrived (around 830pm on a Friday). Service was super fast and most of our dishes came out within 5 min of ordering. Our fave dishes were the steamed chili dumplings, dynamite shrimp, spicy chicken with lemon sauce, bulgogi, kobe and the filet mignon. Everything was perfectly seasoned and gobbled up immediately. Honestly the veg options were delicious too--particularly the sweet corn (which you can grill) and the broccoli and cheese fondu (already cooked.) The best part though was that all the complimentary sides (and there are a ton) are brought to you immediately so you can start snacking away while perusing the large menu. Cool place to check out and especially fun with a large group. Also don't forget the Yelp check-in offer for a free dessert macaron! Not amazing, but hey it's dessert and its free.",

Ordered the original bibimbap, squash tempura, and flat iron garlic and bacon wrapped scallops for the grill. You MUST order the scallops!!!! So delicious!  Everything else was tasty, too.  Atmosphere was great, people are having a good time, the place is super clean, music is fun. Great spot for family meal, catching up with friends, or an adventure in grilling your own food!  Did I mention the servers were fantastic?? Jihoon took great care of us tonight.",

    "text": "First of all - we were inspired to come to Korean BBQ after setting an ad for another place on a billboard. After Yelping some nearby options, the 1300 reviews and a 4.5 star rating, drew us in.   At 7pm on a Saturday, we just weren't sure we could get in so we called ahead and a friendly young man answered. While they don't have a call ahead or reservation list we were able to walk right in.. Though apparently it's not uncommon to have a wait.   After being immediately seated, we were promptly asked for our drink order. And moments after asked if we were ready to order -- through out our meal the service has been efficient,  immediate, and impeccable!   Let's talk about the meal!  We selected the meat lovers meal for 2, though you can order piecemeal - this included 6 meats, 7 sides, and 3 appetisers for $60 after tax. So if you aren't familiar with Korean BBQ, the premises is that they provide the food and you cook it at a grill on your table.  Breaking it down:  APPETISERS Miso Soup Green Salad Steamed Chili Dumplings Spicy Garlic Edamame   MEAT Spicy pork Bulgogi Beef Toro Flat Iron Garlic Pork Belly Filet Minion  SIDES - I am guesstimating what each of these items are, we did not get a rundown.  Bean Sprouts - Good, nice crunch to them, and not particularly strong in flavor. Kimchi - very flavorful without being off putting (assuming you don't dislike kimchi in general) Fish Cakes Jalapenos, Onion, and Ginger - they were in a mild marinade of some sort, really good when we grilled them too! Macaroni Salad - noodles were a little soft for my taste and too mayonnaisey but my friend liked it.  Spicy Squid (I think!) - really delicious (and I don't like seafood, at all), the dressing/marinade was flavorful, almost like the kimchi, and the texture was just right, not too chewy but hardy  Spicy Baby Cucumbers - may have been pickled, but overall nice crunchy texture with a  Rice - sticky and white.. Just a vehicle for everything else! (Forgive me for the constant 'flavorful marinade' comments but I have no idea what it is... Just good! Ha!)  DESSERT Banana Tempura Lava Cake  SAUCES - provided in a little side dish per person!  Spicy soy sauce Sweet soy sauce ? Mild soy sauce-type  Now, you'll notice the extensive reviews for this restaurant... Because they offer a free dessert per Yelp review. They definitely follow through and not based on the score or content! They only check that you post it!   A couple thoughts on improvement --  Provide some direction for cooking each item (meat and sides). While I was familiar with the process, its always nice to hear tips and tricks to making this a  delicious and easy meal.",

First off, the location is convenient and not too far off the strip right across from the Hard Rock Hotel.    The strip mall. It's in is clean and the interior of the restaurant is modern and tastefully decorated--and again; CLEAN.  It is open until 1 am and we arrived about 11:45 pm.  Although it was late and near closing, we still received excellent and friendly service without ever feeling like being rushed.  We ordered the most popular meal package: The Gangnam which came with a variety of meat cuts and marinades, rice bimibap and assorted dishes like Kim chee and what have you.  They also brought out fresh oysters as well as steamed mushrooms.  Again, everything was super fresh and absolutely delicious!  Highly recommended!",

All of the meats were beautifully marinated and we enjoyed grilling them to perfection. We would've ordered more food and would've had another round of drinks and would redeem our Yelp desert offer if we weren't given a check while we were still eating. After the food arrived we could not get anyone's attention for more drinks and more rice. Finally, I caught one of the guys that was running by and asked for what we needed.

    "text": "I have to explain first hand why this place gets a one star.  It's not like this place deserves a low rating and that you better stay away at all costs but having relied on yelp ratings for my first two Korean BBQ meals here in Vegas for Magal and Hobak (both with 4.5 stars with hundreds of reviews) I thought for sure this place must be just as good with 4.5 stars with thousands of reviews.  So with the bar being set from my experience at Magal and Hobak, these are the the things that fall short here.  Service - It's not like it was bad.  It was attentive enough but here you have to do all the grilling yourself.  This was the major disappointment for me when I found out I had to do my own cooking.  Heck I would have stayed home if I had to do my own cooking.  Price - I was able to feed my family of four for $100 at Hobak.  Here it started at $120.  Here the steamed egg side dish was extra and so was dessert.  Both of these were included at the other two.  If you checked in Yelp here you were offered a free macaron ice cream sandwich.  We shared this one macaron amongst the four of us each taking a small bite LOL.  Food - Maybe I overcooked the food or something but the food just didn't seem to taste as good and the beef cuts were just not as premium as the other places.  I think you can order more premium cuts but you had to pay more for it which I guess would fall into price and value just not as good as the others.  I really didn't care for the mushroom medley or the jalapeno peppers that were provided as part of the Gangnam combo.  So with the bar being set with the other two who are at 4.5 stars, Gangnam just doesn't come close so that's why for me it's at the other end of the spectrum.  Maybe I had high expectations going in but we came away very disappointed.",

However, they were still good. The beef carpaccio was AMAZING and highly suggested. The vegetable dishes were meh, and took forever to come.   I like this place because of the value and the fact that the food was pretty good. Also, that it's an authentic Korean restaurant run by Korean people. The service was attentive and efficient.

Our sides arrived quickly.  I noticed that we were the minority and the clientele was primarily Asian so I took that as a good sign.    Having never had Korean BBQ before it would have been nice to get some instruction on what to do with everything. As an example, we cooked our meat on the sides instead of in the middle and it kept sticking to the grill. When there was just a little meat left on one plate, the server placed it on the grill for us and that's when we realized our placement error.  Another thing that might be helpful is some type of labeling on all of the different items so we would know what we were eating.   Everything we had was delicious.  I think the standout for me with regards to main dishes was the marinated pork.  All the appetizers were amazing.  The miso soup was so rich and flavorful.  The dressing on the salad was delicious and just the right amount of sweet.  The chili dumplings had a really tasty sauce and I thoroughly enjoyed the spicy garlic edamame.   We discovered why they have so many reviews, too! Free dessert for posting a review. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience and would like to try it again, maybe someplace else to see if the experience is the same.",

It was only about a 7 minute rideshare from the MGM Grand where we were staying.  The Kobe beef was tender and full of flavor!  I highly suggest the bulgogi bibambop as well!  All of the side dishes were on point and the sweet corn was truly sweet!  I highly suggest this restaurant!",

The grill isn't like other typical Korean BBQ which gets dirty quickly and provides a nice even hot plate for the food to cook. Loved the side dishes. The salmon poppers were great. Scallops were tasty and the meat was succulent.",

I went with two of my buddies and it was our first time there. We were greeted and seated promptly. Little did we know but we arrived during happy hour. 50% off pitchers and some of the dishes were priced at or around $4.00.  We advised the waitress that this was our first time and she recommended that we do the special for two people(+15% off for happy hour) and if we wanted to order some additional sides. I believe we ended up ordering the #1 with all the different beef options and also two sides of toro. The amount of food that came out was really overwhelming. As with any KBBQ spot the side dishes arrived (kimchi, Mac salad, salad, and some other items) along with the sides came 4 oysters, bibimap(fried rice), mushrooms and I believe that was all. If you have a chance definitely stop in because the food was great. With the three of us the bill came out to around $34/ea.",

The complimentary sides were good --- macaroni salad was a little odd but still okay, but the kimchi had some nice heat to it. I ordered garlic duck breast and bulgogi along with a bunch of appetizers...tuna poki, salmon jalapeno poppers,spicy tuna bimbap, and seafood pancake. Oddly, when the meat came out, rice didn't accompany it. Is that common to order rice separately? Bulgogi was flavorful and tender, and so was the duck breast. Tuna poki was spicy...not my favorite...spicy tuna bimbap was so yummy! Seafood pancake was a HOT MESS. Not cohesive...fell apart and properly need a few more minutes of cooking and a lot more seasoning. Salmon poppers had too much going on. I personally didn't like most of the appetizers but the main meats were really good.  I wrote this honest review in exchange for a free macaron ice cream.",

    "text": "Another amazing KBBQ experience down. It's become a tradition now for me and my best friend to have KBBQ at the start of the new year. Not wanting to do AYCE this time around, we found Gangnam and decided to give it a try. I am so happy that we did!   Gangnam is located pretty close to the Hard Rock, next to a lot of other restaurants. Even on a Friday night during rush hour and Gangnam's HH, parking was not difficult to find. There was about a 10 minute wait for us to get a table, but they were busy, so no worries.   As I said, we came during HH and it was a pretty good value for the price. Some of the things we ordered off the HH menu were: beef brisket, beef bulgogi, pork belly, spicy garlic edamame, fried calamari, cream cheese wontons, and sweet corn. When it comes to the HH menu, I would recommend focusing on the meats. Nothing else wowed us, but I did like the wontons. The bulgogi was excellent, the best part! We ordered a couple of things that were not included in the HH menu: Prime kalbi and cream cheese corn. The price for the amount of kalbi you get might seem a little steep, but the quality and taste were great.   The service was so-so. Our grill was checked on frequently, but we were not. Nobody was particularly friendly, but I chose to look past that because I only came there to eat.   I had a pretty good first impression of Gangnam. It was a nice change to get away from AYCE. I feel like I ate about the same amount of food as I would have at an AYCE place, but ended up spending less money. It was definitely a good value. I would go there again.",

    "text": "I'm not a big fan of korean bbq in the first place but I usually like a few items at each place I try. For this place, definitely get the beef toro. It just melts in your mouth cause how thin it is and marbling of the fat. The Kobe beef is super tender but tends to be oily. you might want to add some wasabi and salt to cut down the oil taste. For $25, it's a pretty small portion but Kobe beef has always been expensive. I've tried Kobe beef in Japan too. I still love it with shabu shabu more than bbq. The spicy lemon chicken was okay but I didn't really like the korean kalbi. The kalbi has too much of the marinate so it was too strong for my taste. Ended up spending $47 for myself but mainly because of the Kobe beef.",

    "text": "This is one of the few places that we tried in Vegas. My cousin was the one who recommended this and i would say it's just ok comparable to many bbq Korean bbq places that we tried.  We had the pork bulgogi, marinated beef, chicken wrapped in bacon, marinated shrimp, oyster, bibimbop .  It was quite a meal but a little pricey I would say maybe because I am  comparing it to some Korean BBQ restaurants which you will pay $25 per head with unlimited serving of all the different meat choices.  The oyster to my husband and cousin is a big hit.  It's  a hot plate and you cook the meat but what I noticed is that they don't change the plate which is why some of the meat got burned.  In some places, they change the plate several times well that is for unlimited serving but I would suggest at least do a 2nd round of hot plate especially if there's more meat ordered.   We had a good ice cream desert macaroons and it's worth a try.",

Ordered the Golbi prime rib for around ten dollars -- ordered twice the portions. With all the extra side items like Kimchi, potato salad, seaweed, rice, you're getting an incredible deal for a ton of food.  Compared to Los Angeles Korean BBQ, while it quite doesn't match the quality, it makes up for its pricing. Soowon Golbi is good -- but fifty dollars? Gangnam Asian adjusts their price to compel a repeat visit.",

We had a choice of having 2 bowls of white rice or 1 hot stone pot Korean Bbq with rice. Of course we chose hot stone Korean bbq with rice: we let the rice sit in the pot after mix so it will form nice crust. Oh, yum! Banchans and salad were great, too. The food could have enough for 3-4 people. Everything was delicious and seasoned perfectly. We ended up packing leftovers because it would have been sin if we left them to be thrown out. We thoroughly enjoyed the leftovers as well. Yum !!!",

I ordered the spicy seafood ramen and my friend ordered the bibimbap. For my ramen, it tasted like instant ramen that I can just buy at the store. They did add some calamari and other seafood in the soup, which was just ok. Also, it wasn't spicy. For the bibimbap, my friend loved it! She said the meat was flavorful and the veggies were crunchy. We both did enjoy the side dishes that were brought out to the both of us.  I am willing to give this place another try, but I might just have to go with their BBQ next time, since this is what the place is known for.",

After that I asked for calimori to start with. then she walked away. When tasting the items on the table they looked and tasted like they have been sitting in these bowls for a while not fresh and also cold. After she came back with the beef and put them on the fire grill in the middle of the table I asked what these bowls were. She explains they are starters. And then told me what they were. At that point I should have got a bowl of rice. My appetizer came out last. Tjats wasnt a good order",

It's located within a small plaza, only 7-10 minute drive from the Strip. Parking lot is relatively small but we had no problems with it.  The restaurant is relatively small, but I like the ambiance and seating arrangements. The waiters are very efficient and helpful. The meat can cook pretty fast if the heat is set on high, so adjust accordingly to your own pace.  The food is amazing. While I don't have the most discernible tastebuds out there, I liked everything in the Meat Lover combo there, which consisted of banchan (some of the best I have had), miso soups with rice, seaweed and green salads, dumplings, and all the meats, which are very well seasoned (spicy pork, bulgogi, beef toro, prime kalbi chuck, pork belly - amazing, and filet mignon).  You get free ice cream with Yelp check-in, and that was also delicious. I would highly recommend this place and will definitely come back if I go to Vegas again.",

We love Korean food and wanted to experience the  BBQ dining experience. Our waitress was marvelous and so was every server that brought our food and changed our grill. We decided to go fill out and have the Premium and boy were we not dissapointed! The money spent here was well worth it! Gladly would spend more here than one of those ritzy buffers on the strip.  We kept receiving plates after plates to our table, different cut meats, tuna, oysters, rice, kimchi and etc. It was heaven!! There was so much food! I told myself I'd eat as much as I could, the grill was then set and we cooked our meat according to our liking.  Their Thai tea was amazing also! Great, great experience!  *****Check in on Yelp and you get a free ice cream macaroon. The macaroons are delicious! Recommend the green tea one! Overall, this has been the best restaurant we've been to thus far during our visit here in Vegas. Definitely recommend this location! Great food, great experience and great staff.",

They were attentive to our needs and gave us awesome recommendations too.   We ordered the Gangnam combo with another order of pork belly and a couple of drinks. Every meat in the Gangnam combo was marinated, high quality and made it a sexual foodgasm experience to the max. I wasn't blown away by the pork belly, it was meh.  And as for drinks, The peach soju is the bomb dot com!!! Delicious and easy to down.   Hopefully you get the same awesome servers / experience as I do!!

We came right when it opened-- there was a line waiting for the restaurant to begin serving and certainly im Glad I came here.   Here is the breakdown:  FOOD  You can order a la carte or go for the set menu, and they came in a couple of different tiers. My friend and I went for the most expensive one and it did not disappoint.  Good quality meat, good selections and it is very generous portioning for the price. Definitely felt that my money was well spent and was getting what I paid for.  SERVICE  The food came at a reasonable time and definitely appreciate when they let us have the experience, cook at our pace and enjoy each meat nicely without feeling rushed.   The waiter was very nice and had a nice small talk with him while he offered to cook for us.  DECOR/ AMBIAnCE  Definitely a casual environment but a nice casual environment.

    "text": "Came here with a group of 10 on a Saturday mid-afternoon and was promptly seated.   I immediately noticed the banchan (Korean side dishes placed around our table's 2 grills). They had all my favorites ranging from fish cakes, kimchi, cucumbers, macaroni salad...we ended up requesting another round :)   My group was starving from our drive into Vegas so naturally our eyes were bigger than our stomachs when we sat down to order. Our plan was to order their prix fix menu enough to feed 10 (2 orders of Gangnam [1 order can serve 2 people for $67]; 3 orders of Meat Lover [1 order can serve 2 for $56/order]). These packages comes with a variety of starter dishes like oysters (by far, my favorite starter), salad, various cuts of meat/BBQ dishes. Our waiter, however, recommended 2 orders of each instead as it is A LOT of food. Good thing we listed because you will NOT leave hungry here.   Oysters: I'm usually hesitant about oysters at BBQ dining establishments but surprisingly these were sweet, fresh, not too big/not too small, with green onions, ponzu sauce?, and sriracha I believe.   Cuts of meat: they vary from Kalbi, prime rib, filet, pork belly etc. Some were heavily marinated and a bit salty but the flavor profile was on point. Due to long grilling, some cuts came out particularly dry, however, so be careful not to overcook.   Overall - I'd definitely come back when I'm back in Vegas. Great for big groups; come hungry and leave happy :)",

The restaurant was very clean, service was extremely fast, and the meats were delicious. We got the \"gangnam\" package for 2 which includes various BBQ meats and starters. I was just getting over a stomach virus and didn't care for the oysters or calamari and asked if we could skip some of the starter items and substitute it with the galbi soup. Our waiter was so nice, flexible, and made it happen without any hassle. The galbi soup was cooked so well -- the meat was tender, soup was light but had great flavor. All the side dishes were tasty and replenished when they were empty. The BBQ meats were all super tender and well seasoned. The staff there were so attentive and multiple people came by to grab empty plates and check on us. Definitely one of the best KBBQ places I've ever been to, highly recommend!",

Pretty decent sized menu with a lot of good options. There were 8 of us and we were all pretty hungry. We ordered a ton of food. Of the banchan was ok. The favorite was surprisingly the fish cakes. I ordered the bulgogi bibimbab and the cream cheese wontons (really just cream cheese inside ...) while almost everyone else ordered BBQ. The two least excited about it got fried rice and tried everyone's dishes. The bulgogi bibimbab was delicious. Perfectly cooked and flavored bulgogi. The rice was nice and crispy like it should be and the spicy sauce for it was a little sweet and a little spicy. Perfect dish! Everyone really enjoyed their first Korean BBQ experience. Would love to go back next time we visit",

But, it was Saturday night. It's only slightly bad though because you can walk around the strip mall or up the street to pass the time. Food was good. I esp liked the Flat iron garlic, not fatty with good flavor. You get complimentary sides with 2 BBQ options. My faves were the fried squid. Sweet and spicy with a wonderful chewy texture. All in all a really good dining experience",

As busy at the wait staff were, they managed to always be a step ahead of me when it came to refilling beverages and replenishing side dishes.  I was so impressed.  I ordered the braised gal bi and beef jap chae.  Portions were reasonable and the braised dish was so tender and flavorful.  This will have to be a tradition whenever I visit Las Vegas.  I checked in for a complimentary macaroon ice cream for a sweet finish, which they seemed happy to honor.  This place fully lived up to their ratings.",

Especially compared to gyu Kaku, their lunch deal is great but gangnam happy hour is better. And I like that their meats actually come unmarinated. The portion sizes are large for a single person and they actually include the side dishes. So if you somehow are making a choice between here happy hour and gyu Kaku lunch, pick here. Geography might make that a bit of a challenge though.",

It comes pre picked the course basically depending on which you pick. You can also go the other route and just pick the dishes. My husband and i went that route instead. We got 2 orders of the belly toro (brisket) short ribs marinated beef tongue. For our sides there were some complimentary with a min order of two beef plates. We got on our table the steamed egg and calamari. Some lettuce and bean paste as well that's an upcharge not much though. Everything came out to 50 that's with tips included.

My party of 3 was famished so we went to town on the happy hour menu; available everyday 3pm-6pm and again at 10pm-12:45am) - the HH menu isn't huge, but it had a good variety so we stuck to it.   They only offer complimentary side dishes (banchan) with a minimum of 2 BBQ dishes per person, but we had no problem meeting that quota. All of the sides offered were fresh and flavorful - we also enjoyed extra rounds. Also, they offered 3 dipping sauces light, medium, and a dark one. They were all tasty but my favorite was definitely the darkest one - it was salty, sweet and a bit spicy.   HH items we tried: Cream cheese wontons - 4/5 Sweet corn - 5/5 (very sweet and buttery but tiny) Mushroom medley with butter - 4/5 Garlic in butter - 5/5 Jalapeno poppers - 5/5 (delicious) Korean chicken cheese fondue - 3/5 Spicy pork - 4/5 Pork belly - 5/5 (we loved this the most!) Bulgogi - 3/5  When dining outside of happy hour, the regular menu is massive so I'm sure you will be able to find something, even for the the pickiest of eaters. Also, pricing seemed fairly competitive with Gyu-Kaku (their direct competitor.) The grill tops and ventilation setup at each table worked very well; they conveniently changed out our charred grill per our request and the restaurant wasn't smokey or smelly.  After the feast you know we all needed a cup of caffeine to snap us out of the food coma.  Good times!",

We ate until we were so full, I suspected some of us went to vomit so we could make more room. Hence the bad bathroom smell (only negative but not enough to deduct a star) The food consisted of meats, plenty of veggies and side dishes. I ordered the squid as a side dish. It was a little disappointing, 5 pieces that shrunk into nothingness. But the meats were more than made up for that. You grill your own food, there are 3 sauces to dip it into. Overall, great flavor, great service, painfully full belly afterward.",

We ordered the harami miso, the Korean prime kalbi, the beef toro, and the bulgogi. Everything was great but my absolute favorites were the Korean kalbi and beef toro!!! Next time I want to order two of these! Haha. The portions were decent and the food came out fast! The service was good and very attentive, the waiters all spoke English super well so there wasn't a language barrier like other Korean places. And I love that this place wasn't ayce since I usually don't go to ayce bc I can't eat that much and it's not worth the cost hahaha but here you can order as you please! :) I left here feeling full & satisfied but not stuffed and gross like I do after ayce!  P.S. i'm use to eating kbbq back in ktown in LA and this hands down is wayyyyy better than any other place (including non-AYCE places). I wish this was closer to home, i would be going here every weekend! This is as good as it gets!",

    "text": "Sadly, one of the worst kbbq spots I've dined at in a very long time. Do take into account that my palate has been spoiled from dining at all the kbbq spots in LA.  I've had this place bookmarked for a long time now, but never actually got to going because of the mixed reviews I was getting. Four and a half stars on yelp and a visiting friend from New York finally got me to pay this spot a visit. We ordered the gangnam combo for a party of three which was more than enough food. This combo is meant to feed two people for $66. The combo came with five kinds of meats, fresh oysters, quartered sweet corn on the cob, bibimbap or side of white rice, miso soup, and mushroom medley. All cuts were subpar in my opinion. Bulgogi was too sweet and chunks were not cut up. The filet mignon was my least favorite. The chunks were rather large. Putting in work for something tasty was worthwhile, but for meats that did not taste at all fresh, that's just asking for too much. The bibimbap was simply sweet rice and beef. Not much veggies and hot sauce mixed in like the typical bibimbap dish. My favorite part of he meal was probably the soon tofu we ordered in addition to the gangnam combo. Soup was tasty and the seafood bits aroused surprise with each bite. This place also does not cook your meat for you. So roll up your sleeves, tie back you hair, and get cooking!  Would I come again? Definitely not. Not worth the money. You might as well go elsewhere that will cook your meat for you for cheaper with better quality meat.  Free dessert with yelp review post.",

I can't believe how much food we were served. This was supposed to be for 2 people, but even with the 3 of us we couldn't finish all of it.  This restaurant is very very efficient. We were asked if we wanted to be seated at the bar. We said yes and all of the sides and food were being handed to us at the speed of light. The only thing they didn't do is feed us so that we could get out sooner. I appreciate fast and efficient service!  I loved their spicy chicken and regular chicken!! The chicken was delicious and perfectly cooked. My friends worked on eating the beef. The restaurant gave us freshly made miso which was light and refreshing. I am so used to eating the crappy instant miso. This use of real miso paste was a welcome touch. Their sides are good, but nothing to write home about.  The amount of food and decent quality definitely justified the $45 cost.",

This is my gfs go to for KBBQ and I'm glad we came here for lunch! Free dessert with review!!",

It's a trendy but intimate type place that kind of looks like the place in Rush Hour 2 where they're singing karaoke. But be different than me and order 1 of their 3 best sellers, I tried to order brisket and filet mignon like I was in Texas because they will cook that filet well done! But the short ribs are legit, and so is the flank steak! It comes with 6 authentic sides if you order two or more dishes and the cost are reasonable per dish! You can eat 2 or 3 by yourself or go with a large group and order the whole menu and share everything",

And we didn't get sick that night. So if your fixin for some meat then go no further OR go a little further to Koreatown, Los Angeles because that's the real standard.",

The service was AMAZING. UGH the best experience ever.   FOOD: MEAT: We ordered two types of meats: tenderloin and the galbi. You cook it yourself over the grill korean bbq style. The meat is honestly the best I've ever had. Quality was amazing, so juicy and tender. I'll be dreaming about this places meat forever. Definitely recommend ordering meat. The price was great for the amount given and quality. My brother (who was fairly hungry) was about to finish and feel perfectly satisfied.  SOUPS: my mom ordered the spicy tofu soup. ($9.50 I think). She said it was salty (it kind of was) but the flavor was SO GOOD. Had tons of seafood and a nice smokyish flavor. They give you white rice to eat it with to help with the saltiness. I   I ordered the Yuke Jang ($9.50) which is a spicy beef soup with clear noodles. It was okay. It was not salty but spicy. I kind of wish there was a more depth in flavor. I would skip this dish.   RICE: my dad ordered the original bibimbap ($12.50). I didn't get to try this one but this bowl is huge and my dad finished it all and said was good.  SERVICE: so fast and attentive. Usually I have a problem with places not being attentive and being slow to bring the checks and stuff. This was not the case here.   Make sure to check in on Yelp to get the free macaroon ice cream!",

The asparagus I grill at home is crisp, tasty and fresh. In other words, it cannot be beat and I look for restaurants to come close. The asparagus was good but not great. However the rest of the food exceeded expectations. The service was OUTSTANDING! The servers work as a team and quietly came to pick up plates, bring food and stopped in often without interrupting my dinner. I can't say enough about what a great experience this was. Of note, I'm headed to the airport and was in and out within the hour. Great food, great service. I'll be back. PS. The prices are excellent. Reasonable and well worth every penny!",

We've tried to come before, but heard the wait was over an hour. I think we're spoiled by the amazingly authentic Korean food in the Bay Area where we live. We have a neighborhood in Santa Clara on El Camino filled with great Korean restaurants on both sides of the street.   There were 4 of us, so we doubled up on the Gangnam dinner and we ordered the steamed egg. They delivered the meats promptly and it was plenty of food. I just didn't think the meat was well seasoned and high quality. It was just okay. We were almost done with cooking and eating the meat and the steamed egg still haven't arrived. We asked our server and a few minutes later, it came out. Unfortunately, the egg was completely overlooked. It was already deflated. The other ones we saw on the other tables seem way better than ours. Seems someone forgot to take it out.   With all the awesome restaurants in Las Vegas, we have better options for dinner.",

The server we had was wonderful and accommodating as we arrived for a late dinner 9:30ish. At that time, the restaurant is very packed for a late evening on a week day. I would call in for a reservation to be safe. Happy hour starts at 10pm, therefore we ask the server for the happy hour menu ahead of the time. We then placed items that was not on the happy hour to get started and later order happy hour when 10pm roll around. They there generous with the side dishes, food portions are decent, and most of all we were surprised at the final bill that came up to approx $176 including tips. The total was half the price we normally pay for gyukaku in NYC for a party of 6. That night we have a party of 8. I would come again for sure!",

For apps we had dukkboki and squash tempura. All were delicious.   The service was prompt and pleasant. Unlike hobak and goong you have to grill your own meat. I rather liked grilling myself so you can pace the speed you eat.  Price was very reasonable. For the three meat choices it was under $20.00 which was plenty for two people.   For free macaroon ice cream, complete a yelp check-in. The coffee flavor was awesome and it hit the spot.  Will definitely go back again.",

Check in on Yelp for a free ice cream macaron. The only thing I wouldn't recommend is their corn cheese - it had wayyyyy too much mayo. I'd recommend going during lunch hours to take advantage of their happy hour specials which helped us cut our bill a lot. We will be back the next time we are in Vegas!",

Actually, Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining is Tapa Style and not all you can eat Korean BBQ, (keep in mind, AYCE KBBQ it's not big in Vegas than it is in Cali).   We happened to come here during their Happy Hour menu offerings. So we paid for some of the meat choices at a really good price. For that we ended up doubling are orders of the: Toro Beef, Basil Chicken, Bulgogi Beef, Spicy Pork and Pork Belly. The portions we got were good for a party of three.   - Toro Beef: Its marbleized beef brisket and very flavorful. Not as fatty as the ones that you\"ll find at cheaper Korean BBQ places. It was my favorite out of our five choices.   - Pork Belly: Standard cut pork. Not bad at all, they were seasoned. The quality of the pork was good, and had tastiness to it.   - Spicy Pork: Tender cut pork. Smothered in spicy sweet marinade sauce makes this super delicious.   - Chicken Tender Basil: Tender white pieces of chicken. With touch of lemon and basil. They were simple but delicious and it accommodated well with my white rice.   - Bulgogi Beef: Beef was really tender and marinaded with a lot of flavor, very good!  nuff said.   The sauces that came with these were: Spicy Soy Sauce, Sweet Soy Sauce and Ponzu Sauce. The Spicy and the Sweet Soy were good. I even combined the sauces and it even adds for more taste to the tip of your tongue. The Ponzu, was the one I enjoyed dipping my meats in. It had that vinegar, sweet flavor to it.  Overall meat quality here, Excellent! The five choices we got didn't disappoint. Every meat was tender and easy too eat. Again, they were less fatty. We enjoyed every bite that came out of the mini-grill.   We got friendly service here. Our server was very personable, and she turned out to be a cool chick. We even got some Kimchi's on the house. Atmosphere here is modern. There is a big screen TV in one side that would play random upbeat music videos. Also there appears to be space to lounge or dance for the late night vibes.   Even though they don't offer all you can eat. They do combinations, but anything extra outside of that, can get pricey. That's why when they offered the Happy Hour menu, we chose meats with deeper discounts and for a party of three the portions were just right, for a tab around $35.   Eh, sexy lady...nom,nom,nom,nom...Oppa NomNom Style!",

Our last meal in Las Vegas was supposed to be Korean bbq. Instead, since we don't eat beef and the bbq options fed 4-6 people, we ordered a-la-cart. No regrets, the food was still delicious! We got an order of the spicy seafood ramen and kimchee bibimbap. I can handle spicy foods really well and enjoy my mouth on fire, but the *spicy* in spicy seafood ramen was no joke! However, the spiciness did not overpower the flavor of the broth. The kimchee bibimbap was amazing! I was happy to see it served in a stone pot to keep the temperatures piping hot. Servings were huge for such a reasonable price. Shout out to the sweetest hostess around too! She gave my mom suggestions on Korean beauty products and tended to us when the waiter was busy with other customers.",

I agree the portions are generous bit the quality just doesn't measure up to other places like Goong, Hobak, or Magal.  Organization was rough as well.  They started being out food and we ended up not having enough room at our table for everything so their solution was to start stacking plates on top of each other so the plates were sitting on top of other food including raw meat.  Although staff was always around our requests for more banchan never seemed to get filled as we had to ask several times.  Came here on the recommendation of someone we know but will be sticking to our preferred places mentioned earlier on this review.",

We also ordered fried rice and the sukiyaki noodles that were not on the HH menu. Both were very good, but the noodles were amazing. So rich and they don't short you on the chicken either (in both the noodles and rice). The honey bread dessert was probably the best honey bread I've had.   My only problem was the service. Our waitress was really rude. We felt rushed when we were trying to order, and while I was still clearly looking at the menu, she asked me to give it back to her. We wanted to order more food but she never came back so decided against it. We waited approximately 15-20 minutes to order dessert and then another 10 for the check. She was doing side work and looking at us but chose not to come over while we sat there waiting. So two other waiters came to help. It was really off-putting.   Nevertheless, I'll probably be back because the food was delicious. If the bad service continues however, I'm not sure it'll be worth it.",

There was bulgogi bimibab (Korean fried rice with barbecue steak), garlic shrimp, spicy marinated chicken, brisket, sweet marinated chicken, and we ordered short ribs on the side. Everything on it was delicious.   My only complaint was that, once we were served, the server completely forgot about us. Not one drink refill. When we were finished, we waited and finally got up and went to the hostess for boxes (there's a lot of food) and the bill.  Still, the food was very worth it.",

I would have rather gone to Hobak or Magal. The happy hour may be something to check out. Other than that, probably won't be making this a go-to spot for KBBQ.",

We made it with 10 minutes to spare to get happy hour prices and I have to agree with other reviews that you really do get a good amount of food for the price here. We ordered 2 types of kalbi, happy hour pork belly and bulgogi and happy hour edamame and seaweed salad. Our total was only $46 including tip (which is a great deal for 2 people when you're used to LA prices). The food was good quality and they give you plenty of side dishes. We didn't even really need the edamame and seaweed salad so we probably could have gotten away with spending under $40 for 2 people. Granted, this obviously isn't the best BBQ I've had, but it is a great value. I would come back here if I was ever in Vegas with a car again.",

    "text": "My rating is to WARN everyone of thee most disrespectful embarrassing and delinquent establishment I've ever been encountered with ! I use to love this place I loved it so much that Friday I decided to take my cousin and her bf who have never been to Loren BBQ before for their first experience and it ended in something I'd never imagined ! Our dinner was great as we were getting our check the waiter asked if we wanted dessert and of corse my son says yes as he saw the macaroon ice creams in the front by the door  waiter says if you have a yelp just check in and it's free . So of corse I do and down hill goes our night . A couple minutes later as we're eating desert another waiter comes over and says o have a phone call and I look at him confused as to why because he barely knows my name and no I know would know I'm there or have a urgent reason as to why the wouldn't call my phone so I get the phone as the waiter insist it's a emergency (here I'm thinking it's some joke or I won something ) then I answer and it's some random person claiming to be the manager and says that I have Been complained about for showing my tits in public mind you in with my family and have never been the type of person to such a thing I look around to see if someone joking and then the man on the phone proceeds to be disrespectful as I'm looking for the waiter to give him back the phone ask for the manager wich both the man on the phone and waiter claim they are my bf gets on the phone and goes at it with the guy asking him to show his face they e change words and all the while I'm waiting for my debit card and my bf to calm down . We finally walk out my cousin grabs the phone and *69 the phone and looks through the recent call list then the \"manger/waiter\" who gave me the phone takes it and tries telling her they called from another phone . Well we leave and realize that the call was made from inside thAt place . Idk what kind of sick fuck thought it was funny to ruin our dinner or play some disrespectful joke that way but it wasn't funny I hope they ready this and know that I did involve the police and they will be further involved being as how the next morning I woke up to fraud on my account and many transactions that were never made by me ! I have tried to call them and confront them but I have either been placed on hold or hung up on ! I hope you all read this and know these people are sick and I'd never agian recommend this place as a go too in my life !",

I came in very hungry and waited less than 25 mins on a Friday night with no reservation, and the food came extremely fast. My friend and I (him and I both eat big eaters) were overly full and the food was all amazing. We did the Las Vegas combo for $45, with a side of oysters for $7 and it was all crazy good! Can't wait to go back. The concept was awesome, service great, and food was all really yummy. Go here for sure!",

First thing I gotta say is that the interior was pretty nice. Every booth looks like there's a window from an old Korean palace haha. Modern interior though. The grills were great and kept the heat even and cooked everything nicely.  The food was also really good. Our party ordered the meat lover set ($99) for 4 people but trust it was a lot of food. They brought out soup and salad which was also included. Side dishes were on the better side when coming to a Korean BBQ place as well. All in all this place is worth a try!",

I was hesitant for years because it opened shortly after that Gangnam Style song came out, but moved to this side of town and I didn't want to go to Chinatown for Korean BBQ. This isn't all you can eat, but it's actually a lot more fun ordering and you get to be a little more selective. We ordered the spicy karaage, Kabocha squash tempura and the shishito peppers as appetizers. All delicious, especially the squash. We had reservations so all the complimentary side dishes were arranged around the grill upon arrival. For the grill we ordered two orders each of the scallops with bacon, bulgogi, harami miso, and Kalbi, along with an order of corn. We had five people in our party and we didn't finish it all, but got pretty close! It's a really fun experience and it doesn't feel as rushed or impersonal as other places. The decor is also really nice and it doesn't feel like your typical all you can eat/buffet place. Loved it and will definitely be back",

Funny how I just drove and pulled into this parking lot to make a Facebook post asking if anyone knew of any ramen or Korean places bc I needed Asian soup to help heal my ailing body. This parking lot was the same parking lot I was at a few trips ago when visiting Azusa Hookah Las Vegas and left my extra set of car keys. So I was destined to get in touch with my Korean roots. It is a perfectly sized place about 14 BBQ tables. I sat at the bar. I ordered the kimchi jigae. Soups are priced about $9.95 comes out in one of the Stone hot boiling pots. Before that came out you also get lucky  #7 banchans and the kimchi was perfectly fermented, stir fried fish cakes, cucumber kimchi, ojingeo muchim, spicy beans sprouts, pickled radish w/jalapenos and the famous pasta salad (or potato salad at other Korean places). I am one happy salty half Asian clam. My body is in sodium hell.... But that is the perils of Korean eats... But that kimchi jigae broth with the pork was making live to every taste bud in my mouth.  I will come back again every time I visit.  and",

We ordered veggie bibimbap, scallops, calamari, shrimp, mushrooms, onions, dynamite shrimp appetizer, asparagus, and king oyster mushroom. Also, hirami steak for me. Mainly seafood & veg bc my husband doesn't eat meat. The dynamite shrimp didnt come out until halfway through our meal. It was supposed to be appetizer. I think the server forgot to put it in bc he didnt write our order down. I think he got offended that I asked if he was going to write anything down. Oh well. Food was ok. I prefer gyu kaku. Faster service & better taste imo. We ordered the honey toast & it took fooorreever. Literally 20 min. The girl asked us twice what flavor icecream and she still gave us the wrong ones. If you've had honey toast in Hawaii, you know that the bread inside is usually hollowed out, cut into cubes & toasted with butter & drizzled with honey. This place did neither of those things. They left the bread inside whole & scooped icream on top. It was so hard to eat. We tried cutting it but it became a disaster & was so messy. We took a few bites & left it. The lazy male server was busy talking to another female server and left another female to clean off 2 of his tables & ours. He just kept yapping & didnt lift one finger to help clean off his own table. Unbelievable. The tip should go to the girls who helped us & kept checking on us but im sure they share tips.

Food was Awesome!!!!!! You can tell all meats are fresh, are good quality food. Server are really friendly, tough us how to eat and how to order. Also I did check-in, they gave us a free ice cream for the table. Nice experience!",

There were people waiting outside before they opened. :) Despite the amount of people the waiters were very attentive and were always checking to see how we were. Not only that but ALL the waiters came and checked on us! All the food that we had was great (original Bibimbap, fried dumplings, Chicken Karaage, Tteokbokki, Bulgogi, and Korean Prime Kolbi)and easy to enjoy. They had good music playing in the back ground that was not too loud and had a good mix of both Korean pop music and American pop music. An amazing find, thanks fellow Yelpers! :)",

    "text": "Went here last night with my husband for dinner since we haven't had Korean BBQ in a few months and we saw this place had some good ratings.  When we walked in we were greeted and seated immediately by the host/server. He was very polite and, thank goodness, spoke really good English!  We already looked at some of the stuff on their menu before we got there so we had a pretty good idea of what to order.  We ordered a few choice of meats: Bulgogi, flat iron garlic, beef toro, Korean prime rib kalbi, and the Harami Miso. The last two I mentioned were definitely a must have and it's also in the top two of their best sellers. The meat was really great quality and flavor was perfect.  They also had three different meat sauces that they provide which is perfect for the other meats that may not already be seasoned.  I love the little booths that they had as well. Only thing I probably would improve from this place is to have refillable hot tea and to have the sesame oil with salt side as something already provided for. I've never been to an Asian BBQ place that doesn't already do that so I guess that's why I mentioned that.  But other than the last two things, the entire place was awesome and highly recommended. I would go back there again with friends for sure!",

As far as Korean bbq goes they all have the same basic ingredients.  The way it is done here makes us keep returning.  Just the way it is served and the intricacy of the cuts pertaining to the grain of the meat.  Also the Japanese fusion appetizers are good as well.

The chicken fried rice has huge chunks of chicken which was nice to see.   Thanks to the happy hour menu we tried the Bulgogi which was marinated to perfection and the waiter helped us cook it. Also had the garlic shrimp which was good. I've always been nervous about he little side dishes you receive but everything was so good! Minus the pasta salad thing which didn't seem to fit.  Probably the most perfect end to our Vegas vacation! ________________________________________________  After submitting my review we were ignored for a good half hour. Our waiter was too busy being FED by a friend across the restaurant. Really? I get if you're friends come in to eat and you want to say hi or chit chat for a few minutes, but to completely abandon your table? That's rediculous. Actually nobody checked on us during that time, we had to flag a waitress down who really didn't seem to care. Finally a second waitress stopped by and asked how we were doing. They were having a promotion if you wrote a Yelp review your got a free dessert, so we showed our reviews and then waited and waited and waited for dessert. The waitress was very apologetic and even gave us macaroon ice cream for free, on top of our 2 free desserts. The only reason this isn't a 1 star reviews is because the food was amazing and the last waitress to help us was very nice and helpful.",

They brought it out with shrimp too, and when we told them, our sever said he'll just take out the shrimp for us. Umm.. No.. The rice tastes like shrimp now. Overall service was horrible, has to request more water 3 times, request for the grill to be changed, request for my check after waiting 15 minutes.  The reviews on YELP are totally FAKE because they offer a free dessert if you review them. No body is going to show them a 1 star review to get a dessert.  Definitely do not recommend.",

Onto the food, we got harami miso, Korean prime Kali, spicy tuna kimbap, fried calamari, bibimbap, and spicy tofu soup. Imo, everything was good, except the tofu soup. The meat cut was high quality, so tender and well seasoned. The appetizers are fried perfectly. Bibimbap was good, but at $12.99, i think I rather get another meat dish instead. The soup was just so so, not memorable.  The service was okay, no smile when greetings, but otherwise attentive.

Agree with some that other korean BBQ places wirh korean people there eating is a good sign of good korean food at a restuant.  No korean people present except myself at this place.  They charged us 18% tip atomic ally for 4 people. ?? A diet coke was $6 and one half Corn was $4 .  Not worth it at all.  Go to a real korean BBQ restaurant if u want authentic tic food and don't waste your time here.  Been to LA. New York and atlanta to name a few...and this was not even comparable to those restuarants.    If you are ok with eating over priced non authentic korean food and being charged for $6 dollars for a diet coke and getting bad food and Service,  this is definitely your place.",

This place carries a lot of value with the amount of different (yet satisfying) portions/packages that even a poor college student can afford.  My friend and I got the most basic Las Vegas package since we're hungry but obviously not capable of eating a feast by ourselves. It was $45/person and the amount of food cannot be more fulfilling. You get the tradition side dishes + a house salad, along with rice, sauces and miso soup to go along with your proteins that includes beef, spicy chicken, garlic shrimp and pork.  You are however required to cook things yourself comparing to places like Honey Pig when a server would occasionally stop by and manage your food. The place wasn't busy at the time we were dining so the servers volunteered to rotate our proteins for us as we were engaged in a deep conversation catching up on life- What a nice touch.   The ambiance of this place is on the smaller size but comfortable at the least. The service was friendly and attentive and most importantly, the food was amazing for the price that you're paying. I wasn't sure if it was Happy Hour when we dined but when we received our tab, it only came out to be $55. A lot less from what I was expected to pay (hey I'm not complaining) but regardless of it being a mistake or not, I'll happily return.",

They turned off our grills and we never saw our third round. When we asked where it was they told us \"that was three rounds split over two plates.\" WHAT?! Absolutely not. They didn't even offer or suggest purchasing more plates. I came ready to eat and left HUNGRY. We paid more than what we would have paid for an AYCE place and didn't even get a fraction of the amount of food or service. Our drinks were constantly empty and because of our fancy private room getting the servers attention was a struggle. Nice tasting bulgolgi, but their other meats are too thick and really fatty. Hit up anything on Spring Mountain for quality, quantity, and if you want to have money left over. Will not return. Do not recommend.",

I gotta admit I nearly did this myself--it would be awkward to show the server a two-star review when asking for a free dessert, wouldn't it? That's how they getcha.  We ordered the Meat Lover's BBQ for two, which at ~$56 for a single serving of meat, was obscenely overpriced. In cities with good Korean restaurants and more competition, you can get all-you-can-eat BBQ for $20/person. To top it off, the $56 doesn't even get you lettuce wraps, ssamjang, or sesame oil--you have to pay extra for each. Are you kidding me?  The meat itself was good. I mean, it's hard to mess up raw meat. However, the grill was electric! That was a first for me, and yet another disappointment with this restaurant. The meat obviously came out with no grill flavor whatsoever, and I could have cooked it better at home.  Our waitress was nice, and she was very good at topping up our water. However, not once did she offer to refill any of the banchan, so we ended up paying $56 for a single serving of meat AND sides. Lastly, she dropped off the check before we were even done, and I had to make several attempts to flag her down so that we could order dessert. She didn't clear the table for dessert, and we had to awkwardly share it among a bunch of empty dishes and leftover food, hunched over the giant table.",

The restaurant was quite busy even at this off hour and I have to imagine it's really busy during peak times. The food was really tasty though we didn't care for either the sake or soju that we tried.

They use gas here and you are left to cook on your own. This is fine sometimes we want to do it ourselves sometimes we are lazy. The annoying thing about this place is the giant screen playing rap videos. I get it its Vegas, but at lunchtime it can be a little much.",

    "text": "My husband and I were excited to try Korean BBQ during our recent trip to Vegas so we chose Gangnam over some other choices because of the plentiful and rave reviews. We did not have to wait, which was a plus, and we were given a large array of different sides (banchan) that we started sampling right away. We ordered way too much meat for just the two of us, but before we could even try to get our fill of the BBQ, we both started to feel nausea and stomach pain. We asked for our food to-go but never got around to eating it back at the hotel. We crawled into our hotel bed and slept away the pain. We never figured out what could have set off our stomach troubles. Our experience could have been a fluke and it should not be a reason to avoid visiting. The service was friendly and there seemed to be a lot of other happy diners!",

You would have to order a ridiculous amount to get full off of their portions. On top of that, they charge $2 for a small bowl of white rice. Their banchan was good and we were given a good amount. The waiter that we had were not very friendly. I couldn't get him to refill my Coke until the end of the meal. Over all this is not a place I would go back to again with a large group of people. I may revisit if it's me and another petite person who doesn't eat much. Don't go here if you want more bangs for your buck.",

Come during happy hour to get some small discounts on a few choices such as pork belly, beef toro, and bulgolgi. Also half off drinks during this time so not too shabby.   The one minor annoyance is the extra suecharges for what I would consider standard at most Korean BBQ joints such as lettuce and sesame oil but servers are nice and sometimes willing to just throw them in so it doesn't feel too bad :)  Check it out and enjoy!",

And we ordered their best selling combo for four people at $120, and a serving of noodle. It was more food than we can handle. Another thing I have to warn you is it was too hot! A room filled with grills should have AC cranked up a little bit higher. I'm normally cold everywhere I go. I even packed a long sleeve jacket with me. But I was sweating. Everything was great till we almost paid tip on top of their mandatory 18% tip, and that 18% was based on the total price plus tax. We were not aware of the mandatory tip and on the credit card receipt there is an blank for tip. So if we didn't look closely enough, we would paid double tip. I wasn't too happy about that. But before I gave a lower review I decided to call the manager and see what their response would be. To my pleasant surprise. The manager Jin not only listened and apologized to my concern, he also offered to reverse the tip. Of course I didn't take it and told him their service and food deserve at least that amount of tip. I was just simply addressing the mandatory tip thing may upset some customers. We ended up thanking each other for the nice gesture. And I will definitely go back there and refer my friends there!",

I've never had Korean BBQ in Vegas before, thinking that it can't beat LA K-town, but our family of 5 including my Mom loved the meat quality here, and the variety of dishes they offered.  Coming from spending 1hr wait time & $$$ on Bacchanal's the night before, I had a glimpse of thought that we should have come straight here instead for half the price.  As we bit into the first bites of our meal, we thought that it actually may be better than Ktown LA BBQ.  We ordered few extra dishes along with the premium meat combos.  All great, but next time, we'll eat the uni rice bowl without having it mixed for us by the waiter.  It would be much better if it's not thoroughly mixed in the hot pot, so that we can savor the uni.  They gave us free macaroon ice creams for each of us that checked in on yelp as well.  Either way, service was also excellent!",

The portion sizes were fair for the prices, and the quality of the meat was decent. We also got galbi tang, which was fantastic, and a cheesy corn appetizer that smelled and tasted a bit like dirty feet. I ate one bite and left the rest alone.   The service was good, not sure if that would be different for a non-Korean. They brought our food quickly, and replenished side dishes + got us a new grill plate when our first one got dirty.

Check in on Yelp app  This place was really really delicious! A must try and you will fill up with the amount of food they give you. I was happy with everything except the sides. They really didnt go well with the food and they were just all spicy sides. Ive have some great sides with these BBQ places like the pickled onions. But other than that. The service and food was great!",

I'm so happy I did, because it was worth every minute I waited (only 30) and every penny I spent. We got the special combination for 4, and it fed all 5 girls in my group with leftovers to spare!   The service was great, but the food here is truly the star. The cuts of meat are excellent and marinated better than any other Korean restaurant I've been to. Each piece literally melted in my mouth. I can't comment much on the side dishes because I filled up on protein!",

    "text": "So I'm giving this place a solid 4/5. One point off because the service was a little spotty near the end. I got the feeling that all the waiters were simply very fast paced and if they thought you didn't need them, they simply scurried about their business.   We went to Happy Hour right when it started at 3p on a Sunday. The menu is overly large and exciting which made us very indecisive. So we started off ordering only a few things with the plan to order more from there. Here's all of what we ordered and what I thought.   Bacon-Wrapped Asparagus - pretty simple and hard to mess up. But with all the other exciting options, I'd pass on it next time.   Sweet Cheese Corn - one of my favorites! It was sweet, but not too sweet. And adding cheese never hurts. I would definitely order this again!  Fried Wontons - This is obviously of staple of just about every Asian menu. They were yummy as always, but not noticeably different from any other place.   Filet Mignon - Again, very simple. But so enjoyable. Be responsible and don't over-cook it! The meat quality was great and is very tender and delicious when you keep it medium rare. I would order this again.   Bulgogi - Very easy to over-cook due to the thin slices. But if you watch it, it comes out very tender and the marinade was everything I wanted! I would definitely order this again!  Cream Cheese Wontons - The wonton wrapper was super thin and delicate. It had the perfect light Crunch before breaking through to the cream Cheese. The sweet sauce it came with was great! I would order these again!  Chicken Karrage - I had never had this anywhere. So I was surprised to see that the pieces of fried chicken were cut in all different shapes and sizes. In fact, at first I thought the waiter had brought us the wrong thing. I thought it was fried calamari! The chicken itself didn't have much flavor. But the spicy dipping sauce it came with was great! Not sure I'd bother ordering it again, though....  Korean Chicken Cheese Fondue - I enjoyed this chicken even more than I expected! I loved the Crunch that developed from grilling! While the insides remained tender. The cheese came in a little foil bowl. It was shredded and cold and immediately put of the grill. It tasted like an American cheese. I would get this chicken again.   Vanilla Ice Cream Macaron Sandwich - the Macaron was purple and I'm not sure what flavor it was meant to be - it simply tasted sweet to me. Even after being frozen, it still had that perfect Macaron chew. And the vanilla ice cream was so creamy and smooth!  We had a great time at this place and will definitely be back to try more!",

The food itself was so so and the meat very salty. I think most of these reviews are made up or paid for. It also took them like 15-20 minutes to get us our change... I had to walk up to the counter to request the change because they were taking ridiculously long and I had called a uber thinking it would take 5 minutes tops to get the change. Considering it was not too busy, this is ridiculous.  Plus the Asian cashier guy looks like a stereotypical Korean tool with the tool haircut and tool vibe. Plus he lies about the wait time.  Also, this place is literally a rip off of Gyukaku. This part is kind of funny... I think that they may have used to been a gyukaku since they still have the gyukaku logo on the front of the restaurant. Perhaps they just changed the name so they don't have to pay the franchise fees... but at the same time the service and food is a lot worse than a gyukaku",

The restaurant itself is very modern and clean with pop music playing in the background. Fairly easy to get to since it's just behind the Strip on Paradise.

I would also recommend the pork belly and prime kalbi, but all the meats we tried were delicious!  Oh, and the interior is a plus too.

    "text": "This place has 4.5 stars from 700+ reviews and it doesn't disappoint! The service is friendly and fast. The restaurant is clean and inviting with fun pop music playing in the background but most importantly the food is SO GOOD!  I highly recommend the Korean Kalbi - for $9 you get a generous portion of high quality, thickly sliced and deliciously seasoned meat. It was so good my girlfriend and I immediately ordered a second plate once we were done. The shishito peppers and mushroom medley were also amazing. Hell, everything we ordered was fresh and delicious and tasted amazing off the grill. Heck even the rice was really good and I'm Picky about rice so that's saying something.  We also ordered a bottle of soju to share (Jinro Chamisul) and it was the perfect drink to go with the meal.  My only complaint is that they do charge you for the sesame oil which is usually free in most korean BBQ places. But for the amazing prize, potions and quality of food who is complaining?  I would fly back to Vegas just to eat here ;) this place definitely was a huge highlight of my Vegas trip.",

I've eaten at several Asian BBQ types of places in the Los Angeles area, and we're glad that this wasn't our first experience because we never would've eaten at this style restaurant again. We chose this restaurant (driving through the state from LA to Utah) because of all the positive Yelp! comments, and we were just so surprised at how flavorless the food was. In addition, one member of our party ordered the beef gyoza appetizer that comes with the lunch menu,  and it was ice cold. We had to ask the server if it should've been served hot, which it was. We waited quite a bit for the appetizer to be prepared properly.   There are six mini appetizers that come with your lunch menu and after the gyoza experience, we weren't sure which of the items should've been hot or cold, and they were mostly unappetizing.  Service was also slow, could have been far more attentive, and the restaurant was not busy. It took an hour and a half for our lunch.   I hesitate to post this comment because obviously so many people think differently and really seem to love this restaurant. However, that said, I read reviews to get an idea of everyone's experience so this post is to reflect our experience. It could just be a matter of taste!",

Both times we came for the late night happy hour. The meat and veggies are really good, the staff are friendly and the prices are right. The combos are a good value, we opted to add to it with a couple dishes from the happy hour menu. The side dishes are good and have a good variety. I haven't been to any other KKBQ's in town, but I don't think we need to. They have everything we want and more. Some day we will hopefully be able to bring a few more people with us and really get more meat and veggies so the two of us can try more items. Definitely a must try and fun for the entire family, away from the craziness of the strip if you need that. (Yelp LA Challenge #44 of 100)",

The good: The seafood tofu soup had great flavor but it was seriously the smallest portion I've ever seen in any Korean restaurant.  The original bibimbap was yummy (nothing extraordinary but solid and at least normal portion size).  The chocolate lava cake was delicious.  Warm and gooey.   The not so good: side dishes were icky.  So sad because half the fun of Korean food are the yummy side dishes.  The seafood pancake was tiny and for $9.50, so not worth it.   We are normally huge fans of seafood pancake but just so tiny here (two small silver dollar pancake size ones and at most places you get one the size of a dinner plate).   The pork belly app was so so.    Our waitress was really nice though it took a while to get seated and for someone to come and take our order.    Overall: small portions, pretty good service... But there's gotta be better Korean places in Vegas!",

Wished they swapped my grill mid meal since I got that burned crust on top, but that is minor. Adds flavor.  Easily 5 stars. Recommended for people who feeling food before 1am.

What makes this place good is that the service is attentive and the prices are affordable, especially during their happy hours that run from 3-6pm and 10pm-close. The HH is worth going to if you plan on eating a lot and drink alcohol. I don't drink that much alcohol anymore so when I'm in LV you can catch me here beyond HH.  The variety of the food items is pretty stellar also. I'll admit the value isn't as great as some AYCE Korean places like Gen but the quality is good and taste better than what I've had in LV before going here. The atmosphere is pretty cozy also. I like the hugeness of the booths and the quality of the grill that cooks my food. I highly recommend this place if you are looking to eat off the strip or away from Chinatown.  Plus, they give you a free dessert if you write a review of the place. No, I'm not being bought off my rating with a dessert it really is what I think of the place.  It doesn't hurt that they offer this for new reviews of the restaurant though...nice!  Oh my...I started writing in Yelp again for a dessert.",

    "text": "Pretty good Korean BBQ joint right by UNLV, but not AYCE. They do have a lot of good combo options for 2, and 4 people and higher. They also have a nice selection of appetizers. Chili dumplings were good, chili garlic wings were not good at all - do not order them. On the bright side the server took them off the menu for us, we tried one and it was just not good. (wings were also tiny). For meats the korean prime kalbi had great flavor and texture. The beef tongue could've definitely been sliced thinner to avoid it being so chewy. Brisket and spicy pork were good, pork was pretty spicy. Overall pretty good for Korean BBQ, solid 4 star experience. 4/5",

We ordered a meat meal combo set that was supposed to serve just 2 people but coming in with 3 people, we still couldn't finish all we ordered.

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I don't like Korean barbecue. In fact, I don't like Korean food, other than the occasional tofu house--and by occasional, I mean once a year. But this place swept me off my feet.   We, a party of six, arrived before the restaurant opened at 11:30 a.m. and waited outside for the doors to open. As we stepped in, someone started to set our table with all the side dishes; as soon as we were seated, we started nibbling. These were high-quality side dishes, from the fishcake slices to the kimchi. There was also macaroni salad, pickled cucumbers, etc. All of these items are \"refillable\" upon request.  While the menu includes weekday lunch specials and meal sets (four different options for parties of 2 or 6), we opted to order a la carte so we could get each item we wanted: -Kobe beef carpaccio ($9.95): So good! Thin slices of meat heaven, really. There was enough for each of us to have 2-3 pieces, too, so definitely a generous serving. -Spicy tuna kimbap ($6.95): Kind of like a spicy tuna with crispy rice roll that you'd find at some Izakayas, but the rice is rolled up in seaweed, and the tuna is poke-style. You get the soft fish and the crunchy rice with a light sriracha mayo flavor--comes together very nicely. It's four rolls, but we managed to share between six of us.  -Tteokbokki ($4.95): Consisting of soft rice cake, fishcake (same as the side dish), and hot sauce, this dish took me by surprise. It looks like a simple bowl of rice cakes, but is full of flavor, not awfully spicy. Make sure that you get a fishcake slice with the rice roll to get all the flavors together. A good, cheaper option for something that's a bit more filling. -Spicy ramen egg ($6.95): I was skeptical, but boy was I proved wrong! This was one of the most enjoyable bowls of ramen I've had, even though it really was just ramen, egg, some greens, and spice. Like the tteokbokki, it's simple, but so good for the soul and for the tummy. You can opt for the Japanese sausage/ seafood options for additional cost. -Bibim nangmyun ($11.95): Spicy cold thin noodles. This was my least preferred of all the dishes, but even then, I'd give it a 4/5. Nothing bad about it, just that it's not as savory as it looks, though you can add whatever sauces you want. I'd recommend mixing in some of the spicy fishcake side dish for additional flavor.  -Original bibimbap ($12.95): Our server helped us mix everything together and even dished it out to each of us. Best bibimbap I've had, hands down. Flavorful, filling, and \"healthy\" (because of all the veggies in it, of course). -Beef toro ( 2x$4.95), beef tongue (2x$8.95), flat iron garlic ($8.95), Korean prime kalbi ($8.95): I couldn't really tell the difference between any of them, but it doesn't matter, because they were all so delicious. For the meats that aren't already marinated, definitely use the three sauces provided to you--in fact, I recommend dipping the same piece of meat into all three sauces to get a slightly sweet/ tangy, and definitely spicy kick to your otherwise unflavored meat.   All of this cost only $125--including tax and gratuity! All six of us were extremely stuffed and very happy. Oh, AND with Yelp check-in, we each got a free macaron for dessert... Maybe not the best life choice, but who can turn down a free dessert?",

Bf and I got the Meat Lovers, 2 other friends got the Las Vegas, 2 others got the Gangnam, and 1 friend just ordered apps. I loved the Meat Lovers! Seems pricey but you get sooo much meat! The Las Vegas has chicken if you're not so much into meat. And the Gangnam has fresh oysters, although our friends opted to exchange the oysters for something else. Either option you choose, you get a lot of food. It's super fun to cook and eat while chatting. Everyone was full and happy at the end. The macaroon ice cream is delicious! I recommend it. It's the perfect size dessert after stuffing your face lol If they still have it, check in  and you get one free! (the macaroon).",

This food is so delicious that I'm questioning the physical limitations of my corporeal form. Every single meat we've tried has been tastier than the next, and every bite sends me to this agonizing happy place somewhere between \"I love my friends for showing me this amazing restaurant\" and \"I hate my friends for putting this unreasonable amount of good food in front of me.\"   We bought the Meat Lovers combo for 6. There are 5 of us. The meal comes with enough to feed probably 8. We finished most of it anyway. It was just so good that we wanted to try everything and I have so many regrets for not sampling instead of shoving endless amounts of meat in my face.

But what came out as our favorite meal, that we had to come back for seconds before our flight, is Gangnam. Service is great. Never had to ask servers to refill our water. Food service was quick. We ordered the premium set, and we wanted to substitute other items on the set, and they were easy to talk to and was able to change things no problem. (With a little extra $$ if the substitute's price is more). Every single thing on the set that we got was really good. We really liked the Uni bulgogi. The dish was very buttery and they don't skim on the uni pieces. And if I have to go back to Vegas, a trip to Gangnam asian bbq is a must! Totally loved the free macaron ice cream when you check in on Yelp!",

    "text": "As a night owl and broke college student, I'm really fortunate to live in Vegas where there's no shortage of late night specials in restaurants open past midnight. Gangnam has been my go to for KBBQ cravings since day one with their smashing reverse happy hour deals of meats and apps all $4 and under.  The menu is not AYCE but the quality of meat is substantially better than any AYCE joint around town. From my experience, four grill items, an app, and rice/salad is more than enough food for two people to share. The complimentary banchan is plentiful both in variation and amount they give, and I'm pretty sure they're refillable as well although I've never tried considering how full I get each time. This visit, we left satisfied (and with leftovers!) at under $12 per person plus tip. If that's not a great deal for KBBQ I don't know what is!  Our food came out fast despite the restaurant being packed, with banchan arriving as soon as we put in our order. The toro was fatty, pork belly was thick, and the chicken was marinated to perfection. You can't go wrong with any type of meat you choose. It's all fresh and of high quality, and even the veg is good! Mushroom medley is a personal fave- it comes precooked in a foil pack to place on the grill. The butter base provides a delicious decadence to the umami mushroom flavors.   With consistently good food, good prices, and good service, Gangnam deserves all five stars. If you love KBBQ and have never been here... do you even exist? Kidding, but seriously, you gotta check this place out",

    "text": "Great Korean barbecue. The staff was helpful and friendly. The food was excellent.   For those who have not been, Korean barbecue involves cooking your own meat on a grill at the table. Side items, including miso soup, edame, beans, kimchee, salad, etc., are brought to you.   The side dishes were all good, though the salad is not particularly memorable other than the fact it contained exactly one hard boiled egg and two cherry tomatoes. The miso soup was amazing  While the meat can be ordered a la carte, they do have \"bundles\". The one we chose had items my wife could not eat (she has a severe shellfish allergy). The restaurant happily substituted alternates with the same price from the a la carte menu. All was very good though thinly sliced beef cooks down much smaller than you would expect.   Why four stars? Grills need to be changed fairly frequently as the meat bakes on. Other Korean barbecues change the grill multiple times during a meal. Ours was never changed.   Additionally, the other Korean barbecue places I have been to have been like sushi restaurants -- everything for one price. Not here.  Worth going to? Yes. But caveat emptor with respect to my criticisms.",

We ordered a la carte as we like to have the Kalbi and with 5 type of meat, we came up cheaper than the package they offer. Mainly due to we don't like to have seaweed salad, dumpling and house salad. That's $10 savings there that can go toward the premium meat. We forgot to check in to get the free ice cream. Still regret till now.",

This place is fun and romantic, definitely setting the mood for the amazon night ahead of us. We had the premium combo with Kobe beef, need tongue, shrimp rice bumpy bop or something, among other yummy things. This was my first taste of Kobe beef and I certainly fell in love. The meat is fresh and well as the veggies. I love how you can cook your food perfectly the way you want it.  The staff was very friendly and not very invasive. Always refilling our drinks and occasionally checking on us, making sure we were enjoying our experience.   The price is a little steep, but what do you expect when you order Kobe beef. I would have paid more. I'm sure there are less expensive places in china town but this was close to home.   Over all we had a very good experience, the food was delicious and the staff was very nice. I will be going back.",

I'd suggest to order their korean prime kalbi, brisket, premium beef tongue, kobe style beef, spicy pork, and their filet mignon for meats. They also offer happy hour in which some of the dishes come at a discount that ranges from $2.95-9.95 per tapa order depending on the meats.   Mixxed veggies are a good choice for sides, kimchee, japanese pepper, mushroom, and asparagus. The stuff with the cheese sides aren't really worth it. I wasn't too fond of the whole cheese dipping thing, and didn't end up using it.   For the combos, the first time we came, we ordered the Paradise combo. It says it's good for two people, but we split this with a family of four. We don't eat a lot, but it was still enough to fill us up! Well, we also ordered calamari (which was also good! especially their sauce!) and their fried dumplings (beware. it's really spicy).  This place is pretty hip, they also have a nice private room for a big party. They feature this big projector screen that plays a mixture of popular music videos from here and Korea. The Korean music videos are so fun to watch even if I don't understand the language. It's a good way to help the time pass.   It's a fun hip place to go to, but every time I go it's barely full. Maybe one or two areas are taken.",

I think we ordered the premium combo with a few a la carte.  I can't remember what meat was what, but I can tell you that some were good and some were ok. The biggest problem with this place is service.   The only time they stopped off at our table is to take our order, drop off the food, and give us the check. Never came by to pick up empty plates. Had to scream at them to get their attention for ordering more drinks and water. Never came to refill the side dishes. Never checked on our sauce. You get the picture. They didn't even pretend to care and help start cooking.",

Unlike other Korean spots I've been to, the vibe of this place is decorated nicely and really clean which made me feel even more comfortable with stopping by for some lunch munchies.    Ordered the Meat Lovers meal for 4 people which was $99. They start you out with a nice salad topped with an Italian like dressing. Miso soup is served shortly after. The main entree consisted of Kalbi, Bulgogi, Pork belly, Spicy pork, and the only meat i was really craving on the menu, Filet mignon! Unfortunately it was also the only meat that turned out bad with whatever marinade they used. On the another note, we had reached our belly limits. The meal filled us all perfectly with a little desert room to spare.  Our server was great, and he was very consistent with checking up on us. Then again, there were only a few tables being occupied at the time Lol.",

We came here during happy hour but judging from the menu, the price would've still been great even if we didn't. The meat paired with the sauce was perfect. You also get a free macaroon ice cream if you check in on yelp and the ice cream was SO good! My boyfriend devoured it in seconds.",

We have tried Gyu-kak uin Chicago several times. I have to say these two are pretty similar. However you can't have a good meal in Gyu-kaku with this price.  Recommendation: 1) meat: prime kalbi ; pork belly; beef toro 2) all sides are good 3) seaweed salad and miso soup 4) bibim nangmyun  5) Tteokbokki (my fav) Japche seems good too, maybe try next time.  In words, you must try this. Love it.",

The interior had a modern cultural vibe, making the experience feel relaxing. Although this Japanese Korean BBQ does not offer AYCE, the combos are reasonably priced for the amount of food included! We got the Meat Lovers combo for about $60, my faves were the dumplings, beef toro and of course filet mignon. The servers were all friendly and comes by to change the grille if it becomes too burnt. We flew back home with more than a happy tummy!",

    "text": "Korean BBQ!  During the whole trip in Vegas, my friend and I didn't eat anything good.  So for our last dinner there, we had to find a good restaurant to eat at.  We found this place on yelp and it was a good choice.  They are located just outside the strip.  They are opened till late as well.  When we got there, there was a wait.  We were told 30-45 minutes wait.  It wasn't too bad so we decided to wait.  An hour and half passed by and we were still waiting.  My friend went to the host to check up.  They told her the table to should be ready in a bit.  We finally got a table and things got better.  We ordered the Las Vegas meal.  Which is a good portion for 2 or even 3.  Depending upon how much a person can intake of course.  Each person gets 3 different dipping sauces.  I don't know what they were but all were good.  I alternated between each one.  The options for rice were either 2 steamed rice or 1 bibimbap.  We got the bibimbap.  I think it was a good choice.  The rice was on the softer side but it was flavorful.  Had bulgogi and veggies.  Side dishes were nothing to rave about.  Just normal like other Korean restaurants.  Everything else that came with this meal were all good.  Omg, my friend and I overstuffed ourselves.  We tried to finish everything but we couldn't.  One bad thing about eating Korean bbq is that you will smell like the food afterwards.  It may not be a good idea to go anywhere after lol.  Overall, this is a good restaurant to eat at.  The wait is like average for Vegas for the most part.  Happy grilling!",

The first time we came was on a Monday at 7 and the wait was already up to 40 minutes. We decided to try again on the weekend. We then came back on a Saturday at 4:30 and there was NO wait - and we were in time for happy hour. If you can time your visit around it, I recommend it.   They have lots of different meats so here's what we ordered: Duck Breast - yummy! Would get again  Short Rib - So good - shoulda gotten more.  Pork Belly - I liked it but husband was just so-so Beef Toro - Husband likes this. I thought it was too thin and a pain to cook.  Calamari - Tricky to cook. Would not get again.  Tofu - Also tricky to cook and kept burning. I'd pass.  Bacon wrapped Enoki - Not bad but would probably skip next time.  Mushroom medley - I was underwhelmed but husband loves mushrooms so he was content. It's already precooked which I was bummed about.  Broccoli - Also precooked. I thought we'd get to grill it. Ahh well.  House Salad - Not bad but nothing like the picture.   So overall I'd stick to more beef next time although it was fun to try different things.   The service was just okay. It took a while for people to help us both days and we weren't really given instructions on how to cook. When we asked, some staff didn't know.   This is worth trying once. I wouldn't make this a regular thing since it gets pricey in a hurry.",

Unlike other Korean bbq restaurants I've been to, this one does not offer unlimited choices of meat for the price you pay, but you still get plenty of food for half the cost which for me is a win! We came during the happy hour which allowed for great pricing on the meat choices and appetizers. With great food, great service and a free dessert for $35 for 2 people, I cannot complain about this place! Highly recommend when visiting LV!",

    "text": "Originally our party was supposed to have a dinner at Shang Artisan Noodle, but the police blocked the entire plaza and we were not able to get in. In hindsight if one of our friends actually comes with us a hour earlier then it is possible we would all get stuck in a potential horrific situation. Anyhow I quickly checked my bookmarks on Yelp and picked Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining as our alternative dinner option. The wait was so long (about 45 minutes) that I even had time to chat with a complete random stranger about foods in LA as well as various career advice.  This is NOT an AYCE (all you can eat) Korean BBQ restaurant, but there are four different combos (with 2, 4, and 6 people options available) - Las Vegas ($48.95 for 2 people), Meat Lover ($58.95 for 2 people), Gangnam (#1 best seller; $68.95 for 2 people), and Premium (best cuts; $89.95 for 2 people.) My friends had zero interest in getting the Gangnam combo because they had buffet earlier today and didn't want any starters. As a compromise, we ordered from the a la carte menu and got all meat options from the Gangnam combo instead (meat only for $44.40 vs meat + oyster + sweet corn + shishito pepper + green salad + bibimbap + miso soup for $68.95).  We all got three dipping sauces (one was definitely sweet soy sauce) and our waitress was very good at changing our grills. She kept giving us a new grill each time we finished cooking a meat plate. I counted and it happened at least 4+ times!  [Complimentary banchan]: Squid had great flavors, but it tasted slightly too spicy and flavors were somewhat overwhelming. The sweet sauce on cucumber was good and kimchi tasted more sour and less sweet. Fish cake had fairy firm texture and flavors were there, but quality was just a-okay. Lastly bean sprout was pretty average.  *** Orders ***  Filet Mignon ($9.50): A-okay meat.  Prime Kalbi Chuck ($9.50): Juicy and chewy - very good meat.  Harami Miso ($9.95): Another juicy and chewy meat. Another thumbs-up!  Gulgogi ($5.50): Sauce tasted slightly too sweet, otherwise meat quality was excellent. It was not as good as Harami Miso.  Korean Prime Kalbi ($9.95): Sauce tasted slightly too strong, but good meat quality.  **  Please do not forget to use the Yelp check-in offer because you will get a free Brick macaroon ice cream! Trust me you will want to get it because it tasted surprisingly good! The green tea macaroon ice cream didn't taste too sweet and macaroon certainly had a nice fluffy texture.  A solid 4.5-star on meat quality and flavors - round up to 5-star due to excellent service and free Brick macaroon ice creams!",

We put in our egg order with 1 male server.  It was over 40 minutes and we still didn't get the egg.  We had to remind them again and they said it would take another 10 minutes.

It's off the strip btw so you'll need to drive or take taxi/uber/lyft. We got there around 7:30pm and we put our names down. We waited roughly 45 minutes to hour. It didn't seem that packed when we got there but I guess people put their names and came back to walk around. I was getting super hungry and the smell of the food made even hungrier. We got seated in the back room and it was some-what quiet which was nice but the one thing that kind of sucked was that it was hard to get the waiters attention since not many come by so I had to get up and find someone. Anyways, this place is NOT an AYCE but they have set menus that you can pick from and we ordered the Gangam set. For two people, it is a lot of food so it is almost like an AYCE to me. There was tons of meat (kalbi, bulgogi, pork belly, toro and veggies). All meats were very juicy and marinated well so you don't really need to use the sauces that they provide. The sauces all tasted a bit salty to me so I don't recommend the sauces to be honest. Other than, the food was amazing, service wasn't bad and pricing wasn't too bad ($60 for two people). I'll try some other menu next time I'm in town!",

A little touch of personalization with the menu items.   Definitely worth the price you pay.  Staff sometimes are a little more focused on themselves than the customers BUT are always ready upon request and very accommodating.",

We ordered the green tea mango cheese cake with mango ice cream for dessert. The portions we're small but we weren't very hungry and we're full. Our bill was $35.

It is centrally located so it is perfect for anyone looking for a good BBQ place. Even though there were only two servers tonight they did a pretty good job overall. It started to get packed as the evening went on so I knew that this place was good. I tried a lot of things actually: prime kalbi, bulgogi, pork belly, oysters, miso soup, and even dessert. I wish I could have tried everything but I will save that for the next time I will be there. I even have a feeling that the owner/manager was out and about seating customers, smiling, and making people feel comfortable and right at home. To top it off, they have a projector screen on the wall to provide a little entertainment while you are cooking or enjoying your food. My server, Kristin, was very nice, polite, and outgoing. She really took care of me, always asked if everything was okay, and making sure I was never thirsty. How can you get better than that? I would recommend Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining to anyone who wishes to have great food, great service, and very reasonable prices.",

    "text": "I recently went here for a birthday dinner. We arrived around 5PM and the restaurant was only maybe 1/3 full.  We decided to order the Gangnam special for 4 people. The meal included salad, raw oysters, shishito peppers, corn, mushrooms, miso soup, several kinds of meat, and bulgogi bibimbop. There was also the standard kimchi and other appetizers you get at almost every Korean restaurant. We were there for Happy Hour so we also got a pitcher of beer for half-off.  Overall, everything tasted fairly standard to me. Nothing really stood out as amazing. I felt the salad lacked much flavor at all and the miso was just standard miso. The bibimbap had no chili paste or veggies and was pre-made when it arrived. It was more like just straight Korea style fried rice with some bulgogi inside.  I guess having been to Korea, nothing ever is quite the same; however, I have had other places that are much better than Gangnam.   My biggest issue with the place was the speed in which they serve you. It was way too fast! Within minutes of ordering you have everything you ordered on the table. We didn't have time to finish a single appetizer before the next thing came out. At one point our table was so full there was literally zero room for anything else. I really felt like they were just trying to rush us out.   I have to say that I don't think I will return here next time I am in Vegas.",

I started with the dynamite shrimp and the calamari as appetizers. My main course was the meat lovers combo for two. The portions were too much for me and my date and we love to eat!   Our server was wonderful and patient with us since it was our first time.   We were pleased with everything.  Las Vegas hidden gem",

We had 10-11 people and they gave a huge portion that was able to fill us up with only $20-22? each. THe reason why it's more like a 3.5 is because the quality meat is only okay. It really could be better but of course it's still better than your typical AYCE bbq. I actually think the meal went from great to good. Their appetizers( the little small dishes that korean places serve were great and we got soup, bibimbap(which I thought was really good and flavorful). They also had their happy hour from like 9-close? or something like that but i have to say the meat(pork belly + beef toro) weren't great all even though it was the happy hour price.   Regardless, I think for a bbq place like this, they give you a great portion for a good price is the reason why I gave it a 4. It's not the best non-AYCE place but their set meals are nice and worth it.",

We got there at 5:30pm, so it was HAPPY HOUR. We got corn, broccoli, dumplings, wontons, bulgogi, rice, spicy garlic edamame and all the kimchi sides. It was all good. Was it the best I've ever had? No. But we really enjoyed it anyways. The wontons are all cream cheese and the sweet and sour sauce is watery. That's my only complaint about the food. The service was friendly and quick. Next time we will try a dessert, for sure!  Edited to add: we still love coming here for happy hour, but I was disappointed by the portions tonight. Our macaroni salad was dry and very small. We ordered and paid for two orders of bulgogi and only got one. When we mentioned it, the server said, \"our bulgogi portions are small. Hmmm... we have been here at least ten times over the past three years and never got that little. It left a bad taste in my mouth.",

We've had dinner here twice, and ordered the Meat Lover's with an order of Japchae and Kabocha Tempura.  The cuts of the meat is superb, and we liked that all the meat was seasoned perfectly and quite tasty.  Japchae was solid as was the tempura.  Although it's not AYCE, we left super stuffed and satisfied.  Service was good, they worked as a team, so our glasses and banchan requests we're always attended to.  Wait times vary as our first time, we went on a Thursday at about 7:30pm and waited 30-minutes, and the last time was on a Saturday at 9pm with no wait.  I just wish they had better seating, than the wooden benches they have which are uncomfortable, then again, it's probably on purpose so people wouldn't linger.  #LVKBBQ",

We happened to arrive during their happy hour, and we were greeted promptly.  Clean, classy atmosphere.  The music is a mix of top 40 and big Kpop hits.  Service is prompt and courteous.  Nothing really noteworthy up to this point.  Then the food arrives -- everything was well-seasoned and good quality.  The meat we ordered was never chewy, a welcome change from Tofu Hut.  Their prime kalbi was surprisingly marbled, definitely my top pick of the evening, followed by the green tea/mango cheesecake for dessert.  If you're looking for tapas-style Korean BBQ, Gangnam certainly makes the grade.",

You cook the meat yourself at the table. Overall, lunch was really good, and the high rating is real. We ended up getting desert, but not the one offered free for this review.",

The decor was lovely; dark (and blessedly cool!) and nicely appointed. Seats were very comfortable. I had never seen the bbq trays on the table before.  Fortunately, my co-worker knew what to order, and she made some recommendations that were just fantastic. I had bulgogi (pork) with a mushroom medley that was absolutely delicious. The portions were very generous, too. It was fun cooking the food on the little bbqs. Service was a bit slow, but the poor waitress was having problems with their cash register; she apologized and explained what the issue was, so we were forgiving of the situation. The lunch special was very reasonable, considering the amount of food we received and the quality of it. We were extremely happy campers when we left and went back to the conference. I told myself that next time I go to Vegas, I will *definitely* be back to eat here.  BUT.... the REAL gem of this experience occurred two weeks later, when I got back to work and submitted my receipts. I had misplaced the credit card receipt (still had the itemized one) and my work was on my back bugging me for the credit card receipt. I contacted the restaurant with my pathetic request and the gentleman who answered the phone was very understanding, and sent me a reprint that satisfied the dragons in Accounting. So... GREAT food, outstanding portions, good value for the money - and EXCEPTIONAL customer service. Gangnam, I hope you open a restaurant in Ventura, California someday!! I will definitely be back to visit!!",

The best part is it costs only 59.95! I especially love their fresh oyster, Korean Prime Kalbi, and Bulgogi Bibimbap. That Bibimbap was a bomb, it's the best I've ever had.

At a table with four of us in total, we ordered the following:  Steamed chili dumplings Peach saketini Fried meat dumplings Miso soup         Fried calamari w/spicy sauce Fresh oysters Prime kalbi (short rib without bone) Beef Toro (brisket)  Kobe style beef Salmon Basil Green tea cheesecake  You can also either choose to grill the food yourself or ask your server to have it cooked before bringing it to your table.",

The raw oysters didn't have the seafood after taste at all and went down smooth. The appetizers came out quickly and they keep giving you more if you ask for it.  Service was excellent. The staff is attentive and friendly.   Ambiance is chill. It's like most of the other Korean restaurants I've been to with kpop music in the background and they're willing to turn on sports for you if you request it. Overall a satisfying meal and experience.",

There are both booths and regular tables that fit up to 6 people. The tables are a little wide for my taste, since it puts a big distance between customers sitting across from each other, but over all, it is a comfortable setting.   My friend and I came in during happy hour. We ordered $16 worth of food, which was more than enough for us. The meat was top-notch quality, and I actually liked all of the the sauces they have here. The side dishes were plentiful. As always, I loved the fish cake.   The service was fast, attentive, and efficient. I will definitely be back here for Korean BBQ, even though they are not all-you-can-eat.",

We weren't sure what to order, so we chose the best sellers or ones that were recommended. My favorite was the chicken with lemon sauce, and either the #1 or #2...can't remember which one was which anymore :(. The salmon carpaccio was really good too! It's pretty much salmon sashimi with ponzu sauce. We also liked the japchae...very flavorful and full of assorted veggies.   The filet mignon was tough and chewy so we didn't' enjoy it as much. The spicy tuna kimbap was okay...there was too much rice for me. I didn't realize it's just spicy tuna over deep fried rice. We also ordered the yuzu soju, but it tasted watered down. I was kind of skeptical because the menu shows that its yellow...but the one we got was clear (like the lemon soju)  I would definitely come again if I was in Vegas. Our hotel was on the strip, so the cab ride was only about 15 minutes...I think it cost around $13-16.",

The food was reasonably priced. We got the gangnam special for $65 for two people. Well worth the money if you're going to eat everything. I do mean everything. Otherwise I would have ordered a la carte. All the meat was seasoned and marinated very well that you didn't really need the additional bbq sauce that they offered. We also ordered the steamed chili dumplings..... Don't get those. It's a big dose of spicy sauce with otherwise bland flavors.   We'd definitely come back only if we felt like splurging. After dessert, drinks and taxes, $90+ is a bit more than we'd like for a quick casual meal.",

The corn is bad.  The steamed egg isn't good.  Food wise probably 2-3 stars.  What is horrible is the service and attitude of the servers.  We came for lunch and weren't given lunch special menus.  When I asked for the menu, the attitude started.  We didn't end up ordering the lunch special, but not one smile or happy service for the entire meal.  Each request was met with a grumpy grunt.  They don't refill side dishes without being asked like good korean restaurant experiences.  They don't see a utensil falling to the ground in front of their face and move to address it.  They don't move out of the way when you are trying to walk down the aisle to the restroom.  Terrible service will ruin decent food everytime.",

We have tried many high end restaurants while here in Vegas over the years and have found most are expensive, over rated and at times , leaving still hungry. This place is a gem. Due to reading about the waiting time being long in the early hours ( 6pm to 9pm ) , we waited to 10:30pm to show up and just walked in and were seated. What was even better was that it was reverse happy hour and the already great prices were even cheaper for food and drinks. As in most posts, found that the service was excellent and prompt. They have the team effort approach so the whole staff was either bring or picking up something regularly. The food was the bomb! Fresh and tasty. The flat iron garlic and bulgogi was great. We ordered the meat lovers combo and it was quite the spread for 2 people and you won't leave hungry. Also great place to go if you want to talk with your date, significant other and family and not have everyone on their phones looking at the internet constantly because their cooking , chatting and having fun!!!

In terms of food, however, Gangnam is more Korean influenced, and the meat quality here is far better than Gyu's. They also provide banchan here, and the kimchi was really good! Kimchi Gangnam style!!   My buddy and I ordered pork off the lunch set menu (looked like pork shoulder), and it was really chewy for me at first (even though it was fully cooked). But I started to enjoy the texture the more and more I ate it. It was better than the actual pork belly in my opinion. The beef toro was pretty good, and its cuts were thick.   We also tried the chicken wings, steamed dumplings, and the spicy tuna kimbap. The chicken wings were tasty and flavorful. There was too much going on in the spicy tuna kimbap, and it was too sauce heavy. The steamed dumplings were just not very good, and even my buddy said that they tasted like packaged ones.   Not sure if this place is worthy of their 4.5 star rating. I wasn't impressed by anything, but maybe I'll give it another shot if I'm in the area.",

Pleasantly surprised by the customer service. Not alot of employee but somehow very attentive with every table. Since there was a wide variety of choices on the menu, the waiter was really informative of the sauces and questions we had about the menu.  Along with good service, the food quality was pretty good. The side dishes included fish cake, macaroni salad, red sauced squid, kimchi, bean sprouts, and pickled cucumber. Pretty standard.   For a party of 5, we ordered: -chicken salad: random but good, comes with a honey mustard dressing -tempura udon: standard -house salad:  -kimchi chigae As for meats -Korean prime kalbi -premium tounge -bulgogi  Overall will be back next time im in town- perfect for family gatherings and a place to relax. I recommend the meats.",

We ordered 4 happy hour menus, Fried calamari ($4), Chicken Karage($4), Spicy Chicken BBQ with Lemon Source($3), Korean Chicken BBQ Cheese Fondue($3) and Filet Mignon ($8.5) and Sukiyaki, all delicious! Every menu was much bigger portion than we expected, plus endless refillable free 8 side dishes come with meal!  We were sooooo stuffed.  They give you 3 kinds of dipping sauce for the meat besides lemon sauce and cheese we ordered, all tasted excellent. Beer was a half price during happy hour. For all the above tasty meal plus beer, the total was only $37 including tax. Unbelievable!!! We'll come back again! 1-2!3-637",

The service was fantastic and we had interactions with multiple employees through the meal. This time we ordered apps from happy hour including the edamame and jalapeno poppers. So good and such a value!  On the grill we bbq'd the ribeye with Their own sweet Korean sauce first (on happy hour)!  That toasted the grill up with some flavor before adding filet, duck, scallops, and bacon wrapped Udon mushrooms. Everything caramelized and cooked perfectly. All we added was some garlic butter which toasted nicely on the grill in very thin slices. Topped the night off with a macaroon to share. Strawberry was very good. Such a great value and experience!!",

Ordered cream cheese wonton, mushroom medly, jalapeno poppers, calamari, pork belly, beef toro, spicy pork and Korean chicken cheese fondue.  Cream cheese wonton: All it was is wonton wrapper with literally only cream cheese inside, fried and served with sweet sauce. Pretty bland and disappointing. 1/5  Mushroom medly: Just different types of mushrooms that was mixed with melted butter. 2/5  Jalapeno poppers: Pop of deliciousness! Jalapeno sliced in half stuffed with cream cheese and crab and deep friend drizzle with sweet dressing. 5/5  Calamari: Crispy calamari with the spicy mayo dip sauce, average. 3/5  Pork belly: So good, you can never go wrong with pork belly. Slapped this on the grill and once crispy on both sides... With rice it's amazing. 5/5  Beef toro: Basically brisket... My friend enjoyed this very much. 4/5  Spicy pork: Meh 2/5  Chicken cheese fondue: Grilled the chicken and cheese however once dipped into cheese it was way chunky and not good. Aye the chicken alone. 1/5  Overall the food was ok, but I prefer Korean BBQ at tofu hut. The dipping sauces don't really stand out to me, one was sweet and one  is spicy... But I still love my sesame dipping sauce at tofu hut. The quality of meat is better but as far as the taste, tofu hut is way better. I didn't know during happy hour they don't give you rice? I had to ask for rice for both of us, but my server only came back with one bowl of rice... So we split the rice.   Overall, this place is good... My first time trying Japanese BBQ.",

    "text": "Wow!  Being accustomed to the LA scene, I was very impressed with the Korean food here at Gangnam.  Unlike most of the customers, I am reviewing the items NOT from the set menu.    I had the Uni Sukiyaki, which was scrumptiously creamy!  They mix the uni and the udon noodles in front of you in a hot stone pot.  It is a must try!  I also had the beef tongue with green onion, which was super yummy with raw garlic!  I am not too sure about how this dish is different than the premium beef tongue, but I think it is a slightly smaller portion.  There are a few different sauces that you could use for dipping, which was placed in front of me: bean flavored, oil and salt, soy, etc.  There was also the typical banchan: kimchee, cucumber, bean sprouts, macaroni smothered in mayonnaise, raddish.   At least, this was all I could remember.  The wine menu was your typical red, whites, roses, sparkling, etc. Finally, the free macaroon offered on the Yelp check in was just delicious!  Flavors included green tea, mango, strawberry, and a few others.    Ambience was modern and non-pretentious.  Servers are very nice.  I sat at the bar, where there was a huge screen TV in front of me.  Overall, I was very happy I chose to come here.  Yelpers were very accurate in rating this one.  Thank you for a great dining experience!",

    "text": "Came here with my boyfriend and his brother. WThis Korean BBQ Restaurant is Al La Carte,  NOT AYCE. You order plates of meat, each with their own cost (some can be very pricey, while others are more reasonable). You can also order cheese corn, tofu soup, and other dishes. We thought about ordering a combo package that comes with different appetizers and certain meats.  We decided not to and instead ordered meats that we wanted and a pitcher of beer. The quality of meat was amazing! I was not disappointed with any selection. I think it came out to about $20.00 per person which is quite reasonable. We were completely satisfied with our meal which is super nice compared to going to an AYCE place and you feel like you just might explode. We loved the spicy pork, brisket, bulgogi, and the galbi. Which basically means we loved all of it. If you want to splurge, then you can order premium meats too, but personally am so satisfied with the basic meats which are more than enough. The dipping sauces are really good too, but I have no idea what I'm eating. I also really like the soybean paste which is a bit salty and barely spicy. It costs extra for some lettuce leaves, but it serves as a really good balance to your meat.  If it's your first time, try this:  1. Rip a piece of lettuce off (about 1/3) 2. Take some soy bean paste and put it on your lettuce 3. Dip your brisket (or other meat) into the different sauces 4. Place the meat in your lettuce and wrap it (like a taco) 5. AND ENJOY!  The marinated meats are better by themselves or with rice. My boyfriend always gets rice, so I just stole a small amount of his. Some of the free side dishes were really good! I liked adding some kimchi to my \"mini tacos\" too. Also, IF YOU CHECK IN, YOU GET A FREE MACAROON ICE CREAM SANDWICH. :) Yay Yelp!",

Their 6 person set dinner can easily feed 8 adults.  The staff here are very friendly and even though it's a fast pace environment yet staff remain professional and very accommodating.   Their Soju was very good too, so good that almost all the adult in our group had one.  Their meat quality is top notch and you get large portions. Oysters were fresh along with their seafood. Their filet cubes was one of the best I've had. If anything the only one that we didn't like was the marinated meat. it wasn't anything spectacular but nonetheless it was still good. The salad was very refreshing and put a good balance with the meat.   If you come here, go for the set dinner and order less than you need. If you have six order the 4 person set dinner and get a few appetizers.   Make sure you check in on Yelp as they will give you a free macaroon ice cream sandwich on your way out!",

The macaroon (free with yelp check-in) was excellent.  The Bad:  The banchan selection was on the slim side. Yes, they give you whatever you ask for, however, there was not too much variety beyond the 6 or so side dishes offered.   The spicy tofu soup was bland and tasteless.   You come out smelling like the joint.  I don't know if its poor ventilation, or that they don't change out the grills, the place, as well as your clothes will smell like Korean BBQ afterwards (more than anywhere else). This place is NOT an AYCE.  I knew this to begin with, however, it just felt wierd.  We probably would have paid less at an AYCE place.  I wanted to like this place more, however, it didn't seem to any better than any other AYCE Korean BBQ in Las Vegas.",

If you are wondering why this restaurant have so many reviews and high ratings this might answer your question. (See photo) Yes, for every review you write on yelp, you get a free dessert and the server screens your review. \"You must show posted review to your server.\" After seeing the so-called \"Limited Time Offer\" poster (placed on every table) I felt cheated by yelp. I always use yelp for honest reviews, not reviews that have been somehow influenced and manipulated by the restaurant. It's one thing to give people discounts on their bill if they check-in with yelp, but it's another thing to bribe people with dessert and screen their reviews. My utmost disappointment to the unethical promotional strategy this restaurant uses.  Never coming here again.",

Corn cheese - yummy with rice  We also ordered kalbi, Kobe beef, bugogi, filet mignonette, steAm egg, and the uni....nothing to rave home to mom about. The meat was flavorless and not really tender. My suggestion is to save your KBBQ fix for AYCE at LA in Korea town or hit up Han II Kwan in SF. Now, Those spots are places you should rave to mom about.   Almost forgot, we did the check in on yelp for the macaroon ice cream. The macaroon was a bit on the stale side.",

I've had these pancakes at several places in several cities, including my mom's house (I'm korean) and it always has a dipping sauce with it.

The BBQ prices are super reasonable - between $4-10 for most items. We ordered a bunch of items but our favorites were the marinated kalbi, beef toro, and beef tongue. They also give lots of complimentary sauces (ponzu, sweet soy, spicy soy, bean curd, sesame, salt) and you can ask for complimentary dipping cheese fondue and garlic butter.  We were all super full and the bill came out to $15pp after tax and tip! I was impressed by the value.  You can also check in on Yelp and get a free macaron ice cream if you spent over $15pp. They have a variety of flavors including mango, green tea, and vanilla. It was a nice sweet treat to end the meal!",

The place is on the cozier side and since it's popular be expected to wait for at least 20 mins during cocktail/ dinner time 6:30-8   Their happy hour is 3-6 I believe and it's a great deal! Have been here during HH and for 3 of us drinks included 50 bucks!  Without happy hour and ordering about the same it came out to 75! None the less still a really good deal  The food is so amazing and authentic you can tell it's a family owned shop all their food is so delicious! I love how they bring out little snacks for you while you order drinks my favorite is their squid and the Mac!  The meats are super good for the thin cuts the best are the bulgogi and we like the marinated ones! They also have super good chicken and salmon too! This place is perfect for a group of friends to cook your own food and have a great night!",

The service is friendly and the food comes out pretty quickly once you order. They have your normal cuts of meat including chicken, beef, pork, and seafood as well as some higher quality cuts of beef that you can order as well. Anything you get here is tasty and you get to cook it yourself!  The location is just on the edge of the strip and has a large parking lot because it is in a plaza so you don't need to worry about paying for parking.  I'd recommend this place because it's affordable and has a welcoming atmosphere.",

The flavors were perfect and not too spicy.  When it got too spicy i would just eat some ban chan. My favorite was the cucumber kimchee and bean sprouts.  I've had a lot of different chigae but this is one that is on my top list.  Six ban chans give and I'm sure they would refill it.   Service was okay and nothing really stood out. The mule i ordered was also a bit weak.. overall a great place to dine at if you Korean BBQ or other favorites like Bibimbap.",

Staff was friendly and attentive, and the food was excellent.  One of the things we appreciated was that we were able to order the dinner for two, despite our larger party.  An AYCE-format restaurant would not have permitted this.  We added on a couple happy hour food items and the food quantity was more than enough.  One thing I missed from other korean BBQ places was the dipping oils with the salt at the bottom.  They gave each diner a three-sectioned dipping sauce variety bowl and the sauces in them were fine, just not the salted oils I was hoping for.  Our dinner experience here was very positive and we would gladly return.",

It's off of Paradise and Harmon, just across the way from the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino (in the same area as the CVS).  We had to call because we didn't see a sign  in the advertisement section, but it's there!    When we arrived it was happy hour.  Their happy hour beer was INSANE!  We paid $8.50 for a pitcher of beer!  $8.50!!!  Our server was so awesome!  Since this was our first time here she helped us figure out what we wanted on the menu AND also helped with putting the meat on the grill and letting us know when it was ready.  This was probably one of the most reasonably priced and filling meals we had in Vegas!  They're meal for two combos are huge!  Don't be afraid to ask for their help (cooking or picking something to eat), everyone is really nice!  The ambiance is really good too! When we were on our way out there was a bit of a line, so I definitely recommend calling ahead and making some sort of reservation.  If you're trying to walk to this place from the strip and it's well over 100 degrees, reconsider!  There isn't much shade, the sidewalk is narrow and it isn't worth it!  I learned the hard way lol!   We will definitely be back!",

We prefer to get the Gangnam combination (it is on their menu as an option).  This option allows you to get a serving of multiple items on the menu at a great price point.  I like it because this allows us to find out what we really like before we go again next time :)  Our favorites are the Kobe beef, bulgogi, all of the sides, house salad, fried calamari and miso soup.  I could go on for days about how delicious this food is, but the more I type the more I want to book a flight to Vegas and go eat one of those delicious bites of food.  Oh, and don't miss the check-in offer for a FREE MACAROON!!!! Who could be mad at a free adorable (not to mention delicious!) cookie and ice cream sandwich?!  Hurry, come eat here!!!!",

We ordered the Gangham Special which is their most popular combo. It had a bunch of different appetizers including miso soup and salad. Then they brought out a serious assortment of choice meats and each was delicious in their own way. We didn't want it to end. However, the next morning we all had gurgle guts to varying degrees. My tummy was just a bit upset but another guy spent the morning in the little boys room. Seeing as how we were the ones cooking our own meat maybe we had no one to blame but ourselves. Or maybe the meat wasn't as fresh as it appeared. The world may never know.",

I asked for an explanation of the combination meals and all he said was \"the meat lovers is our most popular\" even though the menu says the Gangnam is the most popular. I inquired about the Gangnam meal and again he said the meat lovers is what we should get. So we ordered the meat lovers for four.  When the food arrived he put it on the table and started to walk away. I asked him what we do with the food and he pointed out the beef and pork dishes and the only instruction was \"cook the pork well done\" and he walked away.  We each started taking a piece of meat and cooking it and eating it which took a long time. After watching some other tables it was clear we should have cooked lots of food at one time.  While they do have vents, we left not really satisfied and smelling like grilled meat.  Was not bad but definitely not something we'll do again in Vegas.",

    "text": "So I meet up the homie Mike C. at this place. Been wanting to try it for a minute now. It's eveningish and not busy at all.  It has a nice, dark, and clean ambiance. I'm not too sure on the dynamics of this establishment. We were the ones manning the grill, which I had no problem with. I've had places where an angry looking Korean lady snatches the tongs away and takes over. It wasn't the usual AYCE but I'll still pho'ks with it.   The dishes we sampled was the carpaccio, pork belly, brisket, filet mignon, and prime kalbi.  I saw on Yelp that this place had beef carpaccio. Ever since Woonam Jung stopped serving carpaccio, I've been looking for another joint to replace that empty spot in my heart. Gangnam's carpaccio wasn't as extravagant as Woonam's, but just as good. Served on an oily sauce and some greens on top. Simple and delicious. This was my favorite during the feeding.  The pork belly and brisket. What can you say? It's always good. There is nothing special about these other than the pork belly being thick. Dip them things in the sesame -salt & pepper concoction and you got a happy customer.   ALRIGHTY THEN!  Now to the beef. The filet mignon was good and tender. We cooked it quickly to a nice medium rare. It was perfect! Again, I'm glad we were manning the grill. These could have easily been over cooked and ruined. We actually got another order of the filet mignon. The server finally brings in the prime kalbi. He says that this is their signature dish. It was very tender and sweet, but it didn't leave an everlasting impression with my palate. Would I still pho'ks with it?  Sure. The first four orders is a definate though. So in the end, the crack that will have me on the come back is the carpaccio and the filet mignon. WINNER!  Yay!, I'm a fan!!!",

And that's just soybeans, I'm not even talking about the awesome meat! We chose the brisket, the filet mignon, the pork belly, just about anything and everything; all were delicious! All decently priced. They give you 3 different sauces to dip your protein in- there's like a ponzu tangy one, a house special one, and a spicier version of the house special- which I preferred- cause I loooove spicy. Only thing that was so-so for me was their steamed egg. It's one of my favorite things to eat when I go out to eat Korean BBQ and I was just a little disappointed considering everything else was so good. But if anything try some of their gyoza. Deeeeee freakin licious! Service was good and the room we got was pretty awesome. I'll be back for sure.",

The second time I had to drag my friends along as they were dead-set on staying on the strip and eating overpriced food in a snooty environment. They were grumbling through the ordering process, but once they got their Soju and the food started arriving, they were all instantly converted! We had a fantastic experience - such a wonderful restaurant!",

Great place to be in outside of the strip and away from the touristiness( but what isnt not toursity in Vegas?)  We ordered the gangnam set, beef toro, pork toro and pork belly. Side dishes were great, my favorite was the macaroni! Meat quality was actually pretty good, might be better than some of the kbbq places in LA. Personally, I like it more than Honey pig and Quarters in LA! Also wayyyyyyy better than all those AYCE places. The service was great too! Price wasnt too much as well. Would recommend to revisit!",

The restaurant was freezing cold, the service was awful, the food wasn't very good, and to top it off the server gave us some other person's credit card and ran away before we could tell her it wasn't ours! In no way is that ok. I will never go back to this restaurant again.   When we got there we were greeted with the most unfriendliest server I have ever seen. She made us feel very unwelcome and as if we did something wrong by coming into the restaurant.   After we were seated we were ignored for a bit. She never asked us if we had been there before or explained anything to us. After we ordered she gave us some kind of sauce and some side dishes. There was no explanation as to what any of it was. We tried 5 of the 7 side dishes and only one of them tasted like anything and that was cucumber. They were not good and the 2 we didn't try looked really unappetizing.   When the meat came out again no explanation about how to handle and cook the raw meat so that there is no cross contamination or cooking times to make sure the meat is cooked properly so that we don get food poisoning. Ever other restaurant that has you cook your own meat that I have been to tells you these things. The meat was alright. It was nothing special. For the amount of stars and reviews this restaurant has I expected something better than mediocre.    When we were finished we had to wait at least 15 minutes to get the check. We noticed that the server kept looking at us but was trying to ignore us. The table next to us who sat down while we were eating got their check before we did. We finally got the check and gave them our card. The sever then brought back the card and basically threw it on the corner of the table and ran away. She had actually  given us the wrong credit card. She ran away so fast we couldn't give it back. Luckily a tall skinny male server came an took it and brought our card.",

    "text": "I have tried many Korean BBQ places and I have to say this restaurant stands out the most! I have heard so many good things about Gangnam Asian BBQ and finally gave it a try tonight. The ambiance of the interior was really intimate and it was very clean. It really sets the mood for dates or whenever you're in the mood for binge eating KBBQ with your friends, which is what I did.   The food was delicious! The meats were served fresh and presented nicely. What came to my surprise was that they served Thai Tea, which made my visit even more satisfying. We ordered the miso soup, pork belly, prime kalbi, bugolgi, the bacon wrapped enoki just to name a few and Yuuum! Belly was satisfied! What adds variety of flavor to your meat is the three different sauces they present you with. There is a vinegar like sauce, a sweet sauce, and a spicy sauce, which really gives you multiple choice on flavorings for your food.Of course trying their desserts was a must so I went for the banana tempura. This was so goood. The banana tempura was served hot off the frying pan and what helped balanced that out was the vanilla ice cream. It was a great ending to my meal. The prices overall are perfect for what they serve you.  All in all I have to say my visit was great! The owner even came out and checked on us. He was so friendly and he looked happy to see his customers. I will be coming back for more!",

    "text": "Updated review:  We celebrated my sister-in-law's birthday here last night.  None of us have tried this place.  We were really impressed with the food.  We loved the side dishes, especially the squid. Right behind our booth, someone else was celebrating their birthday and the staff sang a  birthday song and gave him/her a complimentary dessert.  So we had to tell them it was my sister-in-law's birthday also.  Our waiter assured us she would get a dessert too.  On the corner of our booth, I was excited to see that they give a free dessert if you rate them on Yelp  at the time of the visit.  It was a limited time offer so I wanted to take advantage of that. I showed the pictures to my 4 year old nephew and as soon as he saw the colorful macaron ice cream, which he called \"ice cream burger\", he asked for it right away.  I had to coax him to finish his food first  before we  get him the free ice cream.  He agreed and waited so patiently for it.  While everyone's eating, I downloaded the Yelp app so I could rate the restaurant and get the macaron ice cream for my nephew.  I followed the instructions and gave them a really good rating based on the food itself which was a 5 star for everyone.  I got up to use the restroom and asked my husband to show the review to them (as required). However, when I returned, my sister-in-law's complimentary dessert  was already there.   They didn't sing her a song either. It, unfortunately,  wasn't what my nephew had been waiting for. Our server told us that they would only honor one.  I'm not upset about not getting the free dessert cause we could have bought him one right there instead.  For one, it was already late. I just  didn't want to see my nephew disappointed.  We'll just buy him one in the morning from somewhere else.",

They only take reservations of eight people or more, but the two of us only had to wait about twenty minutes to be seated on a Tuesday night.  It is a long (but doable) walk from the strip. We d have given it 5 stars if they had one more server for slightly faster service and if the kimchi was on point. The other side dishes were very good though, especially the green onions. Yum!",

    "text": "Nice place for a first date as the seats are fairly far apart in the booths to allow room for the bbq pit in the middle of the table. A good way to keeps hands busy as well throughout the meal (not a chance of awkward hand holding) but dimly lit enough to make it feel intimate.   Being overly prepared we called in advance and made a reservation for two along with a toddler requiring a booster seat. Upon arrival right before the dinner rush around 2:45 pm Saturday we were promptly seated and greeted and drinks came out immediately afterwards. Seemed to be the best time to come because it was empty when we first got in and filled right up starting at 3:15. The ice tea was delicious, we had refills. I noticed that the booths basically were benches and were kind of uncomfortable, with a very utilitarian feel that assured me that men probably love flocking here for happy hour with their buddies. I was not wrong once I saw the happy hour menu as it was mostly geared towards beers. We dove right into the menu and ordered pork belly and marinated Kalbi strips to bbq with rice on the side ($1.95) and I ordered the Korean soft tofu soup with seafood.   Our server was attentive, not overtly friendly but helpful. Since it was just us two girls and we don't eat much we didn't get any appetizers or dessert. The first thing to come out first were the sides, which you get complimentary if you order at least two bbq dishes. There was a variety of them, what I noticed was the pickled vegetables were good, the kimchi was great and the bean sprouts were bland, but that was fine with me. Throwing them in the marinade they provide for dipping might help. Then our meats and my soup arrived. Oh my, delicious. We threw the meats on and I dug into my stew and it was instant love. Although the stone pot it comes in may seem small, the portion was perfect for me. The chef made it perfectly spicy, with a kick of kimchi taste and an egg cracked right in. There was a respectable amount of seafood in there which I appreciated, and the meats, once seared with a nice crust, were super yummy. I only needed half of the large helping of rice that came with my soup before I was full.   I then turned to the sangria which I order partway through my meal just to try. It was delicious, but made with a dry red wine I didn't love, with blueberries and raspberries floating within. Perfect sweetness though so no complaints, I'm just more of a non-dry white wine person. If you enjoy red, get the sangria. If not, the plum wine might be a better choice as I love Asian plum wines, plus it's cheaper. As a side note, the women's restrooms are well-kept and clean but no place to change your baby so not too friendly for families with babies.   Overall, thoroughly satisfied with the experience we had there is go back again. The only reason for the one star deduction was that it was a great experience but didn't knock my socks off with value for the price. I would go back though. A definite must for Asian cuisine foodies visiting Vegas!",

We had three meat plates (beef toro, pork belly, prime kalbi) and a few sides (oysters, dumplings, calamari, seaweed salad) , shared between three people. I was stuffed! We also ended up getting banana tempura for dessert. All in all, it was a good meal. My least favorite item probably wouldve been the calamari. But there are so many other items to order, it's not a big deal. It wasn't bad, I just have a high expectation for my calamari.   As far as service, they were on top of their stuff. Never had to ask for water. They checked on us just enough to not be annoying.   We went around 530, and we were the only people there, which worried me a bit. But by the time we left, about hour and a half later, the place was packed. So if you don't want to wait, be sure to go early.   All in all, I definitely will be back.",

    "text": "AMAZING RESTAURANT. I came here during my first night in Vegas based on Yelp reviews. This place got really good ratings, and apparently many other people realized this also. My family and I were starving, so it was a little disappointing when we found out there was a 40 minute wait. But it smelled so good, so we decided to sit it out and look at the menu (best decision ever). I enjoyed every part of my meal, especially the Original Bibimbap, the Spicy Seafood Noodle, and the Miso Beef. Plus, we checked in and got a free macaroon ice cream (which was also delicious)!!! We liked this place so much that before we went to the airport on our last day, we came back again for lunch! The waiters were really friendly and helpful and I would definitely recommend. I'm glad we got to start and end our Vegas trip with this place :)",

For our entree, we ordered beef tongue, beef toro, beef Kali, pork belly and mushroom medley. All the meats were really fresh and delicious. To add a little extra onto your meal, they offer 7 really good side dishes of the day as well.",

    "text": "When I go to a Korean barbecue place, I always go for all you can eat because I can get most of my money worth. Gangnam isn't all you can eat, but you are still getting your money worth.  Atmosphere is that of a high end restaurant. Dimly lit, fancy decorations, expensive looking grills, professional looking servers, & popularly hip music. What caught my attention the most was a projector showing music videos of not only well known recent English music, but they also have popular Korean groups also. I find myself dancing & singing along.  The servers are very helpful in recommending what to order. They're able to describe each dish or drink well enough to make a decision. They also give honest opinions on whether one thing is better than another thing.  The meats were served looking really fresh & presented really well on a plate. Of all the Korean barbecue places not one where I've seen the meat served already seasoned.  Not many Korean barbecue places I know have a Happy Hour or lunch special. This place has pretty good deals on their appetizers & meat. For the money you spend at all you can eat places, you'll have a better experience here compared to any other Korean barbecue place in Vegas. Drinks, meats, food, desserts - you can definitely taste the difference in quality & you can even make others jealous with a picture of a nice presentation too!",

    "text": "Great deal for Happy Hour ! Discounted prices for appetizers and meats. Its like $3 for an order of pork belly or beef toro (brisket).   Came here for \"dinner\" before an event i had to go to, with a friend. She had been here before and was on the way, so had me order (before it hit the end of Happy Hour time). She liked the Pork Belly and Pork Toro.   Service by this young korean waitress was superb. Very friendly and funny.   We had ordered 3 pork belly, 1 pork toro, 2 toro beef, and 1 prime kalbi.   The pork toro (pork cheek) isn't discounted. - $5.95 - As the \"toro\" name suggests, it is highly marbleized with some thick areas of fat on the edges. This isn't the first time i've had pork cheek (similar to pork neck meat as well). When cooked properly, and a good quality meat, it should have a super tender texture, and \"crispy\". Not like a hard crispy but like crisp to bite through. I cooked it in a way where it seared the fat giving it a nice crisp in the fat. The pork toro is NOT marinated or seasoned in any way. Quality, to me, seems not up to what i had imagined. Overall still not bad, but could be better. But pork cheek/neck meat is quite expensive. somewhere along $10-15/lb, wholesale. X_x   Prime kalbi - $8.45 - quality wise, wasnt that good either. For them to put the \"prime\" name, id expect a high quality cut of meat, flavorful and tender. Not to the point of aged meats, but you know what i mean. The prime kalbi is seasoned with some slight marinade topped with some finely minced garlic? Pieces are a fair thickness. Cooks nicely. Not as tender as i hoped, nor was it as marbleized as i have had this cut in other places.   Toro Beef - $3.45 - otherwise quoted as \"Beef Brisket\". By no means it is the Toro i was thinking of. It is straight up brisket, similar to that of what you get any where else. Misleading name, but i guess it was my fault for believing it may be more towards to the Toro name vs the quoted brisket name. Thin slices of meat. Cooks fast. Simple as that.   Pork belly - $2.95 - surprisingly, this was probably the best of the 4 items we had ordered. Even compared to the pork toro or prime kalbi. sad but surprising. Lol. Simple pork belly cuts.   Overall, not bad experience. Priced fair during happy hour. Pretty sure i wouldn't be ordering the meats not during happy hour though. Nice place to try if you are in the area.   They have a lot of appetizers discounted during Happy Hour as well. Didn't try any though.",

We ordered 6 different cuts of meat (spicy chicken, spicy pork, harami miso, kalbi, bulgogi, and regular pork). It was deliciously marinated and juicy and easy to cook yourself. I didn't even need the side sauces. The kimchi was perfectly spicy and the cucumber side dish was nicely sweet. The miso soup had the perfect temperature and flavor. Rice was perfectly cooked as well and service was extremely friendly and very attentive. Best part of it was all that came out to a price that was very affordable and reasonable for lunch (because you're off the strip). Highly highly recommend!!  Edit 3/1/17: came here again by myself and sat at the bar. I ordered several cuts of meat and the rock shrimp. When you sit at the bar you don't get to cook the meat yourself which I didn't realize. Honestly I was kind of happy about that because it takes so long to cook everything that sometimes it's just nice to sit back and relax and eat instead lol. They brought everything out quickly and it was just as tasty as before, as far as the flavors go. The cuts of meat were a little on the chewier side compared to last time (although ever so slightly it wasn't a big deal) but maybe also thicker and bigger from what I remember? ... maybe lunch vs dinner portion? Not sure. But still a great meal overall and this time I tried the side sauces which were really nice. Wait staff was on point again as well. Funny enough, they saw me on yelp adding this edit and my mochi ended up being on the house. Again, lots of great food for a great price with great service (why I always prefer to eat off the strip) Woo!",

Come during happy hour (1130am-5pm and then again after 10pm) and it'll be better bang for your buck.  We didn't eat much and was still really content and full (for me, at least). We only got short ribs, which they do remove the bones for you so it's just all meat. Then, we got beef brisket, which is pretty typical, as well as 2 orders of pork belly. I'm sad no tripe but I'll live. There are a lot of other things on the menu but I'm not a fan of marinated meat at KBBQs.  During my second visit, I got pork cheek, which was my first time eating it so I'm not sure how I feel about it yet... I wouldn't say everything is awesome-tasting but it's not too bad.  They've got a small selection of desserts but we only got ice cream ($1.95). Flavors: vanilla, green tea, and strawberry. It's a good portion size.  I doubt I'll come when it's not happy hour so there you go. But if you're in the area during happy hour, why not?",

Well, we then put our card out on the check and out of the 6 servers, 4 looked at it and walked right past us several times.   I work at a korean bbq place and was expecting a little more attention because that's just how korean bbq works, but nope. They had about 6 servers on an (extremely) slow weekday afternoon and it still seemed like they weren't tending tables well.    Definitely won't be recommending this place to my friends who are visiting anymore.   (There was ONE server who was so so kind and he def was hulling everyone else's asses. Wish I could've gave all the tip only to him..)",

We ordered the \"Gangnam\" dinner - at $65ish for 2 people it's not bad for Vegas prices, AND you get a ton of food that was way better than any buffet here. (My favorites were the fresh oysters and bulgolgi bibimbap). The main course is a medley of beef dishes that you cook yourself - we cooked them one at a time so we could enjoy them separately like a wine tasting. Fortunately all the beef cuts had a distinct flavor and texture so we didn't get burnt out on eating a ton of the same thing over and over. (To be honest, we probably could have saved $20 and got the \"Las Vegas\" dinner for 2, which also seems like a ton of food, but that has chicken and shrimp dishes instead of beef and I don't trust myself to cook those properly)  The service was friendly and attentive, the wait time was reasonable, the location was easy to get to and parking wasn't a hassle. Plus the ventilation was excellent because we didn't walk away smelling like food. Absolutely no complaints about this place and I would even go back next time we're in Vegas.",

Bulgogi has the perfect marinate of sweetness to it, spicy pork is deliciously spicy. Tongue is my favorite, super thinly sliced and the brisket is great too. Steamed egg is always cooked to perfection and my girlfriend is obsessed with the cheesy corn. They also bring out a few sides on the house (kimchi, mac salad, dipping sauces and other veggies).

Their happy hour is everyday from 4-6pm and the menu is solid; Three different types of meat- bulgogi, pork belly, and beef toro; a handful of veggies and handful of appetizers in addition to their free appetizers. You can also get pitchers of beer on happy hour. I've gone with a party of 6 people and spent around $100 with everyone getting well fed. Plus, if you check in, you get free ice cream. Who doesn't want free ice cream?!",

We went here after a week long hiking trip and ordered the Los Vegas dinner for two and it easily could have served four people. If you plan on going with two people order individually and if you go with four people order a meal for two- you won't be sorry.",

We made it just in time for Happy Hour and was surprised how good their HH menu was. 50% off appetizers/meat/beer/soju/sale! We ordered so much food for two and only spent about half of what we would've back home in San Jose!!   The food quality was really good and the service was even better. Everyone was super friendly and very attentive. Someone came around every few mins to see if we needed anything. They didn't try to rush us out even though there were people waiting to eat. This was probably the best experience/service/quality I had for Korean bbq in a long time.",

    "text": "After reading such amazing reviews about this place my husband and I decided to stop by for a late dinner. We arrived around midnight and the place was still packed with people. We had to wait about 15 minutes to get seated at a table. The place was clean, dimly lit and had the ambience of a club. There was music and music videos playing on the big screen. On to the food -- my husband really wanted to try the Kobe style beef since he's been craving it ever since he got back from his trip to Japan. We ordered a plate of the Kobe style beef, a plate of the flat iron garlic beef and a plate of the pork belly. The pork belly and garlic beef were good but nothing that we can't get back home. The Kobe style beef was a huge disappointment! They cut the slices extra thick which is not how Kobe should be served. The texture was really rough and hard to chew. Normally I would be craving more after only one plate of beef but their Kobe beef made me not want to eat meat ever again. Needless to say, we ended up only eating 2 pieces and leaving the rest to be thrown away... there goes $20 into the garbage. I ended up just eating the side dishes for the rest of my meal. Other than the food, the service was good. The guy who checked us out was friendly and accommodating. For dessert we tried the mango macron which ended up being the best part of the meal. The macron was super crunchy and soft and melted in your mouth and the ice cream was easy to bite into and didn't melt in your hands. I would only go back for the macron ice cream.",

    "text": "On a Saturday night, this back of the strip mall restaurant provided an enjoyable time and good food (that you cook at your own pace). The place was 50% full when we went there round 8pm. However, I think this place draws a late crowd as it is open until 2 am. Attractive staff and modern style furnished the space.   Be aware when sitting down. Check for water from the exhaust hood above. As Korean BBQ gets hot and the ac runs cold to keep it cool, condensation builds and can drip on to the table or seat. The underside of my shorts got wet when I slid into the bench style seat. (-1 star).  This place is good for 2-4, and larger tables of 8 are in the back. Super fast service! Don't be shy to flag the servers down. 3 people ran the front of the house. All 3 were at out table at some point.  We ordered a set combination of things and every bit was great. They prepared bibimbap table side and opened our mushroom foil pouch too. The grill didn't get too hot but would try this place in the winter time.  The good was of high quality and at some point, thought it may be too much. Food, 4 beers, house sake = $85 before tip. Not bad!",

This restaurant lags far behind other Korean BBQ joints in New York and Los Angeles particularly in terms of service, and while the food was solid it was by no means outstanding.  Food: We ordered the steamed egg which was way overcooked.  The BBQ dishes were decent however and the portions are all solid given the price.  The japchae was also on point.    Service: Nothing against the waiters as service was prompt, but the level of service was just not up to par for a Korean BBQ restaurant.  At the other restaurants I've been to servers cook the food for the customers, not to mention that beef and pork dishes are cooked on different specialized grill tops.  Once the meats are cooked the servers will slice them into bite-sized morsels.  Gangnam leaves the customers to do all of this on their own, and throughout dinner there was only one grill top which no one bothered to switch out even after the top was charred black.  The fan above the grill was also either off or not very strong so smoke was everywhere.",

This place is truly this great.   Go here, bring a group, and have a blast.  Make your meat to you're liking on your personal grill.",

Don't forget to try the sweet corn with cheese! That was tasty.   The wait time was not long at all, we got here at 3:30 on a Friday, Labor Day weekend. We were seated straight away.",

We were then persuaded by the waitstaff to order the 'Meat Lovers' combo for six which they informed us comes with three servings of each meat.  Two servings of meat later our grills were turned off and the dessert menu placed in our hand.  We informed the waitstaff that we were expecting another serving of meat but we were quickly shrugged off and informed that we received our three servings and that they were split among the trays on either side of our table.  Problem is they never brought the second tray with our third serving of meat.  Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere that does all you can eat with better pricing and doesn't try to swindle their customers.",

Instead, they offered me black or green tea ... which was brought out as a cup of hot water with a tea bag in it.  Very disappointing.  Should have left right then and there.  Asian place that serves tea like that can't be good.   We ordered three beef sides for our bbq.  Banchan included macaroni salad (?!?) and old, soft kimchi. The meats were tender and had good flavor, but the portion sizes were so small!  These were the smallest portion sizes I have ever had in a Korean bbq place. We also ordered lettuce and miso paste side ($2.50) to make bbq wraps, but what we got was celery sticks and romaine lettuce.  How do you wrap romaine lettuce?  In total, we spent ~$50 and left filled with mostly rice...   Service: although served relatively fast, the waiter never stopped by to ask if we need a refill (water, sides) on anything.  Considering what you get for the money spent, I do not recommend this place.  And all the people giving this place five stars ... do yourself a favor, look for a better place.  There are better places.",

    "text": "So Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining has been opened for awhile, but I only just noticed it very recently.  It is a Japanese and Korean DIY BBQ restaurant, where you can order items a la carte or from one of their many preset combinations.  It is a similar concept to Yagu (on the West side) and many other J or KBBQ restaurants in California.  Based on reading the past reviews (very helpful in convincing me to drive to this side of town for just a meal and go then back) and the photos posted for this business and comparing it to my first hand experience here, I can deduced that the restaurant has experimented with various promotions before settling on their current all day Happy Hour promotion.  Gone are their lunch special menu or previous versions of their HH menu.  Now you get 1/2 off selected beverage items and discounted menu items.  The food I was served was good and tasted even better when cooked properly and to the exact doneness that I want.  And since it was not AYCE, I did not felt subconsciously compelled to overindulge during the meal with the final destination dangerously close to meat coma station.  Price was reasonable, not cheap when you add everything up, but you get good quality for the price.  The server was very friendly and helpful, as was the owner or the restaurant manager/model (yeah, she definitely exudes the essence of Gangnam style). The restaurant itself looks very nice (posh with well executed design and decoration).  Suggested party size for dining here is up to 4 per table, as you have to share the grill built into the table.  Don't wear anything that you don't want smelling like it was generously sprayed with the delicious smell of sweet BBQ smoke after you leave or have a change of cloth for going back to work. Best time to come is after work so you can take advantage of their HH drink specials without having to feel like an alcoholic for the 2nd part of your work day.  Bulgogi, Korean Prime Short Rib and the Kurobuta (Japanese Pork) Sausage was what I ordered to be grilled and is what I would recommend to others trying out this restaurant.  No free banchan here, but you can order their Kimchee and Pickles (both are $0.00) to compliment your meal.  Solid 4 stars experience based on the service, food, atmosphere and price to value.",

My fave was the beef toro and those pieces are pretty big so I had to cut them up! Only downside was that it was sometimes hard to get a waiter/waitress' attention and some of the things we ordered took a while to come out of the kitchen. Besides that I enjoyed my experience here. Would definitely recommend coming here, especially during happy hour!",

    "text": "My wife and I went to Gangnam at a time that I thought was way too early for lunch. We arrived just before 4:30pm and casually walked into the restaurant only to find that every table was occupied. We were put on the waiting list (we were the only name, but look at the time) and had to wait about 10 minutes for our table. By 5:00pm, the waiting area was completely packed! What had we stumbled upon?   For $59, we ordered the Meat Lover Combo for 2. It included complimentary banchan (sides), 2 bowls of rice, 2 miso soup, a salad, seaweed salad, 4 steamed dumplings, and six meats including pork belly, spicy pork, bulgogi, kalbi, brisket, and filet mignon. We could have splurged a little and gone for some higher quality cuts, but my wife and I are pretty simple people. The setup is very thoughtful and patrons are encouraged to cook their own meat (at some Korean BBQ's, the servers get annoyed if you grill yourself). On the table includes a pair of scissors, two tongs, and just about everything you'd need to grill on your own. Even still, the servers were very active and ready to take care of your needs. The whole combo is well thought out except the dumplings. Since the theme of the dishes is Korean with Japanese influences, the dumplings (very Chinese style) are very misplaced. I would have preferred an order of romaine lettuce ($2) in place of the dumplings.    One side note about the side dishes-the kimchi was so good! It was perfectly ripe, which can be tricky at restaurants that do such a high volume of business.  My wife and I definitely enjoyed our dining experience and would love to order using the a la carte menu in the future.",

We called ahead and the person on the phone said there is lunch special available. When we came our waiter said no there isn't and said that person probably didn't know cause he was knew. I was a little annoyed but whatever. I ordered the tofu soup for 10 bucks which is a pretty reasonable deal. However when they brought it out... It was the smallest bowl of soup I've ever seen. I would call this a mug of tofu soup.. It's like the size of a side tofu soup they give you during korean bbq. So disappointed. Flavor wish it's fine.",

Food: Salty! Everything is made with extra sodium... the meat, soondubu, jap chae etc. the pork belly is full of fat. I get it's pork belly, but the cut was really cheap. We got the toro, marinated kalbi, and bulgogi and none were impressive. In fact, my party was going to ask if we can sell some meat back! The \"compliment\" dishes were all salty and doesn't seem fresh. It was kimchi, kimchi cucumber, mac, fish cake.  Disappointed and will not recommend.",

The sides we chose were: seafood pancake, tempura, spicy tuna Kim bap, edamame & chap-chae - all wonderful except the tempura was average. They have macaroon ice cream sandwich which were fresh & yummy  They also had other desserts that most Korean restaurants typically don't have.  We will definitely be coming back here.",

The servers here seem to be pretty nice and the customer service is pretty good. I didn't have any issues with ordering food or having things come out too late.   The meat quality is alright. I ordered the Korean Prime Kalbi, Prime Kalbi, and Harami Miso which looked amazing, but it was the ultimate blue ball. They were well marbled which I loved, but it was surprisingly tough... what a disappointment. The beef looked to be on par with that of Magal Korean BBQ, but when you bite into it, you can tell that there is a huge difference in quality. The banchan here was surprisingly good, but the bibim nangmyun was not quite where I wanted it to be. They need to put less chilled broth in it because it was almost indistinguishable from mul nangmyun.   The only redeeming quality of this place is the price. I ordered 3 plates of beef and an order of Bibim Nangmyun and it came out to roughly $50 with tax and tip. If I were to order the same stuff at Magal, it would be roughly $80 to $90.  All in all, this is a so-so korean bbq spot that made me reminiscent of home, but it was nothing spectacular. The service is good, but the beef quality is forgettable. After my experience here, I was wondering how so many people could think this place is so damn amazing, but then I saw a little sign on our table. They offer free macaron ice cream for every review that is written. They pretty much bribe people into writing good reviews for a free dessert.   If you come here looking for Korean BBQ nirvana, keep on looking. If you want a moderately priced and decent quality BBQ joint, this may be for you. Just don't expect amazing things from here.",

It was perfectly spiced. The other meats, chicken, pork, beef and shrimp were also very good. They also generous on all the traditional Korean sides, such as salads, Kimchi, dried scuttle fish, tofu, etc. Overall, it's a great little place away from the strip. The servers are very friendly. Tip:  Come very hungry and grill your own food.  I will always come back to this place anytime we're in Las Vegas.",

Food has great flavor with perfect marinating time on the beef. Side dishes are one of the things that I am always critical on in any review, these sides are amazing Jim her has great flavor as well as all the others, I think i found my new favorite in town!!!",

At first I thought I was kinda sucky that this was a Korean BBQ place that wasn't AYCE and I thought our bill was gonna end up being really pricey for all the things we ordered (spicy seafood soup w/ tofu, cream cheese wontons, salmon carpaccio, toro beef, and pork belly), and I also thought that I wouldn't leave feeling full.   But I was SO wrong. The quality of the meat blows Tofu Hut, Sura, and all those other KBBQ joints out of the water. Yeah, it's a bit pricier, but the quality definitely makes it worth it.   The soup was delicious. It came with rice on the side, which I used to eat my meat with. THAT SALMON CARPACCIO THOUGH!! That was probably my favorite thing we ordered that night. I highly recommend giving it a try. Even the cream cheese wontons were really good!  The layout and decor of the restaurant has a modern feel to it. They have big booths along the side walls and tables in the middle. They also play American and Korean music videos on the wall.   Not to mention the service/servers are beyond excellent. My waitress was attentive, informative, and very friendly.",

    "text": "I've found my new favorite place. Basically, if you ever thought, \"I could cook this myself!\" well then, you are in heaven. Tons of options and only yourself to blame if it's not cooked right.   Great appetizers, tons of meats to try, REVERSE HAPPY HOUR 10pm to close. Even if you got something you didn't like (or just messed up cooking it), the prices are great.  Spicy Tuna Kimbap:  awesome as an appetizer to start. The serving is HUGE. You won't feel shorted when you order. You may get scalp sweats, but that's a good thing.   Chili Garlic Wings: These were fine, not the best wings you've ever had but pack plenty of meat and flavor.  Bulgogi: People seem to love this. It's not great. It's the meat I liked the least. Consistency is gummy. It's a sticky meat. Has a bit of a jerky taste to it. Impossible to really cook on the grill. It's a pass for me.   Pork Belly: It was good. It wasn't as flavorful as I thought but it melts in your mouth. They do give you plenty of strips so it works out that way. Plenty of trays to dunk it in too.  Filet Mignon: How could you say no to this? Of course, the cuts are tender and succulent. Probably the thing that works against it is that they are THICK cuts. Eating it usually involves putting the WHOLE chunk in your mouth. But it's filet mignon, it is delicious.  Flat Iron Garlic: Great garlic flavor, thinner cuts make cooking and eating this a tad bit easier that the Filet. Plenty of meat to dip too.  But really everything we had was good. Even the Bulgogi wasn't that bad. Seems like you can't go wrong here. That's a sign of a great place to eat.",

Quality meat and great service, but we ordered too much though so just forewarning we had a table of 7 and we got the dinner for six plus ramen, japchae, and soft tofu soup and it was way too much food for us. The meat they give are really reasonable portion so I would say order the meat combo that they put together since it's a really great deal for what you get. You get soup, appetizer, and the meat along with rice. What some other reviews were saying about how this place is a less expensive version of Gyu-Kaku, I would agree. You'll be super satisfied so it's a must-try if you're ever in Vegas!",

The spicy tofu soup (with seafood) is good too, just enough spice to make you sweat. I'm docking off a star because sometimes it seems like the wait staff are annoyed of you when you need something.  Check in on Yelp and get free macaron ice cream (total of bill must be over $15 to qualify).",

When we walked in, there were so many people waiting inside. So I thought this is a great sign. This place must be good. We waited over an hour and finally got seated. We ordered some short ribs and balgogi, soft tofu soup, and a clear noodle dish.   All the meat just taste like balgogi, pure sweet, has no kick at all. Soup was too salty. Calamari was blend, I don't understand why they mark it as \"must try\".  I have korean friends, and I visited bounch korean restaurants. Nothing were like this sweet.   I am very disappointed, since I saw this place on yelp when I was at salt lake a week ago.   The only thing that's okay was their kimchi.",

The deokbokki was perfectly al dente though, and the kalbi was also super tender. The food comes out fairly quickly and the staff was very pleasant. The bill came out to be about $35 a person.

It was a graceless, ill-seasoned, flavorless mess. It was as if someone had decided to prepare a \"Korean meal\" at home, threw  \"Asian sauces\" on a few vegetables, made a salad, put chunks of cheap raw meat on a board, and served it up with a big hopeful smile.    I was able to eat the oysters, and there was some tofu thing that wasn't awful, but the rest of it was either offensively nondescript or downright repulsive. Has this place never heard of doenjang?  The surprise hard boiled egg hidden in the salad gave me sufficient energy to get back to my hotel. Otherwise, that was a rather expensive non-meal.  To be clear: this isn't Korean food. This is crudites and cheap raw meat. You could do it at home for $5.",

Would have given this place 5 stars because the food was great but the service wasn't as helpful as I would have liked. But I would have ordered the Tuna Poki and Cream Cheese Rangoon even knowing that we had too much food. They were both amazing!!!  It was out first time there and with Korean BBQ and we didn't really know what we were doing. The waitress we had disappeared for a while and didn't explain very well what was going on. If you are familiar with self-grilled Korean BBQ I'm sure you'd love it. A heads up if you've never had Soju, it tasted like vodka to me, not Sake. Sake is much easy to sip, I had to drink the Soju like a shot.",

The atmosphere reminded me of an upscale clean Korean BBQ restaurant that I had visited in California and you can't find that in most Las Vegas locations. It is well-ventilated, dimly-lit and the dark and red tones are romantic.  FOOD: my boyfriend and I ordered the Original Bibimbap $10 and the Korean Pancake with Thrifty's Vanilla Ice Cream $5-6. The Bibimbap was delicious and the stone pot was so hot it made the some of the rice crispy, cooked the vegetables and marinated beef well but kept the juices flowing and our stomachs satisfied! The Korean pancake was kind of small  but the ice cream was Thrifty's and that alone was a point.  SERVICE: accommodating and quick! Served us quickly and efficiently. The servers took time to talk to us and find how we were doing.   Definitely a must try and the people working there are very nice. I say give it a try =)",

    "text": "We went off the strip for our final meal before leaving Las Vegas on Thanksgiving weekend.  This Korean BBQ restaurant is on Paradise Road just behind the northern strip hotels.    Although the strip mall it is located in seemed busy, the restaurant itself was pretty vacant for a Sunday night at 6:30PM.    They gave us a menu with \"happy hour\" pricing on most of the food packages, which I'm not sure if that is given at all times or not.  Anyway, 4 stars.  The decor is really nice, the service is very attentive, the food was great.  They bring all the food to you. The Miso Soup was delicious. The meats were brought to our table, and they ask if you want assistance in cooking them at your table; however, we declined and cooked them ourselves.  Everything was fresh and delicious.    Minus one star for one reason only.  I thought the prices were a bit high with the \"happy hour\" pricing.  If the prices are truly higher during peak hours, I would definitely not come back.  At the \"happy hour\" prices, I would consider a return, although it is still a bit expensive for what it is.",

I wasnt expecting much since yelp stars cant be trusted sometimes. But OMG just as we walked in..Cute Korean Dudes.. lol. No but seriously, the staff were very accommodating and friendly. The place looked very clean, modern and spacious. We got there around 6pm and the place was packed. We got seated shortly after and Calvin, our waiter was very helpful in deciding what to get. We then ordered their Best Seller: Gangnam for 2, $65.95. We felt that the portions were perfect, mann we were stuffed. Then we had Honey Toast and Lava Cake for dessert..yummy! Apparently if you make a yelp review you get either a Lava Cake or Banana Tempura Ice Cream for free.  Our first time experience at this place was awesome. It just might be our new go-to place. The food, and the staff was great. I definitely would recommend this place. It is on the pricey side, but definitely worth it.",

    "text": "As a local half Korean, my Korean mother and I  frequently go to Korean restaurants while we are out shopping. We were in the area and decided to give this spot with over 4,000 reviews a try. We had big expectations! Perhaps this spot is a hit with tourists but we weren't impressed. First of all,  it irritates me as a culinary professional when restaurants use culinary terminology so loosely. I ordered Sukiyaki Noodle with Beef. If you know Japanese cuisine you know Sukiyaki. I was expecting noodles along with something that resembles Sukiyaki. After all that's what it's called, right? What I got was stir fried noodles with chunks of beef and sliced red peppers served in a stone pot. What is so Sukiyaki about this? Nothing in this dish is anything you would find in Sukiyaki. In Sukiyaki, the beef is thinly sliced rib eye and there is no red bell peppers in it but rather, spinach, shiitake mushrooms, onions, green onions, tofu, bamboo and yam noodles. More appropriately this should be called Yaki Noodle with Beef which simply is stir fried noodles. It looked nothing like the photo on the menu and the portion was very small. My mom had the bean paste soup and it was nothing special. The pickles were bland and lacking any flavor. We ate our lunch but knew we would not come back again. The service? My tea cup sat empty without any question if we would like more hot water.  I finally asked for more hot water since I was never offered it. For $2.50 for each hot tea? At other Korean restaurants in town, hot tea is complimentary.",

I'm spoiled by the generous portions from the other KBBQ places I've been to. The vegetables included in the combo were random and awkward too. The combo does not come with your traditional banchan (Korean side dishes). No kimchi, no lettuce, none of the usual Korean sauces for your meat. We did get three sauces-ponzu, glazed sauce, and a somewhat spicy sauce. It wasn't terrible but without my banchan, there was something lacking for sure. Yes, I realize it's not a traditional KBBQ restaurant-some Korean/Japanese BBQ fusion. The service was good though. The restaurant is modern, clean, and trendy but that's not enough for me to come back.",

We had the \"Gangnam Special\" for two that could have easily fed four. Too long of a wait for an average restaurant. If you're willing to travel away from the strip a little further you will find more authentic, nicer Korean BBQ restaurants. The service was nice and very quick. I would have given it a 2.5 if they had half stars because it's friendly and clean.",

There is a 2 order BBQ meat minimum for the sides, which isn't hard to do because we wanted everything!! We ordered bulgogi, spicy pork, spicy chicken, Kalbi, and pork belly. All the meat came out perfectly marinaded and so tender! The only thing was the pork belly, it came plain with no marinade. I would definitely order round 2 if I had the stomach to.  We also ordered the spicy tofu soup, which was also equally delicious. The tofu is very soft, which is the way I like mine.   The pricing here is definitely affordable as well. They have a happy hour menu from 10pm-1am. Appetizers and BBQ will be either $3 or $4. And they have half off drinks!   I definitely left here feeling full and satisfied. If I lived in Vegas, I would definitely come here for Korean BBQ.",

The calamari was so soft too although there ended up being too much calamari to soup ratio. x STEAMED EGG ($4.95) this was not very good as it was over-steamed and not silky as it usually is at other restaurants.  x HARAMI MISO ($8.95) This was really succulent and tasty. Must order! x KOREAN PRIME KALBI ($8.95) This was tasty although a bit too fatty for my liking.   The lettuce is $2 but it is so fresh and crispy, it is a must for complimenting the bbq meat.  Rate them on Yelp and you get a free dessert. We got the Mocchi which was OMG.  We were so full at the end but the prices were so reasonable.

But when you order the combos for 2 people, you're actually getting enough for 3 or 4. Get one of those and a la carte the few selections you really enjoyed and you're bill will be about 100$ total for 6 people! Not bad, right?  When they ask what kind of rice you want - normal or bulgogi mixed - definitely get the bulgogi. That stuff was the bombbbbbbbbbbbbb. Perfectly sweet to go along with the savory meat!",

I like to come here with my girlfriend because the booths make me feel like I'm in a private place. The restaurant looks like it is brand new and I enjoy the music videos that they play on their projection which is a mix of Korean, American Pop, and some funny ones like Boy Dance Party from SNL. If you get Kristin as a server, you're in great hands! She is very helpful at suggesting food items and checks on our table at a consistent rate. She actually looks like she enjoys her job and enjoys serving you . The staff has always been attentive with my water also as I am a fast drinker. Their servers speak fluent English too   My usual order consists of brown rice, kimchi (free), salmon jalapeno poppers (sooo good), 2 orders of toro beef and 2 orders of pork belly. The owner is friendly, and willing to help out with anything .   This is my favorite Korean BBQ spot in Vegas , check it out!",

The ambiance is nice and clean with a modern edge, well ventilated tables meant my hair didn't smell like smoke after, and servers are pleasant and eager to please.  We did NOT get a combo, but instead ordered a-la-carte, mostly premium meats with a simple bowl of rice, kimchi and pickles. We satisfied our hunger, enjoyed almost every meat dish, and cleansed our pallets with a dessert all for less than the combo price...the difference? We didn't fill-up or waist money on the appetizers (that come with the combos).",

We might have been better off choosing individual items but we wouldn't have gotten to try everything we did!  The miso soup was one of the best I've had, very flavorful.  The cream cheese wontons and edamame were good, as expected.  The 8 side dishes were a nice touch.  The shrimp were excellent, as was the korean chicken; the spicy chicken was too spicy for me so husband had that to himself.  Alternatively, I had the beef toro to myself; it was very fatty, in fact tasted like the fat on a grilled steak which I love but husband doesn't eat fat on purpose...(!) Get the bulgogi bibimbap instead of white rice; it's a more interesting rice dish with beef in it. Only had 1 piece of the broccoli cheese fondue, was just so much food something had to give!  The salad we didn't even touch until the end of the meal; we were pretty full but it had a nice light dressing that was a good ending.",

Pork overdone in kitchen tried to spare the servers of cleanup for one person. Beef also cool ok marinade. Kimchi excellent as were the other Namul. Cukes, chili and radish,shredded dried fish, bean sprout, fish cake. Chap chae was quite good. Paid bill. Came back in one hour because my cousin was hungry so I brought him here. Happy hour continues. Noticed a note the new table offering dessert for a Yelp review. I had already done one. Waiter kindly offered dessert of fried banana and ice cream. Cousin enjoyed sukiyaki. It smelled good. He also ordered chicken salad. He was too full to try it. Overall good experience but just not the \"best\" in the Korean experience. I would still recommend for price point, happy hour, and location and parking. Not a bad thing.",

I appreciate the small order \"Korean tapas\" style menu.  This way you get to try a little of everything.  Three dipping sauces are on the table, which is really nice.  The free ice cream sandwich was the perfect dessert.  I'm only knocking off a star due to the slow service.  It wasn't very busy and yet our waiter would vanish, and his replacement would also vanish.",

Once seated food and drinks started flowing quickly and the banchan was very good with the fish cake and dried squid the standouts.  The bulgogi and spicy lemon chicken were both very good with the bulgogi coming out on top.  The bulgogi had great marination while the chicken seemed a bit dry and tasteless, though the lemon dipping sauce was refreshing.  The corn is great once grilled as well and a perfect addition to the meal.  Add in the fact that flavored soju is half off, at only $6 per bottle that's almost market price in this city.  Ridiculous deal on drinks and fantastic options for food on the Happy Hour menu.  If you pay over $20 per person after getting full and drunk I'd be surprised.  One of the best deals in town and with great food to match.",

Pork belly was the least favorite. In order of preference filet mignon, pork, brisket, skirt and toro. Miso soup was great and the appetizers gave you the chance to try lots of different things.

    "text": "Got a call from a friend whose birthday venue turned out to be overbooked. She was frantic to find a place that served Asian food, was affordable, but great enough for the dozen of us to enjoy--in  a couple of short hours from her call!  Of course, I turned to Yelpers and the fact that Gangnam had over 2,500 reviews with an average rating of 4.5 stars convinced me this was a safe place to recommend. My friend immediately booked their private room for 7pm.  While the restaurant appeared small from the storefront, it was surprisingly well laid out for groups, couples, and we saw singles dining, too. So don't hesitate to stop in if you're dining solo.  We were seated in a private room toward the back, large enough, yet cozy for 12.  As soon as most of the group were seated, the ban chan was brought in. Large variety of appetizer were laid out, including the requisite kimchi mixes, sprouts, taegu, and more. Our friendly server guided us to the combination selections.  It was unanimous that the Gangnam combo would be the way to go as the more people you have, the better the price per person. The ban chan had the requisite various kimchi, sprouts, and much more.  Onion miso soup, large salad to share, fresh oysters on the  half shell, grilled shishito peppers, mushroom medley, choice of steamed rice or bulgogi bibimbap rice, and beef ... lots and lots of beef ... kalbi, bulgogi,  etc. Food seemed to just keep coming until we were overwhelmed and finally tapped out!  We enjoyed the experience and the food so much, we're planning on heading back with another group of family coming to town in a few weeks.",

The jalapeno poppers really \"popped\" out for me.  For the main course, we got the kalbi bbq (marinated) and prime rib. The marinated meat was superb. We also got the glass noodle and the tofu soup, also memorable. Prices were much more reasonable than prices in Silicon Valley but on the more expensive side when compared to downtown LA prices.

The menu covers appetizers, some fusion (Korean-Japanese) dishes as well as traditional Korean BBQ meats.  The restaurant is nice and clean and there is a grill in the center of each table to cook the meat.  We had a party of six and two of our guests had no previous Korean dining experience. They liked the fact that we prepared our own food. They even had forks for these poor souls.  The outcome was that everyone had a great time and wanted to come back again when we return to Las Vegas for next year's convention.  All the items are per portion so I imagine it might take a visit or two to get the quantities right.  The server was very friendly and hip and ready to assist all the various levels of guests entering Gangnam.",

For instance, the extractor fan was not on (or was not working) all time it was hot by then and our clothes were left super delicious; they never bothered to change the burnt charred black grill, and  unlike many other Korean BBQ when meats arrived they never cut it into smaller size for you to grill.",

    "text": "I came to this restaurant for the simple reason that I had to get out of the hard rock hotel. This was right across the street and I figured anything was better than spending more time at the smoky trashy hotel that was trying too hard.  My first reaction upon seeing the menu was to be a bit taken aback by the printed discount signs on the menu. Made me think of \"regular price 9.95 but just for you it's 7,50--- maybe because the food is old or no one wants to go there.\"  I worried too much. The food was reasonably good. Tasty Korean BBQ at an affordable price. Service was pretty indifferent. \"Yes we have a smaller table but it isn't set up: why don't you sit at the bar.\"  And I had to wait for a fair amount of time before getting any attention to place my order. The indifferent service might account for my bulgogi being a bit on the cold side. But the food did taste good and was a good value for the money.  I",

Now it's not cheap by any measurement at $90 for 2 people so keep your AYCE mentality out of this establishment.  This is not what you are coming here for.  You are coming to enjoy the quality over quantity!!  So be ready to just have melt in your mouth fun with this place...",

We went with meat lovers the first day. even though it was for two people, it was just the right amount for the three of us girls. We switch to uni rice and added more money. It was on Stone pot and we left it longer so the rice was charred and crunchy. We each checked in to get free macaroon and we liked the strawberry and coffee flavor. The second time we got the premium beef. The meat was more melt-in-your-mouth and unfortunately the uni rice was not available that day, bummer. It was good quality and great first stop from the airport before going to our hotel or vice versa.",

I was SO looking forward to this meal and it was the first stop after leaving the airport to kick off the weekend in Vegas. We arrived at 3pm, so the restaurant was really empty (it can get packed!). The service and the timing for the food was perfect due to the slower time of day we dined. I believe that dining at 3pm def allowed us to have a better experience.   Each table is set up with it's own grill and has a hood vent. Although the hood helps, be prepared to still smell like grill when you leave the establishment. We settled on one of the pre-selected bundles 'meat lover'   at $56 for 2 people-which had 6 proteins and an array of salad, soup, and apps. Of course the bonchon side dishes were complimentary and delicious. The best meats in the meat lover set were the beef toro and the flat iron garlic. Both were melt in your mouth delicious.   I think the sets are a good way to try more of the menu if you're new to the establishment but when I go back I'll be likely to just order cuts that I love.",

The staff was super helpful at teaching us and making suggestions, even giving me a couple of recipes!! We chose the the Gangnam Combo per the servers suggestion and he (David) even let us switch out a couple of things that we liked better. I got to try a few things that I'd never had before including what I'd call spicy pickles. They were awesome along with the jalapeno & radishes. I also got to try the squid which was chewy and not something I prefer, but I always love trying new things! We switched out our soup and salad for the ramen soup and it was not good, just tasted like they opened a packet of ramen from the store. My son would have loved it, but we passed. We had tons of food besides the ramen and walked away way too full! Oh and one of the best parts is you receive a free ice cream macaroon cookie sandwich for a Yelp check-in and it was very good (I had mango)! We will totally go back when in Vegas and we will be taking our kids to Korean BBQ over Spring Break in our hometown now! Fun, fun, fun & filing!",

Or do they need the $6 for a bottle of water that badly?? It is scummy either way to serve something questionably safe to save money or make more.   That being said we already ordered by the time our inital tap water came and the food was okay. We had to spend extra money on bottled water. Honestly I will go to Hobak or anywhere else. I kinda can't get past the nasty water thing. They present like a nicer restaurant but can't afford a filter for their water. I'm sure they are cheating customers out of good quality food.",

The food itself is more Korean style - not the most authentic Korean BBQ you're ever going to get, but it's not bad at all. The prices aren't terrible (could be cheaper like in other cities sometimes, but still not bad). Nothing stood out at me, but it was all decently solid food. Our main waitress kind of seemed like she didn't want to be bothered though. It wasn't bad service, but she still kind of gave off that vibe for some reason.

Curious for having 4 1/2 star, I thought this might worth a try. And I'm so glad that we did. The set menu ( called Vegas) for 2 people is just perfect servings for the three of us. It starts with soup, appetizers and salad. And then comes the shrimps and 3 more kind of meat. Plus the yummy bibimbap!! Fast service, clean and welcoming ambiance. And of course awesome korean food. We will definitely do this korean food tripping again",

This was first time at a Korean Japanese bbq. The idea of cooking my own food at a restaurant may not appeal to everyone but i loved it. The prices at happy hour was low enough to be able to try a little bit of everything.  After they tske your order. They turn on the grills amd bring out an assortment of sauces and sides....most of which i had no idea what they were but they were good.  We ordered broccoli , chicken cheese fondue, bulgogi, pork belly, spicy chicken, shrimp. Everything was delicious and fun. I can't wait until a place like this comes to my town.  Great food, great time.",

Granted, both times have been during a week day and lunchtime, but, the service was prompt and friendly. The food is amazing! The decor is lovely. I like the low key music video playing on the large screen you can choose to ignore or enjoy.   As for the food, the Tuna Poki was fantastic - not fishy at all and the combo of tuna, seaweed and radish was fab. The spicy edamame - awesome. Lastly, the Fire Cracker Shrimp was no joke. It is not for the faint of heart, but if you love spicy food like I do, you will love the combination of crunch, spice and a bit of sweet. It was really tasty.  Would definitely come back again,",

The chicken was SOOO tender ... I even asked how they got their chicken to be so tender, our server said it was because their chicken is free-range chicken.   Speaking of our server, Mam, she is as super attentive and overall amazing.  The rest of the servers were also great, they all seem to help out unlike other places were other servers won't help out other tables. Will definitely come back.",

All I have to say is the next time I'm craving kbbq when I'm in Vegas I know where to go! No wait to get seated. The food is quality and the service is great.   Another dope thing about this restaurant is that they have happy hour everyday from 3-6 and 10-close. Their happy hour is a great deal and for sure get you full for a cheaper price.

Right before we left the hotel to go to the restaurant I read Yelper Betty N's review and was hoping her review was off a lil in relation to the majority of Yelp reviews. As the evening wore on I quickly realized Betty N was on point with her review and the rest were skewed and off kilter. We ordered the Las Vegas which is a meal for two, and added the ribs. The ribs were ok but for me this was the most flavorless meal the whole trip. I was sorely disappointed. I have nothing more to say about this.  Oh wait...the drinks were ok.",

We ordered the Gangnam special for 2 people, and a side dish of corn cheese. I have had different type of corn cheese in la, so this one was just ok to me.. maybe a little too creamy? and it didn't get really burned on the bottom of the cast iron dish it was, (neither did the bulgogi bibimbap, but it was still tasty).  Ended up paying around $90 including tip for 2 people, and we did not have any drinks, just water.  Overall I would say that the quality and taste of this place is pretty good, however it is a little pricy if you are expecting typical korean bbq stuff. For example, the Gangnam didn't include Brisket, or Pork belly, which is usually one of our staples for korean bbq. It did however include some oysters, which was nice (although I don't like oysters too much myself).  We are used to korean bbq in california, where you can get AYCE ranging as low as $9.99-$30 per person, and I'm also used to wrapping my korean bbq in radish and rice paper and a plethora of sesame oil plus salt and pepper sauce, and lots of sliced green onion.  You can order meat ala carte, so they do have a customizable menu based on how much you want to try/order....  The side dishes were pretty good, I liked the fish cake, etc.",

He basically cooked the meat for us, which was amazing. Now I'll know how to cook it myself next time.   I wanted to ask him if he was the chef because he seemed to know so much about cooking. We later found out that he was the owner. He was so humble and just helped us out no questions asked.   His customer service was so beyond amazing!!!  Everything that we are was really good as well.

The place looked clean but I was a bit EH because I looked up & the filtration grills looked absolutely DISGUSTINGLY dusty & oily.  To the point I was scared that the dust might fall into my food....  I used to work at a  ASIAN BBQ joint so it literally looked like they haven't cleaned it for a month.  =[   The service was quick & fast but definitely would say they could work on smiling a bit?  Ahahahah our server was AWSOME though cuz we also knew her from the sushi resteraunt that we love so much in north Vegas!  (The second time we went the service was definitely slower even though there was no one in the place...  Like asking for water and side dishes multiple time from different people before receiving.  So maybe need a little work on the employees).   The quality of the meat was SURPRISINGLY good! They are a Korean joint but they have the concept kind of like Japanese BBQ in style of serving.  You get a whole bunch of side dishes like any Korean resteraunt & the side dishes aren't bad at all.  They were a good amount & good quality for the amount of money you pay I would say.  I can't really say the other dishes were that great as for the NORMAL palate....  I would have to say it is a bit on the SALTIER side...  But I LOVED IT.  PRIME GALBI $8.95 - just straight up melts in your damn mouth!   HARAMI MISO $8.95 - this is out skirt steak & loved the extra miso flavor.   GARLIC SHRIMP W/ HEAD $5.95 - what a steal. On the price I personally think for jumbo shrimp at only $6 bux & it is lightly seasoned w/ garlic.   ENOKI W/BACON $4.95 - no difference but you do get a lot of enoki mushrooms which is great & you get 4 pieces.   ASPARAGUS W/ BACON $4.95 KABOCHA SQUASH $2.95   BROCCOLI $3.95 - this comes inside a foil already steamed for you to finish off on the grill to give a little char.   PORK TORO $5.95 - ummmmm my FAVORITE part of the pork & you get it at pretty much a $1 a slice!  Where as most places I have been to it is $2 a slice   SPICY TUNA KIMBAP $6.95 - this is literally see weed wrapped rice & then tempura battered.  It has the PERFECT chewy texture like mochi & then stopped off w/ spicy Mayo tuna!   CHILI SPICY WINGS $6.95 - this is what typical Korean wings taste like & I love it.   SPICY SOFT TOFU SOUP $9.95 - I absolutely CRAVE this damn soup....  I'm sure there is some crack in it...  & doesn't really taste like your typical Korean spicy soft tofu soup but I loved it!",

There are korean music videos playing inside, keeping patrons entertained and in the korean mood. The spicy tuna kim bap was the surprise of the meal - very tasty. The Kimbap  was fried with marinated spicy tuna in a bowl. Korean prime kalbi was excellent as well!  The only caution would be the meat portions are VERY small. For example, the prime galbi only comes out to be like 4 or 5 tiny pieces....bulgogi portion was also very small...I killed it in literally two bites.....if you want to get more meat, stick with samgyupsal because it looked like they give you more portion for pork meats.  Also, for limited time only, if you write a yelp review and show it to them, they will give you a free dessert! We got the fried banana tampura with green tea ice cream..it was really good!!",

    "text": "Went here for dinner tonight. Since I was alone, they asked me if I would like to sit at the bar and like a fool I said Yes, not realizing that it meant not getting to grill my own meat. Oh Well... You live, you learn.(I wish they had told me that though).  They started me off with a plethora of side dishes and accompaniments which all eventually went really well with the meats and a bowl of white rice; everything except a random macaroni salad that is which I didn't quite understand being there.  I ordered the Kobe Beef which was the main reason I went here and the Garlic Calamari which they recommended. They serve 6 pieces of beef and some sea salt which you absolutely must sprinkle on. It enhances the flavor exponentially. This was my first time eating Kobe Beef and I now understand what all the hype is about. It was just juicy, so flavorful, so amazingly tender. Without a shadow of a  doubt the best quality beef I've ever had.  They did overcook it a tad and it was medium-well which is maybe how they do it, but for such a cut I would most certainly have preferred a mid-rare. Very highly recommended, even though it's ridiculously pricey. The Garlic Calamari was a huge fail. They were cooked well and tender but had no flavor at all and I had to douse them in hot sauce and soy to finish them.  Overall this was an awesome meal. I would definitely love to go back here and try some more cuts and also grill them myself this time by getting a table instead of sitting at the bar. It's actually pretty reasonable(except the Kobe obviously) considering how much meat they serve. Definitely recommended.",

    "text": "I come from Boston, where there are only a handful of Korean restaurants. Even in Boston, they do not charge extra for 'ssam/ lettuce wrap' for the meats and for the salt/ sesame oil dip. This place charges an extra $2 for the lettuce, another $1 for the sesame oil sauce, and about $1.5 each for a bowl of rice. My husband dines like a True Korean, so he had to order those sides for a complete Korean BBQ meal. I found these surcharges to be very unappealing for a Korean restaurant and won't be coming back to this restaurant for this reason. It comes off as cheap and not allowing patrons to get the full Korean BBQ dining experience.   Quality of the meat is good, but portions are ridiculously small. The samgyupsal (pork belly) pieces are sliced very thin and contains much more fat than meat (not in an appealing way that typical pork belly fat to meat ratio contains).   Due to their current promotion of getting a free dessert for writing a review, I believe that the ratings here are highly skewed. The waitress reads your review on the spot then gives you a dessert. I highly doubt these reviewers here are writing an honest and thoughtful review of this place.",

When I say this is the BEST Korean BBQ I've ever had, I'm not just pulling your leg. We ordered the Premium for 6 people and there was SO MUCH FOOD and it was all incredibly delicious! Unless you can eat a cow, you'll definitely be having a ton of left over food. You also get a free dessert if you check-in (one time use for first time check-in) and I suggest the green tea ice cream macaroon. We all agreed we'd be coming back to this restaurant whenever we visit Vegas. We're all wishing there was a place like this in Denver. Gangnam Korean BBQ is seriously killing the game.",

My wife and I went, based on the reviews; it is located in a nondescript strip mall, thankfully my wife noticed it.   We arrived during happy hour.   We ordered a few items from the happy hour menu and a few off the regular menu.   We also had one of their specialty cocktails.   The food was good, some better than others.   We had the calamari, while tasty, it was a little dry and perhaps overcooked.   We also had some beef items based on the reviews and they were good.   The veggies were delicious.

Experience was not good at all.   The food is good. We got their number one seller Gangnam combo. Which would've been perfect but we never got our sides that came out with it. It says you get complimentary sides, and they just never came. We also ordered an extra side of rice, again never came. Basically when ever we ordered things, it either came out super late or not at all. Service is also slow and not attentive at all. I guess we made it inbetween shifts because near the end, we didn't see our waitress at all and a new server took the rest of our order. It wouldn't have been bad, but it would've been considerate to just let us know. We waited way too long for everything.   I will not be coming back purely because of the experience. Food was decent, but nothing to make me want to come back.",

Ordered 4 extra items: two meats, the beef and enoki,  and the mushroom plate and easily fed three people. My boyfriend, and now our friend, is still raving about the bulgogi bibim bap.",

We got the Gangnam set and you are able to substitute dishes that you don't want so that's a plus. For the amount of food we got, $65 isn't much. If we ordered them al carte, then it probably would've been even cheaper but we were really lazy and hungry.   The service was attentive. 5/5  The reason why I'm deducting a star is because the seats is far from the table making it uncomfortable while eating. Also it's super hot! Been to maybe Korean bbq spots were it was cool and refreshing to eat. Also maybe the music. I like the music but not what you really want to listen to while eating.  Probably won't come back. Nice spot to get full though.",

Delicious but a little too spicy for me. For my husband, it was he best dish we had. For sides, we had asparagus and zucchini. Simple but good.",

We had so many meat options, and all I can say is that the meats were so tender, and even without any dipping sauces, it had so much flavor.  The sides that came with were also super amazing.

Once inside, the decor was traditional for Asian cuisine. There was also a projection screen playing a combination of Asian and American pop videos which was pretty amusing.   There was a variety of menus options which was typical for Korean BBQ.  So if you've ever been to one of these places, the food is as good as you cook it.  I was surprised by the edamame...a buttery garlic delight. The green tea cheese cake was much better than expected.  The bottom line is that this place is pretty good and I would definitely come here again when in the mood for #cookedbyme cuisine.",

The waitress ignored us for several times and when we stopped her, she told us she is so tired and worked for more than 10 hours. Maybe this is another consequence after they faked the rate here.",

We ordered chicken karrage which was actually better than gyu-kaku so thats a huge plus! The harami miso melts in the mouth so that's another plus! The service was quick and everyone here has a smile on their face. 5 stars hands down. Definitely a place to check out if your craving korean/japaneese style food.   Tip to the owner: advertise on the strip and you will get way more customers, because this place is awesome!!   Food: 5 stars Service: 5 stars",

The meat was good, the pricing wasn't too bad for the quality, and they had a lot of options. Why I give this restaurant a 3 star is because of their service. Honestly, if their food was bad too, I would have given it a 1 star, but it wasn't so thank god. It wasn't all the servers, but this one korean server with glasses and kinda tall. God, he destroyed my groups experience. His demeanor was terrible, and he kept talking about extra charges, instead of just bringing us the extra bowl of rice like we asked. He even forgot about it after we ordered it. I really wanted to come back and like this place, but unless they fix that guys attitude, this place is going to lose a lot of customers",

(i got the coffee flavor and it was RIDIC.)   service was great; very attentive but barely noticeable throughout the meal. (ie: whenever we wanted a refill of something it was brought very quickly, our empty plates were quietly whisked away, when we asked for a fresh grill-top it was brought over immediately, etc.) considering it was a *very* busy Christmas Day service i'd say the staff ran like a well-oiled machine.   our total bill for the Meat Lover's package for 4 (with extra sides of asparagus & zucchini), plus chicken wings/dumplings/edamame at the bar, plus 1 beer, 2 bottles of soju, and 2 glasses of wine all came to $175 which is a pretty sweet deal imo. ($43/person + tip for a fully loaded Xmas dinner + enough booze that some of us had to Uber home? lol yes plz.)   my family had never been to a KBBQ before so i was very excited to introduce them to a new experience and Gangnam definitely delivered! everyone left fat and happy. :)",

Maybe we should have ordered the cooked bulgogi instead of the set menu Gangnam BBQ that we have to grill ourselves. I would probably return just to try out their cooked dishes, but will definitely check out other KBBQ resto first whenever we visit LV.",

Since nobody was there at that time he let us chose our own table. He was very friendly and answered all our questions about the menu. He recommended the bulgogi bibimbap to my husband and it was so good! I had the beef kalbi and beef belly. Loved the kalbi but not the belly. After dinner we had dessert. I ordered the friend banana tempura with strawberry ice cream and Man oh Man! Their banana tempura is the best of its kind! Better than PF Changs banana spring rolls. It's worth every calories! I'll probably come back just to order this. :)",

We went back on Saturday around 4:30 pm and had a 20 minute wait which was perfect considering when we were leaving the place was packed with people waiting again .    The reason this place is popular is because they serve small dish Korean BBQ so you can try a few more dishes which is especially great for 2 people eating at Korean BBQ . Service was really good and attentive although we didn't get our Korean sides until halfway through the dinner . The meats were good especially the duck breast . The cheesy corn was delicious and the enochi mushrooms were great . Overall one of my favorite KOBBQS in town and will be back !!",

    "text": "In Vegas on vacation and wanted a local favorite off strip.  After checking trusty ol Yelp, I found this place with 2800 reviews and an avg 4.5 stars...pretty easy decision to come here.  EDIT:** I now know why this place has 2800 reviews, if you tell them you are reviewing them on Yelp they will offer you free dessert. **  Right away, you notice this small restaurant has limited tables due to the nature of the way you prepare the food.  What an awesome time.  Come here with a group, sit around a table and order one of the packages.  They come with a feast!! Appetizers, kimchis, salads, rice and tons of meat.  Everything we tried was great...the bulgogi and the pork were my absolute favorite meats.  I also loved the seaweed salad and the different Kimchi.  The music, was an interesting choice to say the least...not sure it fits the atmosphere.  We came on a Sunday night and it was gangster rap...it made us literally laugh out loud because of how out of place it was in a place like this.  The price was also not bad at all.  It ended up after tax and tip being about $40 a person for the 3rd package option..I don't remember the name.  You can get it down to as low as $20 per person on the package if you wanted to leave a few things out.  I would absolutely come back here again.  We all had a great time!",

    "text": "After a packed day of wandering the Strip on a wedding trip to Vegas, we had worked up quite an appetite.  We had originally planned on going to Lotus of Siam, however upon arrival discovered that the wait was over an hour and they didn't have a liquor license - the combination of which, I am fairly certain, is a violation of the Geneva Convention.  We called an audible, wanted something close by, and stumbled upon Gangnam - which turned out to be a serendipitous find.   The wait time for a table was quoted at ~35 minutes, so we bellied up to the bar for some pre-meal drinks and appetizers - the chili dumplings, shishito peppers, and (one of my personal favorite appetizers) the dynamite shrimp.  The three dishes were perfect amount to share among the three of us, and we all enjoyed each one - the dynamite shrimp was especially a hit as neither of my friends had ever had it before.  We were seated almost immediately after on round of appetizers were polished off. I didn't check the time, but it had to be pretty close to the quoted wait time - an impressive feat, given that Korean BBQ is more prone to people lingering at tables given its interactive and social nature.  The menu features options for pre-built combos (containing a mix of starters, meats, and sides), however we opted for ordering a la carte so that we could each try specific items (and we had already had a round of appetizers).  I ordered the spicy pork and the Korean Prime Kalbi, as well as a bowl of sukiyaki noodles (beef).  The Kalbi was flavorful, tender, and easy to cook.  The spicy pork had excellent flavor and a nice kick, but I'm a bit paranoid about cooking pork so I probably over-did it a bit.  The sukiyaki noodle bowl was a perfect way to fill out the meal - much needed after a long day of walking around the strip.  The atmosphere was upbeat and we had a great time. All three of us left stuffed to the gills and all-in (with 3 appetizers, 2 beers each, our various BBQ selections, and my noodles) our bill came to just over $100 - a pretty fantastic deal for a great social meal.    I highly recommend Gangnam to cap your long Vegas day.",

The meats came out fairly quick, and were great. I do think they should've changed the grill throughout cause both of our grills were pretty charred halfway through eating. We asked for some rice and sauces, here and there but didn't get some stuff. I think the servers might've been too busy or forgot.

Pretty sad since the food was good. The happy hour is amazing of course 50% off drinks and almost $1 off certain food items. Will I be back? No. Considering me and my fiance gets off at 10 we considered this to be a good happy hour place but I guess not. Don't come in after 10 or else you'll be rushed to eat and finish",

I can imagine this place having ridiculously long waits during peak hours.   We just ordered off the happy hour menu which is such a great deal. My favorites were the beef toro, pork belly, and chicken karage. I didn't really like the cheesy wontons. You also get a free macaron if you purchase at least $15 and check in on yelp!

Perhaps Korean BBQ just isn't my thing, or perhaps I need to try more of it.  Our party ordered items a la carte which came out less expensive than the preselected combo platters and allowed for ordering exactly what we wanted.  We tried three beef and two chicken meat dishes, a few vegetables and some chicken fried rice. Everything was fairly tasty. I didn't love most of the side dishes that came complimentary, but was still grateful to be able to sample a bunch of different Korean tastes.   One of my favorite things was the ice cream macaroon at the end of the meal.   The servers were nice but it would have helped to have been given some direction as to what we should do and what sauces and sides would be well paired together since it was the first experience doing Korean BBQ for our entire party.",

First the good:   Fantastic seaweed salad and a very presentable mixed greens salad.  The spicy chicken wings are fantastic.  The sauces are a nice touch. Also the make waiter is great (female not too friendly).  The place seems clean and inviting.  I like the squid banchan but not as good as my daughter's  We got the 4 person meat lover.  It was the size we are used to for two people.  The brisket was tough and the shoulder was good.  The filet was flavorful but a little tough.  The banchan was generous. The pork belly is the thin type which is fine with me because I like it crispy. Asahi dark is a good compliment.  Dweji bul gogi is nice and tender and just the right spice.  Overall a very nice experience",

I like mixing it up when I go to gangnam especially during their happy hour after 10 pm.  Make sure to try the broccoli fondue, sweet corn and mushroom medley.  Only issue is the ventilation as I always leave gangnam with a smokey odor on my clothes.  Desserts are quite delicious so make sure to save some room for the decent variety.  Easy location to reach if you're near the strip as it's located across from the hard rock hotel.  Plenty of parking in the shopping center which has many places to check out.",

That explained the rating well for me.  I would have given it a 2 star if it was located in LA. But I believe different city should have different standards especially with Asian food.   The food itself wasn't that bad , it was random. The brisket definitely was the worst I ever had in any k bbq place. It was thick and watery.  Steam egg = 1/10.  Fried yakisoba = 2/10 - the noodle was edible , but the beef was not.  However to be fair, the other meat plates were good, especially the prime rib - one of the best I ever had in kbbq.   Now the service. There was no service. Never refilled our soda, never attempted to change our grill plate despite it being totally unusable, and I saw they saw how dirty it was, but they just passed by! If it was back in LA, the plate would have at least been changed 3-4 times.    So all in all, will never go back , and won't recommend to anyone who truly enjoys kbbq.",

    "text": "Loved the place because of it's unique concept and great flavors! We have been to Korean food joints before but this place was way different. Looking for a light lunch, we turned up at this place. It was happy hours and most of their menu was at half price! We ordered some soju to start off which was great - do try sometime! Got the Spicy Chicken Karaage which they give you seasoned and you cook on the grill at the table. It was very good and we ended up ordering it again.  Also do try their dumpling soup which is fantastic! We ordered a lot of those too. It's a real steal during the happy hours as the items are really cheap and it's great if you can go with a group - that way you can try a lot. Also, this place gives you a free smores if you review them there. Sure it's cheating to get those reviews coming but why would you not review just a great place. I would have reviewed anyway! Good place - do check out.",

    "text": "Short version: the best korean BBQ in Las Vegas, though not quite as good as Kang Ho Dong in LA (but then again, what is?).  Took my parents here for their anniversary, and again came back a few days ago with my friend. It is very well situated on Paradise and Harmon, in a plaza with lots of parking and easy access. The establishment is clean and well lit, unlike some of the all-you-can-eat korean BBQ's around here. Staff were kind and helpful, and often go out of their way to help you even when times are busy. The grills are also clean, and appear well maintained. The only thing that I wished they did more was that the staff cooked the meats for you, like Kang Ho Dong, so that the meats are perfectly cooked if you're not very experienced in cooking yourself. That being said, our server was kind enough to go out of his way to cook for us several times.  We ordered the premium prix fixe for 4 ($160), which comes with the following:  Starter Kobe Beef Carpaccio - was absolutely delicious. I'm not usually a fan of carpaccio, but they marinated the meat very well. It was a bit oily I thought, but the flavor was just right. My parents are not crazy about raw meat, so I pretty much finished all of it by myself.  Tuna Poke - standard poke  Fresh Oyster - was surprisingly good. Fresh without hints of fishiness. I didn't get any bits of the shell at all, which is nice because a lot of other places have it. They put some tobiko and small amount of what I think is sriracha on it, which I think really enhances the flavor.  Green Salad - standard salad  Shrimp Bibimbap - standard bibimbap  Miso Soup - standard miso soup  BBQ dishes Kobe Style Beef - was very good, but I personally don't like my meat this fatty.  Korean Prime Kalbi - The second best after the harami miso. It was very well marinated and the meat was just the right amount of chewiness and texture. I heard the regular prime kalbi (non marinated) is even better, and will have to try it next time I come.  Harami Miso - absolutely fantastic, the best out of the meats I've had. The marinate was perfect, not too salty. The meat was amazing, a perfect combination of meat and fat. It will just melt in your mouth, then allow you to roll your eyes back and moan.  Filet Mignon - was a good filet, but I thought there were better meats. The cut was kind of large for my liking, which takes awhile to cook. It was very lean but still tender.  Scallop - typical scallop  Shrimp - typical shrimp. I was kind of surprised that they have shrimp here, but I'm guessing they're trying to do the \"surf and turf\" thing with their meats.  Asparagus/mushrooms - the enoki mushroom was actually very good. They come precooked inside a wrapped foil, but you can heat it up some more on top of the grill. It was a bit too much butter for my own taste.  Since the table is not setup with ssamjang (korean spicey dipping sauce), and gireumjang (sesame and salt dipping sauce) I recommend that you ask for it. The standard 3 flavors they set up for you is good, but I thought the ssamjang and gireumjang brought out the meat's flavor more.  We also got the macaron ice cream sandwiches at the end, and they were also very good. I liked the vanilla flavor most.  Overall, I was very pleased with my experience. I will never go back to the all-you-can-eat korean BBQ's here in town again after this. It is totally worth the money, and even then it's very fairly priced. Will definitely come back time after time!",

The interior of the place is decorated modern and has 2 flat screens to watch your fave sporting event. Each table has a grill to cook your food. My Hawaiian waitress was friendly and sweet but for a Korean joint I was disappointed the only banchan you receive is Kim chi. I ordered shrimp with head on and sliced prime rib beef. My order  didn't include miso soup and steamed rice so there was an up charge. I did enjoy the three dipping sauces for the entrees which were ponzu, sweet and a spicy sauce. The beef was tender but it was a only 4 ounces for $11.95 The shrimp was decent but was priced at $5.95 for 4 pcs and were on the small side and I've had fresher.  Overall I thought the decor and service was solid, but the food fell short on value and quality and don't think I would return.",

The bibimbap is also delicious although smaller than other korean rest. I've been.  Bulgogi bibimbap was really flavorful too.  Nice atmosphere.",

    "text": "This place is freaking legit!  Coming from California, this place is easily one of the best I've had. The wait was a bit long but that's expected for any Korean spot that's this good. We had the Premium dinner set. I wanted to try their best cuts and you actually save some money by going with the preset meal rather then ordering them individually; trust me I did the calculations.  They also said that the portions were the same whether you order through the set meal for the individual dishes. I don't think any place has authentic Kobe beef in America but this place has the Kobe style beef which was really really good here. If you haven't tried that type of beef you should definitely try it once in your lifetime.  All four of the different meats that came with the meal were all really good so I would recommend you try the filet mignon first otherwise if you eat that last you will be disappointed. The tuna pokey was also really good and so was the beef carpaccio. The meal also came with different dipping sauces to go with the meat and all of them were very good. My wife also said that the salad was really good, I ate a little and I would agree. Even the asparagus came out really well, not overcooked. They put it in foil and cook it in butter and you can taste it. The side dishes are just OK. The bibimbap wasn't that great, the rice wasn't that crispy. All in all, one of the better Asian places in Las Vegas. Service was very good as should be expected in any Korean joint.",

    "text": "Staff is super nice. Great staff. I only ordered the brisket (beef tomo, I think). I'm all about the brisket when I go kbbq'ing. I didn't like it. Not to say the quality isn't good, I just like my kbbq brisket to be thin, like 1/2-1/3 of the cut here. Fatty too, the meat here, to me, is pretty lean. Definitely not the type I was expecting. It's more like a slice of steak. I don't know if it's any fault of the food here, but I eat pretty fast and I was in and out in 30 minutes from sitting to exiting. My hotel is half a mile away, I almost didn't make it... Before I even exited the plaza I needed to number two baaaaaaaaad.  I'm so glad I was being lazy and drove l rather than walked. I would of liked to try the Kobe meat as the pictures other posted looks great, but after this close call I think I'll play it safe.  Oh and the cream cheese wontons, I liked!!!",

Horrible service! One waitress actually smiles and the other one acted like we Are there to eat without paying. We had to ask for refill / new drinks. The server wasn't attentive at all. Throughout the stay, she came by maybe 4 times and that's just to drop off food. We constantly have to ask for her to bring us stuff (drinks, napkins, bill, and change).   I work at a restaurant so I know how gratuity work.  Restaurants usually charge gratuity for table of 6 or more. And I'm pretty sure my group isn't a table of 6.  I usually don't care if you add gratuity to my check because that save me the time of calculating. But with this service, our waitress clearly did not deserves $25 tip considering how horrible of a service it was.  We could have complaint but we're not about to missed our flight. Thanks for the food gangnam and we will tell our friends to never come here due to your rude server.",

I'd recommend sticking to the bulgogi and steaks.  I found their chicken, shrimp and anything meat wise to be ok. I like getting extra lettuce to wrap meat in, mushroom medley and broccoli fondue if you want a different kick in eating broccoli.  The other things that were ok was the macaroon (too old in that freezer so it was a bit stiff and way too sugary) and sauteed shishito peppers (we can make it better).  Overall, definitely a place we keep coming back to.  Service is a mix between ehh and decent depending on how tired or disgruntled the waitor/-ress is that day.

After being promptly seated and minor hemming and hawing over the menu, we decided to order the meat lover's combo for 2, a hot sake, and beer for sake bombs to start our weekend. Between 3 people, we opted for the combo for 2 because we figured we could always order more and didn't want to get too gluttonous by ordering the combo for 4.   First came the booze, then the side dishes, then all of the meat. The grill heats up very quickly, however it is only hot in the middle and burns the meat rather quickly. Also, don't bother with the onions and assorted sliced veggies; they will burn too. Those aside, my favorite was the spicy pork. Everything else was decent, but not standout. The side dishes are standard and decent too, but the waiters did not come to refill them until we flagged them down.  Their sound system is not very good. They alternated between old school hip hop/R&B and Kpop, which are both my jam but the low sound quality actually irked me a bit.   Given the many options for dining in Vegas, I likely wouldn't come back here unless I had a huge hankering for kbbq when in town.",

The man at the front was very helpful and polite when I kept asking him how much longer.   We had never been to a Korean bbq before so we had a little trouble with figuring out how to grill the meat. The chef came out to help us multiple times and told us when to flip the meat and how to arrange the meat on the grill. He also came and cut the meat for us when he realized we were struggling a little bit with eating it. All the staff were extremely friendly and the service is very speedy.  The waiter came and checked on us multiple times and refilled our water constantly   We started our meal with the edamame which is a great way to offset the oiliness of the meat. The meat was so juicy and tender. I wanted to splurge a bit and get the kobe which was pretty expensive but it was definitely worth it. We ordered almost every one of the bbq beef options and they were all delicious in their own way. My favorite was the pork belly and the Kobe.   The portions are reasonably sized for their price, and it's a little pricy but at the end of the meal I definitely felt that it was worth it. Don't forget to get that free macaron ice cream by checking in! It was a nice way to end the meal.",

    "text": "I just cannot believe this place has 4.5 stars review.  Before starting off, I'd like to mention that I don't normally write a review on yelp but this time I had to. I used to work in restaurant industry for quite a long time and have tried out pretty much every Korean bbq place in Las Vegas. And so far, this one has the worst service ever.  There's a security convention going on at sands expo this week and today was the second day during the session. My two customers, who visited Vegas all the way from south Korea for this significant show, wanted to try Korean food for lunch and I came up with Gangnam. I've never tried at this place before however, I was recommended by my friends a couple of times. And its location is also close by the convention center so I though Gangnam would be a great choice for us. With high expectations we made our decision to go eat at Gangnam not knowing how terrible this place actually is.  When we walked in, it was around 1:30pm and there was about 4 tables filled which was not busy at all. As we got seated, a server who was Korean came up to our table and asked if we wanted to order. (By the way I was the one that ordered with the servers and asked for them because my customers were not familiar with American restaurant culture) I asked her about the menu selection and she explained how it works, how the meats and foods come out. We first placed three orders of pork belly(ala karte), three bowls of rice, two different kinds of stew, and a glass of bear. After we ordered, meats and side dishes came out quickly, but we were still waiting for the beer and stew for quite a long time. So I had to look for the server and remind her about the beer. According to her respond, she seemed to have forgotten to bring it and she couldn't even remember what kind of beer we ordered. I could kinda understand her because sometimes you forget things when you don't pay high attention to it. Okay but what annoyed me the most was since we got seated she NEVER checked up on our table NOT EVEN ONE TIME till the very last minute we finished our food and left the restaurant. Wow she could've asked us at least once if everything was okay or if we wanted to order something else. But she didn't AT ALL! There were two other male servers working at the hall too but every time I tried to ask for any of them they were like nowhere to find. Maybe they were all in the kitchen and doing some back up stuff?? But excuse me, can we just get some spoons please???  And I really want them to learn how to make an eye contact with customers so that people can let them know when they need some help. They didn't even try to make an eye contact with me or show up to our table except for when dropping off some foods that we ordered earlier. Even though they came to our table to serve food, they dropped whatever they have on their hands and just walked away!! My salad ran out after eating the half of the meal and of course none of them even noticed. I didn't want to ask them because I saw one of the guys look very annoyed when I asked him to change a grill. They just didn't care about what we need more than messing around at a register.  I ended up leaving the restaurant very upset with my customers. Now I assume that they didn't want to care about us because we don't look from here and they probably thought we wouldn't complain or feel offended anyways. And that's what makes me even angrier. Well you cannot decide if you're going to give a customer good service or not by their appearance.  I feel so sorry to my customers for suggesting this restaurant. I can't explain enough how embarrassed and mad I was during the whole meal.  Well thanks for giving us a terrible experience, Gangnam. I would NEVER go back or recommend this place!!!!!!",

I probably went wrong in walking in here for the purpose of eating this soup, since it's a meat specialty place.   The menu, decor, and set-up totally reminded me of GYU-KAKU. Even the little details like the color of the plates and their logo. I got to try some meats off of a set menu, and the meat quality was quite impressive. They have good meats, if you're willing to shell out the price for it.   As for the yook gae jang and soon tofu, it tasted like salt with no other flavor, and totally was ruined in my opinion. The side dishes however were good.   Service was slow, despite the restaurant only being half full. I had to ask for water and certain side dishes multiple times to get it.",

    "text": "When looking for a very well deserved alternative to the wondrous world of ayce joints in Vegas, we opted to try this highly rated and mega reviewed spot.  And guess what? it was hella good.  Not that you really had to guess since my four star rating clearly indicates I liked it. Oh Dan B, your redundancies grow more and more with each passing day. Anyways.  First of all, what looks to be a fairly standard strip mall restaurant from the outside takes on a very unexpected turn once you step inside and behold a very sleek, modern, and spacious layout.  What really got my attention was the absence of the billowing smoke wafting around tables when people are grilling - it's something I both fondly and annoyingly associate with most Asian BBQ places.  The staff was super attentive from the get go and really helpful when it came to best deciphering which combination of set menus and a la cart items would yield the best sampling of what Gangnam had to offer.  And I have to tell you the selection, quality, and flavor of the meats we grilled were impressive: tender, well seasoned, and fresh.  The servings aren't necessarily huge, but it needn't be when it's that good and so reasonably priced that ordering extra isn't too exorbitant.  Overall, Gangnam has to be one of the best BBQ experiences I've had in awhile: great food and drink, stylish decor, and somewhere my little one would enjoy going. It's also helps reminds me how nice / necessary it is to take a break from buffets every once in awhile.",

The food comes real fast and before you know it, you're done. But with plenty of leftovers. Wagyu was nicely fresh and marbled, but tough.  The salad was awesome and fresh.  Shrimp was so so, kimchis were also so so.  Very Americanized meal.  Seating in the booths was very uncomfortable. So if there is an other option, I suggest you choose a table. Booths have very hard wooden seats with semi soft backing that was also WAY too far away from the table. Awkward seating situation that made us squirm through the meal.  They promote that you get a free dessert if you rate them on Yelp, which I think, contributes to the ratings here. They don't require a high rating, but would you eat a dessert after you show them that you just gave them a bad review? Nope.",

Food was really good here and if you order right, Happy Hour can save you money! Not for us bc we ordered too much. Haha...and catered for non-Koreans a bit more. Everything is a la carte or you can get combo deals for 2.  Beef Toro- slightly thicker than I am used to compared to L.A. places. Wasnt that great in tenderness or flavor so not sure what the good reviews are for.  Gave us more than expected and couldnt finish all 3 HH orders.  Pork belly- was decent and only finished 2 HH orders of it.  Dwenjang jigae (bean paste soup)- a bit sweet and less salty than Im used to but was good. Not a huge bowl but enough to share as a side to meats. Know that this takes longer to make so it doesnt come out right away! Rice - only 1 comes with soup order but they give a decent amount. Also got a bowl of brown rice.  Should've just shared the one bowl. Udon- good variety and amount of tempura. Would get tempura on the side if u like it crispy and not all soggy.  -Spicy tuna kimbap- was yummy! Started with this (not on HH menu). 4 little deep fried rolls of plain rice in toasted seaweed but yummy cubes of tuna in spicy mayo sauce all over. Yummy!! Everything is a la carte...side of green onions in sweet  vinegar  (pretty good), lettuce and bean paste sauce, rice...just ask bc it probably is extra, unless u ger a combo.  -side dishes were decent and refillable if i get ar leadt 2 orders of bbq meat per person?  -If we ordered less at first and waited to see how much came out, we wouldve saved a good amount during Happy Hour. Would have stuck with 2 HH orders of meat for each person and share one bowl of rice. GOOD SERVICE TOO! -Can also get free macarons for yelping but didnt do that.  :)",

I think this restaurant is in my top 5 of all time. Basically, you select your meats and seafoods and they bring them to your table - portions are similar to what you'd get at a Tapas place.  You grill the foods at your table.  Some of the dishes are cooked in the kitchen, but pretty much the meats are all grilled by you, at your table. This food was absolutely some of the most delicious food I've ever eaten!  Anywhere! The quality was outstanding.

Other thing like clean cooking environment, good service and sanitary bathroom make it better than your average Korean BBQ place.  I'd go back here with family.

Firstly this place doesn't cook the meat for you like other places, secondly they only have 6 dishes of banchan when their menu shows 8. Thirdly they don't give free desserts with the combo meals.  The place was decent but doesn't deserve 5 stars as the service was slow and I don't like cooking my own meat at Korean BBQ places.  Do not think I will return.",

I was concerned that my clothes would later notify my entire plane that I ate KBBQ for dinner, but I was surprised to leave odorless! They take their ventilation fans here seriously, people. I even saw a guy standing on the chairs to wipe fans down after people left.  Anyways, we got Gangnam Style for four people at an affordable price ($120), which included tender meats and a plethora of side dishes. Service was impressively rapid; all the food was out within ten minutes after ordering. As for taste, maybe my expectations were too high, but I wasn't blown away by anything in particular. For me, this Americanized, trendy style of Korean BBQ is less satisfying than the AYCE style Korean BBQ places I can find in California. Their playlist was also a strange mix of kpop and American pop/rnb.  Bottom Line: I left with a full belly and a free macaron for checking in on Yelp, but I don't expect to be back anytime soon.",

We ended up just picking what we wanted to try which was the better option for us. We really enjoyed all the meat options especially the waygu carpaccio, marinated galbi, filet mignon and more! The meats tasted fresh. The sides were typical of any other other Korean barbecue place but I really enjoyed the macaroni salad the most!   The service was excellent and quick. Highly recommend!

For my entire life until now, I thought the Korean food in Toronto was already the best outside of Korea, but this restaurant surprisingly exceeds the Korean food in Toronto! The prices are very decent and the portions are huge!   We ordered the Las Vegas set for 2 and it was more than enough for 2 people! The bbq also came with some side dishes from kimchi to macaroni salad to deep fried cheese dumplings!   We tried the mango and strawberry macaron ice cream for dessert (free with Yelp check-in). I love macarons and ice cream, so this dessert satisfies both my cravings at once!  Not only is the food very good, but the service is also excellent! Never in my life did I have the server mix the bibimbap for us!   Usually, after eating kbbq in a restaurant, my entire outfit and myself smells like the food, but here, there is no smell at all! There is a ventilation right above the grill that captures all the smell.  I'm for sure coming back before I leave and for my many Vegas trips to come!",

The wait was originally an hour but several groups cancelled cause of the wait and my group was kindly welcomed by the attentive host. The restaurant's interior is very clean and modern with Kpop music videos playing on a projector by the waiting area. Some food I don't recommend are the pork fried dumplings (tasted like they were defrosted and lacked flavor) and the bacon wrapped white vegetable/mushroom (inside was way too chewey and tough). Something that tasted odd to me, but another member of my group enjoyed was the bell peppers included with the Bulgogi. Overall, I would definitely recommended this restaurant and I noticed many of the customers were Korean too.",

That place is good as well! Sorry for the side track, back to this amazing BBQ place. We had meat lovers for 2 for lunch. Wow it was for meat lovers for sure because there were plenty of meats for 2. The banchans were good and generous.  The filet mignon was definitely not as good compared to Niwa BBQ that I had in Dallas, TX. I would rather have quality over quantity. And another cut which I forgot the name (long slim cuts) didn't have the fresh taste. As I was chewing it, the taste felt like it's been out for a while and the meat started to have a smell. Didn't like it.  But over all for Vegas, this place is decent.  The complimentary Yelp check in macaron ice cream coffee flavor was amazing. I want to come back for more of that ice cream.  Our server was very nice, always a smile on his face. Thank you.  Plenty of parking spots because it's located in a strip mall..",

This isn't an ayce kbbq place, but i was pretty full from the amount of food that we ordered.   We ordered the 2 person kbbq set, which came with 5 cuts of meat, oysters, corn, grilled mushrooms, unlimited banchan, and bulgolgi bibimbap.   The service here is really friendly and welcoming. They help you to cut your meat and cook it if you want.  I prefer my meat to barely touch the grill so i prefer cooking my meat myself.   The cuts were on the smaller side, so if you have a huge appetite or are super hungry you should probabaly order more.  I really liked the side salad they had, the dressing was really refreshing and light.  The bulgolgi bibimbap was too sweet for me, and i dont think i would order it again .   Good place to come,  if you are near the strip /airport, otherwise there are alot more affordable ayce kbbq places in vegas.",

Open til 1am! Bring all your friends. Food was average, kind of lacking in flavor. Our bibimbap that comes with the combo took forever to come out, we really wanted to enjoy it with our meats. I wish the beef brisket was sliced thin. We just the \"LAS VEGAS\" combo for 2 people. I love how they give you the korean side dishes (banchan) especially the cuttlefish!    I couldn't wait to try it, now I did, and now I'll move on. I'll stick to my gyu-kaku and tofu hut. It wasn't bad, it was like I said average. Great to bring out of town guest.

That made me feel like they are a cheapskate and the prices started to feel pricier.  They should research on what Yagyu offers for lunch... Yagyu is much better in all aspects - food quality, portion and prices. While what Gangnam offers is decent, I fail to find a reason to go back.

We cooked it to crispy. The filet mignon was meh. Would skip. We also got the king oyster mushroom. It was aight.   Get the prime kalbi. So good. So fat. So worth.

Vegetables we ordered (mushrooms and asparagus) were already cooked when they brought it to our table, so that was nice. We went around 3, so not many people. Service was great. It's s little pricey by San Diego standards but probably on point for Vegas. It's right across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel.",

From the happy hour menu my boyfriend and I ordered the  cream cheese wonton $3 spicy tuna kimbap $3 Ordered all 3 meat $3 each (pork taro, beef brisket, and bulgogi) and a pitcher of Sapporo beer for $9.  Everything was delicious I feel like the bulgogi, tuna kimbap, cream cheese wonton was our personal favorite. The bulgogi was very tasty but kindve small in portion so would recommend order of 2 instead of one.  We decided not to go with the set combo menu and order a la carte of marinated galbi, side of lettuce and paste wrap (comes with celery), and raw garlic as the side dish to make a Korean version taco (aka \"Saam\")   Overall the place is very clean, attentive servers, good quality food and affordable price range for everyone (can do set combo meals or a la carte). It may not be the best Korean bbq I've ever had but the quality and the chill ambiance is nice for the Vegas area. Had a pleasant experience and would come back again.",

The kids love the pork belly and we love the toro and bulgogi. Refillable side dishes are delish. The enoki mushroom is really fresh tasting and healthy so it offsets all the meat you're about to devour. The steamed egg looks just like the picture! My only wish is that they served rice paper with the meat. It would make the meal over the top! The restaurant is really nice and the bathrooms are clean. Overall a great, well-rounded experience!",

Its a delicious meal and lots of fun with a social group for a competitive price. The nature of the meal does make it a bit loud though, so keep that in mind.

Despite being envious of the sights and smells that came afterwards, I was happy with my order of veggie ramen and bimbimbap.  When the ramen first came, the noodles looked like they came from an instant ramen package. When I taste the salty sour broth though, I was happy and let the noodles continue soaking the broth and focus on my Sapporo. Once the noodles were completely hydrated, it was delicious.  So was my bimbimbap. I didn't notice any tofu and it didn't have an egg either but still flavourful without any obvious protein. Not only was my meal filling. It was cheap. My large ramen noodle bowl was about 6 dollars while my rice bowl was 8. I can't say no to large cheap portions of tasty food.",

The meat selection is quite extensive, and the \"Kobe style\" was actually pretty good. The fried calamari, and marinated short ribs and spicy pork, were actually very tasty.  I would call this upscale and twist, as far as the restaurant very nicely laid out with her every single table in the corner was very clean and atmosphere was very mellow for a New York/Las Vegas style restaurant. I would call this fancy, I wouldn't necessarily call it good for kids, but if you've never been to the Korean barbecue place, The authenticity, and the experience of cooking your own meat in the grill in front of you on the table is very very fun. With over 1200 reviews and many more photographs, and I'm feeling like this place is a hit, even being off the strip. A good place for locals, and definitely a place I'd recommend to those traveling.",

    "text": "Terrible customer service at this PDQ store . Will not be back . Went in for the first time . Saw a posted sign at the register advertising a three peice tender combo meal for $5 bucks .  I clearly pointed to the sign and told the cashier I would have the $5 combo special.  She rang up my order and charged me $7.46 . I took the food to my table and looked at the receipt thinking the combo special probably didn't include the soda . But why would soda be an extra $2. 46 ?    I told the cashier I thought the combo was $5 dollars ? She said \" oh that special starts at 7 pm . I asked her to tell me the time since I didn't wear a watch . It was 6:48 pm . I asked her if she could reimburse the difference . I had assumed it was already 7 pm (my fault ) .  She went to get someone else . The manager ? Shift supervisor ? Obviously someone who was in charge .  I explained that it was my fault for not knowing the proper time . But since I had clearly pointed to the sign when placing the order , I should've been told that it was 12 minutes too early to receive that special . In a not so friendly manner told me he was unable to refund the difference. I asked him if I didn't like the taste of the food or if the food was too cold would he refund the entire price ? He said yes . So I then told him the food was cold and he gave me a very slow and drawn out refund for the entire amount . Plus then he took the plate of food which I had already handled and put it neatly back on the kitchen where I'm assuming he planned on re selling it . ( health code violation) . So for the difference of $2 dollars and 12 minutes in time ... He would rather refund the Entire price of the meal , and also lose a customer forever ? No problem . This is Las Vegas and we have many different  choices on each block to choose from.  The reason I give ONE Star and will never come back is the poor customer service combined with him not throwing away the food I had already handled .",

I like to roll my meat in either rice paper or radish or both and clear my pallets with the condiments. This place, although the service was good, the food taste was not bad, but the lack of the essential Korean food restaurant experience was a turn down. For example, they don't have rice paper, radish, seaweed etc. Some of you might say that is not for you, understandable but it should be an option for some people. Anyway, if you like a relaxing experience and not picky about the food experience so much, this place maybe for you..",

The bbq wasn't warm enough, they didn't provide scissors to cut meat, the seasoning was just ok.  They meat was not cut appropriately.  They brought 3 glasses of water to 5 person table.

Don't get me wrong, the food was absolutely delicious. The pitcher of sangria was absolutely amazing. The price for the amount of food you get when you order off of their combos was definitely decently priced, but the service... my visit was at 1:00PM on a Friday and there was 1 table  with guests dining there. We walked in and kind of stood by the door waiting for someone to come greet us. It seems like the entire staff was on their break or something. Perhaps I am not with the Vegas lifestyle, and people don't come in to eat at 1:00 PM? Maybe we missed the lunch rush? Was no one working? It took a bit for someone to seat us. After we sat down, it was like they forgot we were there. We had to get up and find someone to explain the menu, take our order, change our grill, and re-fill our water. This place is definitely delicious, but service at 1:00 PM was not the fast and friendly service I had read in all these reviews.",

So my expectations were high to begin with, but we were on our way back from Los Angeles dining at best Korean restaurants, so Kangnam could have been at a big disadvantage.   Nonetheless, hands-down best BBQ as well as other foods!  You can truly expect top quality meats, sauces,  foods as well as exceptional service by best looking staff!    We went there after 2 weeks long road trip with toddlers.  As soon as we walked in my sons were acting up from being cooped in the car all day.  The staff promptly sat us in a private room so we were able to dine without worrying about interrupting other guests. Huge kudos to them since it was Friday night and place was packed.    Then one of my sons threw up all over me!  and again the staff immediately came with napkins and made sure we were ok.  Super attentive and kind folks!  During our meal I think staff rotated and quietly checked up on us dozen times.  Just making sure we had everything but without interrupting our meal.    The night started out rough, chaotic with kids and vomit but we all left the restaurant stuffed and extremely satisfied.  I would give them more than 5 stars if there was an option!  This place triumph the best Los Angeles Korean places we visited by quality of food and service!",

    "text": "Talk about cream of the crop meats! This is my favorite food spot in Vegas aside from Bacchanal. This is pretty close to the strip. Be warned that there will almost be a pretty long wait, I feel like its always understaffed and there's this one younger guy who works his butt off. When we were there he answered phones, rang up customers, grabbed foods, bussed tables, changed out grills, he pretty much did everything. I felt bad for him because he really was working super hard. Anyways, the food here is AMAAZINGGG. I love their Hirami Miso, you must try it. Also their steamed eggs is out of control, like MASSIVE in size, it's an overflowing fluff when they bring it out. And it's not all fluffly and airy like most steamed eggs. This thing is dense and could be shared with 2-3 people even. I don't particularly care to get appetizers or other items aside from the meat here.",

Servers are amazing, attentive, and every time  I visit there, they have a great quality of meat compared to the price range that are paying. They are usually around $7 range per meat, if party of 2 is going here, you should expect to pay around $35-40 which I believe that it is reasonable. This place is like the place I come every time I am craving some KBBQ. Yeap, and please make a review about this place by the time you are dining here, they will give you comp macaroon ice cream no matter how you write your review.",

The menu says they are for 2 people but we had a group of 4 and the combo filled us all.  You can always add one or two items a la carte if you are still hungry.  The meat is surprisingly well marbled and tender and fresh.  The sauces are perfect compliments to the meet.  I thought the salad was a little bit of an afterthought as it was mostly lettuce but we still ate it. Our favorite was the bulgogi bibambap.  The service felt a little off as they had a difficult time understanding and we were very conscious that they were watching us the whole time.  I understand it is your job to clear our table as we finish a plate but there are ways to be less intrusive about it. Also, they were fixing a light in the restaurant while we were all there.  Still, this place is very enjoyable and reasonably priced.",

We tried the stir fried sukiyaki veggie udon noodles, spicy garlic edamame, mushroom medley, BBQ rib eye, and the Korean honeyeyed pancake with ice cream.  Everything was so incredibly tasty. The sauce on the udon noodles was so delicious and the veggies were fresh and cooked to perfection. The edamame was the perfect appetizer. I would definitely recommend to give this place a try.

I ordered the bulgogi bibimbap, and was sadly disappointed with the selection. It was rice and bulgogi....that was it. The waitress came by and she even look as displeased at me. What was surprising was that she didn't do anything about it, which was saddening. I can't say that it was their fault, since that's what I ordered, but if a customer looks dissatisfied it should raise an alarm to do something about it! Learn from this, the restaurant has potential.",

    "text": "So, we came here on a whim, having resolved to try all the various places in the area.  We walked in at 6:30 PM on a Saturday, and the place was a ghost town.  One other couple at a table.  The cheerful staff seated us promptly, and equipped us with menus.    The usual suspects on the beer list, plus a few oddballs which made for nice variety, and also a choice of sakes and other asian alcoholic beverages.  For those of you unfamiliar with the asian BBQ style of dining (as I was) each table has a small gas grill set in its center (and exhaust hoods with fire extinguisers set above them).  Each place setting comes equipped with a pair of tongs.  You order off the menus small (4 oz) batches of raw meat, and then grill them at the table.  It is not quite like Benihana, in that 1) there is not a chef doing entertainment-cooking in front of you, and 2) you are not in a mixed party.  Our waitress did come by from time to time to flip the meat , and to cut it with scissors so that it could be eaten with chopsticks.  The service was quite prompt and pleasant.  The interior of the restaurant was nicely finished, although the 2-person bench seats on each side of the table are so heavy that it makes it difficult to manhandle them into a comfortable position.    The grilled dumplings were tasty; but oddly my girlfriend's less expensive beef tasted markedly superior to my pricer order.    One thing that was irksome were the televisions.  They were showing women's college softball on ESPN 8 or something, and it was just annoying and distracting, cheapening the feel of what was otherwise a refined restaurant.  Why anyone installs TV's in restaurants other than sports bars is beyond me.    The food was ok without being great.  Nothing that made me say \"we HAVE to come here again!\"  Prices seemed fair ($50 for the 2 of us, including tip, and we ate pretty well).  I admit I am terrible at using chopsticks, and so getting food into my mouth without making a mess is a challenge.  I didn't ask if they had forks, knives, spoons, but I was thinking about it.  When we left, we were the only patrons.  I wonder if Gangnam BBQ will be able to dial up their food to match the good service and beautiful interior.  I will be rooting for them, but don't know how soon I will be rushing back.",

Their sauces (ponzu, sweet, or spicy) are yummy, but even if you're not a fan, their meat is perfectly marinated already (we got the bulgogi). All the waiters/esses are super cute and helpful, and they will notice if you are leaving your meat on the grill for a long time and adjust the fire level for you accordingly. The cheese wontons were delicious, and so was the honey pancake. Although, don't expect it to be textured like western pancakes- it is much sweeter, stickier and eggier.",

The menu is extensive and it's a la carte  style. The prices are worth it. The meat is very high quality compared to some of the all you can eat kbbq  places. There's also a drink and spirits menu.  I recommend the marinated kalbi  steak, it's very tender and juicy. Also, try the bacon  wrapped sparagus, it's crunchy and crispy at the same time.  Very appropriate place for a date or a group gathering. Not recommended if you're single haha  The service was great, atleast 5 people came by multiple times to make sure that we were properly serviced.

    "text": "I came here for happy hour (3-6pm, 10pm- close) based on all the great reviews. We called ahead to try to make a reservation, and were told that they don't take same day reservations but they weren't busy at the time so we came in anyways.   We ordered beef toro, bulgogi, pork belly, and mushroom medley. We also had the chicken wings, fried calamari, and jalapeno poppers for apps. Each dish was $4 with the exception of the mushrooms ($2). The meats were really good quality, and my favorite was the bulgogi which was really tender and had a great marinade. The chicken wings were average, crispy but pretty bland. The poppers were filled with cream cheese and salmon with a tempura batter. The calamari were okay as well, but the breading was disappointingly flavorless, much like the chicken wings. The dipping sauce that came with it added some much needed flavor to the dish.  The service was relatively spotty. We were seated immediately and our waiter took our order quickly. Afterwards however it was kind of difficult to get anyone's attention as the restaurant became more busy, so we had to flag down someone each time we needed something. Our appetizers also came out way after the meats, so we were pretty much done with our food by the time our last appetizer came out.  Also keep in mind rice is not included when you order dishes a la cartel for happy hour. It's $2 for a bowl and 1 bowl is enough for 2 to share.  I must admit though that I think the reviews for this place are somewhat inflated because they give you a free desert if you write and show them a posted Yelp review. To avoid the inevitable awkwardness associated with showing your server an low or average review and the fact that you are getting a free desert, I feel like people naturally give this place a higher review than they normally would. Definitely wouldn't expect this place to be averaging 4.5 stars.  Overall Gangnam Asian BBQ is a solid restaurant for your Asian BBQ fix while in Vegas.",

    "text": "Ehhh... found this place mediocre for an Asian BBQ experience. I was really iffy on going here because it was a fusion of both Japanese and Korean. Off the bat, I already felt like it wasn't going to be an authentic food experience. But I got there at the time of happy hour that started at 10 pm so I said, why not?! To start off I got a salad and tried their tteokbokki. The salad looked very different from the one picture on the menu. It had bitter lettuce, which I try to avoid in a salad at all cost. As for the meats, we tried their brisket (Toro?), bulgogi, and pork belly. I found that the meat was cut too thick, which made it difficult to bite through. On the upside, the staff was really nice and accommodating. Oh! And if you check- in, you get a free ice cream, which was a nice treat!",

Also, the weird knock-off rap videos on a projector (the songs were real, but I don't think it was really the artists...looked like some celebrity look-alikes); just didn't get how this fit in a place like this.

The wait was about 20 mins for 2 of us (There were 4 parties ahead of us) We got sat on a huge table towers the back. We decided to order individual items since I didn't like everything I saw in the combos. It was a great choice because we got to try everything we wanted. Nothing went to waste.  Our favorites: beef bulgogi, spicy pork, enoki bacon. The flat iron garlic was good, meat was very tender but lack in flavor. They do give you 3 dipping sauces for your meats.  We also got the Korean marinated short rib. Flavor is similar to the beef bulgogi, meat was tender.  For the price difference I would just stick with beef bulgogi at $3.95 instead of the other two mentioned above that cost $8.95.  Sides included: cucumber, Kim chi, sweet onion/daikon, weird spicy noodle dish (not our fave), Mac and cheese salad. Husband ordered the steamed egg, it looks really big but not as fluffy and airy like the one from Tofu Hut.  I ordered the house salad. I liked the variety of mixed greens and cherry tomatoes, Lao came with an egg cut in half. The dressing sauce had a hint of orange citrus flavor, yummy.  Service was decent. They switched the grill out as soon as it was black.   Stick with the marinated items if you like flavor in your meats.   Our total came out to be $58.   Will definitely return.",

The only downside was it seemed the grill wasn't oil'd enough, we kept having to ask to get our grill changed-- which they were very efficient in doing. However, I've been to other bbq places and don't ever recall having to swap out grills that much.   Also, we checked in on yelp and got a free green tea macaroon and OMG(!) it was worth every bite!

Three of us got the meal combo for 4 and it was plenty of food! We had slight issues with the grill turning off during middle of cooking but the servers were attentive and fixed it right away. Overall, it was a great experience with good food.  P.S. if you check in on Yelp, you can get a free macaroon ice-cream sandwich.",

I would definitely get the sweet corn cheese to eat with meats.   The banchan selection was alright but I might be biased since SD has so many kbbq places with different banchan selection.   The service was average. It wasn't that busy but we had to flag down the waiters if we wanted a refill on drinks or a grill change. We felt very rushed to order.

    "text": "This spot was recommended by some of my best friends, so we decided to have lunch here. This is definitely not the best in town in regards to meat quality for korean bbq. The meat platters are very small and the combos are not very good. The side dishes (banchan) lack quality and quantity, and most of what they offer are bland or lack much authentic korean flavors.   The prime beef kalbi was alright at best and the pork belly was super skinny in its cut. The pork belly was cut like the chadol, which to me was not worth getting. The pork toro (equivalent to jowl) was quite tough and seemed to be not too fresh. definitely cut different from other places we have been to and enjoyed. The food was not very good, but it was not terrible. But, for the price, I would definitely recommend going to 8oz korean bbq steakhouse, goong korean bbq, hobak korean bbq, or even magal korean bbq. I definitely prefer those spots for quality service and quality food (plus, they cook everything for you as a service courtesy). The service here does not encompass the servers cooking for the table. Overall, I think the experience was very lackluster.   From the start of the meal, we had some issues with the table, and the servers had to move us to another table because of oil and water dripping from the fan system above that contaminated my beer, garnishments, and rice. It kind of took my appetite away completely.   I will say though, the customer service here is quite good. Everyone is very attentive and the manager, Patrick, definitely seems to care about the consumer experience. Eric and Dylan were super attentive, friendly, and considerate. I appreciate your customer service recovery standards gangnam. The service was a 5 star experience for sure, but because yelp is a cumulative for me on the complete experience for dining, I have to be honest and give you guys 3 stars in totality.",

    "text": "I had never tried Asian bbq up to this point in my life. I had researched the ones around town and settled in trying this one. First, I called to make a reservation. They only take reservations for parties over 8 people. So we hoped for the best as I heard it gets busy at night.   Saturday night we get in around 530 and it's already pretty packed but there was a table available. Unsure of what to expect, we took a gander at the menu and agreed upon the Las Vegas for 2 because it was a smaller option, it had chicken and it seemed like a lot of food still.   All the sides were brought out and arranged all over the table. Nothing was explained to us nor did they feel the need to at least tell us what we may eating. So before I asked, I began sampling. Some stuff I knew right off what it was, others I wasn't quite sure and I couldn't quite figure it out. I finally asked and found out I had eaten fish cake! I thought it was tofu or something, I don't typically like seafood and although I'd eat no more after knowing, I can't say it was bad. So then they brought out our miso soup and rice. I loved the soup! Next we got our meats and some veggies and wantons(I could have devoured a dozen of those).  I felt the whole situation was rather unsanitary but we tried to be as careful as possible and not cross contaminate....I'm happy to say, three days later that I did not get sick. The spicy chicken was my favorites of the meats, followed by the beef toro. I liked the dipping sauces, but again no explanation of what they were and they were in a black dish...kinda hard to tell what it is. Finally, we checked in on yelp and received the complimentary macaron ice cream sandwiches, yum! We got green tea and mango.   All in all, the food was good but I felt like we wasted so much. I would have probably given 5 stars but as I said, nothing was explained AT ALL. For those of us new to this kind of dining, it would have been nice.",

The location was convenient, and the food was worthy of a review.  This location could work on: better customer experience as far as employee friendliness goes. We felt that our waiter was A little on the curt side with us, and was not going out of his way to make sure we were having a nice experience at the restaurant. Granted, everyone is allowed to have a bad day now and then. We just felt that it would've made the experience that much better.   As far as price goes, the price point of most menu items were fair. We would have liked to see a greater variety of side dishes available, and we would have liked a more regular refill on them.  What this restaurant does well: Quality and taste the food is good, the atmosphere is rather charming, and the wait time was not too long. Parking is fairly easy and available, and the menu is big enough to give variety.",

The calamari was great, the sweet corn, everything was great, too many things to mention. I wish we had a place like this in My hometown. Everything we tried was on point, my honey doesn't like the fact that we had to cook our things but I don't mind it all. He was so thankful that I found this place that he didn't mind the cooking at the end of lunch lol. Also, yelp perk! we got free ice cream macaroon .

    "text": "Coming in you're greeted by the delicious aromatic smell of Korean BBQ. We went in for a late lunch on a Saturday, so they weren't packed, by service was quick, very friendly, and helpful. Kristin was fantastic! We actually had two different servers ask for our drink orders within a minute of sitting down and they were both very patient while we perused their extensive menu.  They play a mix of pop hits from both the United States and Korea, and the music isn't too loud so you can still have a good conversation over the sizzling grill. They also have a TV over the bar for sports. Their tables come with the built-in grill with ample table space for dishes and elbows.   The food can be a little pricey if you want a lot, but the combos are easily enough for two meals. We got the Meat Lover combo for two and even after eating to our heart's (and stomach's) content, we still have plenty for dinner. It comes with many different meats (pork belly, spicy pork, bulgogi, garlic flank, filet, and brisket) along with other side dishes (rice, miso soup, seaweed salad, green salad, chili dumplings) and complimentary Korean starter dishes. For two meals for two people, it was not a bad price. Since you can grill it yourself to your liking, you can easily share even if your party has different preferences.  The bulgogi is to die for! It's extremely tender and bursting with flavor. The garlic flank was also very well marinated an flavorful. The spicy pork isn't too spicy, so even if you have a low tolerance for spiciness (I can barely stand medium salsa) you can still try it out. They also provide three different sauces for you to add to your food if you'd like but the food was so good as it was we didn't even touch the sauces. The pork belly and brisket doesn't come marinated so if you want it to have a little more flavor, I would suggest cooking a marinated meat (like bulgogi or garlic flank) then use the same area to cook the pork or brisket and you get a bit of the carryover.",

    "text": "Don't pay attention to the bad reviews. I suggest you go and take advantage of their happy hour/lunch specials; they have great quality meat. The interior is very clean, roomy, and low-lit (great place for a romantic meal). The tables are clean and it seems like they take real good care of the grills as well.  I have never heard of this restaurant since they opened and oh my god... I am so glad now that I have! First of all, as a student, I think the location is great! It is literally across the street from UNLV. On my first visit here (also my first time in an asian bbq style restaurant), I was quite confused with their menu, but my server, a lovely Filipino young lady, was very helpful. She took her time explaining the different combos that they offered. I ended up getting the Meat Lover combo, which came out looking very fresh. What I loved most is that it came with miso soup, a salad, a bowl of sticky rice, and 3 different sauces for my meat. On my second visit, I had the same Filipino server. It was also during their happy hour, so select dishes were up to 50% off. I had the Meat Lover again (I can't help it--I love my meat!).  If you are into asian bbq and are near the area, I would highly recommend trying out Gangnam.",

My recommendation would be to get the meat lover :D",

We got all the marinated beef, bulgogi, beef tongue, two marinated chicken, the pre-cooked mixed mushroom. You cook everything yourself. Marinated beef were the highlight; juicy and flavored well. The other things were unmemorable and the mushroom had no salt or flavor. Sides were average for a Korean bbq place. They had good looking but average tasting macaroon ice cream sandwiches (Read: macaroons are at least several days old) that they gave away for free if you check in on yelp.   Our server was friendly. However, no one came to change the grill even once during our meal which is a turnoff.",

I'm from NYC and really enjoyed cooking the food myself vs other places that do it for you. The grill was changed 3 times and everyone was very attentive. The drinks are on the low end - beers are $5-7 and mojotos and mixed drinks are $8. Gangnam special ($68 for 2 people) is one amazing deal - highlight being bulgogi! Next time we come back to LV, we will certainly check it out",

Gangnam is off the strip but located walking distance from the hard rock. Happy hour offerings were only ok, most deals only had a $0.50 discount.   Expect a wait, especially on weekends and at night. We showed up at 9:00 PM and were not seated till 10. There is essentially no room / area to wait so best of luck there.   However once being sat the food was really good! The kobe beef was amazing. The beef toro and pork belly were tremendous though. Personally, save the $23 on the kobe and just order a ton of $5 meats. The quality is amazing. Overall a really great, affordable, Korean bbq place in las Vegas!",

The BBQ is not bad either, I always order Beef Tongue and Duck Breast. The sides are pretty good, love the daikon and jalepeno, and Mac salad.  They are quick with service but very very attentive. I think the whole team here is amazing, everyone does their job really well even though it looks hectic or busy.

Definitely a place to check out :)",

It's located in a shopping plaza next to a tattoo parlor. -They have a nice selection of combos and tapas.  We went w/ the Gangnam combo which in the end was too much food (and I hate wasting food, but didnt want to walk around with a backpack smelling of KBBQ).  I think the bill came out to around $75 including the tip.  Overall, its a nice restaurant with nice servers and you definitely will be full :)",

Service was friendly and grilling your food was fun. I ordered some spicy beef soup which I've had much better in Baltimore. The stock lacked the strong beef flavor which is signature to this soup. Other than that, I will recommend this place.",

The complementary side dishes were alright; fish cakes, bean sprouts, shredded squid, kimchi, and some other things.   The service was surprisingly really good. Got there and they sat us right down. We never had to call our waitress because they were always checking on us. I never had to ask for a refill. Once we were done, they gave us our check and we are out in a minute after that. Super fast service. I love it   Overall, I really like this place. It's worth your money going here rather than those all you can eat places",

However, in those places they end up cooking the food for you, whereas here you're left to do your own thing. The miso soup was by far the best miso soup either my husband or I had ever had. The meat selections were good, but we were left craving some other cuts we've had at other places. Not their fault, maybe ours for not knowing. Would recommend this place to others, but the one down side is that their exhaust fans aren't as strong, so you'll leave with the smell.",

We ordered the \"Gangnam\" BBQ package for two for $65.00, which came w/ five different cuts of marinated beef (i.e., filet mignon, Kobe, etc.) with the following accompaniment:    two bowls of white rice, one big bowl of spring-mixed salad w/ light vinaigrette dressing, four pieces of quartered sweet corn (raw; to be cooked on the Korean table-top grill), mushroom medley, fresh slivers of garlic, and jalapeno slices, SIX Korean side dishes (i.e., Kimchi, spicy pickled cucumber, macaroni salad, spicy pickled bean sprouts, etc.), and two bowls of miso soup.  All of the aforementioned accompaniment were flavorful, fresh, and DELICIOUS. :D   The price was stupendous for all of the foods that came with the package, not to the mention the 10% discount we received for showing my UNLV student ID (GO REBELS!). Albeit, the amount of food seemed superfluous, but there is always the to-go box for the next day.",

My group of 5 came in at about 10pm and were seated in about 10 minutes just in time for happy hour! We were excited to eat after a whole few days of traveling on sandwiches and road trip food.. We came hungry! I can't exactly tell you what we ordered after enjoying several bottles of happy hour soju.. but our bill was very, very affordable for a group of 5. So, I highly suggest happy hour if you can. I also recommend the flavored soju. :)",

FOOD ===== LUNCH FOR 2 - GANGNAM COMBO - $65 Yes, that's a lot of food and pricey for 2 people at lunch (in East LV, more or less).  MEATS Favorite was the prime kalbi - everything else was tough.

RATING: 3/5  SERVICE ======= Felt somewhat rushed at times. Never refilled any of our banchan. The guy kept coming back and forth after we told him  that we were hanging out for a bit and pacing ourselves. There was no line, no people waiting, I didn't understand the rush. RATING: 3/5  OVERALL ========= Does not hold a candle to LA's KBBQ joints. #sorrynotsorry CANNOT BELIEVE how many people gave this place 5 stars.   NOT RECOMMEND, if you're that drunk, eat pho instead. Cheaper and better.",

    "text": "Wow...like wow...  We were treated to dinner here by a colleague during a recent convention...and wow...  Before we had gotten there, they had already ordered...some type of premium platter that feeds ~6 people...it could have fed 6 villages...  I am not sure if this is all in the platter, but this is what we had...  Salads that were, despite us not wanting to waste any stomach space on salad, we're surprisingly light, well dressed and well balanced--a very nice starter.  8 different kinds of Pan Chan...sprouts, fish cake, delicious cabbage Kim chee, perfectly crunchy cucumber Kim chee, and more..  Hawaiian Poke style ahi tuna--this was good, but there was too much other great stuff  Half shell oysters...probably the only imperfect part of the meal...not much flavor from the oysters or the toppings..  Beer  Kobe beef Carpaccio was a great way to open the main portion of the meal and was probably one of my favorites of all great things we ate  Kobe Style Beef that melts in your mouth like butter...to die for...the best part of the meal  Kal Bi perfectly marinated and as tasty as any Korean BBQ I have had  Beer  Filet mignon cubes...so tender!  Flank steak thinly sliced and delicious..  Beer  Scallops and Shrimp freshly prepared  Ice cream macaroons for dessert...strawberry, coffee, green tea, mango, maybe a few more, but by then, I was so far into food coma heaven, it didn't really matter.  There may have been some other things, but at this point, you either get what I am saying or not...one or two more dishes isn't going to make a difference :-P  Even living in the Bay Area with all the great Korean food, I would be hard-pressed to find a place to top this one...  A resounding 5 stars and I can't wait to go back!  VERY Happy Eating!",

It's really cute and clean inside you can't really tell driving by. I ordered the kabocha tempura and bulgogi bibimbap both were really tasty. The tempura was crispy and not greasy the sauce was flavorful. The bibimbap had a good amount of meat and a lot of flavor. I will dine in and try the barbecue next time I'm in town.",

At almost $7, they serve you 5 dead fucking shrimp that's not fresh at all.   $7 can get you a pound of good shrimp!!!!  \"How the f they get 2280+ average 4 stars review then?\"  they offer free desert if you write an review!",

The last couple visits I've notice some Korean food spots open up...being an army brat and having an aunt who is from Seoul...(we're talking growing up seeing clay pots of veggies go underground to ferment) I have a pretty set idea of what Korean food should taste like. This place has it down! When I tried the bulgogi my eyes lit up! It's saltier than Kalbi as it should be (some places make it super sweet, albeit delicious - it's not the way I remember it)  Fish cake on point, Kalbi just sweet enough and all pieces of meat were very tender and high quality.",

    "text": "We ordered Gangnam set. The chicken is really juicy and tender, but other items are actually too sweet that you hardly taste the meat and get sick of the sweetness really quickly. The soup and hot tea are not hot at all. Portion size is ample and can easily be for double the amount of guests they recomend. Among all the staff, only one of them is attentive and friendly. We ordered the honey toast which we waited for over 15 minutes and thought it would never be served. We also got the free deep fried banana for making this rate. I believe this is how they got all the reviews and good ratings because you have to show them the rate to get the free dessert! In conclusion, Gangnam is an up coming trendy restaurant with modern/urban feeling if that is what you are into, but as far as Korean food, I would rather spend my money at many other great selections around the city.",

    "text": "My bestfriend and I came to this BBQ place after we've gone to a Korean Spa. We thought it would be good bec. of how good the reviews seem to be... however, just like most Yelp Reviews... it was all hype. (I'm starting to think that the reviews are mostly fake).   First off, the host told us that we had about 35-45 min. of wait. So, my bestfriend and I decided we could wait for it. An hour passed, after checking in with the host, he now tells us that reservations come in first, before we get to sit. Since we've already waited for so long... my bestfriend didn't want to leave. So we waited another hour, for a total of TWO HOURS!   When we were finally sat on our table, we thought, Finally!!! Guess what? We had to wait an extra 30 min for a waiter/waitress to take our order and we weren't even in a hidden area!!! The person who were in line  five people after us even got their food first!!!   So I finally asked the host for help and he took our order and checked up on us. I don't know who our designated waiter/waitress was but there was this girl waitress who was giving us an attitude, slamming the lettuce order we've ordered on the table. We were just too hungry and to even bother paying attention to her.   The food was just like any other BBQ place. You cook your own food. As usual, they didn't marinate the shrimp and squid long enough for the flavor to cling when barbequed. The food wasn't worth the inconveniece.   I understand the long wait in line to be seated. I also would have understood if it would take a few minutes for food to get ready. However, it is absolutely not understandable when the waiter/waitress would ignore you completely; taking 30 minutes to take your order... when you were sat first. Then, needing to flag someone to take your order.  I actually felt bad for the host because he took our orders and was acting like our waiter... when that's really not his job to do. So we decided to give him the tip. (HOWEVER, upon giving him the tip he said he was actually the manager). Thus, I felt irritated all the way home.  As the manager it was his responsibility to ensure that guests are all attended to. I will never go back to this place again and I will advise other family members, group of friends, other government co-workers to completely skip this one. It's not worth the wait. Not worth the trouble. Food places are meant to be fun, relaxing, not troublesome.",

All the sides that came with it were amazing and we had no idea what some of them were. It was our first time at Korean BBQ and it was great. I also got the peach martini as well as the Apple cooler, both were so good and dangerous because you can't taste the alcohol. The one thing I wish the server would have done is explain the process a bit, as I said it was our first time so I wasn't sure how the meat needed to be cooked and etc. also didn't know what the sides were. I saw so many delicious looking things coming out of the kitchen to guests next to us and wish I would've gotten a bit deeper into the menu. However, the host told us when we come back he would order for us, which we are extremely excited about! We will be back.",

The beef toro usually tastes tough, I am mainly a kalbi guy 3. Shrimp was plump 4. Sauces are offered but not sure what is what, one is spicy two of them taste tangy 5. Macaron ice cream by brick, check in to get one on the house   Service 1. Adequate but could be better  2. You get help from all the staff 3. Happy hour from 3-6 and 10 to close last call 12ish (double check times) for reduced price select dishes and beer/sake  Ambiance 1. Clean and slightly dim 2. Ample parking 3. CC accepted  MoJo 1. The bibimbap bulgogi is yum, also does cream cheese wontons and toppeuki (delish)",

However, I'm docking a star because the servers didn't explain anything to us. I'm guessing they assumed we knew what to do? Other places I've tried like this would tell you how long to grill each meat for, what type of sauces were given and such but not here. Either way, we still enjoyed our meal. I'd definitely eat here again if we're in town.   Oh, maybe skip on the spicy pork.",

I waited max 10 minutes without a reservation. The service is amazing. Any time I finished a plate 20 seconds later the plate was cleared from the table. The wait staff are extremely attentive yet not overbearing. NOW let's talk about the good. Everything and I mean everything was amazing. I 100% recommend the cream cheese wontons and the meat lovers meal. The pork belly is tender. The filet in unreal and practically melts in your mouth because of all the marbling. Plus the cost for value is unheard of in Vegas. I will be making this a must visit/ staple every time I come back to Las Vegas.",

The staff were attentive and refilled our waters, and they were very understanding when we got our bill but wanted to order more food. Overall it was a great value for the money we paid. We also used the check-in to get one free macaron ice cream sandwich which was delicious and refreshing! If i were from the area I would come here more often.",

    "text": "Awesome KBBQ restaurant.  My group ordered the Gangnam special and it was one of the best meals I've had in Vegas.  It came with a salad, miso soup, raw oysters, bibimibap, corn and a selection of protein.  I have a big appetite and I was satisfied with the amount of food we had.  The meats were good quality and it's up to you to ensure they're not burnt.  We basically threw on plate after plate of meat.  You finished what you had on your plate and there's more in the grill!    I called ahead since we had a group of 12.  They have a large room in the back and were very accommodating.  Service was good.  Definitely would come back to this restaurant.",

However that attention was hard to come by and many staff appeared distracted by the Olympics. We ordered the premium for four, which was certainly enough food for five people. The beef carpacio was stand out, and some of the meats for the grill were excellent, but it seemed like the quality of some of the marinated meats was a bit low, and careful chewing was required. The flavor, overall, was excellent, and for what we got, the price was very reasonable. Would recommend.",

We found the correct location in a strip mall next to a tattoo shop. The service was quick and attentive. Three or four servers regularly checking up on us and refilling drinks and ban chan dishes.  The decor is very modern (typical Vegas style) and comfortable. The food was fantastic! We ordered the Gang Nam set for 2. The meat selection and quality was very good. There was enough food for at least three people.  Value was fair. I thought the price point for the quality and quantity was a very good deal. To top things off, if you check in on Yelp, you get a free macaron. We were a party of five, two people checked in but they gave us five macarons, three on the house.  Would definitely recommend this place.",

    "text": "We were in Vegas for our annual family vacation and almost at the end of our stay so everyone is pretty much Buffeted-out.  We turn to Yelp for suggestions and Gangnam Asian Bbq came up. Now mind you.. I'm not much of a fan of having to cook my food when I go out to eat but I'm game. I like to just stuff my face with dinner I ordered and the only effort I want to put in is to slice and lift-to-mouth but again, I'll go with the flow.  The place is in a small strip mall so parking was good. We get there and there was already a line. Personally, it seems small.. I look at the \"Maximum Occupancy\" and it states 75. Remember, I'm still hung-over from the buffets where you see hundreds of people so I had to remind myself that 75 is a good size restaurant. There's a bar in the back of the restaurant where I saw a couple seat themselves because they didn't want to wait the 30mins for a table. While waiting, there's a constant stream of people coming in. This place must be good then.. but we have to wait for our table to see.  We get seated after about 30mins as stated and get a table where the grill looks totally brand new (or got one heck of a cleaning).  Around it are the condiments where we got 2 of each.. kimchi, pickled bean sprouts, baby cucumbers, radish, squid??, fish cake.. you have to pardon me but I don't know what they were called so I listed them as I saw them. We ordered pork belly (lots of it), Beef Toro, and Korean Prime Kalbi. The kids (they're actually adults now but they will always be my kids)  proceed to grill with earnest and the meats cooked fairly quick. Each one of us were given dipping sauces (3) to dip the meats and they turned out very tasty. Again, I'm not a fan of having to cook my food before eating it, but since I wasn't cooking.. it turned out well. Perhaps if my pockets were deeper, we would have swung for the Kobe beef also or more marinated meats, but what we quite full and satisfied from what we ordered.  Overall experience was great.. but why 4 stars and not 5? The service was good but not great. We had to ask to refill our waters and had to flag them down for other requests. It wasn't too much of an effort and the restaurant was very busy but the servers didn't come around often enough to check. The food was good but I had to cook it and season it myself so I can't say great.  The final bill came out and for a party of 6.. it was very good! A lot of food for the price and everyone seems very satisfied. And for the experience of non-buffet.. this was a win.",

    "text": "Sometimes a simple service can affect an overall dining experience...This is the case of this restaurant.  Came in for lunch, the restaurant was about 70% full. A male server seated us, not a hi, welcome or any greeting.  Plates, water, and utensils was sliding on the table. Needed the flag down the staff to order when they were pretty much..Staring blankly and standing around.    We finished the first round of the side dishes and flagged down a shxt face service for second round, he asked \"which one\" I said \"all of them\" he stood there for about 5 seconds silent then left without clearing out the empty plates then came back \"sliding\" the side dishes on our table...  Seriously, the food quality is just ok. You would expect it to be better when 6-8 thin slices of beef portion like appetizer that would cost $9+ per plate....",

    "text": "This place is not on the strip. It's about a 6 minute drive and hidden in the corner next to the foot spa. I'm an out of towner from Dallas, Tx and we have our fair share of Korean barbecue places. But this place has a meat selection very different from the ones back home. They have Kobe meat (super soft and melts in your mouth), scallops, and even duck breast. The meat here is so much more succulent, flavorful, and different from the regular short ribs and brisket.    My boyfriend and I got the premium meats and it was really worth it! It comes with appetizers like the tuna poke, oysters, miso soup, and beef carpaccio. The oysters were good but left a weird aftertaste. The beef carpaccio was a little on the sour side and the tuna poke was super fresh. This deal also comes with the  best cut meats in the restaurant. The table will be full of your regular Korean BBQ sides like kimchi, bean sprouts, and fish cake. When they bring the meats, it may seem like a small portion but it's actually really filling for 2 people. I really appreciate that their presentation of the meats are sliced and placed carefully on decorated plates as opposed to the meats back home are slapped onto a dingy plate and cut in front of you with scissors.   The only thing I don't like is that they don't give you advice on how to cook the meats like the Kobe beef. Service here is quick and polite. We were seated within 2 minutes and food came out in 10 minutes.",

For main dishes, I was able to order garlic shrimp, and my friend also ordered things like bulgogi and duck breast. I do wish rice came with the meal, looks to me you have to order it separately.

Place is decorated nicely and makes for a great atmosphere. Husband and I decided on the Gagnam Special for Two. We were originally looking for an all you can eat Korean BBQ restaurant; however all the sheer amount of reviews for this place caught our attention and it happens to be a few doors down from one of our favorite sneaker boutiques. The food was good, high quality of meat with pretty good sides (kimchi being my favorite) and you get a LOT of it for what you pay for. I'm taking away a star for service. Our server was quick to drop off our bill when we weren't even halfway through the meal (we hadn't asked for it yet) but not quick to check on us..didn't do so once the entire time. Felt incredibly rushed as it was starting to become busy and you could tell they just wanted as many people in and out as fast as possible. I would come back during a less busy time. Left so much food on the table.",

They didn't even take out the name of whoever does not show up but keep waiting for that person to come. That is not how customer service work. You will lose more business it is how you decide to run it that way. The worst thing is to let customers who have been waited for a long time to see someone shows up, and claim that its their turn to be seated. It doesn't matter how good your food is, but if the customer has bad experience even before he or she can taste the food the business already fail.",

Firstly, kbbq is acceptable in 100 degree+ weather because it's kbbq and it's necessary. Secondly, come during happy hour! They have spicy pork, bulgogi, and pork belly for super cheap! I recommend all those three as well as the japchae. It's delicious. My dad had the bibimbap and loved it as well.  The service is great too, they were very friendly and attentive.

It's well off the strip, and consequently lacks the pretension of many of the more central eateries, which was very welcome.  We picked from then menu rather than going for one of their set menus, but everything was delicious. The meats were all tasty, well-seasoned and mouthwatering. The cheese fondue was surprisingly good for its simplicity and worked better than we expected. The Bibimbap was also tasty, although the presence of my children meant I had to choose a less spicy option than I would normally.  The Korean side dishes were great, although the refills of Kimchi we asked for never materialised. In fact, the slightly chaotic and inattentive service was the only thing that prevents me giving the place the full five.",

The host at the front counter was really apologetic, but we were not bothered at all. We did walk  in after all. We went with the a la carte items as there were some items in the set menus that we weren't really interested in. Portions for the a la carte items were a bit small, but it wasn't a huge issue for us as it gave us a chance to try more of the different dishes.  Our favorite meats were the pork belly and beef toro. Actually ended up getting multiple orders of each. Spicy tofu soup was also good with a nice spicy kick.  As for the service, everyone was really friendly and our water was consistently filled. Food came out at a constant pace.  Overall, I would recommend this kbbq joint if you want a break from all the burger and steak joints on the Vegas strip.",

Both were absolutely fantastic paired with their house soju. The banchan, unlike other Korean restaurants, is plentiful and the server explains what each one is.   I'd recommend the dumplings in chili oil, the Japanese peppers and the mushrooms (dip them in the ponzu sauce).  The servers here all appear to be Korean-American which helps with communication. Don't get me wrong, I love an authentic kbbq but ahjummahs are not always known for their friendly customer service.  Even the rice is on point! They offer brown rice for the health conscious but order white rice because it's exceptional.  They have Brick macaron ice cream sandwiches at the front as well as if you needed any more reasons to come here.",

Most of the pickled items seemed a little dry, and the overall selection/variety of the banchan was mediocre. I guess I'm used to Korea, where the side dishes are as important as part of the meal. I was also not impressed with the chicken karaage which they used chicken breast for (made it dry).",

The food took a while to come out even though the servers said it was coming out right now. The Kobe beef was good, but the rest was average. The servers weren't very nice, but they weren't particularly rude either. They did give us two miso soups on the house though, which was nice of them.",

    "text": "Portions VERY small and wait is long even during off hours.  Meat is okay, the same hot-water dough that becomes cream puffs and eclairs -- and the straight cylinders therefore have a lighter texture than their potato-based counterparts. These were classic iterations; lightly herbed, they had been gently browned on one side for a contrast to their pillowy interiors, and served with crunchy celery root, velvety sauteed black-trumpet mushrooms, soft and earthy goat cheese and a silken garlic cream for a very successful dish.",

    "text": "I was wondering why this restaurant has over 3000+ reviews. Turns out they offer a free macaron ice cream sandwich if you write one. What a brilliant marketing scheme! Every restaurant should implement this Yelp hack. Food-wise their dishes were quite good and varied, independent of the free dessert offering. Came out very fast and efficiently. The uni bib bim bap was quite delicious, but be sure to specify that you do not want them to mix it. Unfortunately they mixed mine before I had a chance to protest but were nice enough to bring me extra uni on the side to compensate.",
