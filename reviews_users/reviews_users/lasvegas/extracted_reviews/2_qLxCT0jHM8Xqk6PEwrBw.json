The location is off the beaten track a bit but well worth a try with over 50 beers!",

    "text": "I have been going the Slater's 50/50 in Huntington Beach since I can remember. I liked that they had unique burgers like the PB& Jealousy... but I loved their option to build and name your own burger. Being the picky person that I am, it's great to be able to customize something just the way you like it. They were also one of the first burger joints I had been to that offered gluten-free buns. The atmosphere of the Huntington Beach location was great, they are in a massive stand-alone building and their bar had its own room (in the middle of the restaurant) and was always packed. The customer service was amazing and the food was literally always perfect. When I heard that Slater's 50/50 was opening in Vegas, I couldn't wait to go and take my BF who had never been to one before. When we arrived I was underwhelmed with space, it was not a stand-alone building and had a completely different vibe from the other locations. When we went to sit down our server did not ask if we've been here before and did not offer the custom menu, I had to ask and almost didn't because I had assumed they didn't offer it here. When I asked about a few menu items on the custom menu that weren't there like they used to be she had a lack-luster response without a resolve. I know you carry these items, is it extra? Is there anything you can do? My BF ordered a triple Wagu build your own and I built up a chicken burger. When the burgers arrived, his Wagu was only a double. We wanted to say something but say for so long before anyone came by he just decided to eat it. When he bit in, it was well done (like the burgers you get at a friends BBQ that were purchased in bulk. It was tough and super dry.  We waited for a little longer and said forget it shes not coming back. Halfway into the burger she finally checks in and we share the problem with her. He explains that he didn't want to wait as he was on a fast. She again lack-luster responded without a solution. I understand he ate half of the burger, but to actually be sorry is one thing vs shrugging it off like oh well. Same goes for the fact he ordered a triple and got a double. My chicken burger came on a gluten-free bun, the bun was not toasted and was literally cold in the center as if it wasn't even warmed. The chicken was room temp and the pineapple was cold. Biting into a cold chicken burger is never fun when you're expecting a hot burger. The fries were cold as well, most of which were undercooked and still hard in the center but soggy on the outside, it was a strange experience. When we got the bill we were surprised to pay $65 for two terrible burgers and a shake. The Wagu (they have a 24 karat burger that is gold dusted bun and bacon with truffle cheese). When we asked about the bill it was a candid response but it was the first time she actually cared to bend down and seemed to want to help us. We did have to push to speak with a manager about the experience. Thankfully he had some resolve to the situation but was short and frankly rude about it. The entire staff was messing around right behind our heads in the kitchen the entire time and were making fun of each other, customers and telling people to put their phones away. Although the manager did apologize and attempted to make things right with a discount, that's not what we wanted. A True and honest we will make sure this never happens again or asking how they could make it right with genuineness is all we wanted. The right staff can make or break a restaurant or franchise, and unfortunately, because of this experience, I don't ever see us coming back.",

I'm a waitress myself and was beyond impressed in how much she knew about the menu for the to have just opened. I will be back and I will request her! Oh the bacon beer cheese fries are a MUST!

Our first time there was about 2 weeks ago. The restaurant was maybe a quarter full, we were sat rather quickly but that was the extent of it. The waitress was slow to take orders and was very inattentive throughout. The staff in general was very disconnected from the customers. The only redeeming factor from the experience was the sweet potato fries. We figured it was the exception for the atmosphere, not the rule. So we decided to go back and try again tonight.  We arrived a little after 2100 hours. The restaurant was not busy and the hostess was nowhere to be found. The bartender, standing 10 feet away completely ignored us, as well as the kitchen staff and a waitress. We waited a few minutes to see if anyone would address us, and no one did, so we walked out. We won't be returning.",

In fact, I have already returned for round #2 with my family. I had the  same FANTASTIC waitress \"Chloe\" both times. WOW, she'll get you excited about eating and trying new items. First time there, I shared a plate with my friend and it just wan't enough. The second time I got my own plate and damn, that was a whole lot of food! The Modelo draft helped wash it down though. LOL. Thursday night football was on, so we had entertainment. Also started talking with neighbor customers and had a great time.  Slaters is just a down to earth fun place with lots of creative foods and good people. I tried the BBB Burger first and this time the Lone Star Smoke burger. Also, sweet potato fries with pumpkin sauce. Fantastic!  The best damn bacon burger and the loaded chili-cheese fries were AMAZING !!  More Modelo!  Ha-Ha. Love this place!!",

The bacon Mac and Cheese balls are a MUST get, sooo good! Their bacon Bloody Mary was also very tasty, you could definitely taste the alcohol. The burgers were great, my husband loved the wings and beer also. The only reason I didn't hit 5 starts we're the kids meals. The kids pizza is not really pizza and tastes more like a spaghetti or ravioli, not bad but definitely not a pizza. And the kids chicken fingers could use something different, maybe it was time to change the oil? Overall very happy and we will be back again.",

Ordered my youngest their \"pizza\" which is not pizza it came like a pita bread with sauce on top, very disappointing.  Our server was Alex, he was good at first, but as time went on, he declined. Took long to get refills, forgot to bring us more napkins as I requested, I had to ask for my check, never asked how everything was etc.  Slater's was a check box for my family and I we don't see us returning.",

Alex also suggested we upgrade to the bison patty.  Skeptical, we opted for one of each and had them cut in half.  Both were out of this world, but the Bison was a tad better.  Fries were great, slatherings were great (ordered on the side for fear of making my fries soggy) all in all it was a-lot of food for 2 people.  If you're unsure what to get, I would opt for the hi brow burger with the upgrade to the bison Patty.  For beverages I had some brand of porter I had never heard of.  I sampled the nitro peanut butter porter and it was very good.  Opted for an entire pint of it.  I wish I could've had another but I had to catch a flight back to Detroit. If we come back to Vegas soon we will be sure to hit this establishment again.  Kudos to my wife for finding it as we were driving to the airport.",

It looked like a great place and had good reviews, so off I went. I cannot remember the bartenders name, but she had to be in the top three of super nice, helpful and fun people I've met in recent times. She recommended a burger which I got, it had bleu cheese on it, and they knocked it out of the park. Served with delicious french fries and a side of their bacon catsup. Could not finish it as the portion was huge, but had I had more time to stay I would definitely have hung out and had a few cold ones.",

When I received my Burger, the over easy eggs was already popped. I'm guessing the Burger had been ready for awhile because neither the bun nor patty were hot. The yolk had dripped out and was soaked up by the spongey bun. The bun was so wet from the yolk and the sauce in the burger, the bun fell apart. When I called the server over and asked for a new bottom bun, he said, \" the bun is all soaked with the yolk, right? He knew what the problem was and served it to me like that anyway? And then he was visibly annoyed with me. Also, the fries were nothing special. They tasted like fries from Wendy's.",

I was brought here by a few friends who had tried the place beforehand. We were seated immediately. This was after olympia weekend so I needed the extra calories for recovery. Monta ramen wasnt enough so I came for the burgers an hour later LOL.  Service was friendly. Water was refilled at a very reasonable rate. No complaints and their witty banter was very appreciated. Ups here.  As for our orders. The dip... the vampire dip... amazeballs. Creamy, aromatic, heavy, wonderful. Not much to say.  The burger, however, wasnt as expected. Dont get me wrong, I loved it. It's just that the 50/50 patty had a texture that made it more like a pulled pork sandwich, so as a burger fiend, I wasnt 100% satisfied, but as a guy who came out doing an ass ton of reps it was dope.  Will eat again. Very curious about the all beef patty!!!!",

We almost turned around and left.  We decided to stay, and ordered the chips and dip for an appetizer, I ordered the bison and bacon and he ordered the best dam bacon cheeseburger. Service was friendly and fast. The food was not what it was hyped up to be. The cheese sauce in the chips and dip tasted like nacho cheese out of a can with beer added. My bison burger was pretty good I liked the bacon jalapeno jam. The best dam bacon cheeseburger was mediocre. It wasn't special in anyway and we were not impressed.   This is fine for lunch or dinner with the kids or something but it felt more like a bacon themed chachkies then a \"hot and new romantic restaurant\".",

    "text": "Think I just a not so good experience. 1st if you don't like spicy don't come here. Every thing is spicy! Who heard of spicy spagettii? Or Spicy Cobb salad? Didn't have a burger, which is their main menu item, next to all draft beer. But I would make sure they don't have spicy sauce etc on the burger.  Had to wait 15 minutes, before being approach by our server, probably because she is the bartender too, and probably why she was a blur running back and forth.  Still the food is fresh and we'll made. The manager approached the table without us asking to see how we are doing. When I let him know I wasn't expecting a spicy Cobb salad, he immediately offered to replace it. I didn't accept, because I didn't have an appetite, but the offer was sincere. So maybe just more bad luck on our 1st trip, we'll see.",

Was a real treat and pleasure I must say and I highly recommend Slaters based on my visit. Burger was great as advertised. Very nice atmosphere to get some afternoon computer work done.

It doesn't mean they didn't try to modify, which I so so appreciate! But I would really love if they designated a cool version for the ones not privy to the meat.    I loved all the creative menu options, my boyfriend is a meat connoisseur and I always like going to all restaurants to share experiences, regardless of if I eat meat or not.  The restaurant is new so I'll chop up the ac being out of whack and the forgotten drinks to new territory, I give this place a 4/5 and I'll defiantly be back when I figure out how to modify even more lol, the picture is the alarm burger with, you guessed! No cheese, no bacon spread, no egg or brioche bun LOL!  Don't eat the pumpkin dip that comes with the fires of you are vegan, there's mayonnaise in it, however if you are like my man, try not to lick the little cup it comes in clean... table manners lol (just kidding, he's a proper gentleman but he says it's to die for).",

I ordered the b, b, b which is 50/50 bacon burger, bacon cheese, bacon strips, and a fried egg . It is pronounced buh buh buh because it is so much bacon it makes you stutter.  They have bacon salt on the table too.   The meal comes with choice of sides. I had the regular fries.  They were served with bacon ketchup.  Honestly they underwhelmed me.  The ketchup had a slight smokey flavor and the fries were ok but not spectacular.  The sweet potato fries looked much better. The burger however more than made up for it.   At the bar they have at least 50 beers on tap with a descriptive menu. Now, back to my diet",

It's a little greasy, but it is a burger and it does have a bacon base.  The fries are basic. Nothing too special there, but nice complement to the burger. I suppose the bacon ketchup would be the appeal!  The layout and space in there is cool. Very open. There's tons of different beers, which is awesome. They also let you sample before you fully order, which I always appreciate (it's so annoying ordering a full size drink and not being into it).   I haven't tried their desserts yet, but man, their milkshakes look so appealing! Will definitely be back.",

The Tapatio ranch was awesome and Bacon Ketchup tasted great . Our burger was cooked  perfectly with a beef and bacon patty . The Bun was incredible and complimented the burger perfectly. The onion rings were very crispy and was incredible with the ranch sauce .   I would recommend this to anyone that loves burgers and bar food . I am looking forward to going back and trying more of the Apps and Beers they have on Tap .   I do wish that the seating was a little more comfy and the hostess should not be wearing the shorts she was. The corporate trainer was there and was very nice . Our waiter was a very nice guy and did a fantastic job covering the menu and what Slater's was known for .",

I had the pork a palooza and while it looks like it isnt enough for one person it is more than enough. Everything was cooked just right and delicious especially the pork belly and bacon. We had garlic fries to share with the table. If you love garlic then you'll love these fries. There were 2 cloves hidden inside and its soft to eat. I love garlic and it was just right amount. My friend had the chili sliders which she devoured. Its a bit hard to pick up and eat because they give you a generous amount of chili. She ate it with a fork but it was still delicious.   Customer service was great. They were attentive and had our water cups always filled. Overall great experience.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner with some friends after a long day of volunteering. Slater's is a place that was popular in SoCal and I had a location bookmarked for the longest time (I don't remember who told me about it or where I had seen it). Recently heard that it opened up in Vegas.   Slater's 50/50 is located on the SouthEast corner of Bermuda and Silverado Ranch, adjacent to the supermarket. We had came here on a Saturday evening, around probably 8 o clock. The restaurant itself looked pretty busy with the bar on the right, and the dining room spread to the left. Received a pager and said a party of 4 would take 15 minutes. Surprising that it was such a short wait and also surprisingly it was fairly accurate. We were seated within this time frame.   Slater's is popular due to their burger patties made with 50% beef 50% bacon. Never had a burger with a blend of meat like that so I was quite excited to try. BEFORE YOU ALL BURN ME LATER, IM GOING TO SAY THIS. I'M NOT A LOVER OF BACON OR BURGERS . . . !  There was a dip that I've heard of before that sounds amazing. \"Slater's Vampire Dip\" is a dip made with roasted garlic and artichoke hearts blended w/ creamy melted cheese, served in a sourdough bread bowl w/ crispy pita and veggies for dipping.   OH.. MY... GOD ! THIS .. WINS ! Garlic and artichoke dip already sounds amazing enough. To my surprise, even their sourdough bread bowl was FRESH and HOT ! EVERYTHING WAS SO GOOD ! Pita bread was \"crispy\" and was a good \"start\" to eating the dip. Carrots and celery seemed mildly weird to me to dip with. The bread bowl was the best part. I LOVE a good sourdough bread and THIS WAS GOOD ! My friend and I kept digging and ripping out the bread bowl because it was so yummy ! It was so good, and he ate so much, he had heartburn all night long (rip him). LOL HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ! ! !   3 of my friends had all ordered the original 50/50. I had ordered the Hi-Brow burger to be \"different\" but it also sounded really good.   \"The Hi-Brow Burger\" consists of a Black Canyon Angus beef patty w/ melted swiss and blue cheese, baby arugula, caramelized onions, horseradish, bacon-jalapeno jam and roasted garlic aioli on a brioche bun with A1 on the side.   Aside from the blue cheese, everything else sounded amazing. I opt'ed to leave the blue cheese in there to see if I would like it now but NOPE LOL DEFINITELY STILL DONT LIKE BLUE CHEESE HAHAHA !   I opt'ed to have the patty switched for their \"50/50\" burger patty to try but had soon later regretted it.   Burgers come with a choice of \"French Fries + Slater's Bacon Ketchup,\" \"Sweet Potato Fries + Pumpkin Sauce,\" or \"Slater's salad\". You can also \"Slaterize\" your Fries or Burger. For the fries, you can add \"House-Made Beer Cheese\", \"Slater's Shmanimal\", or \"Bacon Chili Cheese\". For the burger, you can make it a \"Double Patty\" or \"Triple patty\".   I opt'ed to have my French fries \"Shmanimal\". They described it similar to like \"In & Out's\" animal style with grilled onions, beer cheese, and bacon.   For the fries, its like the \"premium\" version of animal style. Onions are nicely caramelized and cooked. Beer cheese was nice. Overall, it was pretty decent. Could kind of omit some of the bacon   The burger, was a bit weird. The patty itself, was a bit firmer than I had expected. Probably because of the bacon, also it was much saltier than I had liked as well. Friend had said, i should have stuck with the black canyon angus beef patty instead ! Aside from that, the blue cheese was really strong. When I had ordered, I had expected like a mild amount of blue cheese with a moderate amount of swiss... man I had forgotten there was swiss in this ! LOL ! Loved the arugula, caramelized onions, horseradish, jalapeno jam. OH ! the roasted garlic aioli on the soft but chewy brioche bun was good !   Overall, eh. tried everything we wanted to try. Wouldn't really come back again for the burger. Vampire dip and a beer? maybe.",

We didn't have one thing that we didn't like. Also, I love having meatless options that are tasty. Its in a great location, not far from my house.  The only reason this place didn't get 5 stars was because our server wasn't kind or friendly. I could tell he was not having a good day and his lousy attitude kinda cast a little cloud over our meal. He didn't seem to want to serve us. Idk why, we are friendly people.  I'll try going again some other time...",

We were seated and offered regular menus, lunch menus, and the happy hour menu that started 15 minutes from the time we sat.   We opted for lunch specials. The Slater's 50/50 burger and the fried chicken cobb. I had a bite of the burger and it was really good. The salad was a huge portion and very fresh and filling. We also added fries and a coke. The burger was tasty and all of the flavors went well together. The fries were piping hot and we sprinkled some of the bacon salt on them and they went with the bacon ketchup well.   I saw a few more items I would like to try and would definitely stop in for happy hour for drinks and appetizer specials.   The manager was stopping by each table to check in on the diners which is always a nice touch. He made sure everyone liked their food and that they weren't waiting long.   The area needed a good and unique restaurant like Slater's 50/50. If you haven't tried it yet then definitely stop by. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "When the building and door read: Bacon, Burgers, and Beer it's going to be an uplifting experience!   Here we stand with the door opening to an establishment that I have been meaning to eat at for weeks. It is always the places that you put off that turn out to be ridiculously outstanding.   As I walked into the business I hear Run DMC playing, alright so let's find a seat at the bar. As you pass through the threshold on either side are bar taps from every beer one can possibly think of. Yes this is going to be a wonderful afternoon. With the clock reading around three-ish, I fell in with the lunch special dash. The specials they run are on some popular drinks on the menu. Deciding that a Bloody Mary with bacon is always delicious it's what I started with. To chase that however it was good old fashioned Coke!   Now that drinks are here it's time for food we ordered the backyard burger and added bacon to it.  On their lunch special one can take advantage of any two appetizers that are listed for $8.00! We figured why not. We sampled the tots and queso cheese and fries with bacon ketchup. The burger entrees have the option of tots, fries, or salad; I took the green salad option.   As we waited for the order to come out of the kitchen the music that they play is hip and fun feeling to sing along with. The music is a mix of everything; from Zeppelin to those Reggie classics that just make you wiggle! The service from the staff here is beyond amazing. The burger did not take to long to put together either. With my Bloody Mary only half gone, and the burger and tots show up what fast and delicious service. The smells coming from this backyard burger are intoxicating. It's time to sample it, enough smells!  Giving into temptation I cut the burger in half since it's easier to enjoy. Who does not love a good burger? Let image for just a moment the smells of the backyard bbq that we had all had, the fun of running in the backyard while dad cooks those burgers. The aroma of those smells tantalize my senses and take me back to those times that were oh so long ago! The burgers here are inspirational since the taste takes me back to a time that love filled my life. I'm not sure how they replicated that backyard burger taste, but it's the memories that remind somewhere of a time in their life that brought them such sheer joy. Wow I wonder what some of the other burgers will inspire.   The service was just as wonderful as the food. The bartender was our server and drink maker. Actually the bartender tended to all of our needs. The restaurant was steady, not really busy. This amazing and lovely lady was able to handle a couple of tables as well as her bar customers. She made small talk with the customers that sat at the bar too! The skills that the staff here are amazing. I noticed the other server that was tending to the customers in the main dining area was just as nice. What really stuck out with the other male server was his manners? He used the proper sir names for the social niceties we all observe! He was very genuine and gentle too! As he passed our table and interacting with the bartender the fluidity they shared was positive and mellow. I love a crew that works well together it makes being a customers so fantastic. Knowing that the service is way above the standards it would make me recommend this place to oh so many. It's the staff that are the True representation of a business, and the management is very professional at what type of individuals they want to be serving their guests. Thanks to the wonderful staff here for all their hard work and effort that they continue put forth.  Now who wants to go back in time and remember those bbqing memories of when dad was grilling and you and your siblings were chasing the dog around the yard. You were just wishing dad would cook those burgers faster since the smells are driving you nuts. The backyard burger will send your senses on an exquisite and exciting journey of discovery. You will be remembering when and be able to rediscover those times again, and it's all because your taste buds associated those smells and tastes with such happy memories. The Bloody Marys here are amazing and the bacon slices in it perfection in a cup. Need to watch that game come and do it here the beer types and varieties are ridiculous. The staff is genuine and professional with such stellar service. It's almost Sunday so now you know where to go and watch the game, and bring the family they are all welcome here! The beer is on tap and cold, so come on and join in on the fun!",

My glass of water tasted like beer. Dirty straw probably not. Dirty glass probably not beer spilled in the ice probably so. Kind of a disgusting thing to begin the night with. Burger, with wagyu beef, medium well. Problem is I ordered medium rare. I ate it anyways. My wife's Burger cold. How I don't know. I had a chili burger she had a chili burger her chili was literally cool to the touch. Are regular waiter who was quite busy at the time stopped to help us get a warm Burger. Hey at least I don't have microwaves to heat them up then LOL We want this place to succeed. It's close to us and they have a good theme. I guess burgers were coming back all day but the cook. I hope he's okay. Maybe just having a bad day. The fact that both of our meals and my water we're all out of whack is really crazy. I only tipped 11%. I told the waitress / bartender that it was due to our experience. She said she couldn't help how they cooked the burger. I showed her the burger and asked what she thought it was and she said medium well. Then she got the ticket and showed me she ordered it medium-rare. I guess she forgot about the beer water. LOL Anyhow, like I said, I hope this place stays around but I'm going to give it some time before I return.",

Ordered the frickles (fried pickles), vampire dip, and split the PB and Jellousy burger. The frickles were good, served with a honey mustard dip that really brought out the bitterness in the dill. Not necessarily a bad thing! The vampire dip is a super cheesy affair with artichoke in it, served in a sourdough bowl with carrots, celery, and pita wedges. AWESOME and highly recommended! The burger was delicious and reminded me of my first experience of a peanut butter burger in New Orleans. You might think \"ewww\" but you'd be oh so wrong. The flavor combinations of the patty, PB, jelly and think cut bacon go so well together. As a note, the regular fries that came with it were overdone.  This place also has a HUGE selection of beer, the usual suspects along with some great local choices. They offer flight samples so you can try a few without the whole problem of looking like an alcoholic with the 6 pint glasses on your table.  I definitely recommend this place!",

I ordered my burger medium, and it was almost raw. I should've sent it back, but I hoped that the bacon and sauce would cover it up. The French fries and bacon ketchup were good, not mind blowing either. My husband had the hot dog, and he actually liked his, but he tried my burger and agreed it was not worth going back for.",

My wife got the Lone Star Smoke, including onion rings, which she said was very good. I had the spaghetti with bacon meatballs which was also very good. They have an excellent selection of craft beers, as well as old standards, on draft. A little something for everyone. I'm curious to try the Mac and cheese bar. Our tab was around $40, with my wife's burger, my spaghetti and a beer each. Our server, The Todd, was very knowledgeable regarding the menu items and checked back with us several times to see if we needed anything. In summary, Slater's 50/50 is a nice addition to the neighborhood and we hope to see them do well.",

We were taken care of by Melissa and Freddie. Both very attentative. They were pretty busy once we sat down so we couldn't get immediate service, but they were communicative and still acknowledged us which is all we needed.  I could tell Freddie was slightly new only because Melissa was assisting him a few times, making her a great trainer. But Freddie has got all the right basic service down ez, he'll be great if not already.   Ordered the porkapalooza platter which was basically bacon in multiple ways. Was not A fan of the vinegar pork grinds as I like them crispy , will ask for it without the vinegar next time if I do order it again.  Ahi Tuna nachos were bomb, super fresh tuna. Needed more sauciness though.  And the peanut butter jelly burger was tasty. Its always nice to have an array of flavor notes in one bite.   I like the music selection, TVs, brightness and chill vibe. Definitely want to come here to watch vgk games.   The highlight of my dinner was instagramming my experience and getting IMMEDIATE love shown back. That's some above and beyond service... taking Care of the social media end right in the middle of a busy dinner shift.   Love the beers on tap, but they definitely gotta get Training Day from Reavos's 7five Brewing if they are a True vgk establishment!  I live like 5 minutes away so I'll def come back.",

Oh, I also got it a la mode    If you're a frequent beer drinker, they have a monthly membership for $30 that gets you one beer a day everyday. Worth it in my opinion.

They also have killer sweet potato fries with a pumpkin dipping sauce that takes the fries to a whole other level. If you choose regular fries they also have a solid bacon ketchup dipping sauce. The staff is friendly and there are enough TVs to enjoy whatever sports your into. I know they have a bar but to be honest I'm there for the food.",

My whole mood changed as we were seated though. Just by looking and reading some of the sarcasm on the menu made me laugh. I wish I took more pictures, but believe me you can't go wrong ordering anything from this place. But definitely come hungry! Our party ordered 2 appetizers, including this huge pita dip which was amazingly cheesy with that nice crispiness from a quick fry. I was already filling up from just that. (Of course it doesn't help that I have a small gut either) I ended up getting a classic all beef burger and of course sprinkled some bacon salt. There's still a lot on the menu that I wanted to try like their nachos. Hopefully next time!",

It was so good that I wanted to keep eating it even though I was so full. Now something you need to know about me, I don't normally order hamburgers because of a)calorie overload & b)I just don't really like hamburgers. So kudos to Slater's 50/50 for doing a great job. However the fries were tasty but not hot. Our server was nice enough to get me some new ones but they weren't much hotter. My daughter had the chicken lettuce wraps and they were good as well.  The staff is very nice and they were incredibly busy because there was a charity event going on and I know that they were short handed, and our food came out sooner than expected and our server was lovely. The restaurant was clean and comfortable. We will be happy to go back many times",

    "text": "Fantastic beer, and excellent food!    A few weeks ago, I went to Slater's 50/50 for the very first time.  I decided to come here because they have the impossible burger, and as a person who does not eat meat, this is a big deal for me for a restaurant to have plant-based protein option in their menu.  They did not disappoint.  Our experience was stellar from start to finish.  Our server, Lisa was terrific, and she made great beer recommendations for my husband and me.   Here is what we ordered:  Sweet Potato Fries with Pumpkin dipping sauce - TO DIE FOR!  You've got to try this dish, and add this to your order if you do come and dine here.  Impossible Burger over salad with Avo; it was delicious! You can have the Impossible burger however you like it.  I just opted for the salad option.   Ahi Tuna Poki Nachos - my husband's favorite dish now.   I ordered a flight of beers, and they were all great!  I recommend that you try the Dragon's Milk - it is delicious!  We also visited Slater's 50/50 in our area when we returned home from Vegas, and although the food and drinks were great, the Las Vegas location was WAY better.  LV Slater's 50/50 had great vibes, great staff members, and overall a great dining experience for my husband and me.",

    "text": "Slater's 50/50 is one of my favorite burger restaurants in the world, and I frequent several of the locations in Southern California. The new Las Vegas branch is an absolute disaster. It's located near \"my side of town\" but I won't be returning for many months. Here's hoping they get the kinks worked out soon.   Everything about the space feels cheap. It's in a rundown shopping center in a not so great part of town. The location alone will likely prove to be the restaurant's downfall. The concrete floors look like they ran out of money and couldn't finish them (they're stained in the restrooms but not in the main dining area, for instance). The tables are ugly and cheap and look like something out of a small town diner. For a sports bar atmosphere, the televisions are plentiful but they are so tiny that I'd never want to come here to watch a game -- I'm not a fan of squinting. They're also stingy with napkins.   The menu is extremely limited, and they don't even have Slater's signature \"Create Your Own\" burger menu. We asked twice and the answer we got was \"we don't want to overwhelm the kitchen but we will have them soon.\" Not a good sign. The prices are still just as high as the other locations; expect to pay $15 - $20 for a burger with a small side of fries.   We ordered our favorite menu item, the crispy brussels sprouts. The presentation was sloppy and careless, and the sprouts weren't crispy. Neither was the bacon. They were grossly oversauced; so much so that even my sauce-loving hubby commented that even he thought there was just too much slopped on top.    Since we couldn't create our own burgers, we both settled for the BBQ burger. These burgers were absolutely disasters. First, the server didn't even ask us how we wanted our meat prepared (guess well done is their only option?). Second, our meals were loaded with way too much sauce, to the point where I had to get up and take napkins off the adjacent table to try to wipe away the BBQ sauce on top. It was DROWNING in a sickly sweet sauce. The bacon on the burger was absolutely disgusting. It was limp and undercooked, and had a fake smoky flavor. The side of sweet potato fries were delicious, but it's hard not to make great fries.   The service was abysmal too. It was friendly enough but hardly welcoming, and they were very slow all around.   I hate to write this review but this Slater's is not good. Why bother expanding into Nevada if you're going to do such a bad job as this? You guys need to do better.",

    "text": "Worth a cheat day! This was our first visit to (any) Slater's 50/50 and it was gooood! We started with the vampire dip (roasted garlic, artichoke, cheese) served in a bread bowl with pita and carrots, as well as the frickles (fried pickles). We devoured both and literally had to stop ourselves from eating to save room for our burgers. The vampire dip wasn't too garlicky and the pickles were fried perfectly. Home run on both appetizers!  I had the Backyard Classic (basically a burger with cheese, onion, lettuce, tomato) but subbed out the beef for the \"impossible\" veggie patty. I had my doubts but it was actually really good! About as close to the real deal as you can get, from plants. My only criticism is it's a tad dry, so if you're used to eating juicy meaty burgers, this probably isn't for you. But as a healthier alternative, I would definitely order it again! It's a $5 upcharge but worth it, IMO. The burger came with bacon ketchup, which was delish!  Service was also good and although it was pretty busy, we didn't wait too long to be seated or for our food.   Overall I'm glad they don't list the calorie count on their menu because my experience would be dampened, lol. We will definitely be back (on my next cheat day ).",

    "text": "The good: lot of options and variety to the menu accessible to carnivores and vegans alike. You can tell a lot of thought goes into their offerings and the concept of incorporating bacon into everything. On the meat sampler thing (they had a fancy term for this pictured in review) has a pork chicken wing that was delicious. If I could just eat a plate of those I'd be happy.   The restaurant was well decorated and the staff was friendly, though the waiter was really pushy on the peanut butter burger. He also trie to talk my friend out of ordering the sloppy joe sliders which was awkward.  The ok: the food. Everything on the menu made sense conceptually, but once it all came together it just fell shot of what I expected. A great example of that was the 50/50 original burger. The patty was cooked well but the beef/pork ratio made the patty a texture I thought was sub optimal for a burger. The other problem this burger had was the chipotle mayo was really bland. Couple that with the egg not having a way to stick to the bun and the whole burger was a sloppy mess. Near impossible to eat without 10 napkins. The prices also were ok. I've spent more on a gourmet burger, but I've spent less on better burgers.  The price point shouldn't deter you from going nor will it be a reason to go.   The bad: So many components that I was expecting to deliver serious flavor fell short. The chipotle mayo was weak, guacamole (on my burger) unseasoned, the chicharrones were really bland, the bacon popcorn soggy, and the onion rings (on my friend's burgers) were not good. I think I just had a higher expectation for some of the items and was let down.   Some good and bad here. Our group of 6 agreed we would come back if invited, but we wouldn't go out of our way to go here on the regular and we probably wouldn't tell a bunch of people to go out of their way to try it. As one friend put it, \"If you gentrified Red Robin you'd get Slater's.\"",

    "text": "If epic meal time ever had a burger place this would definitely be it. If you love bacon this place is definitely for you. From bacon salt to bacon burger patties you can find all sorts of interesting combinations here. After helping a friend move we knew a greasy burger and some brews was in need but not sure if i'd be back for the burgers.  Setting: In an other wise pretty life-less plaza that's more known for the seafood market, this place definitely adds some well needed attention. The interior is well spaced out and very inviting. You can see the kitchen from the dining area and not hidden behind closed doors. They have a large chalkboard with their beers on tap unfortunately if you're facing the entrance you'll have to turn around to see it.  Original 50/50 Burger: They're known for their 50/50 burger patties which are half bacon and half ground beef. Personally I wasn't a big fan of it, its just too salty for my liking. I got their original 50/50 because it has all my favorite things in a burger: fried egg, avocado spread, and mayo. The burger was alright.. patty felt warm than hot, and bun was too thick.  Peanut Butter and Jellousy: My friend is a very adventurous eater and really wanted to try this. It honestly tastes exactly how it is. Its a bacon burger with peanut butter and jelly in it BUT the optional scoop of vanilla ice cream takes this burger that bogs you down and really brings you back up. Surprisingly good with the ice cream   Fries:  I think it's like $2 you can add beer cheese, their version of animal style in n out fries, and I forgot the third option. Being a huge in n out devotee I got that option and immediately regretted it. The cheese look like it was sneezed on my fries and didn't even cover most of my fries.  Drinks: They have a HH and a good selection of beers. I personally the lost coast tangerine wheat, tasted like orange cream soda!  Overall: I think its a pretty cool, comfortable place to grab a couple beers and maybe share an appetizer. Their burgers are unique but not crave able.",

    "text": "Slater's 50/50! They are known for their half beef and half bacon patties. I've never tried their other locations so I definitely wanted to try their Vegas once since I live here. Yay to no traveling!   They are located in a giant plaza with a supermarket and other restaurants. We got there at around 8 pm and the wait was not long at all -- we only waited for maybe 15 minutes?   We started by sharing their Vampire dip, which is like an artichoke dip but with a ton of garlic. It came in a sour dough bread bowl with pita bread on the side as well as some celery and carrots. The dip was absolutely delicious and can possibly be a meal in itself if you don't share. The bread was fresh. It had great flavor and the cheesy goodness definitely satisfy any cravings you may have. I would not hesitate to come back just for this dish.  For my entree, I decided to go with the \"Original 50/50\". It had their famous 50/50 patty with a sunny side up egg and avocado. It came with your choice of regular fries or sweet potato fries. I decided to go with regular fries but Slater's had other ideas. They decided to give me BOTH type of fries! But that was only because they had given me the sweet potato fries instead of my regular ones so the waitress gave us the regular fries on the side.   The burger itself, for me, left me unsatisfied. I was not a huge fan of their famous blend nor the flavors. All I could really taste was the bacon part of the patty because it completely overcame the beef flavor entirely. On top of that, the texture of the patty was hard to get used to. It was not tender and juicy -- it was thin and firm. I guess the taste of the bacon was so strong that I couldn't really taste anything else but that could just be my own taste buds. I ended up only eating half of the burger.   The winner of the burger entree is definitely their sweet potato fries. It comes with a pumpkin dip that gives you a nice cinnamony boost. I like sweet potatoes but I'm not a huge fan of the fries typically. However, Slater's definitely does a great job on them. They were quite yummy.  Overall, decent place. They have a huge list of beer from you to choose from. I probably won't be back for their burgers but I wouldn't mind coming back for their Vampire dip :)",

He was so lit, he kept asking if we wanted to try the \"vamp dip\" to the point where we HAD to order it since he wouldn't stop suggesting it! Best decision ever made! Because it's bomb! I could not stop ranting to my boyfriend about it and we finally made it to a Slater's location newly open here in LV! Best part about this vamp dip over the years is it hasn't changed one bit! Still as delicious as a I recalled 5 years ago! Nice surprise! (Sometimes restaurants change what's already great and turn a great dish into a good dish...sad fact)   Lettuce cups and Brussels sprouts off of the appetizer menu are tasted also! Go and get it!!!",

    "text": "Updated review: I am truly glad that I gave this place another shot after having a meaningful talk with the owner. Last time I came I made a review and had a nice talk with the owner of the restaurant franchise. The owner was very friendly and asked about some suggestions and any concerns that I may have had. It is very nice to feel heard, even if it's just a food concern and after hearing that there were new menu items I decided I must give this place another try. I came back with my family members and I decided to try out the new items and they did not disappoint. I had the sweet n sour cauliflower, limeade and cheeseburger bowl. Although it looks a little crazy the bowl was actually very good and added a healthy spin to a regularly known unhealthy food option. The cauliflower was really good and it truly did not seem like I was eating vegetables, which was a huge plus for my table. I still found this restaurant to be extremely affordable, which is always a plus in my book and with great staff as well you can't go wrong deciding to come here for dinner. Our waiter, Alex and the manager we saw, David were touching many tables and I witnessed David go to each table to check on everyone and I truly was thrilled to see a manager take such initiative to get around to the guests. I know before I said it was not my place but I've changed my mind after having such a great experience the second time around. Thank you Slater's 50/50 for a great meal and experience!   My previous review: This was a really good late night burger restaurant. The menu was pretty brief but I did like how it was simple and to the point especially since they specialize in burgers, beer and bacon. I ordered the back house burger, my SO ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and my mother got spaghetti. Pictured below is the receipt for all 3 items which to me wasn't that bad. I am personally not a bacon fan so I don't think this was the best place for me burger wise but if you are I am sure you'd enjoy it.",

    "text": "I could probably copy/paste much of my review from last year. That means they've done a good job expanding their chain.  Slater's 50/50 is a fairly well-known SoCal chain of sports bars that has very recently made the jump to Las Vegas. They opened up on the southeast corner of Silverado Ranch and Bermuda, which is thankfully not that inaccessible for me. I'd already tried their most famous menu item and was looking forward to doing so again when I heard about their publicly advertised grand opening event.  On both Saturday and Sunday, the first 50 people in line on each day were to receive a free Original 50/50 burger ($12.99 usual cost). Unbeknownst to me, a pint of Modelo Especial ($5.00 usual cost) was added to the offer, and this did taste like a fresh Mexican lager should. It's pretty easy to sip and not bitter, but it's not that bold and wouldn't overtake other flavors. Makes me excited to try the rest of their ~48 beers on tap, especially given the affordable $5-8 price range.  Back to the burger though. The 50/50 patty is 50% bacon, from which it gets rich, smoky flavor, and 50% beef. However, I was left wanting more beefy flavor, and more juicy meat too. However, the pepper jack, avocado, chipotle mayo, and fried egg w/ runny yolk added plenty of richness, and the soft brioche bun holds it all together just fine. I liked it overall.  The burger also came with a small side of french fries. They weren't so crispy on the first day, perhaps due to the rush/pressure on the kitchen. Thankfully, they got the exterior right the next time, although they did end up being heavy-handed on the salt. The bacon ketchup was good on both occasions, so I just hope to see a little more consistency on the fries.  We also picked up some extra appetizers and sides to try. We did the \"Double-Down\" ($10) to get one portion of House-Made Frickles and one portion of Crispy Onion Rings. Both were surprisingly great. The frickles had a crispy batter and weren't too tart inside, and they went well with the honey mustard. The onion rings were insanely crunchy and worked with the BBQ sauce or alone.  Only one of day two's apps was worthwhile. The Bacon Mac and Cheese Balls ($7.99) are crispy outside and fall apart so quickly, and it pairs well with the Tapatio ranch dipping sauce. The Chips + Dip ($5.99) were plain and came with boring queso and strangely runny salsa. The Tots ($5.00) were average at best, so stick to the Frickles and Onion Rings for your extra sides.  Service was better on the first visit despite the larger crowd. Our server today was all over the place for some reason. Thankfully, we did receive additional napkins before having to ask on each day. Those burgers got messy with yolk running all over.  I'll definitely be back to Slater's 50/50 for the food and the beer, especially when I need a sports bar. It's not top tier from a pure burger standpoint, but the complete package has plenty to offer. Looking forward to trying the non-50/50 burgers (including the non-meat \"Impossible Burger\") as well as the other starters and entrees!  (UPDATE: Can't remember exactly when I came back to try this, but the Peanut Butter & Jealousy burger is pretty dang good. Try flipping it upside-down for the second bite to see how that layering hits your taste buds.)",

We had a baby and toddler, and they were very accommodating to set a baby seat for us before we sat down.  Excellent service ! We had quite a list of orders & our server didn't even write it down. She memorized every detail, impressive !  Lots of parking in the plaza which is such a big win!   Now, the amazing foooood! We ordered the original 50/50, best damn bacon cheeseburger, pork-a-palooza, and Slater's vampire dip. Omrrrrgaaat, I give it a 12/10! Everything was cooked to perfection and so delicious! Highly recommend the vampire dip!   They have a large selection of craft beers to complement the bombbbb food!   Definitely going back when I'm in Vegas, MUST swing by if you're heading to Vegas or back to SoCal",

It was a special day because they were doing a Burger Eating competition (wish I could have been in it ha) but we just stood and watched the contestants eat while we waited for our table to open up. The hostess also was very courteous & concise.  So to summarize the service it was wonderful.   The food was just the same I got the burger with peanut butter and jelly on it and it was insanely delicious! My date got the 50/50 original which I also took bites off and it was tasty in its own way all together. My burger I got the wagyu beef because that's my favorite but I look forward to eating a whole burger with the 50/50 beef bacon skater Pattie",

I had the \"Love, Slater\" brewed specifically for this store and it was amazing! Paired nicely with the Sriracha Burger I had. My friend had the the High Brow burger and Aaron suggested that the Belching Burger pairs well with his food. My friend really enjoyed it. Aaron knows the menu really well! He also made sure he tended us without feeling overbearing.   I really enjoyed my experience here. Wide selection of craft beers and food options. They have a checklist menu where you can make your own burger plate (patty size, additional meats, sauces and upgrading your fries).

We tried them out tonight (apparently their first night open) for dinner. We ordered a Lone Star Smoke Burger and an OG Impossible (vegetarian) Burger. They also obligingly served us just the chicharron from their Pork-A-Palooza starter.  The Lone Star was good, but the OG Impossible was a little overdone and slightly dry-ish. Also, we wish we would've been given the option to have the Lone Star Smoke Burger medium rare. Not sure if how you want your burger cooked is an optional thing or not here, we were not asked.  Despite a minor snafu with cheese, overall I would give them another chance. Their burgers aren't cheap, but their menu is interesting and we'd like to try some of their other offerings.",

    "text": "Not bad at all! On Slater's week anniversary of being open, I would consider the place a success!   We went in and found the inside busy. There is outdoor seating, but it was 108 degrees so everyone was inside. We were quickly given a table. The booths in the middle aren't anchored down so my seat was shifted several times by other patrons. It was mildly annoying, hopefully they fix that.  Gabriella was quick to take our order and was very helpful in negotiating the menu. We decide to try the Original 50/50. The burger was a small 1/3 pounder (I'll get an extra patty next time, it's an option). This thing was a tectonic mess! The egg lubricates the top bun, the avocado lubricates the bottom bun. Things were sliding every which way! The pork/beef blend is a little sweeter than straight beef. It was very tasty! With the toppings on the 50/50, flavors came together nicely! The fried had a good flavor, but were a little soggy and limp. The bacon ketchup helped save some of that mess.   All told, I was very happy with the meal. I am really looking forward to getting back and trying the Sriracha burger!",

    "text": "To sum it all up, once and done.   This wasn't a place I wanted to go, but relationships are about compromise and the bf had been asking to eat here for a while now. So, I caved and there I was looking at a menu. I would have felt better saving the calories for an In-N-Out burger.   I opted for the Original 50/50 burger. The patty was half beef half bacon. The rest of the burger had jack cheese, avocado, sunny side up egg and chipotle mayo on a brioche bun. It was just too rich of a burger for my liking. There was no acid in the burger to break up the richness. I had to ask my bf for his pickled onions from his side salad to break up the taste. And there was no crunch in my burger either so it was like eating mush the whole time. Again, I had to ask my bf for one of his onion rings from his burger to add crunch. Halfway through my burger, I was just over the taste. It was falling apart and super oily. My bf took a bite of it and agreed it was way too rich. He was surprised I even got that far. The only saving grace to my meal was the sweet potato fries. They were fresh and hot and not overly sweet. I did NOT like the pumpkin sauce the fries came with though. It tasted like a dessert sauce. I'm not trying to eat a damn pumpkin pie with my burger.   My bf enjoyed his burger though. He ordered the Lone Star Smoke which came with angus beef, smoked bacon, cheddar, onion rings, pickles and bbq sauce on a brioche bun. His definitely was the better burger. It had texture and crunch. There were different flavors throughout the burger and not just an oily taste like mine.   We also ordered a kids meal for my son. We opted for a cheese pizza with fries. What we got was definitely not worth $7. It was pretty much a tortilla with tomato sauce and melted cheese. It was probably the worst excuse for a pizza I've ever seen. Our server didn't even give us the option for my son's drink, which is included in the price.   It was a nice restaurant. The floors could use a good mop since they were a bit sticky. I don't like how the men's and women's restroom are on opposite sides of the restaurant. Our server had no personality and was just like \"hey, how's it going\" blah blah. It seemed like he was just going through the motions. It was pretty dead for a Saturday afternoon during lunch time. I think because the location is just wrong. Honestly, I don't see them lasting long.   Thank you, next.",

    "text": "Came in on a weekend night with a group. Place was busy. I wanted to really like this place but it fell short. I am bummed about the bad experience because I wanted another joint to go to. We arrived before the sun was setting & by the time it started setting the sun was blinding those of us that were sitting facing the windows. We asked if there were shades that could be pulled on the top set of windows & told they didn't have any shades for the top windows. Even with our sunglasses on we were still being blinded by the sun. Bad preparation for opening a new business & not ordering shades when your business faces (the west) setting sun.   Was informed by some of my group who have dined at Slaters 50/50 in California locations they allow you to customize your own burgers but this Nevada location does not. If this is a chain why wouldn't they have the same options? Also was informed no happy hour in NV but CA does have it.   I ordered th 50/50 buger. Upon arrival I cut it in half to eat & saw it was raw. It had a huge slather of regular mayo on it & not the chipotle mayo as advertised on the menu. I like mayo but not 1/3 cup slathered on the bun. And the egg was fully cooked instead of sunny side up (also menu advertised) so there was no yolk to break & spread over the buger which I was so looking forward to (reason I ordered it.) Another diner in my group also ordered the same buger & theirs was pink but not as pink as mine. I then realized they never asked me how I would like it cooked while the server had asked others. I sent it back to be cooked more. I never got a photo of it raw. When it arrived back the 2nd time there was no egg on it & the outside egdes were burnt. By this time all the rest in my party had completed eating & I hadn't even had a bite. Our server wasn't in sight so one of the diners with my group went to the kitchen to ask for an egg. They brought it out seperately on a plate after about 5 minutes & then someone (presume a manager) came by the table & asked if I wanted them take it all back to the kitchen to put it together. I told them no since it would take even more time & all the rest of the people in my party were just waiting for me to eat. I wasn't impressed by the 2nd burger as it still was pinker than the medium I asked for & had burnt edges. I do not like the taste of something being burnt.   Another in my group who also ordered the 50/50 burger thought theirs was too pink also but they ended up eating all around the edges & when they mentioned the color of their burger to a waitress that came by the waitress stated it's that pink because the burger mix isn't 100% beef & has bacon in the ground blend. Now I grew up on a beef farm & we blended our ground beef with other meats including pork & never had the cooked product that pink when cooking burgers to medium. The burgers are expensive with a tiny amount of fries. For the price of the 50/50 burger at $12.99 plus $0.50 cents for a leaf of lettuce & another $0.50 cents for a slice of tomato I feel there are far better burger joints in town. Most of their bugers were around $15. Another diner ordered the crispy Brussels sprouts & I tried a bite while I was waiting for my food as I was starving) & they were not cooked enough as they were pretty hard. I had actually had crispy Brussels sprouts at a restaurant the night before & they were excellently prepared. They didn't prepare correctly (according to what the menu states) the Sloppy Joe sliders that 2 of the diners in our group ordered & they had to ask about it the preparation. Another diner ordered onion rings instead of fries which I did try the rings & liked them. They weren't greasy like most places. They almost seemed like they were baked.   While they did comp my burger (which I feel is only appropriate considering all the issues on their end & I had to eat after all the rest of my group was done eating) I really don't know if I will give them a 2nd chance. If I do decide to try it again it will be at least a good 6 month so they can work on all the kinks they have.",

My boyfriend has been to a location in California and I've heard nothing but good things about the place. I've worked in the industry for a while and I had great service from Deano the bartender, he had great recommendations because as a woman I'm so indecisive about everything and it was nice to get a second opinion without any hesitation, which is annoying question I know. All I know is I can't wait to heat up my leftovers, I highly recommend the Brussels and the turkey burger, I don't eat red meat but my boyfriend ate every bite of his burger and fries. Can't wait to back again! Thank you!",

Weygu beef...I was so looking forward to this, and so disappointed...it was a BOMB, this beef was FAR OVER COOKED, no temp was asked when ordering. We walked in around 8:30, and oddly enough, the place was EMPTY.   Service was slow for not having any customers except us... The other people at my table were equally, if not more disappointed in the temperature, fineness and taste of their burgers.  They were way over done and did not taste good. We are here for 2019 Vegas Shoot, and heard this place was good, however IT WAS NOT. Slow service, NO COINS IN THE REGISTER, so they rounded up and took 61 cents more than what the bill was originally, WITHOUT LETTING ME KNOW THEY WERE GOING TO DO THAT ROUND UP.  They gave me a dollar more to compensate . The bill was $31.39...they originally brought me $8.00...$0.61 MORE than what the bill was So disappointed in this experience. I do not recommend this place. I'll throw in, I'm a grad of the CIA worked in the business for many years.  I WOULD NEVER HAVE LET ANY OF THAT FOOD OUT OF THE WINDOW.

    "text": "I was hoping this would be a great new spot for family and friends. Unfortunately I won't be going back for their food.  Their beer menu is impressive, I'll give them that. The burgers are a bit on the expensive side. Three burgers and two sodas, we spent nearly $70.  We didn't care for the Burger or fries. Fries were cold and is similar to fries from Wendy's. Burgers were small and kept falling apart. Just wasn't worth what we paid. I really wanted to like this new place because it was close to home.  I would have given them another chance but I was grossed out by their food handling. I wanted to cancel our food after what I saw but still wanted to taste the food.  They have a small open kitchen so you can see everything that goes on. I was watching intensely. I kept thinking of Dirty Dining. They have two cooks. I saw one cook wipe the sweat off of his forehead while he had gloves on and didn't wash his hands or change his gloves. He went right back to cooking. I had my food by then but that was gross.  What I had a big problem with is how they serve their fries. They keep their fries in a bowl and the waiter/waitress/whoever grabs a handful of fries and puts it on the plate next to the Burger. I saw one waiter drop some fries and he picked them back up and tossed them back in the bowl. I saw four different people put their hand in that small bowl.  That's not all. There we're about six burgers ready to be served and apparently they mixed up the burgers because one woman was touching/opening the burgers to see which was which. There were three people there trying to figure out which Burger was which. It was a bit comical.  At that point I told my family we will never eat there again. Just the thought of too many hands touching my food. Yuck!! Especially since the gloves are made to touch food only but they touch everything else too.  They have a very small kitchen and at one point there were 8 people crowded around the food ready to be served. Two men walked in from the back and talked there for a minute or two.  One woman appeared as though she just woke up with her long hair not tied back and noticably unbrushed. She was the one touching the food too. I can imagine her unkept hair easily falling into the food. I only saw one person there wearing a hair net. A smaller woman in the back.  Just the whole hygiene factor has me grossed out.  I'm in healthcare so I pay attention to those details. They were also only wearing one glove. Blue gloves. I wanted to ask if they were the proper gloves for food handling but they should be, right? We use blue gloves in the clinic. That's all I could think about too.  They are fairly new so I'm hoping they get their stuff together. Unfortunately I won't be giving it another try. If you eat there, watch their food handling and hygiene skills.",

The Burgers are not as amazing as their staff and menu describe. The have the appearance and flavor of a pre made patty. The Buns fall apart easily and become soaked in grease and juices from the burger. The portion sizes were manageable....However they are pretty proud of their product($$).          The Employees and Beer selection make this an option if you live in the area and the interior is loaded with Tv's if your trying to catch your favorite sporting event. I wouldn't trek across town to try it however when your in the Silverado Ranch area certainly is an option.",

Food quality was better most than other burger places but not good enough for the prices. I will never pay $20 for a burger in a strip mall.

We ordered:  1)  Pork-a-palooza--Bacon Salt & Vinegar Chicharron, Salted Caramel Bacon Kettle Corn, Sweet & Sour Agave Pork Wings, Crispy Pork Belly with Jalapeno-Bacon Jam, and Slater's Giardiniere.  2)  Bacon mac and cheese balls 3)  Best Damn Bacon Cheeseburger and regular fries 4)  P.B. & JELLOUSY burger--Black Canyon Angus beef, thick-cut bacon, natural peanut butter and strawberry jelly on a honey wheat bun with sweet potato fries and pumpkin sauce.  We also got the dip of vanilla ice cream to go with the burger. 5)  Bacon Chili Crunch burger--Black Canyon Angus beef topped with melted cheddar cheese, Slater's bacon chili and a crunchy layer of potato chips on a brioche bun with lettuce, tomato and red onions. 6)  Ultimate S'more shake--Toasted marshmallow shake, marshmallow fluff and crumbled graham cracker crust, topped with toasted marshmallows, chocolate syrup and a campfire roasted s'more. 7)  The King shake--Peanut butter and roasted banana shake, with peanut butter and bacon crust, topped with caramelized banana, chocolate sprinkles and smoked bacon. 8)  Happy Birthday shake--Funfetti shake, vanilla and Jolly Rancher crust, topped with sprinkles, Twinkies and a cupcake, finished with sparklers.  Slater's 50/50 means that their burgers are half ground beef and half ground bacon burger patties with some strange (different) combinations making up some of the burger choices.  The mac and cheese balls were like I've had before but the pork-a-palooza platter was really good especially the crispy pork belly with jalapeno-bacon jam.  By reading the descriptions, you can see that all the dishes have bacon in them in some way or another.  The only burger that was a bit off-putting for me was the P.B. and Jellousy.  Peanut butter didn't do it for me with it's mixing with jelly and the burger.  All three shakes were very good.  They all had good flavors but my favorite was the s'more shake.  Really good flavors.  Next was the King shake.  Service was excellent.  They moved us two times so that we could be out of the sun.  The restaurant faces east/west and the sun was going down and coming directly into the west facing windows nearly blinding us.  Shades are on order but they are a custom size so it will be a bit.  That will help.  Alex, our server, was top notch.  He answered questions, took our orders, and coursed the meal between the pork-a-palooza and the burgers.  It's an interesting concept and a very tasty one.",

This is definitely not a place to enjoy a quiet, romantic meal, but rather expect a great burger with massive flavor for a great price. The only thing stopping me from rating this place a 5 star is the attention that our server gave to us. I had to get up twice to ask for extra napkins and to refill my water. The server did not follow back up with our order at least once.   Pros: amazing burger wanting me to try the exclusive whale burger; amazing 50/50 patty  Cons: par, bar style service",

I've only tried 5 so far but they've all been amazing.  Great food and incredible service.  The manager even came around to ask how we were doing and to offer any feedback.  Super friendly and recommended downloading the app.  Thank God I did!  A rewards program that you can actually use!   Team all that with the super friendly and personable bartender Kat and you have a winning combo!   Kat is fun, outgoing and super attentive.  I think I just found my new favorite spot!   Thank you.",

    "text": "This place is definitely cute! They have board games as well and beer pong and cornhole! Our waiter was extremely nice(Freddy). As for the food, I totally suggest getting the vampire dip! It's beyond amazing! The maple bacon wings were great too but my wings weren't cooked all the way.As for the entrees, well my order was wrong. We used the sheets on the table to order our burgers but it seemed like the sheets were not identical as it causes some issues with our orders. One sheet will tell you burger sizes are single double and triple patty. The other sheet just has weight of the patties on there. Of course mine had the weight in there and I ended up with a double patty. That didn't really bother me. I was missing the bacon, mushrooms, and beer cheese from my order. Then I was given my missing items and had to add it to my burger in my own. For $26 dollars that was kind of annoying. I was just there to have a good time so there was no need to cause any drama about it. I really enjoyed our waiter and just wanted to leave. My experience was not the best when it came to the food but Freddy was a delight.  Update: Sooo update. We went back and had an absolute BLAST. Our server Tarek was amazing. He didn't realize we were coming back because of our last experience. Once again the vampire dip is a MUST HAVE!!  My burger was made correctly and Tarek even helped me create a delicious combination! Also that Burger with the pineapple and spam?!! That should be there all year! Thank you so much. We are definitely coming back.",

    "text": "I've had Slaters before in Cali but I dont remember loving the burger and now I remember why. It's the 50/50 part.  First of all, the Vampire dip is a 100% must have if you like spinach artichoke or garlic. The bread and pita are a perfect vessel for cheesy goodness. I cannot say enough how much we liked this one.  However, none of us really loved the burger, and it was mainly because of the patty. The 50% beef and 50% bacon idea is a little too salty and doesn't have a pleasant texture. I've simply had much more enjoyable burgers than this. Perhaps I will try the regular patty if I go again but I'm not sure I would because it is on the pricier side for burgers.  I actually enjoyed the sweet potato fries with the pumpkin dipping sauce more than the burger itself. The regular fries came with an odd ketchup that I didn't really like - it was too sweet without the tartness.  All in all our experience was average at best. I can't recommend it over Bachi or Steiner's for a burger, but I could be tempted to go back for some Vampire Dip.",

    "text": "As much as the food was super delicious, I have to share my not to great of customer service in which my group and I received today. Definitely at most *2 STARS FOR THE SERVICE. Our server, Raina, was far from personable, friendly and genuine- slightly shocking because no where during our visit were we rude or showed any dislike to her. First of all, there was no real welcoming smile, and when we told her it was our first time she still showed no enthusiasm, as if she didn't wanna be there. Biggest pet peeve was how long it took for her to deliver my husband's drink from the bar. She said twice how she would check on and deliver his drink, yet we saw it literally sitting on the bar counter for almost 10 minutes. Like seriously?- oh and mind you it was not busy at all, with maybe 3 other tables in the entire place. Next, she made it super awkward when we asked for take out boxes, and when we only used one of the three she had asked if we wanted to keep the other empty ones and had this weird attitude? Idk, it was just super awkward from the get go and she truly ruined what I thought was going to be an almost overall 5 star experience.  If you're someone like me, I'm very keen on the complete experience, it's not just food for me- it's how you make me feel during my visit. Don't get me wrong this wasn't the worst server I've ever encountered but she made it THAT memorable in a bad way that I just have to share.   Moving on to the food...  We tried the following items:  1) Slater's 50/50: 5 Stars. The party is 50% Beef and 50% Bacon! Yes you read that right. The patty is cooked to perfection with a nice medium rare pink center. This was so flavorful with a mixture of textures like an over-easy egg and fresh avocado. I would totally order this again.   2) Nashville hot dry rubbed wings: pricey at $11.99 for 6 wings. Worth it? If your in dyer need to eat wings otherwise spend your paper on a burger.   3) Spicy Artichoke Dip: very, very flavorful but rich and heavy. Would I splurge on this again? No.   Besides the lack of customer service received, the food is pretty good and I won't let the lack of customer service stop my from visiting again.",

Amateur hour. I hope the owners train their staff better than this. After being frustrated with those two, David the manager called me to apologize and offer a replacement. Which was fine but I wish I didn't have to go three people deep to figure that out. The people answering the phone should be trained on how to talk to customers. The salad that I did get was pretty good. Would've been excellent if I had my burrata! Anyway, David called me later on and even offered to deliver a salad himself personally. Which I appreciated. I still think there are some issues but at least he went out of his way to find a solution. That's something.",

    "text": "To be honest the place smelled really bad when we went in. My 14 year old son said \"it smells like most bars\" to which I asked... you've been to a lot of bars? Anyway we say down to eat. My burger I think they called it the best damn cheeseburger had supposed to be caramelized or grilled onions. They weren't very cooked either way. The burger patty itself was really tasty. Best part of the meal for me. My sweet potato fries were cold and instead of the pumpkin sauce they brought me the same bacon ketchup that my son had. When I say cold I mean not any heat to them at all (fries). My son had the 50/50 burger half beef half bacon ground. He liked it. I thought it tasted like bacon fat. Rich and kinda gross to me. And the regular fries were hot but probably frozen and nothing great. The bacon ketchup was lackluster. When he bit into the burger everything slid out of the bun. Egg avocado and patty. He had to reassemble to continue eating. Overall I won't be in any hurry to go back here. Was expecting to get sick from the food which did not happen luckily.  Hot food served hot please.",

    "text": "If you are in the mood for bacon - you will get your fill from Slaters. The place is cool and has so much potential to be a really great sports bar. It has a great beer list that is really solid and a buy one get one free during a game is a good promotion. You just have to double check your bill to make sure they follow through on this. The wings are good. The use of the Hot liquid cheese is good on some items, but on the star items of the menu it is a little disappointing. Onion Rings were also very good and shakes also were very solid.   Service is a bit spotty. The burgers are where this place should be making a big name for themselves and for the money spent - a $10 + burger and not being a bigger burger cooked to medium rare than a In & Out Double Double - which is actually better straight up. I would think that if you are getting a burger that costs this much, the server would ask how would you liked it cooked - when this was not asked - it should have been a heads up that something was a miss. A brioche bun is great, but not having the star of the show being much larger a single patty that compared to Wendys just had to be a mistake. It was tiny. Seriously, this hopefully was a one off experience on the burger side. as the place if they turned up the volume when it comes to big games - has the chance to be a run away hit to watch a game at. Adding thick bacon to a burger that is nearly as thin as the bacon as your lead burger - there has to be some room for improvement. There is too much potential not to fall into the trap of the Planet Hollywood expensive hamburger at what should be a really cool local sports bar just because of bacon being the star of the rest of the menu.    Slaters has so much potential, I hope we were an outlier when it comes to the experience. The menu could be up there with a Culinary Drop Out if it improves and will be a run away hit over other places in Vegas to watch a game.",

I was excited about Vegas finally getting their own Slaters that I raved on and on to my friends and family about it. To keep it short the food was not quality. The buns were soggy, burgers were flat. The cook had the audacity to burn all of our patties and still serve them to us. Even my daughter's sliders were burnt. My shmanimal fries had maybe 5 crumbs of bacon and did not contain the sauce that comes on them. They forgot my gf bacon on her burger too. This location lacks the customization aspect we got at the SD location, the menu has no pictures of their burgers on it and they don't even ask how well you want your patty cooked. I'm sad and disappointed. I hope this location improves so I can enjoy Slater's more than once a year when I go to California. That being said I appreciate the manager addressing us and hope she can find and train better cooks. Any cook who loves what they do will never serve such a disaster to their guests.",

Place surprisingly for lunch was not all that busy and we were seated right away and drink order taken. We ordered water with our drink order and never received the water and beer had a huge head so I lost a few ounces of beer. So I am paying for foam and I here \"the next will be better\"  So that was the first screw up, not by are waitress but the person delivering them. Placed are order for an entree and it came out wrong and warm. \"Not good\" Main course was delivered warm and cold on the same plate. Salad made with wrong dressing, 50/50 burger had no flavor and warm, fries cold. My spaghetti and meatballs had little flavor, tiny meatballs that are warm and overcooked cold spaghetti so I suspect the meatballs are cooked in a microwave. Our waitress was very apologetic and kept saying \"Next Time you come back\"  We eat out quite a lot and I assure you we will not be back even if we are offered a free meal.",

    "text": "Went here for my birthday dinner and I was not disappointed!   Now let me preface this all with I was under the influence of low dose edible marijuana. (It was my birthday and I do what I want.)   I've been to 3 other Slater's locations, so I knew what was up with their food. If you don't know, it's delicious. 50% beef, 50% bacon burger patties is a brilliant idea and has yet to disappoint. Before I went in on that though, we started off with their Vampire bread bowl dip. GOOD GOOGLEY MOOGLEY was this good! You get pita chips to eat with and some veggie sticks to put on the table next to yours as decoration. Order it and thank me later.   I can't speak about the prices because of previously mentioned reasons, but also, it was my birthday and your tab should be picked up by those that are with you on your day. That all said, this is a \"shut up and take my money\" kind of place.  I don't drink, but they did have a pretty incredible beer selection along with some foo foo drinks for those that are into that. (Don't act like you don't know what I mean by foo foo drinks)  Now, everything's been super positive, but I gotta mention a couple awkward things that for me, warranted a start deduction. First, we were sat directly next to people. When our waitress came to see them, she had to really squeeze and she was a pretty fit girl. If I were to have stretched my arms, I could've given the woman next to me a wet willy to her opposite ear. For me, I don't like that. Not when there was other space. Next, there was a weird moment where our waitress came, took our drink orders and got them. But in the short time she was gone, another came and was talking to us. No biggie. Thought she was just given us the Slater's breakdown of what they're all about. Then as she was asking us what we wanted to drink our original waitress came with them. They had a weird interaction and the second waitress all but stormed off. In the state of mind I was in, I thought it as funny, but in recollect, really awkward. Lastly, we almost ate the table next to us's food. (Us's? Lol) they brought us theirs and it was almost our order. Luckily we didn't touch it and it was sorted, but I feel like if we weren't seated so close to someone who clearly had gotten there a few minutes before us, it would've been completely avoided. Those things individually wouldn't have warranted a star deduction, but all together, had to drop it like it's hot.   TL;DR Food good, prices fair, seating situation awkward.",

    "text": "New business in Vegas so I hope the management team sees the review and works through the kinks. The service would benefit greatly from some support staff. Mainly a food runner/busser. A host to greet. And especially having a manager presence on the floor. I came in as a party to 2 on at the end of service on a slow Halloween night. I'm not going to go into great detail being that I've been in the industry for 7 plus years and may be more observant then typical guests. Also it's a burger and bar spot. Nothing crazy. But when the burgers are 15 bucks, off strip, in Henderson it's gotta come through with some quality food.   We each ordered two different 50/50 burgers and fries. Was warned prematurely about how they will come out with some pink in the middle. All goods. Having an open kitchen window means I can see exactly when my burger is up dying in the window. Burgers sat for awhile while the server was in the back making shakes i assume. Greeting other guests and cashing people out. Mind you it was a slow night. So we watch as the burgers sit in the window. Maybe we're waiting on some fries to complete the order? Nah the fries have been done and sitting in a silver bowl. The server eventually throws the fries on with his hands and here comes the food. My burger had an egg that was popped by the knife and lands at the table in a pool of yolk. Oozing chipotle aioli everywhere. Way too much. The avo spread stuff was all over the place as well and was quite bland. Bread was stale and crunchy either because it's old or because the heat lamp killed the food. The fries were so floppy and soft. And the burgers were super pink. Like all pink. My lady couldn't stomach hers so she left hungry. Luckily they took her burger off. I managed to get mine down because I was really hungry. But we ordered them medium. Curious as to why they're so pink? I've had all pork burgers before and they can be cooked up to temp. No one working had an answer as to why they are so pink and soft. All anyone kept saying was it's half pork half beef. But when you cook ground pork it changes color right? Like beef does? The server was not good. The other girl working that came to grab our plates as we left was very nice and apologetic. Obviously is considerably more personable and experienced then our server. Would post as one star if it wasn't for her. I hate doing this but I figured I'd share my experience. We will not be coming back.",

We decided to get the sloppy joe sliders, bacon Mac and cheese balls, and the pork a palooza. The sliders were juicy and the the bread was soft Hawaiian bread. The cheese balls were good but you need to dip the sauce. The pork a palooza was great. The chicharron was the first thing we tried and I told myself next time I go to the Latin market is to get some chicharron lol. The pork wings was good but kinda dry. The bacon  jam and kettle corn was on point. I did not eat the giardiniere because I wanted the bacon lol. I will be back to try one of the burgers but overall the food and service was very good.",

Understandably they were still getting everything in order but everyone from the front desk all the way up to the manager were very helpful and friendly! Our server, Alex, was very knowledgeable and helped make our decisions easy. I tried a PB&J burger with a scoop of ice cream on it and it was so much better than I could have hoped for! The flavors mashed so well together and the fries came with \"bacon ketchup\" which was delicious. I will definitely be back to try more things (or just get that same burger again every time) and to try the milkshakes!",

David the manager was also great, as he made sure every table had their water re-filled and even gave me a sample to try their other non-beer beverages since I told him I didn't care for beer too much. I really enjoyed their watermelon beer but I'm sure there's more I just didn't try! Place was big and clean! They were busy since it just opened but didn't wait more than 15 min as they estimated for our party of 7! Their menu is all about their burgers and brews. I had their Hi-brew burger which was bomb! Their buns were nice and soft, and meat so juicy! Tried their Mac n cheese bites which were crispy and hot inside just the way it should be. The dipping sauce had a perfect spice to it and we asked for more to dip our fries with! One negative I will say is their French fries maybe because they had to make massive amounts to accommodate the people there but a bit on the soggy side and they don't give you much.   We got the s'mores milkshake which was yummy, but a bit runny and not as thick as a milkshake should be! I'm not a bacon on everything fan but if you are, this is the place to eat!   We will definitely have to come back for the awesome ambiance and food! Great for large parties and families! Finally a great burger joint down the street!",

The reason I am giving a 2 star is because I felt straight up ripped off on the chicken wings.  $12 for 6 wings.  Yes you heard me right, SIX wings.  $2 per wing, what a joke.  They were good but not that good.  I will try them again and write an updated review on that experience, but first time around was disappointing which could have been avoided my them being more clear on the item descriptions.  If they told me they were going to only bring me 6 wings I would have ordered something else and probably enjoyed it.",

The ultimate BLT salad was delish, it's enough to share with four people. The bacon salt goes with everything, I bought one to take home. Beer sampling is a fantastic, the manager was super friendly and offered us tons of samples. I am not a beer drinker but it was nice to try ones that were infused with coffee. The ahi poke salad was also delish, but I would rather have it without the crispy rice noodles.",

Our waiter didn't confirm how I wanted mine cooked and the menu said all 50/50 would be cooked throughout- yet both my wife and I had raw meat. Hers was actually cold in the middle. We never saw our waiter again to tell him, not that it would matter. The atmosphere is very loud. With a fooseball table when we walked in I knew I was in trouble. This is a place parents bring their kids so they can drink and let kids run wild, I guess. The screaming and noise was awful.  The Mac and cheese balls were ok. Very dark, little burnt but okay. When I got my bill I just wanted out so paid as fast as I could. Will never be back, even IF the food was good I'd avoid it because of how loud and awful the atmosphere was.",

The 50/50 burger was not as amazing as I had hoped, I pictured a fat juicy bacon flavored burger but the patties are actually very thin and not juicy at all. I would not order it again BUT everything else was amazing. The fries, the sweet potato fries, bacon ketchup, and the ranch dressing (I judge places by how good their ranch is) were all so delicious. I would go back if in the area, I need to try some of the beers next time. They have so many different beers",

I should have really paid attention to the menu, Ingot the \"Original 50/50 \" no avocado or egg, and I ended up with a patty, cheese, and a bun, with chipotle mayo that was VERY bland... not to mention the bun was bigger than the burger, and I guessed it right  1/3rd patty, my bad I thought it would at-least come with lettuce and tomato nah..  But heres the thing, I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, it was MEH, typical delivery spaghetti, but the thing is the meatballs tasted completely different than the burger, like they had a strong smokey flavor to them, as the burger just tasted like a great value frozen patty, I'm convinced the burgers are frozen, and they add liquid smoke to the meatball mixture cause bacon has a smoke profile but not that damn strong.  Lastly, i got the fries bacon chili cheese style... BRUUHHH.  That mess tasted like some canned hot dog sauce topped with some nacho cheese smh   I dunno how this place is rated so high, the food is not good at all, maybe most the folks had a few of the many beers they offer before eating ....",

Plenty of tv screens for any game you wish to watch. No gaming and no smoking, so I'll call that a win. But I stop there. Got the \"crispy\" Brussels sprouts which were not crispy but loaded with oil, sauce and bacon. They were good but a healthy food gone bad. The burger-oh no. Got the 50/50, half beef half bacon, patty. I was concerned it would be overpowered by the bacon but in fact it was hardly noticeable.  The patty was much smaller than the bun, realized in the final bites when I was finished with interior and left with extra bread. Sigh. The burger was a bust. Two of the three words in your \"gimmick\", one would think you would be focused on making the best burger in town. This one will not win any awards.   Want to really blow up your calorie count?  They do have an impressive looking milkshake menu. Saw one come out to a teen at the next table.  I'd love to be 15 again and indulge, but these days I battle the bulge in a daily fight (I win), so it is a pass.   In closing, I will walk here for beer and the game but eat elsewhere.",

    "text": "Originally opened by Scott Slater in Anaheim Hills in 2009, and now occupying 467 East Silverado Ranch Boulevard since July, it was in search of someplace showing the NCAA Tournament that Slater's 50/50 was visited on Sunday, a \"Wake N' Bacon\" Breakfast beginning at 9:00am on Weekends strangely ending at 11:00am but owner Andy graciously agreeing to prepare a couple items thirty minutes late in addition to some of the Lunch & Dinner choices.  Famous for their blend of 50% Beef / 50% Bacon, and now inhabiting three States including their lone Las Vegas franchise, it is between walls of taps that guests enter suite 100 of the Southeast commercial center, a hostess podium straight ahead offering seating at a banquette with full view of at least a dozen televisions plus the bustling kitchen.   Showing sports with the sound off, pop radio overhead loud enough to be heard but not disrupt, it was with greetings from an inked female sever who stated Breakfast ends \"at 10:30\" that Water was poured and menus distributed, her apologies noteworthy as she tried to make the situation better by offering alternatives including some specials.  Disappointed but not dissuaded, miscommunications overcome while Appetizers were being prepared, it was beginning with a stack of Onion Rings and Slater's Bacon-imbued Fried Macaroni and Cheese that light Batter proved noteworthy, a follow-up of Ground Beef and Bacon with Potato Chips added for crunch also enjoyable and certainly better than the average family's \"Sloppy Joe night.\"  Convinced to try the Vampire Dip by two regulars, fears of late-day reflux unfounded as the roasted Heads are nicely tempered by a Cheese blend and pureed Artichokes, it was finishing off all but a quarter of the Bread Bowl that The Slater's 50/50 Hot Dog arrived, the eponymous ingredient here packaged thick and snappy with a Sonora-style wrap plus plenty of Condiments so that diners may dress it as they like.  More impressed by Slater's Fries this time, both classic Spuds and those made from hand-cut Sweet Potatoes crisp and well salted, it was at the request of a friend that Slater's $24 \"24K Burger\" arrived spotlight-ready, a dusting of edible Gold making for fun pictures while the Sandwich itself shines thanks to finely-ground Australian Wagyu that stands up well to truffled Cheese and Bacon while the buttered Brioche Bun maintains its structure admirably in the face of Aioli and Demi-glace.  Waiting a bit longer for Breakfast items, made-to-order Hollandaise with more smoke than heat largely responsible, it was likely an effect of time that saw \"crispy\" Pork Belly a little flaccid atop Buttermilk Biscuits, though Tots in a tangle of Onions and golden-fried Chicken with Two Pancakes, Country Gravy and plenty of Bacon proved well-worth getting up early on a Sunday for.",

The food is ok, it's super rich and the presentation is kinda sloppy. But seriously, the bad service from our server Lisa is hard to look over. I didn't even want to order a beer from her, mainly because she was never anywhere to be found, which is a shame. The beer list here is pretty impressive.

We sat at the bar where we were greeted by an attentive, empathetic and fun bartender. She was upfront about it being busy and she was honest about how to expect a small wait. She made sure to give her patrons their drinks first to keep them happy and quickly added food orders after that. Of course the food and drink were delicious and on point! She was working hard and continually thanking everyone for their patience. For the most part, everyone around us was friendly, happy and rooting her on. Thank you again, Kimberly, for a great last minute date night. You truly were the B-B-Best!",

Went in on the review recently from the Las Vegas Weekly to try the recommended vampire dip. So good! I'm not a fan of sourdough as they usually serve it in a bread bowl but they were nice enough to replace it for me. More cheese fondue than avocado dip, but I love it. Came back with a bigger appetite to try a burger. On recommendation from Genesis I tried the P. B. And Jellousy. She told me it was her favorite as well as the dip so it tried it. A bit adventurous even for me with Black Canyon Angus beef, thick cut bacon, natural peanut butter and strawberry jelly on honey wheat bun. Just the right balance of delicious flavors instead of making it over the top. The sweet potato fries with pumpkin sauce were also groovy. With definitely be back to try more recommendations. Such a great experience.",

Again long wait for food despite being empty.  Ordered grilled chicken sandwich. Wheat bun was hard as a rock & chicken extremely dry.  Hamburger just so so this visit.  Glad we didn't pay full price due to coupons or would have not been happy. Server Stephanie was nice & attentive.",

Everything was very tasty, the burger was a bit over cooked. Overall good experience also good beer selection and Sunday ticket.",

Also the windows needs more shade because I basically had to wear my shades at the bar. I'm sure management can fix this easily. Comment cards would help as well.

Hubby wanted to watch GSW game for date night and this popped up on Yelp with a pretty good star rating  near home so we decided to give it a try. Atmosphere seemed pretty laid back. The hostess greeted us upon entering and we were immediately seated at the bar. Freddie our bartender and waiter introduced himself almost immediately upon us being seated. FREDDIE IS AWESOME. He was very helpful when we couldn't decide what to choose. And he knows how to mix a great cocktail. David the manager was great as well. He was very involved with what was happening around the restaurant and making the patrons feel comfortable. We ended up ordering the Slater's Porkapalooza, chips and salsa and 50/50 burger. It was all tasty. My husband being a pork fanatic enjoyed every bite. Kind of sad that you can't order the Sweet & spicy agave pork wings separately because they are DELICIOUS. We will definitely be back again.",

Came out super hot but didn't stop us from diving right in. Husband got the BBB burger and I got the original 50/50 burger. Both were fantastic and the bun was super duper soft! I got my fries covered in beer cheese. So yummy. I was hoping to save room for ome of their awesome looking shakes but was so full i had to pass. Next time I'm starting with it. This is a must try place.  I know we will be going back for sure.",

We previously only used to visit during our annual trip to Anaheim, but were both excited to hear that we were finally getting a location here in Vegas! The new location did not disappoint. The burgers are delicious and there is no shortage of bacon. The servers are very attentive and friendly and the atmosphere is super laid back and fun. Overall, it's definitely one of the better sit-down restaurants in the Vegas valley.",

    "text": "So disappointed with this new restaurant that took over for our favorite neighborhood breakfast spot. Ordered the sriracha burger, where do I start, for as much sriracha as the description states, it had no flavor of sriracha. Which, I really wish it did, because the actual flavor of the burger and bacon was disgusting, tasted like old grilled shoes.  That's the best description I can come up with. I did not finish even half of a half because it was so gross.  The second order at our table was the BBB Burger. Well, he's been sick since eating that burger and that was about 24 hours ago.  The taste was pretty much the same as an old shoe. The last item, a kids pizza. The owner or chef or manager, whom ever is in charge of the menu selections must not have children. You don't change a basic thing. My child who loves pizza wouldn't even take more than two bites. The sauce is super sweet and the crust was so thin the cheese and sauce just fell off when you picked it up or tried to cut it. So he ate French fries which were the only thing that were actually enjoyable besides maybe the onion rings. So one star for the sides. I was going to order a shake, which looked amazing but after spending $50 on food that none of us enjoyed I wasn't going to order anything else. All in all, will not be back.",

Not the case, burgers get no temperature all well done had absolutely no flavor it seemed like the burgers didn't even have salt and pepper on them and they were dry not juicy at all ... i was expecting more from there burgers... shakes look amazing... save your 16$ and go to in n out lol",

Positives: 1) Solid Sriracha burger - although it wasn't what I ordered, I would certainly get it again. 2) Sweet Potato fries - a very good fry, not just small pieces overly deep-fried. 3) Pumpkin dipping sauce for fries - just wow, a home run. 4) Very good beer selection. 5) Bartenders were very friendly and patient as we took our time with the menu (darn 1st timers).  Negatives: 1) Got the wrong burger - bartender said it was one of her favorites, think she just had it on her brain, honest mistake. 2) Fries were not hot - luke warm at best.  Overall, thought it was a huge upgrade over the prior tenant.  Can they keep it filled nightly, remains to be seen, but I will definitely be back.",

Our server Gabriella was super helpful by guiding us through the menu and explaining the 50/50 patty option on the burgers, 1/2 bacon, 1/2 beef but they also have veggie and Turkey burger options as well which is great for people that like healthier options. The beer selection is outstanding and definitely worth checking out, I dont live close by but if I did I would totally do the $30 for a beer a day plan which is really cool. Melissa was also super cool too and brought us some beer samples which were tasty.. I'll definitely come back and check this place out..",

However, I ended up ordering fried bacon Mac and cheese with fried pickles for an appetizer, and I ordered the Hi-Brow Burger. The burger could do with a little less arugula however it was absolutely phenomenal. My girlfriend ordered the Lone Star Smoke Burger and she really enjoyed it. They have a large menu with an even larger Beer list. Definitely glad this place recently opened up, it's absolutely a place I will be going to not only try all the burgers but all the beers as well!

Management was NO where to be seen and our server was an obvious buddy of his because the only reason I saw the manager was because the server mentioned something. Even when the manager came over, he said nothing to me lo ike you w ou uld expect,  like is everything ok, how was your meal, there was nothing...   Paid the bill left a tip and asked for a business card so I can let someone in corporate know how guest are getting \"taken care of\" at the Henderson location.......

There was also plenty of Dragon's Milk rounding the table. Ask for a sample when you go - you will thank me later.  Don't be scared - it's dark, but so good.

The burger patties not piping hot either. Even though a food runner delivered our food, it got to our table too late. Food needs to be delivered to the tables as soon as it is ready and not let the food sit under the \"heat\" lamp. Overall restaurant appears clean, decent service and kid friendly.",

We made our way around the menu tonight and started with the mac & cheese bacon bites, and the double down with freckles and onion rings, some of the best fried pickles and mac & cheese bites I've had! Went on to burgers and ordered the Bison burger, Crispy Chili burger, the Original and the PB & Jealousy al a mode. My mom and I split the Original and Bison both absolutely amazing! Great flavor profiles, different but so worth it!  The king shake was something incredible! Full banana, covered in bacon, peanut butter, whipped cream and peanuts...oh my!! We will definitely be back!!!!!!",

Half beef half bacon patty with chipotle mayo guacamole and a fried egg on a wonderful brioche bun. All the burgers come with fries and bacon catchup. Flavor explosions abound. If you need salt the bacon salt is on the table. I also ordered the maple bacon old fashioned cocktail. Awesome!! Really my only complaint is the french fries aren't crispy. They are soft and not very good. They put so much thought into the rest of the menu and they totally forgot the fries.",

Service was superb, props go to Nicole for taking care of us and recommending the sweet potato fries with pumpkin dip.  Only reason it's not 5 stars is due to the price. Having to pay Strip prices for a burger while not on the Strip makes this place more of a 'once-in-awhile', instead of a 'frequently'.",

A suggestion - turn up the volume o the big football games. Onion rings solid. The burgers were the shame: you can not serve a burger as good as In & out At a $10 plus price. Staff never asked how I wasn't it cooked - so there was a sign . Burger came back smaller than a double and double. I can deal with nacho cheese being just hot cheez wiz as the place is cute and it has potential. The burgers were small. Brioche buns could not save a burger when it is so small - I don't think I need  to back go inn & out to get a double double that was much better. Ask to make sure that the server is ringing in the the order. Shakes are big. Great Place for shakes. Turn up to volume and add big burgers. Then you have a winner. Mine missed badly. I root their success on. Give Us like ass  burgers. We will Be back And do Not firm $10 planet Hollywood burgers that were nothing more the. A Wendy's singlE Stack. Has miss missed the mark.

Food is great, beer and cocktails are good too. Definitely a spot to try for a good burger and sports on tv. Must try if you love burgers. Try the 50/50 50 beef/ 50 bacon!!!",

And I liked that there were lots of it, instead of 2 pieces like most spaghetti and meatballs.

It was excellent and I was rewarded with the last lava cake with bacon that they had in the back! My boy who served me last time (Freddy) hosted trivia. He did a wonderful job and hooked us up for my birthday with a sparkler in my cake! I've been to the Pasedena Slaters and Vegas beats it HANDS DOWN! Met the owner and he took a pic for us!

    "text": "Slater's 50/50.. that name is telling for this burger joint on the south side of Las Vegas.  Fun ambiance meets overhype at Slater's.  I'd give it 2.5 stars if I could.  When you walk in you're greeted by dueling walls full of beer taps from around the world.  A great touch in the craft-beer era.  The restaurant is well lit, and clean although it's filled to capacity.  The staff are hustling and bustling about.  Service is great here at Slater's; the good part of the 50/50 indeed.  The food on the other hand is average, maybe slightly below.  We started with the porkapalooza, which I must say was awesome.  The pork belly with jalapeno jam was the best thing I had all night, and it wasn't even close.  I would recommend this appetizer to anybody who comes to Slater's.  For the meal, I ordered the 50 alarm burger.  As a lover of all things spicy, I was hoping that this ghost chili habanero monster would be just what the doctor ordered.  Sadly, this burger is hyped on their menu as 'you need to sign a waiver to eat' but it falls well short of that level (P.S. I didn't have to sign anything).  Our waiter informed us they were out of the whole jalapenos that go on the burger and only had sliced. Ok, fine, no big deal.  The burger itself was lacking flavor, and would have been spicier if it had tobasco on it.  It was in desperate need of some crunch with a squishy patty, squishy peppers, and squishy egg on it.  I added the fried pig skin to the burger and it helped the texture and flavor a bit, but try as it might it couldn't elevate this burger to the $17.00 price tag attached to it.  The frys were golden brown and looked quite tasty, except they weren't crisp at all.  I think that the frys are as important as the burger at any self respecting burger joint, but that's just me.  The food is undoubtedly the bad part of the 50/50z  All in all, this great idea falls well short of expectations.  Slater's will be just fine as they are playing to the bacon and craft beer crowd, but I'd be happier and would save at least 50% on the bill by going to In-N-Out or 5 Guys.",

Their burger (The Original 50/50) is without a doubt the juciest / freshest and on point burgers with it's menu. The meat is soft and has such good texture and tenderness. 10/10 the egg is sunny side up with bursts of flavor. And the Avacado compliments every bite with freshness and rejoice. The onion rings are both big and good portions / exactly with the burger. To top it all off the dessert was the icing / frosting on the cake  their Chocolate bacon molten cake is by far and if not my favorite dessert I've ever had in my lifetime (along with cookie skillets) :) I highly recommend my friends and anyone to come here and try it.

I partook in said burger, however I also tried their appetizer \"fried Mac and cheese balls\"!  I have to say I'm not a mac and cheese guy but anything fried is amazing and this was no different!  I have to give it to them, I loved this selection!  It is a \"MUST TRY\"!  Now to their \"Best Damn Bacon Cheeseburger\"...come on now, DO NOT make claims that are very rarely found and not live up to your own claim!  They had an extensive burger menu and after I ate said \"Best\" I felt like they took away from their own menu!  I would have tried any other burger to TRY Slater's fairly and honestly!  In my attempt to TRY a place, I eat the meal \"as is\".  The menu represented a lot of burger options that looked amazing.  I say all this because this was NOT the best damn bacon cheeseburger I've ever had!  I've had bigger, juicier and topped with more bacon!  At best I give it a 3 out of 5, middle of the road burger with bacon.  It came with bacon ketchup for the fries and that was ok.  Their sweet potato fries comes with an out of this world \"MUST TRY\" pumpkin sauce!  I'll be going back but solely to try another burger with those sweet potato fries and pumpkin sauce.  Service was a little slow and there was quite a bit of dirty tables when I arrived.  I sat in the bar area due to the dirty tables but that may have contributed to the slow service because I think the bartender also has to wait tables around the bar.  Not to sure about that.  I will be back though.  The place/meal overall was a definite 4 out of 5!",

She went above and beyond to the point where she brought napkins twice without us asking and she offered me a water to go because she remembered me saying that we live 35 minutes away and I had a long ride home. That is the kind of over the top service that you wish for every time you go out to eat.  The food isn't too shabby either. ;)  It's actually fantastic! I have the hardest time finding a Turkey Burger that doesn't taste like it was just pulled out of a freezer with absolutely no flavor in it whatsoever and I had a Turkey Burger that was absolutely fantastic. The rosemary parmesan bacon is so good and the pickled onions make it just over the top great.  My partner had  The Lone Star Burger with the barbecue sauce and onion rings and it was absolutely fantastic.   But absolutely do not leave here without having the Vampire Dip. You will be sad that you did not try it. It was so much better than I expected it to be and I expected it to be pretty great. I mean it's cheese and artichokes and garlic so what's not to love. I don't know what additional magic they put in there but it is phenomenal. (Fun fact:  You can choose vampire dip on your Burger as the cheese option).  We each enjoyed an Ace pineapple cider that was so good I cannot wait to have more.    A+ ya'll!!! See you again soon.  :)",

We arrived earlier than our reservations and the hostess let us know that our table was already ready, so she walked us right over and told us our server would be right with us. The store manager came up to us and said they were short staffed but he'd be more than happy to be our server.   I know being the store manager you have to have certain expectations as far as service goes and David went above and beyond! We ordered the Maple Bourbon bacon bone in wings and also some boneless Honey BBQ wings. They were nice and crispy and I prefer them that way. We decided to go with the Design It route for our burgers. Those never disappoint!   I'm so glad we were asked to come back, David won us back. He made sure we were well taken care of and I loved the fact that we wanted to hear me out about our previous experience with our service. He talked with us so much that my daughter even gave him a hug when we left, and she's super shy!  David and Andy, thank you so much for a great experience!",

Very efficient and kind, also gave us some other ideas of spots to try out in the neighborhood. The food was as the part we didn't really care for. I had the quinoa burger... not my cup of tea. My mom had the hotdog and didn't like it. Our friend had a burger and she said the patty tasted frozen and was too thin. The reason I'm giving Slater's three stars and not less is because my father enjoyed his egg burger.   Their beer selection is nice. We loved the Tenaya Creek IPA... seriously check it out if you haven't.  It's a neat concept, you just check off the items you want on the burger and hand it in, just wished that the food was better. Bacon lovers will love this place... they even have bacon infused chili pepper jam. They have lots of games you can play- foosball, board games, etc. Also a decent sized patio to lounge on! I probably won't be back but if you love bacon... go.",

    "text": "Looking for an informal early dinner, we tried Slaters 50/50 on the very strong recommendation of a friend. She did not steer us wrong. Located in a strip mall, there is plenty of free parking. The restaurant is huge with high ceilings and multiple TVs on each wall showing sporting events with the sound off. Dana, our server, was at our table right away, to get our drink orders ($2 off your second beer with a Yelp check in!). Getting through the menu to decide what to order is no small task. They do have a couple of salads if you want to behave yourself, but you don't come to a restaurant specializing in burgers that have 50% bacon in the meat in order to behave yourself. My wife and I decided to share the 50/50 Shroomin' Onion with a side of sweet potato fries ($15). Even a half a burger is large (see the photo). In addition to the 50/50 patty, the burger comes with sauteed mushrooms, fried portobello mushroom, caramelized onions, roasted red pepper, fried onions, and chipotle mayo. The fries come with a small side of bacon ketchup and a pumpkin sauce for dipping. Yup, it's decadent. But delish. They also have a huge selection of beers on tap, most of which I had never tasted. Dana was kind enough to bring a couple of samples for me to try before I made a selection.  For a sports bar atmosphere, the restaurant is surprisingly family friendly with at least half of the tables having at least one child (don't know if they have a kid's menu). Not the place to eat if you are watching calories or cholesterol. But definitely a fun place to eat for very tasty and somewhat unusual burgers.",

We were able to look over the menu twice and watch some baseball before server first came up to us.  Then there is the price, cost us 42.50 for one buffalo burger and one bacon burger, with 2 ice teas at 3.50 each.  Didn't get the $11 shake or the $17 bacon appetizer.  Traveled 20 miles for a burger I could get BETTER at multiple locations.  Red robin, fatburger, smashburger all better and cheaper options.  Finally if you are a fan on the original Slaters, which I am, were going to have to keep traveling to Cali.  The only thing that is the same is the name. No bacon maple Milk shake, no mac and cheeses, no bacon brownie. Just a below average burger joint.",

    "text": "The first time trying Slater's 50/50 was great for me! However not the best for my fiance.  First off, our waitress Lisa was great, very knowledgeable about all Slater's 50/50  has to offer. She was personable, friendly and attentive.  We started with the chips and dip. The chips were good, salsa was a bit watered down almost.. quest dip was ok as well. I was happy with it but found it hard to navigate around three giant jalapeno slices. Thinking next time i will try the vampire dip as a starter. A table across from us ordered it and it looked DELICIOUS! For my meal I ordered the hot chicken sandwich, with sweet potato fries.. YUM! I will be back for this! It has a great amount of heat for someone who enjoys spicy food. The chicken was fresh and crispy, not too heavily breaded either. I found the bun delicious as well, it was light however it held up well to the large chunk of chicken on the sandwich.  The sweet potato fries and pumpkin dip are delicious as well! Fried to perfection and lightly salted Truly like thanksgiving in a bite! Lisa was right( her suggestion). I will order those again too.  Now my fiance thought to \"play it safe\" and order something they are known for. He ordered the original burger and fries with bacon ketchup. My fiance was intrigued by the concept of 50 percent bacon and 50 percent beef. However was not blown away by the burger. I tried it and thought it was tasty however had much too much sauce on it making it kind of soggy. The fries were soggy as well so that was a bummer.  I am totally willing to come back and dine again because my dish was fabulous!  I look forward to trying the vampire dip as well as their shakes!  And ps LISA WAS GREAT!",

Our server, light haired female was friendly, however she didn't know the menu. Another server, dark haired female was good with drink refills. Burgers were good but we expected something more fabulous. The bun was a brioche and it just didn't taste as fresh as it should be. I had the Bacon  Chili Crunch, again good just not a lot of flavor. The Tots with the Green Chile Queso was delicious, as well as Onion Rings with BBQ Sauce. Although the burger wasn't the best I've ever had, I would go back They have lots of interesting menu choices, and a couple of items I would like to try. They also have an extensive beer selection.

The decor was very VEGAS, and our server, Nicole, was outstanding!!! She's great!! My burger-the original 50/50 was cooked perfectly and tasted so so good!! My fiancee had the pork belly flatbread and hers was also delicious!!  We both a a beer from their giant draft selection!! We came in around 1pm on a Thursday afternoon, and although it was lunch time we were seated right away!!   All in all we had a great experience!! The food was tasty, the service was top-notch, and we can't wait to try some more of the items on their unique menu!! We will be back!! Thanks again Slater's 50/50 for a great lunch!!",

Bacon ketchup, bacon salt, bacon on the burger and of course the meat is half BACON.  I could feel my arteries hardening as I read the menu.  But when you want BACON on your burger (and maybe a brew of two) this is the place!  Did I mention BACON?  I had the Sriracha Burger - two of my favorite things Sriracha and bacon (oh yeah - there was a bun too).  In any other place the brioche bun would be the star - here it has to play second fiddle to (wait for it) BACON.  I want to try some other things on the menu - but I need to wait until my blood test settles down.  Loved it!  Oh yeah and Lisa is a great great server!",

Hand made patties, cooked to perfection. A variety of fresh toppings. You can make your own burger or order one if theirs. I got the highbrow and my husband got the lonestar. In my opinion, mine was better. We both got a side salad which was also very good. Came with pickled onions, cherry tomatoes and cucumber.  The server was attentive but didn't hover.

I had the Pork Belly Benedict & it was delicious! My husband shared the Fried Chicken & Bacon Pancakes with our youngest daughter & they were both very happy with the meal.

Aside from their creative burgers, Slater's 50/50 has REALLY awesome shakes to order, both for kids and grown-ups (meaning there's something from the bar added to it).   I have my kids today, plus I'm not much of an alcohol drinker, so I ordered the S'mores shake virgin. Just the sugar rush I needed! My only suggestion is to FRESHLY toast the marshmallows until they are crispy. think they may pre-prepare the marshmallow in advance, so they were soft on the outside.   I also ordered the Ahi Tuna salad. It was the perfect amount of spice and a very large portion. I was not even able to finish it.   My daughter loved the chicken fingers and ranch. It came out piping hot, so be prepared to be blowing to cool it down for the hungry little ones.   We will be back to try the burgers... they are huge, unique and look decadent! Plus, they plate the burgers so cool and I'm sure they will look good in pictures.",

They have a decent sized menu; the majority is burgers, but they have something for everyone- veg heads and meat eaters alike! One of the most unique offerings are their sweet potato fries and pumpkin dipping sauce! I know it sounds bizarre, but don't knock it till you try it! The fries are perfectly cooked and the aioli type sauce takes them to the next level!   I wish they had more snacks and small bites on their happy hour menu. It's basically just tots or fries. However, most of their drinks are discounted and draft beers are a BOGO deal. Service has also been a little sluggish and blah during our visits, but hopefully those were isolated incidents.",

I was really hoping they would have a nice selection of beer.  So I would pop in to look at the menu.....Nothing is there for me.   I've done this several times.   So I gave up on the beer.  I decided to try there spaghetti.   1) For the price point, it's not worth it, not much spaghetti, ad you don't even get a side salad, and a garlic bread. 2)  It didn't taste that great!  I was very disappointed with the flavor. But while were in there picking up my order, we looked at the beer menu again, we saw they had a Triple Belgium!  Awwww, we got excited, decided to try a sample.   It seemed like it would be good.   So I went back just for the beer.  Almost $9.00 for the goblet.   If it's good, I don't mind.   But the more I drunk it, the less I cared for it.  Now they have an opportunity to have a great Triple Belgium beer.  They carry Lovelady's beers, and Lovelady's has great Triple Belgium beer.   I think as of right now, my hopes have gone down for them to have what I'm looking for.  But if you like IPA's I'm sure you will love this place, they have lot's of IPA's  and if your into sports, it's a great place to hang out.",

    "text": "Well...today was National Hamburger day so of course we had to go for burgers. I was craving cheese fries so I Yelped cheese fries and Slater's popped up. What got me was the post of a picture someone posted that had the vampire dip in it. I was hooked with that. Then I read the menu and their burgers sounded yummy.  We were seated and on the table was bacon salt. Interesting taste. I personally do not eat bacon but my hubby does. I know... I know...why would I choose a place known for their 50/50 burgers...well because they have Angus burgers also! Works for me. The hubby tried the 50/50 burger patty and he said it was really good. A good mixture...not dry at all. We had heard of places before with a 50/50 burger and that they were very dry...so they are doing something right!! :) He had the lone star: 3 huge onion rings, bbq sauce, smoked bacon, cheddar cheese and he got the tater tots with the green Chile cheese. I had the Hi brow: Black Canyon Angus beef, melted swiss and blue cheeses, baby arugula and roasted garlic aioli on a brioche bun...yes I copy and pasted this...lol...I removed a few items that I took off. It was DELICIOUS!!!  I am a huge fan of blue cheese topped with a solid piece of cheese on a burger to hold the blue cheese on!!! I have never had it with Swiss before though...very good combination.  I also had the tots and cheese upgrade.  Now for the reason I wanted to go! The VAMPIRE dip!!!! I truly don't even have enough words to express how amazing this was. Let's just say if you like cheese, artichoke hearts and bread as much as I do...with a hint of garlic also...then you will be doing the yummy food dance at your table like I was!!!!  Not only was the food delicious but the service was amazing too. We will definitely be back!!",

Our server Aaron was awesome too, never left us with an empty glass and that's a big deal for me.  So far my 2 favorites are the BBB and the high brow. They also do a breakfast on the weekends and cant wait to try that out.  They lost a stat because one of my refills had a big lipstick stain.  I used to work in a restaurant and can understand being in a hurry and not noticing the stain just after pulling a glass and quickly filling it.  However, it should have NEVER left the kitchen.",

The pumpkin sauce that comes with it is very creamy, like mayo. They do have regular ketchup as well.  Our waitress was nice and personable, and checked in on our table regularly. Would definitely consider returning to check out other items on their menu, try their ciders, or return for breakfast.",

    "text": "Came in tonight for dinner with my boyfriend and so so happy we did! This is absolutely the best burger joint I have come across in Vegas. From the extensive amount of apps, creative burger options, toppings for fries, etc this place will have exactly what you're looking for. We started off with the vampire dip and this was honestly the star of the show. It comes in a MASSIVE bread bowl- think Panera bread bowl x3. Filled with gooey cheese and artichokes and comes with pitas, celery, sourdough, and carrots- this dip is a meal in itself. Fortunately for us, we have bottomless pits for stomachs so ate the whole thing then ordered the PB and Jealousy burger and the Best Damn Bacon Cheeseburger with sweet potato fries and the loaded pimento cheese fries. The pb and jealousy burger was a type of burger I have always wanted to try and so happy I did! Lots of gooey peanut butter and strawberry jelly and it paired extremely well with the bacon and burger, had a sweet ending with the bun.   I will say the burgers are smaller then I expected- but this wasn't necessarily a bad thing, especially after that dip. For the bacon burger- this was a bit more generic for my taste, it lacked the pop I was looking for in like an aioli or maybe a bacon jam- it seemed just kind of basic compared to the other items we had had tonight. Nonetheless was still good.   Now for the fries, the pimento cheese fries were awesome- lots of bacon, cheese and green onion. The cheese definitely had more of a cheddar taste and reminded me of just standard loaded fries as opposed to an actual pimento cheese- so I was a little disappointed, but they were still super good just not really pimento chees-y. Now the sweet potatoes were out of this world good, and the pumpkin dipping sauce I would absolutely love to borrow and take home because that is absolute crack. They brought over some bacon ketchup and that was amazing as well.  In summary 2 absolute must haves here are the vampire dip and the sweet potato fries WITH the pumpkin dip, but you have to have the pumpkin dip!! Next would be pbj burger because wow what a combo. Service was great as well we had Cait and she was attentive and great!  Prices aren't bad here as well- if you have a car and are in town for the weekend, make the trip!  Food taste: 10/10 Value: 9/10 Service: 9/10",

    "text": "This local spot is a must. The reason why I say this, it's the service, ambiance and food! With 50 beers on tap and the 50/50 burgers, they are a must. I took my family, so it's definitely family friendly, and had the 50/50 original burger (which the patty is 50% pork and 50% beef with a fried egg! Yu) and the PB Jellousy burger. Yup peanut butter beacon jelly burger with ice cream! It's sooooo good. Don't knock it till you try it. I also had the sweet potato fries, that tasted like a warm pumpkin pie when you dipped in their homemade sauce. Their cheese fries are equally delicious, it just depends on your mood, sweet or savory. With 50 beers on tap, it's a breeze to pair your food with drink, they also have crafted cocktails if your not in the mood for beer. I give them two thumbs way up. Jeff, our server was friendly and considerate with our children. Can't wait to go back!   So we returned! And it was good. I still like the PB Jelliousy burger. I had a BBBacon burger and my son had a Bacon Chili Crunch. I really liked the flavor of the BBBacon burger over his. The egg on top was perfect. Remember that your burger always goes down better with a beer. I personally like their local selection as well as some of the breweries that hit the top of my lists like Founders and Pizza Port. The only reason why Slater lost a star in my book is the wine. Not that it's bad, it's the price and the amount per glass. Hear me out. I will pay 4x the amount for a bottle. That is normal. But if you charge 10 per glass for a pour that you get 8 glasses out a bottle that is $10 then that's 8x the amount.  not too cool with that.",

Only one place called for us as our wolf pack had not feasted in a length of time not normal for humans who come to the land of sin.  Slater's 50/50 knows the deal and the portions to fix such over indulgent needs of the human condition. The food, the beer selection and often upbeat tap your feet tunes will keep you more than happy that you chose to walk in.  We had the best of the best servers on our bacon and meat adventure Tarek. Yes meat fans, Tarek. From fist bumps to Naming self made burgers this OG Slater's slayer is the Top jalapeno- bacon Jam.   Don't skimp on the Vampire Dip and have Tarek hook you up with that Australian Wagyu!",

    "text": "Terrible burgers. Way overpriced. Suspect!  Went here for lunch with my girlfriend and we both ordered the backyard burger. She ordered well done and I medium. When the burgers were ready the waitress and manager stood at the expediting station and went back and forth with the cooks about which was which.   After a long wait the burgers finally came out. Both burgers were cooked well done and very dry. Bun was soggy and somehow stale. Tomato was the end piece of the tomato. Lettuce was brown in most places.   And I'm not done yet! There was a serving of fries for what I assume was for an infant. Because the few that were on the plate were soggy and undercooked. Also, I don't get why they call them Slater fries when they are frozen from a bag. Lameness.   The manager ended up comping the meal because even she seemed to think it was gross after I pointed out the abysmal failure of making a burger made by a...eh hem...burger place.   Seriously overpriced and low quality ingredients topped by incompetent cooks.   You're suspect Slater's!",

    "text": "First time here... And we really weren't impressed with the food. The 4 stars is strictly for the service.  1-they ran out of onion rings so my lone star smoke burger was missing that. Our waitress did advise me of that and she suggested sauteed onions, which I agreed to.  2-I ordered my burger w/out pickles and asked for the bbq sauce on the side. My burger came out w/ tons of pickles and bbq sauce slathered on the burger.   3- my brioche bun was so dry... It felt like it was more than a day old. The weird part, my friends brioche bun felt and tasted a lot fresher.  4- the other burger ordered was a bison burger and was missing flavor... Not sure what happened there. I ate my lone star burger but did not enjoy it because it was too sweet for my taste due to so much bbq sauce. I mentioned to our waitress that the bbq sauce didn't come in the side and they gave a bunch of pickles. She apologized and ended up taking the burger off the bill.  I didn't make the complaint to get my burger for free but I did appreciate the gesture. We'll probably go back so we can enjoy the ambiance and watch the VGK games there and enjoy some beer. They have 50 different beers! That's absolutely nuts!",

I promise you won't be disappointed!   After visiting this place I became one of those freaking foodie-like people that I tend to quietly judge when I see them taking photos of their food.

    "text": "We are locals here.  We eat out every single day. We recognize that the restaurant business is a difficult and tricky business to achieve success in. We eat in divey out of the way places and in high end restaurants (think Hank's in GVR).  It is with this in mind we write reviews.  Executive Summary:  There are many \"burger places\" in the valley. They all claim to be wonderful and most are.  But not all are EXCEPTIONAL, which Slater's 50/50 is.    Don't miss eating at Slater's 50/50.  It is excellent.  It is not just another \"hamburger joint\" - this is quality food, excellent selection, superb preparation, outstanding seasoning and amazing service (ask for Kat who is remarkably attentive, experienced without being obtrusive!)  This was our first time in (The Boss has eaten at another location before but I have not.).    I was expecting \"In and Out Burger, 5 Guys, Smash Burger, Fat Burger, Habitat blah blah blah\"   Not even in the same competitive market.  None of the aforementioned burger joints can remotely compete with Slater's 50/50.  This place is a very comfortable environment, high end quality menu with quality preparation and service.  I ordered the \"Best Damn Bacon Cheeseburger\" and it was.  The Boss ordered the \"Rosemary Turkey Burger\" and it was moist and delicious, unlike most turkey burgers.   We also ordered the Parmesan garlic fries which were absolutely perfect, delicious, wonderful.   Additionally we got the sweet potato fries that came with a delicious pumpkin dipping sauce.   Really, I was shocked at how terrific our lunch was.  An extensive beer menu is available, including flights for sampling.https://slaters5050.com/beer/   Each month there is a beer of the month and there is, without a doubt, a quality beer for every beer taste.   In addition they have a remarkable drinks menu that includes a \"Maple-Bacon Old Fashion\", \"Hickory Smoked Bacon Bloody Mary\", and a \"Spicy Pineapple Margarita\" among other delicious concoctions and potions!  Our server Kat was knowledgeable, friendly, helpful and a general delight.  She offered great advice, was always available without being overbearing.  She exemplifies what being a good server is and is really a credit to Slater's.  Manager Cindy came by to check on us and we appreciated her interest.  We gave her the same feed back you see printed here.  I'm old, cantankerous and cranky and I expect excellence.  I'm vocal and I like to complain.   Having said that, we commend Slater's 50/50 to you without reservation (and our server Kat who made the visit very pleasant).     We'd be happy to answer any question you may have if you simply send us a Yelp message.",

It was steady busy, not packed. We were seated immediately.  Menus and drink orders were taken right away. My seat had a view of the kitchen and expediting area prior to food being delivered to the tables. The lady that expediting was AWESOME! She gets a big . She was busy, but kept her kool the entire time. She even caught a mistake they made with my order before it arrived at the table. The kitchen seemed a little frazzled at times; I don't think they communicated well. It's still all new so that will come with time.   Our food was good, not great. The only things that I noticed on my burger (BBB) was the bacon was old and hard, like it was made hours ago. My family members enjoyed their food.   I'll be back!",

This time around I tried the BBB Burger, I'm a sucker for a gourmet burger with an egg on it.  It was amazingly flavorful, a perfect balance between tastes of beef, bacon, egg, and bacon!!  The beer-cheese fries were good, but not as tasty as my wife's choice - the chili fries - don't pass-up those chili fries!   Already looking forward to our next visit.  I predict Slater's will become a LV favorite in very short order.",

I really wish I could have thrown up what I ate because I felt gross.  The only positive was the fries.  Whoopty do  The novelty of half ground bacon and half ground beef is nothing more than that, a novelty. I'll never go or recommend this place.  I'd much rather have a normal burger with bacon on it.  The ground bacon doesn't offer any special flavor, in fact it detracts from the natural flavor of the beef.  McDonald's provides a higher quality.",

Unfortunately, after snacking on that and waiting for the burgers to come out, I felt like throwing up. The burgers came and I couldn't eat mine. Not because I still felt sick from the dip but the way the burger tasted. It had some many flavors that did not go well together. I know bacon is salty but damn, this thing was too much. Worst part of the visit here was when the server came by to drop the check and ask how everything was, I was honest and told her I felt sick and couldn't eat my food because it was not good. She apologized and took my card. I spent over $50 on food that I didn't eat and stated it was not good. Hopefully this doesn't happen to anyone but I will share my experience with my friends.",

First time I came in Genesis was awesome, sweet and a great conversation. She recommended the Original 50/50, and it was excellent. This time I decided to order the Sriracha burger, which was an interesting flavor combination. Next time I think I'll go for an all beef burger for comparison, but all in all I'm incredibly happy with the service and the food. Genesis is a day bartender, and I definitely coming in for lunch with her. Freddie works evenings, and he's super cool, friendly and hospitable. Come see Freddie for dinner some time.

LV needs a good off strip burger joint, LV  strip burger joints just do not cut it ....  1st time I had the Original, not a bad burger, was it worth the price and a 30 minute wait, no! I'm just glad I wasn't on my lunch hour. Like most burgers the roll consumed most of the burger. I'm not really sure if the burger was cooked too well, I would think after 30 minutes it should have been.   2nd visit, with a friend this time, we both had Sriracha Burgers. I received my burger in pieces, he didn't. I brought it to the attention of my server she looked at me like a deer in headlights, that is all. Not very impressed again. Rather than be attentive to the issue I was asked if I'd like to have a another beer, they like to push the beer after all they do have a good beer selection. Unfortunately I'm not much of a Beer Drinker  Because of my second issue there, I'm giving this 2 star a because it's not deserving of anything more there was no communication letting me know my burger would be so long or the fact that she didn't even acknowledge or care about serving me a burger that was in pieces, but I was asked if I wanted another beverage.

House made bacon Ketchup was very good, i asked for some extra, server quickly delivered some additional ketchup. . Service was good, attentive and friendly, without over doing it. i didnt have room left to try desert, but i have my eye on a return visit to try some.",

The atmosphere was really fun as well.  We had Vampire dip for an appetizer and it was so hot and fresh and most importantly delicious   my husband ordered the High Brow with a double patty and it was so big and flavorful.  My son had the kid sliders and those were pretty big for kids sliders. My daughter ordered the PB and Jealousy and we were all a little jealous   I ended with the 24k Burger and that was the DAMN BEST BURGER EVER! The flavors were just jumping and bursting all over my mouth. I savored every single bite and I could not finish it. We will definitely be coming back! I definitely think Melissa deserves some recognition for all of her suggestions and expertise  THANKS SLATERS 50/50  for having delicious food and awesome staff! I'll definitely recommend this place to all my guests and recommend Melissa as a waitress!  I am a hotel concierge and I wish you guys can open a place on the strip so I can go for lunch!",

    "text": "I regularly visit this chain in california and love it so when I heard they where coming to vegas I was super excited. However, it turned out to be a let a down. It took forever to get our food...it took so long the manager gave us a vampire dip on the house. And when the pork platter came out, it was a disappointment. The pork belly resembled burnt jerky, the pork rinds were soggy, and although the picture in the menu and on the advertisement prominently displayed in the middle chicken wings. \"Pork wings\" came out instead. I asked about the chicken wings and the girl said that they are supposed to pork wings and that was a common misconception. Which seemed like a moranic reply cause the all the pictures clearly show chicken wings. And one of the waiters asked if everything was okay and we told him about the pork belly, he immediately went to the kitchen and brought back a new order, which was a plus! So all in all, I really want this place to succeed cause it really is a great chain in California. I'm gonna blame most of the issues on the fact they they're been open for just a week and are still training. I give it a couple of month and I'll try again.",

We came opening weekend (sunday) and it was a bit busy, nothing crazy but we opted to sit at the bar. And we are glad we did as we had an amazing bartender ( Jeff ). As we were overlooking the menu we werent really sure what to get, although we do know we want to try everything once someday. We placed our orders and Jeff very nicely suggest to change our burger order from the Original 50/50 to the PB&J ala mode (a pb&j burger w/ icecream?!?). Reluctant but willing to try we obliged. Needless to say, we didnt regret going with his suggestion. Who would've thought, i highly suggest trying it if you're having a bit of a sweet tooth or a little daring. We also had the Vampire Dip, wow! Another hit!! I wish we took photos :/ aha. Jeff overall gave an amazing experience to the point even IF the food wasn't great we'd go back just for his service. Overall making my review for slaters a 5 star.   P.S if you get Jeff as your bartender and happen to like Arnold palmers, tell him and let him make you a drink ... you'll love it.",

    "text": "Before coming here I would recommend checking out Hi score on blue diamond close as it in my opinion has better service, food and beer list. As this is a chain restaurant I have been to 1 other Slater's and was looking forward to this dining experience. Let me start with I love GOOD beer and am a beer snob so the offers taps as only marginal at best and when they can't even bring those out right or tells me that they need to bring in Jon Taffer to save them and train the staff to recognize when they bring you the wrong beer in color and smell. I requested a taster of barleywine and they brought me an ipa not interchangeable by any stretch then ordered a flight with 2 stouts and we get 3 yellow beers at which times the runner argues with us that it has to be correct and server finally realized we were right and she did offer to make it up to us with a free beer she was earning them 2 stars in this review so far.  All this occurs as the managers (yes managers plural) walk around never once coming up to us and asking how it's going. Then we order food and it continues to go down hill as the restaurant is nearly empty at 2:30 pm in the afternoon and it still takes 25 min to get 2 burgers and fries (which 1 was not as ordered) and as you can see from the picture while the place was clean there is a lot of staff standing around not contributing to a good experience taking them down to 1 Star. Overall slow and poor trained staff, bad management, and fair food with marginal beer list there is much better places in vegas to spend your time and money at.",

Many others were seated after us and we began to notice they were receiving their food before us.  Our waiter never came back from the time he took our order to refill our drinks, to say our food would be out shortly, NOTHING.  We had to flag down a different waitress to find out what was going on with our food.  It finally came an hour and 10 minutes later with a simple \"im sorry\" and thats it.  When he came back with our check I requested some sort of discount for the ridiculous wait ...he went and spoke to the manager and our bill was then cut in half.  After we paid our check we hung out for a little bit when a woman (possibly the sou chef/or a manager) came over to check on our experience.  We didn't want to make any further fuss since it was all taken care of but she proceeded to ask questions so we shared our experience.  We were very blessed when she went above and beyond and brought us gift cards asking us to give them another chance.  I so appreciated that amazing customer service in the end and will be giving Slaters 50/50 another chance.",

The burgers we had had a great taste to them even though we asked for medium and received well done. The wings we had were outstanding but my thoughts were 12.00 for 6 wings they had better be good. As good as they were I feel a little over priced. My other huge disappointment was they gloat they have 50 beers on tap and it is an extensive menu of beer but no Heineken on tap!  Really??? 50 beers and no goddamn Heineken!!! For that reason alone I will not be returning!!!",

Keep it going guys and you'll all be successful. The table tried the Poke nachos. Not as good as Yard House. But. The poke was bomb. Need to perfect that mix of chip to topping ratio.  It was definitely tasty tho. Mac and cheese bites were hittin. The dipping sauces are all a must. We live around the corner but we'd make the drive from 20 mins out to come back. Thanks to Isaac too.

    "text": "We've been very curious about the new Slater's 50/50 that opened near us. Just got a chance to try it. Absolutely fantastic burger!! The 50/50 mix of ground beef and ground bacon creates an excellent and juicy patty. The fries and bacon ketchup were also very, very good. Lexi was our server. She did a very nice job! Asked if we had been in before, and fully explained the burger concept and the entire menu. Great service! Can't wait to go back and try the Spaghetti with 50/50 Meatballs and Marinara..",

Let's start with the burger its juicy its savory and of course if a great choice. The sweet potato fries with comes with a pumpkin sauce (PSL lovers know what I mean) they complement each other so well the chef's obviously a show off and I'm okay with that. They got 50/50 patties that's right half beef half bacon grounded together to make something some ppl would describe as \"holy **** that's sounds awesome how the **** did I not think of that\" plus they got bacon strips if you dedicated. Over 50 taps they got a lactating dragon in the back if you want some new holland dragons milk (11% abv).  Also Jeff S. was my server funny dude, prompt service I recommend asking for Jeff S.  Also my buddy will be starting a food blog soon when it starts I'll put in the IG.  P.S. you smart you loyal theres some money buy yo moms a house",

The food was pretty good, all the games were on the TV's, and the beer selection was good.  The biggest reason we've returned most every Sunday to Slater's is due to a waitress we liked very much.  Last Sunday, after spending  over $400, we learned that she had been fired for hanging around past the end of her shift in order to close out our tab!  FIRED!   SINGLE MOM!!  WE WON'T RETURN!!

Freddie is a fantastic guy! No other way to say it, Dino himself is also a great guy he's brand new first day here and did a great job himself. Slater's is famous for having lots of beers on tap which I really enjoy also any kind of drink that your heart desire they'll make it here for you. They've got a great attitude and the place is super chill  Good for watching sports of just having dinner on your own like me tonight. The food is delicious  I had the chips and dip also their FAMOUS 50/50 original burger and it was hands down the BEST burger I have eaten in Las Vegas!  Eating that burger got me very excited! I live just a few blocks away so i will be returning to Slater's often, not only cuz of Freddie and Dino also cuz of the amazing food and great selection of drinks! Definitely a great chill spot.  Really sad to go from 5 stars to one star. Why? Bcuz last time I was there just over a week ago, I had the wings it tasted rancid and simply disgusting! I was SO disappointed! Also ordered again the 50/50 original burger and this time it was not good at all, undercooked nearly on the raw border and just not good. Even the drinks were bad, I asked for a gin and tonic and got what appeared to be a gin and water, just flat and no flavor and just not a good taste. Then I decided to ask for a jack and Diet Coke it came 3/4 DC n maybe 1/4 jack also not tasty and definitely not enjoyable. When I was there last time I was at the bar by myself and had a great experience. This time I was with my girl at the restaurant side and really excited to take her there! What a mistake...  on top of the food and drinks being a huge disappointment, the price was also ridiculous! 2 50/50 burgers, 7 disgusting wings and a couple of less than acceptable drinks cost me nearly $90 dollars... who am I kidding?  Slater's you lost a great loyal customer.  Life's goes on! On to In n Out we go!!! Burger time",

Because it was our first visit and we weren't just there for happy hour, we ordered food and 2 rounds of drinks anyways.  The bartender, Genesis, was really into herself, dancing and flipping her long hair around. Even going as far as to take food from a regular patrons plate and eat it behind the bar.  I'm sure the health dept would have been thrilled.   Also, I'm vegetarian and although she double checked that I didn't want bacon on my impossible burger (which I appreciate), she then made fun of the fact that I came to a place known for bacon.

Fries were over salted and when I asked the waitress for a mix of regular fries and sweet potato fries...she said sure but didn't deliver. Very sad. Had high hopes for this place.

Now the food; I ordered the Brussel Sprouts and wow, even minus the bacon, they were great - not greasy, balsamic sauce/sage and real parm, no complaints. Warning: everything contains Bacon.  Overall, good food, good energy and the staff was great. Will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Don't bother with this place. A sad & pale misrepresentation of the tasty and high quality Slater's we are used to. We went here Saturday about mid-afternoon. I've been to many Slater's in Cali and wanted to go when it wasn't crazy busy especially since this one is a new NV outpost. Beer list was okay and had some decent NV local beers. Nothing spectacular on the beer list but the service was horrible. My gf asked for a taste of a barley wine and a very yellow beer was brought to the table. Both of us looked at the beer and said nope. Not a barley wine. Runner & server disagreed. Oh no that's the barley wine. Tasted it and yep it's a IPA. Requested they go back and try again. Hmm, a more caramel barley win was delivered. Server had to agree the first one was not what we asked for. I ordered a flight with a wheat, two stouts, and a saison. A flight came with three yellow beers and a stout. Uh, I think you are wrong yet again. They tried to convince me a very yellow IPA looking beer was Dragonsmilk. Nope. Try again. Came back with another flight with the correct beers. Ordered my burger medium well and it barley hit the medium mark, and bacon crispy and still limpish. Server asked how things were and I told her \"worst Slater's ever\". There were two managers hanging around the server station but neither of them bothered to stop chatting and work the restaurant. We did see the server stop by them after I made my worst Slater's ever but still neither budged from their chatting post. The managers at other Slater's I've been to were much more proactive about checking on the quality of their store. I guess I'll save my Slater's visits for when we are in Cali or hope for better when they open other locations in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Where to begin, one and done. To sum it up our group was more than ready to leave at the end of this one. We came in with a medium sized group of about 8/9. The restaurant was dead and our server (Lisa) was finishing up a large group of 25-30+ so a other server started our drinks, which is understandable. After drinks came out the server took appetizer/dinner orders. Dinner took about 45-50 minutes to come out. The cooks in the kitchen could be seen and heard screwing around while we were waiting on our food. The first round of beer that came out was about 50% wrong and had to be sent back. I ordered garlic fries and my friend ordered a 50/50 burger which we split. The fries we alright. Not much garlic other than the pieces of garlic clove sporadically thrown on top of the fries. The fries were good and cooked to completion so not much to say other than that. The burger was too much. There was not much flavor variety in the burger. It was too rich in my opinion. There was nothing to break up the flavor and nothing to really bite into. Very mushy. I ate half of my half of the burger. I couldn't get through it and I do not consider myself to be a picky eater. Someone at the table got the sweet potato fries which comes with some sort of pumpkin sauce. The combination of the pumpkin and the sweet potato was fantastic. I would definitely recommend. Especially if you have a bit of a sweet tooth. It's just right. A member of our group also ordered a milkshake to come with dinner. This did not come until we were asking for the bill. She tried to cancel the order because after waiting so long for our dinner we were just ready to leave. The milkshake came out and she was not charged for it. It took a long time to get beers refilled and I was only drinking water and had to ask to be refilled. Also the floors were extremely sticky, I'm not sure what it was but the entire restaurant was sticky which makes me wonder what the kitchen, where they cook the food, is like. The bathrooms seemed to be mostly clean. The men's and women's rooms are on opposite sides of the restaurant and getting from one side to the other around tables is a little difficult. All in all I would not recommend this place. The service was beyond poor and the food was mediocre at best. I must say the beer was cold though. Might be a good place to grab a quick beer at the bar. Wouldn't recommend more than that.",

Just as we sat I heard table next to us complaining...our server Renee came by and introduced herself. We got waters,she explained the concept and took our drink order.  Totally ruined the experience for my daughter when she was told that there were no milkshakes. Renee said that they had to work on serving before they served shakes due to the time they take to make. Why open if you don't have a full menu?? We ordered the $12 Chicken Wings....at $2 a wing not worth it. Yes you get 6 wings for $12. I got the 50/50 Original Burger minus the egg add lettuce and tomato. I couldn't believe I was charged 50 cents for lettuce and 50 cents for tomato. I omitted the egg....they could have let the veggies slide. Kinda ridiculous. Watching Fox5 news Sunday morning with Mr. Slater promoting the place. My burger was on there twice the size with the guac and mayo oozing all over the plate. Mine at the restaurant didn't look ANYTHING like it....DECEIVING. Good luck guys.",

The hostess was so nice  as was the rest of the staff. They asked if we wanted beer samples or water while we waited and went over the menu and offered suggestions. Once seated we were helped by Ish. He was great, kept our drinks full and checked on us regularly. We started with the Bacon Mac and Cheese balls which were delicious and they come with a ranch tapatio dipping sauce. My husband got the BBB Bacon Burger and I had the Hi Brow Burger. He enjoyed his burger but thought it was a little dry. The Hi Brow Burger has blue cheese and swiss on it. I thought the blue cheese was a little strong but if you love blue cheese this burger is for you. Overall we really enjoyed our meal and look forward to going back and trying some other dishes. It's great to have a new burger option in the neighborhood other than Red Robin.",

The menu is just right in size with enough options for everyone. We ordered the porkpalooza appetizer which is like a pork charcuterie plate. Everything tasted good however the ribs were a bit dry. For main course I ordered the Siracha burger lettuce wrapped and medium temp. While we waited for food I ordered one of the local IPA per server's recommendation which was good and I ended up ordering another. Once the burger came it was cooked to temp and wrapped nicely in the lettuce so it didn't get completely sloppy like I have had happen in the past. Everyone else at the table enjoyed their food as well and no complaints to be had. The kids really got a kick out of their over the top milkshakes. Will definitely go back to try other things on when back in town.",

    "text": "Lousy service !  It's Thursday night, it's slow... our waiter did the minimal effort possible.  The burgers were well made, but they were warm not hot...because the burgers sat in the kitchen window for five minutes. (Attached picture).     The Manager should find out what is going on in the back room, ...that's where your staff was hanging out.  Your establishment has an open kitchen for a reason, and it displayed the kitchen staff and other wait staff watching food sit in the window.  No urgency, no ownership?   The low rating goes to the waiter who did the least work possible....and to the kitchen staff that let food sit in the window.  This was my first visit. This restaurant is a sloppily run ship,  and there are better restaurants in the same strip mall to spend my money.",

I didn't get a beer (trying g to cut some calories to start the year) but the beer menu was great and I definitely will want to explore it in the future.

Overall was an experience that I wont forget anytime soon! The food was excellent along with the service, I got the vamp dip, the original 50/50, and the s'mores monster shake.

    "text": "So we've seen this place many times while going to Island Pacific, Lucky Thai, and Dunkin' Donuts which are all located in the same plaza. We decided to give this place a shot since the family was craving burgers. The restaurant itself was clean and had plenty of space. We came in during NBA All Star Saturday Night with the three point shoot out playing on several televisions inside the restaurant. This would be a good place to catch games. We were greeted in the front by the host who got us seated promptly. Upon first glance of the kids menu, we were happy to see the variety of items for kids. From burger sliders to pizza to chicken fingers; there was plenty of options for them. My wife and I were looking at the burgers. This place is called 50/50 cause the mixed half of their burger meat with bacon. My wife decided on the Best Damn Burger and I got a Bison burger in a lettuce wrap with sweet potato fries. I ordered an extra patty since it was only a few dollars extra. My burger was okay. It wasn't spectacular but it wasn't horrible. The lettuce wrap kinda sucked. It quickly fell apart which made a big mess. A toothpick to keep it all together would've helped. Larger pieces of lettuce for the wrap would've been better. Overall, the bison burger was VERY average. My wife touched her burger but didn't care for it much. My son and oldest daughter had the sliders which they enjoyed. My other daughter had the pizza but didn't finish it which wasn't a good sign. It was also very thin and definitely not worth the price. The appetizers we ordered were the tater tots and onion rings which were the best part of the whole meal. I don't know what's up with this place; but you have to request ketchup which is weird for a burger joint. We had two cups of ketchup between five people but I digress. For the two burgers and three kids meals with drinks; we paid over $75 which was waaayyy overpriced for a VERY average meal. That is two sodas, three waters, and ZERO alcohol. Although everything was fine, I doubt we'll ever come back. The prices were ridiculous especially when you have Lucky Thai, which is amazing, in the same plaza. You have Red Robin down the street whose burgers taste better and prices more reasonable. We ain't tourists so stop charging locals ridiculous prices for average tasting burgers. We ain't on the strip and we live close by. You lost potential repeat customers which means $$$. Step up your game, there's so many other burger joints in the area.",

Definitely will return on a regular basis if for no other reason than to talk some football with David and sample some beers",

I'm going to say I understand since it's the first couple of days and they need to workout some kinks, but there is no reason for a simple beer taste to take 45 minutes to receive. Or an appetizer taking 50 minutes. Or the fact that our vampire dip was dropped off at the wrong table. The simple stuff was jacked up beyond all recognition. My family and I walked in at 8pm and our main entree didn't arrive until after 9:30pm. Also the egg on the burger was 90% raw egg whites and yolk, hopefully I don't poop my pants tonight. Scott Slater was even in the building witnessing this all go down, but it didn't make a difference in service. With the food taking an hour and a half to get, you would think a business would comp your whole check, but not this place. They comped our bread bowl that took an hour to get, and that was all. So we went home with a grumpy tired baby well beyond her bed time.  I'm from San Diego and I loved the Slater's in Liberty Station, so hopefully with time and direction this place will be as good as that one.",

We needed ketchup and water refills, but only one waitress was near our section & she was clearly overworked and didn't notice us.

Shoutout to the bartender, Jeff, for his recommendation on the \"PB & Jellousy Burger.\" One of the greatest things I have ever tasted.. it's an Angus burger with bacon and a Peanut Butter and Strawberry jam; served with a side of vanilla ice cream.. Absolutely, amazing!! Definitely recommend this place and I will be returning very soon (A++)",

    "text": "Went here with my family and it was incredible!! Server was awesome, all staff were super friendly and couldn't be happier to get outside of our usual area to eat (we live super north) so the drive for us was worth it and we will be back. We came with our kids and no one left disappointed. I ordered the PB & Jellousy Burger with a 50/50 patty (super yum!!) and if I didn't have my kids with me I would have seriously added the scoop of ice cream (it's gonna happen next time!) the only change I might made to it was maybe kick the jelly up a bit with a sweet chipotle jam but that may just be personal preference. My husband ordered the 50/50 OG Burger and it was a beautiful thing. The egg was cooked to perfection! Slightly runny and tasted deliciously cheesy (perfect for this burger!) and the avocado mash had even my husband who's mostly anti-avocado (seriously who did I marry!?) liked the avocado and said it was done really well and he would eat it again (Win for the guy who'll eat avocado but won't make a meal out of one like me!). Kids ordered buttered pasta and pizza and we took a bite of the pizza and were surprised at how good it was and kind of shocked when it came out that it wasn't some sad looking freezer pizza you could find at the store. But the best part of the night for our little entourage was the shakes. Husband and I share the Ultimate S'Mores Shake and it was perfect. Love that the graham cracker was not fully submerged and soggy, thank you for that!! Our girls split the Happy Happy Birthday Shake; I just wish I could share video of my 5 year old in her seat with the squee dance she did. It does not disappoint, especially when it comes to the kids. This was their first Twinkie experience (and this much sugar but it was a family night so treat yourself!) and the sparklers, pushed it over the edge. Kids had an experience and we made memories, laughed a lot and enjoyed our total dining experience. Yes, I was surprised that the sparklers were the old school metal ones from back when I was a kid. Owner/manager promptly removed the hot rods as soon as they went out so our kids didn't burn themselves (thank you!! I still have scares on my feet from stepping on them one 4th of July when I was little.) Also, thank you for not using kraft Mac & Cheese in your Bacon Mac & Cheese Balls.. it makes a difference and the dipping sauce was perfect, the right amount of heat without setting your mouth on fire so you can't taste anything.",

It is the main reason this restaurant will be a Must in our rotation. We both really liked the burgers and fries we had, but it's special items like that Dip that make this place stand out.",

They have lettuce wrapped as an option, but I personally don't enjoy my burgers lettuce-wrapped.  EDIT #1 - altered review rating (can't delete) based on manager's response; will try to eat there again soon and update pending our experience!  EDIT #2 - Went back to Slater's upon knowing they did have gluten free buns. The meal was good. The menu is noticably lacking compared to the couple locations in socal I've been to; in summary, I'd give the restaurant a 4-star rating as a whole (seems pricy for what you're getting, and not a lot of customization compared to the other locations in the franchise), and I'd give the customer service of the management staff a 5-star.",

    "text": "Just attended the grand opening. Decor and music are very contemporary. Great beer selection with a good mix of craft, local and favorites. The menu is strong in its bacon theme, with several new twists for people whom consider Pork to be their candy.  Ordered the Vampire Dip, with extra veggies for dipoing, and 50/50 burgers.  My wife is Gluten-intolerant and they were very accomodating.  Vampire dip was astounding, and reminds me of my homemade alfredo, in dip format.  The burgers are definitely the star here, with their patented 50/50 blend of ground beef and ground bacon.  They come with a great smoky flavor and more tooth than your standard burger. My wife, who is a True burger aficionado,  love the new take on her favorite food.  Place was bumpin' since it was their grand opening, but all the staff was extremely courteous and competent. A special shoutout to our server Renee, who kept us up to date and happy throughout the busy service period.  It's rare these days that quality, care and convenience all coincide, but with this location being walking distance from our house, I am sure it will become our regular hangout and a Date Night favorite.",

In NC, you either have a beer garden with a sucky food selection or a sports bar with an okay beer selection. This is the perfect marriage of the two. I'm a craft beer \"fan\".. working my way to an aficionado. Huge Kudos to David.  His hospitality, knowledge and customer service was out of this world.  My selection was the Dragon's Milk Bourbon Ale.  My perfectly paired food selection was the Bison and Bacon Burger.. and I mean perfectly paired. I commented to my daughter that I was actually sad when I took my last bite of the burger and sip of the \"elixir\". The Dragon's Milk immediately got my to my top 3 list.  I also picked up another one for my rotation... Asylum from Left Coast Brewery. I think I may be able to get it from my local Total Wine.   This was so awesome an experience that I am seriously looking into an opportunity in the Raleigh area.. Wish me luck!",

The bacon could not be cooked completely inside the hamburger meat making it noticeably greasy.  Fresh is always better but this was good just not great. Fries were crispy but previously frozen. The location was in a strip center.   I would recommend you try it it's novelty is worth the try",

Walked in and stood at the empty hostess desk, 2 other parties shortly arriving behind us. No-one at the bar, 2 servers at the kitchen, backs turned talking to each other while we all waited for easily 6 minutes. Finally seated with maybe 30% of the tables filled. The whole meal was long waits for the server to get around to us for drink order, then food order, then forever for the food.....The burgers and fries were really good, but after we were finished and had waited another 10 minutes for the check, I finally went up to the bar where our server was and got the check. During our meal we saw others arrive to the same situation, one of them waited a while, then went to use their bathroom and left!  I love that they are no smoking, but we can go to Destihl near our house and get a decent burger with 5 star service in less than a 2 hour experience!",

For my lunch entree, I am having the 24K Burger (fresh-baked Brioche bun dusted in 24-karat gold with three slices of thick cut Billionaire's (gold dusted) stacked on 1/2 lb WAGYU beef, truffle cheese, arugula, jalapeno-bacon ham and roasted garlic aioli). To maintain my slim figure, I am having a \"Slater's\" salad. Wow! What presentation. My friend ordered the Vampire Veggie flatbread with their Vampire dip, piled with artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, mushrooms and red onions. For my last drink, I am trying the Lovelady Paleo Porter (5% ABV, 28 IBU) with a similar smell and taste of peanut butter and then goes to chocolate and coffee. Burger bacon is a bit spicy and the bun gold coating is a bit buttery. There is glitter all over the place (my face, pants, shirt, etc.)...",

It's a Chill and clean environment with super friendly staff. Beer was so refreshing and paired perfectly with our burger (I got the cali creamsicle beer). Staff and our server took the time to talk us about how the food was and even gave insight on how it's cooked. We had gaby as our server and she was really helpful when we were putting in all of our substitutions! Highly recommend!",

    "text": "Wow, this place was awesome! I went with about eight friends last night to try out this place. I went in already pretty hyped to try a burger made of half bacon and half beef, so I was hoping they would not disappoint. I was definitely torn between the 50 Alarm, Sriracha, and PB and Jealousy burgers (Peanut butter, jelly, and ice cream on a burger? Say whaaaaat?)  In the end, my buddy and I both signed some waivers and went with the 50 Alarm. Is it all that spicy? Nah, the waivers are just cute little hype machines. I think I took maybe two sips of water the whole time I was eating it to give you an idea of the spice level. BUT and I mean this is a big but (hah), this was definitely one of the tastiest burgers I've ever had. I'm not big on eggs on burgers, but it worked perfectly in this case, and the flavours were delicious. I was quite impressed. I also had the sweet potato fries and that pumpkin sauce? Amazeballs. I ended the meal with the Guinness adult milkshake. I consider myself a bit of an adult milkshake connoisseur, and while it was good, I don't think it was enough to warrant the $10 price tag. I was also happy they were able to get all of our food out hot and pretty quickly despite it being a relatively large party.   The only real downside was our server asked if we wanted to split checks at the beginning of the meal and we said yes, but when one of our party needed to leave a bit early and asked for her check, she ended up getting charged the whole bill. Bit of an unpleasant surprise expecting to pay $20 and getting charged $200. It wasn't a huge deal, but just a bit of an inconvenience and we would've preferred to know if one person had to put the whole bill on their card.  I'll definitely be back for their lunch deal. I'm pretty sure the PB&J burger is on that and it'd be nice to get a deal on that in case those flavours just don't work for me.",

    "text": "I heard heard raving reviews of the California franchise of Slater's 50/50, so when I found out there was one in my home town, I just had to try it!  Weeks and weeks had gone by, yet I never had a reason to be in Henderson, so I made one, and it was to visit this Slater's.  Upon arriving, we were greeted and sat at a table. Right next to our table, yet slightly behind us, was the waitresses computer area where they do whatever it is they do. One of the things they most likely did was overhear our conversation about our opinions on our experience, which I'm sure they quickly learned was lacking.  I'd requested on of their custom burger menus, at the recommendation of friends, and couldn't wait to dig into a juicy, custom made burger, as I'd been fasting for the past 36 hours. Yes, this was my first meal in over 36 full hours!  I decided on treating myself to a higher end cuisine, and I'd seen their 24k burger as for $24. I figured, if that's their high end burger, the one I build would probably be about the same price, if not cheaper, and mine wouldn't even be \"dusted with gold!\"  Boy was I wrong (but more on that later).  Their menu gave the option of a single patty, double patty for +$3, or a triple patty for +$5.   It also gave various choices of meat, but to my point, the Australian Wagyu option had indicated +$5.  The menu described its toppings as being \"select up to 4 toppings. Additional toppings are $0.50 or priced as marked\"  I opted for a triple patty, Australian Wagyu, with 4 toppings, and a regular bun and waiting for my meal to arrive. In the meantime, I also requested of their shakes (the King Shake).  My burger came and I was excited to bite in. However, to my surprise there were only 2 patties. Nonetheless I went to dig in, until I noticed that the fried egg topping is ordered had been cracked all over, causing the bun to be soggy and impossible to clutch. Again, I dug in anyways.  My first bite was as you'd expect, yet lacked the Wagyu consistency and taste I thought I'd get. Oh well, I'm sure the outer parts might be a little more done right?  Wrong.  The entirety of both Australian patties were far over cooked, well done. Might as well have thrown the burger to the dogs at this point. But remember, I hadn't eaten in 36 dang hours, so I wasn't about to wait another half hour for a remade burger. I ate half of it and informed the waitress of the overcooked burger and lacking of the third patty.   She brushed it off, and basically acted as if nobody had ever complained about a burger before (she didn't seem like she knew what to do aside nod her head). The excuse over the missing patty was that the Wagyu was a 1/2 lb patty. So? I can read a menu, and I'm aware it says 1/2 lb right next to it, and expected 1.5 lbs of meat.  Even to this point, I'd still shrugged the entire experience off as \"oh well, it happens. Let's not be those people.\"  Then the bill came.  $33 + toppings + taxes + tip (just for my burger)  Suddenly this experience was much more expensive than I'd expected. A $40 hamburger - where's my gold at?  I politely asked the waitress if she could explain how my bill came to so much, and she said she just walks the food around, and got a manager.  Manager walks over and acts as if the waitress sent him over without telling him the background of the issue (doubtful but who knows). I explain to him all the problems we've had, and how I'd been let down at my Slater's 50/50 experience that I'd been looking forward to, and broke my fast for. As a reminder, I was missing a patty, had a soggy bun, was overcharged on my bill, and my Australian Wagyu meat was way overcooked.  I was shocked when he didn't care about literally anything I said and simply offered me half off my burger (not my bill). So you're telling me that it's still a $20 Burger then? Okay, fine, and I'm willing and able to pay it, but why should I pay for something that was overc.... and he walked away while I was in mid-sentence.  Manager comes back over, hands us a bill and a coupon for buy one get one beer, with purchase of an entree, and walks away. I look at the bill and he comped the burger. Okay, fine... but he made his point now that he just wanted us \"complainers\" out of his restaurant.  Don't worry about it, we won't be back. And we left the coupon for you too. I'm sure your other customers need it more than we do.",

    "text": "This place is impressive. The entryway alone is built to beguile tap handle lovers, but unlike many other establishments with showy entrances, this venue actually backs up the visuals with a beyond decent beer list/wall that showcases plenty of local brewery selections.   The burgers are, whoa. Any burger can be substituted with the 50/50 patty, which consists of 50% ground beef and 50% ground bacon.   I had the turkey burger after much internal grappling. After a quick but contemplative inner dialogue, I decided I'd be happy with the turkey patty topped with pepper jack, rosemary bacon, and some kind of warlock aoli. I was not disappointed. The dude I was with, I call him my husband, had the original 50/50, and judging by the speed at which the sandwich disappeared, I'd conclude it was pretty scrumptious.   With screens everywhere, it's difficult to miss a single play of any game you're needing to see.   So, yeah. Go here. Todd was maybe the coolest server ever. He overheard the conversation I was having with my four year old about how the green shavings on his pizza weren't a big deal, and without hesitation or even a question, he brought a greenless pizza for our picky little cherub.   The fun didn't stop there. We were planning to order a cup of vanilla ice cream for that picky 4 year old to finish out the experience. When I asked Todd if they had ice cream, he said, \"we do, but we also have amazing shakes.\" We ordered the Birthday Shake topped with two Twinkies, plenty of sprinkles, three dum dums, and of course whipped cream, topped with sparklers, yes, sparklers. It was magnificent. See photo.   We'll be back.",

It was delicious and filling.  Ahi was fresh and flavorful.  Timing was a little off. Served our appetizer and within a few minutes our burgers came out.  Not very happy about that.  Also the Parmesan fries were weird.   They were crusted fries.  Sort of dipped in batter then fried.  And there was this weird garlic paste that wasn't mixed with the fries very well.  Not a fan.  We never got to try the milkshake bc burger fries and nachos were very filling.  For a solid burger  I would come here again.  Nice to see something different pop up.",

    "text": "I came here over the weekend for a holiday office party and was able to try a few menu items including the original 50/50 burger, vampire dip, buffalo wings, and sangria (I don't drink beer so I can't comment on whether or not they are good but they had a large selection). So I heard from friends that this is a chain that started in California and is known for the burgers being half beef and half ground bacon so of course it sounded delicious! Well I'd have to say when I got my burger I wasn't very impressed. The sunny side egg was still a little undercooked and the burger patty tasted like a frozen patty you find at any grocery store and tasted a little burnt. The fries and the wings were both average but tasted fine, nothing to complain about there. I would say my favorite two things of what I ordered were the sangria and vampire dip. The sangria was strong (I got buzzed off of it after one LOL) but a good balance of a fruity taste as well. The vampire dip was delicious...it's just full of cheesy, garlicky goodness haha. It was so good that I was trying not to fill up on it before my burger came out.   So I have to make one final comment on the service...there was about 50ish people for our party and we had 1 server who was doing the best she could. She got some help here and there from the kitchen staff too so props to her for doing such a good job. I'm sure it's not easy remembering everything for a party so large.   Overall, when it comes to the food, I don't think I'd come back anytime soon because I'd rather get burgers elsewhere but the staff was great!",

I've been in quite a few times and haven't been disappointed, even though I find that the menu is quite a bit different than what I've experienced at other locations in California.  If you aren't familiar with the concept - the 50/50 means that their burger patties are made with a mixture of half beef and half bacon. It's something to try at least once, but not all of the burgers are made this way, so if you don't like it, you can order something else! I'm a fan of their beer selection, there aren't enough places that serve a decent amount of True craft beer. And it's wonderful to see them carry some local beers as well.  They have a great $10 lunch special and a decent kids menu too. I'm not usually a ketchup fan, but I have tried what they serve with the fries and it's unique and tasty.   The service has always been really friendly. Overall, we've enjoyed our experiences there and look forward to going in for brunch and to get some bottomless mimosas soon.",

She really went above and beyond for us. Since it was our first time, she helped us decide what sauces would be best for the chicken fingers, what we might not like and gave me background info about the restaurant.

The amount of knowledge this man had on beer was just insane. I saw a beer that looked cool (don't laugh, I'm not a beer guy) and I said I wanted it. He said he would be happy to offer a suggestion of something better. So I thanked him, and took his advice. Got a way better tasting beer (sampled both). His attentiveness to our needs was unmatched, and his personality is very energetic and welcoming. He is the bartender that you wish to find at every bar. This Slater's is better than the other locations across CA. Will definitely return at every opportunity, thank you for a great experience.",

Service: 5/5 Food: 6/5  The first time I went, it was a packed house with a 30 min wait. Thankfully, we were seated in about 10. I ordered the original 50/50 with regular fries and my boyfriend got the BBB bacon with sweet potato fries. We also tried the pineapple cider on draft and a Stella. Food took about 30-45 min to come out.. that was a huge downer, but it was opening day so I understood. The burgers were incredible! Huge so well worth the money. The best and most unique part were the sauces to the fries. The regular fries come with a bacon ketchup and the sweet potato fries come with a pumpkin cream like sauce. Both are AMAZING and a must try.  Now.. the 2nd time around we were seated immediately and the food came out in less than 15 minutes. This time I decided to try the PB and Jealousy burger. Yes, peanut butter, jelly and VANILLA ICE CREAM on a BURGER. Sounds like a lot of intense flavors in one, but they actually complement each other very well. The best burger I've ever tried and not too sweet as some would think.   Definitely would recommend this place and will be a returning customer :)",

We started with the Porkapalooza appetizer, and it's not worth it. The bacon was decent, the pork wings were actually great, the pork belly was far too tangy, and the kettle corn and pork rinds were sad little after thoughts that tasted quite stale, as if the bag they'd come from had been left open too long.  The burger itself is... okay. I had the PB+Jealousy, the wife went with the OriginalSlater 50/50 and they weren't bad. But they weren't great either. For the price I was expecting much better - like actual juicy ground beef, not a sad grey patty that had little flavor and looked quite a bit like those pre-formed patties you get at Sams Club. I'd asked for the grilled jalapeno to be added to my burger, and I'm glad I did because the extra spice was nice to have. But I was a little surprised to see I'd been charged a dollar for it when it came time to pay. A bit of warning beforehand would have been nice. That said, I should have expected it considering the $4 can of ginger beer that started the meal off.  Oh, and the fries? Dry and cold. As far as sports bars go, this place is overpriced and under delivers. I doubt we'll be going back.",

It's a nice update from the restaurant that was previously in its spot.  I also have to commend the restaurant for having a well-designed menu. Mouthwatering descriptions. Impressive beer list too, and I appreciated how they worked with local breweries, such as my favorite Crafthaus.  Okay, this is where I begin to feel slightly guilty for my 3-star review. The food was just up to par for me, comparing it to other gourmet burger restaurants. Perfectly cooked and constructed burgers, but just up to par. Maybe I held too high of an expectation? Or maybe the service was eating into my meal too?  Service was great going into the experience from the hostess until my fiance sent our server back to the bar 'cause he ordered a Captain & Coke, not a Jack & Coke. Could visibly see the server's body language change, along noticing the less friendly tone of voice when returning to our table afterwards. I'm a fry addict, so the moment he put a couple dirty napkins on the plate, taking away the sweet potato fries as we ordered a second round of drinks, my mood just plummeted. Wanna ask if we're done first?  My fiance would like to give this place another try, so we'll see how that upcoming experience turns out.",

    "text": "What a great experience! We have been to Slater's in San Marcos a few times, and were surprised to see that it was here in Vegas. We went, tonight, and had such a great time. The food was great as usual, the beers were awesome, but it was the people and the service that really make this place so amazing. We were already talking about \"we gotta come back here\" 30 minutes into us sitting down. Tarek was our server, and he was great. Right on time with everything, super nice, and didn't rush us... and we definitely took our time. David was floating around and was at our table quite a bit. Let me tell you, this guy made our night. Truthfully, even if this place was just ok, I'd come back for him. Such a nice guy, super chill, great energy, and it all just came natural, he wasn't trying at all (he's Hawaiian, so it totally makes sense). Not long after we started talking, he was kicking me samples of beer, talking about our families, sharing pics, all that. Can't say enough about him... He's my kind of guy for sure, and we'll definitely be back to see him, soon.  It's a burger spot, so you can't go wrong with the food. They have so many variations of burgers, but you go for the 50/50 patty... half ground beef, half bacon... amazing. The topping options are awesome (avocado mash, billionaire bacon, bacon ketchup, etc), and the fries are on point. Good ranch too, and that can be hard to find. There's an endless selection of beers, and so many are good, but they're cool about letting you sample some so you can make an informed decision. I could say more, but just go try it out and do yourself a favor!",

We visit the one in San Diego all the time while on vacation and were so excited to see one open here in Vegas! I got the lone star burger which is basically a bbq burger with onion ring on it. It comes with fries which you can pick regular or sweet potato fries with pumpkin sauce. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE PUMPKIN SAUCE! They have a wide selection of beer and cider on tap, this time I got the pineapple cider and it was really good. My husband got the peanut butter dark beer and I'm not usually a dark beer person but it was fantastic! I really wanted dessert because their milkshakes looked amazing but I was way too full to even think about ordering one. Our server Todd was very attentive and friendly offered advice to our friends who had never been to a Slater's before. The restaurant was pretty quite compared to the one in San Diego where you have to use open table to get a reservation or wait an incredibly long time. Also have I mentioned your burgers are 50% bacon and 50% beef? Amazing right?!?",

On top of that they've literally turned bacon into their own food group. Give this place a try you won't be disappointed. But come with a big appetite!",

The owner was a really nice genuine person and the service was on par. Everything was actually fantastic and the vampire dip actually came out better than in Cali.  BUT.. I'm giving them 4 stars because my favorite thing about Slater's is the concept of designing your own burger which is a thrill for me since I'm vegetarian. The owner assured me that this will be something they will offer in the future when the cooks get their feet wet. Aside from that, if you haven't checked them out please do..  and order the vampier dip!! I've been making copycat versions during the holidays for years, but never as good as there's.. yum yum.",

Omg this place blows In n Out wayyyy out of the water (and I actually feel kinda bad saying that). Their bacon burger and their bison burger are SO good. Add in their amazing fries and bacon ketchup....it's a done deal. Wayyyy worth the money (and calories), this place is like bacon burger heaven. So. Good. And the beer was tasty too.

We walked in and were seated right away (Also ready to watch the VGK game which was starting). Our waiter (Alex) was extremely friendly and attentive. He asked if we had been there before. We explained it was our first time so he explained a little about the menu. We showed him a coupon for a buy 1 get 1 free appetizer. He recommended the Vampire Dip. We got that and the Bacon Sampler. Both were down right amazing. We then ordered a couple of burgers (Lone Star/PB and Jelly). Wow... Honestly I don't really care to do reviews on Yelp unless the experience was really great or really poor but this place was a home run. The Exec Chef (Andy) stopped by and made conversation and checked on how we liked the food. So bottom line is the atmosphere was great, the staff was excellent and the food exceptional. If you read the other reviews, they gave lesser stars due to the price but you get what you pay for. Yes, there are cheaper places to grab a good burger but I would put them at a reasonable price for the quality and taste of their food. If you're like me and get coupons for all kinds of places in the mail, save this one and go check it out.",

    "text": "Holy cow!!! Or should I say holy bacon!?! This place was an amazing find. We both got the BBB Burger made with 1/2 beef and 1/2 bacon, topped with bacon, cheese and egg. Absolutely incredible burger. The porkapolooza was awesome as well as the Siracha Thai wings. I can't say enough about this place. The King shake at the end just topped off a perfect meal that hit the spot. Our server Marisa was great.. very friendly and informative. We enjoyed chatting with her. We will definitely come back and recommend this place to everyone.",

They beat many places w their service.  From hostess to server (Nicole-5 stars) to even the manager (David- 5 stars)...they ALL were knowledgeable and professional and had an overall attitude like they were all happy to do what they do.  There are enough beers on tap from staple brands to new local surprises to make me want to come back.  The sweet potato fries are the best I've ever had...period. Definitely a place to hang w friends. This place will probably be a great place in hockey season. Do yourself a favor and check it out",
