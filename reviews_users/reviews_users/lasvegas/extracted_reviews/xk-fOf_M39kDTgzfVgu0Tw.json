I had a breakfast burrito. It was good, but not anything special. Plus it took so long that it was cold by the time it hit my table. It wasn't even busy in there so I'm not sure what the hold up was about. My fiance's over easy eggs were a little too runny too.  I like the concept of this place but it really missed the mark. Freshness is good but if I'm going to pay a few extra bucks I'd also like it to taste interesting and not bland.  Giving fresh hippie a bad rep over there.",

Would consider going back and getting something else.",

The menu items warmed our inner foodie. The omelette I ordered (\"The Favorite\")had sun dried tomato, basil, mushrooms, goat cheese and Avocado. It was to die for good. My sister in law said that the Kale Berry smoothie was perfect and my brother said the potatoes were crisp and fluffy and the bacon should be labeled steak bacon LOL Everyone at the table was so glad we found this place. Next time we visit Las Vegas we will make a point of stopping in. PS Even if you are full, buy a Pecan Bar for the road, you won't regret it.",

Not an easy accomplishment. The food was fresh and tasty and abundant.  Everything was ready when we arrived. We ordered from the catering menu and had a variety of sandwiches, pastas, salads, smoothies, and desserts. There was not a single miss in the bunch. My favorite was the signature pasta, and the kids loved the traditional pasta, and the wraps and sandwiches. Everyone loved the desserts. The staff was very friendly and super helpful. I have set up many team meals and this one was by far the best. If we were local, I would do every team meal there, and if we return to Vegas, we will definitely go back.",

We get amazing breakfast burritos, roasted potatoes, yogurt parfaits, fruit, OJ and coffee all for a little over 20% less than whom we had before.The catering previous was OK, but just a basic continental with scrambled eggs.   They also do lunches for us sometimes and their chicken curry wrap is a huge hit along with the Asian salads. Another pleasing aspect is the people and service. Wonderful to work with and always fix any issues immediately.   Of course this actual location is great as well along with the one in the Lou Ruvo center. I've been to both a couple times. Thanks for saving the day for us at least once a month! So refreshing to have better food for less along with crazy good service.",

I also ordered a sandwich from them that was not listed as having nuts. When it arrived at the table, I saw the nuts and was immediately disappointed (as I am severely allergic to tree nuts). But upon seeing my disappointment, the server apologized profusely, and had them make me something new on the spot. Very nice! Also love that they deliver :)  EDIT: Come to find out, the issue with the chicken salad sandwich I ordered was an honest mistake, and none of their sandwich contain nuts. So the menu was not incorrect in the listing of ingredients, it must have made it way into the sandwich on accident!",

The food here is delicious, I love everything on their menu. You can tell that everything is fresh. A little more pricey than other places, but you definitely pay for the quality of the food and it's worth it. The people that work here are incredibly nice and polite.   I'm giving two stars because half the time when I order to go, there's something wrong with my order. Either they forget to pack some of the food, or they totally give me a sandwich I didn't order. Sometimes my food is not made the way I wanted it to be made. It's just really annoying because it always happens. Sometimes I don't bother saying anything and sometimes I make them correct the order. Whoever is packing the food to go needs to pay more attention because the number of times all of this has happened to me is ridiculous.",

Now that I am working a few blocks away at The Mob Museum, I visit this one more frequently. On my last visit I had the breakfast burrito. The burrito is freshly prepared and I can taste the individual ingredients. I like the breakfast burritos here because they aren't overly salty or covered in sauce. I am a fan of the simple side of potatoes as well because I can choose what I put on them as opposed to them coming heavily salted.    As I am kind of a coffee fiend, I like that they have almond milk as a self-serve option beyond your typical milk and cream!   The location is nice because the dining area is fairly large, a great place for lunch (or in my case usually breakfast) meetings. The staff is friendly and attentive and the facility is one of the cleanest places to eat downtown.   I am happy that I have a healthy option nearby that is also kind to my wallet.",

Owners Kathy and Karen have put together an awesome staff and a perfect menu, and the result is consistently good, healthy fare.  I've worked my way through most of the menu, and the highlights (for me) are the salads, smoothies, and the omelets.  I live nearby, so I'm there often, but haven't grown tired of the food; could never grow tired of the lovely staff.  They have wifi, the place is immaculate, and  the seating is incredibly comfortable (unlike other spots nearby).  The crowd is a mix of DTLV start-up pioneers, attorneys from the nearby courthouse area, and tourists who prefer fresh squeezed juices (try \"Sweet Greens\") rather than being another snout in the Fremont Experience trough.",

Truth be told, I was dreaming about this sandwich last night in my sleep and was excited to know after boot camp that it would be the next meal consumed.   Oh....so back to the 440....grilled chicken, goat cheese (I think it is the goat cheese that really pulls this together), avacado, roasted red pepper, roasted tomatoes and lettuce.  The wrap makes it snug, which I like, but you can also have it on bread.  Delicious!   Healthy, delicious and in DTLV (downtown Las Vegas)",

The staff was friendly enough and recommended the pasta and Mac & cheese so that's exactly what we got. I ordered the watermelon juice to drink and the Mac and cheese with added chicken for my meal.   The watermelon juice was warm when it came out, had to add ice cubes to it. Warm watermelon juice? Not good. The Mac and cheese was very small. I'm not a big eater at all but I ate up what they served and was still hungry. My fiance got the angel hair bolognese and a smoothie and the bill came out to $40. Pretty pricey for a small meal. I tried my fiance's bolognese and it wasn't anything special. Honestly feel like I could've cooked that meal better myself. I'll save myself the trip and the money next time around.",

My hubs wanted a breakfast burrito.  I opened up Yelp, and there it was. Some other Rachel before me had opened a kitchen here. And there were salads, and they were good!  The food was inexpensive relative to the quality (less than $25 for the two of us) and there was a young woman singing and playing guitar while we ate. I don't always like live music, but her voice was really good, and it was really nice.   If you're in the area and craving some whole food, this place is worth a stop.",

Rachel's Kitchen has a wide variety of different food and drinks to choose from, so I'm sure even the pickiest of eaters will find something they like.  Also, on certain days this location has live music from local musicians. So it could be worth it to stop buy, grab a bite, and enjoy some music as well.  Overall, this place is awesome and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for somewhere to eat, grab a drink, and relax Downtown.",

Working Downtown at The Mob Museum, it can be hard to resist temptation - thank goodness for Rachel's Kitchen! It's a great atmosphere with even better food, and there's something for everyone. I've tried several menu items and am never disappointed. The best part is, my coworkers can still have pasta or a burger (with more wholesome ingredients) and I can grab something off of the lighter menu. Short on time? That's no issue either. Rachel's Kitchen is not fast food, but a great, quick meal.",

When I do go in to either pick up take out or sit down, everyone there greets you as you walk in and are extremely nice.   The food at Rachel's always tastes so fresh. Which i love. I'm also vegan and they have a really good veggie wrap and salad i'm able to order. The fresh juices are to die for, especially on a hot day when you don't feel like eating too much.   The food does take a while to get out, but it's worth the wait in my opinion. They also have a nice breakfast menu.",

I had the roasted chicken and grilled vegetable salad.  I was originally put off by the price (around $14 with extra chicken) but was overall very pleased with my meal.  The veggies were fresh and the flavors balanced well.    I was more blown away by the service.  It seemed to be taking a little while for my salad and I was beginning to get impatient but nothing excessive.  A woman came over (Rachel?  The manager?) and had the presence of mind to ask me what I'd ordered and immediately checked on it - that doesn't happen too often with takeout orders in my experience.  She was so gracious and wonderful.  Thanks for that Rachel's Kitchen - I'll def be back!",

Kathy the owner has a big heart and extends her restaurant and cooking skills to the nearby elementary schools.

My husband was home with me, picking up the slack of the house chores since I was unable to really pitch in.  We ordered Rachel's for lunch and had it delivered to out door.  It was so yummy!  He had the Traditional Tomato Basil pasta and I had the Garden Pasta.  We even had enough for left-overs!  We also tried the energizer juice and the fresh pressed watermelon juice, both were tasty!  I love having good food in the building!  Thanks Rachel's!",

I went for lunch and ordered the turkey burger wrapped in lettuce with a side of regular fries. I haven't had many turkeys burgers so I don't have much to compare to, but it was juicy and pretty tasty. The fries are skinny just like I like but they were pretty cold when served. I went back a second time and ordered the same thing and the fries weren't as cold but still not as hot as I'd like. The meal was a little over $9 and I felt satisfied when I left.",

When we had been waiting 45 minutes I called to find out if they were on their way. A very rude guy answered the phone and said my order had been ready and was waiting there to be picked up. When I said it was for delivery he said \"No its not\" and hung up on me. I called back only for him to answer again. He placed me on a 11 minute hold and the woman who answered said they would remake my sandwich and 2 juices and send them right out. It is now 12:45 and I just called back to find out they had not been sent out yet. What a fail! So dissapointed Rachels Kitchen. Get your ish together.",

I normally will come here when I want food that's tasty, healthy(ish) and that will keep me satiated throughout the workday.  I usually order the Chicken Caesar Wrap with a side of their sweet potato fries. Like the name suggests, it's a Caesar salad in a wrap. They don't get greedy with the chicken, which is sliced thick, and the contents aren't drenched in dressing. What I like especially like about the wrap is the option to substitute the flour tortilla for a wheat tortilla.  Their pecan and chocolate brownies are sweet and fudgey. They're a little on the heavy side, but they make the perfect, shareable desserts to top off a meal.   Lunchtime is full of diners, making it difficult to find a seat. Plus, parking can be bit of a pain. Although, you could place an order for either pick up or delivery.   Rachel's Kitchen is a great addition to the handful of local restaurants in Downtown that serve food that's delicious and made-to-order.",

Our whole group came in for breakfast and I opted for their green juice and an acai bowl. The green juice came, loved it, everyone loved their juice, they were really good! And then my acai bowl came....  First of all, it was really small. The acai blend was really liquidy and thin. There wasn't all that much of it since the granola they added took up the entire bowl. The granola is gross. Straight up. There was no crunch, no flavor, just chewy oats, and there were a million and one raisins in it. I honestly could barely taste the acai - it tasted just like bananas honestly so they must not have added enough acai. There were some strawberry slices on top but nothing could compensate for the terrible granola. The granola to acai ratio was just insane and why does there need to be so many raisins?! It was a miserable breakfast experience and I had to force myself to swallow each bite.  While the juices I recommend, I was just too disappointed by my acai bowl :(",

I travel and in the US, especially LV, in the sea of All You Can Eats, Fried Meat chains, and 14 for 1 pizza, it's even more difficult to find heathy options. I'm not a vegetarian but like to eat plants when I can on the road. I often search out Vegan restaurants just for healthy options, like I did the previous night. Once again I left such a place disappointed at the lame choices and basic lack VEGETABLES in my $35 VEGAN plate of tasteless hipster feed.  I'd eaten breakfast at Rachel's last year and just recalled being stuffed(!). Swung by this time for a lunch sandwich or something. WOW! Forgot the great choices offered! Ordered the smoked turkey/ Avo sandwich and took a chance on the side salad. No chance whatsoever with this choice! No typical US 3 leafs of iceberg/2 tomato wedges, and a crouton smothered in bottled Ranch, here!!! Hallelujah!!! A base of dark leafy greens, diced tomatoes, nice pile of julienned carrots, cucumber slices, with a soy based sauce (I think). Awesome! But, I'm pretty sure even my turkey sandwich had more vegetables on it than my \"vegan\" meal the night before! Nice pile of dark, fresh greens, tomato slices, and the avocado. I'm really not exaggerating. Even two choices of fresh made iced tea. Feeling healthy and stuffed again. I'm looking forward to breakfast here tomorrow before heading out.",

Anyways I ordered 3 smoothies, my sister got a peanut butter smoothie and it was disgusting so we wanted to exchange it. The manager, can't remember her name but she gave us a $3 discount off instead of just exchanging it for free. So I still came out of pocket $5 for another smoothie. Because of that I will never be visiting that place again, overpriced $6/$7 for a smoothie. Might as well go to Jamba Juice and pay the same price for a quality smoothie with great customer service!

    "text": "So I'm new to this Yelp thing, but decided it's time to write some long overdue reviews on some of my favorite places since I use Yelp all the time to find tasty foods in nearby and far-away lands!  I've eaten at this Rachel's Kitchen several times since it opened a few months ago.  I generally stop in when I'm downtown for a business meeting or to meet with the City or County.  Usually I just pop in for a quick smoothie since they're so good, but twice now I've found myself there around the lunch hour.  The place has a decent lunch crowd and it seems a steady flow of people ordering take-out.  I even noticed they have little delivery bikes out front! Very cool...unique to Vegas for sure!  Anyhow, both lunches I've gotten sandwiches (once the 440 and once the curry chicken salad) and both were excellent, with the 440 being a new favorite I find myself craving.  I got sweet potato fries on the side both times.  They get em crispy here and just ever so lightly salt them with what looks to be like coarse sea salt or something like that.  Maybe I'm the only one that pays attention to things like that??  Everything I've ordered has seemed very fresh and made with good ingredients.  Maybe some of the other reviewers caught them on an off day or when they were just getting momentum, but after stopping in here about 10 times, it's been very consistent for me.  On my next trip, I hope to give the mac-n-cheese a try...I saw someone eating it and it looked great!  I'm a sucker for a good mac-n-cheese!",

It was so greasy and the quality of the ingredients were poor. I have been to healthy restaurants were the food has a lot of flavor and tastes much fresher, but the food here is always pretty bland. I think the reason it is so popular because there isn't an alternative choice.   I do like the Popeye's Secret juice.  Hard to mess up on juice though.",

It was delicious. Big thing for me, it was a normal portion. Free wifi and a counter overlooking the street with charging stations. Small intimate place.

As most of you know, downtown is known for bar hopping and the famous heart attack grill. So if you're looking for some healthy refreshing food, Rachel's Kitchen is the place to go to make up for all the greasy dining! Great for vegans/vegetarians.   I was craving some greens and needed something refreshing so I got the Spinach salad: It came with fresh baby spinach. bacon, tomatoes, mushrooms, caramelized pecans & goat cheese tossed with lemon herb vinaigrette. You also have the option to add chicken or tuna. I added on the grilled chicken. The salad definitely hit the spot for me. The grilled chicken was perfect, not too dry and it went well with the goat cheese. To be honest, I'm not really a goat cheese/feta cheese kind of person, but it wasn't overwhelming as I expected it to be. There was a balance with all flavors and I appreciated that because I really don't even like dressing on my salad sometimes.   For beverages I tried the Energizer it comes with beets, apples, carrots, lemon and ginger root. I absolutely love ginger in my juices because it always adds a \"ZING\" to the juice. I recommend this juice for people that aren't really familiar with juicing, its similar to regular juices and doesn't have that (sometimes overwhelming) green plant taste.   Definitely will be back!",

It is soooooo good. The staff and the owners are very professional as well. If you are ever in downtown las vegas, Check out Rachels Kitchen. Next I want to try their smoothies. :) Try the Peachberry Smoothie its delicious!",

I went twice within a 2 day span, once for lunch and another time for breakfast.  For breakfast, I got Scrambled Eggs with Tomato and Basil. It was exactly what I needed.  Came with toast and some potatoes, but perfect breakfast to get my day started without being too heavy.  For lunch, I ordered the Signature Salad with chicken. At first it looked huge, but it was the right size to satisfy my appetite.  Everything on their menu actually looked really good, so I don't think you can go wrong with any of your choices.  Beats ordering from the hotel cafe or a local coffee shop! They even make fresh squeeze juices and smoothies.",

Their fruit was (surprisingly for me) the biggest highlight, as everything just tasted good, and wasn't mushy like some fruit selections can be.  Their breakfast wraps were also really great, with a few varieties mixed in there, and each tasted great, as did their french toast bread sticks.  The lady who brought everything was incredibly nice, and made sure that we had everything we needed and then some.  Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience, and a nice way to break up a busy morning of work.  I'd like to go back and try it when I have a little more free time, but the initial impression was healthy, fresh, and delicious, which is ideal for me as I'm trying for 1015 (fingers crossed) to eat a little more responsibly.  But at least it is close to work, so I can perhaps try them during one of my lunch breaks for a burger or sandwich.",

Living at The Ogden, I've walked by the empty storefronts on the ground floor for the last year and a half, longing for the day when they would begin to fill up with tenants. You are the first, and you get a point for blazing the downtown trail. You also get a point for NOT taking any assistance from Downtown Project's totalitarian neighborhood monopoly.  Unfortunately - at least on soft-opening day - the food just didn't add up. I haven't been to Rachels' other locations around the valley, but my wife and I ate here twice today for lunch and dinner and each time we were disappointed in the food's blandness and lack of freshness. Frozen fries, frozen onion rings, frozen breakfast potatoes and a general lack of flavor pervaded every dish we tried. I'm being brutally honest here with the hope that things improve, because DTLV desperately needs more restaurants and I desperately want to like this place.  My wife did try a peanut butter smoothie, which was very tasty, with complementary peanut butter and banana flavors. However, ultimately, we didn't have anything here that we couldn't make upstairs in our apartment.",

You order at the counter & they bring your food to your table.   Their menu is geared towards being healthy, I think. Lol. I opted for the albacore tuna salad sandwich on wheat bread with sweet potato fries! I wish they toasted the bread first but it was good! The fries were also tasty, very crispy, and I didn't feel as guilty eating them. Haha   So when the guy delivered my food to the table, he said that it didn't look like they gave me enough fries (& I agree, I know it's a healthy place but you should still give out an appropriate portion size) so he's going to ask them to make me a new batch. I thanked him & appreciated that he would do that. However, he never came back & gave me another order... I didn't ask for it since I thought that would be rude but anyways just wanted him to stick to his word. Lol",

Some of my favorites include: the protein lover's scramble, the grilled cheese and tomato soup, and the signature pasta. I'm a fan of the franchise overall. However, today I had my second less-than-pleasant experience at this location. I'm a big fan of the Centennial Hills location and that's the one I'm used to eating at. This location is rarely packed. Never \"Sunday after church\" packed, anyways. Yet both times I've visited I've been late back to work because of the long preparation and serving time. The first time was during breakfast and I waited almost 30 minutes just to be told that my order hadn't been started yet. The manager on duty fixed this by giving me a refund. I felt like that was a great way to handle it and so I left without writing a review. Today I tried to come in during lunch. Much slower this time, I waited about 30 minutes for my order that I had to ask for to-go because I was going to be going over my lunch time. And, you know that feeling when you don't want to be difficult because you've asked too many questions but they forget something? I had two meals, so I had asked for a couple condiments and the way the staff was acting made me feel like... maybe I should pay for the extra ranch? Anyway, long post short, I won't be returning to this location in the future strictly based on the the amount of time it takes to get my food.",

I ordered an egg white omelette with chicken, spinach, sun dried tomatoes. Paid extra for fruit on the side. The omelette was great!  I also ordered a grilled vegetable and chicken salad to go. All white meat for the chicken breast. The salad was huge and delicious. I love the roasted peppers laid out on top.   Shakes, salads, signature pasta, and wraps are all really good here!  Location is across from the D hotel. Parking on the side of the building that you have to pay for.  Definitely a great little franchise  for healthy food here in Las Vegas.

The Acai Berry smoothie was my drink of choice this bad boy is filled with Acai raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, pineapple, pineapple juice & nonfat vanilla frozen yogurt. This was my breakfast for the day and hit the spot, a great way to stay full and cool on the unusually warm April day.   The WiFi here is strong and didn't stop or get funky while I was working. I began my day here around 10am and didn't until about leave until 12:15pm, which by the way, is when this place gets packed. I think the entire Zappos Staff has lunch here.

    "text": "@RachelsKitchen_ A colorful place. Good food. It was recommended by a man who owns a parking lot nearby in the Fremont Street district.  The breakfast was standard for the price. No flavors were bold or stood out. The onion rings were big but scarce. They made the plate look large there were so few. Smoothie: Eh. Unimpressed. The ingredients looked fresh.   I had a great conversation with one of the delivery guys. He rides a bike toting meals. His tips go into the tip jar to be divided up with the rest of the staff. Bummer he rides all over in rain and heat and has to share his tips with the other employees who stand at the register in air conditioning.  There was no regular black iced tea. There were several teas including green tea. Not regular black tea.  I recommend giving this place a try. It offers an extensive menu, from breakfast to sandwiches, and is a different option dining experience for the area. It seemed a little forced and stuffy though. Visit for breakfast. You'll be glad you did. I was glad. Hunger is the best spice.",

It's not a place I'd recommend for a quick bite to eat, however. It's located on the bottom floor of a nice condo tower, right on the corner of Downtown Las Vegas and Bum Central. Don't be surprised to see a homeless person sleeping on their patio.  The environment inside is very clean, although a bit cluttered in the seating arrangement. It's more like communal dining at your own, separate table. Their bathrooms are always spotless, which is a clear indication that they value cleanliness. They even bus your tables for you (on a side note, I'd recommend using glassware for dine-in guests to save on waste. You're already bussing the tables and washing plates and flatware).  Back to the food. Huge menu done right. Again, I cannot stress how fresh everything always tastes. They cook everything to order, and the menu boasts some familiar foods with an upscale twist, without the upscale prices. Everything is very moderately priced considering the quality of the food, service, and atmosphere.  I'll make sure to come in and support this business when I come back as a tourist.  Thank you for the food, and the memories - this was the first place my partner and I went for breakfast together.   Get the 440, by the way. It's my favorite sandwich here.",

Whether you are at the Container Park or on Fremont, this is close to both!  We stopped in for lunch.  Luckily it wasn't too busy so the line moved quickly.  I ordered the smoked turkey and avocado sandwich with sweet potato fries.  Delicious! The sandwich was thick full of turkey. They certainly didn't skimp on fillings.  I probably should've stopped eating when I finished half but it was too good! The sweet potato fries were perfect.    There was a bit of a smell near one of the tables by the door.  Some of the tables weren't cleaned very well.  I'm hoping they can keep up with that a little better.    Otherwise Rachel's food is always good and wouldn't hesitate to stop back in!",

I stumbled across Rachel's Kitchen thankfully, because it is slightly obscured, from the  sidewalk and roadway, by planter boxes.  Inside the cafe has somewhat of a retro vibe, with a healthy breakfast and lunch menu.  I opted for the Protein Lovers Scramble and I was well pleased.  The food was quickly prepared and fresh.  The scramble incorporated eggs, diced grilled chicken, bacon, spinach, and was topped with cheddar cheese. It also came with a side of wheat toast and some very tasty potato squares.   The staff was very friendly and professional.  In fact the only thing keeping me from giving a 5 star rating is that two of the three coffee crafts were empty.  If you are looking for a light and healthy breakfast option to keep you going through the day, I would definitely refer you to Rachel's Kitchen.",

Its something that can definitely be made at home. my wife said that the chicken caesar was ok but nothing impressive either. It really makes me dissappointed because I feel like there aren't many good restaurants downtown yet that aren't located in a casino or for the ones that are great they have limited hours. This place also has limited hours.. it closes at 7pm on weekdays and 8pm on fridays and saturdays. overall not impressed.",

The service is always wonderful and you'll always get a smile whether you are in the restaurant or order delivery.  I ordered a Chicken Finger Wrap with onion rings and a Sweet Greens Juice.  Today's portion size was laughable.  There was more wrap than filling and only THREE onion rings.  THREE!!!    A coworker mirrored my order and also had only THREE onion rings in her meal as well.  She was also unhappy with her wrap.  This got us talking...most of us have noticed a decline in food quality and quantity from this location.  Very dissapointing.  We all love Rachel's and will continue to order for lunch but I hope this review is read and the concerns addressed.    We will give it a couple more tries but at this point there are too many other options to settle for an unsatisfactory lunch no matter how nice the employees are.",

So, when you decide whether to get only coffee or something else too, this is the perfect place to try. It's located in the beautiful Downtown of Las Vegas. Besides coffee, there are many different pastries and various entrees to choose from. After entering into the restaurant, you get in the line to the cashiers, where the drinks and meals can be ordered, and paid for. Afterward, the cashier gives you a number, what you place on your chosen table, where you will be served by waiters or waitresses. Pretty easy process! I visited Rachels twice last week, while I was doing business in the Area. Both times I ordered a Cappuccino (large) and Chocolate Cookie (warmed up), and my friend ordered a Grilled chicken  Salad.  According to my friend, the salad wasn't too bad, but unfortunately not very good either. I absolutely loved the cappuccino and the cookie!  I'm sure I will be back to try other items from the menu! And of course to enjoy the amazing coffee",

The Ultimate Grilled Cheese... was not very ultimate. Thin-sliced white bread, some cheese, a couple tomato slices. I expected thick crusty bread and really quality cheese... what I got was like, boring kid's menu grilled cheese. I could have made something way better for myself at home for wayyyy less than nearly $8.  The french fries and breakfast potatoes are not made fresh, they are frozen. The turkey on the turkey sandwich isn't a nice piece of turkey breast, it's boring lunch meat. They use a light hand to apply seasonings so there is not much flavor.  The service is really friendly, though. That and the smoothie I had are the reasons I am giving 3 stars instead of two- the peanut butter blast is delicious and the non-fat yogurt it's made with at least gives me the illusion of eating healthily. Since this location is literally right downstairs, I will probably stop by in the future to pick up a smoothie, but there is nothing on the menu that I couldn't make a tastier, fresher version of upstairs for way cheaper.",

We used to frequent the one in Summerlin since we lived there and have always loved the food...especially the breakfast.  Here is what to expect every time you go... 1. Look at menu and have a hard time deciding between the good options. 2. Order is always taken quickly. 3. Find a table and prepare to wait a little more than you think you have to because they are making things fresh in the back. Sometimes this wait gets aggravating. 4. Food comes to the table and you get to enjoy the goods.  That routine is pretty much how it goes every time. I recommend the breakfast burrito!",

After eating here I cannot imagine what they were talking about. The food was less than mediocre.   I had Rachel's chicken salad sandwich and sweet potato fries. The fries were cold. I mean very cold, like they had been sitting for 30 or 40 minutes cold. The sandwich should not be called chicken salad. There was barely any chicken. Basically you get diced apple pieces, sliced grapes and mayonnaise, with a tiny amount of chicken here or there. For $9.95 cold fries and fruit on stale bread. No thanks.   I do plan to go back. I want to give them a second chance just because everyone else seems to enjoy it. I think I'll try breakfast next time. Maybe it is served hot. Wish me luck.",

    "text": "I know I will get lynched for this, but I was very, very disappointed by this place. My number one issue? Premade veggie patties. Factory grade. For seven bucks? No. This place boasts healthy choices, but doesn't make its own veggie burger? I myself stay away from them because they are full of soy and sodium, and I hate, HATE seeing them on a menu anywhere. But whatever, they have other things here that look great.  So I got the Breakfast Ultimate Grilled Cheese. Most certainly not the most ultimate grilled cheese I have ever had. The bread was soaked in grease, and the cheese was not good. It had small tasteless tomatoes on it that didn't add to the flavor at all. The only thing I enjoyed off that plate was the potatoes.   I also got a Peanut Butter Blast smoothie that was pretty darn good, though not very peanutty, still very refreshing.  Perhaps I just order the wrong thing, but really as far as veggie alternatives, they are quite lacking. Maybe it is just this location, Downtown, but I was left baffled at this supposedly great healthy place.",

    "text": "Another convenient location!  This time, they moved into the bottom floor of the Ogden in downtown Las Vegas!!  My company is moving downtown in September and it's nice to know there's a Rachel's Kitchen around the corner.  On this visit, me and my work team came for a quick lunch before our quarterly company meeting.    I love the look of this restaurant.  No matter which location, you will be treated to a nice, clean bistro style restaurant.  This location has little round tables and high bar tops lining the front window.  The front counter is truly the star of the show, has a huge menu for your convenience and a viewing window for pastries.  The staff is friendly and very attentive.  You order, pay, grab your number and find a seat.  Your food will be brought to you when it's ready!  Super convenient :)  For lunch, I got the same gourmet sandwich I get in every visit:  The turkey club on wheat bread.  Smoked turkey, bacon, Swiss cheese, avocado, romaine lettuce, tomatoes and mayo served on three slices of your bread choice.  For me, what makes this sandwich is the avocado and mayo.  I love a sandwich with both.  It ties it all together and because of that, it's the best for me.  The turkey is nicely smoked, they give you a lot of slices and makes this sandwich super flavorful.  For my drink, I always get the Wilshire Smoothie.  It's filled with peaches, bananas, pineapples, fresh squeezed orange juice and nonfat vanilla frozen yogurt.  I always add kale to it for my serving of a super food.  Such a great smoothie, blended with all my favorites!!  Definitely a must try.    Overall, a great bistro place!  Remember, on Sundays, mimosas are only $3.  I hope my review has enticed you to visit.  If you're looking for clean food with great service, come check them out.  You will not be disappointed!",

I'm loving this since it is really close to my place.  Today I stopped in for a quick lunch and had the Turkey burger and sweet potato fries and a Vanilla latte. The food was great and so was the service from the cashier and food runner. The vanilla latte was top notch...well done ladies!  One thing I pay VERY close attention to is cleanliness. The owner/manager (not sure exactly who she is) was constantly walking around organizing tables/chairs and cleaning the tables AND chairs. I love that, please keep it up, nothing worse than having to \"bus\" my own table and brush crumbs off the seat!  The restroom requires a key to access since this location is downtown and it shows they care about cleanliness in this department too; the restroom was immaculate and fully stocked with soap and paper towels.  I can't find any reason to rate this location anything but 5 stars...believe me I tried, even peaking into the kitchen ;-)  Thanks for opening up a location downtown and maintaining the consistency I've come to expect from the other locations!",

For example, the mushroom burger apparently comes on multigrain bread, whereas one might expect it to be on brioche at most restaurants. I understand that there is maybe a health-bent to it (and hey, I'm from Santa Monica, so all the more power to that!), but I certainly never got the impression that I should expect it to come out like that. The breakfast omelette too came out, well, just fine.   Again, it's not something that I'd consider that terrible, but I just definitely think you have other options available, being that Vegas is Vegas and all. So why not go to those places?  GOOD: healthy?, free wifi, clean bathroom OKAY: almost all of it BAD: umm...odd bread choice?",

Fired up the Yelp machine, and boom! Rachel's Kitchen pops up.  I wanted something delicious and healthy, but also was looking for some fresh juicing, as I needed to get some potassium to remedy some serious beveraging from the night before.  Imagine my surprise when it was a very short walk down the street.  Walked in, I was maybe the only person there around 8am on a Thursday.  Opted for the fresh watermelon juice and the protein lover's scramble.  I didn't see a mention of gluten-free bread or other on the menu so I told the cashier to leave the bread off.  She mentioned that they do, in fact, have GF bread, so that was nice.  The food took a bit to prepare, assuming as it's all made fresh to order.   The scramble and potatoes were very tasty and the two slices of bread were standard GF.  I was not impressed with the watermelon \"juice\" - as it ended up being more watermelon-mash, and after the juice was gone, I had about 1/4 cup full of pulp - similar to when you get to the bottom of a slurpee and you have some thick slurpee-ice at the bottom.  I have had cold-pressed watermelon juice or even just juiced watermelon and was expecting less solid matter in my cup.  Prices were average or a bit higher, and I did enjoy the quality of food and the location - I ended up visiting twice more before I left town.    Second visit - felt it took a longer than normal time to churn out a grilled chicken salad, but it was pretty dang good so I'll let it go.  Third visit - got the same thing as visit #1, only this time I got one slice of bread, which I didn't notice until I got back to the hotel.  Suggestions: -Put your GF offerings on the menu, or state \"GF toast available\" or something -More juice, less junk -Unlike the juices, Rachel's needs more consistency in product served.",

Best option in the neighborhood where most restaurants offer you large but very greasy and in unappetizing plates. We had a great fresh juice and other healthy options. Nice clean quiet atmosphere and friendly staff. It's located just barely of the beaten path. Highly recommend this place",

The portions was big and the taste was pretty good. I had a side of fruit with my sandwich which is a great way to end my meal. I'd come back to try their other sandwiches. The restaurant was clean and not very big. The only feed back I have is I feel that the tables and seats are too close to each other, so you're kind of like elbow to elbow with others.",

Literally nothing. She told me she wasn't new so idk what the issue was. I felt bad for the girl. I asked the other girl at the front if they had Mr. Pibb and she said yes so I bought my drink and they literally had no trace of Mr. Pibb in the restaurant. The portion sizes are small my 6 year old cousin was still hungry after her breakfast burrito meal. The pastries were hard as though they were Fisher Price kitchen play food. A rip off for the price. To say the least this this restaurant needs to get it together. I feel sad for them.",

Even though we were on vacation wanted to not eat junk every day. So Glad we decided to go there.  Got the grilled veggie sandwich and sweet potato fries. sandwich was huge and tasted great. the fries were cold  since my plate was sitting up there awhile .  THere was only 1 worker and had many customers to take care of and make drinks and take out orders.  Any way  loved my meal it was so big took it back to hotel and had it for lunch next day . My friend got the cobb salad and loved it said was best ever had and still talking about it.  SO now we are glad to found a new place in downtown LV to eat now.",

I ordered the tuna salad, a cup of coffee, and my bf had the salad with the grilled chicken.   Our salads were YUGE and insanely delicious. The would have been much more pricey in NYC. Definitely one of the better meals out here during our trip! The place has a complete downtown/financial district lunch vibe, but wasn't too insane when we went.

    "text": "Came here on Friday afternoon with some coworkers.  Four us ordered separately but right after one another.  One person got their food almost immediately upon sitting down but was halfway done with the second person received their ordered.  By the time the third person received their order I got up to check on mine as I was still waiting.  It should be noted that I ordered the same menu item as the second person to receive their order.  As I got to the counter to check mine came out FINALLY!  A fifth person joined us late into the lunch but ordered while I was still waiting for my item.  There's came out shortly after mine.  It makes zero sense!   Ironically, this visit was almost three years to the date of my last visit and the experience was almost identical minus the fact that they were no where near crowded, there were no lines, and plenty of seating.  I like Rachel's food but if you want to eat as a group this is not a place I would risk going to for lunch.  Even though we ordered separately, we were all in line together, and at the time our group was the only ones placing orders.  Maybe this spot is a win for takeout but I won't be returning for takeout or otherwise unless this is a coworker choice, in which case I will probably decline the offer.",

I am definitely an independent girl and can have a meal solo so downtown spots are perfect for that. I decided to give Rachel's Kitchen a whirl since I often went to the one in The District in Green Valley. Unfortunately The District got turned into The ROAD o CARS so I have been avoiding that area. I realize Downtown is no different, but The District *used* to have charm... not so much anymore.  Anyway, enough of my ranting - I like the fact this RK is Downtown. I like that it is in The Ogden, what I don't like is me driving past it twice looking for a place to park! *shakes fist* Well, I ended up metering, but I have gotten over that hump of going Downtown. So I meter. I don't care, pretty much every major city EXCEPT Las Vegas has meters everywhere for parking so I have come to terms.  This RK is set up quite the same as the one in The District with the great looking green-tiled tables and the nice snuggly cafe vibe. The employees were very sweet when I was here and offered honey/lemons for my tea and answered my questions regarding the soup of the day.  I really was hankering for soup/sandwich combo which RK has for $9.75. I say that's a decent price especially since you get a bowl of soup, not a cup.   Turkey/Bacon/Avocado Sandwich (on sourdough) & Potato Cheddar Soup - The soup startled me because when it came out it was bright orange. I was like, \"What is this trickery potato soup?\" But, as I spooned the deliciously pureed potato and cheese into my mouth I decided it was quite delicious. I am sure the orange hue comes from copious amount of cheddar cheese, so ya know, fat girl status up in here! As for the sandwich it was a bit of a let-down. The bread was dry dry dry and did not have the richness I was expecting from a nice sourdough. I have a suspicion it was day(s) old bread. And there was an extra piece of bread in it which I didn't care for and removed. The turkey was all right and in my wold avocados make anything better, so it saved the sandwich a bit but not much.  Peach & Ginger Black Tea - I would come back for their teas to be honest. Sitting downtown sipping this amazing tea they have would be perfect on any winter day. I can't remember the name of the teas but the next time I go back I am writing it down in case I can get it for my own enjoyment at home.  Overall - Food-wise could use a little work. I hope when I go back the next thing I order completely redeems the dry bread. Ambiance, service, and overall experience was positive. Four stars it is for now.",

It's what I order every time anyhow.  My kids love the banana chocolate pancakes and Mac and cheese.  The juices are amazing!  I could go on and on!  The service is always top notch!  Just today, we came in and the kids were greeted with coloring paper and crayons while I ordered our meal. We are always greeted with a smiling face and they are always so patient with us when we are indecisive.  Our meals are always consistent!  Always great!    We love this location and all the charm of the area.   Thanks for our amazing lunch today and all our other amazing meals in the past, from breakfast to lunch, and happy hour to dinner. :)",

Whether you had a rough night, or a completely awesome night, you need to come to this place to get some of the best, healthiest, yum food stuff around Fremont Street. There's really not much to choose from in this area - gross casino buffets, taco stands, pizza, or the ridiculous restaurant where you eat for free if you are morbidly obese. If you happen to like food outside of these categories, you MUST try this place. I was greeted by two women who I assume own the place, and was almost thrown off by how nice they were. They were literally so accommodating and knew everything about every item on the menu. They served my friends and I all with a smile, and that was something I did not expect. The food took a little bit longer than they expected, so they gave us free cookies! The food: SO GOOD. Everything was fresh, well prepared, and looked great on the plate.",

The portion of fries was almost smaller than the unasked for dish of ketchup served on sandwich place (ripoff in the name of design?) and chicken sandwich interesting but kind of a mess. Weak coffee and though it's not hugely expensive it seems like a place where packaging trumps substance. Should have went back to Cracked Egg- a drive from here and low key but wonderful real food that satisfies. Far different than this place.   Not to pack it on but It seems a wasted meal given so many other choices. The sour dough tasted like white bread, the goat cheese like cream cheese and... I won't go on. Back to the Cracked Egg tomorrow.",

Staff are friendly and the food is decently priced. They have yummy fresh pressed juices available too which are perfect for your typical hot Vegas day.  Rachel's was walking distance from our hotel in the general Fremont Street Experience area. We were pleased with our experience here and I recommend it to anyone looking for a fresh bite for brunch. They're open for brekkie and lunch hours. Parking shouldn't be an issue, but we walked so I admit we weren't paying attention to that. There are garages and street spaces nearby though.",

This can get pretty busy especially at lunch.   If you're visiting it's pretty close to a few casinos. It doesn't seem to get a ton of tourists even though it's close. This is because most tourists are stuffing themselves on burgers and pizza. It has a good amount of juices. The juices are about $7 or so. It's all organic so it's definitely worth more than regular juice. The food menu shouldn't be overlooked. It has a few vegetarian items. There's not as many as you think. What they have is good though. I like the one salad. This is about $10 so it's a bit much for this.   Overall it's one of the healthier places you can eat around here. Vegas is known for buffets and shit. The prices suck on some things.",

They have so many options for me. Never noticed it before. Staff was friendly like always, and place was so clean, as always lol. This place has it going, great food, friendly staff and a huge menu. You can always find something here.  I got the fresh juice with cucumber apple and pineapple. Man was it crisp and refreshing. Great flavor. Then for my breakfast I had a burrito wrap. I was only disappointed in two things. I asked for some of my egg on the burrito to be over easy so the egg would run all over the burrito. The cooked it over hard. I also asked if they could not cut it because it's easier for me to eat that way, but they did cut it \"/ the server noticed and asked to remake it but you could tell they didn't wana re make it and kinda hoped I would eat it that way. If your running food and you notice a problem you go back and fix it before it hits the table. Even though it wasn't my IDEAL burrito, it did taste good. Otherwise a very happy customer :)  Yelp check in: free muffin :) Got a carrot raisin muffin, very good!",

    "text": "This place had benefited from having a somewhat normal menu in a very hipster/trying to hard area of town.   Prices are absurd, being it's the only place I know of to get a protein shake downtown, I have been known to grab one here every now and then. Things is, I get your standard banana/peanut butter protein shake and it's $8 bucks here when it's $5 at any other smoothie shop on earth. Needless to say, I've stop coming in.  I live downtown and I'm all for supporting local establishments, but when I go to a restaurant and ask an employee questions about menu item, I expect an answer, not, \"hold on, let me ask\". I hate that. Why don't you know your own menu, you only work there?   I've had the turkey burger here, it was very forgettable, I've had an egg wrap here, it was even more forgettable. My wife has had the pancakes, i think she kinda liked it, but the other time we went together, she got the \"veggie burger\" or \"garden burger\" or whatever they call it and the patty was full of cheese tho the menu made zero attempt to make you aware of this. She ordered it without cheese. If you worked there would that raise a flag that this person doesn't want any cheese? And then wouldn't you want to make your customer who is paying $10+ dollar for a shitty meatless burger aware of the cheese riddled patty? The answer is no. Also if you worked there, you wouldn't have known about the cheese in the patty, cause no one that works there knows anything.   They received an extra star for serving coke products, so keep in mind this is actually a one star review that got a much needed but undeserving boost.",

This is a great spot for a healthier, low-key breakfast if you're staying downtown.   It's counter service, but they bring your food to your table, so a win-win in my opinion. The wraps are so big they must have like 5 eggs in them, and come with the most delicious side of little fried breakfast potatoes. And multi-grain banana chocolate chip pancakes with fruit for $8?! It's a steal! Pancakes are rich, moist and full of toppings.  Smoothie and juice bar is a wonderful addition if you're looking to do a lighter option. They also have a selection of baked goods that I'm always too full for but look delicious!  Wonderful place and I look forward to coming back.",

They are always courteous and the food and service is amazingly consistent.  The two owners, Caron and Cathy also make a point to come over to my table every time to say Hi and ask how the food tastes.  They do this for nearly everyone but they always make a point to welcome their regular customers.    Here's a parking hint for the newbies to downtown Vegas dining: There are always free on-street parking spots available on Stewart Ave. which is just a half a block north and east of the Strip.",

    "text": "Rachel's Kitchen at the Ogden offers both a serene and kinetic welcome upon every visit. The calming celadon green and clear-blue-sky mosaic tiles complement the staff's eager-to-please, warm smiles. A range of spaces to yield the day while enjoying flavor-packed delights invite guests to make their first choices: a length of firm, rich wood bar-and-stool seatings looking out onto the hustle and bustle of Las Vegas Boulevard; a softly padded, energetically colored banquet; a common area of four tops; or a strip of quiet two tops along the cozy galley-like hallway where local artists' works are featured.  Beside including such a perfectly curated range of atmospheres, the menu is tolerant of cheat days, supportive on \"I'm being healthy today\" days, and satiates the need during comfort food days. Beyond that perk, the fare at Rachel's Kitchen is consistent. The shoestring-type french fries are always salted to perfection and never greasy. The breakfast potatoes always have just a little crisp around the edges with a soft, not starchy or grainy, inside. The burgers are always cooked just right, and strangely, having a burger at Rachel's Kitchen doesn't seem like such a guilty pleasure as it sometimes does elsewhere.   Goat cheese, eggplant, zucchini, roasted red peppers, yellow squash, red onions, roasted tomatoes, apples, grapes, and strawberries are common, but so are mayo, bacon, and cheese. Rachel's is the kind of place that doesn't make diners feel ashamed about the mayo, bacon or cheese, and to top it off, there are gluten-free options available -- and they aren't marketed as a \"trend diet\" but genuinely geared towards those who are truly intolerant of the ubiquitous and sometimes troublemaking protein. Perhaps it is the osmosis of healthy options that abound on the monstrous menu that makes that second decision, what to eat, so difficult.   There are 15 smoothies and fresh juices available, and for the kale lovers there are several to choose from. Patrons are welcome to create their own too! The salads are fresh tasting with ingredients among the highest achievers in nutritional value.  Among comfort foods like homemade granola (roasted and toasted in their own kitchen for a perfect crunch and served with yogurt or milk, with optional strawberries and bananas) and oatmeal with strawberries and banana, there are some signature dishes such as the signature salad (nut crusted goat cheese, mixed baby greens, tomatoes, cucumbers and radishes tossed with our balsamic basil vinaigrette available with either chicken or tuna).   The portions are a solid size, but I never feel guilty about cleaning my plate. The breakfast wrap (scrambled eggs, bacon, tomato, cheddar cheese in a whole wheat tortilla) is fantastic and probably enough for two people to split. Breakfast is served all day at Rachel's Kitchen, so late risers or breakfast-for-breakfast-lunch-and-dinner, can't-get-enough types can bask in breakfast glory all day long.  If pasta fills the bill, the Bolognese is served with angel hair (a unique choice according to my Bolognese-loving compatriots), but neither does this dish go unfinished despite pasta being one of those kinds of foods that can be eaten and just never seem to disappear. My fellow diner asked for a slice of bread to scrape the plate clean because the sauce is just too tasty to waste. It was that or he would become uncivilized (and a public spectacle) by licking the bowl.   An additional perk to Rachel's Kitchen is that all the dishes served make things easy and versatile according to time of day and purpose. Diners can eat and run but won't be sorry to sit and chillax. It's simple and delicious: perfect for fast-paced patrons who like to get in and get out, but also relaxed enough to hang around and have a few glasses of wine, beer, or champagne and mimosas.  The one thing that never varies is that there are always friends at Rachel's Kitchen, no matter what time of day one chooses to stop in, and if live music is an appealing addition to yummy food and good friends in a comforting environment, the Thursday Night Jam is a rotating schedule of local musical guests. Last time I was there two players did White Winter Hymnal by Fleet Foxes; this was as shocking as it was groovy and the perfect icing on the freshly baked Valentine's Day sugar cookies we enjoyed. It's the warm kind of feeling that permeates the place once a glass of wine and humorous conversation take over the mood.   No matter breakfast, lunch or dinner, Rachel's Kitchen at the Ogden offers a homey and friendly place to match your pace, and the community involvement of Kathy Wilson and Caron Richardson is evidence of their commitment to building a space the likes of which have been seen in such television sitcoms as Seinfeld and Friends. No longer only on TV, Monk's Cafe and the Central Perk are right here under our noses, only it's called lovingly by locals as just plainly \"Rachel's.\"",

My issue is with the morning counter help. Organization doesn't seem to be their first priority. I generally order a smoothie and one other item.... most recently I waited 10 minutes for the smoothie and I was the only one in the place!  On a recent visit I witnessed three business men slowly loose their cool while waiting for their food to be brought out and when it was it was incorrect.   Being from NYC and a huge fan of Juice Generation I am use to the productivity they provide....service the customer and next. Rachel's, though customer friendly, is not up to speed.   I frequent another juice bar in NYC and the one thing they do if take all the ingredients and put them into a large metal bowl.. walk over to the juicer and drop them all in one by one..... At Rachel's I have watched the counter person walk from the counter to the juicer for each ingredient!  Give them a try they are worth it but don't expect a quick turn around.",

And I love the addition of fresh mushrooms and onions).    The service is the epitome of \"service with a smile.\"  The staff already knows me by name, which is such a nice treat.  And lunch time service has been quick and efficient, even during the lunch rush time.  I am thrilled that Rachel's Kitchen is downtown.  I'm definitely excited to work my way through the menu and try all that they have to offer.

Ever since my first visit, I've seriously contemplated ditching my usual haunts from Manhattan.  I was at nearby Makers & Finders Coffee earlier in the day, but unfortunately, I was having difficulties with their wifi and actually really needed Internet access. After staying there for a couple hours, I decided to look for a new coffee shop in the area. Good ol' Yelp suggested Rachel's to me. Thank you, Yelp!  The shop is easy to miss if you're not paying attention, but once you step inside, you'll feel welcomed by the  decorations, and all of staff were very nice to me, i bother  this guy with a lot of requests and he always was very nice to me.  I stayed for a couple hours and didn't have any problems with the wifi. Plus, I loved the music that they played. As for food and drink, I got an iced coffee and a turkey  sandwich. The coffee was decent, but not the best that I've had. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the sandwich. All the ingredients were fresh, and they weren't skimpy with the fixings.  Looking forward to trying more of their food and sticking around!",

    "text": "Sadly disappointing: bland food, high prices, long wait and minimal service.  I walked in at 10am on a Saturday to an otherwise empty restaurant (sign?) and asked if the pastries were vegan. The waiter did know, had to ask the chef who also wasn't sure so they said they probably weren't. Then I asked if any of the smoothies could be made non-dairy and he said yes, some. After I asked about 2 possible options he seemed to remember there was an alternative vegan menu (with a handful of potential options) he could show me.  I eventually ordered the steel cut oatmeal ($5) with added strawberries and bananas ($2.25). I waited about 10 minutes for my oatmeal. My to go bag had everything I could need; unfortunately the food was not worth the wait or the price.  The oatmeal was watery and bland (even for my taste). There was 1 sliced strawberry and about half a banana sliced on top - that's it. The fruit was so flavorless I'm guessing it was frozen and thawed in the oatmeal.  I wouldn't recommend for vegans, maybe the eggs and bacon are better.",

Everything seemed fresh and they had lots of healthy options.  I opted for \"the favorite\" omelette and Justin got the BLT sandwich with egg and fries.  The omelette was awesome- I loved the mixture of sundried tomatoes, avocado, goat cheese and shrooms! The homefries were lacking- they seemed to be the store bought kind. Justin enjoyed his BLT also!  We also ordered the berry smoothie.  It was made with frozen yogurt instead of soy milk which made it creamy and frozen!  I also had an iced coffee with soy milk but it wasn't the best.... Too much soy milk and the coffee had grounds in it that settled to the bottom.  They currently have an awesome yelp deal for half off any alcohol. Woohoo! Great way to attract customers! Unfortunately, we had to road trip afterwards so no mimosa with my brunch!  I was glad we came in before the lunch rush- this place seemed like the place to be!  Definitely worth trying out for fresh food worth the prices!",

    "text": "I can sum up my experience today as \"A catastrophe of errors.\"  Walked in on a Saturday at 1pm. Three people besides myself inside the restaurant. Three employees behind the counter. I walked up to the register. I was not acknowledged or even looked at. One employee was on the phone and the other two were talking to each other with their backs to me. A minute passed and nothing. At that moment I should have realized it was going to be a bad experience.   One employee eventually comes to the register and doesn't say \"hi\" or \"sorry for the wait\", but just says, \"for here?\"  (The one on the phone still feet away never acknowledging me).    I ordered at 1:04pm. I ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich. I sat down. At 1:28 no food or service telling me they made an error. In that time several employees from the kitchen go behind the counter and talk relaxed to each other. Working is an afterthought to all of them. I go to the front counter and ask to speak to a manager because I have yet to get my food. An employee goes to the back and never returns. Another employee standing there eventually comes up and says, \"I am in charge right now, what's wrong.\" I said I want to get refunded and want to speak to an owner. She goes to the phone. Talks on it for two minutes and then hangs up. Then proceeds to go back to work and not acknowledge me again. I confront her and say, \"where is the manager.\" She said, \"he is not here and will be here in 15 minutes. You can wait for him.\"   The audacity for her to suggest that I could wait after I waited 30 minutes for a grilled cheese that was never made. I walked out. I doubt I will ever return.   I had stopped going there as often due to two previous health violations from the SNHD and poor customer service. Today solidified my desire to not return and make sure people know they have work to do.",

I have had their salads before as well, and although super fresh, they were nothing special.. especially for the price. I felt as if they were skimpy on the ingredients. They'll give you a large container but barely any lettuce/toppings. So I thought I would try a wrap and see if things were any different.  Today I tried the  Caesar wrap. On the menu it is a chicken Caesar wrap, so I asked for it with no chicken, not a problem they said.   My order was over $11!! For a Caesar salad wrap!! It was the same price as it would be if it had chicken in it! This is not a standard practice in the food industry and i would never pay this price for a simply Caesar salad wrap.   The wrap was completely soaked in dressing that it was dripping and the wrap was beginning to get soggy. I still ate it because I was hungry and needed to get back to work, but I would never order food from here again. I'll stick to my morning smoothie.",

Since we had been driving all day, the nice lady behind the counter recommended a couple of 1 oz. wheat grass shots to give us more energy for the rest of our journey. She took great care to run the wheat grass through the juicer a few times to be sure she got every drop of juice out! I've had wheatgrass before but I don't remember it being this sweet. I don't know where they source theirs from but it was probably the best I've had.   We also got a couple of their fresh juices. One with a green base of kale, spinach, cucumbers and ginger. The other had a beet base with ginger and other fruits. They were both really good and refreshing. Even my kids liked them.

Orders were taken with a smile and served with another smile. My friend and I both ordered sandwiches with sides of fries. I ordered a pressed green drink. Food was right on with what I've had at the other locations. I like that- consistency- I know what to expect from a Rachel's Kitchen and that means something to me as a customer. I will definitely keep this location in mind next time I'm exploring downtown.",

I walked in here today and ordered a side of crispy bacon and the French toast.  I was so pleased that I stopped and spoke with the front end service people and the cook after eating.  I thanked them for serving the best food ever.  Today my mother passed away and is now with God in Heaven.  I am so sure these folks will continue a tradition of serving the best food just like MOM. Thank you mom for looking down on us today to remembering what good food is for.  Thanks Kevin",

All the ingredients were here for a good meal, except it seemed like my food had been sitting there for quite awhile. I was with a group of 4 and the 2 that had breakfast wraps or burritos tough their food was delicious, but the two of us that had eggs thought they were dry and the cheese on top had formed that hard layer from sitting. When we walked in we had to wait about 5 minutes to place our order due to the fact that that there was only 1 person working at the register and they were putting in a giant delivery order. Our food then took awhile to get to us which I'm guessing had something to do with that. I'd be willing to try it again and guess it might be better, but this time it was just average.",

    "text": "I ended up going to Rachel's for lunch because there are not many healthy options in the areas near the strip.   The parking situation here is a pain and even though there is a spot to use a credit card, the parking machine only takes cash and coins.   I sampled the tuna and curried chicken salad before deciding what to order. The tuna had an excess amount of mayonnaise and the chicken was dry. I looked at the menu for an additional five minutes because I did not know what to order and was skeptical because I did not think the food was up to par based on the samples. I decided on the chicken sandwich on the light menu and my friend chose the tuna even though she tried it as well and was not impressed.  The sandwich I had was poorly stacked and because the lettuce was placed on the bottom it became wilted. I did not enjoy the seasoning of the chicken which is all I could taste when eating my sandwich. My friend said her tuna was overly watery which made the tortilla soggy. She also thought there was too much tuna and additional ingredients were needed in order to combat the mushiness of the tuna.  Both times I have been to Rachel's I have found the food to be average and lazily made.",

The other items are amazing too!  If you are in the mood for some comfort food, try the Mac n Cheese. So good!!!  If you are interested in healthy food and a cool vibe, check it out.

Their fresh juices are to die for, salads are stellar, burgers are awesome, pasta is killer, no paninis unfortunately, only cold sandwiches. Why the 3 stars - just found out that their meat ingredients are generic store quality and NOT antibiotic/ hormone/ GMO free which should be the standard at healthy place to eat. Who knows what's in the meat or even veggies, scary thought, wonder why I didn't think of it sooner, just assumed they were using the best ingredients NOT.

I had 2 bites of my so called crapy cheese hamburger, my husband had a crapy turkey sandwich and we shared a salad.  (In fact I'm in shock by looks and quality of the food all around- it's terrible). What a joke and Rachael you should be embarrassed. You need to put more into the quality and taste of your food or your going down.  There was nothing right about what I got on my plate. What kind of fries are those ?!?!?- skinny little pre frozen shoestring fries that tasted like filmy grease and had a stale texture.  ( get rid of that pre frozen crap- fries have been around for what seems like forever - how hArd is it- it's freakin French fries- it's an American must know how to for any cafe that serves sandwiches/burgers - HELLO!!!). I felt like a child forcing myself to eat this crap (my punishment was that I spent way too much money here and I was regretting every second of it- I really wanted to cry- I really wanted my money back!!). I don't care how great your service is (which it was and seems to be what might be keeping them alive). but I came here to eat and eat really great food. The food should be at the very least, good. The food there was is just plain unacceptable.  The place is only capable of making salads. If that and That's it! Everything else should just be removed off the menu. And I wouldn't even count on them to make a great salad or be consistent  about it either. As it was not that good. What a big let down -better off going to Subway, McDonald's or Denny's. I'm telling you- this place SUCKS!!!! Low quality, blah, blah, blah, flavorless, and boring food. Not sure why they offer a rewards card - how silly!?!?! Only people who go back there are the employees.",

I will be back often for the Signature Pasta or whatever I am craving. I highly recommend you try it out.",
