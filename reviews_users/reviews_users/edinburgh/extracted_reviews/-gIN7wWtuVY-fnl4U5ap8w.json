The chicken tikka fries... after years of gross gravy poutine .. why didn't anyone think about this before??!?!? Ok so the downside is atmosphere is a tad cold... but service was outstanding... and the churros super yum yum",

One poor lad running around doing my everything while two female members of staff just stood at the desk doing paperwork during main lunch time.",

    "text": "Don't go!!  I'll give our waitress a break because she was new but even with the help of the other more experienced waitress the service was appalling. Our food came quickly but before the drinks we ordered and even before the water. We ordered numerous dishes but they were out of about 1/3 of what we wanted. They were even out of pineapple juice for 2 of the drinks we ordered.  Two of our small plates didn't come with the rest of our food.  One of the items never made it on our order (Krispy Fried Chicken Sliders) so we reordered it because the sauce on the Coogate Burger had an odd mixed up flavor. When the chicken sliders finally arrived they were full of grizzle and fat. Most everything else was lacking in taste in one way or another. Plus, their idea of \"fusion\" is to pour tikka masala on top of French fries!  And as if that's wasn't enough the poor waitress couldn't figure out how to run the credit card machine so that we could pay the ridiculous bill of over 100!!  Save yourself the bad experience.",
