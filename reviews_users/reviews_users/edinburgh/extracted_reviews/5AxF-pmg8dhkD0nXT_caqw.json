    "text": "I booked here to stay overnight while in Edinburgh through <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbooking.com&s=c178a46bcdd8acf675af1d0cc8c8d35ab72dc1a82c627540cafb59919d30f279\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">booking.com</a> as the hotel was right in the area I needed to be. I arrived in the afternoon and was really impressed with the location - a nice quiet street off Leith Walk with parking right out the front. The hotel itself is really nice, a traditional Scottish hotel with the boutique vibes you'd expect.   My room (#3) was downstairs but had a lot of light as it looked over the garden. The room was really big, a large King size bed and a lovely bathroom. The only thing that I could really see that was missing was a mini bar but they do have a bar upstairs. The room even had a couch and two desks and a decent wardrobe.   I got a good night's sleep but the bed was two singles pushed together so it kind of dipped in the middle. That's really the only reason that I'm docking a star, otherwise it was all really nice.   Breakfast in the morning was decent - 10 for a full Scottish breakfast, juice and coffee/tea. The room rate was reasonable, 115 and I'd definitely stay here again.",

    "text": "No 11 Boutique Hotel is amazing, I will definitely return and strongly recommend it. I stayed in their spacious Georgian Suite for two nights and thought it extremely comfortable and beautiful. Windows overlooking a private, green back garden, four poster bed, free standing bath, double wash hand basins and fluffy bathrobes. I'm delighted I found this quiet, small haven. There was a full table service breakfast each morning (the vegetarian cooked breakfast and porridge being particularly good). Staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. I had a marvellous time here - love this place.",

    "text": "Went there with the Amazon coupon. The food was great, absolutely delicious. With Amazon coupon it's definitely worth to go for 16 pounds per person a 3 course dinner. However the coupon offers 3 course menu with tea and truffles and we never saw the truffles. They brought us the tea we asked but they didn't brought them and we forgot to ask about them so perhaps it's was also a bit of our mistake for not asking but they should have offered them. I am not giving 5 stars because perhaps for the full price the meal is quite expensive, but then again I live by student budget.   The place is really nice but in the small side. Me and my friend are 23 and 24 and so we find the ambience a bit too grown up. I think every single costumer apart from us was above 60. So if you don't mind that and you are just there to have a chat with your friend and an excellent meal I recommend it, but if you want a place with more vibe maybe it's not for you.",
