Once inside, however, I couldn't help but buy a Bounty Bar traybake and some of the fabulous soup: today's offering was some lovely thai green curry chicken noodle soup, and it was delightful. I went home with a toasted roll as well, due to the owner's sweet generosity (they were closing soon and sent me home with a roll to try!). Not only was the food delicious and surprisingly inexpensive, the owner and her darling daughter were a delight. They got wind of the fact that I'd not been able to find a Highland dance class in the area on my brief visit and went so far as to make a few calls for me, to work something out! I couldn't believe the generous spirit, kindness, and down-to-earth goodness of both ladies. Thank you for everything and I wish you all the best! Anyone reading: go as quick as you can to the Little Fox Deli, I am certain you will be just as charmed as I was!",
