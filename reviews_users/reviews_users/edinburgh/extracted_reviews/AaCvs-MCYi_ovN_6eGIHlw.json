    "text": "What an adorable gem of a place this is. After some futile hunting around for a restaurant, we spotted this place down a wee side street off the Kings Theatre. Got to admit, we didn't go in with high expectations, but goes to show how poor my judgement is!  We shared some vegetable spring rolls to start, then SR had a Pad Prik Kink (with chicken) and I opted for Pla Rad Prik Monkfish, and shared some steamed rice and fried noodles. I will note that the noodles didn't work with the monkfish - steamed rice much better. THe SR loved his chicken, but had major food envy for my prettily arranged asparagus and monkfish. the fish, in a light batter, had a fantastic sauce - intensely sweet, intensely sour, intensely spicy. It was an intoxicating combination, tempered with the blandness of steamed rice.   Prices were reasonable, the staff pleasant enough, it was BYOB but we didn't care and we were delighted, absolutely. A hidden gem, indeed.",

    "text": "It's a pity that this restaurant is hidden off the beaten track, because the food here is very tasty and the service is very good.  I have only been to three Thai restaurants but this is by far the best one I have been to and the food has been consistently good on the four times I have been there. I have found a firm favourite dish in the red curry, which always tastes delicious. The restaurant provides good value for money with the servings you get and also offers BYOB, which is an added bonus on the wallet. The decor of the restaurant is pretty simple but this shouldn't take anything away from the fact that this is a hidden gem in Edinburgh.",

Maybe a little lacking in atmosphere, but service is very polite and friendly and food tasty.   They didn't have a licence to sell alcohol when I last went, but you can bring your own and pay a little corkage - a large scotmid at the end of the street means its pretty easy to grab some up locally if you forget!   Definitely give it a try, especially good if you're on a tight budget.",
