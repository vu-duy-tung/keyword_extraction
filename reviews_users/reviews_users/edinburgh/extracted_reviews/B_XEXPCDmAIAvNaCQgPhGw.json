This was our 2nd attempt to visit as when we visited the 1st time it was closed.   The inside of the bakery was very retro which i loved and the display case had 10 different cakes to chose from!!   There are little lables attached to each cake as some are also vegan and nut free.   I chose the ginger cake and my bf had the mint choc brownie. Both were huge slabs of cake for 2.50. They really dont scrimp on portion sizes. My ginger cake was amazing if slightly on the sweet side. I sampled the bf's brownie and it was really nice.  I brought home some cupcakes and also a pizza scone to try.   There are 6 bar stools to use if you want to sit in but unfortunately they dont have any soft drinks which is what stopped this from being a given a 5 star review.  Will definitely be back when visiting Edinburgh!",

    "text": "So, first day of opening, I headed to Sugar Daddy's. It is a completely gluten free bakery and they can also cater for other free from which is going to give them brownie points from me.  The bakery is based on Rodney St, other side from the Marshmallow Lady. They have some seats inside (about 6 perhaps) so you can sit in and grab cake and coffee. The seating area was full when I visited and I wanted cake to take away.  They had some cookies (60p each), brownies (2.20 - 2.50 each) and a couple of cupcakes including red velvet (2.50). I grabbed a white chocolate blondie and a red velvet to go.   I was surprised at so many brownies available (normal, peanut butter, salted caramel, etc) as many gf people have brownie fatigue as thats traditionally the only cake we'd be offered.   Service was friendly and helpful. There is a loyalty card - collect the stamps and after six, get a freebie.   So, the taste test. I tried a bit of the blondie as I was wandering to Stockbridge. Very sweet, and I'm a sugar junkie so I was glad I only had a couple of little bites as I think the full thing would be too much.  I was saving myself for the red velvet cupcake. It was disappointing which I hate to say as I love that places like this are popping up and catering to gf. I could see the top of the cupcake was cracked so I thought this might mean it was overbaked and it was :-( In the interests of research, I ate it all but it was consistently a bit hard throughout. I did like the icing, really good and not fake sweet like Bibi's had ended up.  So, 3 stars. I wasn't wowed but I'd return once the hype has died down to see if the cupcakes are better.",
