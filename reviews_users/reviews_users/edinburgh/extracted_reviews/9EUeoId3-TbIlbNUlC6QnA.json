    "text": "The Gold Sea fish and chip shop on Ferry Road does exactly what it says on the tin, or at least on the photos. It's the first chippy I'd been in where the photos of the food look exactly like what you'll get. Not tarted up, not airbrushed, just plain old chippy food. But good chippy food. Their chips are excellent. Fish very tasty and not too greasy. They do oven cooked pizza too, and these are very good. (For the traditionalists out there they also do fried pizza). Kebabs also, though I've never tried these. Special fish n' chips and Ben and Jerry's phish food, the complete fish experience! Who needs more?",
