    "text": "Myself and 3 friends took advantage of a 5pm deal here last night and had the restaurant to ourselves. The leek soup was praised by those that had it and I enjoyed the ham & game terrine. My main course of pheasant was a tad overly salted but the portion size was good. The chicken stuffed with haggis went down well though. The creme brulees were less set than you would generally want but the treacle tart was swiftly scoffed.   Service was very pleasant and the pot of tea very good value. The wine list was a tad on the pricey side (17.90 for the house red & white) although the glasses that came as part of the deal were very drinkable. Not having a card machine in the bistro seemed a little odd as you have to take your bill to reception and pay but otherwise this was a decent eating experience.",

    "text": "I ate here as some friends were staying at the Parliament House Hotel, of which this is the hotel's restaurant. They have a reasonable menu at reasonable prices but it is difficult to justify going to eat here where there are better quality restaurants nearby. If you are staying in the hotel and have dinner as part of your deal, then you won't be disapointed as its decent enough. You would not find many locals actually chosing to eat there on a night out though. The food was average and the atmosphere one of a hotel, not a stand-alone restaurant. The Howies restaurant next door is better. okay but not great!",
