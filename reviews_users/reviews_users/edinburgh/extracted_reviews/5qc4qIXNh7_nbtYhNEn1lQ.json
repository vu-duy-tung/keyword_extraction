    "text": "Zuhus is a halal establishment which serves mainly chicken dishes.  A lot of yelp reviews usually never reveal if an establishment is halal or not.  I think it is important for us to include in the review if the establishment is halal as we also have a lot of Muslim Yelpers and friends who would love to know that and we can help them in selecting restaurant.  Zuhus has a menu very much like Nando's.  Or shall I say 'exactly' like Nando's.  It's basically mainly peri peri based chicken, burgers and wraps.  I came here twice but only had the peri peri chicken.  The guy who served me was very accommodating.  I ordered half a chicken but with 2 quarter chicken legs and he gave it to me.    The taste of he chicken was up to scratch and the meat itself was juicy and tender.  The size of the chicken I believe is slightly bigger than what Nando's is serving, which is of course a value for money.    They have won my points on all aspects on value, taste and portion.  However, they have lost my point on creativity and originality.  This place is an exact replica of Nando's.  From the menu, sauce and the bottle for the sauce (tall rectangular bottle).  Why can't they come up with something more original?  I would still recommend people to come here and definitely be back again myself.",

The chicken was flavorful both the peri peri shredded chicken and the chicken wings.  If wanted, they also provide extra sauce that you can serve yourself.  It's self serve so you must order at the till when ready.    I would recommend this place, so why not give it a try?",

I'd also agree that it is a nice knock-off which I assume should be taking as a compliment?  They are a bit slow to get food out during busy times and the restaurant isn't as spacious as Nando's but I preferred the meal.",

However most American hot sauces are all about the heat and less about the flavor. The Peri Peri sauce has heat but lots of flavor. You select your choice of meat (chicken or burgers along with a variety of sides. Overall a good inexpensive restaurant with fast and good service.",
