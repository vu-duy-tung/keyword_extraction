(although the wraps have shrunk significantly over the last two years...!)   Dinner - no no. Been there several times and although its byob and therefore frequented by intrepid students, the food is poor and overpriced  Basically, 5 stars for lunch, 3 stars for dinner!",

I have been going for years, but now that I am working nearby I have to go at least once a week - nowhere else seems to compare to this Sudanese delight.   I love having a great value sit down lunch for no extra cost to a take away, with a warm friendly welcome, relaxed unpretentious atmosphere and upbeat afro-salsa beats. It does get busy at lunch time so opt for getting there early or late lunch if you want to eat in or avoid the queues.   Delicious mango, guava, and hibiscus drinks transports you on a mini holiday. The array of lunchtime khobz wrap fillings are mouthwatering... Tasty guacamole, spicy feta, babaganoush, marinaded aubergine, yoghurt and dill sauce...   The falafels deserve a special mention. They are not only the best in Edinburgh, but I would go so far as to say, the BEST IN THE WORLD! Simply to die for... I am salivating just thinking about them!   For afters, a sudanese tea or coffee, spiced with cardomon, cinnamon & cloves is a real treat and served best with a piece of their wonderful baklava.  Evening meals are also delicious and satisfying. No alcohol served here, but you're welcome to BYOB at no extra charge.   I go to The Nile Valley again and again... It never disappoints and I always leave with a smile :)",

They offer the same wraps as next door, with all the same yummy fillings like baba ghanoush, avocado, humus, chicken (which, by the way, makes a surprisingly good combination!) but the prices in here are more reasonable. Not that Coffee Etc is anywhere near expensive, but every little helps when you're a student!  The other big plus point about this place is that it has a downstairs seating area as well as the 3 or 4 tiny little tables upstairs. Which means that, unlike Coffee Etc between 12-3pm, you might stand a chance of getting somewhere to sit.  The baklava here's amazing too, and if you get one of the gorgous cartons of Rubicon Mango juice you ca kid yourself that it counts as one of your 5-a-day and so off-sets the sticky flaky baklava goodness.  Or at least that's what I convince myself every time I go.",

You know how sometimes if you buy a wrap from a sandwich shop it's a little soggy? Well the Nile Valley gives it a wee toast which makes all the difference. It's only about 3 for a wrap so you can get a really decent lunch to take out or eat in for just under a fiver.  Sitting in is ok in the Nile, there's a few seats downstairs and you always seem to be ok to get a place to sit. The place is a good mix of business people and students at lunchtime, however during the rest of the day it's largely populated by students chilling out and munching their lunch.  They do all kinds of different wraps and salad'y goodness, so if you're on a diet or a health-kick you'll be right as rain in the Nile.",

    "text": "Nile Valley's one of those places that come one o'clock on a weekday has a queue running outside full of students waiting to get their fill of a toasted wrap. That in itself to me says quite a fair amount - cheap, quality, quick and friendly.   And the wraps are delicious - my personal favourite is a mix of baba ghanoush, aubergine and falafel - but then again i like to go overboard with my aubergines, so maybe you might prefer it with their freshly-made hummus?   That's for a quick lunch, either on the go, or sitting in listening to the warm music of various parts of Africa - they don't seem too discerning, but it's all great. In the evening the place and food is an entirely different matter, and you can get some of the most unusually tasty dishes you'll come across, sitting downstairs in the cosy eating area. Fresh-water fish cooked slowly with apricots and almonds - who could ask for more?   If you've only ever been at lunch-time, go in the evening. If you've only ever been in the evening, go get a wrap. And if you've never been; well, you'll just have to spend all day there, get one of the papers they have and sip a freshly-made coffee till you've had your fill of both.",

Hailing from West Africa myself, I've hardly had the chance to try authentic cuisine from East Africa and I'm sad to say I'm still waiting; reason being that the Nile Valley offers a great lunch time menu, craftily mixing the standard student lunch (salads, wraps, sandwiches) with some Middle Eastern elements. For all other falafel enthusiasts out there, their wrap is phenomenal and definitely rivals Palmyra's. The other wraps I've tried, such as the chicken and avocado, do not disappoint, and the interior definitely complements the theme of the restaurant; African maps, art and pictures for the wandering eye! Leaving ground level for the basement is quite exciting, but the theme is pretty much the same, save for the added darkness which makes it even cosier. Students, businessmen etc frequent this place at lunch time, but I'm still very curious to try their dinner menu!",

The mixed grill is great if you are a meat eater but it's also a great place for vegetarians because there are lots of genuine vegetarian dishes.   They serve a delicious peanut-chilli sauce with some of the dishes. It would be worthwhile to ask the waiter or waitress which dishes come with the peanut sauce.   Any of the curry style dishes are good and the lime and peanut butter soup is excellent.",

The decor is plain and evidently done on a budget, which some people might consider an off-putting factor, but those of you out there who are after a more exotic menu and mouth-watering, endlessly marinated and juicy food will do well to persist with the Nile Valley. There are only a handful of tables upstairs, but the basement can accommodate larger groups. But its the food that makes this restaurant stand out- the highlights of the North African cuisine being Couscous, marinated chicken, grilled lamb chops and river fish, all oozing with flavours and spices, served by friendly if a bit inefficient staff. And did I mention the starters? Well worth getting at least one to share, with falafel, cheeses, fresh produce and flavour, flavour, flavour. If you are open-minded, patient, and ready for a meal unlike any you have previously had then the Nile Valley is the place for you.",

The falafel is AMAZING!! the crust around the falafel is super crunchy and consists of sesame seeds , bringing the flavor to a new level. The falafel , combined with the fresh hummus, is bliss.  The vegetarian bean dish tasted authentic and was filling ; very comforting. The flatbreads were huge and 2 were more than enough for 3 of us. We were stuffed after but there is always room for dessert -- the baklava is huuuge. It comes with 4 pieces and topped with whipped cream, one piece was chocolate baklava...I did not appreciate the whipped cream but the baklava itself was very good. We also had the ethipian tea which was flavorful and definitely a must have.  The owner of the establishment was very patient with us and later informed us that the restaurant was actually closed and only open for a special dinner earlier. He let us in and sit for 2 or so hours on a day off! Super nice!   Had a great meal here and would go back for the wrap m and more tea.",

    "text": "Another of my favourite Edinburgh eateries when I'm working in the area. I most often grab-and-run, as the Nile Valley does a brilliant take-away falafel and hummus wrap at a very reasonable price.  However this time, having more time to relax, I opted to sit in and tried one of their main vegetarian dishes. For the life of me I can't remember exactly what it was called, but it was something like 'Fuul Molousha' and according to the menu it's a staple of Sudanese cuisine. It was basically a large plate of a hot brown bean stew with salad accompaniment and some flat bread on the side. Simple and basic, not too inspiring, but tasty enough and under a tenner.   At first glance, it seems rather small in here, but there is a much larger area downstairs. The vibe is chilled, the staff smiling and friendly, and there's some cool Afro beats playing in the background, so you can't help tapping your feet to the rhythm and leaving with a smile on your face.",

If you're the kind of person who finds themselves in Palmyra or Zenobia but is a bit underwhelmed (or even think they're pretty awesome) I challenge you to get down to The Nile Valley. It thoroughly owns. I don't know if they make their own or source them from somewhere more interesting that the same place all the usual falafel providers get it from, but it's SOOOOO GOOOOOD.   They also serve a whole bunch of delicious other wrap fillings, and they switch from cafe to restaurant at some point in the evening. I think it'd make a pretty cool alt date location from the more typical spots in town.",

    "text": "The Nile Valley Cafe may appear humble from the outside (and on the inside too!), but if you are looking for authentic North African food in Edinburgh then look no further: this is the real deal.  Decoration has not been high on the priority list of this establishment, but don't be put off! Everything is unpretentious in here: the furniture, the menus, the crockery and cutlery. The emphasis is entirely on the food, as it should be.  The menus cover a decent range of North-African cuisine, catering well for both vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. They don't serve alcohol but it's BYOB with no corkage, so bring your own wine if that's your bag. There is a great selection of freshly squeezed fruit juices and Sudanese teas (including spiced black tea and the ubiquitous mint tea). My wife had the mango juice, which was delicious, and I had the mint tea, which was served in the classic tiny glass cup with a giant bowl of sugar, of course.  Now let's get serious here. I'm a self-confessed houmous snob and have tried houmous from Marrakesh to Baghdad. I can honestly say that the houmous in The Nile Valley Cafe was some of the best I've ever had. The falafel was also absolutely first rate.  I had the ful for my mains, and you might not think that a plate full of beans could be that appetising, but it was absolutely delicious. It was unpretentious and simple but authentically made and tasted just great. Everything was also served with a smile by the very friendly waiter, who was happy to give recommendations when we weren't sure what to order.  If you are feeling bold, give the Sudanese coffee a try. It's EXTREMELY strong a spicy, but I've never tasted anything like it before.  It seems like a serious injustice that this place was almost empty on a Friday night. I strongly recommend checking it out.",

    "text": "This is one of my friend's favourite eateries, and I've been here with him twice, both times for lunch. Both times I had an Africa Wrap - a speciality of the house - I liked it so much the first time I had a second one!  Because the wraps here are made from garam flour, they are gluten free! The Africa Wrap had beans, feta, falafel and salad, and it was toasted. It was also the biggest wrap I've ever seen in my life. spicy sauce was optional (I had it the first time but not the second since it was a bit hot for me - recommended for people who like their food to have a kick tho!)  The falafel on offer here is the best falafel I've had. This is high-fibre, high-taste food, it's filling, it's healthy, and it's delicious. Such a rare combination! It's also great for vegetarians.   They also have lovely tea. It's unlike any I've had elsewhere (I think it's Sudanese tea but I'm unsure) and I drink it in massive quantities when I go here.   The price is cheap, extremely cheap for edinburgh and for the amount of food you get for your buck. It's properly authentic food, and it's one of the few times a mad carnivore like me has really, really enjoyed vegetarian fayre. Recommended.",

    "text": "The Nile Valley Cafe is a fantastic place to go for lunch and one of my favourite hang outs. It is just a stones throw away from the main University campus, George Square, so it is a very convenient place for students to go for their lunch. There is always a queue at lunch time coming out of this small cafe of students wanting to buy their lunch - always a good sign.   The Nile Valley Cafe offers a huge range of authentic African and ethnic dishes, and there is such a wide variety available that there will be something on their menu to suit everyone. They serve really delicious wraps for lunch with a whole range of fillings such as hummus, falafel, babaganoush and mezze, as well as the more traditional fillings such as cheese, salad and a selection of meats. They offer a range of pate's, and the chicken liver pate is particularly delicious.   I love their falafel and salad wrap, which is really reasonable at about 3. The servings in here are incredibly generous and I find that if I have a wrap from here for lunch, I am not hungry the rest of the day. There is a lovely seating area downstairs which is a good size where you can listen to African style music.   The Nile Valley Cafe offers a huge selection of non-meat options so it is a great place for vegetarian's as there is bound to be something on their menu to suit everyone.   As well as wraps, the Nile Valley Cafe offer a selection of soups, their roasted red pepper soups is truly delicious, as well as a selection of main meals such as fish and meats cooked in a mouth watering marinade.",

Apparantly they've been around for fifteen years which is impressive and you only have to venture in once to understand why.   I usually have a flatbread jam packed with chicken and ganoush which costs around 3.50 and more than satisfies any lunchtime cravings.  Their ingredients are always fresh and they have a great range of authentic African as well as local produce.  For example, on their dinner menu they offer Scottish lamb which is slow cooked with herbs for tenderness. It's a great place to come for cheap, tasty and different food at reasonable prices.",

The African theme runs throughout the decor and the people, everyone is so welcoming and happy. They have a great selection of wraps that they make right infront of you and they are YUMMY!! Hoummas and Falafel especially is my favourite, and I've worked my way through a few different flavours. Each wrap is around 3 and there's a great student discount. Nile Valley, I salute you",

I'm a big fan of this type of cuisine: if there's hummus, aubergines, and lamb then count me in. And if it's BYOB even better. Nile Valley ticks all of these boxes, and is therefore firmly on my roster of places to get a good dinner with friendly service in Edinburgh.   The staff are very accommodating and will even find you a table during the festival. The last time I visited there was a minor issue with our starter not arriving on time; the manager personally came out to apologise to us, and we were given it for free. Very different treatment to certain fine dining institutions.",
