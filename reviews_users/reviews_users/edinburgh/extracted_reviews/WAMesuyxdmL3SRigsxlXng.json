The place was rammed when I was there and it wasn't even 7.15 pm. The staff, the food are all exceptional and for such a small venue they do a fantastic job of not falling short on service. I agree with another reviewer, the Turkish coffee will have you running naked down Princes Street.. Best way to describe this place? A little bit of Turkey here in Edinburgh.",

This is the best Turkish restaurant in Edinburgh, small, simple but the food is fantastic and very reasonably priced. The kebabs are unbelievably tasty especially the chicken. This time around we diverged from the mixed mezze starter and chose at random including favourites from last time, Borek, cannellini bean salad, meatballs and spicy sliced sausage with pitta bread and olives, followed by lamb and chicken kebabs, lovely buttery rice, a bowl of creamy cacek and two bowls of delicious chilli sauce. (last time we found one bowl a bit small for us to share so had to ask for another) The combination is fabulous. Rather ashamed to admit we succumbed to greed and had baklava for dessert. What can I say? My teeth may never recover from the sweetness but it was an experience! Can't wait to return!",

Tried the hummus, mixed grill kebabs and a few Hoegaarden's to wash it down.  Make reservations or get there right when they open - the space is small and was packed when I got there early on a Saturday evening.",

Hanedan's food is superb - absolutely superb. It is fantastic value, with main courses only setting you back around 10. But the portions are very generous and after an evening there, you will be nursing a very full stomach.   The starters are beautiful, a really good selection of authentic Turkish dishes such as Dolma, Hummus, Borek (you HAVE to try this!), Sucuk (gorgeous Turkish sausage) and many more.   The main courses are all very, very good. The kofta is my favorite and will fill you up no problem.   It is run by a very friendly guy that cooks all the food and always goes round to each table to check people are enjoying their food. The serving staff are also very friendly.   The decor is very tasteful and it is a great place for a romantic meal.   You have to try this restaurant, you really do!",

They are so lovely and welcoming, which makes for a really nice, friendly atmosphere within the restaurant.   The food is traditional Turkish, but not the greasy, cheap cuts of meat that some places use. Here everything tastes fresh and has strong flavours. We went as a large group and opted for a selection off the meze menu to start. This was a great way to taste everything on the menu, but be warned, it is very filling! The main courses were equally good, although there was no way any of us were finishing any of them after the starters!   Overall, i thought the prices were fairly decent. Our meal came in at around 20 a head, which was great given the amount of food we ate.",

We decided to order a few starters and share, as it all looked so good!  The halloumi cheese was yum, the spinach/feta pastry was ace and the humus was beautiful!  Mains was a mixed grill for each of us and I don't think I've ever eaten such soft and scrumpalicious rice! (And I've lived in Japan!)  It was a perfect complement to the meat, which was also lovely.  The staff were attentive and our meal was reasonably priced for the quality of food.  All in all, a cosy and intimate restaurant with tasty food.  Will most definitely go back when in Edinburgh.",

You are guaranteed a very warm welcome and will be looked after by the staff and owner (who is the chef who cooks all of the food at the front of the restaurant!). The cuisine itself is divine, with a excellent selection of starters, and main courses with vegetarian options. There is of course a great range of drinks for both those over and under 18. The restaurant is perfect for romantic meals for two as well as a family meal. It is great value for money with a two course special for under 10.   The atmosphere is always great with Turkish background music and the hum of people talking. It is almost always full so it is best to book in advance. Happy Dining !!",

I just travelled through Asia, Australia, New Zealand and the USA and i couldn't find any Turkish food as good as that in Hanedan.  We always order a few starters between us: the hummus, feta salad and the meatballs are our favourite; this also comes with all you can eat pita bread.  The feta cheese is unbelievably creamy and all of the meat is so juicy - I recommend the chicken or the lamb.  But I can never choose between the meats, so I usually have the mixed grill.  Also, even the rice is tasty - I don't know how you can make rice tasty, but they do it.  I look forward to eating here every time I make a reservation.",

Tthe menu is varied - we usually have the mixed meze starter which is about 13 for 2 people and contains 5 or 6 different hot and cold meze including meatballs, hoummus and vine leaves, and then wish we hadn't ordered a main course because the meze is HUGE.   There is a good choice for vegetarians, and a small and reasonably priced wine list. They also, strangely, have an extensive whisky selection.",

The place itself is quite small and the tables are all jammed up close to each other but for me that just adds to the atmosphere (it has been busy every time i've been there).   The food is typical Turkish, standard mezze and then a selection of kebabs etc. Don't be afraid to just order lots of mezze and leave the meat heavy kebabs if that's how you feel, or batter in to the mixed grill if you are the opposite.   Hanedan is definitely one of the best reasonably priced restaurants in Edinburgh and worth a look.

Bro, I am so there.  \"There\" was a little spot in Newington, huddling glumly in the blackness of a wet November night. No glumness was within, however: we were seated with jovial alacrity by the window, with some upbeat discussion of the view (sky water falling on road water, and some road water attempting in hissing salmon jumps to go back up to being sky water).  Seated in the dimness of almost total candlelight with the occasional orange flare of flame from the kitchen beside us, we were given a tour of the heating options (overhead and under the table). They brought us a little battery-powered lamp while we browsed the menu - such a thoughtful and cute touch.  We ordered three meze to start us off - herring salad, squid and walnut salad, and honeydew melon with feta cheese. Woah. The herring was deliciously sweet, fresh and syrupy; the squid had clearly at some point in its recent past actually been a squid, and the honeydew... hoooooooooo. I was expecting a couple of delicate slices but we were given a great bowl full of melony chunks and a goodly wadge of feta unexpectedly topped with mint, which was a lovely touch.  These three dishes alone were almost enough but we decided to get some mains as well since it was so good!  For Bro, grilled lamb. For Sis, vegetable moussaka. I'm told the lamb was awesome. As for my moussaka - well, I'm used to moussaka being something of a slop. A tasty slop, but slop nonetheless. This, however, had not only flavour but form and texture. It cut in neat slices and was quite the revelation - absolutely delicious. We rounded it all off with some gorgeous sticky baklava too, and the whole bill - illuminated by the return of the little battery-lamp - came to 50. Amazing.  We sat there for a pretty long time waiting for the downpour to abate and never once felt rushed or like the staff were waiting for us to go. Once the sky water had finally all become road water, we left feeling about three stone heavier, but a fresh and healthy weight rather than just a lump of stodge. This was a meal I'll remember for a long time. Nonetheless, I might feel compelled before long to, er... refresh my memory...",

A worthy 'm,' if I've ever seen one. What's this leading to then? The hummus of Hanedan retained its second 'm' undoubtedly, passionately. It even had 'm's to spare. It had 'm's in the bank. It had copious 'm's, each one accentuating its bean-y, protein-y, non-soil-y nature. I won't be recommending it to my earthworm or geophage friends, but others should enjoy!",

Overall, we said: \"I was delighted with Hanedan. I'll need to come back with a few chums to have a good go at their meze, but on the basis of today I have a strong feeling that this is the best place for Turkish food in the city. I'd heartily recommend you pay it a visit, at your earliest convenience.\"",

I love being able to visit the places tucked away from touristy areas, and this was it!  We ordered the hummus and feta salad to start, and what amazing portions!  The waitress had to bring out a second basket of pita to finish it, with the added bonus that it was warm when it arrived, yum!  Feta tasted homemade it was so soft and flavorful, and there were so many plump veggies in the bowl that I couldn't finish it!  We both got the chicken shish, which had a lovely grilled flavor and perfectly made rice.  I think we piled on the spicy sauce to add a little perk to the meal, but that's why they serve it, I guess!  Overall it was delicious and we left feeling absolutely stuffed.  One small note, make sure to get a booking because we didn't (as we arrived at 5:45 when there was almost no one seated) and were told that we had to be out by 7 at the latest.  It was no problem to do so, but I felt a little rushed.",

This is probably one of my favourite restaurants in Edinburgh and I've been a few times, always leaving stuffed and happy.  The menu has an excellent selection of slow-cooked meat and vegetarian dishes as well as a wide range of kebabs, dips and breads.  I usually have either the marinated  lamb or chargrilled chicken which is served on a skewar with fresh salad and a really light, fresh yoghurt dip.   They also do a lot of quality wines and beers alongside iced teas and specialist coffees.  You can can have a great meal here for about a tenner which is great value when you consider the quality of the experience as a whole.",

    "text": "I love Turkish food.  The problem with Hanedan is that I love the food so much that I just wanted to order everything on the menu and eat it all.  The other problem is that the portions are *really* generous so you end up feeling as though you might need to be rolled out of the restaurant because you can't bring yourself to stop eating because it's too tasty.    In addition to the incredibly tasty and lage plates of food, the staff and owner/chef (I think?) are absolutely lovely and good for a laugh, and the setting is cute and cozy.    I would say that the only downside is that the mains seem to be quite plain - meat and rice - and really would benefit from an accompaniment.  You end up almost needing to order a starter in order to have a bit of variety, but you ultimately end up with too much food, really.  I couldn't finish my main and had absolutely eaten as much as could fit in my belly.",

Hanedans however, didntlet me down - certainly the vast amount of food that was ordered (which was great for us all to share about) was very tasty indeed, if not quite my thing. It is however quite clear of the chef's passion for his food as it is all beautifully presented as well as great tasting.  Staff were friendly and the restaurant was relaxeing, if a bit cramped with so many tabvles in a small room.  Overall, while not quite Turkey the country, Hanedans is no turkey itself.",

Top marks for the hummus too.  I kind of wished we'd got loads of small plates and picked and shared, but my companion here isn't a sharer (I know, why are we still friends?

A quick search of Yelp and found Hanedan was a few blocks away so we decided to give it a try.  They sat us in the back room and brought us water fairly quickly. We ordered two of the combo dinners (With chicken shish one with humaz and one with red lentil soup) and the Borak (Filo Pastry filled with Feta and spinach) and a single 10 year old Arran Whisky.  Our waitress was friendly and efficient and the owner (or manager) asked her to bring us extra pitta bread when we were low.  The servings of everything were fairly generous and we have enough left over for another meal tomorrow.  The only disappointment is that this restaurant isn't near our home in San Francisco.",

    "text": "Oh my oh my, what a dang treat! Last Saturday after the SO and I had a day about town lunch was obviously in order; after reading the overwhelmingly glowing reviews of Hanedan we headed right in--and now, having been, I'm happily joining the ranks!  Hanedan is a wee joint with about 10 tables tops, which I think makes reservations during weekends (especially in the evening) a must. Upon entering you'll notice a grill right smack dab in the center of the front room, and if you're like us you'll be greeted with a smile by the owner?/chef. The next room in has a few more tables in it, and is simply but nicely decorated. Our order was taken quickly by a friendly waitress and we were served our starters in good time. That's when the game changed. Normally starters are good, but these starters--hummus and some flaky, perfectly puffed spinach+feta pastries--were DECADENT. Like, close your eyes and relish each bite kind of good. I don't know what voodoo created those little pastries, as surely only the dark arts can make something so yummy!  It seems that Hanedan does have only a handful of selections for vegetarians which would be the only downside I could see if, say, you wanted to eat there literally every day, but for hubs and I the two veggie choices were just fine and we ended up getting the same thing anyway. Not long after the starters a feta salad arrived (I think our eyes were well bigger than our stomachs when we ordered) as well as two perfect veggie moussaka mains. By the end of all of that saucy, veggie-filled deliciousness, I had to beg for a carry away box for mine, and husband had to be airlifted out of the place after finishing his lot. (Extra perk: when I came back to said leftovers later, it was just as good if not better... Seriously, what voodoo is this?!)  In the end I'm tickled pink to have found such a refreshingly different, friendly, and dark-magically delicious restaurant. Any place that can take something as routine as hummus and make your eyes pop out your head when you sample it is five stars in my book! I recommend anyone venturing about the Newington/Buccleuch side of town stop in here--you won't regret it!",

Service: The cook/owner was very accommodating to our group of 5, even though the place is very tiny.  The waitress was very attentive and brought our food out in a timely manor. The cook/owner also frequently walks around the restaurant and checks on people to make sure everything is alright and that every one is pleased.   Ambiance: Some very cool, but weird music. Dimly lit, but still enough to see everything and everyone. Very simply decorated and very small, but very homey and comfortable. I felt like it was more a place where family gathers for a dinner.   Food: OH DEAR GOD... The food is very simply seasoned, but seasoned perfectly. All the meats are cooked perfectly, not overcooked at all. It is very juicy and succulent. We also had some of their fabulous appetizers, of which I would recommend the hummus along with the melon and feta. I've only had better hummus in Israel.   Overall: You need to come here. If you are a local, hit it up for a night after dancing at summerhall or just for an easy, fun night out.  If you are a tourist, take a break from the standard Scottish pub food for a night and take part in this deliciousness. I swear, you WILL NOT be disappointed.",

They were all so kind, and knowing we came from the states Gursel treated us to some extra tastes from the cold meze menu!  Hanedan is a hidden gem. Don't miss it.",

    "text": "Really lovely and quick service. Although it's essential you make a reservation on weekends as we'd wandered over the previous Friday night and they couldn't even squeeze us in. It's cute and quaint and yes the food is lovely, well cooked with good flavours.  But it didn't blow us away which is why I settled with 4stars instead of 5. The Hanedan Mess I will give a 5star to however as it was absolutely delicious!",

    "text": "What I first liked about this place is the fact that as soon as you step in you can feel a new atmosphere, as if you were far away from a British city, just in a Mediterranean restaurant, maybe even on the sea. It was just me and a friend, we sat comfortably at a table for four people and the smiling waiter took our orders.   To be honest we decided to walk for quite a while and come here mainly because of the outstanding yelp reviews. So we probably had too high expectations. The food was definitely good, even though I wouldn't classify it as extraordinary. I went for chicken with mushrooms, which was a very nice dish; the only remark I could do is that the portion of rice was too small for all the meat and the sauce. On the other hand my friend, much knowledgeable Turkish cuisine, opted for a moussaka, and she fairly liked it. Prices are reasonable, and the place has a very welcoming and familiar atmosphere.",

    "text": "Um yeah. The food from this place is really yummy and tasty!  The portions are generous and the staff very attentive.  We arrived after a nice bike ride through the meadows ( I didn't realise how close this place was to the meadows!) They have funny hours and close between lunch and dinner but we got there with plenty of time to relax and have a delicious lunch. The cook, who had been at the BBQ came up to us and offered our little one a wee bowl of rice which she loved. Very nice thoughtful gesture.   The chicken and lamb were both succulent and very tasty. The dips were all very good and this is the first place that gives you as much pita bread as you want without charging an arm and a leg for it! Very impressed with everything.   This place is definitely going on our favorites list as we all thoroughly enjoyed the food and our visit to this wee charming place.",

The squid appetizer was extraordinary (would have loved it as an entree had it been offered).  I loved my swordfish--very fresh, nicely prepared and spiced.  My husband's garlic sausage made me jealous.  Plus, they have yummy Turkish wine.  They were very patient with our somewhat disoriented and extremely tired and hungry family of three.  My son and I fought over the Hanedan Mess (strawberries, whipped cream, and meringue.  Why hadn't I thought of that before?)",

    "text": "An evening dining in Hanedan is always a good one. The food here is just SO delicious.   They have a huge range of starters and these are probably my favourites on the menu.  I can strongly recommend the Borek- delicious crispy filo with spinachy feta goodness. Other favourites include their melon and feta (anything with feta is amazing in my opinion), the grilled halloumi and the humous, which comes with a never ending supply of pitta.   For mains there are all sorts of options including yummy mousakka, grilled meats all with gorgeous herbs and spices. The only thing I would mention is that veggie choices are a bit limited, but the choices they do have are tasty.   This place is small and cosy, has a great atmosphere and has been enjoyed by all that have visited with me. The staff were very friendly and it was reasonably priced with mains around 8-10. If you fancy trying somewhere a little bit different I would thoroughly recommend.",

Words cannot describe from the Mezze (cold and hot) to the Moussaka to the Turkish Coffee and Baklava it was all delicious. Hanedan captured everything I love about Turkish food. The nuttiness of Turkish coffee, the lightness of cold Mezze, the tanginess in hummus.",
