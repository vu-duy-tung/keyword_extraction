    "text": "'we're meeting at secret arcade on friday' was the message i got on wednesday afternoon.  secret arcade i thought.... was the location secret, is there a secret handshake to get in, will someone tell me how to get there??  lucky for me, i was with a group of friends that were well in on the secret so i didn't have to get lost or try out any secret handshakes.  secret arcade is a very cool polish vodka bar that has an amazing collection of high quality vodkas.  it also has good music, nice staff, and very cool decor with awesome red tiled light up chairs right at the top of the staircase.  being slightly tipsy on arrival i wasn't sure if these chairs were actually glass and if i could sit in them.  i did find out they weren't glass, but i never sat in them as we moved into the back room to take advantage of the large table and big bench for lots of people to sit at.  there was also a tv which was showing the matrix in case we had a lull in the conversation.  checking in on the yelp app you get a free shot of a vodka of the week.  i opted for the skittle vodka which very much tasted like a skittle.  it also didn't taste at all like vodka, which could be seen as a good and bad thing.  i got to try some of Jennie's fudge vodka which was also incredibly nice.  i then opted for a cosmo arcade that had cranberry vodka, cranberry juice and lime juice and another vodka that escapes my mind.  Valerie and i decided these were very good and had a second just to confirm.  i ended my night with a hazelnut vodka as recommended by Joe which was both delicious and deadly at the same time.  happily buzzed from the vodka, i descended the stairs back to cockburn street and headed home.  but i definitely felt like i'd been let in on a very cool secret that i want to share with others.  vodka bars are awesome and vodka in any form is a delightful drink!",

    "text": "I visit Cockburn Street frequently but more so for the kooky shops and hadn't really taken note of the Secret Arcade before. So I totally expected a gaming scene with slot machines and tables but it was an arcade of a different sort. Downstairs was quite small, lightly decorated and modern and seemed to be mainly for dining. Upstairs made use of the stone walls giving a cave like effect . It was small and filled up by 11pm but service was still quite quick at the bar, staff were friendly. I could really taste the rainbow through my skittles vodka shot and ended up having 2 cosmo arcades which were delicious! Having already eaten I was quite envious of the haggis stacks that came out of the kitchen and definately want to come back here to try the food........and more vodka from the extensive vodka menu - well it is vodka bar afterall!",

    "text": "I can't believe it's taken me four years to find this place! It's tucked in behind Fabrick on Cockburn Street, so much so that'd you'd easily be forgiven for walking past and not even noticing it's there.  When you do find it though, you instantly feel really smug as if you're part of some sort of exclusive club: everyone that knows about it raves about it, and everyone that doesn't just stands there looking really confused and bemused whilst other people bang on about how good it is.  You don't need to have been to Poland to appreciate the delights of good quality vodka. We've all been in a situation where we've woken up with an undeserved hangover, only to eventually work out that your awful state of health isn't so much to do with the quantity of what you drank as opposed to the quality of it. That's not the case here.  Their vodkas are all good quality names, both ones that are well-known in the UK and ones that aren't; but either way you can rest assured that what you're drinking is good stuff.  I was lucky enough to discover this place just after I'd got home from my first trip to Krakow, and very much pining after cherry vodka served over ice, or honey vodka failing that. And I'm pleased to announce, this place can cater for bother of those demands. Although it is a bit on the pricey side (which is why I'm not giving it 5 stars), it's definitely one of Edinburgh nightlife's best-kept secrets.",

I had never heard of this place before, I guess that's why they call it a secret, and I was pretty smug when I found it! It wasn't very busy, and the interior was lovely, it really oozed a cool aura. Very stylish.  I chose a vodka, I can't remember the name now, but it was the strongest thing I have ever tasted. Oh my God. I'm surprised I was still standing after one. I can't imagine how much training these barmen and women have had to do to remember them all.  It was a good experience though, and if I wasn't so much of a lightweight I would have tried more!

However you might make your way into town though, I highly recommend this place!  The food here is exceptional, regardless of whether you're one of those veggie types, or one of us dyed-in-the-wool Carnivores :-)  My friend went with the vegetarian haggis, which he said was right on the money.  I went with the beef pie.  To be precise, it's not really a pie, it's a rich stew with a small square of puffed pastry on top.  Both the presentation and the taste of this dish were exceptional!  I'll happily order it again next time.  The service here is friendly and on point; Oh, and last (and certainly not least) there's a wonderful selection of whiskeys to try - highly recommended!",

When we arrived there was one other couple there having some drinks and a group in the back section, but other than that it was very quiet with a real nice atmosphere.   Prices have gone up a little since they posted their menu on their website, but only by 1 or so which still made them extremely affordable. Most averaged to about 3.50, with some of the more premium brands costing 5.50 per drink. Not bad at all!  While we did not try the food, it smelled and looked delicious.   The bartender was very friendly and the atmosphere was calm throughout our stay, with only one other couple coming in after everyone else had left.   Unfortunately, they don't accept the yelp coupon for a free shot anymore, but it doesn't even matter the prices and quality of service more than make up for it.   We will definitely stop by again. I can't recommend checking it out enough if you are in Edinburgh!",

The homemade vodka's are a bit daunting, but taste ridiculously good, give them a try! There is a vodka for everyone, from sweet fruity ones to clear and crisp and a few odd ones thrown in as well! If you're not fan of the vodka, there are other drinks on offer as well. My recommendation is the marshmallow vodka with soda, just yum!

    "text": "The quest to find Secret Arcade was a long and laborious one. Now that I'm in on the secret, I can totally say it was worth the wait.  A couple of us had heard tell of a Polish vodka bar hidden well off the beaten track, up one of the many alleyways and closes that branched off of Cockburn Street. Anyone that knows of the labyrinthine walkways to which I refer will understand that finding a small vodka bar, with nary a name to go on, was no mean feat.  Help, however, was at hand in the form of good ol' faithful Word Of Mouth. And by way of a friend of a friend of a friend, one sad St. Paddy's Day (it was Kerrin's Leaving Do... Paddy just so happened to share the occasion...!) our merry fellowship set off on our quest... and struck gold!  Be very careful to whom you divulge the information I am about to share. Once they know, there's a chance you'll see them a lot more often....!  The Secret Arcade is in fact the elusive upper level of Cockburn Street's Arcade Pub. Entry can be gained by way of the back staircase during the day, but after 7pm, up the dark, narrow and mysterious Jackson's Close, the Secret Arcade opens its own doors for those clever (or informed) enough to find it.  Venture upstairs to find an ever-so hip bar of Polish delights. Armchairs that glow like lampshades in the dimness, two intimate rooms of seating and standing room, a menu of 80+ flavoured vodkas, and more sociable Poles than you can shake a car full of cabbage at. Everything about this place screams cool, from the reputation, to the music, to the decor. Secret Arcade has it in droves.  Now that I've found it, my only worry is that the secret will get out soon and this place will succumb to a horde of drunken chavs and/or students before long. There's something really cool about being in the know about this clandestine bar... it even has me questioning whether to post this review....!?  I've raved about the social aspects, but it doesn't end there. Also available in the bar downstairs, Secret Arcade does some of the most interesting and tasty pub grub in the Royal Mile neighbourhood.  Twice I've been lucky enough to dine here. First time round I plumbed for the Pork & Chorizo Burger, with cheddar, caramelised onion, tomato and Marie Rose sauce. Served with chips and side salad. On my next visit I absolutely had to go for the Robert Burns Haggis Stack with whiskey sauce... oh wow! It's like they took a sand castle bucket and filled it with pure Scotland (see the photo, see it now!) - absolutely delicious. The little tweaks they make to classic gastro dishes is pretty interesting, such as the Marie Rose sauce on a pork burger. They certainly don't skimp on portions or flavour for that matter, and prices are hugely reasonable for what you get.  I want to tell you to find this place, I want to tell you to go. I really do.... but I won't!",

Hidden (where the secret comes from I guess) in a close and up a winding stair in the heart of Edinburgh, this place is one secret I would happily keep, though part of me thinks they need an old 80's style arcade machine in the corner...  The Secret Arcade is a quirky and reasonably priced \"proper\" vodka bar (they keep the speciality vodkas chilled and they are mostly polish/russian) outside of vodka though the other drinks selection is far more limited than the options provided by more commercial bars.  In short Secret Arcade is better suited to being a stopping point, than a bar you linger in, as it is all about the vodka - but it is definitely somewhere worth stopping if you like vodka.",

There are 2 entrances and a narrow hallway leads to the first floor with rooms still surrounded by original stone walls.  They serve vodka shots and Heineken drinks. I like the option of 8 shots all served in one for about 10. The couches are very comfortable and colourful.  Personally I feel that the toilets are bit on the small side. Not much space to maneuver around.  The nusic is typical pop and charts. Prices for drinks are affordable. There is no table service and no food upstairs. Downstairs is a restaurant which is separate from the Arcade.  I can recommend this place for friends and acquaintances on a night out. It has less appeal for families with children.  If you attempt to take your date there best you consider a weekday when it's not busy.  Otherwise, enjoy!",

Equally though, I'm a sucker for fancy-looking bottles and bar paraphernalia, so it didn't take a lot of arm twisting to get me fully into the spirit (fnar).  I started off with a quince vodka shot, which was very sweet and very tart, but delicious ice-cold. Drink it down though, because it doesn't work quite as well as it warms up. Hazelnut vodka was another big winner with the whole group; as a shot, over ice or as part of a cocktail it was really superb. I personally enjoyed it most straight-up though: boozy Nutella, mmmmm.  A Yelp check-in earns you a free shot of any of the house vodkas, which on the evening in question included skittles and fudge. Interesting.  Be warned though, double measures seem to be the default in SA's cocktails, so keep an eye on how much you're actually drinking, or your evening may be shorter than you'd hoped. Also, there's a massive TV in the bar area. Okay, it's only showing music videos, but it's hard to ignore a screen no matter how vapid the content is (and trust me, it was pretty vapid).  The bar itself is tucked away down a narrow alley off the High Street and feels very cool. I was wearing braces (in readiness for The Green Door later, I should say) and nobody batted an eyelid - it's that kind of place. That bar staff are also cool and very happy to talk vodka to the uninitiated, which I always take to be a good sign. I left with the feeling that I'd only just scratched the surface, and that perhaps there's more to vodka than I had supposed.",

We entered on street level and saw there were some people eating and there was a chilled atmosphere. We noticed a free corner so we asked if there was space for us and were advised to go 'up the stairs'. (downstairs is for eating food I concluded?)  Once upstairs we found ourselves in an attic bar filled with modern chairs, round tables, coloured strings of lights and spots. They have some cosy corners.  It was busy but not packed. The humidity was quite an issue, however a few cleverly placed floor fans sorted that out nicely and in turn provided that all important 'breezy-wind-in-hair-effect-when-sweaty' to some girls' poses - very nice indeed!   The crowd is young, hip and friendly. The serving staff is smiley, friendly and very efficient. We originally went for some whisky (not realising this is a vodka bar)  But after that first dram we settled in the 'spirit' and ordered shots and shots.. I had also some tequila shots -  It. Makes. Me. Happy.  It is a place I will visit again and I think that the location should stay slightly secret so space will not become a premium.",

I had haggis, neeps and tatties with whisky sauce and it was absolutely delicious, although a huge portion!  All in all, i can't wait to go back and try more vodka from the extensive menu! :)",

    "text": "This is what  I love about Edinburgh. After you think you have seen it all a gem like this pops up and you are in love with this City all over again.   This secret polish vodka bar is located on top of the Arcade pub, mostly geared to younger crowds.  I came here one Sunday after a gig with some friends and because it was early it was quiet. However, this place is TINY  with two small rooms and a bar.  The atmosphere is set with the funky decoration(check out my photos) and the candle lit tables.   They have the most amazing selection of polish vodkas. Their menu and the choices seem endless and  has very useful descriptions in English under each type (including quotes such as \"Chuck Norris wouldn't mind\" ) I had no idea that their was such a variety in Polish vodkas!  If you are confused as I was about what mixer goes with your choice in vodka the bartender is really helpful and friendly. They even have fun straws for their drinks and the prices are just right!  Vodka fans rejoice!",

    "text": "This place has got it nailed in the name...... SECRET.   I had no idea this place even existed until Mr. Joe A was adamant we go find it on St Patricks Day and give it a go!! Ok, so by the time we arrived here some of us were well on our way but the 5 shots of vodka for 10.99 totally sounded like a good idea!?   I ended up having 3 different kinds of vodka here, a blackcurrant one, Lime and then something with paprika and black pepper (I wanted to be different!?) and they were all pretty good. Apart from that they taste just like a shot of vodka. I would definitely say if you are going, mix them! My tatanka was delicious though!  The atmosphere is good, the surroundings are pretty nice, the menu sounded yummy!!! I would go back again, but maybe in a more sober frame of mind to properly enjoy it!",

    "text": "Recently I'd heard a lot of whispering about this little hidden secret just off Cockburn Street.  I was intrigued and wanted to go and check this place out for myself.    I went in at 11pm on a Saturday night which I'll admit was my first mistake as this Polish vodka bar was full to the brim!    I was pleased to discover that they had a promotion of 5 shots of vodka for 10.99 and you can basically choose any vodka from the extensive menu except a couple that are excluded.  Great deal and fun way of trying different flavoured vodkas.  However everytime finally I chose a flavour and ordered they said they didn't have it so it took me ages to actually place my order.    Unfortunately that's the best thing I have to say about this place.  I do want to give it another shot, perhaps for food as I've heard good things however I won't be rushing back to be honest.",

    "text": "Really good place to have a few drinks. Atmosphere is good and lively. At first the place was a bit difficult to find as it's hidden up a small walkway. We went there on a Friday night and were lucky to get a table as it was so busy. Staff were very nice and have a good knowledge of the drinks menu. For me it was a unique experience as I'd never got to visit a vodka bar before. Would highly recommend it and will defiantly be back next time I'm in Edinburgh.",

    "text": "Theres nothing quite like realising that somewhere you think you know holds a secret. A secret arcade no less. That sells excellent vodka's.  Hidden away this secret Polish vodka bar makes no excuses if you dont know it - its tiny is what I'm trying to say. Theres two rooms and a bar - all of which are infinatly funky and stylish.  The main plus for this place is the most amazing selection of Vodka's - I've never seen so many. It's not like Revolution where its normal vodka with different flavours in it, there are different types of vodka - I've tried as many as I can and the best as i can describe it is a range of smooth to harsh flavours or strenghts of taste. Who knows, it all goes down the same way and i love it.  But this place is a secret, so I'm trusting you to help keep it that that way :)",

    "text": "This bar is one of Edinburgh's best kept secrets. Sandwiched between the Royal Mile and Cockburn street on a dodgy looking back alley, the Secret Arcade is amazing. Heading up the stairs you find a pretty small bar, but turning around there is quite a big side room, especially good for birthday parties, as it is all one big table. The bar staff here are really cool, and recommend certain vodkas to you.  Because that's what this place is, mainly a Polish vodka bar. They also do Tyskie and Zywiec but the primary focus is on vodka, and with about 100 odd on the menu it doesn't disappoint. With flavours ranging from apple, banana, cherry etc to Turkish delight, there is everything a vodka lover could want. They also have different strengths, going anywhere from about 30% to 95% which, from personal experience, is deadly.   If you haven't been to this bar yet, definitely head off there, for a great atmosphere, awesome drinks and a completely different experience from most Scottish bars.",
