This place looked like just the ticket and as they had several veggie options available, I thought I'd give it a try.   The service was fast and attentive without being in-your-face, and although I don't think the food would win any awards in a Thai cooking competition, it was okay and quite reasonably priced. This is not somewhere I'd return to if I was looking for a good Thai meal, but for a quick noodle fix it does the job.",

The egg fried rice was good. The egg rolls need to be cooked a little bit more because you don't see the the brown color of the wrapper. They looked like they were still raw but they weren't. They tasted alright. I am.convinced that this resto's market is the younglings because the music is so loud and they were playing hip hop and dance club type of music. One of the staff was busy sampling ice cream. Either she tried 3 different flavors or 3 same flavors.",

Instead of the flat chow fun noodles it came with skinny noodles.  There was a burnt taste to the chicken and the whole dish in general.  On the menu it clearly states the dish cost 9.95 but I was charged 10.95.  When I brought this up the server said it was a misprint on the menu.   The menu states that the pad see ew is one of their signature dishes.  I would have to disagree.",

    "text": "I know there's a part of you that's inching towards trying this place, but listen to me when I warn you: Don't do it. Don't do it. Just don't even think about it.  The smells are delicious, but very deceiving when it comes to my experience with Noodle 'N Ice. My friend and I decided to give this place a try since we've both passed it and hadn't tried it during our time in Edinburgh. I ordered the Pad See Ew and my friend ordered a soup. She originally wanted the Tom Kha, but when asked whether or not it had coconut milk (as it wasn't listed as an ingredient), the waitress said no. Subsequently, we were left puzzled. Coconut milk is a main ingredient in this Thai staple, and yet it was missing. This should have been a warning sign. But did we listen? No. Our stomachs reasoned that since we were there, we might as well give it a shot, convincing us to stay.  I went ahead and ordered my Pad See Ew and what I got back was a box full of noodles drenched in fish sauce and over seasoned vegetables. The amount of sodium I consumed in one bite was enough to clog my arteries. It was preposterous. I was dumbfounded because it was obvious the chef didn't taste his creation--a very troubling habit when you're heavy handed with the fish sauce. I was appalled.   So there you have it. Take my warning and go with it. You can stay for the smells. The smells are free. But if you're thinking about placing an order, be careful as you tread these salty waters.",

    "text": "The most horrendous experience I have ever had in any type of food establishment - and I've been to countless in numerous countries, from street food and fast-food joints to Michellin-starred restaurants. I have just arrived in Edinburgh with my elderly parents, we thought this would be a nice place to grab a bit at, but my father was mistreated in the most absurd manner by the waitress (Marilyn, as per receipt) - who clearly should not be allowed to work in any environment in which there's any kind of contact with customers. She mocked my father, said he doesn't know how to speak English - not only an unacceptable thing to say, but also unTrue! He may not be fully proficient as I am (and I was there to help), but oddly enough, the waitress' English is actually much worse - not that it should matter at all, but quite interesting, considering her mockery of my dad. The waitress was incredibly impatient, rushed us to choose something within five seconds after informing us that they didn't have the lambchops my father had ordered ten minutes prior... And then she got confused with our order (not a problem, it happens), but tried to blame it on my parents, as if implying they are senile or something, asides from mocking my father's English. We cancelled the orded altogether and paid for the water that we had drank. We told the only other employee who was there, a polite waiter, about the incident, but this report seriously needs to reach the owner. This experience almost ruined the first day of our vacation, and people - especially paying customers - should not be disrespected, EVER. We are very polite people and were going to stay there for the meal despite the waitress' clear impatience, but that person clearly dislikes human beings, and the way she treated my elderly dad escalated, so we left. Simply appalling.",

My friend and I ordered the Pad Khing Chicken, Tom Yum Goong, and Chicken Fried Rice..all disappointing.  Tom Yum was flavorless, Pad Khing was overly watery and sweet (could be mistaken for a soup), and the fried rice..mushy..poorly seasoned.

They have long communal tables and are a bit like Wagamama. I was needing a quick bite to eat before heading to the Yelp Shimmy Hug evening tonight so I popped in for some soup. I had the Tom Kha traditional Thai soup with coconut soup which sounded lovely. It was really reasonable at 3.50 but it wasn't particularly coconutty and had a different, hard to place flavour of the broth. The chicken and mushrooms were ok but there were little green shoots that were fibrous and didn't seem edible or at least digestible. It wasn't to my taste. I'd perhaps come back to try the Thai green curry or noodles but it's too bad they don't seem to do lunch prices. It's more of a lunch type of place anyway and was really quiet at dinnertime.",
