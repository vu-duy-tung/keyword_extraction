The hostesses and wait staff were very nice  and cheerful even though the place was packed and people kept trying to come.  But that coffee.. Yum!",

The music not too loud or distracting, and inside smells so lovely, like baked goods and chocolate. They take card and have outlets so you can plug your devices in. The tea came in a cute little pot with milk, and the cappuccinos did not come with milk art- not an issue though. The toilet is kind of gross though, be warned.",

We asked for the breakfast pancakes that were on the blackboard but were told it would take a while accompanied by a pained look as if we were asking for something outlandish so not wanting to put them out, we settled instead for a croissant with the coffee but had to wait about 10 minutes before they brought over with the coffee. No napkin. I noticed the people on the table opposite had to get their own cutlery.   Coffee was good. Afterwards we waited a few further minutes to pay as they took the order first from someone else who stepped in front of us at the counter so didn't return the next day.",

I had the coronation chicken sandwich and a leek and potato soup (served in a large bowl) for 5.   Tasty, affordable, quick, and right off the busy Royal Mile. It has only been here for two months, but I look forward to more. Definitely will be coming back.",

Plus they have free wifi :)  The only downside is that it's a pretty small place - maybe seats around 10-15 people max.  But if you're looking to grab something and go, then it's in a great location just off the royal mile.",

    "text": "It was a bit of a mixed bag from Zebra, on my recent visit.   They've taken the smart decision to source their soups and salads from Union of Genius, so they can be relied upon to be excellent, at all times. Sadly, their sandwiches weren't up to much, and Lavazza isn't a coffee favourite, with me, so there's definitely room for improvement.  So overall, we said: \"I thought Zebra was rather smart, and has made a very wise choice in their soup stockist. They have some work to do to improve the sandwiches, though, but there's every reason to think that can be achieved. I look forward to popping in again, soon, to check on progress.\"",
