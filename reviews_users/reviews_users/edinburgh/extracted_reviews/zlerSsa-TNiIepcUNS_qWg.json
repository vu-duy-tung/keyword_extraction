The waitress was also the assistant manager, I think her name was Laura and not only was she in good spirits but also friendly and helpful.   Whenever the burgers came out I was a little unimpressed at first, however, 3/4 of the way though I was beginning to struggle! Went for the Harlem, proper pressed steak burger, slices of chorizo and a red pepper aioli - was very tasty.   Overall I would definitely visit again, great value from a Groupon deal and was an enjoyable afternoon out.",

    "text": "Stopped in here one night not long before Xmas so, with most of the place reserved for a seasonal party, maybe not a time to experience it at its best.  No issues with the service & the milkshakes were large but how can you manage to get buns that are far too big for the burger they contain? Given the number of burger places in the city nowadays that needs some working on.",

    "text": "Taking over from the Riperian Rooms on East London Street, TriBeCa have opened their second Edinburgh location (Bruntsfield) which follows three Glasgow locations.  Decent size space with downstairs serving New York diner style food from 8am-10pm (Eve menu 5-10pm) 7 days a week. I tried brunch - \"the Varick breakfast\", which is French toast, eggs as you want them, crispy bacon, sausage etc. The food is decent, served quickly with good portions. The service was efficient and friendly. I haven't been to the other locations but can see why this is a popular place. Free wi-fi.",

The waffles and chicken dish is the weirdest but most wonderful combination! The waitresses are soo helpful and you don't have to chase them down to help . Great food , great service and a lovely atmosphere . I will be back here :)",
