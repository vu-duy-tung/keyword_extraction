Free and unlimited sides were a big plus and the big platter of meat was delicious. This place was so good that I booked a reservation for the next night whilst in the restaurant!",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of Korean food and have been in too many Korean restaurants to count in many cities (Dublin, Tokyo, Osaka, Austria, London, Manchester, Seoul etc..), and this one is a definite 5 star. It was very authentic, we were also the only two non-Korean people in the entire restaurant which was full and booked out for the night.   We ordered the Kimchi pancake and tofu bibimbap, both of which tasted just like in Korea, I savoured every bite! Not all Korean restaurants outside Korea seem to give the complimentary starters, but Korean BBQ does, which was great.   The prices were standard, each main ranging around 10-12. The service was efficient and good, no complaints.   A word of warning, this place is extremely popular, even on weekdays. We came on a Saturday to find it booked out so I made a reservation the following Monday online, which was ok. While we were there, the place was a full house and the waitress was turning down those without reservations as it was booked out until around 8:30pm.   The online booking is easy and quick, it fills up fast. I booked two days in advance for a Monday night, and the latest available was 6:30pm, with nothing available any later. So I advise booking quite a bit in advance or be ready to eat either early or late, as the 7-9pm times seem to get taken fast as the restaurant is small and seems to be very popular with Koreans in Edinburgh, meaning that it must be the real thing!",

    "text": "I enjoyed eating at Korean BBQ. I'm pretty used to KBBQ joints from the ones back home in the DC area to well-known places in Seoul, and this place was pretty comparable overall!  The staff was quite nice and prompt, especially when it came to changing out the grills. The meat was good (we got 2 sets and it fed 6 people comfortably). The grills cooked the meat nicely and I love when the fat on the pork belly gets crispy. Kimchi is extra but the banchan overall was pretty good even though it's not a lot. I really liked the marinated bean sprouts!   As far as Korean BBQ goes, this is probably the best place in Edinburgh (according to my Edinburgh friends) and I can confirm it's a good place to get your fix!",

    "text": "Summary: Korean BBQ that offers the bare basics. Meat quality is meh and the lack of a fire stove makes it feel third rate.   Food: The beef is quite dry and has basically no marbling. However, the Pork belly and Chicken were quite good. Quality is subpar when compared to cult classics like KangHoDong Baekjong. It's also important to note that the stove used to bbq is electric, so don't expect the classic fire grilled flavor of Kbbq.   Pricing: The pricing is definitely more on the pricier side once you consider the quality of meat you're getting. The quantities are good, but quantity doesn't justify the higher price.    Service: The service is normal, nothing wrong but nothing spectacularly good.",

However, they told us they only accept cash and told us to withdraw at a nearby ATM after we are done with the meal. They didn't apologize or explain why, but repeatedly saying \"CASH ONLY\" even we told them there is going to be an expensive service fee if we use ATM.   We are very disappointed at their attitude. It is literally CHEATING customers and violating VISA regulation. Plus, we felt they only did it because we are Asians and speaking Mandarin. Sad. Disappointed.",

    "text": "*Disclaimer! I'm Korean from Hawaii, lived all over the world and eat Korean food in every city I visit. My tastes probably differ from the average person who doesn't go out of their way to find good korean joints.   !! So this is the top rated place for Korean food in Edinburgh...the set up is nice but the staff isn't as friendly as other places we've been. Upon walking in we first notice the aroma...so far so good! The waitress is Chinese (not that it matters), so don't be surprised if you don't get the normal \"hello!\" when walking in. Banchan () was ok, and more limited than when I'm used to back in the states -3 instead of 6 or 7 types.  The traditional cabbage kim chee is a menu item and you have to pay for it. The mandu  options were veggie or chicken...no pork?! Still yummy even if it wasn't the normal pork but they seemed to be store bought and not home made.   Our drinks came out after 10 mins (just water and tea folks) the banchan. The meat itself looked good - we got the normal gal-bi and after cooking it on our little hibachi grill tasted the closest I've ever eaten outside of Hawaii that tasted like local Korean BBQ. The dolsot bi-bim-bap was spot on too and I liked how they put the shredded daikon kimchee in it. Oh, and it had a lot of beef in it too! This is in my top 5 of best korean food I've ever had - worldwide (Hawaii, Cali, VA and S. Korea food is better!)  BLUF: Eat here if you want delicious Korean BBQ in Edinburgh. They offer the basics in what you'd see in S.Korea and Japan, but fall short of the extensive menu's I'm used to in Cali and Hawaii.",
