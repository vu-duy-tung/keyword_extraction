Every dish I tried was remarkable, so much so that I was happy to wait for a table to open the following night so that I could try a whole new set of dishes and drinks, which once again, were fabulous! On top of it all, our waitress Niki, was MORE then fantastic.. she provided my travel mates and I different spots we would should check out around Scotland on our travels and we had an incredible time.. my recommendations... don't think.. just go... I don't care if you have to wait an hour to get seated.. just go downstairs to the bar and have fabulous drinks...try the chicken ruby and chocolate pudding... and feel transported to Bombay! Thanks so much Niki!",

This is a good place to share dishes.  On the pricier side for the younger crowd so it keeps out teenage tourists and brings in the Edinburgh crowd.",

    "text": "I would give this restaurant 10 stars if I could! I visited during their 'soft launch' which gave us 50% of ALL FOOD AND DRINK - no exceptions. We went on a busy Saturday night and had to queue outside for a while, it wasn't too cold and the atmosphere was friendly so it wasn't as bad as it sounds. The hostesses also came round with little glasses of sherry and chai tea to keep us going.   Once we got inside we were told to make our way downstairs to The Permit Room where we could have a few drinks while we waited on our table. When we got downstairs we felt we had been transported back in time to 1950s India, the decor and atmosphere was amazing. We were greeted again by a host who told us that because of the waiting times our first drink was on the house - result! I had the Pila House Sling and my boyfriend had Viceroy's Old Fashioned. The cocktails have very different flavours to traditional ones but they're delicious.   When our table was finally ready, we travelled up in a little lift to the top floor where the restaurant was located. Again, the decor was very traditional and the whole room was alive with people chatting and eating - a great Saturday night buzz! The menu is kind of like tapas so we choose a few dishes to share between us. We opted for the lamb samosas, keema pau, calamari, chicken tikka and lamb biryani. Everything was delicious but the calamari was the standout for me and one I would definitely order again.   Overall, this restaurant is quite different to typical Indian food you would get in Edinburgh. The cocktails, food and service is exceptional and even though we got 50% off the bill the full price menu is still reasonable. Would definitely recommend.",

They told us it may be an hour or hour and a half but \"probably much sooner so go downstairs and get yourself a drink \". One and a half hours later, we were still waiting on a table. Drinks were weak and alcohol poured stingily (word?). It just wasn't that busy to justify the wait. 2 tables on either side of use were empty when we were seated. See pics. Service was slow and badly timed. Food was spicy as expected and generally good but overly salted. Had to ask for dessert menus several times. Prices were reasonable.",

Food was outstanding. Staff outstanding.. the manger took time out to have a chat and recommended what dips to use with the foods, the young girl serving was very helpful and honest, best restaurant experience in the city of Edinburgh over the last 3 days.

I was nervous as I was traveling solo and had been warned they don't take reservations.  The bar is downstairs and is primarily reserved from those parties waiting for a table so I knew this wouldn't be an option.  I arrived at quarter past eight, and was easily sat at the breakfast bar on the main level.  While I missed out on the atmosphere, I was able to people watch the pedestrians walking by and was happy to try the food.  I took the waiter's recommendation - and started with the calamari and naan and I was happy I did.  Both were excellent, and I know that is odd to describe naan as excellent, but the flavors were great!!  I then had the chef's special \"Sale Boti.\"  I was hungry so I did the whole and was happy I did.  While I am not a spicy girl, the spices definitely created some sweat pebbles on my forehead and I didn't mind!  I end with a chai.. You must end with a chai....  I took the train to London for a weekend of theater and while there a friend asked if I wanted Indian, as he knew the best place in town.  I giggled to myself and said \"Dishoom?\"  Of course, I was right!!",

The chefs circled everything on the menu that was allergy friendly and everything they could make allergy friendly! For example, mango lassi is always with dairy yogurt. They made it for my son with coconut yogurt instead, and they even said it was a first time making it like that but they were happy to try out something new.

    "text": "On a recent visit to Edinburgh, I heard that one of my favorite Indian places from London has now a branch here too. It is an Iranian cafe from Mumbai, India. I knew I had to try it. It is in St. Andrews Square overlooking the park - lovely location and is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. There are so many items on the menu that everyone can find something to their liking no matter what time of the day. The entrance has a Ganesh statue welcoming you. They do not take reservations for parties under six and have bar seating on the 1st floor level as well as an upstairs room and seating in the basement too. I ate upstairs which with its huge windows has plenty of light   filtering in, has a bar area and plenty of seating available. It was loud and vibrant inside as the place was very busy but wasn't disturbing at all. The furniture has the aged and antique look which contrasts well with some modern decorations - giving it a very warm and inviting look. The walls are covered with photos of owner's ancestors - mostly in black and white and several sayings in Hindi - very interesting decor. The food is delicious, cooked to perfection with the right amount of spice. Tried several dishes starting with the okra fries, ruby chicken, garlic naan and their special on their menu - sali boti. Ruby chicken is like spicy butter chicken - was so soft and perfectly cooked.  Sali boti was lamb curry topped with crunchy potato sticks and was served with roomali roti - had option of half or full plate. Lamb is not easy to cook - compared to many other good places this one is by far one of the best I've tasted. They served the food with a trio condiment consisting of mint, sweet tamarind and spicy sauce. For desserts, we tried their malai kulfi which was served on sticks and their chocolate pudding which comes with spicy ice cream. They give you a choice of cinnamon ice cream too. Food was very authentic and service was great. It was served quickly as well. Ultimately, it's the food quality, presentation and experience which makes the restaurant stand out and this one meets on all counts.  A must visit and highly recommended - 5 stars on all counts.",

The Bombay Omelet at Dishoom transports my wife back home when her grandmother made Sunday omelettes with the same spices and ingredients.  The Breakfast Naan Rolls are really big for the price.  I recommend going for the bottomless chai tea.  Breakfast is pretty reasonably priced at less than 20 pounds for 2 people including tea.    You really need reservations for dinner here as it gets busy at night.",

    "text": "GREAT Indian food. When we arrived at ~6:30pm, there was already a line out the door, which the waiter told us would be approximately a 45 minute wait. (We tried making a reservation for a group of 4, but reservations are only available to groups of 6+.) The wait outside passed by pretty quickly - a waiter even brought us hot tea twice! After we made it in, we were given a buzzer to wait in the bar area, and were given a table in the bar area in 10 or so minutes. We had enough time to finish one drink before being seated. I got the virgin colada which was just the right amount of sweet and came with coconut flakes.   As for the actual meal, my table ordered veggie samosas, two servings of garlic naan with butter, Awadhi lamb biryani, chicken ruby, and a half plate of the chef's special (spicy lamb and fried naan). The food was AMAZING. However, the servings were smaller than expected, so we ended up SCRAPING our plates clean. This last morsel of unsatisfied hunger is the only reason to my missing final star - otherwise, truly a stellar dining experience even with the wait.",

The food isn't what you'd find in your local Indian (Bangladeshi) restaurant- there's no tikka masala or korma, this is the kind of street food you'd find on the streets of India.  The black daal was lovely, a perfect balance of spice & flavour. The chicken thighs & fish from the grill were tender & had a lovely flavour.  Despite being busy the service was attentive & professional. The spiced chai cider is worth a try if you fancy something other than beer",

This is the only restaurant in the whole city where people actually queue to eat there.  I wouldn't say this place is a traditional Indian restaurant, especially considering the price, but it's still delicious.  The only thing we weren't huge fans of was the grilled lamb kebab.

I did not have a reservation so the hostess said it was a 30 minute wait. However, the patio seating had no wait. I jumped on that opportunity and happily took the patio seat with the hope that it won't rain. The hostess offered me a hot tea to keep me warm and it was refreshing to have that kind of politeness and warmth in terms of customer service in UK. Shortly, a spot at the bar inside opened up and she helped me move there. I went for a simple food in terms of my order and got the daal, rice and fried okhra. The fried okra was amazing and really completed my meal with the dal rice. The daal was rich and slightly tangy. They kept checking on me regularly during the meal and made sure I was comfortable ( I had lots of bags with me and I was trying to place them safely). I would like to definitely come back and have other dishes...if only I lived in Edinburgh !",

Also note that this place isn't spicy AT ALL for my Indian taste buds. Keep that in mind when ordering  We were a group of four, and ordered bunch of things in menu  Egg naan roll: 4/5. Naan's bit thick and chewy for a roll. But once you reach the stuffing it tasted pretty good. But on sweeter side though  Okra fries:4.5/5. Almost perfect except for the fat which were less crispy inside  Kheema pav: 5/5. Favorite dish of the day. Kheema was great and the bun was nice and soft  Mango lassi: 5/5. Not too sweet and not too cold. Just perfect  Chai paanch: 5/5. A scotch cocktail with chai flavor. That's 2 drinks I like in one :) It was smooth and bit sweet  Lamb biryani: 4/5. I'm a Hyderabadi, and I'm particular about my biryani. Wasn't as favorful as I would like  Black dal with roomali roti: 3.5/5. I liked their dal when I tried it in London, but not much this time here. It was too creamy for a dal.  Malai kulfi: 5/5. Very sweet. And tasted like back home",

Luckily, we perused Yelp Scotland and saw one a short walk from our hotel. YES.   We arrived around 7:00 p.m. and were quoted a 70 minute wait for a party of 2. No biggie, because there is an amazing bar downstairs to hang out at while waiting for a table. The downstairs bar smelled of incense and had a great selection of cocktails and bar snacks that transfer to your table tab. The Chaijito (think Indian mojito) and Mulled Bramble hit the spot. The potato crisps were great to munch on while waiting. Fortunately, we only waited about 30 minutes before being seated.   The food was absolutely delicious! Some of the best Indian I've ever had. The vegetable samosas were piping hot and generously filled with peas, carrots, and potatoes. I highly recommend the Black Daal-- so flavorful! The Raita and Garlic Naan helped to cool off the spicy daal and Chicken Tikka.   The service and ambiance were also great. I highly recommend Dishoom and would love to visit again!",

I was in Edinburgh twice in one week and both times I went to Dishoom because it was so good.   Fried Green Chilies...if you like spicy, these are delicious.  Lightly breaded and fried to perfection.  Chole Puri, (Fried Puris puffed with spiced Chickpeas).  Spicy and savory.   A wonderful dish.  Chicken Ruby.  It's Chicken Tikka Masala.  Very delicious.  Garlic Naan.  House Black Daal.  Dishoom's signature dish.  These are Lentils slowly cooked in a mixture of spices.  They are fantastic.  We spent a little bit of time in the Bar downstairs waiting for a table on my second visit.  It is a nice set up and a great place to spend time while you wait for your table.  If you like Indian, don't miss Dishoom!",

So, when I arrived in Edinburgh by bus around 7am, I waited until Dishoom opened at 8am to grab breakfast, and it was so worth.  I ordered the Bacon Naan Roll and loved it. I didn't expect this combination of ingredients would go so well together.  Dishoom's House Chai is also a must! You also get free refills!! I noticed a few locals who brought there work with them so they could enjoy the Chai at Dishoom, and I would too if I lived in Edinburgh.  I really can't think of anything I didn't like about Dishoom. The food was amazing and very affordable. The service was great. And I loved the interior. I hope to return to a Dishoom soon and try other items on their menu.  --  taste / 5 aesthetics / 5 vibe / 5 service / 5 price for quality / 5 OVERALL / 5",

    "text": "I've heard so many wonderful things about Dishoom, both in Edinburgh and London that I was absolutely dying to try this place out! I was not disappointed in the food at all! It was very rich and hearty and does not feel like a commercialized attempt at authentic Indian cuisine - although there are quite a few \"modern\" twist to Indian dishes. I decided to stick to what I knew I could judge and ordered the chicken tikka, the chicken ruby (basically chicken tikka masala) with regular naan. There was a seasonal side dish of a small lamb chop that I ordered as well. The food was incredible fresh and delicious, however the food is quite overpriced given the restaurant's location and popularity. The waiter said the entrees were meant to be shared and that is why it was a little pricier, however it was only the right amount of food for just one person. The 3 chutneys were so flavorful and one quite spicy, it really elevated the taste of all of the food. Overall the restaurant has a great ambiance but be prepared to wait in line outside if you go during peak hours.",

From the moment you walk in you are made aware of the class and style Dishoom has to offer. Very professional yet nice staff. The bartenders that made our drinks while we waited for our table were both very sweet and creative. Though it was extremely busy but still they carefully listened to what we would like to drink and crafted the drinks perfectly to our tastes.  It's a fusion restaurant and that's made very clear in every aspect of Dishoom. From the decor to cocktails to table ware and serving dishes, everything is clearly chosen to reflect traditional Mumbai Indian culture yet mixed beautifully with contemporary style.  Food recommendations; Chicken Baryani, Chicken ruby, and don't miss out the amazingly scrumptious Kali/Black daal.  Of course the meal wasn't complete without the delicious malai kulfi and chai.  They don't accept reservations but it's completely worth the wait.  Really wish they opened a branch here is US.",

We happened upon Dishoom and from the moment we walked in the door, knew we were in for a great meal.  Dishoom is a bit trendy Indian style food, and served as one would receive street food in India.  There was no place for waiting so the staff asked us if we would like to wait in the bar.  Of course we would!  We waited some time, which I forgot about because the drinks and appetizers at the bar had me completely distracted.  Also, they had toys for kids, which kept me and the little girl occupied and lost in fun.  Who can resist Etch a Sketch?  I must admit it is seldom that I lose track of time while waiting in a restaurant, but Dishoom got me!    All too soon the server came to collect us and get us all sorted out.  We went up to the restaurant and boy did we have a great meal! I mean it was indescribable how the flavors burst forth in my mouth! Bite after bite and dish after dish I was happily shocked! I didn't know Indian food could be this amazing, and I really love Indian food.    Some people said it is actually Iranian food, from Mumbai, or maybe it is a fusion, in any event, it is fantastic!  For us, there will be another trip to Scotland, and therefore certainly another trip to Dishoom!  It is a repeat for certain.  I can't recommend it highly enough.",

Good breakfasts with an Indian twist.  Had the spicy chicken liver dish. Was good! Also had the big Bombay, basically an Indianized English breakfast. Normal sausage and bacon. Masala beans and the eggs were good. Overall it was OK but I would have chosen something else to try something different.    They put coriander on everything which was great if you like coriander.",

The Edinburgh chef's special was also very good and roti was thin and buttery (or greasy depending on how you look at it).  Would definitely come back or check out their other locations!",

First, I should say I am not a fan of Indian food.  I took a chance upon a suggestion from a trusted friend that the food here was amazing, and it turned out to be True.    Dishes I had included the Vegetable Samosas, Keema Pau, Murgh Malai, Chicken Ruby, Bowl Of Greens, and the Gulab Jamun for dessert.   The star of the meal was the Chicken Ruby, WOW.  I pretty much licked the bowl it was so good.  Of the starters I preferred the Keema Pau over the Vegetable Samosas mostly because I prefer non-dough sort of foods.    While I loved the mains and starters, the dessert selection (i.e. puddings) wasn't really for me. The one I did try (Gulab Jamun) was very well made, I just didn't care for it but it did have good quality ingredients like all the other dishes.   The prices are reasonable, the food is great. Don't hesitate to give this a try.",

Over our two meals we tried:   Chicken biryani (this was the absolute best - we got it both nights and basically came back for this) Chicken Ruby (delicious, and tender) Sali Boti (half plate) (very good! Half plate was enough for trying it) Okra fries (yummy! and fun) Lamb boti kebab (bit dry, but good with the black daal) Black daal (solid, but unmemorable) Pau Bhaji (prob our least favorite - we did not finish it) Butter bhutta (corn) (reminds me of the street corn of Taiwan, and elote) Garlic naan Chili cheese toast Rose lassi, house chai  As always, the atmosphere is the best part about this place with such keen attention to detail with the decor. They only take reservations up to 5:45 for what is technically lunch. And we did also learn that refills on the house chai only goes until 5pm (which is an odd rule tbh). Really recommend trying Dishoom at least once!",

It's very savory and creamy like a Tikka Masala but has a unique flavor that I couldn't quite place that gives it a very special taste. They also have a Dishoom IPA which comes from a microbrewery in the UK and is specially made for them and it is so, so crisp and satisfying. Love, love, love this place!",

Easily the best Indian food I have ever had.  Easily.   I also appreciated that place was not kitschy with junk, but there were clues around you were in an Indian restaurant.   We waited about 1/2 hour in the line outside to get into the bar.  The whole time the staff was bringing us little hot drinks to make sure we were comfortable while we waited (was a bit cold).  Is was another 1/2 hour or 40 minutes to get sat, but the bar was very nice and we enjoyed the bartender quite a lot.  Well worth the wait.",

Because there was so much hype around this restaurant I was afraid it would disappoint, but luckily it did not! All the food we received was truly delicious. The black Daal being my favorite item. I'm already looking forward to their cookbook coming out in the next couple of months. If heading to Edinburgh, do yourself a favor and make a reservation at Dishoom. You won't regret it!",

Fortunately we were able to get a table at the Edinburgh location. This restaurant does not disappoint. We were seated immediately when we arrived a bit after 5:00. The host was very friendly, as was our server. The establishment is quite large with both a basement seating area, a few bar seats in the ground floor, and an upstairs dining room, where we sat. The upstairs level has a gorgeous view of St. Andrew Square. I started the meal with a lovely glass of Spumante and some okra fries and fried prawns with various chutneys, which were delicious, though somewhat spicy, so be aware of that. For the main course I ordered the chicken tikka with jasmine rice and a side of broccoli with green beans and kale. The chicken was delicious., and the vegetables were wonderful; I've actually never had vegetables with Indian spices like that before and found that it really works. By the time we left, which was around 6:30, the place had started to fill up, but there was still no line st the door (in contrast to the Covent Garden location in London, where there was a serious line out the door around 9:00 pm). Very happy I got a chance to try Dishoom.",

So when the one in Edinburgh was only 1:15 hours we decided to wait it out.  And it was definitely worth it.  In fact we cane back the next night and waited again.   The staff here is incredible and if you're waiting outside will give you some warm tea.  While waiting inside at the bar they will get your drink order and transfer the tab to you dinner which is wonderful.   For the food if you go with a group definitely try to share and get a taste of the different dishes.  My first night I had the Chicken Ruby - similar to chicken tikka masala.  The chicken was so tender and the sauce very taste and spiced perfectly.  If you did want it hotter they had a chili sauce on the table to add some heat.  The second night I got the. Chili chicken (technically a small plate) nd added rice.  It was good as well. Also I tasted the sheekh kabob and chef special salli boti and both great. I never tasted anything there I didn't like.   As for the service.  That is freaking amazing.  The first night everyone was wonder and very attentive. The second night in line we were recognized as being the the previous night and everyone who talked to us acknowledged us being there again. Then our waiter (a different server from the previous night) told us what we had the night before and recommend different things so we could get the full experience.  However they stored that information is incredible because we never have a surname. You must go but be prepared for a wait in line.",

Almost daily :P  Everything about this place is a full full 5 star. The service, the food, the ambience. The ambience is so full of life, I went for breakfast, a late lunch and dinner, so you see I saw all the seasons before I am making the statement :). The waiters know all about the menu and help you if you have any questions. If you are going for dinner after 7pm it is better to book a table in advance. The wait maybe really long!   Here are my Dishoom favorites - chole puri, pau bhaji ( just like those street chaat vendors) house black dal ( creamy, and most comforting ) the house chai ( its bottomless, you can't just have one glass), okra fries, vada pau, malai kulfi, kejriwal and naan egg roll ( breakfast menu)  We were a large party for the dinner trip to Dishoom and here are some of the favorites from my non veggie members -lamb chops, sheekh kabab and all the varieties of naan.  The decor definitely took me back to my days in Bombay in those Parsi cafes. Especially during breakfast time I could see so many people ordering their dish and a chai and spending some alone time!   There is nothing about this restaurant that deserves anything less than 5 stars. If you are in UK and love Indian food please make a reservation and go here.",

It's a lively restaurant with the kitchen slinging out tasty fresh dishes lightning fast. Also the prices are somehow absurdly reasonable, offering an additional incentive to visit if tasty Indian food isn't enough on its own. It's the kind of place where you share everything and can order anything.   Definitely go for an order or two of the ruby chicken, which is similar to butter chicken but more savory than sweet, the chicken biryani has some lovely grill flavor to it as does the side of corn which is seasoned beautifully, the samosas each have a perfect pastry-to-filling ratio and aren't oily at all, the garlic naan is crispy like a flatbread but also somehow has some lovely fluffiness to it.   Oh and maybe most importantly, the meals are actually spicy! For an American who always orders Indian food spicy and it is still quite bland, this place does it effortlessly and consistently for every dish, without you needing to request it. Such a refreshing change of pace.",

    "text": "You already know this is an amazing restaurant but if it's your first time, what should you order?   We had lunch & breakfast here (on two separate days) and the following are some highlights about the dishes we tried...  Lunch  1. PAU BHAJI (4.5) - this dish was just like how my husbands grandmother (who lived in pre-colonial India) made it. From the flavour to the texture it was exactly how he remembered it. Personally, I prefer my potatoes a little chunky but I appreciated the smooth texture & the warm buttered buns complimented the dish very well.   2. SALLI BOTI (5/5)- tender lamb in an onion, tomato, spicy curry/salan with salli (thin potato crisps) on top. Full of both familiar & distinct flavors, this dish was incredible. A half order was perfect for two. Served with the perfect amount of naan.  3. MURGH MALAI (5/5) - perfect. Tender, nice charred bits on the edges, juicy, flavorful. Not spicy but this dish is not meant to be.   4. Chocolate pudding with chili ice cream - (4/5) - the chocolate was rich and delicious. The ice cream had a mild kick of chili at the end. Overall, a fun combination.   Breakfast  1. CHAI - if you're going to enjoy a South Asian breakfast, chai is a must.   2. AKURI (4/5) - the roasted tomato & warm buttery buns were a nice addition to this egg dish. The scrambled eggs were good, authentic to the time period they were replicating but not our favorite style.   3. EGG NAAN ROLL (4.5/5) - delicious fluffy/crispy naan & a perfect runny yolk. This was delicious. I wish there was more tomato chili jam evenly spread throughout the naan. Overall, very satisfying and the chutney was fantastic.  4. VEGAN SAUSAGE(4/5) - your standard vegan sausage with very mild spices. Was a good addition to our meal (I added mine into the egg naan roll)   You don't typically come across a huge range of breakfast items at South Asian restaurants so the variety in the menu was refreshing.   Heard great things about the Ruby Chicken, Lamb Shoulder & okra fries and will have to try those next time.",

    "text": "Oh, Dishoom.  It's renowned for a good reason. The food is delectable, the drinks are all good, the service is precise, the ambiance is wonderful. Transplanted here from the ever-popular London locations, Dishoom Edinburgh has all the quality of London with the prospect of a semi-reasonable wait. You should still expect to wait about 30 min, especially for dinner, but getting an amazing cocktail in the downstairs bar, \"The Permit Room,\" is part of the process.   You really can't go wrong here.. but let me point out some favorites to steer you well. The Edinburgh house special (this location only) is Salli Boti - an amazing and rich dish showcasing Scottish lamb and served with gravy, crispy bits, and a very delicate roti. Other notables for me are the Pau Bhaji, Mattar Paneer, and Chole Puri. All delicious. For dessert, I quite like their Gulab Jamun! I would stay clear of the Kala Ice though... it's weird.   They also have a separate breakfast menu which looks fantastic and a breakfast loyalty program (several visits - a free Roti wrap). Anyway, it's a great place, perfect for a nicer dinner or special occasion, and I highly recommend a visit!",

Dishoom had a fun atmosphere, convenient location (a 2 minute walk from the train), and given I was a solo dinner they sat me right away on a Friday night.   I appreciated the menu identifying vegan items, and the waiter explaining which things were more tasty made vegetarian (bring on the butter baby!). I would've tried more dishes, but a solo vacation often prohibits that.   I will be heading back next time I'm in Edinburgh.",

    "text": "SIMPLY WONDERFUL!!!  I was visiting Edinburgh for 4 nights and ended up dining here 2x--once for breakfast and once for dinner. Both visits were eye-opening experiences, but I would have to say there's a lot more value with breakfast--mainly bc of the 'bottomless' house chai (holy!!!) and bacon naan roll (cow!!!). We also got the bottomless date & banana porridge but it wasn't as special as the other two.   For dinner, we got the Chicken Ruby, Mahi Tikka, House Black Daal, Garlic Naan, Dishoom IPA, and House Chai. Phenomenal flavors for the Chicken Ruby, House Black Daal, and Garlic Naan.   It was an absolute pleasure dining at Dishoom's 5th and newest location. Definitely a MUST TRY if you're ever in Edinburgh (or London, 4 locations). Thank you for, hands down, the most exquisite Indian meal in my life! Cheers!",

Apparently this is Dishoom's fifth location with the other four being smashing hits in London. I'm grateful we were able to visit for an Indian breakfast and sample some of their most popular dishes whilst soaking in the views of Andrew's Square and the park.   For starters, the interior is beautiful (don't miss the bathrooms on the lower level). We chose to soak in the sunshine on the front patio since the weather was so nice. My order consisted of the breakfast lassi with mangos, bananas and granola, the bacon naan, masala beans and bottomless chai. I especially enjoyed the lassi, beans and chai. Despite the bacon naan being one of their most popular items, it wasn't one of my favorites. The chai was delightful and the lassi was both refreshing and not too sweet. I'd love to visit again experience their other menus. Highly recommend for a colorful and flavor-packed meal.",

We were advised so that we didn't over order as they knew how big the portions would be.... what's more as a lovely treat the head server gave us our first drinks free ?? Which was very generous... I would recommend the Bollywood Bellenis they were delicious... would definitely go back there ....",

The cocktails are also superb, although they use low grade liquor which is a bit of a bummer if you're looking for a simple, nice gin or other spirit.   We were able to walk in on a week night - I believe it was a Tuesday - and this place was popping. They gave us a pager and sent us to the bar below the restaurant which was also buzzing. We shut the place down (which we did at most places in Scotland) so if you're looking for a nice long meal, this is the place to do it but come earlier than 8pm.   The staff was incredible and I felt well taken care of here. The atmosphere was rich and the food delicious. We ordered way too much, but everything was worth trying a bit of. I would come here for every special meal if I could, or even just a in night out with friends.   Ahh Dishoom. How I love you.",

We loved the cocktails and food so much we visited another location for a second meal within a week. We were in Edinburgh to find a venue for our wedding. Our wedding planner suggested this great spot for breakfast over in New Town. \"It is called Dishoom, have you heard of it?\" We instantly made heart eyes at each other, made a note to find it and eat it asap.   We arrived around 630pm expecting a wait. Thankfully, we were brought right in and got a table immediately. Our server was incredibly nice and suggested a few cocktails. I ordered the Tehmuls Tangle while chuck got the old fashioned house cocktail. Both were delicious. We knew that we wanted to share so we grabbed two appetizers, chili chicken and chili cheese toast, an order of chicken ruby, rice and two garlic naan. Everything was delightful! The heat on the chicken appetizer was mildly hot. The ruby was also spicy but not very strong (especially after the chili chicken). The garlic naan, as always, was amazing to scoop up the sauces. After all that food, we got the dessert cocktails. One was an espresso martini and the other was a chai tea ice cream covered in liquors. The staff there were all so kind. Everyone from the serving manager (SO FRIENDLY) to the bar guys dropping the cocktails (actively interested in what we liked about our cocktails). By the time we left an hour and a half later, there was a waitlist building. If it is anything like the london branches, there will be a 2 hour wait shortly after and for good reason.  Next time we are definitely coming for breakfast, which sounds amazing, and another dinner or three. COME TO NYC, DISHOOM! You'd make a fortune off of me alone.",

On day 2, we were browsing restaurants on Yelp when Dishoom popped up!!! We had no idea it was here!  Score.   We popped in for a late lunch, and were seated right away. The server, Richard, was insanely helpful in walking us through the menu. He also suggested the Viceroy old fashioned served in a peg (pictured below) and aged. To. Perfection.

I got a chai (bottomless) and a bacon egg naan roll.  The naan roll was absolutely delicious.  I am pregnant thus not drinking, but I can tell the naan roll would make the perfect hangover breakfast.  The egg was runny, the bread was crisp, and the sweet chutney dipping sauce was delicious.  Hard to imagine how I'd want to order anything else for breakfast at Dishoom again.  I found the chai a little average for something so hyped, and they were fairly slow bringing it in the first place (food came before my chai or my husband's coffee) and bringing refills, and the bill, but I was so happily full of bacon and egg naan roll I didn't even care.  I find their brunch prices to be a real bargain as well - you get stuffed on gourmet spicy deliciousness for not much money.",
