    "text": "Yeni's is a real diamond in Edinburgh's food scene. The service is wonderful and the food is sublime!!  I come here with my mum whenever she visits as it's her all time favourite. We order practically everything on the menu and savour every morsel (and this is a woman who is the epitome of self restraint when it comes to food). You never feel rushed so you can sit back and wade through the delectable assortment of dishes at your own pace, and it's all served with piping hot pitta bread to mop up the scrumptious juices. My personal favourites are the meze sausage, calamari, mixed roast vegetables and the lamb kebabs with that authentic Turkish rice that takes me back to a particularly magnificent holiday in Istanbul. Finished off with their Baklava and a cup of steaming apple tea. Perfection.  Give Yeni's a try, you will not be disappointed.  Lauren x",

    "text": "I LOVE Yeni's. It's a go-to lunch choice with their bargain of 3 tapas dishes for 10.50. The decor on the inside is subtle and stylish, the colourful posters and shelves with vintage Turkish crockery brighten the space. The food is flavoursome and fresh, while the service is quick and friendly. I go to Yeni's with my friends and my family, everyone is catered for with the inclusion of vegetarian, vegan, dairy-free and gluten-free options.  The dishes are extremely reasonable in price, and midday is always quiet, if not completely deserted! Of course, dinnertime is busier if you're looking for more of an atmosphere. Lunchtime, however, is my favourite time for Yeni's. The deserts are absolutely delicious, the ice cream flavours are unique and garnished with fresh mint. Yeni's is located centrally, with excellent transport options. I have to say, I love a bit of Yeni's.",

The food was okay - nothing particularly spectacular & thus we're unlikely to return.",

    "text": "Minimalistic, like Jenny L said, perhaps lacking in personality, but then I came here for the food so decided to overlook this minor detail... The location is good, just off the hustle and bustle of Princes Street so a good option for local and tourists alike.    I came in yesterday for the 9.95 lunch mezze deal. My partner and I naively ordered almost the same things and ended up with way too much hummus and falafel and not enough in the way of vegetables. There was plenty of pita bread (served warm) and the mixed mediterranean vegetables with yogurt were pretty tasty. The food was fine but for me personally really lacked garlic and seasoning. The hummus was creamy and fresh-tasting but pretty bland. The price was fine given the portions but I left feeling a little unsatisfied by the flavours.  Given the variety in Edinburgh I would probably not return here in a hurry to give it a second chance.",

    "text": "Ah tapas. Loads and loads of tiny food. My favourite things. Pretty much always experiencing 'food envy' every time I eat out as I find it impossible to choose just one dish from a menu, tapas is the perfect remedy to tackle this. I'd never tried Greek tapas before, so this was a pleasant first.   Dining on a Saturday evening at 5:30, our party of 10 made good use of the excellent pre theatre option - three tapas plus dessert for 14.95. I however chose from the a la carte as I absolutely had to choose the grilled halloumi, which was not on the pre theatre menu. I also close the hummus kavurma (with lamb) which was absolutely amazing! What's more, baskets of hot pitta bread is complimentary, so there are no more hidden costs. My dish however (falafel) was disappointing; very dry and there wasn't much taste at all.   We also ordered the prosecco at 21 which was superb as well as reasonably priced.   There is so much more I'd love to try on the menu so I will definitely keep this one in mind next time I visit the capital.",

    "text": "I used to enjoy the odd trip to Nargile, but it's replacement, Yeni, is a fine choice. If you check out Jen Y.'s review, it looks like the restaurant is one and the same, but rebranded. We had the pre-theatre menu and were spoiled for choice. From light spinach filo cigarello rolls, to some darn tasty shakshuka (a Catriona C. favourite), vegetables in garlic yoghurt sauce to baked falafel. With an accompanying plate of pita, we struggled to finish our main, let alone finish up with dessert. I'd definitely return for seconds though.",

    "text": "Set off on a sunny Monday evening with an itison voucher in hand to give this place a whirl and we werent disappointed. On a arrival we were greeted by a very friendly waitress and the place itself was bright and modern. The menu for the voucher was similair to the main menu only excluding the mini mains, so I cannot comment on those.   We opted for:  Cold meze  humus, Shaksuka, Dolma, olives  Hot Meze  Calamari, Sucuk, Spinach Borek  Nerellom Ascalese Arpeggio Sicilian wine  Everything was really nice and the wine was reasonably priced. The stand out dishes that made us discuss a repeat visit were the calamari, humus, Shaksuka and Sucuk. Even the pita breads were really good. Wish I had taken some photos as everything was reallly nicely presented.   Could not fault a dish from the hummous to the pitta breads, which normlly for me in meze/tapas etc theres something that is a bit weird or seems have come from a tin. Never a fan of eating anywhere around George Street as I seem to have had a lot of medicore and occassionally expensive meals, but this place is great.",

    "text": "Meze Me Full and Call Me Ikram  This place is great, really, really good Turkish food, at a great price with top notch service. We got booked in over the weekend of the Calcutta Cup, a table for 4 is hard to come by on those weekends- and my mum managed to book it on the day!  A few drinks beforehand in one of the many awesome bars on Hannover Street, and empty tummies were in need of satisfaction. Friendly welcome, don't be put off by the guy at the door handing our Hummus Canapes, it's not a sign of desperation as the place was half full and there were a lot of regulars.   The menu is huge, so we were quite relieved when the lady came over and said that they do 'set menu' for 20 a head and bring over a selection of stuff - which is taking the pain out of group eating in a Meze restaurant - ok we will take 4 of those, and 2 bottles of red wine thanks.   The cold stuff came super quick, plenty of warm pitta bread to mop up copious amounts of hummus, sliced sausage, aubergine and tomato and other dishes which I can't remember. Hot stuff started coming before we were done there, with calamari, chicken, feta and spinach pastries and hot vegetable dishes also. I know what most of these are called in Greek, but not in Turkish, sorry  The finale was the main course, and we got a platter of succulent chicken kebabs, as well as a huge pitta stuffed with freshly cooked lamb - that really was 10 out of 10.  Ok, so why isn't this 5 star, because it wasn't the most amazing Mediterranean food I have ever it had, its strong 4 star, with definite 5 star elements. My dad started speaking nonsense to the manager who gave him a voucher for a comp bottle of wine next time we are in - thanks Dad, seeing as you live in Aberdeen, I'll be taking that.  Boom!",

    "text": "We booked a table on a voucher for 2 people and they were happy to use the voucher for 4 people. The deal was for 12 'tasting sizes' containing of 6 cold and 6 warm Meze.  In addition we ordered extra fried calamari, tzaziki and an artichoke with dry roasted tomatoes.  It was all a bit of a mixed bag as each one of us preferred different dishes.  My personal favourite was the calamari, which was nicely crispy outside and soft on the inside (and not chewy like you get in some other places).   The ambiance is a bit bare, but the music created a great compensation for that. We noticed that we were humming along while enjoying the dishes in front. There is a good level of noise as we didn't have to over shout the music either.   Service was very friendly, but a little chaotic. It took us 3 requests to actually get the bill to our table. They closed the kitchen at 9pm so we decided to have coffee and dessert elsewhere.  That was actually fine with me as I didn't fancy any of the dessert on the menu.   So in all it was a good experience and there were some definite highlights, but it lacked that cohesion and finesse to make it stand out.",

The bruschetta was excellent as were the traditional Turkish dishes like hummus and grilled strips of cheese (i forget the name). The service was excellent and the prices low!  This was the best meal we've had in Edinburgh. Don't miss it",

The meze menu is full of delicious items. All the ones I've tried have been great. I've particularly enjoyed the Humus Kavurma (humus with lamb), Halloumi, and Dolma. As a group, we got the fix-price option. They assured us we would not be hungry by the end and they were right! The Iskander was absolutely fabulous.",
