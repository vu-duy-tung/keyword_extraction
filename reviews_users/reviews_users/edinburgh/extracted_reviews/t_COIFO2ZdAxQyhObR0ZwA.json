    "text": "Let's not mess about here anybody who can convince me to spend 20 on marshmallows by taste alone is some kind of wizard. I've tried pretty much all the flavours on the menu but I will show some restraint and share just my favourite two with you here.  1. Key Lime Pie Marshmallows. They are like crack. Soft, sweet and zingy clouds of marshmallowy crack.   2. Maple Bacon Marshmallows. Maple Bacon. MAPLE. BACON. If I could draw a Homer Simpson drooling face I would be doing it right here. A Canada Mallow if ever there was one.  I've never met The Marshmallow Lady but as far as I am concerned she is a confectionery angel.  I should put the same caveat on this as some other reviewers have in that I have never made it to the cafe but rest assured next time I'm in Edinburgh I'll be coming. She's also got an online sale live until the 15th January if you have ever considered taking a punt on this marshmallowy goodness now is the time! You won't regret it!",

    "text": "I didn't know that artisan marshmallows were even a thing, let alone something that could sustain an entire shop before The Marshmallow Lady.  I've bumped into this business at a few markets here and there over the past year but never thought too much of it, because i'm not a huge marshmallow fan (I know, i'm a monster). I didn't really understand why you might NEED an entire bag of marshmallows - do you just eat them like crisps at home? Or would I need to start harbouring a strong s'more addiction?   And then winter rolled around...  With hot chocolates and the occasional Baileys & coffee making a frequent appearance, artisan marshmallows suddenly made a lot more sense and The Marshmallow Lady's unique selection of flavours allow me to play the hot chocolate mad scientist on particular dreary days. I still can't eat them on their own - it's too much of a pure sugar hit for me - but an eggnog marshmallow in white hot chocolate? Pretty much crack. Christmas crack.  I delight in this so much, that today I bought over 50 marshmallows for an upcoming event to serve as a little extra something to plain old hot chocolate. What solidified my fandom of this store? Those 50 marshmallows cost me about 20 and the folks who helped me out were delightful.  I might not become a regular here, but for any and every occasion that MAY require marshmallows, it will forever be my go-to.",

    "text": "Listen up y'all, imma tell you about my homie the Marshmallow Lady. She will change your life and she will improve your Christmas, and here's how.  Do you know what Secret Santa is? Do you have to do it with family members that you hardly know? Did you scramble to think of anything you know about them and come up with, \"Well, they eat food, and I've seen them pick up a cup of tea every now and again...\"   Bazinga! Get them some dang fancy-ass hot cocoa. And then scoot yer butt on down to the Marshmallow Lady and goggle all her wares, everything from mulled wine flavor to classic vanilla to chocolate to PEANUT BUTTER. Some of them you can get in cute little perfect-gift-size packages at a steal for 2 for 6, because let's face it, where else can you get ballin', homemade, artisan marshmallows in Edinburgh?!  Now that I've changed your life let me tell you how I know that the Marshmallow Lady is on point: it was thanks to ONE of her marshmallows, one gifted to me in what should've been an obvious coupling with a packet of hot cocoa. This silly marshmallow novice thought instead that it was a Turkish Delight. When I bit into like the godless heathen that I am my mind and tastebuds blew into a million tiny delighted pieces. It was seriously so good that I left that same day to purchase more as gifts, ready to spread the love. So, you make of that what you will, folks!  If you do manage to make the trek to the Good Lady's abode, then you should definitely treat yourself to a snack or a cuppa while there. Despite the small size of the place that simultaneously functions as a cafe and marshmallow laboratory there are a few seats available for a quick respite, and what better way to test the marshmallowy waters? You certainly can't trust my word alone, so go forth, for science!  My only word of caution would be to vegans and vegetarians, as the marshmallows do contain gelatin as all good marshmallows do. It would be stellar if the Marshmallow Lady came up with a non-gelatinous version, but until then I'm not-so-secretly bending my own rules a wee bit because... THEY'RE DAMN GOOD!",

    "text": "Point the first: the shop is a working shop devoted to marshmallows and also stocking the finest in local artisan confectionery (Pinnies & Poppyseeds shortcake, Edward & Irwyn chocolate) - no longer any cafe element to it. Kitchen visible. Packaging stacked neatly on the shelves. Icing sugar tramped charmingly from till to window over the otherwise pristine shop floor. Point the second: it's vintage and cutesy without being kitsch or saccharine. The colours are very slightly brighter and more vibrant than the oh-so-trendy macaron/candyfloss shades you're seeing everywhere at the moment. Point the third: They have a framed picture of Mr StayPuft. Point the fourth: Sean, aka Mr Toontrait, the chirpy fun chappy who served me, seemed to be 100% in love with the shop and I could have stuck around chatting about marshmallows and his illustrations (he did the logo) for hours. Point the fifth: those marshmallows though. UNFFFFF. Uh. May. ZING.",

    "text": "I confess; I haven't visited the Marshmallow Lady. But I just had to write a review because I have tried her wonderful, dreamy sugar-puffs of heaven. All those other marshmallows you've had...Those aren't marshmallows! THESE are marshmallows. Believe me, you're going to want to buy packs for all your sweet-toothed friends just to see their faces when they taste these perfect light and fluffy squares and take a one-way ticket to sweet, sweet mallow heaven.   Thank you to Brown & Co delicatessen in Bridge of Allan for stocking such a delicious  product. Of course, I want to share the joy of these sweet heaven-sent bouncy mallow-pillows with everyone. But I also want to keep them all to myself. Such is the yum of the Marshmallow Lady's produce, and what a predicament to be in!  I want to try all the flavours and I want to visit the fine Lady herself.   Marshmallow Lady, I commend you. Keep working your mallow-magic and I'll forever be a fan!",

Rose marshmallow is too sweet for me but the raspberry and lemon ones are really good! Roasted marshmallow milkshake is good to try as well. Bought the Jack & Daniel's flavour (yep, they have this wonderful flavour here) as well, looking forwards to trying it :D",
