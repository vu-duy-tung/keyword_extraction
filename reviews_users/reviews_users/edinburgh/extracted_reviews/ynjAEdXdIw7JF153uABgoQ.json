    "text": "My girlfriend and I decided last minute to go out for something to eat tonight, she was in the mood for a takeaway pizza but I said let's try Croma on Lothian Road - we had walked past it a million times and always said we needed to try it.   We walked into a fairly quiet restaurant around 7pm on a rainy Sunday, my girlfriend had the Americana pizza and I settled for the Mushroom and Goat's Cheese penne with added chicken. My meal was delightful, fresh rocket and a generous amount of freshly grated Parmesan on top, only 1 for the extra chicken (and hey there was quite a lot of it!)  Due to the quality of the main meals we went for dessert, I had the Raspberry Cheesecake and my partner the Chocolate Fudge Cake, accompanied by some really creamy vanilla ice cream.   The Latvian waitress was a delight as well, she was friendly and able to comment with a few recommendations which is always appreciated.   Great job by all involved and would happily come back every night!",

You can book a table and pre-order if there is a big group of you and you are on your lunch hour.  They accommodate my veggie requests like using a different pizza cutter for my veggie pizza than the meat one.  Tasty pizzas and the staff are nice too",

    "text": "I hear good things about their pizza, but so far we've only visited Croma for breakfast. I'm no poached egg connoisseur, but what I sampled was outstandingly good, and far better than the other poached egg dishes I've been served on my travels around Edinburgh.  The place is located in the former foyer of the Odeon Cinema (the cinema remains, but with it's main reception now downstairs), so I'm not sure the decor will appeal to everyone, but I thought it was very smart, with a nice open kitchen.  One of those really unlikely places that offered a very pleasant surprise, I'd make a breakfast visit to Croma a priority.  So overall, we said: \"we were really impressed with Croma. The value on offer is excellent, with the omelette coming in at 3 and the poached egg dishes at 4. We'll be back to try their pizzas, at some point, but next time you're looking for a good egg breakfast in this part of town, we'd recommend that you visit Croma.\"",
