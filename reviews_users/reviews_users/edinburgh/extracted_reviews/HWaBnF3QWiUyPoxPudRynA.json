    "text": "Like every other reviewer on here it's hard to find a bad word to say about Cloisters. Located just off Tollcross along Melville Drive it takes it name from the church it is still attached to and benefits from some quirky architecture and an unusual layout as such. Decorated in dark wood with old fashioned mirrors, wooden pews, and a roaring fire Cloisters is welcoming and timeless.   The selection of ales is excellent - four regulars and five guests - and if you don't see something you recognise the bar staff will guide you with ease. Alternatively they're more than happy to take requests for guest beers. Perhaps more to the point the staff know how to pull a pint properly - the pumps aren't gas assisted, the ale is at the right temperature (ie. not so cold it numbs your taste buds), and you get a full pint without having to scowl.   If you're not after beer the selection of wines and spirits is good. 'The Jibe' sauvignon blanc is an award winning wine at a frankly bargainous price and well worth a shot. Whisky wise the selection has fallen over the last year or so but is still one of the biggest in Edinburgh with styles (and prices) to suit all tastes - staff recommendations can be variable but always forthcoming.   Foodwise the fare is simple, well-crafted, and befitting of the establishment. Don't order if you're in a rush but if you've got time to put the world to right over a couple of pints you'll be pleasantly surprised and not out of pocket. Be warned, the chef likes potato.   Combining great ale, friendly staff, good food, and a wonderful atmosphere Cloisters attracts a varied but civilised crowd of people. Students, professionals, and regulars are all friendly, things very rarely get out of hand and the fact the pub is busy to the point of bursting most Fridays and Saturdays is testament enough.   My local for nearly four years now and very very highly recommended.",

    "text": "The Cloisters is an ideal Friday night drinks location with a good, lively atmosphere and wide selection of beers, ales and even some unusual spirit choices which should please all tastes. The bar is located just off the Meadows which is just far enough away from the banks and offices on Lothian Road (which means it isn't as packed as some pubs in the area). It unfortunately doesn't have any music which I think makes it more of a weekday pub than a Saturday night venue. The food is also very good although my one criticism of Cloisters is that the service for food is unbelievably slow which means it's impossible to go there for lunch (waiting an hour for food isn't acceptable when you only have a lunch hour!). Having said that, when the food arrives it is good so it's recommended if you have time to spare.",

Cloisters is a fantastic bar with the best selection of cask conditioned ale offered by any bar in Edinburgh. If one gets bored with trying the selection of guest ales on offer there is always the old staple Best, possibly the finest liquid known to man, to fall back on. An eclectic clientele formed mainly of geeks, and old fashioned types that enjoy a jolly good ale coupled with some jolly good banter. Not a great place to go sarging unless you are currently studying for a PHD in chemistry but a jolly good place for a catch up with mates. 5 Stars!",

Their regular ales are superb: the standard Deuchars, then Timothy Taylor Landlord, Stewards Holy Grail and Trade winds. After that, they have (i think) 5 guest ales that change regularly.   The pub has no music, no TV screens, no idiots. It's great if you just want to go and talk to your friends.   It gets very busy at weekends, and it gets hard to find a seat, but there are plenty of standing areas with ledges to rest you pint.   There's an extensive library of single malts, with some spectacular inclusions.   Along with the ale they have a great selection of wine and bottles continental beers.   A great selection of board games to keep you busy if the conversation runs dry and the food is brilliant pub grub. In fact it's not pub grub, its restaurant standard food at very agreeable prices.   Highly recommend Cloisters. Highly",

The staff are friendly and enthusiastic about their beer, so if you're not sure what to try first, just ask! They'll happily pour you a sampler to help you decide.   This bar is about more than just the real ale though, there is also a fine selection of whisky, they stock the fantastic Thistly Cross Cider, and though some regulars may gasp (it is a bar known for its beer after all), I've even enjoyed a few very good wines here: they have a great selection.   I've only eaten here once, and to be honest they weren't the best nachos I've ever had... but that was a couple of years (and a kitchen and menu makeover) ago, so I'd happily eat here again.   They have books on the mantlepiece and a selection of board games to play, this bar is very popular though, so you may be hard pressed to find an empty table to set your board up on.   This is a great place to meet a few friends for some great beer, and some good chat, and just as great for a larger gathering.... I've been here for more than a few farewells!",

Most have been taken over by 'gastro- pubs' serving average food, showing sport 24/7 and offering a limited range of the run of the mill beers.  This place is a refreshing blast from the past. There is no music or TV playing, in the winter there is a roaring fire and you can get yourself a deck of cards or chess set to while the way a cold Edinburgh Sunday afternoon. While the feeling is of a more traditional pub it has more modern decor and doesn't feel claustrophobic or cramped as some traditional pubs can feel. The only down side is that seating is limited so on a Friday or Saturday night when it is busy you can find yourself without a seat.  The bar staff are very knowledgeable and happy to answer questions and give recommendations on beers, ales and whiskeys to someone who knows a lot less than them (i.e me!) without being patronising. If it isn't too busy they are also willing to let you have a try of a couple of drinks so you can pick your favourite. They also have a 'malt of the month' and serve a wide range of Scottish beers and ales.",

As far as pub food is concerned, this is good quality food.  I went for the very common fish & chips, the 'Trade Winds' batter was light and crispy and the chips on the side were nice and chunky, and the fish was nice.  I was asked if I wanted tartare sauce (which I did) and a huge jar turned up!   My friend had the pork cheeks served with pancetta cakes and mash.  I had a little taste and wished I had ordered that! As far as drinks are concerned, Cloisters have a great range of guest ales and whiskies, and is not overpriced.  It can be tricky to get a seat when the place is busy (which it is often) and you'd better be quick at the musical chairs game! One of my favourites traditional pubs in town, and certainly a good one to take visitors too.",

Whisky, I can do, as a kind of tasting exercise and for recognition of a quality malt, but as a regular beverage, not so much. I can just about handle a sip of different beers/ales/lagers/don't know the difference, but to drink a pint would take me a full evening, and that's not fun, because warm beer is not cool. Much more of a wine or Sailor Jerry girl.  Anyway, I know they offer a lot of special ales here and change their selection around every week, so this should definitely be a calling point for people who like to vary their beer varieties. The same goes for whisky, as they have a big selection behind the bar. It's always busy, no matter what night of the week I've tried coming here to obtain a seat, so don't bank on guaranteed seating unless you arrive early. It's got a real proper pub atmosphere to it though, which I like, and there's always a good mix of people noising the place up with banter.",

I was told a while ago that their food is quite good but every time I was there they were't serving.  They're known for erradic serving times that follow the whims of the staff.   When I went in for a pint last week I thought it was very fortunate that they'd just started serving food for the evening so my boyfriend an I decided to take advantage of the elusive opportunity.  He ordered fish & chips and I ordered a steak burger. To their credit, the fish was cooked very well.  It was moist on the inside and crispy on the outside.   The burger, however, was abysmal.   Not only was the meat tough and dry, but the bun was several days old.  I'm not exaggerating when I say several - it was difficult to cut in half, difficult to bite even.   Now, I am not one to complain about food being too salty or the wrong temperature or anything that comes down to personal taste or what may have been a completely honest mistake on the part of the chef.  However, someone cut that bun in half, knew JUST how horribly stale it was, and served it anyway.  booooooooo.",

    "text": "Instantly recognisable as an old man's haunt, Cloisters is an intimate bar with a decor that reaches out to the yesteryears.  After drinking the watery, flat, mass produced rubbish that you find in clubs around Edinburgh, Cloisters offers fine ale that's sourced from tangible places and not some steely lifeless factory. I admit, I'm a little biased, Cloisters sell my favourite ale: 'Landlord' on tap and frequently sell a host of other alternative ales (try the Black Sheep if it's available). Nonetheless if you fancy a quiet drink with a bunch of beer enthusiasts this is an exceptional place to start.",

    "text": "Back when I was a student, three of us would meet at Cloisters of a Wednesday evening and put the world to rights. For a measly five pounds, we'd have three pints of Aviator then toddle back home over the meadows. For a few years the bar was run by a tall, thin, bearded man who would ring the bell at the appropriate time and holler may we have, your last orders please! As regulars we always knew to expect this. It was highly amusing seeing the fright some of the first-timers got.   Unfortunately the price of the beer has gone up and the bearded man no longer works there, but the atmosphere hasn't changed one bit.   If you're lucky enough to find a seat, it's a great place to spend a few hours bumping gums over a real ale or a rare whisky. I ate dinner there fairly recently and whilst it wasn't haute cuisine, for 6 it was amazing value. Rather strangely, the barmaid told us there were no potato products left in the kitchen but when our meals arrived we had each had some boiled, mashed, chipped and dauphinoise on the plate.   The mix of customers keeps Cloisters lively and friendly - with students, professionals and old regulars all mingling amicably.   They always have a Malt of the Moment on offer, in addition to an amazingly extensive range of other single malts.   The main attraction for a lot of people is the ever changing selection of real ales. As it's coming up for Halloween, I suspect they might be getting some Witches' Brew in - a perfect winter warmed of a beer if ever there was one. Slightly dangerous at about 8% however.",

From the outside it looks like a bit of a local and if it wasn't for the good reviews on here I definitely wouldn't have entered as casually as I did.  Looking at the bar you know this lot are serious about their real beers and there is nothing that makes me happier than real beer. Apart from real coffee and wine gums, but not together.  There was 9 ale pumps, about the same in beer taps and 6-12 different bottled beers. Very homely old fashioned bar with wooden tables and chairs. Even a stool if you want to practice your \"lean\".  If you're serious about your beer, give this little guy a chance. Stay for a while, the bar does grow on you I promise.  I have nothing to say on their food as I'd already eaten but the Emily H seems to have summed it up pretty well.",

Call it the natural suspicious Glaswegian in me, but I was not expecting that much when I travelled through on Saturday, It turns out there is quite a few nice places that I would head back to and one that falls into that bracket is certainly Cloisters.   It sort of looks like an old church. It certainly had lots of stone work and wood, but it ain't an old mans style pub in my opinion. It's more like a converted old building that has  been turned into a modern bar. All good so far, a nice place for a pint in pleasant surroundings, but what steps this place up to a higher level for me is the beers on offer. They are yet another good bar doing craft beers and have a good selection available on their taps.   If craft beer is your thing then this place is worth a look, I can't comment on food but the booze went down very well.",

It's a classic old fashioned place, wooden benches and stools, and some good spots for groups to chill. A popular spot among the local students and local young professionals, beer enthusiasts also flock here regularly.  They have the occasional tap takeover, which is always a recipe for disaster. The good news is it is less than 10 minutes from my flat, so stumbling home is OK - and I can meander through the meadows!!  Never tried their food, but that's not important.",

The atmosphere always seems some what lacking and I always feel like I am in some bar up north where they know your not a local/regular. The bar area gets quite cramped and busy I really haven't enjoyed a night here standing at the bar in quite some time.   The decor changes now and again as does the lighting. The place was refurbished recently and after the lick of paint the lights also seemed to get turned up. One of things i enjoyed about the place before was the low key lighting,  open fire and dark wood features. Raising the lighting levels didn't work for me.   Okay enough moaning... what i do like is the staff they are always friendly and really know their drinks. The food is pretty nice to boot with tapa/meze style offerings. however  the reason people come here is for booze and mainly the ales. I am not an ale drinker but my friends are and love this place. For me they have some great organic lager and often some very interesting ciders. The booze selections are great with gin, borbon, whisky etc all covered by the top shelf spirits.   Decent enough boozer just doesn't ever feel comfortable to me. I don't mind going if someone suggests it but I wouldn't suggest going here myself.",

Since moving westwards I haven't been in until last weekend and I was pleasantly surprised to see the place hadn't changed!   The crowd is not your usual 'Edinburgh craft beer' crowd. More an older group who won't make way for you at the bar but that's part of the charm of this place for me.   The service is great and the staff are always good with banter.

This was (I think) our second stop of the day and brief though our visit was, I loved it and have every intention of being back soon.  Looks like a bland, slightly old mannish place from the outside but inside it's exactly what a pub should be. Friendly bar staff, excellent beer selection and a lovely wee table in the far right corner that catches the sun through the window in just the right way. I could while a lot of hours away here on a sunday with a book and some beers.   For a Saturday afternoon with rugby on at Murrayfield it wasn't too busy either. Plenty busy enough, just not rammed to the rafters busy, which was a pleasant surprise!  If you're a beer head, you could do a lot worse than head down here!",

You can also play one of the boardgames on offer.   On Fridays and weekends it gets busy and you'll wait a long time to get served.  It is in a good spot - close enough to the Meadows and slightly away from the other bars. So brilliant for a couple of drinks and a chat when just visiting, and if you are a local it gives you the chance to enjoy a quiet pint on the not so busy days.   I am not a big fan of this bar to be honest. It is difficult to explain, but for me the atmosphere is just a little missing that tiny bit to make it comfortable enough to spend a long time here. The occasional visit is all right though.   The beers are reasonably priced. They also offer a meze / bar snack menu which has interesting fares on offer.  I wouldn't go out my way to visit, but will not say no to anyone wanting to meet up here.",

They offer well kept craft draught ale, lager and cider alongside a good range of whisky and a fair range of rum and gin. What you won't get here is generic beer or lager (no Heineken or Belhaven beers here), rather they offer quality drinks from smaller brewers. If you aren't sure what to try the bar staff are knowledgeable and professional, giving you a taste of the ale or guiding you to the right drink.  It does get busy and you may not get a seat between the various groups of folk from all ages and walks of life, though if you do then settle in and chat or perhaps play one of the boardgames they keep behind the bar...  In short if you are after a good quality pint then Cloisters is near the top of the list in an area fairly well served with good pubs.",

Yes, that's sad, but well, you didn't live to see me drinking age and really, that's a crying shame because I'm pretty sure we would have liked the same bars. Like just tonight I sat at the bar with two men who owned a brewery and we talked about Scottish weather, baseball sports stars of old and we asked the people near the door if they could shut it because we were getting a little chilly.   This place looks like what it is. It's a big ole church that has a big ole (and massively awesome) selection of the good stuff. Yep, that's beer. I know \"Scotland be all about whisky, son\" but as a complete pussy, and a beer lover, I prefer to walk home rather than throw up in a taxi on the way.   And that's Cloister's. A place I would bring my grandpa had he made it until now (he'd be like 104 now, which would be even cooler) and we would have a beer with other old men and talk about the good ole days when people used to send faxes and watch television with commercials.   This isn't a dark and dingy old man pub, far from it, it's a very well lit middle aged man pub and I could come in here knowing I could get a couple of good beers and no 22 year old will be wasted on tequila sunrises looking all skeevy and try to pick me up.   It's a talking pub, a pub where you meet up with an ex and let him admit that he did some terrible shit, but you'd be too embarrassed to cry but deep down you're happy he's finally saying it all. Then you go home and let it out. (That never happened, I'm just imagining - I'm just saying it's the type of place you can have a deep and meaningful conversation over beers).  This started out as a letter to my grandpa, and it ended up not being, mostly cause, well... I don't even know if he liked beer. I know he liked kielbasa, fried dough and smoking cigarettes. So, if anyone knows a good place for that.",

It was pretty quiet apart from the low mutterings of people having conversations and I like that sort of thing when I dont fancy going to so hip bar with blasting music and cocktails.  The drinks were pretty much as I expected - with names like 'Badgers Arse' and 'Biships Bottom', and while I didnt enjoy any of them personally - my mate said they were some of the best he'd ever tasted - and after a conversation with the friendly bar man, it was discovered that most of the ales were local. Which I guess is pretty cool.

I frequently come in here with friends for drinks and I always have a great time.   The decor inside is modern and pleasant, not tacky, and you are always greeted by friendly and warm staff. Cloisters sell about ten different real ales, always a bonus for the guys, as well as serving some beautifully tasting wines for the ladies.   Cloisters Bar is always worth a look in for lunch, which they serve seven days a week, and it very reasonably priced. Their menu includes the traditional pub food such as baked potatoes, sandwiches and fish and chips. Their burgers deserve special mention as they are delightful - huge and really juicy and served with proper chips.   The atmosphere is always lively inside, but it can get very busy on a Friday night so probably best to get there early to ensure you get a seat.",

One of them had already poured me my second beer, when we started talking about West Coast IPAs, and he told me that the manager of the bar brews his own beer, which he thought I might like better than what he had just poured me. He poured out the just-poured beer and produced a bottle of Conviction IPA by Elixir Brew Company, and it was indeed good stuff.  As to other details, the bar seemed to be frequented by locals, and was a somewhat older crowd, at least the time I visited. It was quiet enough to have a good conversation. We ended up talking to a couple of guys at the next table. Just the sort of place a pub should be.",

    "text": "Another great Edinburgh pub. After work drinks a speciality.  Good seating, good choice of real ale. Thoroughly enjoyable all round.  Can get rather busy but I never think that's a bad thing for a pub! Just means you have to be super good at finding chairs. I come here for drinks with a few friends, or to sit and read on my own there is even a book exchange on the mantle.   They let dogs in which is a definite plus.   Beer choice is spot on although sometimes a little \"samey\" but that might just be me! I at one point had an issue with grumpy staff but that was a year ago or so and I've had nothing but smiles the last few times I've been in!   Recommended. An Edinburgh classic.",
