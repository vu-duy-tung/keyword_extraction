The aromatic duck was slightly overlooked but tasted great.  The pork was cooked perfectly and the dry fried green beans were outstanding. Great garlic mix and a nice spice to them.  Everything had a terrific flavour that was enjoyable.  I would return to this location again.",

    "text": "DO NOT EAT HERE!!!  The food is horrible and tasteless. I had vegitarian spring rolls that were clearly taken out of a freezer bag thrown in a fryer and burned.   I then had the chicken with cashews. There was absolutely no flavor, seasoning or substance to this dish. It was so bland.   I followed with a \"fresh and light raspberry cheesecake perfect for after a meal.\" It came out frozen with freezer burn on it. When I smacked it with my spoon the lady yells to me \"you have to wait a little bit.\" It was solid as a rock. Just horrible.   All this experience of bad food cost me 25. I recommend trying some place else. There IS good food in Edinburgh, you just have to find it!",

    "text": "Two words: Not impressed! I thought I stop by and get my take away dinner on a spontaneous note.  The place appeared empty at arrival. Sometimes people are going in and out, so I thought I give it a try. As usual, I ordered my HOT and SOUR soup and some Beef Chow Mein.  There are more choices on the menu of course, but this is what makes me happy, or so I thought :-)  The prices are high, the soup contained too much pepper, the Chow Mein was bland, not really that friendly a welcome (well, happy to see me of course to buy something - No wonder, I felt so used!)   the place decor very boring (whilst I waited I had a good look around)..... Well, do I need to say more?",

    "text": "I have always had a nice meal here. I am not a fan of their chicken satay, too much pineapple for my liking but I enjoy the Singapore Fried Rice, Roast Duck in spicy chilli sauce, Chicken Curry,  Lar Chee Lamb and  the Pork Char Siu with Szechuan Sauce. Their dumplings rival Chop Chop. I especially like the way they cook the fried rice very light and fluffy and not greasy like some places. The staff are friendly and courteous and will have a joke with you if you are a relaxed diner. The manager knows her regulars well and chats and jokes with them.",
