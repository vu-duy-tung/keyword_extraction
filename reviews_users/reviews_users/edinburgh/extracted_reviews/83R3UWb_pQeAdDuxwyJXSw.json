    "text": "I wanted to like this place but in every way except one, it was a disappointment.  We ordered the savory crepes and they were strangely soggy with a few pieces of ingredients slopped on the middle. They were supposed to have sweet chili sauce but only one actually did.  They only took part of our order so one member of our party had to wait much longer for her crepe. Hers was undercooked and had even fewer ingredients than the first two.   The waitstaff was attentive and charming and were very apologetic when the mistake was noticed, so one star is for them.",

    "text": "I've had two visits to Coro now, which has accidentally created something that may well be the closest thing to a perfect human experience: The Trio of Activities. First step: seat yourself in the Blue Bear; have brunch. Step two: meander through the Botanics until eyes glaze over from plant saturation. Step three: have CHOCOLATE!  Coro is situated right up the road from the Inverleith entrance of the Edinburgh Royal Botanic Garden. It's a moderately spacious little joint that advertises a surprisingly expansive menu, anything from toasties, breakfast, drinks, and, obviously, LOTS of chocolate. Chocolate cakes. Hot chocolates. Chocolate milkshakes. You name it.  Both visits in I've been treated to some truly decadent, sometimes even overwhelmingly so, experiences. The first was with espresso-chocolate-milkshake madness, each made with actual in-store chocolate crumbled or melted into the shake. No sir, no powdered stuff here! The second was with my visiting parents. I had a dark chocolate hot chocolate with a peanut butter spoon (omg). My parents had something called a hot-and-cold hot chocolate, which features a scoop of WHITE CHOCOLATE ice cream floating on top. No vanilla here, folks. Let that simmer a moment.  Guhhhhhhhh. Be still my sluggishly beating, cardiac-arrest-having heart.  Seriously. If you like chocolate, do yourself a favor and check this place out. You won't regret it. Not only are the offerings deliciously decadent, but the environment is cute, with sayings like \"Chocolate always understands\" etc. written on the walls, as well as an excellent offering of hand-made chocolate bars available for purchase in store. It's the perfect spot for a quick rest after a wander through the Botanics, especially if you want to couple that with a borderline sinful chocolate experience. Go forth my chocolate minions, and stuff thy gobs!!",

    "text": "A friend and I were walking down the street, heading to The Orchard for an early dinner when the aroma from this place stopped us in our tracks and we had to take a look at the menu. We decided to return after dinner to see what they had to offer.   Cosy little spot for a dessert. The menu is massive and it was difficult to choose what I wanted, but settled on a shot of hot chocolate with chili and the cocoa bavarois slice. The hot chocolate wasn't quite what I was expecting, but it was delicious all the same. Melted dark chocolate in a shot glass, topped with spicy dried chili. The bavarois slice left something to be desired as it was easy to tell it had been sitting in the refrigerated case for some time and tasted quite stale. I'm sure a fresh slice would have been wonderful, but this was not very good. I'd love to return and try one of their crepes or waffles.",

    "text": "This place is heaven for those with a sweet tooth! Coro offers crepes, pancakes, waffles and fondue. The menu was extensive and you can make your own anything and add several different toppings. The staff were distant and very slow at taking orders, seating customers and service in general. The cafe was relatively small and although the vibe wasn't extremely welcoming the cafe was very cute. They had writing on the walls with sayings such as 'Chocolate always understands' setting your mind at ease before your death by chocolate!",
