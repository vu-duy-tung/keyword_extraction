Pavilion Cafe is a former bowling green that's been renovated beautifully, and crowned with a wonderfully delightful menu :-)  My friend and I shared the full Scottish breakfast - a tasty plate load of well-presented local produce.  The only disappointing thing about this wonderful meal was the black pudding, which simply wasn't my cup of tea.  The pudding not withstanding, our breakfast was delicious!  I look forward to returning soon  :-)",

    "text": "Those good vibes Steph D spoke about in her review? I swear I felt them from all the way outside.  I perched on the sofa, looking out at the meadows, mint tea in hand and thought, I could do this a little more often.   I love that this cafe exists where you just wouldn't expect to stumble across it; it makes the find all the more a treat. A good book and sunshine would definitely enhance the experience, and I'm looking forward to getting to know Pavilion over the coming summer months.",

    "text": "First off this place is honking! Outside it reeks of urine and puke, they do not even make an effort to clean the dog pee. They have literary no sense of hygiene, there is mould climbing all up the walls of the cafe area and in the kitchen, they also do not use gloves when handling food (which is also ridiculously priced).  Second, they are EXTREMELY rude to customers having been skipped in queue numerous times (not only me but my sister also), they are also not very welcoming and stare at you up and down if your not a raging hippie like them. Lastly it is run be the biggest cow you will ever encounter, who has bullied my mother multiple times!  Overall it is a smelly, judgemental, rude place and will will stay at least 7 miles away from it (but I'll probably still be able to smell it from there)!  P.S The toilet doesn't have a lock!",

    "text": "The Pavilion Cafe is the only cafe located squarely in the Meadows. Their seating is mostly outside, where a variety of colourfully clashing chairs and tables are ordered randomly in front of the cafe, giving it a homely quirky look. If it's warm out, rest assured that there is no better place to grab a bite when you're out on a sunny day.  They serve mezze plates that come with a variety of freshly prepared salads, dips and warm pita bread alongside a selection of carefully prepared wraps and paninis, all made from local, organic produce. The staff are always friendly, and alongside their lunch meals, all under a fiver, they have homemade cakes procured from a variety of local bakers, freshly ground Zapatista coffee, an assortment of teas and organic fizzy drinks. If you're out with family, the cafe provides a mishmash of children's toys to play with, so you can lounge and enjoy your food and drink (or join them).   Because of its location, the cafe is mostly open from spring, through the summer and into mid-autumn and its opening hours are often subject to the whims of the weather. During summer nights, they've been known to show films on makeshift screens, sometimes to the accompaniment of live music.   In other words, the Pavilion is more than just a place to get a bite, but a place to spend the day, the night, or sometimes even the whole summer.",

    "text": "The Pavilion Cafe occupies an ideal location within the Meadows area and a lot of people make use of what it has to offer: Sandwiches, Wraps, Chips, Crisps, Soup, Salad, Tea, Coffee, Water.  The entrance is inviting you to come in. You enter a small room with a few tables and chairs neatly decorated with colourful pillows and in general will notice a continental flair to the interior. The kitchen and sandwich area is attached to the dining area and you can watch the staff preparing the food.  I ordered a Moroccan Hummus Sandwich and an Orange juice and paid about 5, which I believe is far too expensive compared to what you get.  This cafe is perfect for Vegetarians (I think) as you get different variations of vegetarian options. For my taste the Moroccan sandwich was a bit too plain, absolutely no kick to it :-( and I thought I had wasted my money.  Overall, the place has the  perfect location and if you need something ad hoc when lingering  in the Meadows, then go and get it.",

    "text": "This place is special. I have no idea why except to say it has a really \"good vibe\" but here, I'll set the scene for you:  I am pretty sure that one day I will be old. And as an old lady I hope to have a very deep voice, long, crazy hair and wear flowy skirts and ethnic jewelry and I'll be very zen. I might even be one of those ladies that burns incense and sage all over my house and tells people that they have an old soul.   But before that I will be a hippie mother. I will worry about the quality of the food I am giving to my children. They will eat seeds and organic fruit for snacks and drink soy and never say politically incorrect things (like their mother hahahah). They will play noncompetitive sports, wear hemp and I will have had a water birth with a midwife in my home - with sage burning again for a good vibe.   This may or may not be True for my future.  Still, when I go to Pavilion Cafe I see my future unfolding like this as I sip on a soy milk latte eating an amazing bowl of veggie minestrone soup with maybe the best bread I've had in a LONG time.  It's just so. so... chill.   The hodge podge of chairs and books and stools outside give me the feeling that if I owned a farm in Western Massachusetts (the posh part) this is how my children would grow up. My children would rifle through all my old records and pull out old gems (they have old records for sale here) and I would know that I had raised my little hippie kids right.   I love it here.",

    "text": "I'm a firm believer in the theory that watching other people doing sport is pretty much the same as doing it yourself, or at least on weekends when it's sunny. On such occasions the Meadows is a place for ipod docks, beers and frisbees, with the odd trip to the cafe slotted in here and there throughout the day for cake or ice cream. Not football or jogging.  Understandably, it's only open during the summer. But it's a great place to meet friends for a catch-up as it makes a refreshing change from all the wannabe upmarket cafes and delis that line the Meadows and charge 3 for a bang-average cup of coffee. It's also a great place to perv on the guys playing five-a-side.",

It has a really laid back vibe and fits in with the park great. This place has the following;  -Relaxed atmosphere -Great selection of light bites all very healthy and whenever I've been I usually go for a crisp, fresh salad. -Reasonable prices -Great outdoor seating to enjoy to summer sun.   ...and no pressure to hurry up and leave.  The only downside is that it's so popular, especially on sunny days so you might have to queue for a while.",

    "text": "Good food, good people, good music says the sandwich board outside this cafe. They are right on all three counts and should add a fourth- good location. The main selling point for me is that it is slap bang in the middle of the meadows and while sipping on your coffee and tucking into a cake you can watch the world go by.   I often come here on Saturday or Sunday mornings, if the weather is warm enough it's good to sit outside and blow the hangover cobwebs away. Watching all the sport that goes on in the meadows at the weekend you can almost convince yourself it looks fun... 'maybe I'll go for a run this week' you'll tell yourself only to find yourself in the same place next time with a muffin and a coffee and no nearer to kicking a ball or a going for a run. It's good to dream though!",

    "text": "On a sunny day on the meadows, after you have had a skinfull of alcohol and decided it would be unwise to start a bbq, head here to the Pavilion Cafe instead.  The food is pretty good (better than undercooked sausages at least), it's kind of medditerranian come basic cafe food which is enjoyable and pretty good value for around 5.  I think to be honest, anywhere that serves food on the Meadows is bound to be a hit with those who take advantage of the sun, but the Pavilion has hugely erratic opening times which can get a bit annoying if its closed just when you need food. Also, if its a really great day, be prepared to wait as the other millions of hungry students/sun worshipers queue in front of you.  Not a bad place for a bite to eat if you dont want to venture away from the meadows.",
