    "text": "My fiance and I got take out here twice while we were in Edinburgh. Both times I got the marinara, which was super tasty and simple, and plenty for one person. My fiance had the frizzante, which he liked, but thought it was a little too topping-heavy, and the lamb tagine, which he also liked. We also tried the Nutella dessert and it was delicious, but a little hard to eat. The prices were reasonable too. Another thing I loved was that they have a bunch of bottles of flavor infused olive oils to add to your pizza.",

    "text": "Great neighborhood pizza place. It's very small, only one table inside, a little counter and a few tables outside.  Nice interior and fast service. The dough is thin and delicious. I would have liked a little more of the toppings!!  They don't serve any  alcohol but they let you bring your own. We brought a bottle of wine  and had  FUN! They deliver as well. If you find yourself in Edinburgh, stop by or order in, you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "For two hungry girls visiting, this was perfect. We had passed by some days ago, and by the looks of the place we thought we might buy a pizza for dinner here some day. This specific day we had spent a long day sightseeing, and by arriving at our hotel a few squares from Dough we were basically dead - and ended up sleeping. By the time we woke up, the hotel restaurant had already stopped serving dinner, and we really weren't up for looking around for somewhere to eat. The local McD was an option until my friend remembered that cozy pizza place we had passed the other day, so we grabbed our wallets and walked out the door.   When we arrived they welcomed us warmly, and we quickly found something delicious from the menu (plenty of options!!), and even quicker they managed to give us our pizza. They made it all with us waiting there, and we were able to see the entire process. With the student discount we really could not complain, getting a 15 inch pizza for 10.   We grabbed the box and hurried back to our hotel, and boy did our mouths water by the smell of the fresh pizza! The size was perfect for 2 hungry girls, and it was even delivered with a small container of garlic olive oil. The crust was perfectly thin, the ingredients and topping fresh and it was perfectly cooked.  All in all: We would CLEARLY go back here - maybe even go to Edinburgh for this pizza alone, because it was soooo worth it!",

    "text": "It's a TINY little place in Rose Street and the downside is there's really no seating. A small bistro table inside and 2 picnic tables outside (that's not helpful in cold or rainy weather). But really, that's the only downside. The wood fired pizzas are REALLY good. Maybe the best I've found in Edinburgh. They're made to order with a wide variety of fun toppings or create your own. I was surprised how fast your pie is made and ready. Really fast! And they run a lunch special with a 10\" pie for half the price of the regular 18\" pie. I had a pizza and bottled water for 5. And it was a great pizza!!",

    "text": "Dough is located so close to my office that it's a daily struggle not to give in and get pizza for lunch every day. But equally, one slice, however generous that slice is, could not suffice. And so it is that more often than not I order the chef's special. Which is the only sandwich that Dough sells.  It's a Tuscan sausage, fried onions and foccacia sandwich that is pretty delicious. You do have to ask for sauce, and I'd recommend doing so as despite it being very tasty it is a little lacking without it.  The main offering is of course the pizzas, which are lovely. The slices are reasonably priced and are a quarter of an entire pizza, but I'm greedy and they don't satiate my appetite. And I can't bring myself to order an entire pizza for lunch. Actually I'm pretty sure there is a lunchtime 10\" version so next time I'm unable to resist I might have to go for that...  Mmmm pizza....",

I was able to add some of the delicious spicy salami and literally didn't even miss the cheese.   The kids had the Hawaiian and the meat pizza - both were fantastic.   Service was really friendly and accommodating. The staff looked like they really enjoyed each other's company which makes a huge difference in the service provided.   So good that we came back the next day!",

    "text": "Through in Edinburgh for the day with one of my besties who would eat pizza every day if he could get away with it, I naturally searched Yelp for the tastiest pizza options, and it seemed you guys really love Dough!  I can definitely see why. This totey wee pizza joint, located on Rose St (my new favourite street in Edinburgh, for some reason I'd never ventured down here before!) is firmly in the \"small-yet-mighty\" category as they serve up some darned tasty pizza! We managed to grab a table and I felt that there was a really nice atmosphere in the place. The member of staff serving us was really friendly and the tunes were rather good as well.  I opted for the slice deal (slice and a can of San Pellegrino, 3 if you get margherita or 4 for a slice with toppings) which does mean you only get to choose from certain pizzas, but I was very happy with my mushroom, parmesan and truffle oil pizza which went excellently with a cold can of limonata. My pal got a quattro formaggio pizza and while at first he was horrified because he thought there were mushrooms on it (boo to all you mushroom haters) it turned out to be one of the cheeses, so he happily scoffed most of it and took the last couple of slices away in a box.  For me, the base of a pizza is the most important component and Dough definitely have theirs bang on. It's delicious and just the right amount of crispy, plus you can never go wrong with a wood-fired pizza. I'd definitely be interested in coming back both for other types of pizza and their other, non-pizza options!",

They focus more on gourmet pizzas with fancier ingredients rather than your run of the mill pepperoni and cheese. Their website is well laid out and has a picture of every pizza that they have on offer. You can also create your own.",

    "text": "I was so excited to see Dough set up shop on Rose Street with its wood-fired oven. They do really fantastic, traditional Italian pizza with a whole wide range of amazing toppings. As Stacey said, they are indeed a serious rival for the best pizza in Edinburgh and I think that Dough maybe just stole the show for me! Between the friendly staff, cosy seating, outstanding pizza, and super reasonable prices (AND student discount) I think they have won me over. For less than 10 with the student discount we could get a huge delicious pizza with ham and mushrooms, and we could have gotten a 3 starter too and not broken the bank by any means.  We stopped in after Yelp's Superhero Yoga event last night and they had a steady footfall of people through the door for a Sunday evening, and it's fantastic they do take-away and delivery too. There are only a few (3) tiny tables inside and just a couple (2) outside so good luck getting a table but it's fantastic if you do!",
