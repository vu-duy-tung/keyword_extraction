    "text": "How to find an adequate superlative for the Kitchin... the amount of awards Tom Kitchin has won over the past year does it all to be honest - youngest Scottish chef to ever win a Michelin star, Scottish chef of the year, restaurant of the year... all after being open for a mere few months. The word exceptional springs to mind.   Their tag-line is \"From Nature to Plate\", and my, in what fashion does it get there!   for instance, if you were to go for a starter, there's \"seared hand dived Orkney scallops, served with endive tarte tatin and sweet Chateau de levant syrup\". Everything seems to be locally produced, from wild mallard from the Glenalmond Estate, to Roast apples \"from Moira's garden\". So its ethical too. If none of the hundreds of top critics who've ever reviewed the place can find a negative, how on earth do you expect me to?!   As far as i'm concerned, there's no better place to eat in Scotland, the UK or perhaps even the whole world. And they're so frustratingly young, Tom and Michaela, and have so much energy, it just seems unreal.   While the pricing might be a little above some restaurants, and you might have to book well in advance, take it from me - you won't be disappointed.",

A friendly greeting upon arrival always bodes well, and we were incredibly impressed with the staff throughout the night. Efficient, professional and friendly.   The food was out of this world. An arrangement of fresh bread was delivered for a wee snack whilst we pondered the menu, shortly followed by a gorgeous warm beetroot and creme fraiche soup. Every course after that was divine, and the wine was matched perfectly.   I'd recommend it for a special occasion (it is very pricey but soooo worth it for a treat) and we're saving our pennies already to head back for another anniversary.",

Seemed like people felt uncomfortable, no buzz about the place, too many staff standing about (dread to think how they can stay in profit as almost as many staff as customers!). My friend left their lamb and at over 21 for plate of veg, total rip off. You expect to have small portions in a fine dining restaurant but for the food to be really tasty and exceptional - at the Kitchin it most definitely did not fit into this category - would not recommend. The Witchery, Rhubarb at the Prestonfield or even Roti for fine dining, not the Kitchin and I can't understand why it has won so many awards.",

But when purely considering the food on offer, it can't score anything higher than two stars, as I've experience better; MUCH better. My starter and main courses were decidely ordinary; nowhere near Michelin star quality. Extremely disappointing.  Overall, we said: \"The Kitchin is a super-stylish place, with excellent attentive service, serving neatly presented dishes. They don't taste very good, though, making the overall experience completely forgettable. It left me entirely cold.\"",

The hostess is prompt and complete with replies, letting me know which nights are fully booked and advising me about better days to come in. I came here for lunch since all the dinners were booked up and had the prix fixe 3-course lunch. Really a steal in my opinion.The waiting staff worked as a great team so we didn't feel ignored even when our server was helping someone else as there were many other friendly staff checking on each other's clientele.   I loved having sweet potato chips at the table to crunch on when we entered and the selection of bread from a wheeled up bread cart with selections such as freshly baked sourdough and olive bread.  My starter was the octopus carpaccio which was fabulously laid out and accompanied with colourful pickled vegetables.   The main was the ox cheek which was so delicate that no knife was necessary.   Dessert was a chocolate pistachio souffle which was very creative and interesting. Not too heavy but nice and warm with a great flavour.  The hosts took care of calling our taxi as we exited to proceed with our day after, with hunger satisfied and tastebuds delighted.",

    "text": "Wow, Kitchin blew me away. The dining room was elegant but still bright. Service was very friendly except for the French staff who were sterile and highly efficient yet still professional as can only expected from a French server. The most refreshing part of Kitchin was actually seeing Tom Kitchin in the kitchen with his hands in the food; there is a small window that allows you to see into the kitchen from the dining room. It is becoming increasingly rare to see a chef in the restaurant that his name on it.   Veg crisp were giving as snack. A great selection of bread was also served. The amuse bouche of pumpkin soup with crunch pumpkin seed in it was very wintery and was more than just one small bite.  I was a bit weary of the Pig's Head and Langoustine because I was not sure how the Langoustine could add to this dish. Trust me something would be missing it wasn't on the plate. The pig's head was boned and rolled and had a great earthy spice to it.   My main of venison was cooked perfectly and had seven components on the dish. Any time I see many components on the dish I get nervous. But Kitchin surprised me again. This was a pretty hardy winter dish for a restaurant in this category. (I left really full)   My desert was simply titled Chocolate and features mall souflee, ice cream and blood orange marmalade the made everything else taste so much better.   When I told the staff I was from Boston I was invited into the Kitchen to meet Chef Kitchin and he also signed a copy of his cookbook for me. This guy seems really down to earth. My 5/5 review is based off the food I ate and not that I met the chef.",

    "text": "I realise that giving The Kitchin three stars is sacreligious.  I'll probably get kicked off Yelp or at least people will have no faith in my reviews from this point onward.  But, hear me out...  I've only been here once, 3.5 years ago, when my parents came over for my MSc graduation.  I'd been hearing rave reviews of Kitchin and thought it would be the perfect place for the double birthday + graduation celebration.  When I left California, my boss gave me the nicest bottle of wine I will probably ever be fortunate enough to consume.  I thought that my graduation celebration would be a very appropriate time to drink this wine.  I made my reservations at Kitchin and asked about bringing the wine.  They said \"we have a very extensive wine list, you will not need to bring your own.\"  I explained the situation and they explained a bit more firmly that I was not welcome to bring this bottle of wine.    I know that corkage/bringing your own wine to restaurants here is not a common as it is where I'm from, but I was shocked that they wouldn't allow for one bottle to be brought for a special occasion.  I accepted the situation and we went along sans wine.  To be honest, I don't remember much of the actual food.  By that I mean that my socks weren't blown off.  I was expecting so much and certainly had a lovely meal, but it all seemed a bit up itself and for no real reason which I could see.  The main thing I really remember from the dining experience is that our water and wine were kept at a different table so we weren't able to pour and drink to our own pace, we were at the mercy of those serving us.    I think I was a) too put off by the wine issue to fully enjoy it and b) am too used to fantastic food served in a more relaxed environment.  I have had amazing food with less cost and less fuss at other restaurants, and in the future I'll be sticking to these places, thanks.",

It's not an overly fussy place considering the Michelin star but focuses very much on the quality of ingredients, with the dishes being far more simplistic than say 21212. This is to its credit, however, and Mr Kitchin thoroughly deserves his recent title of best restaurant in Scotland.  If it's on the menu, the turbot with sea snails was stunning and one of the most memorable dishes I've eaten.   If you don't fancy forking out for the a la carte or tasting menu, the set lunch is excellently priced and provides close to the kitchin experience whilst putting a smaller dent in ones purse!",

Simple and delicious cocktails for anyone smart and savvy enough to venture away from vodka based juice to libations of Calvados, Mezcal and of course, whisky. While primarily Scottish staffed, the service wasn't much to be spoken of yet the food was worth it's hype. Farm to table consciousness of purely Scottish product was impressive, especially when the mini map scrolls were brought over and served as reference to the origin of primary ingredients. Nose to tail lamb and signature beef were difficult to turn down and the sommelier provided the perfect red compliment to my flavorful entree.

It had snails bacon and a quail egg on top, it was fantastic.  For my main course I had mutton, the dish came with a small side of braised shoulder meat, it was fantastic, and I wish I was eating right now.

The table are organised so that most people can peep in during their meal, and appreciate the effort put into their food. It's really cool to see Tom Kitchen put the final touches to your plate :)) It just makes the whole thing more exciting!  The food itself is wonderful. Really incredibly fresh and tasty. Seasonal and imaginative. We went for lunch and the 30-ish pound menu is cheap compared to the quality of the food. Quite a treat if you take some wine, but nonetheless worthwhile and to be remembered. I started with a pistachio, rabbit & foie gras terrine with an onion tatin. Just AMAZING! Then I had pork cheeks cooked like a \"blanquette\" with a white sauce, mushrooms, carrots, new potatoes. Delicious. The meat was so tender. Then I had the rhubarb-themed dessert: rhubarb fresh soup with poached pieces of rhubarb, rhubarb sorbet, caramel croquante, pannacotta. I really really liked it. So yummy. And we had the traditional petit-fours after that. Yum!  The restaurant is a little remote and far from the city centre, but it's ok. It's just in front of the Scottish government building.

Tom Kitchin isn't afraid to be adventurous in his mixes of flavours, which often delivers a whole new taste treat, but (on the rare occasion) strikes an odd discordant note on the palate. Local produce always fresh, especially fish.",

It was just before they got their star and haven't had a chance to go back recently but definitely will.   The decor is great - quite simple but seems expensive. The staff were exceptional - I don't think I have eaten anywhere with such knowledgeable staff. The wine waiter was great - friendly and not at all patronising. Our waitress was Canadian and made us feel very welcome - she kept my Dad and Uncle supplied with loads of the lovely home made bread throughout the meal.   Food was everything you would expect.   The only complaint was from my husband - he didn't feel full up after the meal. Should have eaten as much bread as my Dad!   Tom came out at the end of the meal and had a chat - very shy and charming - no pretense about him at all. He seems to love food and also love the restaurant.   At the time we didn't think the cost was too bad - think we paid about 50 a head.",

They then asked us for ID having already served us cocktails. - we asked for 1 lamb dish to be cooked medium/rare but they cooked all of our dishes medium/rare. We ordered the same mains so any difference would have been evident had there been any. I don't think my experience lived up to expectation.",

    "text": "The Kitchin has been on my to do list for a long time. 2 reasons for this : first it is difficult to get a table on popular days and secondly the prices. To circumvent point one you just visit in person And ask if anything is available. Their website states it is fully booked most if the time, but people will cancel! the secondary point is more a case of can you afford it.   We had a table on a Friday evening 18:30. We were advised the table was booked again at 20:45. That should've been enough time allotted for a good meal.  We opted for the 7 course tasting meal. I did advised the restaurant in advance about the allergies i have. They fully accommodated me! we added a Lobster course.   The food was amazing, no complaints. The service was good, too good.. it seems there was no set table allocation  structure, thus we got several times different waiters asking us the same questions. At least no waiting around for service! One thing is about the wine, a decent bottle is 60! no real cheaper options, as wine by the glass is around 11 each..  We noticed it was about 21:15 when we should get our coffees, we were asked if we wanted to take these in the bar. No problem.   In all a very pleasant evening, but I'd suggest a lunch time appointment, as it will be cheaper and you get a taste of the atmosphere. we'll be back in August for that.",

At well over 100 pounds per person with wine, it should be consistent and excellent and it just didnt make it",

We had the set 3-course lunch (a bargain at 28 - this is a Michelin star restaurant for goodness sake!).  You start with some crudites while perusing the menu.  There are only 3 choices but even so, it's difficult to pick.  Before your starter comes out, there's an amuse bouche to get you in the mood and some of the nicest sourdough bread I've ever tasted.  They're very proud of their Scottish food and they gave us a little map of Scotland rolled up and tied with a ribbon which highlights where in the country they source their ingredients.  We went for the matched wine package with our lunch and it's brilliant - you get a different glass of wine with each course and each wine is matched to your food.  And it really works - even the dessert wine, which I'm not usually a fan of, was lovely with the right dessert.  The food is brilliant - it's stylish but not fussy; beef, lamb, seafood - all cooked perfectly by somebody who is obviously passionate about good Scottish food.  The reason I love the place so much though is that it's so relaxed and easy going - doesn't feel like a \"posh\" restaurant despite the impeccable service and faultless food.  It's like they're so good, they don't need to be pretentious about it.  The matched wine package will add another 25 to your lunch.  We ended up around 57 each  - that's crudites, bread, an amuse bouche, three fantastic courses of lunch, three matched glasses of wine (or two cocktails for the one who doesn't drink wine), then coffee and petit fours to finish.  Not an everyday lunch, but definitely worth treating yourself now and again.",

Chef Tom lives and breathes his \"From nature to plate\" motto. Using the finest ingredients in a setting that allows them to show off their natural flavours. If you want to read more into this check out website where he explains in his own words.   There was one dish that I particularly enjoyed and that was the cod cheeks wrapped in pancetta. I'm gutted I never got a picture of that dish because it was presented perfectly on a pumpkin puree. But I will never forget the taste and the texture until the day that I die. The fish was soft, moist and delicate but the pancetta was a little more harsh and bold. It was the perfect combination.   The service was perfect. It was efficient but never rushed.   I don't drink wine so I can't comment on the wine list but we did have the signature beer. Named after Tom's Grandpa which was a nice accompaniment to the meal. The cocktails were impressive but i'm not sure they merit their price tag. They're good but nothing spectacular.",

We always go to Michelin restaurants for our trips and this one is a standout.  The other restaurants we went to was 21212 and Number One.  Number One was a let down.  But The Kitchin hit every spot.  We opt for the 3 courses menu and shared everything between us - the pig's head was a highlight - but the souffle was really really yummy.   The food is a good break from a 10 day marathon of Michelin star restaurants as it is not the typical Michelin tasting menu. I recommend!",

I called to confirm our reservation only to find out that I had wrote the wrong time down, luckily they found us an earlier time.  The exterior and interior of the Kitchin was amazing, very modern and nice. The staff as expected was pleasant and professional and quickly sat us. At these places I usually let the staff pick our food or if they have a seasonal selection I usually go the route.  Well they did, Chef Seasonal Selection which mainly comprised of seafood and one meat dish.   Next was picking wine and their sommelier was very helpful since picking French wine is definitely not my forte. He was very knowledgeable and even came an offered me a selection of red during my meat course, since we picked a bottle of white for the table.   The food came out and everything was amazing.  Again mainly seafood and the presentation was top notch.  The wine pairing made this whole event one of the best.  After dinner was complete, they offered us to have a seat in their lounge for after-dinner drinks or tea/coffee.  We of course wanted to take the whole experience in and since we were cabbing it, I picked a rare scotch.  To end a perfect meal, Tom Kitchin came out and chatted with us for a while, which definitely made our evening.  Lastly a few things to note, if you have not dined in French/European high-end restaurant then be warned that portions are on the smaller side and you can finish your meal and still be hungry.  This was not us, I needed to walk home after this one.",

Had bone marrow as a starter and it was even better than the one I had in Paris.  Woodcock (15 supplement) for main. Thought it would be a bigger portion but the melt in out mouth texture just justifies the price. Had chocolate and icecream for desert and they were just right and not too sweet.

SO here it is 3 years on, I have hinted my husband to take me there to celebrate my birthdays, and every year I love the experience and beg to come back for another year. The service is impeccable, sometimes it almost feel like there is actually more staff than customers. Everyone there takes time to talk you through the menu, where the food is from (you even get to leave with a map of where the food has been sourced from). Tim Kitchin on every occasion I visited was spotted working away in the kitchen, a good sign as the food was to die for at each visits. When you expect a 3 course meal and in fact it comes with loads of extra, such as a freshly made loaf of bread, just out of the oven, amuse bouche and a consume before your starter, that's what I call a lovely surprise. The portions are not small, just perfect and I must say I am not a shy eater! The menu is always conscientious to provide veg and meat which are seasonal, the presentation is just pure art and I always feel silly as I am busy taking picture of my food in such a well to do environment! Haha I do recall trying to take pictures whilst pretending I was texting so it wouldn't look so obvious, to be fair I'm sure nobody would have cared but I felt a little self conscious! The only thing negative I would say about the place is the price tag on their drinks, a glass of wine can cost easily the price of a bottle of wine in your local pub. I'm lucky I am not a wine snob, despite being french and all so I can comtempt myself with water or just a glass. That being said if you want to go for the full experience they offer deals which include a glass of wine for each courses which are being carefully selected by a sommelier.  My ultimate favourite places in town, be aware the place is fully booked fairly quickly and you often have to book month in advance.",

We asked for a taxi at the end of the night. When the taxi arrived they forgot to tell us and as a result when we got in the taxi the guy had 10 on the meter. The taxi driver then locked us in the cab while he went in to clarify with the receptionist. As a result they came out and paid the 10 to clear the bill.

Everything on his menu is sourced from Scotland, and they even bring you a little map of Scotland in the beginning showing where the ingredients were from.  Presentation and food were beautiful - full of color and much thought to the dishes. Fortunately it was grouse season when I was visiting (October 2013) so I tried it for the first time as my main dish. It was fantastic- cooked perfectly and juicy, I don't know if I've ever had anything better. The ceps starter was amazing as well - perfectly seasoned to bring out the taste of the mushroom. The berry tart dessert was a great way to end the meal.  The best part was at the end when tom himself came out to introduce himself to us. Even though he's become well known, he really seems like a down to earth kinda guy. The whole time I also noticed he was in the kitchen with food preparation and making sure everything was perfect.  I wouldn't hesitate to return, I had an outstanding experience.",

The food sadly didn't impress me as much as I was hoping, but it was a culinary journey I was happy go on for a few hours, especially for the reasonably priced pre-fixe lunch. The service is incredible and the dining room itself maybe one of the most elegant and detailed I've ever experienced.   The mains sort of disappeared into the mix, but the grouse sausage appetizer and the blueberry tart were my two standouts. The grouse was gamey and the sauce reduction added some savoryness while the blood orange gave it some sweetness that was sometimes a little overpowering.   The beef entree was good but unmemorable. A well-cooked piece of steak but an incredibly small portion that was surprisingly lackluster without the other components. The veggies and green sauce worked, but the texture and color of the oxtail was a little off putting as were the large bits in the sauce. Beautifully plated but not a dish I would look forward to again.",

    "text": "The Kitchin is a one Michelin-starred restaurant in Edinburgh that I had the opportunity to try. They offer a variety of menu options, and lunch is an especially good time to come since you can get a two course meal for around 65 pounds.  I decided to go all out - I had their Chef's Prestige tasting menu, which was 6 courses for 185 pounds. It was advertised as using the finest regional ingredients - and the meal even came with a little map of the UK indicating where different ingredients came from.  Our meal started off in the bar with a little finger food - there were some crispy seaweed/rye cracker sticks that you dip into a creamy sauce before you are seated at your actual table.  It started off with a tomato consomme, which was quite nice - a refreshing start and a nice reminder that we're eating seasonally, since tomatoes are harvested towards the end of summer.  Then we had a salmon and caviar dish - this was quite exquisite, and the whole thing was served on a little jelly layer made of shellfish broth.  The third course was when things really picked up for me - it was crisp veal sweetbreads that was creamy and luscious within, with mushrooms around it and a really savory sauce.  The next lobster dish was a wonderful trompe l'oeil - a lobster tail was wrapped in an orange pasta layer, and another fish paste was wrapped in courgette blossom and it looked like carrots and zucchini. Quite the artful presentation.  The savory courses ended with a slice of wagyu and some shredded short rib, which was tasty but nothing special.  The pre-dessert was a meringue with blueberry sauce and a yogurt filling - a little too rich and sweet for a pre-dessert, in my opinion. I was expecting something more palate cleansing. Then the final dessert was a chocolate souffle that they dramatically pour whiskey chocolate sauce into for you. I was much too full at this point and didn't think much of this dish.  Lastly, you're asked if you want tea or coffee - I forgot that it was part of the meal, and declined either, but this is included and they give you a round of millionaire's shortbread to finish off, which was really tasty and sweet, if a bit cloying.  Service was quite expedient. I always appreciate being given a copy of the tasting menu after the fact, but I was mistakenly given a copy of the non-prestige menu - poor form! Our meal was twice as expensive as the regular tasting menu!   The reason why I'm giving this experience four stars instead of five is because I feel like it's not completely worth the price. At this price point, I've dined at Geranium (which had way more innovative dishes) and L'Ambroisie (which had more premium ingredients). I think the savory mains were the best, but the desserts were not well balanced. My tip to you? Come here for lunch and order from one of their smaller set menus - you won't missing out if you miss a dessert or two.",

It started off with us in the lounge with stater flat breads and my husband ordered a beer.  Then about 15 minutes later we were escorted to the dining area.  We both ordered the surprise tasting menu but really wanted the spoots and I really wanted the chocolate souffle to finish.   The waitress said she could make it happen and she did.    Each dish was very flavourful but the spoots were my favourite.  I ended up finding a shot (in my game dish) which I was quite appalled about but they said this is lucky and they called it \"a shot for a shot\" and gave us a shot of a rare whisky whicg my husband benefited from.  We then got to go into the kitchen to meet Tom Kitchin.  They probably felt bad for the shot thing.  They sent us off with a sweet treat that we took home and had for a snack the next day.   This was my first Michelin star event and it didn't disappointment.  I found the courses all heavy so by the end of it I was uncomfortably full and had to walk a couple of miles just to let the food digest.",

    "text": "You have to start someplace -- and for me The Kitchin was my first Michelin starred restaurant. I've been to a lot of nice restaurants over the years but after visiting the Kitchin I realized that there is an even higher standard that a restaurant must reach for in order to attain those coveted stars. (BTW -- Subsequent to my meal at the Kitchin I've been to other starred establishments including a couple of 2 star and one 3 star restaurant. I've never been disappointed. You may not like everything and they won't be perfect, but Michelin starred restaurants are always among the elite of the industry.)  When we dined at the Kitchin a while back they mostly served fish and seafood featuring North Sea delicacies from local fishermen and foragers. We ordered a'la carte. I don't recall all the details of each dish our party ordered, but for me I remember that I started with a ceviche type preparation of razor clams. For my main course I ordered lobster prepared thermidor style. The lobster, alive and kicking, was presented to me table-side before heading back to the kitchen to be transformed into dinner. Lobster thermidor is kind of an old-school recipe -- but it was exquisitely prepared and I enjoyed every bite.  Prior to our arrival I perused the Kitchin's web site and looked over the sommelier's wine recommendations. I was a bit taken back when I got some push back from the som after asking for a wine that was recommended as a great pairing with our entree selections. I'd hate to think he was trying to \"up-sell\" us to a more profitable wine -- because the one we asked for was certainly not at the bottom of the price range on their wine list. We did get what we asked for and in my opinion it paired perfectly well with our entrees.  We finished up with desserts featuring local ingredients -- for me -- a quenelle of sea buckthorn sorbet with a chocolatey cake and kumquat confit.  Every aspect of our experience at The Kitchin -- from the service, to the food, to the decor and comfort level of the dining room -- was exactly what you would expect of a Michelin starred establishment. They may never attain a two or three star rating, but one Michelin star clearly explains my five star Yelp rating -- which, if you look at the corpus of my reviews, are relatively rare from me . ;-)",

Every person was extremely attentive to our needs through the evening and they run a very smooth operation. Every bite of food was mouth watering with incredible flavors and presentation.

    "text": "I come from NYC, one of the most heavily ladened Michelin starred cities in the world. I have eaten is many Michelin starred restaurants and this one just does not compare when it comes to taste.  At first glance, this place is actually incredible. The staff are exceptionally professional, welcoming and attentive. They find a good balance of when to bother you and when to leave you alone. They make sure to refill your wine and your water. they are all well dressed and presentable. they know the menus and dishes well.  The decor is phenomenal. It really offers a fine dining sort of feel. Though the stools with the (hopefully fake) cow fur that you can use to put your purse or jacket is a bit much.  They offer an a-la carte menu as well as a tasting menu (though the a-la  carte menu requires three coures...).  The bathroom: SUPER FANCY  The presentation of the dishes: OUTSTANDING! The chef and his crew and truly artists. The presentations were so impressive I couldn't complain about that  Why did I give it two stars? Because it is truly not worth the money because the food is awful. Now, not everything was awful. Let go through them in order  1) Bread - at the bar they offered these bread crisps that each had their own individual flavor (ie. seawead, oat...I forget the rest). At the table, they offered this great sourdough bread, however, it only had a hint of sourdough flavor and tasted more like...bread.  2) Amouse Bouche: this delicious little sampling of tiny balled carrots and cucumbers in this dill and ginger sauce was intense and amazing. It set the stage for the failure to come  3) Scallops: Again, amazing presentation. They cook it in the shell and put a pastry around the opening which must be cracked open like you are opening up a present. The scallops stew in their own juices which seems like such a great idea. however, at first bite, the mind wonders: where is the taste? It tasted like...nothing. I felt the scallops on my tongue. I broke it down with my teeth and yet...nothing. Was this a mistake? i try another bite, again, nothing. It was literally the prettiest but blandest scallops I have ever eaten in my entire life.  4) Monkfish: Same problem as the scallops. The presentation was beautiful. It was like looking at something from the Museum of modern Art. There was color and texture and excitement from that dish but there was no flavor. I mean..I sort of tasted the saffron..I guess? But it seemed like the key ingredient missing was SALT! The chef did not seem afraid to use other herbs and spices but where was the salt? I need to search the thesaurus for synonyms for the word bland because how many times do I need to say it? It was such a disappointment.  5) Chocolate and coffee dessert with hazelnut praline. This was actually not bad. Super fancy dessert with rich chocolate and coffee and amazing textured offered by the hazelnut. It was nice to end the dinner with this.  Overall, the bill totaled well over 300 dollars for two 3 course meals, a mocktail and a few glasses of wine.   Am I glad to have done it? No Would I recommend this to my friends? No Would I come back? No  In the world of food, you can have all the parts together but if you miss out on TASTE, that is a huge red flag in my book. I do not recommend.",

We had the exclusive tasting with the standard wine pairing; each course was more incredible than the next. Each dish was a unique combination of tastes, ingredients we would never think of putting together that paired beautifully. There were four of us with different tastes and there wasn't a single dish that we didn't ooh and aah over. The somm was not only knowledgeable, but added to the experience by giving us insight into the geography and history of each wine as he served. In our dining history, we've only seen a greater attention to detail (by both the chefs and the wait staff) at the French Laundry - which was an experience but lacked warmth. Everything about the Kitchin was professional but not pretentious. Chef even took the time out for a photo op, which we really appreciated. The Kitchin itself is enough of a reason to come back to Scotland!",

    "text": "Michelin one star?  Me thinks not.  Any star from the Michelin Guide denotes a restaurant that delivers an unparalleled dining experience.  From the sophistication of the food, its presentation, setting and service.  All should be near flawless and representative of the culture.  The Kitchin prides itself on outstanding sourcing of ingredients but combined in a way that makes none stand out.  Perhaps it is the intended goal, but having tried numerous \"regular\" eateries in Scotland prior to the Michelin meal, I never experienced blended flavors.  Don't get me wrong, the food is plenty good just uncharacteristic of a restaurants so dedicated to ingredients.   The meal opens with an assortment of crisp flat bread wafers with a creamy bleu cheese dip.  Some with laver, others with squid ink.  A fun opening act.  The prestarter, a small serving of seafood veloute with raw root veg and bright acidity ready's the palate for more.  To the starters.  Gigas oysters prepared six ways.  Raw, outstanding and showcasing the incredible clean flavor.  Cooked as a Rockefeller, smoked, cut up and mixed with root veg, in a Asian sauce, etc were good on their own but the subtle goodness of the oyster is lost.  A hand dived Orkney scallop baked in shell with white wine, vermouth and a wild herb, butter sauce, vibrant and sweet.  Steaming keeps the scallop tender.  Somewhat over seasoned.  For mains, a very good monkfish tail wrapped in pancetta, served with barely cooked through squid, pan roasted potatoes, foraged mushrooms and scallion with a seaweed sauce.  The Scottish affinity for pairing mushrooms with Seafood continues to impress in its ability to bring out the natural flavors.  The only weakness, the pancetta overpowers the delicate fish.  The lobster stuffed with squid, pancetta, assorted squash and braised fennel, and finished with an escargot butter, outstanding.  Incredible sweetness harmonizes perfectly with the anise flavor of the fennel.  The escargot butter's richness and slight earthiness adds incredible back flavors and surprising umame.  Incredible.   The only True mistake, the lobster \"risotto\".  Sweet, perfectly cooked lobster claw and tail served in a \"risotto\" of potato in a VERY salty seafood broth.  Impossible to eat.  Dish sent back and a replacement, simple, off the menu lobster dish replaced it.  A richly flavored pistachio souffle with chocolate ganache and chocolate chip ice cream, whisky, and petit  fours rounds out the meal.  Service; German efficiency.  Never slowing, never stopping.  Friendly but not providing the relaxed atmosphere one expects for a 3 hour meal.  The wine list is good but lacks in vintage depth.  Prices are very fair with the average bottle price 100.  Overall, reasonable, with dinner for three inclusive of drinks and service, 490.  Three month advance booking required.  Credit card to warranty reservation.  Somewhat disappointed by the hype.  Eclipsed by the chef's other Michelin eatery, Castle Terrace.",

I've been lucky enough to dine at The Kitchin twice before, and this was our visit since it was renovated. The space is bigger and more spacious, and you can have a romantic dinner without feeling cramped or crowded.   We booked months in advance (I believe they book up to 6 months in advance) and got a table for two on a Friday night. I think we needed to leave card details to secure the booking as well as confirm the day before. We arrived early for our booking intending to have a drink in the bar but were shown straight through to our table - no complaints from me as I was hungry!  We started with a cocktail each - I had the apple crumble which is probably the only low point of the evening as it really didn't taste like much. No bother though as by that point they'd popped crisp breads in front of us which were totally delicious.   I knew I was going to have a tasting menu and the waitress mentioned that we didn't need to have the same one, so we decided to have one classic tasting menu (Tom Kitchin's best dishes) and one seasonal, 80 each. And matching wines, 55 each.    I won't go into a dish-by-dish breakdown but there really wasn't a low point for me. I really loved the mackerel tartare marinated in a seaweed and lemon dressing which was served in ice and deliciously refreshing, and the halibut was luscious. I tried most of Graeme's dishes as well, and it was nice to both try something different. The food here really is at a different level and really impressive - I love that feeling of being totally gobsmacked by the flavours when I dive into a dish. We also opted for the additional cheese course because I cannot resist a cheese trolley. The waitress looking after the cheese chose a beautiful selection for us and told us something interesting about each cheese.   Service is friendly, professional and relaxed, there's really no pretense here. I think that's one of my favourite things about The Kitchin - no one wants to eat somewhere stuffy and formal. I have to say that for me, The Kitchin is my favourite restaurant in Scotland - I've always left feeling wowed and delighted by the food. They really do know how to hero Scottish produce and I love that they showcase the seasons at the same time.   Tips: very reasonable lunch menu available at 29.50 for three courses. There's a bar area where you can sit and wait for your taxi at the end of your meal. We'd booked for 6.30pm and they didn't seem to expect to turn the table over which made for a relaxing experience for us.",

    "text": "We're currently visiting the UK and Ireland for our honeymoon and this was one of our special celebration meals. No question the staff here made us feel special from the second we stepped in to the moment we left. Superior service and excellently prepared food. The \"Happy Honeymoon\" welcome card signed by the chef was a lovely touch. From the amuse bouche to dessert, the food was flavorful and inventive -- and all presented by the servers with storytelling and flair. My favorite dish was the in-shell scallops with pie crust. The pace at which the food came out was perfect. Loved the mini map they gave you to take away showing where the ingredients are sourced. This was a True Michelin Star experience all around. I've been to a couple, one in Valencia and another in Dublin so I have restaurants for comparison. I highly recommend this restaurant for all, especially those celebrating milestones.",

    "text": "Did not live up to expectations. Completely overpriced, relative to the experience.  You can mix and match from three different set menus or wing it with their seasonal \"surprise\" tasting course. They offer a veg menu as well but the choices were so uninspired (risotto, puff pastry, or polenta ) we ordered halibut instead. Yes there are unexpected wonderful things like the palette cleanser and \"pre-dessert\" rice pudding (yummy and adorably presented) but the service vacillated between suffocating and nonexistent. We tried three times to order more wine before mains but never saw a server again until they cleared our plates. Missed opportunity to sell is a bottle. Scallop starter, again, well-presented, but was warm at best with most scallops cold. Squid ink pasta undercooked and dry, not al dente. And the chocolate souffle was a total disappointment--think: chocolate microwaved eggs.   Ambience is nice but turn down the lights! Too bright.   Overall, not worth the $300 price tag. Go to Gardener's Cottage instead for better curated food and drink.",

    "text": "Any place that gives my handbag its own seat at the table is going to get looove from me! Yes that actually happened. My 10 Accessorize satchel never had it so good :)  We had a real delight of a meal at this Michelin-starred and recently refurbed resto (made even better by the fact I was being treated eek). We chose 3 courses a la carte and asked the sommelier to match wines for each of us for each course which was quite special and a first for me.  The highlights for me were my scallops starter which arrived baked in the shell and revealed at the table. This was followed by food envy at my neighbour's stuffed lobster main course. I also liked the dramatics of the choc souffle desserts which were also pierced and filled with steaming hot choc sauce right in front of us.  The service was spot on (apart from a long gap before dessert arrived) and the evening topped off by spotting Mr Tom Kitchin himself through the window in the kitchen! It's great to know he really cooks here, and believes in the 'from nature to plate' sustainable philosophy - as evidenced by the cute food sourcing maps of Scotland they had rolled up as scrolls in front of each person.   I would have liked the food to be more specifically memorable for the prices being paid but otherwise this was a top notch eve - would recommend for a special spendy meal as the setting itself is comfortably lush :)",

The menu is innovative and each dish was intriguing. I couldn't decide what to have, so I opted for the chef's tasting menu. Highlights were the baked scallops for starter and grouse for the main. The scallops were perfectly cooked in a tasty butter cream sauce and the grouse was also exquisite. Their reputation speaks for itself and definitely exceeded my expectations.",

I had an apple sorbet with apple slices that was just what I needed after a long day of sightseeing. The one comment I have is that they were almost appalled we were there just for dessert, and still had the wait staff go through setting the table for appetizers, then taking the plates away, setting for dinner, taking that away, and then finally for dessert. I would definitely stress to them that you're just there for dessert so they know. Other than that, it was very lovely, and well worth the $30 I spent on just dessert. Sometimes you just have to splurge. :)",

They had a special where you could replace the fish course with lobster at a little extra, glad I made that decision, it was divine! Great wine list as well, wonderful service and beautiful interiors. The map of Scotland given to us, featuring all the ingredients sourced is fun. As the courses came, we kept going back to the map. It was a tour of Scotland as well as a sensational meal.  I hope I have the opportunity to go back!",
