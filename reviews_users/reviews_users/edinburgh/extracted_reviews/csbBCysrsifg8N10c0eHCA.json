    "text": "I went for a meal here after hearing good reviews of another branch in Cambridge. I have to say it was pretty disappointing. We were ignored on arrival by no less than 6 members of staff and then asked to wait when someone finally did come and speak to us, despite the fact that the place was mostly empty. When he did return he took us to a table, practically grunted and left. Then things picked up somewhat as the waitress who took over was delightful - very helpful and attentive, despite being busy - and we were given menus straight away. The dining experience itself could have been better - the food was fairly expensive for the quality and some things were just plain wrong (I wouldn't advise the hollandaise sauce to anyone). Also, as the ceilings are high and the windows are huge, it's all very noisy and really quite cold. It felt a bit like a pub trying to be a restaurant, if you know what I mean.",

    "text": "What's happened here? This used to be my absolute fave restaurant. Great atmosphere, beatutiful rooms, great food, a really nice Scottish waitress who would conscientiously tell you about the daily specials in a charming way. Weeellll the lovely waitress has gone (where?oh where?) replaced by male staff totally in love with themselves, and not at all interested in seating or serving guests ,the atmosphere is not so great any more (at least in my opinion) but the food. Now this is where I really been having problems lately. The cheeseburger used to be an absolutely reliable staple -last time I went I could hardly eat a quarter of it Never mind the half raw onion thoughtfully placed next to it, it was the meat that really shocked me. I thought maybe better not eat any more, you never know. My partner's salmon was flavourless. Another time we went a side dish of green beans had definitely not seen any boiling water, let alone seasoning. So what is going on here? Cost cutting? A new chef? I have no idea. Come back, old Brown's, I beg you!",

One thing to know if you're planning a meal here in advance: you can't reserve a table, so be warned. In spite of this I've never had a long wait for a table here. They have a wide selection of food and drink, their afternoon tea is delicious. Definitely worth a visit :)",

It's near my old office so have been here for some girlie meals after work and for some business lunches with colleagues.   In both cases I always am left thinking that they don't get it right. It's not cheap and the menu always looks good with interesting dishes but they seem to make them very bland in the execution.   The service is always a bit half hearted as well - I have felt in past that I was an inconvenience to them because I wasn't ready to order in 2 mins flat.   I have now given up on it - I sometimes walk past and think I will try again cos it looks so lovely but have resisted the temptation so far!",

There is a good selection on the menu with something for everyone. The drinks here are very good also, nice cocktails.  It is quite expensive to eat here, and the drinks can be quite expensive too depending on what you buy. The biggest problem for me is that you can't book, you just have to go along and hope for the best, they have you sit in the bar while you wait for a seat. Guess it's a good way of making them more money but a bit annoying if you were looking for a special night out",

Why do I say that - well you don't need to book in advance - the place is so cavernous that I have always been able to get a table. Despite some of the previous comments I have always found the staff to be efficient, friendly and helpful. The food will never win any foodie stars or medals but it is dependable, well executed and tasty. My particular favourite is the fish and chips with minty, mushy peas. It occurs to me also that they must be doing something right - the first time I came across them was in 1978 in Oxford. One thing, important to me at least, that is worth a mention is that they have a good selection of premium gins - key to starting a good meal off well.",

My love affair with Brown's started in Covent Garden a few good years ago. Great food, great surroundings and reasonably priced too but not available north of the border :-(   The Covent Garden place seems to show off their default business model and when I arrived in Edinburgh, it was the first restaurant I took visitors to.  I've been for food a good few times and service and quality is consistent. Sign up to friends of Brown's and you can get sent various, great value deals.   This weekend it was for drinks only. A new work colleague was visiting Edinburgh for a few days and we decided to meet for a drink so I could give him the lowdown on Edinburgh living. It was pouring of rain but we decided to meet in George Street.  Then I started to panic. Yep, Scottish weather is horrific and it was bouncing off the streets. And its graduation ball weekend so bars would be full of pissed, glammed up students (maybe some of mine). Where was going to be great for having a couple of drinks, a chat and in civilised surroundings? Brown's was my saviour. I knew the new colleague was a man who liked his ale (CAMRA membership) and the Caley 80 on tap at Brown's would fit the bill.   We had a great chat and Brown's was good. Yep, it was busy but we got a table easy enough.

A 50 year old woman, in fishnets, taking a photo of all the empty martini glasses that she and her cackling coven had guzzled their way through on a Wednesday afternoon.  This perhaps tainted what seems to be a good if not amazing venue, which can't seem to work out if it's a style bar, a wine bar, a traditional bar, or a restaurant.  This jack of all trades ethos isn't necessarily a bad thing though, as amongst much of the skankhuts on George Street it does have a nice, if slightly processed feel that makes it seem formal yet casual at the same time, and a suitable venue for both a fancy cocktail and a cheese ploughmans.  On that note, I've never eaten here, but did like the look of the menu. Chances are I'll go back one day.",

It was one of the few places on George Street that didn't take reservations (although it has just started to) so you can walk in whenever you like and get a table. I recently came here after a long drive, at 9.30pm thinking the kitchen would be closed (as it was a Tuesday night) but I was greeted with great enthusiasm and invited to look at the menu within minutes of arriving. I asked for the fish of the day - a fish pie, which was delicious. I was even given a poached egg following a conversation with the waiter - it's the small things! The fish pie came with tempura prawns as the chef decided he wanted to play around with the dish, which I loved.  Their cocktails are really nice too, a bit pricey, but good. Their menu is really extensive and they do a brilliant brunch which I highly recommend. Again, there can only be one word for Browns - reliable.",

But unlike a lot of the overly trendy bars and restaurants on George Street, Browns is actually worth it. The decor is charming, its very light and charming. The staff are attentive and well trained.   The menu ranges from salads to steaks, but most dishes are very interesting and the descriptions make your mouth water. It took us both a long time to decide. I went for the Chargrilled Chicken Salad  which was complimented nicely with pear and pine nuts. It was fresh and delicious. There is also a great cocktail menu, but we didn't try any.  I would probably return here on a special occasion as it is quite expensive. However there is usually some great deals available from their website.",

I was the mid Saturday afternoon and just had a bar snack.  There is a kind of tapas option in the bar snacks section, and there was a three for two offer on that. Buttered King Prawns, crab on Ciabatta  and chicken and chorizo skewers were all delicious and filling.   There was a jazz trio playing some live instrumental music which gave the place an even nicer ambience to it. Overall the drink selection, and the tasty food, were not too expensive in comparison to city centre prices.  I'd recommend a visit to this pub and will visit it again should ever get the chance to come back.",

Situated on George street, the restaurant is very central, thus easy to get to, if you're staying in the city.   My only disappointment was with the staff.

There was a mixture of families, couples and even a hen's do. It is a lovely setting with natural light coming in from the ceiling windows and lots of greenery.  It was rather noisy though. I liked the look of the menu, a little bit fine dining, with a few classics as well.  However, for the price, I was rather disappointed with my main of sea bass fillet with sweet potato, roasted courgettes, red onion and black olive dressing for 10.  The waiter had informed that this was a small meal, so if I was really hungry to order a side too.  So, I also ordered some green beans, which were literally just a pot of steamed green beans with no dressing or anything, yet still cost 2.50! All of my vegetables were underdone and the fish was just average.  It still tasted nice, but I feel like I could have cooked the dish better myself.  My friend had fish and chunky hand cut chips, which I'm told was nice, but a bit steep at 12.50 and likewise with the drinks.  I liked the setting, so would possibly go back for drinks, but not for food.",

I'd never been but was super excited- drinks and meal that I don't have to pay for sweet!  How can you go wrong?!  And I absolutely hate having to say that I really wish they had chosen somewhere else.    I've never been to Browns before but the interior is beautiful.  Very classy.  The cocktails and drinks we had were amazing- absolutely perfect.  I ordered the vodka martini and it was perfect.  THE perfect martini.  Everyone else in my group were really happy with their drinks as well.  And then the food arrived, and that's when things went downhill.  We started with the sharing platter and it was just a bunch of food thrown on a plate.  It didn't look appealing or tasty, it was just there.  I've had better.  For the mains we ordered duck, lobster, steak, and salmon (hey we weren't paying, and isn't the saying go big or go home).  The duck was extremely fatty and covered in layers of grease.  Now duck is usually fatty, but the amount of grease on this plate was out of control.  The lobster tail was small and covered in so much butter you could barely taste the natural flavours.  My coworker who ordered the salmon couldn't even eat it, she said it was so terrible.  And my boss had the steak.  She ordered it medium and it came out blood rare.  The server took it back to get it cooked up; it came back 30 minutes (30 minutes!!) later burned to a crisp.  It was really disappointing.    I always try places twice if I didn't like it the first time, so I'll go back for the food again.  And I'll definitely go back for cocktails, because they really were fantastic (also apparently they do drink deals at certain times).  The service was fantastic, I have to say.  But for everything that was right during our evening, it was just disappointing that the food was so wrong.",

The food was delicious, there was an even spread of meat-based and vegetarian dishes to choose from for both courses. I opted for the Baby Spinach, Avocado and Bacon salad for starter followed by the Monkfish wrapped in Prosciutto for main course (from the 14.95 selection)... I was not disappointed!  Although the cocktails may be a tiny bit on the pricey side, the first-rate service, great food and relaxing yet stylish ambience created by the live pianist made an excellent and highly-recommendable combination for roughly 20-25 a head.  I will be heading back there soon to sample their Brunch and Afternoon Tea menu...",

Apparently, they had just undergone a one-month refurbishment and we had come on reopening night. I must say that the whole restaurant looked beautiful--with plush jewel tone furnishings, mirrors, fresh floral arrangements and brass accents. Very luxe and updated. I have no idea what it looked like before--our waiter told us the restaurant had been around since 1973 so I imagine that the remodel was much needed. We were greeted with flutes of champagne and Scottish smoked salmon canapes. We started with the whole baked Camembert which came to the table hot and bubbling with toasted baguette fingers for dipping. I ordered their famous steak & Guinness pie which looked like it came straight out of a storybook. The pastry top is was a glossy golden brown. The stew inside was delicious. The steak was simmered in Guinness for six hours so it was perfectly tender. It came with a side of buttery mashed potatoes and a rich gravy. Such a comforting meal yet presented so nicely. My companion had the roast pork belly which came with the crackling, a savory apple pie, mash & gravy and green beans. Traditional Scottish meal--totally hit the spot on a drizzly Edinburgh night!",

The staff made the time to chat to you as they were making your drinks and offered to bring them to your table if you were going to be waiting longer than a few minutes (if they had to go get fresh supplies etc).

Not only the entire restaurant but the service. Eye contact and gentle check ins to see all ok. I've had the crab & king prawn linguine --- beautifully cooked (nice al dente pasta). And had a side of broccoli with hollandaise and Stilton on the side. All with a large class of gorgeous Malbec.   Truly divine.",

We ordered two teas-for-two, which allows you to choose your own pot of tea and comes with quite the assortment of snacks. There are three kinds of finger sandwiches, a warm scone with clotted cream and jam, a chocolate-covered cream puff, a meringue, and a piece of fruit cake.  The inside is really pretty, with high ceilings and glass for sunlight to come in. It felt very classy, but was affordable. Altogether a great experience.",

Browns is one of those places we seem to have been going to for years, and I'm not entirely sure why; probably just habit. We came here on Mothers day as we were struggling to find places that were child friendly.   On the positive side - it's quite a nice venue. It's large, bright and airy. There was  a piano player twinkling away on some Elton John tunes in the corner.   It was Sunday so we ended up having the roast dinner option. I had pork belly and apple; it wasn't bad but the sharing platter of vegetables were pretty cold and the green beans like rubber. My dessert, a brownie and ice cream, was as you'd expect - but others weren't so lucky with some key components inexplicably missing. The childrens portions were *huge*.  The service staff were friendly; but there were long periods of waiting and they didn't wipe the table after the main course. It also took 3 attempts to get the bill correct.  My Mum did seem to enjoy it though which counts for a lot and most of the food was fine. If it was a quieter day and you ordered something safe from the menu (like a burger), I think Browns would probably be nice enough.",

    "text": "Last Sunday I promised my guest that he needs to try out the traditional full breakfast!   Our first choice was fully booked by 10:20, plus there was a waiting queue, so after some wandering in Rose street where most places would open at 11:00 or 12:00 (not the most typical brunch places, True that), we ended up in Browns!   I really liked the setting inside Browns - we got seated on the right side (up 3-4 stairs), quite open area. There was plenty of space further inside too with roof windows lightening the area, but we couldn't sit there, till the breakfast area was full.   My guest got the full breakfast and he was delighted with it, although he skipped the black pudding, but for his own personal reasons, not that there was something wrong with it.  My partner got the vegetarian breakfast - both breakfast options were accompanied by proper bread, slightly toasted to get the crispy crust. They both enjoyed it (I could tell from the empty dishes!)  I got the eggs royale option: smoked salmon and hollandaise sauce on top of a bagel! Nom, nom!   Their orange juice was not fresh, but that's acceptable from a bar. The coffees were good, but nothing special.   Everything was cooked well, and we got our tummies full!   It was a pleasant surprise also finding out the hidden deal: 2nd breakfast for free!   I think I'll go back for some more in the future! ;-)",

    "text": "So I love the eggs benedict here but I think the buck stops there.   I had acquired a voucher for 5 off a main so me and another mama ventured to browns with our toddlers and a baby in tow. It was a good deal cause we both had vouchers which (depending on your main)  could mean lunch for 2 pounds! Not bad!   We both got the chicken and avocado sandwiches (possibly cause we are both Cali girls). The chips are thin and very yummy but the sandwich was a mess and the chicken was dry and hardened at places. Kind of a let down. The seasoning was fine but the actual ingredients didn't seem to work well. The focaccia bread wasn't adequate and broke apart. The sandwich just didn't work for me. I was bummed but not too bummed cause I ended up spending about 3 on lunch, which is quite alright!  If I had paid full price I would have been pissed and not in the drunken sense if you catch my drift ;)  Also, the kids meals/portions are HUGE!!! If you are dining with a toddler or smaller child probably best sharing your meal and adding a veggie side.",

    "text": "I have been to Browns a handful of times, always wanting to give it another go based on a recommendation and always walking away wondering why I did.  Every time I have been here I have had food which is mediocre at best. It does a job but doesn't exactly do it well.  My most recent visit was no different - everything we ordered turned up greasy and on a bed of mayo. Did we choose poorly?  Definitely. But come on.  The fish cakes were about 95% potato and the sweet potato wedges were enormous slices of sweet potato which must have been boiled first as they were (mostly) cooked through but were soft instead of coming across as baked or fried, albeit covered with a layer of oil.  Very confusing and resulting in not a nice dish.  The chorizo sausage roll was dripping in oil (bad choice on our part but really poor menu choice on Browns part), which left is with only the Cesar salad which was fresh and well dressed.  On top of the food, the service was close to abysmal. Our server brought ice water when I asked for no ice (I know, and by itself it wouldn't matter but paired with the rest...), then never returned to refill our glasses when they were empty.  In fact, the next time we saw her after our food was deposited was when we hunted her down for the bill.  Even then she didn't clear our dishes and instead opted to do so once she brought our change and we were in the process of leaving, which felt weird and almost as though we were being guilted into leaving a greater tip.   I think I've given Browns enough chances.  There are plenty of half decent places to get food on George St, no point in returning to one which can't even deliver the half.",

    "text": "It was a weekend evening during festival time = probably no surprise that the service was slow. A long wait to order, a longer one for the bill and the wait staff generally looked overstretched and rushed off their feet.  Luckily we'd come with patience, being grateful just to have found somewhere convenient that wasn't fully booked! We had to wait 30mins in the bar first which was fine to get started on cocktails, and I liked that they give you one of those flashing vibrating things to call you when your table's ready. Minimal fuss!  The barman was also a little slow and had to look up some of our cocktails but my Secret Garden was worth waiting for. I did have to siphon off a bunch of ice though as the barman seemed to think the finishing touch for all of them should be to pile it up on top of the glass. Fail. Also skip the You Rang M'Lord - my sister claimed it was delish, but it really wasn't :P  Once at the table the annoying thing about waiting to order was that two separate waiters told us they'd be with us 'in one minute' but ten mins later we were still waiting. They may need some tips on managing expectations - I'd prefer they said nothing if they weren't coming back!  Our eventual waitress turned out to be very sweet and we couldn't hold it against her. The mood was also saved by the food: gorgeously gooey baked camembert sharer with dunkable bread first, followed by fish and chips for me - lightly battered and served with fat chips and a yum pea puree. My sisters were also happy with their chicken (with potato rosti and veg), and lamb, mint and feta burger (with skinny fries).  The menu was huge and varied though and overall this is reliable, crowd-pleasing food in a grand old brasserie-style setting. A good fallback to take the family for a nice meal out if you're not inspired by (or can't get a table) anywhere else on George St.",

Evidently I am not the only one, often see people doing the same or having a morning meeting over breakfast.  The service is friendly and attentive (especially for someone who'll come in for a breakfast and linger for a couple of hours!).  So if you're looking for a place for a breakfast meeting, or just need a space to send some emails over some tasty food, Browns is a great bet.",

We popped into Browns, it wasn't too busy at 7pm on Friday which was a nice surprise and meant that the service was superquick - the food arrived before our drinks! I had the steak and guiness pie with mash and the boy had a pasta dish.  Both were lovely and we shared a nice bottle of red. The icing was definitely the chocolate brownies for desert. Huge and delicious.  We shared two - one dark chocolate and the white chocolate and raspberry one. I will definitely go back.",

    "text": "Yum yum yum yum.  Browns is a gastropub, so obviously most of the menu is a bit over-priced, but I hardly care because it's so good. The servings are a bit on the modest side, which is perfect for me but might put off a more grizzly bear-esque appetite. I always get the lobster dishes and my partner always gets steak. Both are perfect every time. The lobster pasta is ridiculously delicious, and much to my pleasant surprise, not stingy on the lobster. The lobster salad sandwich is also amazing, with just the right balance of a generous heaping of lobster, crunchy veg, and crispy bread which holds the sandwich together well but doesn't overpower the other ingredients.  The steak is always cooked perfectly, and the sides are fab as well. The cocktail menu is creative and really tasty (though the sweeter cocktails are quite sweet, so if sugary alcohol isn't your thing you might want to ask them to go light on the more sugary ingredients). The service is always friendly and attentive, and more easy-going than the posh interior of the place would lead you to expect. There's occasionally live piano music coming from the back of the restaurant - pleasant but not enough to drown out your conversation.  Browns is one of our very favourite date night spots, and it's probably a good thing for our budget that we don't live too near it.",

As usual the front of house was welcoming, even though the place at lunchtime was rather busy. As I was having a business lunch I got the Fish & Chips (cod) with pea and mint puree, tartar sauce & chunky chips. The two pieces of cod were very tasty and the lightly battered coat was perfectly crispy, a real delight. Chips and tartar sauce passed the test too. Thanks to the strong O2 WiFi I was able to complete some reports in-situ, and after that the very well deserved pint(s) of Amstel lager to wash down the whole lot. Even though food prices range from average to the upper side, alcoholic drinks are, as expected in George Street, rather expensive.  The service was good, professional and efficient as always. Will certainly go back, keep up the good work!",

On Sundays they offer their signature cocktails for 5 in the afternoon, which is a seriously good deal considering the quality of cocktails. There's also a guy playing the grand piano - nice!  We also had the afternoon tea and were duly presented with sandwiches, warm scones and cakes. For 7 a head it was good value, but the quantity of food is on the small side, so make sure to eat your lunch before popping along for your tea and cakes! My mistake was in not eating before arriving.   To plug the gap I had some chips - they were amazing! The best chips I've had for ages and ages. They came wrapped up like a chip shop poke and were so tasty I would have happily ordered another plate. Yum!",
