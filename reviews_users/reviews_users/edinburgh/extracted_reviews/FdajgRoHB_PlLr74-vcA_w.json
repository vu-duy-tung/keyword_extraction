    "text": "Talk about kit and kaboodle. This place is lit fam.  . (Mike drop).   That's how my stupid grand son Garrett tAlks. This all started when I was invited to his bachelor party. So Ilong story short, I've historically attended all y sweet boys bachelor party's.   So now Garry is married to Ari. She's an adequate addition to our family. I wanted him to marry that big boot beeZy from the Bronx. But that was Jennifer from block.   Ok so this pizza place is fantastic. I'm a bit of a pizza snob in terms of evaluation of crust, sauce, toppings, presentation and cooking method.   Crust- crush was not overly abundant, but soft where it needed to be. I will add in the restraint they have pizza oil BUT NOT FOR TAKING THE OIZZA BACK TO OUR CASTLE THE MCCRAY FAMILY IS IN. Being immigrants from South Italy we don't root for the flying Scotsman. Actually. In Portland Oregon, there is a Scottish unipiper. He rides around on a unicycle and plays a flame throwing bagpaipe.   Sauce was a fresh tomatoe.  Not overly zesty, but A- consistency. Only A+ I've seen is the boy my granddaughter married. He's a True stallion. Probably the best slice of beef this side of the Mississippi.   Toppings were average. Nothing special.  Crust was fine.   So this is an update. I went back in the morning but they weren't open at 8AM. I enjoy a morning lasagna from time to time so I went to the bakery about 30 minutes away.   You CAN BET YOUR BOTTOM POUND I'll be back  Ok I'm leaving Edinburgo ok    Ezekiel 23:19-21",

Last time I'd had the calzone which was only ok, not sure but for me ricotta in a calzone just doesn't work well, my personal preference only maybe.  Second time I had the pizza with rocket, mozzarella balls and sun dried tomatoes. Pizza base delicious and glad I'd asked for extra provola.",

    "text": "This review is for takeaway only, however, I would assume that you get the same friendly and welcoming service when eating in. It's a new pizzeria on the block and you get authentical Italian pizza with an awesome chewy and soft dough. The choice on the menu is limited,  however, I was advised by Francesco that I can also add on items not on the menue. So in the end I ended up with a 12\" pizza for 8.20 and additional toppings not mentioned on the menue. I can only recommend you ask what you want and the friendly and attentive staff will advise.  The pizza flavour was unique and less fatty than the pizzas you get from other shops. I think they use Virgin Oil.  The interior is pretty plain,  but very Italian style: White walls,  wooden tables and chairs, birra moretti on tap, Italian style pizza kitchen, very clean throughout.   Apparently Pizzeria 1926 is part of Locanda de Gusti, just opposite the road. So you can be sure that what you get has taste, class and good quality ingredients.  Good thing is that there is plenty of space,  but would think that also in future this place will be booked out easily enough!",
