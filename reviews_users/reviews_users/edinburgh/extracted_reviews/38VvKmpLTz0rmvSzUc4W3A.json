The menu is vast, and so we just ordered several items from the menu. We even shared a table with a random pair.   If there is something that you really really want, then try to arrive early, since they do run out of items as the night gets late. There were two items we wanted but they said that they already sold out that night.  In any case, this was good. If you want a break from haggis, then this is a good choice. The neighborhood looks shady at first, since it is quiet and dark, compared to Leith Walk, but you should be fine.",

We've now been here a number of times and really like it.   They do really nice dumplings, my favourite probably being the salmon and prawn one. The duck rolls are really good. And we've tried some of the stir fry noodle dishes. Most recently I went for the chicken rice porridge. I'd never had it before and really liked it.   It's nice to have a good dim sum in Edinburgh. This place is off the beaten path but doesn't disappoint. The service could be a bit warmer, but that's easily forgettable once you've gotten your first plate.",

    "text": "We have yet to find a Chinese food place that makes up for our local closing, so decided to try Stack, although knowing it's not the greasy, fulfilling Chinese we long for. We ordered take-out and wanted to ensure it was enough food for two people, so we ordered 4 of the dim-sum and one of the glutinous rice bowls. We had the #1 Prawn Dim sum, #10 Ribs and Black Beans from the steamed menu and then the #23 Fried Squid Cake and the #24 Vietnamese Spring Rolls from the fried menu. All were delicious, especially the prawn and the Vietnamese Spring Rolls.   The ribs were also good, but quite fatty and lots of small bones, so I was slightly turned off by eating those. The rice congee, #52 was good and hearty, but seemed to lack any salt or real flavour. I would say it would be excellent for a someone with a cold, but not an amazingly flavourful option. They did serve it with deep fried bread dough, which was so tasty.   Overall, a delicious meal, but it wasn't nearly enough food for two people. It just wasn't super filling, but we imagine it is a great dine-in option if you have some friends to share it with and some time to linger. It is a bit pricier then most takeaway's, but it's a bit different then just getting sweet and sour chicken, and definitely worth the tasting.   Also, they don't accept card under 25 pounds, so make sure to bring cash.  Oddly enough, they serve a wine called Forge Mill, which I discovered at The Dogs, and have been hunting to find locally ever since. A great wine and I am excited they sell it. Definitely a place I will only dine-in from now on to get the experience, which I think makes them a great eatery.",

This small place just off Leith Walk serves absolutely delicious food and it's a great place to go with a group of friends, order a few things from the menu and share. You get a bit of everything to try.   The menu has so many tasty things that it can be difficult to choose initially.. So far I have sampled various dumplings, char sui bun, slow braised chicken claws (yes they are delicious and again the collagen factor is one the benefits of eating this delicacy), tender braised pork pot rice, slow braised beef in with noodles in a broth. All home made and yummy. One of my favourites is the braised pork pot rice - it is just comfort food in a bowl. Also the beef noodle soup has really good flavours.   They do a nice home made spicy chilli paste which goes well with most of the dishes.   Go and try for yourself, you won't be disappointed.",

The menu is small which you know means everything is made fresh in house. Ate here loads when it opened but got a little bit jaded after going so much. They use free range eggs and you can tell this a bit better than your normal quality of Cantonese food.  Mens toilets are a little weird, you can't sit on it without angling your legs around at an angle. Open til 9 which is handy if you want a late night dim sum fix.",

The food itself was alright... but nothing I can't buy for cheaper from the Asian supermarkets and make myself at home... The sticky rice from the A.S is actually much better than the ones at Stack...   The menu/selection isn't great.. and I had quite a large selection of the options... but nothing was overly stand-out...  There was no condiments to go with my dim sims...  The service, considering there was 3 tables while we were there, was pretty slow and I physically had to get up to get the attention of the waitress to order more food...  I was excited that there was a dim sim restaurant in Edinburgh.. but I won't be hurrying back to Stack... There is apparently one other place in town that offers dim sim... so I shall try there next time...",

As well as the standard fare, there are plenty of more unusual options like chicken claws and congee. The flavours are big without being salty and none of the dishes were particularly greasy.  The asparagus and salmon dumplings were a bit of a highlight and I'm a sucker for squid cakes (\"smashed\" squid, if you believe the menu) and these flash-fried little packages of loveliness are a delight.  The obvious comparison is with Chop Chop, and I'm certainly not saying Stack's food is better (extensive and repeated research of both restaurants would be necessary before I committed like that). In terms of service though, Stack wins hands down. And, unless you're going for the banquet at Chop Chop (which I always find to be TOO MUCH PRESSURE) Stack's certainly better value.",

As far as authenticity is concerned, Stack remains quite faithful to tradition: all of the familiar favorites are present on the menu.  That said, if you've experienced real dim sum in Asia or in the US before, Stack just doesn't quite cut it. The flavors, textures and freshness just aren't comparable to that of genuinely good dim sum. On the other hand, we are in Edinburgh, and I therefore think that Stack deserves a lot of credit for simply existing. If it were in New York, California or Hong Kong, Stack would deserve a couple of stars at best. However, since it's one of the only (and possibly the best) dim sum joints in town, it gets the extra star.",

I have eaten quite a few Dim Sums around Edinburgh and this is by far the best Dim Sum restaurant in Edinburgh. The Dim Sums are made fresh everyday. The place is small and only has about 8 tables but I guess you do have the personal attention. The menu of the Dim Sum is not extensive, but the quality of each Dim Sum is superb. I suppose they are aiming for the 'make a few but make it really good' concept. There is only one chef and a waitress and the waitress is really friendly and willing to help you with the choice of your Dim Sum. The speed of the food that comes out of the kitchen is really fast as well once you place your order so you don't have to wait long. I hope more people learn about this place as the location is horrendous as it out of the main road. All I can say is you will never regret a visit to this place for food.",

We ordered 2 dim sum each (4 of us), so had a decent selection of the menu to try - including the chicken claws which were really only ordered out of curiousity and whilst not disgusting, I probably wouldn't order again (you spend more time picking bones out your mouth than eating the claw).   The menu suggests ordering 2 dim sum each and a rice/noodle dish - I had the rice broth with marinated pork and 'thousand year' egg, which was fairly bland and the egg was cut up so the experience of eating the unappetising looking preserved egg was lost somewhat. It wasn't bad, and would definitely make good comfort food, like a rice porridge, but nothing exciting. The other 3 went to order 3 noodle dishes but the waitress advised that this was a bit much (despite the advice on the menu), so we got 2, and she was right - these were big portions.  I've given Stack 4 stars, despite my apparently negative review because it was good. The dim sum were tasty and perfect for sharing. The tablet with photos of the dishes in addition to the printed menu was great too. And prices are reasonable. We'll be back, but possibly won't order chicken claws or rice broth again!",

It's a small restaurant with a basic but dated interior however the steamed dim sum were good.  Wasn't overly keen on the buns although the noodles and rice were lovely and all washed down with a bottle of beer.   The service isn't overly friendly and it's almost a little cold, but they do have a interactive tablet menu along with the regular paper menu to show you what the dishes look like.  I thought that was pretty helpful for any dim sum newbies.   The dishes came out one by one and at different times, so it's a bit like tapas, we just shared the dishes, enabling us the try a little bit of everything.  Now I'm no dim sum connoisseur but I've been to an amazing dim sum almost fast food restaurant in China Town, New York but the portions and style of dumplings were a little different to our wee Leith establishment.  Not what I was used to.  I was expecting bigger dumplings, with more juices and bite.    All in all, this place is still good but I'm yet to find a dumpling that will match the NY dumpling house!",
