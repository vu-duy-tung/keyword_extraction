    "text": "We came here after watching Dunkirk at the cinema upstairs as it was slightly cheaper than Nando's and they had their weekday two courses for 10 deal on. We had decided to order a starter and a dessert to share so that we both got a taste of three courses. We were seated immediately and promptly ordered drinks. They came quite quickly and we ordered our food.  For the starter, we decided to get the potato skins with bacon and cheese which were pretty good but very hot!  For the main course, I had a calzone stuffed with pepperoni, meatballs, mozzarella and tomato sauce which was actually really nice, for a chain restaurant. The mozzarella especially was very good.  For dessert, we went for the hot brownies with cream - these were especially good! The cookie flavoured ice cream went very well with the chocolate brownie and the whipped cream was great too.  The waiters and waitresses that served us were polite and efficient. The restaurant was only about half full but the service was a little bit slow. The wait wasn't really too bad though.  The only negative would be that the Wi-Fi did not work at all. I tried three times and I could not get a connection to the network. I tried the Slug & Lettuce Wi-Fi too at it didn't work either. Hopefully they will fix this to impress future customers.",

I understand how a restaurant can be understaffed but a one hour wait with no food is unacceptable. What made matters worse is our server never came to the table once during that time to give us an update on our order.  2 of our children ordered Macaroni and Cheese which when served looked like it came directly out of a box. My wife's Chicken and Ribs combo meal was ( chicken skin burned and ribs dried out) again , unacceptable. My 10\" pepperoni pizza was passable and our 3rd daughters meal was also passable. The waitress was obviously over worked this evening but I just don't see how this overcomes a bad meal and extremely long wait times. Too many good local restaurants in the area , give this place a pass.",

Eaters can find a selection of starters, main courses, and desserts. It is a casual diner with friendly service- our waitress was very accommodating to our needs. The mushroom starter was SO GOOD... like I used the garlic sauce from this for my potato skins... it's obsessive. The Chicken Penne Romana was decent. It had bacon, pepperoni, chicken, and arugula. I love all the the ingredients listed so I enjoyed this. Everything else was just average... The taste of the food was alright, without the lunch special prices the food would be super over priced!!!",

My only critasismy would have to be a lack of ambiance. There wasn't any music which was a little bit wired, but a part from that the food was very good.",

This is what they ask for as they really like Frank & Bennys  (not his specific restaurant)   I was a bit taken back that they only do paper gift vouchers, not a pre-loaded card. And they only do them in 5 denominations.   It took about 10 minutes in total which as fine, but when the manager came back with the vouchers, they were loose and not in a card or envelope, it was just a bit like the least possible effort.",

    "text": "I have been to Franky & Benny's before - normally I find them A-OK; nothing much to write home about in the general sense, but occasionally some great dishes (anything with Italian herb potatoes was a good shout) and decent value for a chain Italian.  However this visit to this location really let the whole side down. Wow. The day after Boxing Day, it was of course busy with shoppers hitting the sales or folk like us popping in for a bite to eat before a festive-season movie. However you'd be forgiven for thinking the staff had never seen it busy before - I find that hard to believe in a location is central as the Omni Centre in Edinburgh. The kitchen (where we were seated near to) seemed to be struggling to get dishes out, whilst the waiting staff stood about seemly unable to realise that their customers were experiencing some of the worst service they had seen in ages.  Admittedly, our service was not terrible - they did get our food out quickly, but it took an age to take our initial order, and trying to get the attention of any passing waiter for the bill took 20 minutes in itself. I was extremely close to missing our movie so was tempted to simply leave an estimated amount. When the food did come, it was a mixture of overcooked and not-too-bad-actually. Meh indeed.  But we were surrounded by groups having a far worse time than us. The mother and daughter beside us had been waiting for their appetisers when we arrived, and were still waiting on their main when we left over an hour later. At least they received a number of apologies, which is more than can be said for the group of 4 in front of me. They had actually got up to leave when their main courses finally showed up; they sat back down to eat but were none too happy about the situations. I obviously can't speak for F&B's in terms of saying what was causing all the issues, but the staff didn't seem particularly bothered enough to stop standing around chatting to one another by the tills, avoiding eye contact from the unhappy patrons.  Must do better.",

    "text": "It's just an average restaurant.  The waiter was nice and polite. The atmosphere is just as any other American restaurants.  We have a group of 6 so I can taste 6 different dishes in one time.  \"Spaghetti pomodoro\" was not as good as I thought. The tomato sauce was very dry. There isn't even sauce in the plate. The flavor of it was light. I wasn't very sure where the tomato flavor is.  \"Spaghetti carbonara\" was better. But again, the dress is very dry.  I couldn't see what dressing was in the plate again. Even if we added much cheese on top of it, can't really add any flavor of it. \" ham and mushroom pizza\" was the best of the day even if the scorched a little bit.  All other pasta taste really the same. I guess the main reason is that the dressing is too dry.  The hamburger was not juicy. Another thing was that the waiting time was sooooo long. Go there if you really have time.  There are a lot of restaurants near there and taste almost the same.",

After having few pizzas and seafood, it was clear that F&B tries to compromise between these two kitchen styles without succeeding in neither. There are definitely better pizza & pasta places out there, and seafood seemed to be typical frozen stuff that food industry is pushing into home freezers. In summary, the food we had was nothing special that I would not be able to cook myself. Regretting that we ate in this place as there were better places nearby.",
