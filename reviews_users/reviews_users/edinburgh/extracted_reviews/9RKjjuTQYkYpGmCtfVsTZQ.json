    "text": "Los Cardos - Mexican munchings on Leith Walk  So, just a quick post on this one, as I wanted to get the word out about how much I enjoyed my box of food which I picked up last Tuesday night. My rather excellent personal trainer Tracy Griffen recommended   Los Cardos to me last week, but they'd just closed for the day by a whisker when I popped by , so a second attempt was made and was a success. Still open, I was gonna get me some dinner.  Los Cardos opened a few of weeks ago on Leith Walk, on the block between Dalmeny Street and Jameson Place. It's a little takeaway shop, with a couple of seats for if you want to eat in. The very friendly people behind the counter talked me through the menu  - so many tempting choices, so it was a bit of a dilemma on the picking front. The had steak, chicken, pork, pinto and black-eyed beans, and all sorts of fab veggie bits, guacamole and salsa to top and dress the burritos, or tacos, whatever takes your fancy.  Kind of knackered from my work-out, I realised that my decision making powers were a little useless, and the only thing I could really decipher from my brain was that I was very hungry, and heck, all of it looked good. I think I muttered something along the lines of 'chef's choice' and so I took home a tasty box filled to the brim of their rice ,beans, carnitas of pork which is braised in their tangy salsa verde, some lettuce, sour cream, cheese....Anything else? Um, nope, I think that was all. Their tag-line is 'Fresh Mex', and it was definitely the best takeaway dinner I've had in a long time; really nice home-made tasting food. Only, the beauty is that they take care of stocking all of the millions of component dishes, and I just have to provide the plate and cutlery when I get back to the house. Sweet deal or what? My only gripe is that their drinks fridge (as giant and plentifully filled as it was) didn't seem to offer a huge choice beyond sweet sticky sodas, energy drinks and water. It'd be cool it if they struck up a deal with some local fresh juice company. Maybe they do their own ? Will check it out next time.  Unsurprisingly, Los Cardos has already recruited a loyal legion of fans; not bad going in three weeks!  Anyway, they're waiting for their website to be finished, but in the meantime here's the link to their Facebook page, which has the current contact details. In FB-speak, Leila Likes this (giant thumbs up).  ps - Word is they also do MacSweens legendary haggis as a filling. Why, it's so loco it might just work!

I also came here with a couple friends and it was our last meal together and the staff was so kind to offer to take our pictures for us when they saw us struggling to take a selfie, haha. I've eaten at restaurants with burritos done poorly but Los Cardos is not one of those restaurants!!!",

If you like burritos this is definitely the place to go in Edinburgh (Illegal Jacks is also quite nice but I feel Los Cardos has the slight upper-hand, having had both restaurants' burrito offerings several times).    My personal favourite is the la carnitas, which is a slow-roasted pork.  You get a generous helping of rice, beans, meat, sour cream (which is free unlike at Illegal Jacks) and a choice of three-to-four different types of salsa ranging from mild to hot.  The chicken burrito is also highly recommended. I have not tried the steak or the veggie burritos.    Los Cardos also offers tacos, fajitas and quesedillas for those who prefer something other than a burrito.  You can also get a loyalty card, which after 5 stamps gets you free nachos and salsa, and after 10 stamps gets you a free burrito (or any of the other foods they offer).  And two can dine for roughly 11!!  We usually get takeaway but you can also sit in as there are a few tables. Seating is limited though.  Definitely recommend Los Cardos for one of the best burritos in Edinburgh!!",

A trip into Los Cardos has become a regular Thursday night treat after a fitness class - it's right near my flat, so I can run in, get my chicken-with-peppers-and-guacamole burrito, and get home while it's still warm and scrummy. Mmmm. My reward card fills up fast. They did laugh at me when I admitted I eat my burrito with a knife and fork mind you... but I'm a messy eater, I'd get it everywhere otherwise!",

I love the fact that this place is the only Mexican place around here but yet manages to keep the prices in sensible range. I hate it when restaurants bump up the prices just because they can, but I honestly don't think I would mind paying a couple of extra quid for this heaven wrapped in a tortilla experience!  It isn't a huge place so you might be hard pushed to find a table but if you wait it out, it's worth it, or just grab something to take home. They even do a haggis burrito, which sort of turns my stomach and enthrals me at the same time. I'll stick to chicken!",

I was lucky enough to be able to get a seat, but there are lliterally only a handful, so you have to time it right! They also have a loyalty card, which must be great for the people who live near. (can you hear the pang of regret at living just that bit too far away?) My only complaint is that they don't deliver to my side of town yet. I can live in hope though",

You basically choose one of the above followed by the filling of your choice (vege option available too) with rice, sauce (ranging from mild to extra hot) and extras like cheese, sour cream and guacamole. The decent size of burrito makes this excellent value. My favourite has to be the pork filling with the haggis filling close behind.",

    "text": "It's about time Edinburgh had Mexican worth eating. On a tip from a friend, my wife, baby and I trekked down Leith walk to Los Cardos. Momma was probably too hungry by the time we got here, and I already had a broken toe causing me to limp. But, it was worth it. We're SoCal natives living in Toronto... you know what Toronto doesn't have? A lot of Mexican options... and I don't know if I've seen a burrito worth being a burrito there. Sure, Mexican inspired wraps, which are tasty, but not if you bite into them thinking it's a burrito. And Edinburgh? I once had a burrito which was like a pot roast in a tortilla (store bought tortilla at that). So... WOW, this was one of the most satisfying and tasty burritos I've had in a long while AND it is in Edinburgh. Maybe I'm inflating the star rating due to the inverse relationship of quality to distance from Mexico or from California or Texas (both places where I've lived most of my life, so I feel i have some sense of burritos)... but, if you're not as burrito-starved as me, maybe it's a 4 or 4.5. Fine, you can have that. I'm just happy to eat a great burrito.",

I got the red tractor chicken (which of course turned into a red tractor, yellow tractor tongue twister, you try it!!) in a fajita burrito with all teh trimmings and lashings of soured cream!   The only downside I found is that you only get napkins and plastic forks, which I can understand given that it's mainly just a take away with seats. As I sat in though, I could have done with a knife.   Will definitely be coming back here!",

My only criticism would be that the filling wasn't particularly evenly spread, so it was a dish of stages, rather than each mouthful being well-balanced.  Overall, we said: \"The bottom line is that I thought the Los Cardos burrito was mighty tasty. It didn't rock my world to its very core, but I would happily return and I'd happily eat it again. I really enjoyed sitting in, too, as the simple seating area is lovely, with bright walls and elegant cornicing. I'd definitely recommend a visit. Their quality is good, and the welcome extremely friendly.\"",

That and the prices are really reasonable, you'll get much more for your buck than from most other takeaways. Another great thing is that the packaging is eco-friendly.  Personally I like to get the quesadillas, and dip it in Extra Hot salsa, with a little sour cream (good that they don't charge extra for this, although there is a charge for guacamole). My boyfriend's a fan of the burritos, which are huge. I've even got a jar of the Roastin' Red in my cupboard.  The food is great, but I can't bring myself to give it 5 stars.  Firstly, the Just Eat menu does not have the full menu - it's missing the tacos. I really enjoyed being able to have one chicken, one steak, one carnitas etc but no more. Secondly, the most recent quesadilla I got was cut into two very thick slices rather than three slimmer ones and as a result much more difficult to eat. And thirdly, because I moved that wee bit too far away to go and collect it and instead rely on delivery, I'm not able to use my loyalty card anymore (I did ask). When I lived over the road from it I was racking up stamps like nobody's business, but now the card is sitting in my purse unused. Boo. I appreciate it's difficult to verify how many stamps someone has before you order (do you bring free tortilla chips with you just in case they're about to receive stamp five?) but I feel a little like my previous loyalty is wasted. And I want my free tortilla chips!",

    "text": "Tex-Mex greatness right here in Edinburgh, muy bueno!   In the States, Tex-Mex is one of the best, if not the best, form of \"fast food\"--both in quality and taste. Although, having said that, I should say quite clearly that Taco Bell does not qualify. Seriously, do not eat at Taco Bell or you will surely die. Hold on, now you're going to eat there like Adam and Eve ate the apple after being told they would \"surely die.\" Well, I am not God of Tex-Mex, but I do enjoy a good Burrito when I can.  For the value, this is a decent size meal for an averaged sized person (i.e., not a glutton) costing roughly 5, which is less than what you'd pay for the same quality burrito in the States and a good value for the amount of food in the UK.  These Burritos will give you the knowledge of good and evil Tex-Mex as soon as you eat them. Because Los Cardos makes Burritos as good as Satan can corrupt your life. Eat there... VAMOS!  By the way, Los Cardos = The Thistles... perhaps a reference to Scottish thistles? Another reason to eat there you prickly gringos!",

    "text": "When dealing with fast food, you have to consider the deliciousness/shame ratio.  That is, is the pleasure gained from the deliciousness of the food completely undone by the wave of diners remorse that follows as you wallow in grease-soaked regret?  A kebab, for example has a low score - as no amount of tastiness can overcome the bitter shame of that horrifying moment of post-kebab clarity.  The good news about Los Cardos is that it scores highly on deliciousness and pretty low on shame.  The food is excellent, and looks and tastes freshly made from good quality ingredients.  The staff are friendly and the service is good - the menu isn't particularly extensive but what they do they do very well, and it can be combined in enough ways to keep you occupied for a while.  Give it a go.  I think it's easily the best takeaway in Leith.",

    "text": "Never has love been so instant!  I take you back about a month, to the Yelp meet up involving a swarm of yelpers descending upon Los Cardos for burritos and beer. Unfortunately Mr. Adams had booked himself out that particular evening to meet a friend, so I decided to peruse the website and see what it was I would be missing....  Needless to say I was upset.  So upset that I couldn't wait for the inevitable 'next time' to swing round. I hopped in the car and swung by to sample this interestingly tasty-sounding menu that very night. Upon entry I was greeted by the friendly, chatty staff who were more than happy to talk me through the concept:  - Choose a wrap style (burrito, enchilada, quesadilla, etc) - Choose a meat - Choose a salsa - The End.  I opted for the Pork Quesadilla. Massive wrap bread, dealt with a generous portion of meat and even more cheese, grilled up and sliced into 3 sandwich-like servings. In a word: sold!  Subsequently I loved it so much, I managed to rope the friend I was meeting into going along again the same night the yelpers went down. Even beat most of them to it! It is now my mission to work my way round the menu starting with the quesadillas (pork, chicken and haggis down....). A New Year's intention I have no doubt I shall easily achieve!  Clearly taking a leaf from Oink's book, Los Cardos have taken the simplistic, does-what-it-says-on-the-tin concept and raised the bar a little higher.  The shop is low on frills, high on quality; a few seats for those that have made the distance to get their burrito; a delivery service is available and I think they might even be on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fjusteat.com&s=a683f1d4f1b5f44b3f6d67f384b8bb912b400799fed5ded1901f8bc7f3c2bc58\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">justeat.com</a>.   It seems it is these simple concepts that really reap success around Edinburgh. A fact that leaves me wondering why there aren't more eateries like this...?",

    "text": "Before I start, I must say that I'm Mexican and for the purpose of this review this does not mean anything else but: I'm proud of my food and I can be very strict with anything served as / associated with/ recognised as Mexican. Next, three facts:  1. Burritos can be found in their natural habitat only in the north of Mexico. And not all the north, but only some states. It's a very simple snack: a flour tortilla with a bit of beans and cheese (the most traditional one). You can also find burritos with other fillings (generally two, being one either beans or cheese). That's all, no rice, no cream, no guacamole, no salsa, etc...   2. Burritos are now a very popular fast-food snack in the US, possibly more popular in the south of the US where lots of Mexican immigrants live these days. Therefore, burritos are part of what is now known as tex-mex food. I've never tried a burrito in the US so I don't know how they are served but I presume this is where burritos took their now more popular looks and taste.  3. Los Cardos does not intend to serve real Mexican food or Mexican real burritos. They got the idea from the Californian tex-mex burrito and offer a healthier alternative to take-away food at a reasonable price, and using fresh ingredients and good quality products. This is what the website says (go and check if you want).  So now I think it will be fair to say that...  Los Cardos' \"interpretation\" and/or \"re-construction\" of burritos is a successful one and I think the success is the result of taking some common ingredients in Mexican food (beans, rice, salsa verde, coriander, cream, etc) with others not so common (like carnitas) and still leave room for the costumer's choice. Sounds like a winning formula, right? So basically, you choose the type of tortilla, the type of meat, the fillings, the salsas. How tasty your burrito will turn out to be, well... it's up to you.  While I was observing how my burrito was prepared (a carnitas burrito) with all the fillings I chose (cheese, cream, beans, rice, coriander, the whole lot really) the guy explained to me about the quality of products and freshness. And yes, very fresh and well prepared. So, what they say they offer is what you'll get. By the way, very friendly staff.  As a take-away you're not expecting the premises to be memorable. And as I was not planning to eat my burrito there, I didn't really pay attention to where costumers could eat. I do remember very vaguely to see a couple of tables with costumers.   I paid for my burrito a bit more than 5 pounds. A massive burrito. And I know it is a reasonable price for take-away food in the UK -and even more if good quality products are taken into account, but I still think it is rather pricy. Or perhaps I can't be objective enough (I can't help comparing prices of burritos in Mexico and they don't cost much at all... it's a snack!). Let's say that compared to other take-away snacks (kebabs, for instance), Los Cardos' burritos are probably within the price range.  So... Is this place good? I think it is. Is this good for Mexicans (especially the ones from the north)? Perhaps... it all depends how orthodox / flexible you are. Will I go back? If I'm in the area, quite possibly.   Being far from Mexico, not having \"my\" food here, has had many different interesting effects: I cook more, I've discovered markets and delis where I can find Mexican products (will write a review of Lupe Pintos soon!) but I have also learnt to appreciate other foods. To me, Los Cardos' burritos, as they say on their website, are purely inspiration. And as that, I take it... Yet, I was the most grateful Mexican when I first smelt the carnitas and a very subtle hint of orange transported me to a street market full of bright colours and music. Perhaps it was just an illusion or perhaps I was just... inspired.",

So we decided we would check this place out since the reviews were good. Easy little place to find . Small little shop right on Leith . Place was busy! Like crazy busy and we had just beat the rush . I will say this , people in Edinburgh love their Mexican food! Place is kind of like Chipotles , you get in line and go down the list of what you want in your burrito or whatever . I always go for the carnitas and it was the right choice! Good flavour and much better then the steak or chicken which my friends got. The steak was quite tough I thought and the chicken kind of bland. Prices were not to bad and you got a lot of food. Although I don't like when places fill you up with rice and beans in your burrito. Helps them save money by giving you filler. They were ok with it and didn't pile so much in which is good. Otherwise not a bad place 3-stars and I would go back again if I was in the area. If you are in the area check it out!",

The staff are nice too, so you can't go wrong. Don't waste money on \"Should Be\" Illegal Jacks (that expression copyright by Gillian L); for an authentic burrito get down to Los Cardos.  They have a couple of small tables, but it's basically a take away kind of place.

Also, as if it couldn't get any better, they had veggie Haggis that you can put in your veggie burrito. I was like..umm wha? And then we tried it and it was sooo good! Best veggie haggis ever! and in a burrito - total win-win.   I wish we lived closer to this place, then again, I might blow my whole bank account on it if we did! Definitely check it out ASAP!",

The first was just as it opened and I wasn't blown away then, but with the great reviews as of late I was looking forward to giving it another chance.  Unfortunately it was exactly as I remembered which was simply \"OK\".  I am a massive fan of Tex Mex food, burritos in particular, but the truth is I have had much better, not just in San Francisco where they originated from... but if im being honest, in Edinburgh.    The actual place it pretty cool, its primarily a take away but with a few tables if you want to sit it and the food is made in front of you, to exactly to your specification.  I was also very happy to find out that you could take the food next door to Victoria bar as well (which is what we did).  The staff were very friendly and served us all very quick.  I had a burrito, with chicken (Red Tractor Chicken to be exact, which was done is a chilicitrus marinade) which while sounds delicious, but was actually pretty dry and tasteless.  The steak and carnitas both looked more slightly more appealing so wish I had went for one of them.   I think getting the ratio of ingredients right is the key to a good burrio though and I think this was way too heavy on the rice, which was also unseasoned white rice that served simply to dilute any flavour that was there.  The saving grace here though was the Extra Spicy Salsa, which was absolutely stunning.  Had it not been for that, it probably would have been a 2* effort.  It filled a hole and was by no means bad, it was just way too bland for me to be rushing back any time soon.",

The pulled pork 'Carnitas' is probably the stand out choice but you owe it to yourself to try the haggis burrito at least once.   The guacamole actually resembles avocado and taste homemade rather than the ominous green gloop you find in some places. Salsa are also good and the Extra Spicy has a good kick.  It's a great option for delivery for those nights at home when you can't be bothered. Getting a generously sized bag of their tortilla chips should be compulsory.

Nothing worse then bad over priced Mexican. ... This place is like a connection to home (CA) for me! So excited! Will be back again for sure!",

The food certainly doesn't rival some of the great places that we have in California, but it was pretty solid fare for a country far, far from Mexico.",

It may not be the best burrito I have ever had, but it certainly is the best I have had in Edinbugh. Best Tex Mex you can find in Edinburgh. Does not lack seasoning or grill their burritos like paninis (unlike some \"mexican\" restaurants in Edinburgh). What would have nailed this burrito is a different cheese. Preferably Monterrey Jack. I love British cheese, but it was a touch too sharp for tex mex.",

It's a very tiny, very simple place which mainly consists of the kitchen and three small tables to sit down, if you're not going for take-away. Get a customer card, it's worth it!",

    "text": "My friend and I were having a lazy evening and craved spicy food. According to Yelp, Los Cardos seemed a safe option. I ordered a veggie burrito with pinto beans (not the one with veggie haggis-not my thing) and my friend got one with some kind of pork.   The estimated delivery time was about right (an hour) but the food arrived lukewarm.   The veggie burrito is kind of annoying. It's like the other burritos minus the meat, but at the same price tag... It was tasty enough, it filled a hole, but it had nothing on the spicy flavoursome Mexican food you can find in the states. There was too much rice, too little spice, and it just left me feeling not so satisfied, despite the humongous size. My Californian friend was likewise not so impressed. It could have also been better with a corn tortilla rather than the flour wrap.   Did we just order the wrong things?",

First, the good: the quesadillas are cheesy bombs of goodness. They're almost overly filling, and the chicken has decent flavor on its own. The sour cream and choice of salsa that come complementary are ample.  However, even cheesy madness has its limits. By the end, cutlery is almost a requisite to handle the impending tortilla collapse. And despite its spicy billing, the \"roastin' red salsa\" is without any burn, at least for anyone with a taste for Sriracha.",

This is one of my favourite take-outs to pre-fill before any booze related mission. Great customer service, friendly, attentive and hardworking staff. They serve: Massive super & superb burritos, all fillings freshly prepared from scratch, yummy flavours and a vast variety of combinations (burritos, quesadillas, soft tacos, with pinto beans, black beans, beef steak, chicken, pork & vegetarian, and your favourite salsa: Pico de Gallo, Verde, Black, Roasting Red, Extra Hot...you name it) Los Cardos also offered you a loyalty card to be stamped for every main meal, after 5 stamps you'll get Salsa & chips for free and after 10 ones you'll get a free meal...Needless to say that I'm going through my second or third card myself...Keep up the good work...Recommended 10/10.",

I have been searching somewhat fruitlessly for a Mexican place better than Pinto in Glasgow. I think I may have found it, however they don't put any salsa on the Quesadillas, which is a big part of the experience for me.   Apparently he had 'booked a table' but when we walked in, it didn't look like the kind of place where you had to book-there were only three tables.   I had chicken quesadillas with black bean salsa. Next time I'd go for a different salsa-because this was more like a hodge podge collection of corn and beans. We also got a side of tortilla chips with the verde salsa. It tasted okay, but I wouldn't choose it again.   I'm giving this a four because of the quesadilla on its own. The spices the chicken were cooked in were bloody great. It was just a great quesadilla. I'm not in Edinburgh very much anymore, but if I am, I'll be here again. However, I'll take away- it's a bit cold inside!",

Though if you get the burrito bowl, they are NOT required as the sour cream, meat/veggie choice, salsa, cheese, rice and black beans is all more than enough on it's on without added chips to dip into.  All of the above (with pork carnitas) was all nice and GF - happy but full tummy and I'll definitely return if I'm in the vicinity!  NOTE - the burrito bowl isn't messy but the wrap style dishes are so try to avoid spilling it everywhere as the fillings are generous!",

Now I am a bit bias as I am from Arizona, which is filled with amazing Mexican food...so I didn't expect it to be totally True to what I expected..however, I didn't expect to be disappointed. I ordered the vegetarian tacos and my boyfriend ordered a steak burrito. We live literally 2 minutes away and by the time we unwrapped them at home, my tacos were completely soggy from the juices in the salsa and beans. I also noticed when they heated the tortillas they didn't heat it for more then a few seconds, so they were also cold.  I would say the my biggest issue with my meal was that I couldn't get a hint of the delicious favors I would expect from Mexican food and the combination of the fillers were definitely too watery. Maybe it was just my one, that once, I am not sure.   They have the right idea, the food just wasn't good for me or my boyfriend.",

I headed here with a friend who had just come back from a 3 month internship in London, Los Cardos was apparently the first thing on her list for when she returned! On her recommendation I had the Carnitas, pork with a sweet marinade, in a quesadilla. I was given a choice of sauces and chose from the extensive salsa list. I went for sour cream and the mildest salsa as I'm not one for the heat.  The pork was delicious. It was soft and tender and the taste was amazing. I could eat that pork every day, especially covered in melted cheese YUM! The salsa was also great, it was fresh and tangy but not overly spicy. It would have been perfect except there was a big dollop of guac in the pot which I understand can happen but if I hadn't noticed I would be writing a very different review (Sara + Guac = big no!)   I have a loyalty card and I think this introduction was a little dangerous for me!",

All fillings were very tasty.  Couldn't fault on taste at all.  And i added extras such as gucamole and sour cream and cheese.  Value is 10/10  One word: MESSY. Because it's takeaway, by the time you start eating it, the tacos are soggy on the bottom from the sauces.  But it the taste was yummy-awesomeness.  Just Messy.  I like my gucamole, sour cream and cheese to be through out, not just on top.    I will be back - i will opt for the less messy burrito - probably the carnita as i love the taste!  I just hope that the have the sour cream through out the burrito and not just on top. (Illegal jacks do a terrific job at this).  Tasty, great value and yummy!",
