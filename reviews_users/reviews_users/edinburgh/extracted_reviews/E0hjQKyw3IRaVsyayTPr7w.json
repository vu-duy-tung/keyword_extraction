    "text": "Having arrived at a nearby hotel late in the evening stumbled across this Indian restaurant. Ordered a takeaway which was cooked up fresh in a few minutes.   Guys were very friendly and helpful, supplying me with some plastic cutlery and large bottle of diet Pepsi to go with my order.  Having got back to the hotel I was delighted to say this food was excellent. Really fresh and tasty.   Would highly recommend to anyone staying in the city in particular the Haymarket area. Restaurant looks very nice also, with a great selection of dishes.  Will return. Thanks guys.",

    "text": "Hot off a long, long day of travel and craving Indian food, my husband and I decided on the first place we saw coming out of Haymarket station. Walking in, we were greeted by an extremely friendly staff and full menu - exciting! Our food was delivered quickly and was absolutely delicious with the perfect amount of spice. My husband had the chicken madras, I had the chicken jalfrezi and we split a side of rice and garlic naan - the perfect amount for two individuals who hadn't eaten all day! As good as the food was, we were just as impressed with the service - and I will forever be grateful to our kind waiter who sprinted after us with my purse and scarf in hand. :) If we ever find ourselves in Edinburgh again, this will be on our revisit list for sure!",

The atmosphere is more upmarket than your usual curryhouse, the staff are very friendly, the food is fabulous (I particularly love the chilli naan and wish more places would make it).  I would recommend Ignite to everyone!",

Rice was a little too soggy but everything else was cooked perfectly. The staff were keen, they got our food out in less than 5 minutes from ordering.  They loose points because the toilets were in a bit of a state, shame really.",

    "text": "Service was NOT good. My friends and I were in reasonably good spirits after 2 pints each in the Haymarket Bar but we were not loud, raucous or ill-mannered in the slightest. There was only one other table populated in all the time we were there and the noise from their conversations was on a par with ourselves. Despite this, the waiter assigned to us barely managed to lift his facial expression above a contemptuous scowl. Not a friendly or inviting dining experience at all. Quite the opposite.   A large Cobra is 5. Main dishes were 12 & upwards. Not extortionate IF the food & service lives up to it. It doesn't quite deliver though and as a consequence, I wouldn't class it as value for money.   Having said that the food was tasty. It should be noted that all 5 of us found our mains to be VERY salty. A tactic to encourage consumption of their beer? Chilli heat was lacking too. There's only one chilli hero in my party of diners, so I'm confident this is a fairly balanced opinion on this.   I'd rather travel to Queensferry for an equally enjoyable meal with more hospitable surroundings and waiting staff at the Queen's Spice.   In summary, I wouldn't actively discourage anyone from booking but I won't hurry back either. .",
