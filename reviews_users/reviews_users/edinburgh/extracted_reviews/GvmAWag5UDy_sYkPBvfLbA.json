I haven't tried the fritters but you don't see them often in Edinburgh, so I'll have to go back soon for a fritter roll.   The friendly, funny people who run it are Italian Scottish, and have Italian news channels on the TV, which makes me feel like I'm somewhere more exotic than Mayfield Road. A plus!",

    "text": "Although there is not much in this fish bar which is actually from the 'Pacific' as its name suggests, it serves great food at surprising prices.  I first came here with my flatmates on the way to our friends' house party and we left impressed by the speed of the service and the general atmosphere of the place.  They have a really cool fish theme going on which is in keeping with its style of food.   Their fish and chips are excellent and we were glad to see that our haddock hadn't been sitting in the counter keeping warm for an hour before we arrived.  They were cooked to order in nice, crispy batter which went amazingly with their fluffy chips.  Along with a can of coke it came to about 4 which was actually very reasonable considering the quality and the size of the portion.  I would definitely recommend Pacific Fish Bar for a great, easy and cheap dinner.",
