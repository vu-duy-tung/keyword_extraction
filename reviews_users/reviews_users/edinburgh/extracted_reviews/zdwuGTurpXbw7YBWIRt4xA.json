    "text": "I've walked past here more than once every week ever since it was converted and opened in its current format. Each time I've caught a glimpse of the apparent confused look inside and opted to skip thinking it to be a place that just wouldn't be for me. I was wrong!   A night out with a friend exploring a few new places found us outside the Brig chatting to a bar member on her break. She managed to talk us inside and I'm glad she did! The original confused interial comment stands, but once seeing it in context it makes a little more sense.  Wooded table booths sit side by side with easy chairs, mixed furniture styles adorn each corner. This is in the main a cocktail it turns out, with lighting and music to match but unlike your west end crowded, noisy, unfriendly overpriced offerings this place feels more like the result of a splicing of an antiques shop, your local watering hole and a 2nd hand record shop's sound system, with a drop of confusion and bemusement thrown in for good measure.  If not gathered I really quite liked this place. Only thing I'd like to see would be the staff being a little more sure of their drinks listing (she might have been new but was quite confused when asking for a rum and coke specifying a particular rum from their list) and the beer taps not being used to serve wine on tap!",

    "text": "A lovely little bar. For Edinburgh it boats fairly cheap drinks and cocktails and even keeps prosecco on tap.   The interior is country and makes the place really homey. The staff are great and the food delicious. Originally I came here with a groupon which was a great deal (platters and cocktails for 4 for 22). But they have their own deals like 5 meals and drink discounts.  This place is a go.",

    "text": "I've been wandering past this bar loads on my way to and from work. It's one of Leith Walk's *new* bars. Someone has taken a classic (possibly read dodgy as fuck) 'spit and sawdust' (for the blood) bars and turned it into a trendy new thing.   Initially what drew me to Bar Brig is its big Heverlee sign! It's a delicious beer and I don't find a lot of bars serving it in Edinburgh, and it's not very far from my house which helps of a week day night!  I feel it's a confused little bar. They've a very well stocked bar, loads of interesting beers and gins and such, very much ticking the things that are in right now boxes, but the guy serving us (on a friday night) didn't really have much of a clue about anything.   They bar clearly has a found objects thing going on, all the furniture is made of driftwood or something similar, which normally I find pretty annoying because it's uncomfy, but they've adorned the place with throws and cushions which actually makes it really cosy. A big plus for me, but the bar is really weirdly lit. Huge BRIG sign that floods the bar with LED light, and generally I feel they would be suited both turning the brightness down on that sign, and just generally going for warmer lights in the bar.  I haven't tried the food yet, so there might be more to come from Bar Brig, but it's not massively charmed me...",

    "text": "We were staying in Leith and fancied trying out somewhere close by. However we were staying in the heart of seafood lovers triangle , which my other half is not a fan of , so we opted for Bar Brig. Lovely little bar which lots of reclaimed wood, cleverly used to create benches and booths. The bar had a lovely atmosphere and the bar man was quick to serve us, always a plus :) With such an extensive burger menu, we opted for a burger , with fries and slaw to share. The slaw was lovely and def enough to share. My veggie Morrocan burger was very tasty, with lots of flavour, could have been a wee bit warmer mind you. My husband opted for the blackened cajun chicken burger and was pleased it was a breast.  So you may be wondering why not 4 -5 stars? After a short while the seating became uncomfortable and I was not impressed with eating my burger out of an old orange box. I dont get this whole hipster style \"anything but a plate\" craze at the mo, it cluttered up the table and felt too much like take away, being served our meal in a box.",
