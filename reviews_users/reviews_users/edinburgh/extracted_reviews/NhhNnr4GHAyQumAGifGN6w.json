Love this spot.   Comfy couches and music playing in the background.   Clean bathroom and free WIfi!  What else can I ask for?",

I thought the people serving were fantastic and I felt the love when the coffee was being poured. There are bags of coffee showing the blends, but sadly they weren't available for purchase. I do love to buy coffee when I travel. The owner said she would like to do that soon, but it wasn't an option when I visited. One awesome feature is the floor. The mosaic-ish tiles are beautiful and really brightens the place up.   Strangely, when I think of the name I think, \"Smoov move ex-lax\", which is super not helpful, but here we are...",
