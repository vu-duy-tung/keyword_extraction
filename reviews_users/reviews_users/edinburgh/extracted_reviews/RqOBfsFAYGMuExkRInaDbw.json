    "text": "So it's Saturday night and I've arranged a dinner for 15 of my co-workers. Some of them arrive early at the restaurant and they don't appear to have my booking.  BUMS!!  It also happened to be the weekend the Six Nations was on so town was heaving. I was preparing myself for an onslaught from my hungry co-workers when I managed to get through to Chimichanga.  Situated just around the corner from my work in the West End it seemed the perfect solution. Mexican food and cocktails galore, just what I needed to keep my co-workers happy. I called up with my fingers-crossed....  \"Errrr... by any chance do you have room for 15 people now?\"  \"Yes we do\"  Thank the Lord! I quickly explain to my guys the slight change in plan and push them out the door towards Chimichangas. As promised the table was ready and waiting for us.   The cocktails are fabulous here, I shared a pitcher of frozen margarita. So good! The food is not just boring tex-mex either. They have your favourites of course including chimichangas and nachos etc but they lighter options too. I was torn between the seabass and the grilled chicken. I went for the grilled chicken and calamari to start.   My calamari was amazing! Lightly coated and super tasty. It came with an awesome chipotle mayonnaise too. My chicken was simply grilled and came topped with fresh guacamole and salsa. Delicious!   By this point the cocktails had worked their magic and my colleagues were more than satisfied! Phew!!  The prices are reasonable here with cocktails at around 7 and mains at around 10.   Definitely more to this place then just Tex-Mex!   Cheers, Amy",

The menu is what you would expect from a Mexican place: burritos, enchiladas, fajitas, and the other traditional dishes. They do have a Brazilian beer which was ok.   I haven't tried any desserts though .",

    "text": "Chimichanga is eminently forgettable. The wine was particularly poor and the food was fairly characterless. There are many better options available. The previous occupant, Bar Roma, was decidedly better.  Overall, we said: \"Chimichanga was a bit boring and safe. Both dishes were fairly underwhelming. While Bar Roma wasn't exactly setting the heather on fire, it was a restaurant very well-matched to its location, with good quick service, reasonable pricing, and it catered well for big parties. Chimichanga just feels generic and ordinary, so isn't a place that will be high on my list for a revisit.\"",

    "text": "The inside of this place is huge! There are some armchairs just by the door for those just having a drink or waiting for a table..  There are cute little booth/teepees you can sit in to have your dinner along one wall near the back.  We got our dinner to go so didn't much get to appreciate the atmosphere but the food was really tasty and the portions were huge. I liked that my burrito came with rice on the side rather than in the wrap. Means more meaty filling and less filling up my belly on rice!!  Think we will look to sit in next time as prices feel dear when the food is just wrapped in a foil bowl! Though not overly expensive for the amount of food you get.   Will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I'm always dubious about chains, especially when it comes to tex mex, but this was actually enjoyable. The food was fresh, very well prepared and presented and the service good. The burrito was filling, with the rice on the outside accompanied by some nice beans, salsa and guacamole. The BBQ burger was also very nice.  A nice fit out too, cool tunes and generally a good atmosphere. Will be back for sure.   The fact that we paid a grand total of 4.80 due to the PayPal promotion was the  icing on a highly enjoyable cake.",
