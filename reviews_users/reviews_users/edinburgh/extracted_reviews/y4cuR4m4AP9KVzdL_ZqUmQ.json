Lots of wood and ornate detail makes you feel like you're an extra in a film but it is a wee bit touristy, don't fret though I reckon this is only because of the location and during the festival. When Edinburgh's population doubles, it doesn't matter where you go because there's plastic ponchos everywhere anyway.  Even though it is still associated with Jenners, it's no where near as overpriced.",

The Abbotsford is one of the few existing pubs that challenged the traditional Beer Engine (the handle beer maidens pull to put the beer in your glass).   Scotland used a pre-bar delivery system. The engine is down in the cellar. Hence turning the tap rather than pulling a massive handle.   There are other bits about this pub that deserve a visit. An island bar. A ridiculously great position in the town. Top or bottom of the Rose Street Pub Crawl  (I would start here).   Go here and don't drink.   Go here like you would visit an Art Gallery   Not to see the past but to admire the beauty of something perfectly conceived and constructed. Like a fine portrait that perfectly shows you the combination of Scottish Engineering, Woodworking and Brewing combined into a wonderful place to be.  Study it - take it in - there is beauty here - along with history",

This is a traditional pub with the kind of decor you would expect from an old Edinburgh institution.  It has a good selection of real ales alongside the usual booze options, and they have bench seating arranged around the island bar. They do meals but I haven't eaten there. I usually pop in there for a quiet pint when I'm out and about in town.  I particularly like that they always seem to have beer from the Hadrian & Border Brewery, which is one of my favourites. I don't know if they have a regular relationship or whether it's a coincidence, but I hope they keep it up, as you don't see these beers in too many places.  Unfortunately I need to knock a star off due to their crimes against crisps. They stopped selling crisps and now only sell nuts! I could write an essay about the ruination of crisp options at pubs these days, selling you over-priced posh crisps when all you want is a pack of Walker's, but not selling crisps at all is just ridiculous. Get them told.",

The place is very homey there is a bar situated in the middle of the room and big long tables around the perimeter. The tables are designed for different parties to sit together. We ended up sitting next to a Scotch man who was with his grown daughters and nicece attending the Military Tattoo. We had a nice conversation.  The food was okay...nothing special typical pub food which is what I wanted. I had a chicken burger \"sandwich\" with fries. The sandwich was okay. A little bland and was coated with mozzarella cheese. The fries were above average. They were nice and big and very crispy.  All in all if you are looking for a good pub in Edinburgh, I would highly recommend The Abbotsford",

I love Rose Street because of the cool bars that sit along it; they are always just the right side of traditional mixed with cool for me. The Abbotsford is probably the nicest when it comes to decor, and I always love coming here for a pre shopping trip glass of vino.  The ceilings are ornate and the island bar is stunning in dark mahogany. They sell every sort of whiskey under the sun, but I'm more of an Amaretto girl myself. The Californian White Zinfandel is about 4 for a large glass which is a little on the pricey side but it is City Centre. Certainly not the most expensive I have had.  Lovely bar which is well worth the visit. Next time I will definitely be trying out the restaurant as I have heard great things about it!",

Once we left the bus station, we walked through St. Andrews Square and looked for some grub (did I say we were hungry).  Once we crossed the Square, we went to the Rose St., a pedestrian street.  We ended up stopping at one of the first restaurants we saw....the pub, Abbotsford.  The interior is everything one would think of whenever they conjour up their stereotypical \"pub\"---nice bar in the middle, dark wood paneling/fixturing throughout, and of course, beer.  It looked like we found a cool place.  Unfortunately, it we were proved wrong, and this is where we were introduced to some of the \"UK's legendary bad personal service\".  It was summer.  We were hot, and we asked for water.  This took 15-minutes (and this place was pretty dead).  Once we ordered, we waited 45-minutes for our food---during this time we saw two other groups order and receive their food in the meantime!  Once were clearly done with our food, we ended up waiting 30-min for a check...well, actually, I physically went up to the bar and asked for the check.  Am I missing something here?  I don't think so, because it seemed like everyone else was served \"normally\".    So, there beverages were average, and their food was average, but their service sucked butt.  I can't believe we wasted almost 2-hours here.  Oh, and we also asked them for directions to our hotel's address....and they totally sent us in the wrong direction!  Needless to say, a tip was not left.",

It's been great both times, but theirs was especially good, with refreshingly present spice (nutmeg and maybe mace, I'm guessing).

We loved the potato leek soup and bread, and were filled up on the tasty Mac n' cheese and beef pie. Also, get a cappuccino--yum!  Wait staff was attentive and kind; overall a lovely meal.",

    "text": "Had a rather disappointing meal here at this new town Edinburgh pub with traditional Scottish dishes with a more modern twist.  The location itself is very nice with the pub ground level and the restaurant itself on upstairs.  We were a group of four but we were told there were only two tables for two available not even next to each other but parallel.  I inquired why the two tables couldn't be just pushed together but they would've blocked another table.  So aggravating.  Plus the wait for a proper table would've been too long.  Needless to say, we couldn't enjoy our dinner together.  Ordered the venison haunch in au jus with mashed potatoes and roasted veggies.  First off, the portion of meat was tiny and I don't think we were served venison at all.  Venison has a distinct rich flavor and this cut which came cooked medium was more like a tender beef fillet.  Plus, a meat like venison often is served in a rich sauce to mask the gaminess, not au jus.  Regardless, the meat was tender and the sides okay but portions were too small.  Service though courteous and polite was slow and obviously unaccommodating.  Worst off was just as we finished eating, we were informed that a table for four just opened up and we can change tables is we'd like.  Wow!  Thanks!  We can settle the check as a group at least instead of dining together.  Prices aren't too high luckily.  All in all, a disappointment from start to finish and can not recommend this place unless just coming for a pint at the bar.",

We had dinner upstairs, and it was very quite and very relaxing. We had salmon, and fish and chips. The food and service were special, our waitress, was really a lot of fun. She mixed it up with us making us feel right at home. It's definitely one of the favorite local pubs. It was so good we went back for lunch the following day.",

Real Ales are served in The Abbotsford, and there is a large selection of whiskeys. There is outside  seating in the summer months. Well worth a visit to start off your assault on Rose Street!",

You could call it an old mans pub or I would rather call it a traditional bar. There is an OK selection of beers, Alchemy seems to be the brewery of choice which is always good.   Its Rose Street location gives it an eclectic mix of locals and tourists and so you can be greeted by old men pretending to be French when you try and get the only remaining seat in the bar to bewildered travellers trying to understand the said locals pretending to be French.",

We thought the place was empty because of the football match that every pub had on the screen but as the night wore on we realized that wasn't it.  I had the special which was a pork chop while my daughter had the fish n chips.  My meat was dry, tough and flavorless as was the sides on the plate.  The fish n chips were beyond the normal greasy.  For trying to be high end they missed the mark by far.",

Great for bigger parties or just sharing a table with a stranger and possibly making a friend. Some delicious cask ales on draught and a friendly, informed staff that will allow you to sample the ales so you can find one you like.

Situated in the pub central area of Edinburgh, Rose Street, The Abbotsford Bar is right in the centre of the city and is a convenient place to reach.  This pub is incredibly traditional and the inside is quite spectacular, it has super high ceilings with amazing art work on them and a vibrant bright pink carpet on the floor.    I come here quite a bit for pre-drinks on the way to a night out and I always have a fantastic time drinking here.  The Abbotsford Bar serves a wide range of beers, ales and wines and so there is something for everyone.  The prices are incredibly reasonable here too, with a large glass of the house red wine costing under five pounds - bargain!  Food is also served here, with standard traditional pub food dominating the menu such as steak, fish and chips, sandwiches and burgers, but there a few quirky additions to it as well such as mussels!    There is always a lively and friendly atmosphere in this pub and it is great place to either go for a cheeky wee drink or if you are fully going for it!",

I'm very shy and it can be very intimidating to arrive in a pub, during rush hour, on a Saturday. I rushed to the restaurant upstairs and asked for a table. The waiter looked around (there were at least 2 tables available) and said he didn't have anything at the moment. One of the tables had NO sign of reservation or anything. He sent me to the bar downstairs and not even gave me the option to wait for the next available table.",
