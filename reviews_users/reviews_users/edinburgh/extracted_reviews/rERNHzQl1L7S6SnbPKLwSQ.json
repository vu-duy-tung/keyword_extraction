    "text": "Martone's modest decor doesn't give away any secrets about how good the food is. Which is great because, like the other girls who have been here, I believe there's nothing worse than a trendy eating place. I hate ostentiatious, showy restaurants whose managers would prefer to cultivate an image, when they should be concentrating on the food!  So yes, the food in here is mervellous. Big plates of pasta served up in rich, tasty sauces and more traditionally Italian than some other chains in Edinburgh. They've got a decent selection of booze but it's also handy to come in here for a lip lickingly good coffee, especially since most of the coffee chains on Princes St shut at pitiful times in the early evening!  The staff in here are friendly and welcoming, the menu is substantial and good; the food in here is served up in plentiful portions. My mum always says that Italians really care that you get a good feed and although that's a stereotype, I must admit I felt looked after the few times I've been in Martone's. You can always tell a good restaurant by how attentive the staff are, and how they go out of their way to make sure that you enjoy your meal. It's a good indication that the food will be great, and it is in Martone's. A place to bring the family for a big birthday meal, but also a place to come for a wee glass of wine and some penne pasta.",

    "text": "Martone is a centrally located Italian restaurant/cafe. My boyfriend and I usually end up in here when we're waiting for a bus or train, as it's very handy for both Waverley station and St Andrew's Square.  The food is standard Italian fayre - pizzas, pastas and paninis. It's not a particularly adventurous menu, but they know how to do the classics well. The pizzas have lovely thin crisp bases and are very reasonably priced at around 7. Being Italian, they take their coffee seriously and you can be guaranteed a decent espresso here. The homemade ice cream is worth getting excited about, it comes in a variety of flavours (including prosecco and pannacotta) and is served in tall glasses with long spoons.   Service is quick and efficient, which is very important when you've got a train to catch. There's also a student discount. If you're looking for a quick bite to eat when you're in the middle of town, this is a great place to go.",

The prices are pretty affordable considering its downtown but the food was just ok.    Service was polite and prompt.  They gave us free tap water when we asked and came around several times to check on us.  The ambiance had a very busy feel that I feel suits a lunch place better.  I would come back for lunch, but probably go somewhere else for an italian dinner.   What I would come back for in the evening is the desserts!  The have a coffee bar with gelato and all manner of delicious baked goods.  My recommendation is go for an italian dinner somewhere else and hit up Martone's for dessert!",

Yet given that I only had 15 minutes left to get back to work and I desperately need an ice cream, I gave them a try. I made the right choice.  Admittedly I did find the atmosphere a bit too close to dentist's waiting room, but I'm not sure if that was down to the place or the two tables of diners eating in utter silence, but this all became insignificant as I scoffed down my ice cream. It was fantastic, exceptionally rich and creamy, and a huge step up from the dross you'll find standing in for ice cream in some of the city's more touristy dumps. Some of that cheap shite would go uneaten at a 3 year old's birthday party birthday party.  Given I'm mainly down this end of town only on my lunch break and it looks someplace just that bit too awkward to sit alone, god knows when I'll try the proper food, but I'll look forward to it.",

I love places like this because they always feel so much more authentic than big, showy restaurants and bistros. This place is nice, simple and serves delicious food for not a lot of pennies. It kind of reminds me of Dinos in Glasgow which is one of my favourite places to eat.  They do a cracking coffee which I had the pleasure of sampling. I had an amaretto layered liquer coffee which was absolutely gorgeous. The tables around me were all tucking into big bowls of olives, breads and hummus which looked yummy, and pizza which was very authentic Italian thin crust. We had eaten earlier but I was definitely tempted!  I noticed on the way out that they had glass fronted freezers with Italian ice creams, including a Gin and Tonic sorbet! Safe to say, I'll be back.",

    "text": "Oh my sweet goodness, I got served some happy today! After missing the express bus by seconds, I decided to wait for the next one with a quick snack. Martone was right across the street so in I went. The service is terrific, and the staff seem to enjoy themselves which really contributes to the relaxing atmosphere. I'm not exaggerating when I say I had the best damn chocolate cake I've had in a year: a generous slab of soft, fresh, nearly-black cake that was warmed just enough to make the icing ooze and pool onto the dinner plate. It was accompanied by a scoop of their famous ice cream, fresh berries, and an extra drizzle of chocolate sauce... because more chocolate, very yes. When you're sitting in a cafe on a Sunday afternoon, and they're playing hilarious AM radio hits from 1981 and the staff are chatting in Italian with customers and sharing handfuls of fresh mint, while you work your way through a slab of warm chocolate goo on your fork, you're as close to heaven as you can get.",

To our surprise we found that the restaurant is owned by Italians.  Pizzas were as good if not better than ones we had in Italy.  Proper cappuccinos and gelatos as well.  Highly recommend.",
