The cosy, comfy seats and sofas are perfect to sit back, drink tea or wine and knit the night away.  I haven't eaten here yet but the food I've seen looks amazing. Oh I tell a lie, I did eat some cashew nuts there last night and they were pretty tasty.  The staff that I have spoken to have been lovely, really friendly, chilled out and helpful.  The icing on the Hemma cake is the chilled out atmosphere. It is a lovely environment to relax in. I particularly like the decorative step ladder wrapped in fairy lights!",

    "text": "I have never been this far down this street before although have been to this end of town via the Canongate. Wow, I felt like I had been missing out when I first walked into Hemma. I immediately became attached to the place: helped by the relaxed vibe, cool music and cosiness. I kept looking around expecting to see an area with rugs, cushions and shisha but it's not that sort of place.   After a waitress got over her initial surprised reaction when I said I wanted to order food (I have no idea what happened there), another quickly appeared to take my order and I don't even think I had to wait 10 minutes for my butternut squash and blue cheese salad to be placed in front of me. It was massive and really good! I was actually quite surprised to see such healthy options on the menu after expecting typical grub of burgers, chips and the likes. My sweet tooth couldn't resist the home baking on offer so I had banana cake with a chocolate icing topping - really moist and flavoursome, yum! When it came to paying, I think I had been served by 3 different people throughout the night and was impressed that my bill was ready when I went to the bar and didn't have to figure out who had what - given the service at the start of the evening.   It was good of the staff to keep our table cleared throughout the night - they didn't seem bothered by the balls of wool everywhere and I barely noticed them when they were there as I was too absorbed in my knitting (not being rude). I really got into the music that was playing so asked the bar dude what was playing and he kindly wrote it down for me.  I'm looking forward to my next Yelp Stitch and Bitch night here. I like Hemma so much I want to knit it a hat!",

I think with the strong, oily smoked fish and the potatoes in creme fraiche, it would have been too much to have dressing on the leaves as well. And the egg... well, it was just what I expected, two lovely soft-boiled half pieces of egg! And green breans and ... man, I could eat it all again right now.   Hemma is bright and sunny and much more of a 'day' place that the other Swedish bars, I think -- it'd be interesting to see what it's like at night. They do a good bloody mary, too!",

The bar is a great size, so perfect for large group meetups and has a function room upstairs to. Although it is big and from the outside quite industrial, it is lovely and cozy inside due to its mismatched wooden furniture, snuggly sofas and fairy lights everywhere.   They have a great selection of cocktails too, although it would take a few visits to work your way through them all! Although I didn't have any food either time, it all looked and smelled delicious with a great selection, so I will be back to try soon. Staff were really friendly too and very helpful.  A great find.",

I was on my way  for coffee on Sunday afternoon, but just looking into Hemma  put me off, unfortunately....why?  The venue was almost empty, one bloke sitting in the window with a coffee and a paper and only  two other tables where occupied..that was it....it should have been packed on a family Sunday...  The furniture looked really out of place and there just wasn't enough of it...it looked like a cheap and badly presented '' shabby chique'' furniture sales room...  Their ''Scandinavian'' concept may have worked in the old Victorian pubs around Leith Walk,as they are small and their style and  little quirky touches seem to go down well with some people , here however  it simply does not work.I   I don't know why they have taken on  this venue ,( probably great  financial rewards should it get busy as it's massive I guess ), however in my opinion they may well have bitten off more than they can chew and are way out of their comfort- zone.........time will tell if this place will work, not for me I'm afraid, ....I do however wish them all the best and hope it will evolve..",

    "text": "Before we started coming here for our knitting group I actually had no idea this place existed. Last time I had a meeting in the Ton building this place was an empty venue. I'm so glad to see the space used again in such a unique way.   Hemma, like it's sister bars Sofi's, Boda and Joseph Pearce, has a bit of Swedish glam to the place. Cool european beats and a chilled out atmosphere make the place relaxing even when the music is actually kind of loud. For what is a heavily industrial space Hemma manage to make the room feel cosy and inviting. I think this may be the comfy chairs and abundance of fairy lights. You can never have too many fairy lights in my opinion.  I've never eaten proper food here, just tea and cake so far, but the menu looks appealing. I just wish the meze style platters were smaller. FYI I don't want to share my food...it's mine. The cakes are homemade and change daily but the chocolate banana cake has been my favourite so far.   These guys are good enough to let 12 Yelpers invade their bar with knitting needles and yarn once a month so I'm inclined to overlook some of the niggles. The inconsistent service mainly. The staff on the whole are lovely but sometimes you get the feeling they have more important things to be doing than taking your order. Everyone has off days though so I'm willing to overlook it. We're going to be going to Hemma a lot of the next year so I'll update my review later if they can bump up that to that extra star.",

    "text": "The food at Hemma has definitely earned that extra star!  Heading here for a yelp 'brunchy munchy' was a fantastic idea. I may have actually drooled when I saw the menu but I'm mad classy like, so I controlled myself.   After much deliberation, over an o.k. cup of tea, I decided on the Hemma Brunch, a slice of olive bloomer bread with lashings of butter, scrambled egg, mushrooms and tomatoes. I opted to throw in the extra pound and added trout (bacon was another option and in retrospect, both would have been epic.) When it arrived it was massive and looked absolutely delicious. It was definitely value for money as the taste was fantastic, I'm a butter fan, and it got me through to dinner no problem!   After I had a cappucino which was decent, it's not a 'fancy coffee' place but they did try on a few of the coffees to be a bit artistic!  Although my dish was so awesome I tried to recreate it for my breakfast this morning (with bacon this time) I did notice a slight problem with the service. Everyone was lovely so kind and friendly,  but perhaps we were too big a group for them to cope with at that time. One dish was forgotten (I admit being extremely guilty as Shona waited for hers!) though it was taken off the bill, at one stage a waitress returned to the table as she couldn't read the waiters handwriting and afterwards it seems Robyn got Kohleens drink! I understand that there is a laid back vibe to a place like Hemma, and that's not something you can create all that easily, but it shouldn't come at the price of smooth service.  I wasn't sure after my first visit if I would return to Hemma as it's a bit out of the way for me but after that amazing brunch I'll definitely be back!",

They have a decent selection of beer on tap, cocktails were of a good standard and the food is totally delish!! The Food. Seriously. Huuuuge yummy salads. I had roasted butternut squash, blue cheese, chorizo and pine nut salad. And is was maahoooosive and utterly tasty. BUT Hemma is just so lacking any of the character that is typical of the Boda Bars. It's not cosy or welcoming like Sofi's or Joseph Pearce!? It's quite air-y, contemporary and spacious but not in a way that makes me want to spend the whole night snuggled up in here. They do however have a few seats outside which is a bonus for the few sunny days we get.  So I would go here to eat and not hang about. It just missing that certain Je Ne Sais Quoi.",

    "text": "Finally something has gone into the building where The Tun used to be and what could be better than a Swedish themed bar who's sister bars include Boda, Victoria, Sofi's and Joseph Pearce?    This has to be a winner if their other bars are anything to go by.  This bar is huge with two floors so lots of space and seats dotted about the place.  They even have tables and chairs on fake grass outside so you can enjoy the Scottish summer days.    The staff are SO friendly and really attentive, regularly making sure that you're OK and enjoying yourself.  The owner seems to live there at the moment and is always doing the rounds, chatting to the clientele.    Instead of copying their competitors by offering pizzas, burgers, etc they have decided to branch out on another side of the market.  Their menus are full of sharing platters, salads, and freshly made sandwiches.  Between 5 - 8 the meals are quite a bargain.    A pleasant little spot away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre.",

    "text": "it's been many months since the rather disappointing salad i had at Hemma during a yelp brunch.  last night saw me wandering back through the doors though for the inaugural meeting of the yelp knitting group.  i admit i didn't have high expectations for hemma last night, but i was so impressed my immediate thought was to go home and update my review.  however, my new found skill for knitting had me completing two more rows on my scarf so the review had to wait til this morning.  hemma, you so got it right last night!  to start with your wait staff could not have been nicer or friendlier!!  i mean this was towards the end of the day for them, but they were sunny, bright, friendly, and helpful.  even though we mostly ordered tea and took up an entire corner with our knitting lesson.  they attentively served us but then left us to get on with the knitting only coming over to clear plates and cups aways as necessary.  and your food!  i got a smaller version of your greek mezze plater (which was kind of the kitchen to alter this for one person) and it was awesome!  it was also still huge with lots of tasty food, a wee bit too much for me to finish.  there was grilled courgettes and aubergines and a red pepper stuffed with tasty rice, and tzaziki sauce, and big slices of fresh bread, and olives over salad, and grilled haluomi cheese!  it was awesome and so good and i tried hard to eat all the delicious, but sadly there was just too much.  and lastly the vibe.  chilled out music, lots of people chatting over drinks, and just such a cosy feel.  we were there for three hours but time just flew by with such a lovely atmosphere that really helped make our knitting circle cosy and happy.  so i'm definitely a hemma fan again!  i may still avoid their salads, but everything else is definitely worthy of another star:)",

First of all I have to say the service was impeccable a warm welcome and prompt drinks service.  I love the decor its cool but relaxed and theres plenty of room which was a shock because if youve been to Victoria, Sofis or Boda they are quite small and a little cramped but dont let that put you off they are still fab! A brilliant menu my husband had the burger which was immense! I had the most amazing sweet potato, asparagus, feta and cant remember what else salad but it was lush and huge the bar guy that served us actually recommended putting chorizo into it which was dare i say it again IMMENSE! i think it was the best salad I have ever eaten amazing!  Drinks were prompt, food was prompt, service was more than helpful - the people I were with were a little fussy but everything was perfect when it came to the table.  Loads of room and a great place to take children and they even have table football! Im sold !",

The Tun doesn't do anything new or radical but for what it does do, it does it well.   Obviously set up to tap into the market of thirsty, bedraggled politicians and journalists at nearby Holyrood Parliament and The Scotsman Newspaper HQ, this place relies on it's consistantly high standard of service to keep a hold of said regulars.   Tall glass walls, comfy leather sofa's and a mix of modern and classic pop songs is what you can expect here.The usual bar food suspects prop themselves up alongside a menu of pasta dishes and salads, all carefully prepared in a small kitchen which prides itself on delivering decent grub and quickly.   The Tun also plays host to a large function bar on its Mezzanine level that can cater to parties of up to 250.   A rareity in many pubs these days but definitely worth mentioning is the fact this place has clean toliets! Just a small reminder that they have their priorities in the right places.   Nothing earth shattering but a great venue for a post-work drink and gossip.",

    "text": "What can I say? Hemma is where the heart is, and I think I left mine there!  I read through some of the other reviews here before we plumped for Hemma on the strength of its being so near to my current flat (and I've been meaning to head there for ages) and I was a little tentative since the response seems so mixed.  But all I can talk about personally is the experience that we ourselves had - and that experience was \"WOW!\" I came here for an impromptu lunch with my parents and all three of us got completely swept off our feet by the loveliness.  Their little manifesto on the front page of the drinks menu sums up the unique feel of this place; it's cheery, quirky, it's friendly and good-natured, and I love it.  The food is fab value at just under a tenner for a decent main, and especially for the giant portions we got. I ordered the spaghetti with garlic chicken (8.50) and the mountain of deliciousness that arrived was almost too much for me to finish, but equally, too good to leave. My parents were both equally thrilled with their meals - club sandwich for Dad, beef burger for Mum - and having nicked a couple of their seasoned fries, I can see why. I don't think I've ever encountered those fries' equal.  Despite the somewhat intimidating and angular exterior, the decor within is homely enough to easily justify the name \"Hemma\", being comfy and mismatched, and the windows (which we at first glance had thought were some kind of chic stained-glass mosaic) are actually creatively decorated with slides.  The thing I got most excited about was the awesome drinks menu; every single one of the impressive range of cocktails on offer is not only delicious-sounding but also wittily described, and for the meagre sum of 4, water-voles like me can order a custom mocktail instead. I can't wait to go back and try this one evening.  Yep, they've definitely taken my heart hostage, and I've got full-blown Stockholm syndrome.",

I first came here for drinks after hiking up Arthur's Seat with a few friends during the day on New Year's Eve. I loved the quirky, vintage-style furniture and the great selection of drinks at this cool Swedish-style bar. They have Blue Moon on tap which made me happy, and also are the only place in Edinburgh that I know of that has Boston-based Sam Adams on tap so it reminds me of home! I also loved that Hemma is surrounded with modern windows and the natural lighting flows in. Others had food and it looked delicious.   I have since been back a few other times. Once, on a Saturday night, I wasn't so thrilled with Hemma because it was really loud. On another weekday night it was much better, though, and really relaxed. I like coming to Hemma best during the day, though, particularly when it is warm and sunny so I can sit outside right by Holyrood Park!",

    "text": "I love a good Saturday or Sunday brunch so I was excited to check this spot out when Jenny L. organised a Yelp brunch event.  I checked out the menu online and it looked pretty good.  I was starving by the time I met everyone and quickly enjoy my americano.  I like how they put cucumbers in the water opposed to lemons or limes.  I think it's much more refreshing this way.    We were a pretty big group -12 or 13 people so I knew our order was going to take a while.  I opted for the 'Hemma Brunch' and added smoked trout.  As everyone received their meals I sat anxiously waiting. In my mind I kept hoping that they didn't forget my order but unfortunately they did! However, it was not the end of the world.  The server said it would be a few more minutes and said he would take my meal off the bill.  It was a sunny day and I was with great company so there could have been worse things! The server was correct, a few minutes later I was chowing down on my meal like everyone else.   My brunch consisted of a huge (half the size of a plate) slice of olive bread with creamy + buttery scrambled eggs, smoked trout, button mushrooms and cherry tomatoes. It was really big. I had doubts that I wouldn't be able to finish it but I persevered. (Note: When I doubt that I am going to finish something it must be huge - I can eat a lot!) It was great. I'm also not a huge tomato fan but I can say they were very sweet. The salads that various other people ordered at the table were ginormous and looked really healthy. I'd definitely want to try them out next time.   I think the location is great for a late lunch after climbing Arthur's Seat or I'd recommend this play to tourists after checking out Parliament or Holyrood Palace.  I'll be back to try other things on the menu (the ribs!!!)",

One of us got the salmon sandwich, which was humongous and gorgeous. Really tasty flavours. Overall for the price you get superb quality food and very good large portions.   Our friends were very surprised when the bill arrived as they had expected it would be at least double! So the prices are very good for what you get and the location is quite perfect if you are visiting the parliament or dynamic earth or the general vicinity.",

    "text": "Came here for the first time for Scran Salon as its not really local for me. Although Hemma means home in Swedish, it didn't give me that vibe, despite the floral chairs on the upstair mezzanine area.   It is all glass and open, hence not feeling cozy and although we were here for a private event, the noise downstairs travels up so it made hearing people speak a bit awkward.   So why 4 stars? I had sampled the food and it was great. This was provided as part of the event and was very scandi - salmon, trout, potato salad, veggies with dill, breads and more and it was lovely. Being gluten free, some options were off limits but the trout, meats and cheese were lovely. I only picked at a couple of things as I had eaten before I arrived but what I had was very good.   So Hemma isn't very local for me but I will be visiting again and if I have the munchies, I would be happy to eat here.",

It's the early afternoon cosiness or \"gezelligheid\" as us Dutchies would call it, where it really shines. All you'd need is a fireplace and you're good to go.  The atmosphere is lovely, being equally happy here with a good book or a group of friends, and you don't feel rushed. The food was the real surprise for me. I didn't think it'd be as good as it was, and it really was damn delicious. I had a salad in which the green beans were so crunchy they damned near jumped off the plate, and my girl-dates were happily munching away on their piri piri chicken and croque monsieur, both of which looked gorgeous.  I was surprised, I don't know why, I think because I've come to accept below-standard fare, but I really, really, enjoyed the food here. From now on, this is going to be a steady hang out for sure!",

Okay so the sign needs some work, but this new incarnation of the Tun's bar levels  is definitely worth a look. And I imagine my dukedom of Holyrood 9A might be in danger with Hemma opening no more than 40 yards from my work...!  Layout is identical to the old Tun, but the Swedish gurus behind this infamous chain have added their homely touches to the place. Rugs and teapots have been introduced alongside vintage sofas and fabric light shades. In honesty though, it's comfortable, but it's like putting an old antique wardrobe in the middle of Cargo Bar...! Doesn't quite look right in this modern building.  Prices are a bit steep for the out-of-the-way location (3.70 for a Jack and coke) but I do appreciate the free prosecco and canapes they provided for their official opening night. Boiled eggs with caviar and anchovies. Stinky yet tasty!  For me the decision to shun 9A now depends on the menu. Watch this space...",

    "text": "Originally part of the massive development near Holyrood anticipating the opening of the Scottish Parliament, the original occupants of this space struggled to get enough custom and eventually closed down. A great big glass edifice far from the main drag doesn't seem a likely spot for the latest offering from the Boda family of very Leith-based pubs, but Hemma (Swedish for 'home') really works it. And being a large modern space it manages to escape the biggest flaw its siblings suffer, being too small; this place is huge.  If you've been to any of the others - Boda, Sofi's Bar, Victoria and Joseph Pearce's - then you know what to expect. A hint of kitch, never enough to be intrusive, with almost too-cool staff serving better than average selection of tipples. Hemma also has a wide range of food on offer, a similar menu to that in Joseph Pearce's, with a Swedish twist on normal bar food.   The setting is cozy, a bland development with just enough personalisation to make it friendly. Being all glass there are often interesting views, whether it's the back of Arthurs Seat, Parliament staff heading for lunch or drunken Friday night visitors to the Pizza Express next door. The bar is on two levels; the upstairs, bookable for events or private parties, has provided me with many evenings of great entertainment.  The only problem for me that prevents it from becoming a regular haunt is that, despite being very close to many things, its location makes it feel out of the way and so I never think of going there spontaneously. When I do I'm always glad I did.",

It's perfect for a lunch stop before or after your climb to one of Edinburgh's most iconic landmarks.  They host a range of clubs from books to knitting so it's a perfect little place to chill for an hour or two.   I visited on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and ordered a veggie platter. The food was really tasty! So was the beer...! Stuffed peppers, bread, oils and humous, just what one needs before tackling the rest of the day sight seeing.  I can see myself returning again and again to Hemma as it's one of those places where you feel at home the minute you set foot inside.",

Hemma sticks to it's promise (Swedish for \"home\") and offers you a comfort-zone. Whether you want to come for coffee, a snack, lunch or dinner, or just chill out with a book - you are welcome.  The staff are witty, friendly and make you feel like you matter. The music is just the right volume to be heard but not interfering with your conversation. To me and my friends it has become our living room despite the fact that it is bait off-centre. We tend to spend hours there while the quiet cafe slowly turns into a vibrant restaurants towards the evening, studying or chatting while we are taking a culinary walk through their menu - and we are never disappointed.   They make the unofficial best carrot cake in town, by the way. Portions are very generous and you don't feel like you are paying too much for your food.  Ok, Hemma is not the most central spot but it is more than worth the walk down Holyrood Road!",

Maybe it's just the wrong name for the bar, but I don't feel homely and cosy here, with it's vast windows and cold finishes.  I've yet to warm to Hemma, like others have mentioned here, it doesn't have the same cute and snug feel as the others: Sofie's, Boda, Victoria and JP's.  Sure, there's the old country kitchen style table and chairs, but the open space feels cold and slightly souless.   Environment aside, the staff are super attentive.  They do brunch, lunch, buffet, smorgasbord platters, dinners and cakes, I've not tried the food, so can not comment. There's 12 draughts on tap and a fine cocktail list.  They have lots of events eg networking meetings, promotional events, Vintage pop up shops, of course there's the Yelp knitting night and even a Commando training group called \"Do it Commando\"! The mezzanine level takes up to 130 people and so could be a great place for party.",

As other reviewers have said - it's a bit airy space and, despite the horrific weather that day, felt quite cozy.    Staff were lovely - chatty and attentive- the coffees we had were good and cocktails were *incredibly* good.    The food is what let it down for me.  I had a chicken and bacon club which had huge chunks of chicken that was so over cooked it was hard to bite through, and bacon that was so fatty I needed to deconstruct the sandwich to pull out most of the fat/bacon.  The herby fries were brilliant, though.  Some of my friends ordered salads which were huge, but from what I saw looked mostly like *lots* of lettuce and not a lot else.  The flip side is that the food is really reasonably priced.  I also liked how family friendly it is here - I believe they had a microwave in the corner for mums to be able to heat up food for their kids.  I think that's great because kids can be picky and I'm sure it's much easier to just be able to bring your own food than hope the restaurant can prepare something they'll like.    So I would definitely come back and drink more mojitos and eat more herby fries, but would view the rest of the menu with caution.",

I visited here a long while ago with a friend on a nice sunny day when it was pretty quiet and had the most amazing scrambled eggs (not hard to go wrong there, but really good ones are rare!) and enjoyed it, though there wasn't all that much of any kind of ambiance so it didn't hit  me with any memorable ''I must come back here'' response. Anyway.  I visited here again due to proximity a week or so back with my boss after we'd been to a meeting nearby.   The overall verdict is that the food is pretty nice (I opted for a salad this time round, it was delicious!) but the company is what's gonna make your visit to Hemma cause the ambiance is still fairly M.I.A. It's like a very nice clean white canvas to paint your own stuff on really. I basically ate my salad in silence other than speaking to the waitress (who was lovely by the way)  given that my boss is not the greatest conversationalist and that there was nothing else really going on. And sadly there was no cocktail for me this time, but I can report with confidence that the coffee is a spiffing good cup of java!   Not at all bad, but lacking that little bit of sum'in to make it great as yet!",

The first two times I came I was unable to get food at all - they were just mysteriously \"not seating people now\" even though they had obvious empty tables and it was no where near closing time. The third time I had to argue with the staff to sell me a slice of cake, as they claimed \"the kitchen was closed\" even though I just wanted cake and it was on their counter. Eventually they gave it to me, but again, confusing.   I went this week for the fourth time and was actually served, which was a nice change. It's a beautiful place to sit and work, with lots of nooks, couches, plants and windows. They have foosball. They play good music. The food is good. The concept is \"Swedish Living Room\" which is cute.   I tried the big Green Salad with added steak. Very tasty, fresh, good dressing. The steak (+4) was a very small portion. I also had their sweet potato fries with spiced aoili - yum! Really really good. And the warm chocolate cake... incredible! Like a brownie but superior. It was still a bit slow, and a bit overpriced, but I had a nice time at least. For all my earlier disappointing experiences this time was better.

We actually at their twice, once for late lunch and the other for brunch. And both times we had an amazing experience. Their sandwiches were to die for, obviously all freshly made with quality ingredients. I would definitely return here to just grab a coffee and hangout, or to get another full meal. Good place for university students and others alike!!",

My friend and I came here for breakfast on a Sunday at 10am and there were lots of free tables. Staff was incredibly friendly and coffee was delicious both americano and lattes. Since Hemma has a hipster vibe to it I decided to try the trendy avocado pea toast with a poached egg (very good - what you would excpect) while my partner ordered the Eggs Brando. Do yourself a favor and order the Eggs Brando - incredible scrambled eggs with feta, honey and some other magic.  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.com%2FShowUserReviews-g186525-d3206084-r530969166-Hemma-Edinburgh_Scotland.html&s=9af65b6ea661f171a2f347937f1a646b9626f490fb5cbb1750d1f3edd88d42df\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tripadvisor.com/ShowUser...</a>",

    "text": "Bit of a belated review this one, given its well over a week ago I was here - but busy wee boy & all that...  Actually been here a few times, but this was my first dining experience, so figured it warranted a follow up. It's owned by the same guys who run Joseph Pearce, Victoria & Boda - so has the same choice of nice beers & cocktails, and the Swedish-themed menu. Only big difference with this one is visually - in a big open space in the new bit near Holyrood, it's all high glass windows and scuffed boho furniture.  This being the weekend all our lovely students returned to the capital, it was slightly over-run by, making me feel a tad on the \"haggard old man\" side in comparison. It is quite close to a fair few halls of residence, so I'd avoid if you have a similar aversion to our young learners!  Onto the food though - this may show me up as a bit of a foodie numptie, but I was introduced here to something I never realised existed - the Croque Madam!! Essentially a Croque Monsieur with a huge fried egg whalloped on top!! It's made on nice, thick crusty bread - so a big improvements from the soggy slices you usually get lumbered with. Lots of nice cheese and a chunky, thick slice of Canadian ham (not usually a favourite of mine, but worked well here). Stick on their amazing Hasselbaink (typo I realise, but I have a Jimmy Floyd blind spot...) potatoes & you're onto a big winner!",

    "text": "Last Sunday I visited Hemma with a friend. We wanted to play a few board games and Hemma had big enough tables to accommodate us.  While waiting for him, I sat outside and I enjoyed the sun, a coffee and the free Wifi. Bliss.   I always find Hemma buzzing and especially when the weather is sunny it creates a very pleasant atmosphere in and around the bar. Being surrounded by all glass Windows you may think this will get very warm inside, but it was nice and cool.   We set up our games and ordered some lunch. I have to say that I am massively impressed with the food on offer (brunch, lunch & dinner) and the size you get for the price you pay. The Croque Monsiour with egg was big enough for two, though my friend did manage to eat it all by himself :o) I like the skinny crispy fries they serve, those are my favourite (In Scotland you usually get the chunky chips) and are difficult to get outside of a certain burger chain.  They have a very friendly and efficient table and counter service, which encourages people to order a little more 'since you asked so nice'.   I enjoy coming here as you have happy people from all around Edinburgh and they allow dogs too!",

The smoked salmon and dill potato salad was awesome (as were the swedish meatballs, of course). They make a very nice coffee and have really reasonably priced cocktails and a great selection of beers.   Really laid-back space, multiple levels of seating, with big windows and tons of natural light, great for working during the day or getting a drink at night. It has the vibe of a community space more than a cafe. And it's pet-friendly!   The staff were incredibly friendly. Highly recommend you stop in for a bite if you're in Edinburgh!",

I came here for a catch up with pals and enjoyed the table service, huge cups of tea and hodge-podge decor.   I had a veggie burger. It was enormous, came with a huge pile of seasoned french fries, pickles on the bun (YUM) and home made coleslaw. Delicious. Also note that the burger patty was home made, none of this frozen breaded nonsense. It was so tasty.   The only downside? Bit drafty with the door opening and closing all night. But if you place yourself strategically on a table out of the way of the door you're likely to be cosy and warm for the duration.",

I'm glad I did. It was a delish way to pack in some of my five-a-day & the fresh dill through it gave it an interesting Scandi twist.  The portions are very generous & there was a side of lovely fresh bread & butter.  The upstairs has a cosier feel than the downstairs.
