I understand from other reviewers that it's mainly a delivery service, but they certainly seemed to be doing well catering for the lunchtime market, judging by the available selection of delicious sushi boxes on the chiller shelves. It's hard to choose what to get as it all looks so delicious!  They have a good selection of veggie sushi too, which is always nice to see.  The prices are perhaps a little on the expensive side; I spent just over 10 on two sushi boxes and a drink, which was a little over my usual lunch budget. But I didn't regret it as the sushi was excellent and certainly kept me going throughout a busy Festival afternoon.",

    "text": "First, let's talk about expectations. This is not a five star sushi restaurant with perfectly balanced flavors and big hunks of the freshest daily catch. It's not even really a restaurant. What it is is a quick stop one block from my house that lets me order online, pick it up on the way home, and enjoy a decent sushi dinner for cheap.   Soul sushi manages to provide grab-and-go sushi that's still trustworthy and fresh, with some other add-ons available. I'm a big gyoza fan and particularly like the pork ones here. I'd recommend those over the soups, which in my experience have been a bit bland. Honestly, when was the last time you thought \"I wish this miso soup was saltier\"? For the sushi itself there is always an element of personal preference. On my last visit I had the tuna/avocado roll (light, simple, and classic) and the spicy salmon (usually a favorite, but I didn't care for the overpowering chili sauce).   If you're looking for a fancy sushi dinner, or even a casual one, I'd recommend checking out one of the other fine places in town (Soul Sushi does have a few tables, but the low stools aren't very comfortable and the ambiance is clearly for take away). If you're looking for a quick meal that isn't fried chicken or a way to have sushi as a more regular meal on your table, though, check out this little spot.",

The butternut pumpkin sushi was mind blowing and I could gladly eat that daily. Katsu chicken maki rolls were in no way small as I had expected, and the creative adding of red pepper was a nice touch. Salmon nigiri was fresh, and surprisingly my only issue was the spicy mayonnaise in the deluxe California rolls was a bit bland, needs more spicy!   I'm also generally a fan of seaweed salad to pick at, but this portion was a hefty size I happily gobbled up. It's also real seaweed (I have no idea what I've been picking at this while time!)  Hefty servings of wasabi, soy sauce and ginger too.   Delivery was fairly quick (about 45 minutes across town) and service was friendly.   The price, for 30 total filled two adults with leftovers (for about 5 minutes, it was too good not to eat!. Totally reasonable for Edinburgh and I'll gladly be a customer again and again.",

The rice is not made with much carefulness and sticks to your hand or chopsticks upon touch.  The salmon was very average, and what's the point of having a katsu chicken roll if it's sitting around in a refrigerated section? Isn't the point of katsu chicken that it be warm and crispy?  This business does not make sense to me, especially at current prices.  If you absolutely must go, go for happy hour, but get their early for happy hour because people will take all the good stuff.  I would recommend that Soul Sushi have a rule that people can only buy 2 items per person for happy hour.  Also, whoever you are that reported my original Yelp review... I was just being honest, and I hope that this more detailed review doesn't get reported again. And I certainly hope that it wasn't someone from Soul Sushi who reported my initial review.",

    "text": "Soul Sushi is path To make that tummy happy Prepare to stuff face!  I know, I know. The real shame isn't my terrible haiku, it's the fact that I haven't reviewed this fantastic joint yet. Each time I've had the pleasure of partaking in some Soul Sushi action I've left with the fullest of tummies (sometimes belt-looseningly so) and happy noises.   The first time I was presented with an epic family platter of vegetarian sushi was on the Fourth of July, which to my American self seems fitting somehow. The platter itself at 36 pounds is an amazing deal for sharing with friends, or for just totally forgetting your inhibitions and sharing with your equally-sushi-loving husband. 13 pounds per person with that much sushi is SO GOOD compared to what you would get in dining out somewhere. Add a few more sharers into the madness, and the deal is even sweeter. Trust me when I say that's a lot of sushi--for two people you will feel like you have a sushi baby in the oven. But fortunately for you, as Soul Sushi is delivery and take-out only, you can relax in sushi-induced stupor in the comfort of your own home. No judgement from fellow diners at your sushi vacuuming abilities here!  So, good value aside, let's talk about the sushi. It is DELICIOUS. You'll be hard-pressed to find sushi so well-presented and also tasty anywhere else in town--and not only that, but they have numerous veggie options. Veg-heads: rejoice! I really don't think I need to say anymore here.  Soul Sushi is, in the end, a delightful find. This is the kind of place that you're pleased to share with your friends, like you're imparting them with a special gift or an excellent secret. And indeed it was passed on to me by the lovely Amy B., and so has gone forth and spread into the land of Edinburgh through the Yelpiverse. In all honesty, my only beef with Soul Sushi is that they don't have a branch on the West End side of town. Maybe with enough begging and pleading and bribery they'd be willing to deliver to the hubs and I all the way across the city, but until then, perhaps it's best that I don't empty my wallet binging on sushi every day.  Keep on sushi-ing on, Soul Sushi! And I'll be first in line when you take over the world, or at least, open up a branch in the West End.",

They do huge 46 piece garden platters for 26 which easily feed three and could probably happily feed four if ordered with side dishes.   As someone who's allergic to fish they have loads of vegetarian options and they are all super tasty. I especially love the butternut squash rolls and teriyaki tofu. The fish sushi is also quite tasty according to those who could eat it.  For event catering the platters are good value and look really impressive but they also work for sitting on the living room floor while drinking wine and avoiding packing boxes.   Seriously Soul Sushi expand the delivery area to my side of the city or I'll just have to keep getting my friend who lives round the corner from you to carry a ridiculous amount of sushi across town on the bus.",

    "text": "This is an easy five-stars for me.   As I've mentioned before on Yelp, I'm that insufferable asshole that says things like \"you just can't get good okonomiyaki outside of Hiroshima\" or \"this bibimbap isn't quite comparable to what I had in Busan\". In a similar sense, I've really had a hard time enjoying sushi in the UK since I spent a couple of months in Japan. I still like it, but it's rarely the same thing.  When one of my friends who I first went to Japan with recommended Soul Sushi, I took the recommendation seriously! I was not disappointed.  I perused the menu on their website carefully. They've got all the usual varieties of sushi that you'd expect from any serious sushi restaurant, which you can order servings of individually, but it's their 'boxes' and platters that make their offerings really interesting.   The boxes offer themed selections of 10-12 pieces of three different types of sushi for between 6 and 9 per box, which is pretty decent value. The platters are great big boxes of between 46 and 68(!) pieces of sushi of many different types.  I got the 'Garden Platter' to share with her indoors, which is 46 pieces of veggie sushi for 26, which is a bloody steal considering how good the sushi is. The two of us were totally stuffed, so I'm not sure if the platters are meant for just two people to share. If your appetites are big then one platter between two will hit the spot, but you could probably easily share it 3-ways and still find it filling.  The sushi is absolutely fantastic. The rice is perfect, the ingredients are super-fresh and well treated and the presentation is as neat as a Japanese salary-man's underwear drawer. I have not tasted better sushi outside of Japan.  There's no restaurant to eat in, but if you want sushi delivered to your door in Edinburgh, Soul Sushi should absolutely be your first port of call.",

    "text": "You know, 4 stars feels a bit mean, as I really enjoyed our sushi last night, but I think I'm going to wait a little longer before giving Soul Sushi 5, mostly to check that they're brilliant every time.  Soul Sushi is a delivery service, and whilst I'd heard of them before through the Twittersphere etc, I hadn't had the chance to try it myself.  Recently, however, they joined Just Eat which really meant I had no excuses not to give them a go.  Last night we finally placed an order, and it was just what the doctor ordered.  There's a variety of maki, hosomaki, sashimi, inside out rolls and nigri to choose from, as well as miso soup, edamame and a couple of salads.  The most economical way to order is to order a couple of boxes (which have 3 different types of sushi) or even better a platter.  We swithered over the set meal for two (good value at 24), but in the end went for 3 boxes - the Loch Duart Salmon box (salmon and avocado maki, salmon hosomaki and salmon nigri), the Field box (beef tataki inside out roll, chicken katsu inside out roll and asparagus nigri) and the Allotment box (butternut squash and sweet chilli inside out roll, mixed vegetable maki and more asparagus nigri).  The boxes range between 5.75 and 9, and you get 10-12 pieces in each, so it's both filling and reasonably priced.  Oh my, it was all good and very tasty.  The stand out dish was easily the butternut squash and sweet chilli, but honestly I enjoyed every bit of it.  A little pot each of soy sauce, pickled ginger and wasabi was delivered too, and wow was that wasabi hot! I love wasabi, and this was blasting my sinuses like never before. Amazing.  I'm not a sushi expert, so I can't tell you how this compares with sushi joints all over the world, but let me tell you it was damn tasty and much, much better than your YO or supermarket stuff.  Plus, it was excellent value for money (for sushi, that is).  We will definitely be ordering from Soul Sushi again!",

We go for the land and sea platter most of the time. This is a 36 piece platter featuring a variety of fish and vegetable rolls and nigiri. The platters change daily to what is fresh and what the chef wants to prepare. The food arrives beautifully presented and is always freshly made.   Last night the four of us shared 2 platters and a tuna box, all for 16 each. It would be at least double that in a restaurant.

After going through their menu I found it difficult to find anything that didn't have avocado in it. I'm somewhat allergic (no epipens but I don't fancy a rash all weekend).   I picked out my options and scheduled the delivery. Seeing that the ingredients were given I assumed that I had chosen things which did not avocado in them. When the sushi arrived I was giddy with excitement and absolutely starving. Three packs of chopsticks were included...make of that what you will....so I think the delivery guy was surprised to see just little old me.  When I opened it up everything looked delicious. The miso soup was lovely and had lots of tofu, nom! The seaweed salad had a little bit of spice but not too much, making it absolutely perfect. The maki and sashimi were divine! Then I moved on to the uramaki and to my dismay most of them contained avocado. Which means I'm left with a few whole boxes until I can find someone else to eat it!  I take full responsibility for not mentioning my allergy when I ordered but given that so many of the ingredients were outlined in the menu I thought I'd managed to get around it.   So for now, despite the deliciousness, I can't give a full 5 stars.",

    "text": "To celebrate 2 years together, I decided to treat the missus to a cosy night in with Tony Bennett on the speakers, and a youtube video of a fish tank on the tv. All that was missing was some excellent sushi, and luckily Soul Sushi didn't disappoint. Good friendly customer service, efficient delivery and a friendly delivery man. And the Sushi was very tasty and fresh. The rolls are a generous size and well presented in nice decorative trays. It's up there with the best sushi we've had. There were no chopsticks included, but who am I kidding.. I would have ended up munching them with my hands or a fork either way! I've not yet attained a Mr Miyagi level of skill with them.",

    "text": "I only discovered Soul Sushi one week ago and I have already been three times. Enough said, except to say It's fantastic! Woo!   We ordered the Land and Sea platter between the two of us, I suspect its more suitable for three people but we both have big appetites, especially for sushi. It's excellent value for money and a good way to try out the various combinations on offer. I particularly enjoyed the herbridean salmon avocado maki and the breaded king prawn roll as did my eating partner. The salmon avocado maki are MASSIVE in comparison to the ones I've had in various restaurants, with large chunks of salmon.  To my delight, Soul Sushi is very close to my flat, therefore both times I've gone for collection. Each time they apologised and informed me there would be a wait (due to high demand evidently, and the fact I was ordering in the evening over the weekend) but even then the wait was minimal! Only 30-40 mins, so when they're not busy they must be mad swift.  The only slight disappointment I had even before I ate there was that they didn't have soft shell crab roll on the menu. They have so many other tasty options though it wasn't missed. However, if they did eventually add this to the menu I would be ecstatic. Just saying...  So, this Friday coming I know what I'll be eating! See you soon SOUL SUSHI!! :)",
