    "text": "Despite working nearly opposite Pep & Fodder for the first 4 months of its existence, I had never noticed it before. Oops! And since moving jobs I've not been up Waterloo Place way for a while, or at least not in search of food. But, this Saturday, after a stroll up Calton Hill and in desire of some lunch and a cup of tea my boyfriend and I strolled past and thought \"Yep, that place looks nice\", and it was.  The decor's lovely, the lime green tiles particularly, and they were playing a Beatles best-of (FAB). The chap who seemed to be in charge was very friendly, to everyone and not just us, which really makes you feel appreciated as a customer (I was asked twice how my soup was).  I had a breakfast tea and their soup of the day, carrot and corriander which was served in a mug with a slice of bread. I've been trying to cut down on starchy carbs but couldn't resist the bread, mmm. My boyfriend ordered a mocha which was served in a little glass cup. Sweet.  Price wise it came to less than 7, which wasn't too bad.  I'd agree with previous reviews that comment on the selection available (or lack thereof), only one soup, and teas listed as \"Breakfast\" and \"Herbals\" (I assume if you enquire further they have several, as I spotted an Eteaket sign, but it's not obvious). Oh, and whilst the breakfast menu looks decent it was strangely lacking in eggs.  But, it's a nice cafe, and perfectly located for a quick pick-me-up after visiting Calton Hill and if I'm in the area again I'll pop by for a brew.",

I popped in for a quick lunch one day, and had a delicious soup with a big chunk of bread. There is of course an excellent selection of sandwiches and cakes as well, and all with friendly, helpful staff.  Unfortunately, the small size means seating is limited, and we had to sit outside on a chilly afternoon. However, I'm sure this is an excellent takeaway option if you live/work nearby. :)",

Nice unusual choice of sandwich fillings, but good combinations, the staff are kind enough to make changes if you want to swap out a filling or even try to make your sandwich. Would definitely pop by again!",

It was busy during the lunch time rush but the queue and efficient staff moved things along quickly. I ordered a cheese and tomato toasted croissant which was delightful and toasted well enough for the cheese to melt (a must for me)....happy days! It was deliciously buttery and the sweet and savoury kick went well with my flat white coffee. A great location and find in the city centre with a good selection of lunch time sandwiches and decent coffee served with a smile. Definitely worth a stop after my gym session today but hopefully not undoing my workout completely... I'm into balance!",

It certainly merits a return visit, once they've had a chance to bed-in a little more, and once they have their soup on the go. It has a nice array of cakes and pastries, too, so it may well be worthy of a visit from our Cake Questing friends soon, too.

The \"high street\" on both new and old town literally has the same handful of stores every other block or so (I'm not joking - imagine seeing an Apple store on the left side of this block, and then on the next block there's a second store on the right). Long story short, it's expensive and a tourist trap.   We were REALLY happy to have found this little shop because it was not only really affordable, it wasn't a trap and it was high-quality food. And when you see a steady stream of work-a-day Scots wandering in for their daily coffee or breakfast, you'll be even happier with your choice.   For lunch we both got a panini and soup - the tomato chutney, pesto, olive, mozzerella and salami panini, and the lentil soup. The sandwich was pretty huge and delicious (real mozz), and the soup was a huge bowl of lovely homemade lentil. Each meal was the equivalent of $8.50 and well worth it. HIGHLY recommend if you need a break from the tourist vacuum.",

We had their bagels toasted with a side of salad and it was just perfect for a warm mid morning spent inside.",

    "text": "Wanted to catch my friend before he left the city to head to the Glasgow so we went to this place for tea and cake.  The cafe is pretty close to Waverley station but away from the crazy foot traffic in the area. It's a cute cafe that offers the typical coffee drinks and an assortment of sweets and scones. I really wanted cake and luckily they had a carrot cake but gluten free. I was a bit hesitant to try it but the girl said it was really good so I got a slice.   Let me tell you...the carrot cake was AMAZING! It was moist and the icing went perfectly well, not too sweet like most icing. My friend who was also skeptical about eating the cake tried it and surprisingly liked it as well. Truthfully, I'd come back to this place just for the cake! Ha!   My friend got the million pound shortbread square...(or whatever it's called) you know the ones with three layers- chocolate, caramel, and short bread. It was decent, nothing amazing about it.   The staff were pretty nice and the facility is clean. It's a good spot just to chill from the hustle and bustle of that part of city centre... If anything just go to try their carrot cake! Mmmmm",

    "text": "From the second we walked in I instantly fell in love with the decor and cosiness of this cafe and loved the diagrams of what makes each different type of coffee above their menu board.  I originally ordered the porridge with compote but they were out and so had to settle for porridge with honey (~2.50) instead. It was not a tough decision as the cold weather outside called for a warm and filling breakfast dish. To go with my porridge I ordered a tea (~1.80) and choose the 'Scottish Breakfast' option from their tea selection. It tasted similar to many other teas I have tried and I cannot say that any flavour stood out to me. I ended up needing some help to finish the porridge as it was quite a dense and filling portion, however it was very delicious and S my travel companion for my Scottish road trip enjoyed it also. S for his breakfast had a latte (~2.55) and pain au chocolate (~1.50) to go with it, he liked both and had no complaints about either.  The staff at the counter were friendly and easy to chat with, even with the constant stream of customers coming into the cafe. The cafe was pretty much filled the entire time we were there along with a stream of people doing take away orders showing that it is a popular cafe in the area. Overall I enjoyed my meal and would happily recommend it to anyone in Edinburgh and looking for a friendly, delicious and very reasonably priced meal for breakfast.",
