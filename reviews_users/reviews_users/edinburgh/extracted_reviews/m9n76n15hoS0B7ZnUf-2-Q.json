    "text": "The Scottish Breakfast is amazing, but you've to be in before 11.28am to get one! My party and I arrived at the restaurant to get some breakfast on our last day in Edinburgh. We'd been here on our first day and tried the breakfast and it was amazing! Everything was cooked to perfection and the coffee was pretty decent as well.  On our last day, much to my disappointment, I was informed by our misanthropic waitress that the kitchen didn't serve their delicious Scottish breakfast after 11.30am. Understandably I tried to see if there was any possibility that an exception could be sought on my behalf since it was exactly 11.30am and the restaurant wasn't terribly busy. I was told, without even pause to look at the kitchen, let alone consult with them, that it was IMPOSSIBLE and that the kitchen \"didn't like to cook the breakfast after half eleven\".  Other than that, the service was passable. Our waitresses on both occasions were pretty inattentive and had to be retrieved in order to make any subsequent requests. Overall, I'm a little disappointed as this place has the potential to be a very good little eatery. I think a little too much value is placed on having three people handle front-of-house and not enough emphasis on quality service (including a little flexibility in when something can be ordered).",

We had lunch here - my partner had the chorizo flatbread, which he wasn't a fan of because the cheese didn't go well with the pesto. I had a smoked salmon salad, which was delicious. It took a while to get served - after waiting for a while, I finally managed to get a hold of a waiter. That said, the restaurant has a beautiful interior and it's dog friendly.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like The Refinery, and in many ways I do after visiting yesterday, however what has driven me to give such a low score is the level of ambient noise. It's unbelievably loud!! Or at least it was on 2 August.  The food was lovely, the staff were attentive, the facilities and decor were clean, modern and fitting. However when I can barely hear what my date is saying, or what the waiting staff are saying, then something is wrong ... and it's not my hearing!  Looking around the tables I guess others had the same problem, because it was a sea of people sitting staring at phone screens rather than chatting. Turn the music down a little, and add some sound deadening so that the noise of food preparation and serving doesn't reverberate and echo around every fixture and fitting, then this place could become a 3.5.",

    "text": "It was a beautiful experience. In Edinburgh, a sign of a lovely restaurant seems to be a genuinely, lovely person to greet you at the front door. We were seated in a lovely booth which matched the very cool, woodsy decor. The waiter worked efficiently and our food was out quickly. Although, I believe maybe he didn't understand my dialect fully, I did get a wrong order of fries, but it was no massive deal, I ate them anyway because they were beautiful as was the burger. Perfectly cooked and presented.   I think a big relief was the bill at the end. For such a beautiful place in a beautiful area the price , you would expect, would be extortionate. However , this isn't the case. The price was extremely reasonable. 10 out of 10",
