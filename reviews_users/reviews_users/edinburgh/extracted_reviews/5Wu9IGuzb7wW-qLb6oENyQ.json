Okay, so preparing it at home when the scottish rain is pelting down doesn't even come close to comparing to sitting outside one of the cafes lining the main square in Krakow's old town, it's as close as I'm going to get and Bona Deli stocks pretty much every Polish foodstuff there is.  Unlike most delis, they don't feel the need to ridiculously overprice things just because they're \"independent\".  And the value is matched not only by the authenticity but also by the friendly service, you'll always get a smile and a hello when you go in.",

    "text": "Great selection of Polish products! I particularly like the sweet buns and hams available in the shop. The prices are also competitive. But...  One MASSIVE negative thing about Bona Deli is customer service... actually a lack of it. Being Polish myself, I was delighted to find this lovely little shop next to my new workplace. With a perfect location,  I was hoping that it would be \"my\" shop. At first, I was positively surprised with the selection of products available. Then, I met a very unpleasant lady by the till. She seemed to be very angry that I dared to enter the shop and forced her to complete the purchase. Thinking that she may have simply had a bad day, I was not completely put off.   Today I visited the shop again. Unfortunately, the experience was literally the same. Two grumpy ladies (one blonde in her thirties with glasses, the other in her fifties). I went to the till with a few things I wanted to buy. The older one just looked at me, with a bored and annoyed facial expression, started scanning the items. Than she just said the amount I was due to pay. That's it. No hello, good bye, just nothing. The other one was just standing, completely ignoring me. I literally felt offended by this level of customer service and ashamed that this type of \"ladies\" represent Polish people abroad. I work myself in Customer Services and honestly... I think I would give up on training these two. It's simply lack of manners.  I'm not a fussy person...I'm usually happy with whatever I get. On this occasion I could not believe how ignorant a person could be. Someone who is supposed to make you feel like you are back in your home country, who is supposed to make you feel slightly less homesick, only makes you feel sad and frustrated.    I will never ever be back again in this shop, even though it does have a potential to be the best Polish store in Edinburgh (with different employees).",

I like the welcome we got when we visited and they have got a lot of speciality meats for sale. (but no Oxtongue..though) Their available variety of Polish and Baltic produce is impressive.   Not too expensive and when I am in the neighbourhood again I  will give them a visit.",

    "text": "Bona Deli is a fantastic delicatessen, selling predominately Polish food in the centre of busy Nicolson Street. I go into this store quite a lot in the mornings for my breakfast on my way to classes to buy their pastries which are simply gorgeous.   They have a good selection of different Polish foods such as gherkins, sausages and, of course, vodka! They also sell herbs and spices such as dill and caraway seeds which can sometimes be difficult to find in the larger food stores.   Bona Deli sell the traditional deli food, with an excellent selection of meats, fish, cheese and fresh bread.  However, with this wide range of food also come the usual expensive deli prices so I tend to think that many of their goods are overpriced.  The staff are always smiling, polite and willing to help you find what you are looking for.",

    "text": "Traditionally, Poland is not recognised for its world class foods - however, without a shadow of a doubt it should be if Bona Deli is a taste of what is to come.  The story goes that when the store first opened, Polish immigrants who hadnt seen thier home for years would come into the deli to smell the smells of Poland. Indeed, the smell of fresh Polish bread often greets you as you enter the small deli situated on South Clerk street.  Bona Deli trades in meats, breads, speciality Polish vodka's (a personal favourite of mine) and various other wonders which I am yet to discover - mainly because the packaging is often in Polish, something I dont speak at all.  While I could sing the praises of Bona Deli all day, it does have a few draw backs - namely the quite expensive prices and how quickly it runs out of its most popular items, more than once causing dissapointment.  Regardless of this however, Bona Deli is a great deli  - with real Polish passion.",

Bona Deli is no exception - from the minute you step in the door you are faced with delicious bread, pastries, dumplings, Polish confectionery and (powers up) - the meat counter! Polish sausage is an out of this world experience that everyone must try once in their life.  They have a great selection of booze that doesn't just consist of vodka - there are some very nice Polish beers that I am eager to try. There are also some polish branded goods in their convenience store section. Lovely, and as appreciated by the Scottish as the Polish quarter of Edinburgh! Friendly service, too. Yum, yum.",

They sell a huge range of authentic Polish ingredients and delicassies ranging from huge bags of things which look like kettle chips to a whole range of pickled vegetables.   Their cured meats section is particularly impressive with a huge selection of smoked hams and cured poultry.  Their cheeses are also tempting with many of them looking - and sounding - obscure, but also delicious.   Bona Deli has an excellent range of food and drink and, although it's understandably pricy, it's well worth the extra money.",

Bona Deli is an excellent resource if you're looking for some Polish food and I was thrilled to see that they sold Almette which is a really creamy Philadelphia type spread that I ate literally every day on my travels through Eastern Europe - it's just so tasty.   I had a great browse around here the other day and was really intrigued by some of the pickled jars, I was also ecstatic to see a wicker basket full of gherkins and I decided to buy a couple to chomp on and they were pickle-tastic.",

The meat is SO well priced so I recommend using them instead of Peckhams if your in the area looking for ham. They also sell Milka chocolates of ALL types which is mega exciting as it's difficult to get hold of such a choice! The shop is really well stocked with all types of polish food, medicines, alcoholic drinks and magazines. The only issue I have is my extreme lack of ability to pronounce the names of the meats so I end up looking like an eejit!",
