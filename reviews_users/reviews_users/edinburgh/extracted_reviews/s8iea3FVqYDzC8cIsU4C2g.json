    "text": "Waiting to head back to Glasgow, my guy and I were in search of something to snack on.  We originally wanted a proper chippy for some chips, but decided to stop here for some chips when we couldn't find a chippy in the area.  When we walked in, just the overall feel and smell of the place was wonderful.  Cozy little place with seating at the window plus one small table.  The guy behind the counter was really nice and friendly and had an overall great personality.  The place looked clean, everything was properly wrapped in the coolers and they have various drinks for sale.  We only ordered chips, which were cooked to order and we were offered numerous sauces for free.  I'm not a fan of vinegar on chips, so we got sweet chili sauce and salt instead.  They were perfectly cooked and tasted amazing.  I think we'll be back next time we're in the area and wanting some chips (and other foods!)",

    "text": "Worst Fish and Chips of all time!!!  Fish and Chips at a Kebab place? Yeah I know, but holy shiz this was bad. We got several orders and could barely finish a few bites. The fish appeared to have gone from frozen to directly fried and it was like eating a rock hard filet of mush. Fries were obviously the packaged frozen type and were horrible too. 90% of the food was thrown away.  We also found a hair as soon as we opened one of the boxes. That along with the food made this an unpleasant experience.",

    "text": "So picture the scene - I'm walking home and it's late. Really late. so late it's almost early and far too late to be walking home in the cold of winter.  I want to eat (and yes I'm more that a little inebriated) so I swing into Ali Baba on my way home. Everything looks a little... funny (and trust me, that's not just because of the beer goggles) so I decide to play it safe and get something that no takeaway in the universe can mess up... Or so I thought...  Falafel is not hard to make. Putting falafel into a pitta with some salad should not be difficult. Evidently somewhere along the way, something is getting lost here as this was one of the most god awful things I have ever eaten.  It's always hard to describe exactly how something tastes bad; after all I tend not to eat bad stuff all too often, so my points of comparison are pretty limited - but hey let's give it a try.  The pitta was all hard and old. Like eating smelly felt. The salad was limp and tasteless. And the falafel? Well it tasted like soap. But not the clean kind, the dirty kind. Dirty soap.  I'm always loathed to completely ward people off a place because of one bad experience but this was so bad I threw it away. I never throw food away, especially not when I've paid for it. Seems like there's now an exception to that rule and being as I don't want to have to throw away more food, I won't be going back to Ali Baba.",
