Standouts were duck croquettes, hake with risotto and basil gnocchi.  The savoury dishes outshone the desserts but it was overall very hard to fault.",

    "text": "The Educated Flea is one of three restaurants making up a local chain and after having been to the Three Birds for my birthday dinner a few weeks prior I was looking forward to trying out their newest place. We made a last minute booking on a Thursday as I'd had a pounding headache all day and having been to work to a training course to book club, I decided I couldn't face cooking. Thankfully they had a table free :)   The restaurant is tiny, maybe 20 covers, so a booking is definitely needed. The menu has a good list of options with daily specials listed as well. On this night we skipped alcohol as my headache didn't require wine to feel worse. We spilt the pistachio and feta dip and some olives and then I had the aubergine parcels. The dip was with us shortly as was a bowl of enormous green olives. The dip was super tasty and just a tiny bit spicy with the olives being super brine-y and really moreish.   Mains arrived in good time and my aubergine parcels were stuffed with smoked aubergine pate on top of herbed rice with tomato and feta. It was a really tasty and fresh dish without being super filling and just what I needed after a super busy day with a pounding headache.  As my head had decided it had enough for that day we skipped pudding and headed on our way.  The bill was quite reasonable at just over 30 for our two mains and shared starters so definitely a place for a refined dinner without a huge cost. Also if you're super hungry I'd recommend the birds and beast board full of meaty treats!",

The food was good, still a few things to fine tune, but nothing to complain about.  It's a small space as Fiona said, but it's nicely furnished and feels quite spacious.  Would happily come back for another meal. Nice to have some new options on Broughton Street to add to the old faithfuls!",

I had an amazingly delicious vegetarian dish with quinoa and vegetables, and a glass of wine, and enjoyed the view out the window. It was perfect. The presentation was outstanding, the waitstaff just attentive enough. Lots of conversation going on around me, but the noise level was just fine. Menu is wonderful: lots of great options for a vegetarian. I wanted to try everything, so will definitely return when next in Edinburgh.",

It's a smaller sized restaurant but airy with contemporary decor, so it's a nice space to spend time in. Staff were very friendly and informed about the food. Wine we chose was really good. For veggie me, the choice was great - fab range of vegetables and pulses being used in the cooking.",

My partner is gluten and lactose allergic and they catered fantastically to her. We always need to worry about cross contamination but since the restaurant is \"naturally gluten free\" there was no worry and we enjoyed a relaxed meal for a very reasonably price. The gluten free bread was fantastic (especially with the Smoked shallot vinegar), and both the main dishes we had (duck leg and venison) were to die for. I am super excited to try the other restaurants under the owners (3Birds and Apiary) and will be extremely happy if they are half as good as this.",

We did dessert and coffee, and saw the several potential customers come in without reservations, and had to be turned away- tells you something good about the restaurant.  So, service was excellent as was the food!  Will try one of Kath's other restaurants this trip (Apiary) and I assume it will be as excellent. Would for sure recommend, and if not for living in the US would make this a regular stop.",

The food is incredible and you can tell that every dish is a well thought out combination of ingenuity and expertise on a plate. All this without being intimidating or overly showy. It's just good food and really enjoyable dining. The chef, staff, and owner really go out of their way to make you feel like they've been waiting for you to stop in their whole lives...like you're family or friends of the family. Chef is a charmer. Food is exciting. Staff is friendly. What else  could you ask for. Pistachio feta dip and coconut sorbet are must haves. Brisket is delish. Prawn starter salad is fresh and so tasty.
