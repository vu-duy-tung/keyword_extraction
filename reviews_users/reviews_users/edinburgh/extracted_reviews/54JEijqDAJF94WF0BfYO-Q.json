You may be tempted to turn on your heel and leave as soon as you enter this establishment, but persevere and you should be happily surprised!  A definite must have is the Roti Cenai...2 very puffy, and tasty Roti bread served with a curry dip. I would suggest sharing this with a friend with your main meal as its quite filling.   After deliberating over the extensive menu, filled with chicken, meat, veggie, rice and noodley dishes, I decided on chicken curry rice. Doesn't sound too exciting, but was mega tasty. Big chunks of chicken sat on an abundance of rice, onion and carrot, covered in a dry curry sauce. Noms.  It's worthwhile to note that the chicken comes on the bone in big chunks, you won't know what part of the chicken you're eating, but the taste is worth it.  The pearl tea is also pretty cute :)   Price wise, not too expensive at all. Worth a wee look,",

I'd heard rumours of their laksa (I love coconut milk in food very much), but never managed to get there until after going to a massive poetry event at Queen's Hall. I was starving, so that probably helped (since we all know hunger is the best ingredient), but getting handed a massive bowl of laksa (and I'm talking HUGE) that I only paid 6 pounds for, was definitely a highlight of my year. That might be an overstatement.  It's a teensy restaurant, and it's quite popular, so sometimes you might find that you won't get a seat. We were lucky since there were only two of us. The service was really quick, and even though I managed to spill water and lassi everywhere (over the table and myself), they didn't ridicule me or make me feel guilty, which is always a plus.   I definitely recommend going. Give yourself some time to look through the whole menu (it's overwhelming how much tasty stuff they have on it). And maybe go with a smaller group so that you're guaranteed a seat.",

I chose to ignore the shoddy toilet facilities, lack of music, and incomprehensible waitress as the food was all top notch.    I tried the Malaysian Roti for starters (a light fluffy bread with a spicy, coconut dipping sauce) and then followed that with the Beef Sambal (fried beef in a hot pepper and onion sauce). All tasty stuff and atypical to many other Asian cuisine restaurants.  The restaurant is tiny and often busy. The food is inexpensive and I can assure once you've fathomed the menu and necked a few Tiger beers, you'll be pleasantly surprised.",

Their noodle soups are still reasonably priced, but of poor value -- the meat and ingredients are typically of very poor quality, e.g., rough, dry, tiny. Satay chicken are dry, hard, and very pricey. Meats in dishes are quite sparing in amount. I wish there was a good Malaysian restaurant in Edinburgh. There is another with a very very limited menu, but higher quality. We will visit Kampong Ah Lee now only if I am very desperate now. If they could improve their quality or lower their prices back to a reasonable level, we would come back.",

    "text": "I think this is the best Malaysian/Singaporean food I've had outside of Singapore. I visited Kampong Ah Lee twice in my five days in Edinburgh so you know it's good! I heard it had recently been renovated and it's now quite a pretty restaurant.   The first time I came we shared two dishes, the spicy chicken and the duck breast, which we supplemented with vegetables and oil rice. I really enjoyed both dishes. The duck was my favorite, and it tasted really delicious with the oil rice, but I also enjoyed the chicken. I also had teh tarik which is always a favorite, and it didn't disappoint here!  The second time I came, I couldn't resist the Hainan chicken rice. I'm used to eating chicken rice from an old shop in Singapore, so I wasn't sure how a Scottish restaurant could compare, but I was pleasantly surprised. The chicken was moist and flavorful, with a nice sauce. Of course the rice was delicious and tasted great mixed with the sauce and the chicken too! This time I got the Nestlo (coffee + Milo) which was a nice refreshing drink for late morning.   I wish I could come here every day, but alas, it's far away (though less far than actual Malaysia). If you live near Kampong Ah Lee, consider yourself lucky.",

My partner doesn't generally like pickled (SE) Asian vegetables, but said that the achar was the best pickle he'd ever had. Pretty delicious, tasted like a peanut sauce with sweet rice wine vinegar and sambal olek. My anise and ginger duck was great as was his pork belly and noodles.

    "text": "If this place gave frequent flyer miles, I'd be well on my way to a round the world trip. I've eaten my body weight in their tasty Malaysian treats a few times over since discovering Kampong Ah Lee 5 or so years ago. The flavours that await you inside are just as bold as the red and yellow exterior that brightens up Nicolson Street.   This isn't michelin dining, but neither are the prices. It's authentic, hearty food served up in a cafe style setting. Service is usually straight to the point rather than overtly warm but that suits me just fine. I'm here for the eats, not the small talk.  For the uninitiated, Malaysian food is a bit of a melting point of asian cuisines - Indian meets Chinese, meets Thai, meets my mouth. I've slowly worked my way through the menu and there aren't many dishes I wouldn't recommend. Personal highlights are:  Roti canai - Flaky, buttery roti with a Malaysian curry sauce for dipping. Beef belly curry - slow cooked and melts in the mouth every time. Sweet & spicy prawns - prawns bigger than your finger in a sticky (but not gloopy) sweet sauce. These are served up in their shells, so avoid if you're not a fan having to get your hands dirty before you can tuck in. Curry Laksa - a big huge curry noodle soup bowl. More than enough for two if you can cope with sharing.  It's so good in fact, that at least a couple of times a year I go into panic mode fearing that someday it may close and cut off my fix. Not that this seems likely as they are going from strength to strength and building something of a monopoly in the Malaysian eatery scene in Edinburgh. From this small cafe they've now grown to 3 locations across the city.    But better safe than sorry though - get along or I'll hold you all personally responsible if there's a big Kampong Ah Lee shaped hole in my future.",

Definitely not disappointed! For under 30 quid, we had more than enough tasty food to stuff ourselves full. And the food was delicious. I have two pet peeves concerning Asian foods in general in the UK: 1) the flavors are often a bit muted, and 2) from dish to dish, there tends to be a lack of variety in tastes. The food at Kampong Ah Lee easily cleared both of these hurdles of mine--not only was the food very well-spiced, but each dish also had its own, distinct flavor. YES. So refreshing to eat here. I especially recommend the roti canai here--I could honestly sit down with just four servings of it for myself.  The waitstaff were courteous and helpful (and prompt!), but not at all overbearing like how I feel it they can be in a lot of restaurants around here.  Honestly, we have no complaints at all about this place, and plan on visiting again over and over again. Great value for great food!  PS: If you live further west in Edinburgh, you can opt to go to Kampong Ali (on Fountainbridge), instead! It's their sister restaurant, and we loved it there, too, the one time we went.",

The Roti Cenai starts you off as the meal intends to go on - full of fire - but my only wish would be that the delicious curry sauce was slightly thicker to dip my chapatti-like flatbread into. The boy discovered oil cooked rice is delicious (I felt every delicious bit of cholesterol through every bite of rice) and I don't think anyone escaped the chilli-fire that breathed it's way through every dish. For me, the sea bass (complete with head, for those of a sensitive nature) with tom yum sauce was stunning - the sauce was fantastic and the fish beautifully cooked. For what we ate, the price was pretty reasonable and you can see why the place is so popular.   The downfalls - not too many to be honest - one would be that I had no idea what half the meals were (there was one along the lines of King Kang....chortle) which without having the staff go through the menu line by line made it a bit harder to choose - although google helped me when I checked the online menu in advance. But take the plunge, you might find you will like it. The other was that staff were pretty abrupt, so wasn't ever quite sure they had my order (they did, I'm just paranoid). But overall, it is definitely a gem, and glad Joe A. introduced us to it!",

    "text": "It was with great joy and laughter that I came to experience Kampong Ah Lee with some of Edinburgh's finest a couple of weeks ago at an \"all welcome Yelp meet up for dinner\" - note to self; think of a snappier title.  Whilst I was at first surprised (and perhaps a little concerned) by the cafe stylings of Kampong, the food more than made up for it. I feel the need to repeat that last sentence. The food MORE than made up for it.  Joe A highyl recommended the roti to start with, and Jurgen D and I weren't arguing! Now I've had roti before, and I mean loads of times - and for me it's never really had the same draw as any other kind of accompanying bread; always just... plain and boring. The roti at Kampong though was enough to completely change my opinion of asia's favourite unleavened bread - it was fresh, delicious and served with a side of curry dipping sauce that had just the right mix of spice and flavour to accompany bread that would have been good enough to eat on its own.  Whilst most others round the table went for exotic named and looking dishes, I (being full of a cold) plumped for the rather unimaginative chicken curry noodles. Of all the dishes, this was perhaps the most ronseal of the lot - it did exactly what it said on the tin. The chicken wasn't flavourless pieces of breast meat, but chunks of chicken akin to those seen in any number of asian chop shops around the world; full of fatty bits and bones yes - but all the tastier for it. A good sized portion was offered and the noodles and dry sauce were just right for this (what would be considered in other places to be) boring dish to be something that I'd order again.   It didn't matter all too much that it was just before pay day either as the menu ranged from 7 for my chicken curry noodles to Jenny L and Catriona C's 12+ fish - something for everyone then; providing of course that you can figure out what it is you're ordering off the menu!",

    "text": "I've heard tales of Malaysian Delight. I've heard Chinese whispers that have made it all the way west to Glasgow, that this place could rival the infamous Asia Style. Could it be True, I thought?  Having walked past this joint numerous times I never once realised it was in fact a restaurant. From the outside it just looks like a bog standard take away. But you'd be a fool (as I am) for thinking so.  Its a pretty basic, canteen style restaurant, but its clean with a homely feel. We opted for the classic Malaysian Roti and Chicken Wings to start. Followed by an aubergine and minced pork stir fry with coconut rice. It was all pretty delicious, roti wasn't as light and fluffy as I would have thought, and the chicken wings we ordered were not the ones that arrived, although they were great all the same, so no drama.  Grub was washed down with a big pot of tea for a quid and the final bill was delightfully cheap.  Another visit will help me establish if its any better than it's western foe, but I certainly won't be walking by this place again without diving in for a good nosh.",

    "text": "This Malaysian take away on Clerk Street is a welcome change from the slew of Indian and Chinese take aways surrounding it! It's evening got a raving review in a newpaper stuck in the display window.  The menu is not as easy to decipher as I would have liked, and some of the dishes are so foreign to the westerners palate you can tell they've maintained a lot of the authenticity of Malaysian cuisine. I was adviced to order some Roti Cenai, basically a flat bread with came with an awesome curry sauce. I'm also a big fan of coconut rice in any cuisine, and had that with a delicious chicken curry, which I think was called Kari Ayam.   It was a great food experience all over, I just hope I'll be lucky with the menu again next time!",

It resembled onion pancakes more than the puffier and lighter roti canai that I've had in before in other restaurants in Singapore and California.  Curry sauce was nice though.  Nasi Lemak was also just OK.  It was supposed to be coconut rice, but it just seemed like regular long grain to me.  Did not notice any coconut flavor. It came with some fried anchovies, peanuts, a bit of pickled veg, 1/2 a boiled egg and some chicken curry.",

Yum!  The trouble is though that even with the big portions of good food, the price of this place is expensive. Also, staff are a bit on the grumpy side, but that is just a minor annoyance.",

At this fine little establishment there's heaps and heaps of tofu deliciousness filled dishes for me to enjoy.  Now don't get me wrong there's plenty of veggie goodness all over the 'burgh... but what self respecting date of mine wouldn't love some hearty beef meat? Ill tell you. None.  I like me some cavemen-lumberjack types... so I can't help but want to be the dainty animal-loving lady accompanying m'lord who obviously hunts and eats his own food... preferably with his bare hands.   This place allows for that.   I can have a perfectly heaping plate of bean curd and vegetation while he knaws at some gristle. (Can Scottish East Asians PLEASE start calling it tofu? Bean curd and fermented bean curd sounds so - gross.) And... they're both delicious.   And they give me chopsticks. 'Cause just 'cause I'm a nerdy white girl doesn't mean I don't know how to use chopsticks - thank you for understanding that.   And the rice dishes come with - What now? What's that you say? Oh, yes... rice (no charging extra!).   I will be back early and often for all sorts of curd-y delights. Happy belly.",

It's the sort of place you can easily walk past without going in; the interior isn't pretty, and it doesn't look much from the inside, but once you're in there you're in for a treat!  I would recommend the rendang beef. My best friend from high school was very annoyed when he read my review of Kampong Ah Lee and realised I'd been without inviting him, and without ordering Rendang Beef.   Their noodles can be a bit greasy, but I do love greasy noodles. It's perfect for some late night soul food.",

    "text": "One of my favourite questions I get asked about my travels is 'what was your favourite meal?'.  Hands down, the answer to this is Beef Rendang; a Malaysian dry curry I discovered, funnily enough, in an Asian food court in Sydney of all places! And as testament to the dish, if I was blown away by a $4 food court hot plate version of this dish.... boy, I had NO idea what was coming to me from an authentic Malaysian kitchen!  I have to say I'm disappointed by the lack of Malaysian restaurants in Edinburgh. Old Penang closed down recently, which leaves only 2.... and I'm starting to wonder if I'll ever even remember the name of the other one because Kampong Ahlee is deeeelightful!!  Stopped by for lunch yesterday, ready to have my first authentic Rendang, and if disappointment is London, my reaction is Tokyo! Absolutely stunning food. I clearly made the right choice as both my eating partners ended up resenting their own selection after tasting my exquisite Beef Rendang! I also had a starter of Roti breads with curry dipping sauce... a little heavy, one would've been enough but that's hardly a complaint is it?  Honestly I couldn't see how I was ever going to try anything else off the menu, until the table next to ours was presented with a dish of Malaysian Spicy Fish.... the WHOLE fish! Looked amazing... my next visit is decided!  Quaint little place, low on frills and high on quality food. As for staff, well you get what you give.... we had some good banter and the waiter was happy to join in. Decent prices considering the standard of the food. Another of those little Edinburgh secrets as it really is a case of blink and you'll miss it if you're passing (pretty much opposite the old Odeon) as it's flanked by Newington's vast selection of off-the-wall trinket shops.  Find it. Try it. Love it.",

    "text": "Ate here last night with a selection of Yelp Elite and friendly alcoholics :) This was my first jaunt to a Malaysian restaurant in Edinburgh and im please to say it was a happy one. This places delivers simple food that is packed full on flavour   I started with the roti with curry sauce, roti is as simple a bread as you can imagine served with a small pot of sauce that initially blows your head off then you adjust to the hot, sweet and powerful taste of the chili's. Very nice!   I then had a dish from the Malay specials, aubergine with salted fish and minced pork. Cracker of a dish, beautiful soft aubergine with flakes of fish and pieces of octopus, with the pork in the sauce was reallya great dish. For me could have used just a touch of sunbal but really very nice.   The service was pretty good, you have who I presume is the owner out front serving everyone with his wife and daughter manning the bar. If I had to criticise..... would this woman please smile!!! She has a look on her like you wouldn't believe! But really im all about the food and it was good, not unreal outstanding but really good meal at a good price.   Jd = happy man!",
