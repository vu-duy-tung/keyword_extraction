    "text": "myself and a bunch of co-workers headed here last night for a bit of dinner before a night out.  we booked our table for 6pm to take advantage of the very reasonably priced pre-theatre menu.  the menu also had a very nice selection of starters and mains with a whole separate set of options for the vegetarian people.  i had a brave moment when making my dinner decisions and veered from my favourite dish of pad thai and went for the green curry instead.  this was preceded by lovely fried triangles filled with prawn and crab meat with a sweet chili dipping sauce.  the triangles had a nice crispy texture and a good filling of minced prawn and crab meat that was very tastily seasoned.  my green curry (with egg fried rice) was very very tasty and a bit on the spicer side.  despite the extra kick of spice, i enjoyed my green curry very much and didn't miss my usual pad thai at all.  i'd happily go back and try some other dishes as everyone else seemed to be enjoying their dinner just as much as me.  i also need to comment on the excellent and very patient waiting staff.  we were greeted warmly when entering the restaurant and although there were other diners and we were clearly having a very wine flowingly good time, no one ever asked us to quiet down or stop expressing our merriment of a nice meal and drinks on a friday night after work. this is always greatly appreciated as it's no fun to feel like naughty school children for having a proper laugh while enjoying good company just because you've been told to shush.  so many thanks to the lovely staff for understanding this.  the 4 stars instead of 5 was for their BYOB corkage charge.  5 per bottle!!!!!  which they made sure to charge us for every bottle (about 6 i think) siting on the table that was open....  if they brought this down to 3 i'd happily give them the fifth star.",

    "text": "I had lunch here a while back, but from what I can remember it was really nice, but I haven't been back since, perhaps because the type of cuisine isn't my favourite, or perhaps because it just wasn't that memorable.  From the outside, I thought the place looked a bit like a sunbed shop with the tropical looking window stickers, but inside it is really quite nice. My friend and I went just after the lunch menu had finished at 2.30 which I thought was quite early, but we stayed none the less.   I had the King prawn Tom Yum soup which was lovely, and cost about 5.50, not too bad considering the portion was quite big. Some of the mains were quite expensive thought and although I would have liked a seafood dish I decided against it as they were 14-16 each, too much for my lunchtime budget.  I would be interested to come back and sample the lunchtime set menu to see if the deals are any better on that, otherwise it was a nice restaurant and I had a pleasant lunch.",

While some restaurants seem to cater their food to meet the western palate this one generally offers good authentic Thai food as it should be served. The three of us ordered 2 curries and a Pad Thai. The curry dishes were top notch, while the Pad Thai was overly sweet. Service was very friendly.",

I've been a few times  including on the important occasion of my hen night, as well as the night before my wedding. I chose it for because I knew, from previous visits, that top class food, service and atmosphere were all guaranteed  and I wasn't disappointed. Pad Thai is a really good way to judge a Thai restaurant  it's such a classic that if you find a good one, you know that the rest of the food's going to be good. Phuket Pavilion's is delicious  bursting with flavour (enough tamarind, for once!) and zest, with the noodles cooked just right. My mouth is watering, just thinking about it! The staff are lovely, so friendly and warm, and the food really is delicious. The location is handy, but quiet  tucked away, just off Leith Walk, with plenty of good pubs and bars within easy walking distance. Highly recommended (especially if you get a table by the window, so you can watch the world go by) - it's everything you could want from a Thai restaurant.",

The interior is immaculate and the tables are set beautifully. I decided to order what I consider to be basic 'standards': chicken satay skewers followed by pad thai. I've often ordered these dishes in other restaurants and so they make a good basis for comparison.   The chicken skewers were nicely charred from the grill and came with a wonderfully thick and nutty satay dip. The pad thai looked a bit plain when it arrived, but the taste was anything but. Both dishes were enjoyable in a simple, unfussy kind of way. I'm looking forward to trying some of the more interesting choices on the menu.   One thing to note; they're quite busy on weekends so you may need to book.",

Nice decoration, and decent, but discreet, lighting - no straining to see the menu or wonder what is on the plate! Good value for money.

    "text": "I am sure I have written a review for this place before but think it's worth updating it.   This is by far one of my favourite restaurants in Edinburgh. And anywhere really. I'll tell you why...  Firstly, the food is always outstanding. I typically go chicken or prawn panang. It's gorgeous. And sometimes gaeng massaman. Also gorgeous. I've tried a few of their stir-frys which are equally as lovely and I think once Pad Thai...always yummy. But in a thai restaurant like this I tend to steer clear of Pad Thai as there's so many gorgeous dishes. I like to try a different starter each time I go and I have never been disappointed.   Secondly, Everything always tastes fresh and flavourful. I find the portions to be slightly large unless I'm sharing with someone. Between a starter and main you're stuffed.   Thirdly, I tend to eat here once a month, sometimes twice because of the above (and I love Thai food) but mainly for the fact that the owner and staff are just absolutely lovely. They always greet us warmly and the ones that recognise us always ask how we are. I have been bringing my son (7 now) here since he was 4 and they are as happy to receive him now as they were then. And they often give him a free kids ice-cream because they are just awesome like that. Not once have I ever been uncomfortable eating there with my son. They never made me feel awkward or badly for when he was messier and louder. They have always been brilliant.   Fourthly, to expand on my previous point they so obviously love their local repeat customers. I just recently went for dinner here for my birthday. The owner who had come over to chat with us asked what we were celebrating and when I told him he graciously offered is desserts on the house :) who would mind that?! (Just to point out it there was only 2 of us)  Fifthly, I don't love their dessert selection and I LOVE dessert. But I don't care as I'm too full from the amazing starter and mains. However I had the lemon sorbet and that was really nice. Came in a real frozen lemon as well!   So that's my love of Phuket Pavillion in 5 crucial points I suppose. I could talk about their prices but let's be realistic...Thai food in Edinburgh is pricey. And there's a few better known places that have the worst service and average food that charge the same or more (chaopraya for one).",

I had a dispute with my bill after I had paid in which I had asked for the pre-theatre special and instead was charged full price; I noticed it as I was signing the receipt. This was a difference of maybe three pounds but played a factor in why I ordered what I ordered so I politely asked the restaurant to honor their menu pricing. An older gentleman (I use that term loosely) working the front register was getting increasingly agitated about my request to the eventual point of throwing coins at me and telling me \"I hope we won't ever see you here again.\" Um...what!?!?! So much for professionalism!  He also never acknowledged the fact that I was right! I hope he is the owner because I would hate for someone to be paying this man to run their business in this manner.  Love it or hate it, the customer is always right (within reason) in the restaurant business but I will honor this very unfriendly man's request with pleasure.",

I had ordered a main dish from the theater menu, and when the bill had come around I noticed a couple pounds discrepancy in the price and commented on it. The older gentleman was extremely rude and insulted my intelligence by telling me to recheck the receipt which was \"right\". I left to go outside and check the menu on the door. When I came back to the front and pointed it out on the menu, he refused to apologize,  began to belittle me, and begrudgingly gave me the change only after the waitress graciously admitted her mistake. He then told me he never wished to see me at his establishment again. It was a small mistake that I would have been fine with if he simply admitted to it instead of blaming me,  the customer, and making me feel like an idiot for pointing it out. I'm not sure if he was being extremely rude and dismissive because I'm a tourist, a woman, or what.. But it was a horrible experience.",

    "text": "I enjoyed my experience here. The food was all delicious, the decor was nice - very Thai themed but not naff, and the service was ok.   I had steamed prawns to start and my partner had deep fried chicken and veg parcels. They were both really tasty, you got a lot of large prawns - 8 I think and they came with a very spicy lemon chilli dip (if you're not a fan of spicy food I'd avoid that because I have a very high tolerance and my mouth was still stinging afterwards). Boyfriend had a Pad Cha, a spicy chicken stir-fried dish with noodles and I had the Gaeng Dang mild red curry which was one of the tastiest dishes I have ever eaten! There was a very big portion of curry and not that much rice so I would have preferred a better balance.  This place is quite pricey - infact I think the '' at the top is a bit misleading, if you're going for dinner I'd say this is a '' place, we spent over 33 each for two courses (though that did include a bottle of wine to share). But generally I thought the food was worth it, and I liked the little touches like having a carved carrot flower on the salad. The cutlery is fancy and unusual too which I thought was a nice Thai touch. You also get a bowl of prawn crackers included.  I didn't think the service was great to be honest - considering the other reviews I thought staff would be a bit more attentive but they must have been on an off night. They weren't unfriendly but they weren't particularly nice either. The order taking was rather rushed and I asked for a certain bottle of wine but was brought one that was a few pounds dearer - the girl who brought it did show us the bottle before pouring but I didn't remember the names and didn't realise it was a different one until later.  To sum up, I would recommend Phuket Pavilion for the food and the atmosphere. The service was only ok on this occasion and the food was rather pricey. I'd be more likely to return for a cheaper, lunch or pre-theatre menu. Well the Gaeng Dang could maybe tempt me back for full price...",

Bill scores cool points because he's been to Lagos, where I'm from, and the menu isn't too shabby either! It's extremely well thought out and one definitely isn't spoilt for choice. The food, thai cuisine, includes several starters (over fifteen!) as well as soup, duck, seafood, and curry specialities! They've also got a long list of offerings for vegetarians, such as starters, soups and curry dishes.   The restaurant is quite large, and if one ventures in far enough, there's a room with a whole wall covered in a painting of a far away, warm tropical place that is definitely NOT Edinburgh. Forgive the negativity, but the weather at the moment is quite depressing. I'm off point.  A friend and I split the Gaeng Dang, which is a delicious red curry dish that we chose to have with King Prawns. O.M.G!",

Phuket is an island off the coast of Thailand whose food, although characteristically Oriental, has its own unique style and flavour combinations.  The mood feels really relaxed and tranquil with soft lighting and gentle music, very fitting for the 'island' theme of the restaurant.   The menu is extensive with an ecclectic range of curry, seafood, duck and stir fry dishes.  I went for the chicken penang with egg fried rice which came in a filling portion and a hot, creamy sauce.  We all thought the food was great and it seemed to take no time at all to arrive.  Further, it's moderately pirce, only costing about 15 per person which makes it a viable option for a tasty meal out.",

Food was brought quickly to out table, all really fresh, well seasoned and presented. Service was really polite and quick too, without feeling rushed though. They had a pre-theatre menu for dinner with good vegetarian options, also I found it very well priced for the quality and amount of food. Their Tom Yam soup was a bit too spicy for us as we always expect it mild and at this time it wasn't, so be aware, their Tom Yam is HOT. I ordered a red curry with peanuts and veggies it was really yummy and mild so it was a refresher after my very spicy soup. Would definitely be back again.",

I think all Indian and Thai restaurants should not charge for rice (like in the US), but I get that I am not in the US.  It is OBSCENE to charge carry out container and packaging of 15 GBP. What the hell? I've never heard of such a thing! It was as much as the coat of my food!!!! That's crazy!",

    "text": "Great decor and service, the food is amazing but perhaps a little westernised.  I have been at Phuket Pavilion before and revisited last Saturday with a friend. Because anything peanut-sauce is my guilty pleasure, I had chicken satay for a starter. My partner in crime had the veggie satay option, which came with mushrooms. Can't go wrong with satay for me, so no qualms about this one.  I had a Thai beer with my food, and my friend a Thai icetea. I had never heard of that, but boy is it tasty! Super sweet juice with coconut cream and whipped cream on top, wow!  Then our main meals arrived, beef pad cha for me. I asked about the spice level because it is described as \"spicy\" on the menu, and the girl did say it was quite spicy but they could make it milder. Because I am used to \"western medium spice levels\", I did ask to make it milder. When eating my meal I did regret it, because it wasn't spicy at all anymore. Don't get me wrong, it was still amazingly fragrant with other lovely spices and super tasty, but a little bit more chili would have been welcome!  The service was excellent, the girls dress in traditional clothes which look lovely. The decor, including the tables and cutlery are all Asian, which gives a great atmosphere. All in all, I will definitely come back again, and will try not be a wuss about spicy food!",

So last night, wanting a quick meal, noodles and salad were the perfect answer.  Phuket Pavilion is lovely - friendly staff, free prawn crackers (I'm not sure how Thai that is, but they're good!) and tasty food. I'll leave the pad thai review to Jason, the expert, but man, that somtam salad was spicy and fresh and delicious. I want some more now....",

Need to go check it out again next time I'm in that part of town, but as the SO has decided that we no longer like musicals, it might be a while...   The main courses were seriously some of the tastiest Thai food I'd had in a while without being overly sweet, salty, or spicy.   Would recommend checking it out for a reasonably priced pre-theatre meal.",

    "text": "I LOVE Thai food. Ever since I skeptically discovered it by being dragged by a Thai friend to her parents' delicious Thai establishment in Tennessee years ago, I've held a special place for it in my heart (and tummy). So when a friend and I first ventured out to find some delicious Thai to stuff in our gullets in Edinburgh, we decided upon Phuket Pavillion. And an excellent choice it was!   The Pavillion is seated right along Leith Walk, so if you live in the area, thumbs up for you! It's tastefully decorated and just big enough to feel suitable for anything from a casual date night to hanging out with friends--we did book in advance, which I would recommend for others, especially on busy weekend nights. The service was prompt and very friendly, and the food and drinks were brought out in no time. My thai tea was just how I remembered them. If you've never tried one, do, because it's a delightful treat!  My only real qualm with our choices for the evening was in my veggie satay starter. Before becoming a veg-head, I used to eat chicken satay gay with reckless abandon (it's GOOD). So when I saw a veggie option, I decided to try it. I was a bit disappointed when the mushrooms that arrived on a skewer hadn't been seasoned at all: it was just that, mushrooms on a skewer. The peanut sauce that comes along with it totally made up for it, but considering how amazingly flavorful the chicken satay is alone, I felt a bit miffed. No worries though, because my main knocked my socks right off! I ordered a red curry with bean curd, and it was absolutely incredible--one of those meals that you just can't stop eating, too gluttonous to leave any nibbles behind! As my partner in crime for the evening Marijke mentioned, her meal wasn't very spicy as far as Thai food goes, and mine was the same. I'm no spice connoisseur, but I wouldn't have minded a real kick to my curry. Mmmm!  Regardless, Phuket Pavillion is a delightful joint, and it totally satiated my lusting for a delicious Thai meal. Would return in the future!",
