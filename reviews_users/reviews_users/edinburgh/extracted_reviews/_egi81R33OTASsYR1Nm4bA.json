    "text": "Found this place looking for a casual spot for dinner near our hotel and they did not disappoint! The food was excellent, including vegetarian/vegan options and a mini 3-course kids' menu. Servers were all very friendly, drink & food portions were generous, and we all left stuffed. That said, we also left a bit hard of hearing because THIS PLACE IS LOUD. Like, REALLY LOUD.   There were only a few tables of people when we got there - maybe 30 patrons in the whole space - which is pretty big & open, and the noise was kinda crazy. We sat down to check out the menu, and I could barely hear what my friend was saying and he was only 5' away.   By the time we left, the restaurant was filling up and incomprehensibly noisy. They need to hang some drapes from the ceilings or on the walls to absorb some of the sound.   4 solid stars for excellent food and friendly servers. -1 Star for insanely loud atmosphere.",

    "text": "Edinburgh has a number of newish burger and/or pizza places & Foundry 39 is amongst the youngest of those.  I visited it last Friday night with two friends after having won a 35 tab in a List competition, just so that's out there.  As a result of the above only one of us actually sampled any food but apparently the cheese burger was good. Beer-wise the place has a middling number of different products in bottles and on draught but within that the variety is reasonable and they state on the menu that they rotate some of the draught products regularly. Pint prices, for an eatery, weren't too bad (nothing over about 4.80). The spirit and wine lists looked to be of a size you'd expect.  The service was good and it was never hard to attract a server's attention in order to have another round brought over. Whether you'd want to come in just for drinks is though debateable, particularly on a Friday, when they have a band on. If you're eating you've less time for conversation so not being able to hear those you're with is not an issue but, when just drinking chat is the order of the day.  Admittedly the table we were allocated was right in front of the band (who were loud but didn't really seem to have the soul to play soul) so there may be parts of the place less impacted by the entertainment but a decision needs to be made as to whether tables make way for possible dancing or the band are turned down so that conversations can be maintained, if the aim is to have customers stay longer than the time it takes to wolf down a burger.",

    "text": "40 taps of the same 10 beers 4 times doesn't count as 40 taps. The kitchen  closes before your appetite does; the beers they advertise on 4 different taps aren't on apparently. I've passed this place everyday for 8 months thinking it would be an unique beer bar experience and was sorely mistaken.",

    "text": "Cool, relaxed vibe from one of Edinburgh's newest cocktail and burger bar. We came here on a drizzly Saturday night and expected it to be a lot busier than it was especially since it was pretty new and I'd heard a lot of good things on social media. This place is also pretty big so it does make it a lot quieter and more intimate than a regular bar on a Saturday night, not necessarily a bad thing. My boyfriend and I ordered the caramel and chilli chicken wings to start and HELL these were the best chicken wings I've probably ever eaten - they tasted like the coating of a toffee apple but with chicken and with a tasty kick of spice. They were amazing and would recommend going just for these. We ordered 10 to share (it was more like 15) for 10 but you can order 20 if you're feeling ambitious. For mains I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken burger with hot sauce and blue cheese mayo and my boyfriend ordered the spicy pepperoni pizza and we had a side of sweet potato fries to share. To drink I had a margarita and my bf had a beer. All in all everything was delicious and really good value!",
