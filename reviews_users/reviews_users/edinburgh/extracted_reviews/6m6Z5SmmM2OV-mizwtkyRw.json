    "text": "Maybe the best homemade burgers in edinburgh, theve got the seasoning down to perfection. Nothing fancy about the sides or toppings but its all about the meat. Chips are included in the price as wellwhich is a welcome change from the rip off burger restaurants in the city centre.",

    "text": "We ended up here after several recommendations from colleagues and friends.  The service was friendly and we were welcomed and provided drinks quickly. We had the steak sandwich and the cheese burger. The food was delivered quickly, and we really enjoyed it. The steak was a bit tough, but the flavours were nice. The burger was very enjoyable as well.  Diner7 is small, but cozy and the atmosphere is laid back and welcoming. I've been told they're only open on a Friday night - as we've tried to go there for lunch with colleagues a few times, but surprisingly, you didn't get the feeling  that they are arrogant or exclusive.  I would definitely go back to try more of the menu.",

    "text": "I had heard from many places that Diner 7 is a fun American style restaurant at the shore. When I arrived there (and further discovered when looking at the menu), I discovered there is nothing American style about this restaurant, or the food it serves.   Even though it isn't American style, it serves great food (the chips are among the best I've had) at really great prices (everything but the steaks were under 10 and the meals come with both a side salad and chips). I will definitely be going back.",

    "text": "Diner 7 is relatively new small diner that has opened up just near the Shore in Leith. They specialise in burgers and have good selection. They come with chips and salad - great traditional chips.   It's not a huge menu but I think this works well. I had the steak and onion baguette - nice thinly sliced steak and crispy onions.   The decor is very american diner - red booths and formica tables. Always has interesting pics on the wall too.   This isn't a posh place - it's a lovely relaxed, friendly place and very reasonably priced too.",

    "text": "Yet another gem near The Shore in Leith.  And, much like the King's Wark across the bridge, Diner 7 is very reasonably priced for its quality of food.  Come here for some of the best burgers in Edinburgh.  With equally as good carnivorous dishes along with satisfying vegetarian ones (exp. butternut squash and goat cheese pasty - tasty for everyone), you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  This is a small, intimate place, so calling ahead to place a reservation is a good idea. Cheers!",

    "text": "So I'm in Edinburgh for work, on my own, looking for somewhere serving good food but unpretentious enough that I'm not going to feel self-conscious. I'd seen Diner 7's website prior to leaving for Edinburgh, so when I happened to walk by, I had to go in.   The sole waitress was friendly and welcoming, reeling off the beer menu, grabbing my chosen brew and taking my food order  a lamb burger with halloumi and chorizo  within minutes of my arrival, despite the place being close to full.   My burger was huge, almost too big to bite, fresh, beautifully seasoned, and served with lovely fresh, crisp, chunky fries and an equally fresh and crisp dressed side salad. Easily one of the best burgers I've eaten anywhere, including so-called gourmet burger restaurants like London's Hache.   The place was even closer to full by the time I'd finished eating, and as I was taking up a 4 person booth on my own, I fully expected to be politely encouraged to leave. Far from rushing me out, the waitress offered coffee and seemed more than happy for me enjoy my coffee while poring over my newspaper.   Honestly, I can't fault the place. Tasty fresh food, very fair price, warm welcome, great service. Go there immediately!",

    "text": "i swear, diana, im not trying to bash you, ive just had a couple glasses of wine and lived in the same neighborhood as your reviews for a year, but BEST BURGERS??? you have got to be joking me. three doors down at the cameo you can get a better burger. this place is empty as fuck for a reason. ITS SHITTY FOOD. we treated it as the place to go to when every other place was full.   i will now give kings wark credit in that if i were visiting scotland for the first time i would think it was awfully cute. it is authentic in a way that diner 7 could never be, though im increasingly hating the word authentic. if you are american and ever come to this place expecting anything like even an inside a mall diner, you will be severely dissapointed.   right next to this place there is a cute little gourmet food/wine shop. they have some serious cheeses and and wines. much better than diner 7. i would even eat at international starters across the street before this place, and that places gimmick is a restarant of appetizers at entree prices.   go to cameo next door instead for an atmosphere and a real burger. also, if you get the fries there (chips), go for melted cheese and peppercorn sauce.",

Relaxed atmosphere - very family friendly - and delicious burgers make for a fun time for the children and their accompanying grown ups. The menu isn't vast, but has everything you'd expect from a fast food burger joint that's probably the nearest we'll get to a real American diner.",
