So just accept the food is really incredible. In fact, it's more than food. It's art. Art you can eat. The very best kind of art. So instead of talking about the food, I'm going to talk about my experience of Restaurant Martin Wishart.  First off, it was my 21st when I went. A big occasion. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were treated like royalty. The waiters (all men, all French) were attentive but not intrusive. When they weren't needed they sort of lurked in the shadows, then appeared out of nowhere ready to assist.  We had the tasting menu with the matching wine menu to go with it, plus the supplementary cheese board coz we're greedy. Now it has to be said that this cost approximately the same as a small yacht, or 6 weeks in the Seychelles (that's hyperbole!), but it was really worth it. Our waiter talked us through all the wines, explaining why it matched. And when we'd finished they brought me a plate which had petit fours delicately arranged and 'Happy 21st Birthday' written in chocolate. A very, very special experience indeed.",

I don't think its possible to have anything that doesn't taste extraordinarily delicious. However this place is expensive, going back would be probably a few years from now :) But a friend of mine suggested this great App on the ipad called great british chefs thats has Martins recipes, so if I wanted to I could try to recreate some of the yumminess at home. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.greatbritishchefs.com%2F&s=eaa62bc9ef89101f7d6b8e2dfced5c46dbe641d7ef7961b944d3f91ad960f8d5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">greatbritishchefs.com</a>",

We had the tasting course and found it a pretty decent tastng menu.  There were about 2 stand out dishes like the soup and the rest were about a 7-8 which in our personal 1-10 rating is pretty respectable.  I would give this place about a 8 to 8.5 out of ten.

The atmosphere there is really good, and I can't commend it enough. Obviously the best thing about this place is the food, which is simply amazing. So well prepared, fantastically presented, with a really good wait time (quick compared to other 'posh' restaurants). You really can't beat the selection on the menu at Martin Wishar, and the prices aren't too bad either. The staff are also fantastic, which really leads me to recommend this restaurant. One of the best in Edinburgh!",

This ended up being the best meal we've had in 23 years. Hubby went with the 8 course menu that honestly had some things that scared me, so I went with the 6 course vegetarian menu instead. However, my fears were unfounded (he let me taste his). Snail ravioli, squab and even pig trotters were sublime. Between the 14 things between us, nothing was a miss- each was actually a revelation. Service was professional, though I did have to wait a bit longer than I may have expected for wine and bread, but taking in the whole experience in totality- it's a minor quibble and so still 5 stars. Plus, we had a lovely local couple next to us who eat there every year and we enjoyed our conversation immensely. It was just a fantastic evening.",

Not what you'd expect for a Michelin star restaurant. We know fine dining well and this sadly fell very short.   The good:  The staff were all very friendly! Had some great conversations.   The mushroom soup which was given to start was wonderful!   The Seaweed Butter and Sourdough bread were excellent  The Truffle Scallop Rissotto was divine!  The Moscato was magnificent   However,  Service: Time between service and even to receive menus was excessive. The dessert took a very long time we were told because our souffle fell. Hmmm  The shrimp and cabbage dish was very poorly done. Shrimp were rubbery :(  The best thing on the plate of duck with carrots, potatoes, and a creamed Swiss chard was the Swiss Chard. The potatoes were inedible. Extremely greasy!  One of the wine pairings burned your nostrils and tasted like kerosene.   The souffle itself lacked flavor and the apricot sauce they added made it worse.   When asked if he liked one of the items in particular our server replied \"not at all\". There you have it! A place whose staff doesn't like the food.   Sad :(. We actually included Edinburgh in our travel itinerary so we could dine here. Frankly expected more for the star, reputation, and nearly 300 pounds.",

I have been to The Kitchin & Castle Terrace and between the 3, this is by far the best.  I am not going into how all the food taste as we went for the tasting menu and there would be just too much of them to review and remember.  Unlike the other 2 Michelin starred restaurant that I have been to in Edinburgh, the food here was very consistent and the flavour and taste just exploded in your mouth with each and every course.  I will let the picture which I have taken speaks for itself.  How you imagine they would taste like from the picture, it was exactly how they tasted.  Let your imagination run wild.  Alternatively, if you have the money, please do come here for the tasting menu and you will absolutely not regret it.  I have been to the Gordon Ramsay Restaurant in London which is a 3 Michelin star and this place still trumps the Gordon Ramsay Restaurant.  I think this is a restaurant worthy of the next 2 Michelin stars.  Expensive but definitely a great experience.",

I must say, they have a well coordinated team, with superb professionalism from before you even enter the building. A well dressed gentleman in a suit was the first impression I received upon my entry. He quickly asked if he could stow my bags and coat and I was directly taken to my seat by a charming hostess.  I could go on about the tasty South African Cabernet I had. Or perhaps the fantastic delicacies, that were presented with absolute excellence. But I don't want to spoil the surprise. (Go for the 8 course. Refrain from eating all day, if you will, as it will fill you up.)  Every detail is payed very close attention to by each staff member.  If you leave to go use the washroom, your napkin is neatly folded and place on your table, ready for use again. If the food arrives in your absence, they cover it and standby until your return. Your water and wine will never be emtpy, (Also note, the glass and silverware here are of fine and high quality.  You can tell, just from drinking a glass of water.). You are always given a new set of appropriate silverware, with each new dish.  The staff here take delight in conversation with you and asking for feedback on the dishes.  This is definitively a restaurant of a higher class and caliber, so dress appropriately, because everyone here suits up. Very classy, very professional. Even though, I didn't show up in a suit, (I had slacks, a Ralph Lauren thin sweater, dress shoes, and a peacoat), I was not looked up at all with disdain, the way some of the other arrogant restaurants I have been into, back in America, if you weren't in a suit. No discrimination here. Just come here with an appreciation for fine wine and dining, and some good company, or not, and you'll have a memorable night in Edinburgh.  It was my first night in Edinburgh, Scotland, and I am so glad that this restaurant set the tone for the rest of my stay here.  I fully recommend this place to everyone. Make it a point to set reservations here. Every time I step foot in Edinburgh, I will have dinner here. They have respectfully earned my business with their service and food quality. I am a customer for the next few decades to come.",

The food was superlative and I also very much enjoyed that while service was certainly just about perfect (to me that means thorough, knowledgable but unintrusive), there was a warmth and lack of stuffiness to it that is wanting in many Michelin-starred restaurants and was quite refreshing.   We all very much enjoyed the chef's tasting with wine pairing and perhaps the best part came at the end when we all eagerly answered YES to whether we'd like cheese to finish our meal.   The server (who wasn't French, btw, so not all of them are...) came by with the cheese cart and went over the varieties. He was clearly someone who was not only very knowledgable but really seems to love what he does. The four of us decided with him to make two plates, one mild cheeses, one stinky cheeses and wow every one of them was just incredible and went beautifully with the Champagne we ordered to finish the meal with.

From the moment you walk in the door you know you are somewhere special. Greeted at the door we need not even give them our name, based on the time and without any notes in site he greets us both by name....!  With no hurry given to reviewing the menu we were instead given a beetroot macaroon with horseradish cream and asked if we wish to have an aperitif. Once that had arrived and we had begun to enjoy it and relax we were then presented with the menu, expertly explained by the waiter.  For me it had to be the tasting menu, other half went for the shellfish tasting menu. We both had the wine pairing. What happened next I don't have words for:  7 courses of the most exquisite cooking I have ever had the pleasure to witness. From the amuse bouche of 3 tasters including salsify, scallop and salmon mousse, to the scallop with pigs trotter puy lentils, duck with morels, ox tongue and potato.....it just kept coming! The wine with each course seemed to get better, some how not clahing against the last.  At the end of the meal we were privileged enough to be taken on a tour of the kitchen. If this is was michelin dining is about....I want more of it.  To say this place is JD Recommended is as big an understatement as can be made! :)",

Book in advance, sign up to their online newsletter as you actually get the odd 'deal' sent through. their cook school is also worth doing. Last minute offers to be had also.   I stand by my first review. If I could eat like this everyday oh boy would I!!!!",

    "text": "Surprised by the small amount of reviews?  This place in my opinion is the best of the Michelins in Edinburgh (and yes I have tried them all..) I feel like I could eat the food here every day, there is a lightness of touch in the preparation that really comes through when compared to it's ilk.  Recommending the set lunch, very good value at 27 for 3 courses. Thing about michelin places is the bread is always very good so you can stock up on that as they will never refuse you more (thrift recommendation #1)  Service is attentive but not stuffy even though the room is pretty formal. You can tell everyone involved here is really interested in good food from the lowest water pourer up to the head chef.  If you have the budget come and eat here. I would recommend getting a bottle of wine from a shop and drinking it on the picnic benches at the shore before you go in. The wine list is good but the markup is over 300% in places. Plus the water of leith can be nice on a good day. (Thrifty tip #2 - Edinburgh has no open container law so don't worry about kicking about with a bottle of wine).",

    "text": "This is one of the only Michelin Star Restaurant in Edinburgh. It's located off the beaten track (or in other words, down at Leith) and is something quite special to Edinburgh. I quite like getting in a taxi and going down to Leith, it almost feels as if I'm in a different city altogether!  The restaurant is funky, as my mum described it. It's nice, modern and clean, but maybe could do with a touch more excitement. But you don't go to a Michelin Star restaurant for the decor. The food was, as expected, delicious. The best part is there is always a good deal on to eat here, so you can get amazing food for next to nothing! I had lamb with vegetables in an orange sauce, which was YUMMY and my dad had steak, which he loved.   It's a brilliant place to come to for a special occasion!",
