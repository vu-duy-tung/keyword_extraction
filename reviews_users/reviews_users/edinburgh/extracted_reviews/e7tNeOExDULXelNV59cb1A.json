    "text": "Seems decent. I came in on a beautiful August afternoon with a pounding headache screaming for caffiene. I was desperate.   By chance I crossed this deli during the lunch rush and moseyed in for a coffee. There also seems to be a really good selection of freshly made sandwiches and treats but they weren't calling me that day, the caffiene hit was paramount.   So I ordered my latte and sat outside in a rare patch of sun. Service was friendly and ample seating outside. Coffee, it was good. Like I said, I was desperate.  Probably not going to be my go-to for coffee, but watching the others around me digging into their lunches makes me excited to come back to try the food next time. Watch this space for an update!",

    "text": "I have to admit, this little deli has never been on my radar. Sure, i've popped past it a few times but there has never been anything striking enough to get me through the door. In fact, if The Blue Bear hadn't been busy this weekend, I likely would kept it this way... and that would be a real shame.  I needed a small event catered. After a few unsuccessful calls to my go-tos in town, I found myself at The Blue Bear's door. However, they had a private party this weekend and were unable to bail me out. Ben & Jemma pointed me towards New Town Deli instead (another reason to love Cannonmills - they scratch the backs of their neighbours).  I popped in expecting the same runaround I had been given by the sandwich spots in town. I needed 16 sandwiches, mix of veggie and meat, for the next day.  No problem.  For an easily swallowed 40, I fed 15 people today. No mess. No fuss. The sandwiches were waiting when I arrived and got nods from everyone attending. They even gave me a call when I was running late to ask if I needed delivery. Shazam.  So I can't speak to the coffee or the regular fare, but if you find yourself needing to feed a bus full, it's a good place to start.",

    "text": "Before this date, I haven't really sampled anything from new town deli before.  So when Mum and I were passing and coffee popped into our head, we saw the opportunity to try it!  We ordered flat whites and they came nice and hot.  We also shared an almond croissant, which was a little dry but dipping it in one's flat white, helped.  Mum ordered filled rolls to take away.  I ordered a chicken, bacon and guacamole hot wrap to take away but it seemed to take at least 10 minutes to get onto the grill and toast.    The front service was fast and friendly, but not sure what was going on in the back as there was 2/3 of us waiting on something coming from the kitchen.  And to be fair it was a while.  The wrap wasn't as filled as I was hoping it would be.  It was kinda falling flat on what I was expecting.    If I'm passing, I'm sure I'll pop in for a flat white again but not for a wrap as I'm thinking 4 for a not so filled one is kinda expensive.  Maybe I'll opt for a different roll or sandwich!",

    "text": "There is a lot of sandwich places in the area but this one stands out. Better quality although it is also slightly more expensive than its neighbours.   There's a wide and varied selection of breads and fillings as well as a good selection of hot sandwiches (try the Cumberland sausage & mango chutney baguette; the club sandwich & fries is a favourite of many regulars) and burgers (the chicken burger with Mexican cheese, salsa, salad and fries is a Friday lunchtime treat).   The staff are very friendly and seem to have been here for year. They always have time to smile, say hi and chat.  The place is very light thanks to the large windows. Come rain or sun, I like to on one of the high chairs by the windows, have lunch & a Bundaberg ginger beer while watching the world go by Henderson Row. I love the big wooden table in the middle although it can be busy sometimes. There are a few tables outside for relaxing on a sunny day. The coffee here is good but there are 2 excellent coffee places round the corner but if you are looking to treat yourself to quick nice lunch in the area, then this is the place.",

    "text": "Good range of healthy, affordable salad boxes, panini, rolls and soup to take away. Salad boxes start at 3, and you can add more items for 25-50p. Although designed as a takeaway there are enough window (padded!) stools for a few people to sit in and it's quite spacious and lets you do some people watching. Service pleasant and efficient. Enjoyed the falafel and jalapeno salad (choose your own..) with a drizzle of balsamic. Only the panini are priced on the chalkboard but staff explain options well.",
