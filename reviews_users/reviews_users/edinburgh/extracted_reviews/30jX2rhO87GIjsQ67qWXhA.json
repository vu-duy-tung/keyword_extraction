    "text": "As far as burritos go, this was a good 'un.  The regular was generous on the portion size with ample filling. I went for coconut squash and It was well-seasoned; really full of flavour. So were the beans and the salsa. - It was a delicious burrito, and fairly inexpensive considering just how much it filled me up. I was in that awkward place when your after-work plans don't involve food but home is just a little too far to go home for something to eat. In the end, I was very glad of this, because I found a new burrito joint I can rely on.  I love that the veggie and vegan options here are that little bit more interesting. Coconut squash was delicious but the chipotle shredded tofu also sounded great.  The only negative I can think is that they aren't open late. But, that's no biggie. - I'm more than satisfied with dinner from Taco Mazama this time round!",

    "text": "Warning to snobs: this is NOT authentic Mexican.   Now that's out the way, they make decent tacos that most people seemed to eat just to refuel before going back for more shopping on Prince's St.   I had three tacos with the charbroiled chicken. The chicken was charbroiled but it wasn't seasoned nor did it have any distinct flavor. This is where many inauthentic eateries miss the mark, marinate your chicken. How else will my taste buds force me to remember your chain, absent of s distinct flavor?   They also use grocery store flour tortillas, authentic restaurants use homemade corn tortillas.   The winner here is the guacamole, which was surprisingly good. I took some of it home as well. They stock jarritos, too. All in all, not a bad place for a quick bite but don't expect much by way of taste.",

    "text": "Oh yeah!!! I had the soft tacos with the blue slush drink and it was every thing I ever dreamed of. Cute lil spot on Princes Street. They even offer vegan mac & cheese.  I tried it.  I'll be honest, I've had better.  But the tacos were yummy.  My friends have the burritos and everyone was pleased.",

    "text": "Taco Mazama is perfectly suitable for a burrito on the fly. I was looking for a quick fix whilst waiting for an engagement, and so as my bus stopped in front of the Taco Mazama location on Hanover street I trotted up to the doors and then inside--only to be told they were closed! Fine, no problem. Imagine my bewilderment moments later when I see another Taco Mazama, this one on Princes Street below street level with just a sign advertising its presence, except obviously open past 5pm. I wandered in, ready to take my burrito chances once more.  Put simply, Taco Mazama is fine. My burrito was 4.99 and pleasant enough, if a wee bit on the smaller side compared to the gargantuan fares you can get from Illegal Jack's and Los Cardos. I was intrigued by the other veggie options such as squash, but ended up going with my old standard, veggie haggis. When I asked for it the girl behind the counter without a word disappeared  seemingly into the floor only to appear about 5 minutes later from out of nowhere with veg haggis in hand. Burrito magic?!  I think what Taco Mazama didn't really provide for me was atmosphere. The tables (maybe three total) and chairs are all very cheap and no-nonsense. The burrito was about the same (and no black beans?? wahhh!), although it did fill the belly well enough. The furnishings and atmosphere left a lot to be desired, but like I said, if you're looking for a quick bite in a hurry you don't really need candlesticks and ambiance. At the end of the day I suppose if I was in a hurry I would consider going back to Taco Mazama, but when the alternatives (admittedly on the other ends of town) are so much nicer I don't know that I'd bother unless pressed for time.",
