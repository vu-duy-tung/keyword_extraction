Be it western, Indian, Chinese, fresh seafood, and so much more! It was great to try little bits of many things and then go back for seconds/thirds/fourths of the favorites. The staff was super friendly and we could easily take a new plate for every round, the previous one being cleared already when arriving back at the table. Come with a good appetite! On the back of the Cineworld movie tickets at the moment are -15% coupons, valid Monday-Thursday only. Normal cost of buffet to date is 16 pounds.",

I spoke with the manager when I paid the bill and she wasn't in the slightest bothered when I said it wasn't great and I wouldn't be back.",

    "text": "I have been so far mainly in Chinese (three) and Indian food (1) buffets, but never in a world cuisine one and I was intrigued! A friend of mine, big fun of meat dishes like myself, had already been there and he insisted on giving it a try at some point.   So there I was with some friends for the dinner buffet on a Thursday night (last week). We were taken to a table for two, drinks order was taken soon after we looked at the menu, and after a rather short introduction, off we went!!!  The cuisines include: Italian (i.e. pizzas), Indian (i.e. curries, naan bread etc.), Japanese (i.e. small selection of rolls/sushi), British (i.e. roast beef, and beef fillet steak cooked on the spot for you - MUST try , deliciously marinated, lamb chops were mentioned in the display but not available at the point), fresh sea food area cooked by a Chinese chef on the spot including baby octopus, mussels, prawns, salmon and cod I think. Additionally a variety of sides including salads, Parmesan cheese with pesto, egg fried rice and others.  And of course the desserts buffet: selection of cakes, panacota, brownie, a delicious creme brulee with coffee flavour (I had three of these!!! Small size, sorry, they were delicious), and also around six ice cream flavours including mint chocolate (recommended), and, the surprise of the night: Bubblegum flavour!!!! Wow, it brought back memories me being in primary school and having one bubblegum after the other to keep my taste buds happy!!!  Next time I think I'll try their lunch!! Well done guys!!",

The view of the \"----ome to Mr Basrais\" sign at the entrance made me wonder; if they don't care about its incomplete welcome board (which can be seen by everyone-see picture attached) how about the kitchen's state which cannot be seen by any of its patrons? Its promising \"theoretical\" main course menu offers a tempting assortment of international foods that includes Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Indian, Italian, Tex-Mex, British, American and European cuisine... but reality bites... Only 40% of the \"food stations\" had some food while the rest were just empty stainless steel pots... very shiny pots though...     I got a mix salad as a starter followed by a Lamb Bhuna portion with Pilau Rice and some bread which was tasty/adequate and after that a \"Dancing wok\" with some peppers, onions and some extra veggies (no meat was available to be added) plus a couple of pints of Cobra beer; probably the highlight of my meal (thanks Lord Bilimoria!!!) My mates also agreed about the un-remarkability of the whole culinary experience which was a real shame. The front of house lady was welcoming and polite and the floor crew mission was to deliver drinks and clear some plates as customer are self-serving themselves. Apparently they do have WiFi but as the waitress gave me the wrong password and didn't know the correct one I could not connect... by then it was 15:30 which is closing time so we needed to leave... not to return ever again...",

Add to this a good selection of desserts and friendly and polite staff, and you've got a winner. If you find Cosmo's a little bit too big, but or if you can't get in, go to Mr B's instead - it's better.",
