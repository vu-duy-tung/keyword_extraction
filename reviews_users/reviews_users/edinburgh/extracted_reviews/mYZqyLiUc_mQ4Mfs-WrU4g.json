    "text": "Yummy Korean comfort foods with nice staff. Sure, the decor and ambiance is lacking a bit, but with the delicious food at affordable prices, I still feel it deserves five stars.  My husband and I came here for dinner on s Thursday night. It was empty for people dining in, but during that time there were three delivery guys and one take out. We ordered the Korean pancake, spicy pork noodles and beef bulgogi bibimbap. The food was actually delicious! The place doesn't have much to the look but with high ratings, we were hopeful. The pork was tender and full of flavor. The portion sizes were appropriate and it didn't break the bank. I could imagine this be great for a lunch spot or even to take out.  Don't go here for the ambiance but go here for yummy comfort Korean food.",

    "text": "I'm well chuffed to have eaten at Kim's Bulgogi tonight after weeks of waiting for this place to open. I finally  got to feast on the the Korean inspired deliciousness that has since made by belly full and my heart so happy.   I think this is more a take out joint than a restaurant. There is limited seating but you can sit in, but fair warning- there is very little ambiance. Tonight, with the draught coming through from the door constantly opening and closing, my food was ice cold in minutes. It's also dead quiet and has a very cafeteria-like feel.   And that's totally fine, as long as the food it good.  And I'm happy to report it's REALLY good.   I ordered the soy sauce fried wings, sweet chilli fried wings, cucumber kimchi and vegetable dumplings to start. At around 1 for a serving, I'm thrilled. Even better it's all delicious. My new favourite is the sweet chilli wings which I'll probably just order about 10 servings of next Friday night to go with a night in.    Then the mains- a beef bibimbap for my partner and spicy pork for myself. Now if you're eating in, this place has no cutlery or crockery at the moment so it's all served in take-away ontainers. Definitely takes away from any authentic feel and that crispy rice bottom you'd expect from your bibimbap bowl is non-existent, but it's an enjoyable meal with vegetables to make you feel healthy.   I'm being kind because they're new. I'm hoping down the line the shop will be more welcoming and will serve their food in authentic bowls, but as a Korean takeout it's great.   And given the price, I can't complain too much. Two mains, a drink and four sides totalling 20, they'll definitely be seeing more of me.",
