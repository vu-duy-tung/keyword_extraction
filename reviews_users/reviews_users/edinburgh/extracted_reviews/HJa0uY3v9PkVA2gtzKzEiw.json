    "text": "On our last day in Edinburgh, we popped in here for a late lunch as it was within walking distance of our hotel. Our party of three, which included our 9-year old son, sat at street level, across from the bar.   We received a warm welcome, and were the only ones dining at that hour (it was around 3 p.m.). My husband had the hot brie, bacon and cranberry; I had a chicken Caesar salad with a side of onion rings; our son had the macaroni and cheese.   During our 2+-week trip, my husband tried several versions of the same sandwich and deemed Mercat's the best. It was on hearty brown bread, with copious amounts of filling. He who usually inhales his food savored every morsel of that sandwich, and washed it down with a local brew.  My Caesar was tasty, but drowning in too much dressing. A lighter hand with the dressing, and the salad would've been perfect. The chicken was perfectly cooked, and there was a generous amount of fresh Parmesan. The onion rings were perfectly cooked, and had a light, crispy batter. My beverage of choice was a pint of Strongbow.   The 9-year old's crock of mac 'n cheese was delish; however, it is made with a mature/sharp cheddar (which was a little too sharp for the little guy's palate). The crock of pasta and cheese had the appropriate amount of browned bits on top, and was tender and flavorful. The side salad came dressed in a raspberry vinaigrette, which helped cut through the richness of the mac 'n cheese.   Definitely will seek this place out the next time we're in Edinburgh.",

    "text": "Hotel concierge referred me to Mercat as I wanted something nice, but not super fancy after spending 12 hours on planes from LAX-LHR & LHR-EDI. Great little gastropub, with a variety of food choices for all palates.   I will add that this particular meal I was dining solo, and it was perfect. I opted for the Mac n Cheese, as I am like a moth to a flame when it's on a menu. And why wouldn't one get Max n Cheese in Edinburg? I opted for the regular and didn't add in the bacon. It was delicious. I also enjoyed it with a lovely Spanish Tempranillo, just because.  Additionally, the staff was very nice.",

    "text": "Edited for clarification.  Ok. WTH?  Our group was seated downstairs and then told to go back upstairs to the bar, even though there was a bar downstairs. Um, okay. As we were all wanting a drink and a few wanted something to eat, we didn't argue.  At the bar I spotted a sign hung on the wall listing \"classic cocktails.\" One of those was a martini. Easy peasy. \"I'd like a Grey Goose martini.\" I was met with a bartender who throw a menu at me with, \"Sorry, we can't do that. We can only make the drinks in the menu.\" Mind you, classic cocktails posted on the wall...but they won't make a Grey Goose martini because it's not in the menu. The young woman behind the bar made a face at me that expressed her discomfort in the male bartender's response to me, but she said nothing.  Ok, how about a Grey Goose martini without the vermouth? No.  Grey Goose on the rocks? Finally! So, I scoop out the ice because it was too much for the bartender to do himself.  What is so hard about helping a customer get what they want? A simple classic cocktail is too much? A classic martini is only two ingredients!  Two members of our group ordered food. One couldn't eat her Caesar salad as the dressing was nothing but mayonnaise. The other had her food delivered cold and greasy. Yuck!  The group decided to leave after 20 minutes. The staff were pretty rude and not interested in providing customer service. The food was not worth the money. Even though they had fewer than 10 customers on the ground floor, the wait staff couldn't handle 8 more.  Evening if you offered to pay, I wouldn't go back.",

Stopped in the previous night at 8:00pm and they had closed the kitchen because it was slow, liked the looks of the menu so we wanted to give it another try. The food quality was great and Liam and Lydia were very attentive servers. My wife had the Mac N Cheese and I had the sirloin. But we're very good.",
