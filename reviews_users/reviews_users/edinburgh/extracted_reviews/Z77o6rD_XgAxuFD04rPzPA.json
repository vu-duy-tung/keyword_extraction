The broth was so flavorful, I suspect it had Parmesan rind in it to make it so good. Had the number three with aubergine and sundries tomato on ciabatta and it was just as lovely.",

The sandwich prices are more than affordable and it's a very no-frills place to stop and grab a quick lunch. Note that dining in does cost an extra 20% tacked onto your bill. It's bar seating and first-come, first-served. Service is very friendly and quick!",

I love little unprentious places like this that sell food that feels authentic, uses fresh, interesting ingredients and where there feels like a lot of choice. Imagine it's popular for lunch on the go but I was there early evening when the artichoke, olive and sundried tomato ciabatta and coffee were just what I needed waiting for the torchlight procession to start.",
