    "text": "Sigh. Birthplace of Harry Potter..... using this as the only tag-line to draw people in I was pretty safe in the assumption i was going to hate it. And don't I love it when I am right.  A chum of mine who studies english literature and is a complete potter-nutter came through to visit me on my first week in Edinburgh and she was pretty keen to give this a go. Knowing that I hated it I smiled and nodded hoping it wouldn't be too cliche, and that they might at least have some good coffee.   Once we arrived it didn't seem too potter-mad, and we joined what was a reasonable sized queue for what felt like forever!?!? They had several members of staff but only the ONE taking orders, making drinks, plating up cakes, and doing the till. Hence, a very long wait. Once we had finally been served I ordered a cappuccino and a piece of carrot cake. We then found ourselves some seats near the front. This is another thing I do not like - had it been anywhere else I would have ordered and got my friend to grab some seats. But no not here, this is not 'allowed'...... well I don't want to end up buying your poor coffee and average cake to find I have nowhere to sit!? Surely I deserve that at least.  The rant continues - the toilets- SORT THEM OUT. They are covered in graffiti about how harry potter has changed lives....... yawn. Its a book, and to be honest it just makes the toilets seem filthy. Even my over excited friend said, and I quote - that's just weird. Even I love Harry Potter, but that is just too far. Think it sums it all up pretty nicely.",

Such a pity, as it's a lovely place inside and would be nice to sit in. But why bother giving them business with such an attitude?",

Best of all, all of this stuff cost only 11 pounds.  Not bad at all.  Inside they have a lot of articles about the coffee house in general and about JK Rowling.  It's such a cool - can't miss - place if you ever visit Edinburough.  The staff is very nice, friendly and helpful.  It reminds me of a place in Berkeley - kind of hippyish.  I can see why JK spent so much time there.",

Not great, but okay.The food doesn't suck, but it's not all that great, either, especially at those prices.   Things that'd make the experience better: 1. Coffee that's actually hot, instead of lukewarm 2. Dressing on the salad instead of dry greens, or at least other options for sides instead of a dry salad 3. Lower prices.   If you go, go because you're a Harry Potter fan or because you like the view of the castle. That way, you're getting a little more for your money because you're getting a tourist attraction as well as something to eat. If you go just because you're wandering around Edinburgh in search of a bite to eat, move on. You can do a lot better.",

It was quick and easy and also delicious with great atmosphere. It was very packed every time we went so you just have to be prepared for that but there were people there to seat you. I had a delicious brie and ham sandwich both times and then tried many of the different desserts. The Victoria sponge was amazing as was the cranberry bar. My coffee was made very well and was delicious. The bathroom is a must see. Also look in the drawers of the miss matched tables-there are many notes and secrets kept in there. This place was so absolutely charming and once again the view is unbeatable. I am a huge Harry Potter fanatic so this was kind of a mecca for me, but it is also a very charming and delicious cafe for the non-Harry Potter obsessed person. We found all of the employees to be helpful as well as really nice.",

It attracts hoards or tourists who might not wander this far from the Mile otherwise, who then mix with (and it doesn't always work out for the best) with locals who want to catch up with friends or a central meeting spot.  Because they can rely on a steady stream of trade, the service standards aren't the best and they can get away with the food and drinks being fairly average. The Stromboli we had was quite bland and the chai lattes with treated ourselves were, well, not a treat after all.  Still, it's a busy little spot to rest in, with great views of the castle, but there are better places nearby which don't rely on selling themselves out for business.",

I love Chicken Tikka Masala, so throw that on top of a baked potato on a chilly day, along with a cup of tea and I'm the happiest person that can be.   My sister and I weren't super impressed with the quality of the hot drinks - she had a mocha that people had recommended but said it was really only so-so. I had an espresso affogato which was pretty good, but not amazing. When we came another day, we had the Scottish Breakfast Blend - a house specialty, and that was quite tasty. So I would definitely recommend the tea over the coffee drinks.  The prices are decent and the service pretty okay, so overall, a nice place to relax in the afternoon. I can definitely see how J.K. Rowling found this to be the perfect creative environment to write Harry Potter.",

The place is very nice inside with a warm decor which as has already been stated with a running theme of elephant influenced decor. The seating area at the back is pretty small to be honest, especially for it catering to the many thousands of tourists who flock to this place every year.  Each time I have come here I have had the hot chocolate, every time it has been brilliant. However, every time I have had to wait quite a long time for it, due to its fame, the Elephant House always has queues and is extremely busy. A far cry I would imagine from before the Harry Potter craze.  Worth a visit, but be patient and watch out for the tourists!",

Lots of them.  Elephant House rams their tenuous link to the world's most miserable billionaire down our throats at every turn, and to be honest it doesn't seem to me that they have much else up their sleeve. It looks a lot nicer from the outside than it does when you actually go in, and the standard of grub is far closer to school canteen levels than the fairly hefty price tags would suggest.  It does seem that the owners charge some sort of supplement for their customers to have the priviledge of sitting on the same seats that the loathsome old cow did in the late 90s. My slice of rocky road was tasty, but not enough so to merit the 50% price hike compared to other cafes nearby.  Nothing special, and a bit irritating.",

I agree with many of the other reviewers, unless you're really really into Harry Potter then give this place a miss, everything about it is standard... apart from the prices which are extortionate.

I dread to think how many photographs exist of me mid-bite from my short lunch stay in The Elephant House. Because this isn't just any cafe; it's the birthplace of Harry Potter. And people love Harry Potter. Also, there's loads of elephants dotted around.  For a cafe with such novelty factor, lunch was pretty good. The panini's were fresh and tasty and service was friendly and fast. For the cost, I'm sure there were more interesting lunches in the vicinity, but lunch was really enjoyable and filling. - Perfect for our break before we got back to some busking in the centre.  There's Elephant House memoribilia for sale. Although, I'm not sure if they celebrate elephants or HP, or both. On the gimmick scale, Elephant House ranks highly because it's torn between its elephant-adoring roots and its facilitating of the Harry Potter creation.   The ladies' loos are a really fun place, with literally every surface covered in Harry Potter quotes and fun scrawls. I enjoyed Elephant House this time, but I can't imagine it'd become a regular haunt of mine. Still, a solid lunch!",

The menu isn't too overwhelming and has a good variety in terms of food and drinks. The hot chocolate is worth trying to grab a table and relax with as the drink warms you up.

Secondly, as a writer who has both had her fair share and more of espresso in cafes from Vancouver to Reykjavik to Helsinki, it failed on the writerly front as well.   Use the washroom, take your photos, and go to Cafe Nero or even Starbucks. My soya flat white was literally steamed soya milk, and barely filled half of the cup. They gave me a faulty lid, and I promptly spilt the cup down my down jacket. I asked for another and they refused, handing me a lid and a sour face of uncaring emptiness.

We ordered our food at the counter and were then seated in the back - not right at the window, but at a table with a decent view of Hogwarts - I mean Edinburgh Castle. ;)  Hubby & I split the soup of the day - Spicy Homemade Meatball. This was our favorite thing we ate all day! YUMMERS. Spicy & hot & delicious & perfect for a cold day exploring the city. The bread that came with it was nothing spectacular. We also split the special BBQ Chicken Panini and Lamb & Mint Pie with gravy & mashed potatoes. The panini was good - but nothing spectacular or special - and the lamb pie was hot with a delicious crust. Basically everything you expect a lamb pie to be.  I can see why JKR sat here. The coffees are under 2 pounds and it's cozy with, obviously, amazing views.  Be sure to check out the bathrooms, which have been covered in graffiti exulting the wonders of Harry Potter.",

The food was standard for a cafe though the portions were not big enough for the money.   What disappointed me most was the low level of service; no smile; no wifi in 2015; no flexibility for my friend with vegan options; a feeling of being an inconvenience when placing our order.    Plus the use of the 'Harry Potter' label to push cheaply made, overpriced gimmick gifts detracts from what could be genuine charm on account of the elephant theme and views from the back out to the cityscape.",

    "text": "Yep, the birthplace of Harry Potter, JK Rowling spent time in this cafe writing her first HP novel. It overlooks the cemetery in the back, with a view of a prep school which inspired Hogwarts.  There is also an old writing desk with a few drawers on the side - apparently if you pop it open, there will be paper and a pen for you to write. Some cool tidbits there, but as famous as this cafe got, I don't think the food was good though the space in the back is really nice.   I ordered a mallow delight, which was \"hot chocolate with a marshmallow cream\".  I guess I got that, but for 3.50, it was 3 packs of instant hot chocolate (Cadbury?) and marshmallows and topped with whipped cream. It was 1.50 more expensive than the regular, and incredibly sweet.   I also ordered the coconut blueberry cake, which I thought was dry, and I guess it was my slice probably but it didn't have any blueberries. I had to ask what it was, since I wasn't sure if it was a square sheet cake, or a brownie, or a bar. I kept getting the reply \"uh it's coconut and blueberry..\".  I can read, but is it a cake? A bar?  Anyway I thought my snack was a bit on the expensive side for something that didn't taste very good. I also felt silly paying 3.50 for packaged hot chocolate - at least put it in a fancy looking can so I think its something a bit nicer!    Maybe the other food is better, but I'm not really inclined to come back here to figure it out!",

However, the atmosphere was relaxed and perfect for a cup of tea or a casual meal. It also wasn't to crowded in the evening and night time in which we went.  The orders: 1) veggie nachos - I felt their was too much chilli for the nachos but the portion was very large for one person and it was overall good. My friend got the smoked salmon and that was wonderful. 2) tea and apple pie - can't go wrong here just came here after a long second day in Edinburgh  3) haggis meal! - better then the haggis I got in a previous restaurant and the mast potatoes were amazing",

    "text": "Hm...what to say.   Well first off, it was very cool to be in a place that acted as a source of inspiration for such a wonderful writer. Personally, I'm not actually a \"Potterhead\". I more align with the \"Twihards\". But as a bookworm, I have absolute respect for both the series and the author, and so this spot was a no-brainer for our itinerary.   In terms of ambience, it's pretty packed at all hours of the day. We went for dinner, and though we didn't have to wait to be seated, the seating itself was in close quarters. There were tons of people, and that made for a very loud setting. There's a lot of Rowling memorabilia on the walls, and the bathrooms are absolutely filled with what I have coined \"Potterhead Love Notes\". I did not partake in the graffiti, but I can imagine that for a Potter Lover, this would be an awesome experience.   In my opinion, the food was delicious. But there were a couple others in my party that disagreed. Their menu is a little eclectic. I was more expecting...I don't know, whatever a cafe in Scotland would normally serve? But as you'll see with what we ordered, they had foods from many cultures.   I ordered the Tomato Bruschetta, the Soup of the Day which turned out to be Zucchini and Lentil, and the Elephant Treat for a drink. I loved them all. The bruschetta was fresh and refreshing. For any Americans traveling through the area, Scotland has very heavy food, as you might have noticed. So the light snack was really refreshing. The soup was also delicious. Very thick, and tasted almost like a zucchini chili - if that makes sense at all. And the drink was YUM. A perfect hot tottie after walking through the chilly Scottish weather for eight hours.   The Elephant Nachos were ordered as an appetizer to share. If you follow my reviews, you know that I'm originally from Southern California. I mention that because as Californians, we were quite impressed with the nachos. They were amazing. Very simple, but very tasty. And cheesy - which is the best part. And the guacamole was authentic!   The couple of people in my party that didn't enjoy their meals were the ones that ordered the lasagnas. They all agreed that it was much too cheesy and thick. None of them could finish even half of their portions because of the richness. Perhaps that's just our American tastes getting in the way, but if you don't enjoy heavy, rich food, this might not be the best option for you.   Speaking of portions - they're huge! We definitely over-ordered. I even tried to order small, but couldn't finish either of the options.   A Mocha and a Vanilla Latte were also ordered during the visit. Both were delicious, but I liked the latte best.   And finally, the service was decent. Since it was so busy, everyone was a bit preoccupied so there were moments in which we needed things but had no one to ask them for. But other than that, they were attentive when they could be, and that was much appreciated.   Definitely a cool experience. I'm sure this would be an amazing occasion for Harry Potter obsessed fans. I deem this an Edinburgh Must-Go.   Happy feasting!",

    "text": "This afternoon I stopped by The Elephant House for a snack.  I had been looking forward to eating here since my trip to Scotland last year.  The expectation was far more satisfying than the reality.  It was sort of like being asked out by the most popular boy from your high school at your twenty-year reunion only to find out that he still works at the same movie theater and lives in his parent's basement.  From the moment I walked in, I felt unwelcome.  The hostess who sat me acted as if she were doing me a favor by letting me dine in her establishment.  As the restaurant was not particularly busy, I asked for a seat by the window.  Since I was by myself, the hostess insisted in seating me as far from the window as possible, in the middle of a through way.  After the third time one of the wait staff bumped into me, I moved to the other side of the table.  Almost immediately a mother and daughter were sat next to me, effectively boxing me into a corner where the only way out was to crawl under the table or scale the lady next to me.  I'm not sure why they were sat next to me when over half of the tables in the room were empty-- including several by the windows.    I ordered a glass of red wine and bowl of mixed olives.  A young waiter apologetically informed me that they only had black olives.  Very polite and personable, my brief interaction with him was the highlight of my entire experience.  My bill was brought before my food and drinks were delivered.  When the olives arrived, they looked as if someone had opened a jar of supermarket sliced olives, poured a bit of oil on them, and sprinkled a few herbs-- they tasted that way, as well.  Waxy and flavorless, don't waste your hard earned pounds on these.  The wine was substandard and overpriced.  I only managed a few sips before giving up.  The best part of my snack was the bottle of sparkling water that I could have purchased at the corner market for a fraction of the price.  When I enquired about paying my check, I was directed back to the front of the restaurant where I waited a good amount of time until someone came to the till.        Final Thoughts:  The view of Greyfriar's Cemetery and Edinburgh Castle from the back room is gorgeous.  If you can get a seat near the window, it would be worth the price of a cup of tea or a cappuccino.  If your goal is to writing the great Amer . . . er . . . Scottish novel, this is probably not the best place.  No WiFi (paid or free) and if you linger, you are unceremoniously glared at until you vacate your table.  Next-door at Patisserie Valerie or The Library Bar on the University of Edinburgh campus would be much better choices.",

    "text": "Okay. Right, so here's something you need to know about me. I am a little tiny bit of a Harry Potter nerd. In school, I was \"the Potter girl\" for a reasonably long time. Therefore, as you can imagine, coming here is a bit of a sentimental thing.   That being said, I still have some criticisms. Firstly, well, it's too warm in here! Edinburgh outside was cold and I nearly fainted because it was so hot. The menu isn't signposted very well which is disappointing especially as you spend enough time in the queue waiting to order. On that note - you stand in the queue, remember to grab any cold drinks from the fridge if you want them then, then you order, get given your little tray with a bottle and a number, you walk into the dining area where a member of staff then seats you. The table turnover time is pretty spectacular, I thought we would never be able to get a seat (we did). Now back to the menu - if they'd display it better I don't think there'd be so much waiting because there's a menu at the till for you to peruse and decide on food.  There's a counter which has some incredible home-baked goods on display - sweet and savoury and the quiches looked fantastic.  We however decided to get the Haggis (plus neeps and tatties for 8.50), the beef lasagne (7.50) both a cold drink (Irn Bru and a diet coke) as well as two brownies.   We sat down, and chatted. Now, go to the bathrooms. I'm not kidding. I could have spent a good hour in here reading all the comments and quotes that HP fans scrawled over, well, everything. It makes my heart glow. All I wanted to do after washing my hands was head home to reread the series. But that's just me.   The food arrived, and you know, it was fine. It wasn't the best lasagne I've ever had, it wasn't the best haggis I've ever tried. The bread that came with the lasagne was a little out of place and the salad was a little lackluster.  The brownie on the other hand - hollaaaa, it was AMAZING. It was perfection. Sweet, chocolatey, dense but light and crispy and doughy and moist (ew what a horrible word).   If you don't mind being run down by tourists and probably overheating, and you do want a good brownie or some decent food, this is where you should come. Especially if you ever wanted to go to Hogwarts as well. One thing to note however, there is no wifi here. At all. \"Pretend it's 1995 and talk to one another\".",

    "text": "Since I am a huge Harry Potter fan, of course I had to go to this place, even if it was just to take a picture at the door.  I had read some reviews of the cafe saying that it wasn't as good as one might expect, so I avoided going there. But one day it was raining a lot and my friend and I wanted a cup of coffee, so we decided to give it a go.  We waited the queue by the counter (where you can buy badges, postcards with elephants and other elephant-inspired souvenirs), ordered our food and then headed inside to be directed to a table.  The waitress that took my order looked very upset, and it made me feel uncomfortable. I noticed none of the staff was smiling. I understand the place is very busy, but at least they could try to be a bit friendlier. Most people who go to the cafe are foreign people who maybe aren't sure of how to pronounce some words, and if the staff is impatient, it makes them feel insecure. I had a slice of Nutella cake and a mocha, and my friend had tea and a biscuit. I feel we paid too much for what it actually was. Sure, the cake was tasty and the coffee was good, but the portions were too small.   The coolest thing about the place is the bathroom. The walls are completely covered in writing from Harry Potter fans all over the world, thanking J.K. Rowling and quoting bits from the books and movies. I liked that a lot, but I was expecting some more Harry Potter/ Rowling inspired stuff.",

We attempted to come here three different times, twice their card machine was out and they were only taking cash. Third time was supposed to be the charm.   It was incredibly disappointing. The food, service and decor were mediocre at best, and the castle was obscured by trees and poor positioning of tables. This place has so much potential and they aren't taking advantage of it. There are way to many tables and chairs, making the place feel crowded. I can't imagine a writer coming here to get much work done. You get the sense the place is all tourists and no locals.",

The atmosphere is quite lovely. There's a small area up front with seating, but also a large and open space in the back with high ceilings, more seating including some sofas, and plenty of elephant decorations. The girl's bathroom is amazing since it is literally a shrine to Harry Potter, which every single surface (walls, mirrors, soap dispensers) covered in words and scribbles dedicated to HP. The boys' bathroom is not nearly as graffiti'ied...sorry lads. They've also got some interesting HP/J.K. Rowling articles and drawings on one wall.  The food at this cafe is mediocre. Fills you up, but nothing particularly flavorful. My vegetarian chili and my friend's steak pie was decent. My other friend mostly liked the pulled pork focaccia. The coffee and tea drinks were better though and worth trying.",

We were lucky, we came during off season, so we able to get in and sit in the backroom with window overlooking the Edinburgh Castle.  JK Rowling often came here and sat in the backroom to save on the heating bill and rumor has it, she had Edinburgh Castle in mind when she wrote about Hogwarts. The view was so dreamy in a cloudy day, unbelievable and amazing view!  We bought some souvenir from here and took a lot of pictures, check the bathroom too if you here.

We had a wait time of over 10 minutes even though we could see several clean tables. The waitress, working in a tea shop, didn't know what Earl Grey was. An extra item also was added to our bill. They removed it fairly quickly, but it took forever to get the bill in the first place. They also messed up the order. Very cool bathroom with tons of Harry Potter graffiti Decour.

I was pleasantly surprised as I really didn't expect anything too impressive coffee-wise, mainly because of the touristy nature of the place.   Boy was I wrong. It's lovely, and cozy, and good for conversations that last for hours, and, yes, on a rainy afternoon I fully understand why half of Edinburgh wants to hide within these four walls.

    "text": "Last week I decided to drive up to Edinburgh for a mini holiday and thought to check this place out. I actually did not know about this cafe and it's history until I discovered it through an Instagram profile. I was searching hashtags of cappuccinos and a delicious looking one popped up and the title said \"Birthplace of Harry Potter\" which drew me in right away because I am a big fan of the book series. I walked from my hotel to the Cafe and right when I saw it, I knew I would enjoy the view because it was located on George IV bridge which overlooked a good portion of the city including Edinburgh Castle! The front of the Cafe is painted in this nice blood red color and there is a poster of JK Rowling in the window which draws you. It looks very small when you first enter and you worry if they are going to have room for you as there are only a few stools/chairs for window seating. However, as you get close to the counter you realize that there is a much larger seating area in the back of the cafe. The Elephant House differs from a lot of cafe's in that you have to wait in line to be served at the counter and then wait to be seated, rather than taking your seat and ordering from there.  The menu was full of cute British and Scottish foods/pastries and a set of coffee drinks as well. I opted for the special of the day which was a lovely fresh mint tea and a slice of the homemade organic carrot cake. After paying things got a little tricky because the place was PACKED! The front of the cafe is first come first sit type of seating but the back room where JK Rowling sat and wrote the first few Harry Potter novels is assigned seating by a hostess. It seemed really crazy because we had no where to place our tray and had to stand holding it in that hectic crowded area while waiting to be seated. After 2 minutes we were seated with another group, which made me a bit awkward but quickly that faded because I wanted to relish in the ambiance of the room, the HARRY POTTER WRITING ROOM as I called it :). It was a nice back room, not a lot tables so many people shared with other customers they did not know. A lot of writers sitting on laptops or writing on pieces of paper for inspiration which I thought was really cute. The best part was the view from the back windows. Perfect panoramic view of the city and Edinburgh Castle. Was it a coincidence that Hogwarts looks EXACTLY like Edinburgh Castle? I think not! The mint tea was lovely and fresh and the cake was sweet but not too sweet and had amazing frosting. I decided to take a quick break to the bathroom where I was extremely surprised by the white walls covered in writing with notes from fans all over the world thanking JK Rowling and complimenting the books. I really enjoyed the whole experience except for seating situation and being forced to share a table with others who didn't seem too keen to be sitting with us either, but that quickly vanished after a few minutes. Great experience, good food and environment.",

Interesting cakes (lavender, anyone?) and more always make for a pleasant stop along the typical walking tour of the area.",

In short: 1) great food (kinda important); 2) nice decor - there are elephants EVERYWHERE; 3) nice atmosphere - a mix of both locals and tourists; and 4) great history (someone penned the small art-house book series about a boy wizard here).  The price is right too and the food was good...I mentioned the food right?  Whilst the staff were nice I felt that they were understaffed and that this kinda spoilt things a little. This should not be taken to mean that the staff there were not doing their job properlly - this place was busy and the staff were like Scottish versions of Road Runner....keep up the good work guys....Beep Beep.  Okay that wasn't really a short review but I can be long winded.",

    "text": "Once upon a time, Ian Rankin, JK Rowling and Alexander McCall Smith used to go to The Elephant House to sit and write over endless cups of coffee. Lord knows what any of them would think if they went back for an espresso or latte now.   Aside from the terrible service and permanently stressed looking staff, the place is so darn busy it's difficult to get a table. Spring to summer especially, the cafe is jam-packed with tourists desperate to secure a seat with views of the Castle. To make it worse, there's merchandise everywhere you look, the music is insipid and there's a live webcam opening til closing time so strangers across the world can watch as you eat your lunch!   The biggest disappointment however, has to be the food and drink. On paper, soup, panninis, pitta, quiche and baked potatoes sounds quite promising but I suspect from tasting the last two that everything is part cooked in advance then microwaved. The coffee I ordered was equally bland and frothy.   Free Wi-Fi or not, The Elephant House are going to have to raise their game if they want to inspire a new generation of writers!",

    "text": "The way some people talk about The Elephant House you would think it was going to lead us to the promised land. I have never really understood the delirium. For a start I'm not going to mention the \"HP\" word (clue: I'm not talking about the sauce).  The Elephant House does have some appeal. Yes its central location and large space are appealing, but that's somewhat negated if you can never find a seat and it takes half a day to ques. Yes its late opening hours are a great idea in a city where the only place you can go after 8pm is the pub or bed, but whats the appeal if your only option is overpriced coffee (which you probably still have to que for). Yes it seemingly has a good range of lunchtime snacks, but that's not much good if the portions are so small you question the fact you just ordered a meal, and so overpriced you need to get a second job to make up for it.  Maybe I've just been unlucky, maybe it's because of all the hype it was easy to feel let down. But i have always found The Elephant House to be offer pricey small portions of average food. It's fine if you can avoid the crowds but otherwise there are plenty of alternatives nearby.",

    "text": "I realised, after my last review, that I've still never reviewed the Elephant House. I'm not sure how as I bring most people here when they're visiting me.  \"Do you really?\" I can hear you thinking. \"But you've given it three stars!\" Well, yes. As a cafe, it's not so hot. It's kind of expensive, although it's a lovely space. The service is as quick as it can be, given that it's almost always heaving in here with tourists wondering which table J K Rowling used to sit at. The cakes are fine. The hot chocolate is fine. It's just a nice place.  It's funny, but when you're inside you wouldn't necessarily know this was \"the place\". The theme is, fittingly, elephants. There are elephants everywhere. It's quite sweet. People don't come for the elephants, though. They come for the magic.  The Elephant House, you see, touts itself as The Birthplace Of Harry Potter. Everyone knows the tale - that Jo Rowling, a penniless single mother, used to spend hours in an Edinburgh cafe, writing the book about a boy wizard that would, once published, lift her almost overnight to international literary superstardom. Well, the Elephant House, like many other establishments in Edinburgh, claims to be that cafe. Unlike many other establishments, however, here people have bought into the story. The tourists are fully invested in it. You can see how, gazing out of the large window at the back directly onto the majestic crags of the castle, someone might conceive the notion of Hogwarts. On the website, there's even an interview with the writer from shortly before the publication of the second book, filmed at the cafe (which incidentally is worth a watch because it's endearing how thrilled she is with sales that now pale in comparison to current figures).   Now, I don't want to get into a discussion on the nature of truth; this is a cafe review. BUT - whether or not it's True that she actually wrote there is, I think, not important. What's important is that everyone believes it. It's got a kind of truth of its own. Which leads me on to why I bring everyone here for a quick cup of tea, despite the big crowds, the big prices, the fact that while the food is pleasant there are many other places doing much nicer stuff nearby...  The toilets. You have to go into the toilets.  Obviously, I don't know what the men's loo is like, but if it's like the ladies', then it's a strangely uplifting experience. The walls are covered in graffiti: scribbled letters of gratitude, love and affection to the writer who changed the world and to the characters who are so real to so many. There are silly references, in-jokes about in-jokes, sketchy doodles and deeply heartfelt missives of appreciation, and never has finding words of love written on the wall of a public toilet been so innocent and so beautiful. Hogwarts might be fictional, but the magic here is real.",

I've enjoyed its chicken salad, and its pizza is pretty decent. The nachos are always a must for my friends and I. The price is slightly above average for a poor scholar but it's worth it as the portions are big enough to share.  I can see why it's a lovely place to write in...

I do believe that many people visit it because of the quality of what is offered, rather than purely because someone (supposedly) wrote some books there.  I've been here a few times now, and have enjoyed each one.  It does tend to be busy, especially in the summer with all the tourists, but come in the winter during term time, and it's the perfect hideaway for that last minute essay-writing session.  I think that coming into this place without knowledge of the wizard-based hype is the best thing to do.  The food is fairly standard cafe-bistro style, and has always satisfied me in quenching hunger.  This place enjoys a great view of the castle from an assortment of different tables in the back area, with a few tables near the main servery at the front.  I'm pleased that The Elephant House has stuck to its roots, with lots of elephant-based things.  I wouldn't have wanted it to turn into some big Harry Potter shrine, as that would ruin what is a lovely little cafe.  I hope that they keep it this way.  I think if it changed, I would stop going.",

A tapas style board arrived with olives, tortilla and mediterrean veggies - yum and all gluten free (if the bread is not added to it). A great range of cakes is available and I was impressed there were around 5 choices of proper gluten free cake (Victoria sponge, almond cake, chocolate cakes), and not just the usual chocolate brownies.  For locals wanting to try it, I suspect a non busy time such as late afternoon mid-week would mitigate some of the issues mentioned in previous reviews but I have already recommended The Elephant House to other friends.",

But let's face it, you can see the castle from most parts of the city centre, and to be honest your chances of getting anywhere near that particular table are slim to none anyway.  Aside from the gimmicks, it's just another coffee place that serves soups/sandwiches/cakes etc. Except it's not even a particularly good one. The way you carry your tray away from the till down the long, narrow room to try and find the last available table whilst getting stared at by all the other smug-looking people already sat down, will make you feel like you're back at school again. Except at school, you didn't pay around 8 for an ok-ish sandwich and a cup of tea.  If you judge a place based on how busy it is, then there aren't enough stars in the world to award this place. But unfortunately it's not just can't-find-table-anywhere busy, it's also the staff who are rushing round like lunatics and they certainly don't move out of the way for you... even with your huge school dinner tray.",

Turns out the tea is not so gourmet. The filters that came with the tea were filthy and hadn't been washed (see photo). There were no sweetener options (which is surprising for gourmet) other than a wide-mouth container on the table that you have to dive your spoon into and  given the cleanliness of their filters, I can only imagine how unhygienic the sugar bowls are.  Overall, this place was a great disappointment and clearly relies on their connection to a famous author to stay in business.",

It took about 15 minutes for someone to take our order which we understood.  They were packed and we weren't in a rush.    We decided to try haggis for our first time at this place and so glad we did!  It was good paired with the mashed potatoes and turnips.  We got the chicken pot pie as well with a coffee (even though it was scorching in there!)  They have a few souvenirs you can buy which is fun and nice.  I did buy a medium ladies shirt and it runs small.  Just please be careful if you buy a t-shirt - they are smaller than what we are use to in the states.  Unfortunately, I washed it and dried it on medium heat before I wore it and shrunk it more, so it may be my 10 year old nieces present from Scotland now.  Great place to visit if you get the chance!",

I ordered a cup of tea (turns out I ordered a small pot) so I could sit and take in the cafe. It's filled with elephant artwork (hence the name) and plenty of places to sit. There are great views of Edinburgh castle if you sit near the window.   My tea was good and staff was friendly. Just mind the crowds.",

I mean, I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to geek out a bit on whatever Rowling-inspired nonsense they had inside, but what made us step inside were the drinks and the sweets.  We're kind of simple like that.  The first thing I noticed about the cafe was that it was packed. The second was that it was bloody hot in there!  They had two girls working the register and making drinks, but for some reason, the line stalled. Once we got to the front, we placed our orders (chai tea and a brownie for me, large latte and an apricot granola bar for him) and waited while they prepared the drinks.  After paying, we turned towards the dining room and waited to be directed to a table (which I'm guessing they do to stem the tide of people). We were given a booth at the front of the restaurant, which, despite the number of pillows on the bench, was kind of unwelcoming. I think a number of bottoms over the years have smooshed the softness out of the pillows.  Still, it was nice to relax a bit, especially after having just run 10 miles during the Great Edinburgh Run. The drinks were very good, and the sweets hit the spot.  There wasn't nearly as much Rowling-inspired nonsense inside as I thought there'd be, but I did manage to find a collage of pictures and such. And apparently the bathroom walls are covered with notes to the author, should she ever go back. I can't speak to that personally, because I did not go in, but I glimpsed the walls when the door opened, and they definitely were covered in writing. I get my information from the Harry Potter Trail guide.  This is a nice place to while away a few hours in the afternoon, over a nice warm cup and a tasty little treat. Prices seemed to be fair, as well.",

I ordered soup of the day, which ran out, so I decided to get the replacement soup, it happens. My husband ordered the goat cheese pizza which he did enjoy. We sat at the bar so we did have a view of the kitchen, and watched someone pick up our food to bring it over, and then put it back down a few minutes, not sure why. Maybe she realized we didn't have our coffees yet? If we hadn't felt like we had invested so much time waiting we probably would have left.",

    "text": "Location:  First off- if your Harry Potter fan, this is a must. You would be glad to know that this place is pretty easy to spot, and very close to the graveyard where J. K. Rowling was inspired to name some of her characters in her novels. If you want to stay here and eat, just get a pastry and a coffee or tea. You will want to wait for the big room in the back. You don't want to sit in the front room while everyone in line stares at you eating.  Please beware - not every table has a view of Edinburgh castle! When you are waiting in line (because you will be waiting in line if you want to sit) that first table you see straight ahead is one of the best tables to get a view. The second best view would be the middle table in the middle of the room. You would think being that this is such a popular - let's just say famous - place, their bathrooms would be cleaner. Don't get me wrong, stepping into the bathroom  is a nice read on the walls, but not the cleanest.   Food: The food is HORRIBLE! I ordered their basic Marguerite pizza and I swear it was out of a frozen box. I felt like I was eating cardboard. Again you are not here for the food, you're here because of Harry Potter. Am I right?? I do have to admit though, the bruschetta was AMAZING!!! But the smart thing to do here is to know that the food is not good, but try out a pastry and a coffee or tea. You won't be disappointed.  Customer service- The waiters and waitresses took a long time to take our order but it was packed at the time we came. Then again this place is always packed. They were very nice and kind but don't expect to eat right away. Take in the views and enjoy where JK started it all.   Overall- Like I said, if you are a HP fan this is a definite must. BUT DON'T COME HUNGRY!! Enjoy!",

This is a busy place, and the place JK Rowling would go for coffee whilst penning the first part of her Potter adventures, apparently. Since then, Rowling has done wonders for the publishing industry and given a voice to all closeted young wizards. She's also enhanced the Elephant House takings, not least from tourists and festival-goers and avid Potter readers. A noticeboard brimful of scribbled messages plus cheap internet is a mine of information, especially if you're in town flat-hunting. Service is friendly enough, though sometimes a bit buffeted by chaos behind the counter. Coffee's not the best in town, but the Elephant House is definitely worth a visit.",

No chips, as I'd foolishly expected. And get this, no sauces or relishes available. The waiter brought me salad dressing as the only thing they had! On a burger??? My partner's veggie pie was somehow both soggy and hard, and quite tasteless, disgusting.   Oh, and their \"birthplace if Harry Potter\" claim either.

You won't believe it but you are actually in a bridge, it's George IV Bridge, just look outside the window and you will realise how high up you are!!!   It's a caffe where you can sit down and eat some of the nicest cakes and pastries in townyou even get ones with the shapes of Elephants!!! This place is decorated with elephants all around, photos, little statues, even some chairs have been shaped in an elephant shape   At least 15 different sorts of coffees to choose from, specially recommended to try the one with marshmallows and whipped cream on topalthough you also have diet-friendly options served with skimmed milk.   Shouldn't be forgotten to mention, that the prices are a bit over-rated and that it is really hard to find a table sometimes, so don't count on having a place to sit in.   By the way, you can also get Internet conection in there (unfortunately, you have to pay for that)",

The food and drinks were good quality and the service is good also there are amazing views of the castle which I just think are some of the best in the city and its great to sit with a cup of tea and just stare at the impressive views. The only problem I have is that sometimes it is difficult to get a seat and sometimes you literally have to pounce on a table as soon as it becomes available even if it isn't big enough or small enough for your party.",

The Elephant House is often rather busy, but it is large and if you're happy to share a large table with some people you'll always get a seat. As well as the cafe they also have internet access at the Elephant House these days, useful for the tourist needing to contact home. The food is decent cafe fare and not too bad a price for the centre of Edinburgh, the decor is what gives Elephant House its name. There are elephants everywhere here, for this reason it's a pretty good place to take the kids. Out the back window you get a nice view of the castle and Greyfriars Kirkyard which makes this cafe one of the nicer places to rest in the centre of town.",

This is a tourist trap trading on past glories and tenuous Harry Potter connections (Rowling also wrote at other Edinburgh cafes which have the sense to downplay the links). The coffee is poor, with badly textured milk and too much froth, while food is over-priced and forgettable. The seating and ambiance is awkward, overcrowded, and especially in the back room, filled with screaming kids and tour groups. On the other hand, if you simply want to stare at the seats that J.K. Rowling sat in many years ago, then this is your place. But remember, she would not be found dead here now.",

We went in at 8pm and there was a notice advising us to wait to be seated, so we did... we were the only ones waiting yet the staff decided they could not see us.

So I don'tknow if the coffee is good or the treats are still tasty but I do know that the staff are rude and useless.

The lovely cafe, which is charming in its own right, expectedly attracts all the fans of the authoress as well as a few amateur writers hoping that the place will bestow equal fame and success upon all it's clients. Other writers have claims upon the place, and cuttings on the wall display clippings from Ian Rankin books and other claims to fame. Fame, nonetheless, hasn't gone to anybody's head here, and the atmosphere remains laid back and comfortable, having admirably avoided becoming a Disney-esque attraction. The cakes are delicious and perfect for a late evening indulgence. The beautiful elephant chair is one to be grabbed, and the other paintings and elephant-themed pieces add all the gentle majesty that the beasts inspire, encouraging the writers in the corner to think big.",

With the view of the castle and their specialty drinks, it was a great way to warm up on a chilly Edinburgh day (hot chocolate involving Baileys or Scotch works for me just fine). If only I had enough talent, I could write here the whole novel or, perhaps, short stories involving elephants? - Very writing friendly surrounding  Well - you just need occasionally phase out the tourists.   The other day I met a couple of them - they were studying their maps and guides very carefully, keeping their voices down. I wasn't sure - I thought I heard some German word here or there, but if they were Germans indeed, I would have heard them loud and clear. I guessed Swiss, whose frustration around the world is being mistaken for Germans or being hardly noticeable at all. I couldn't resist approaching them. It turned out they were Swiss from Zurich, a couple of days in Edinburgh on their way to Highlands. After a long chat, they had a few very useful suggestions for me, who still knows zilch about the city. Sometimes it pays off to come across some organized tourists  As opposed to the one writing these words - a disorganized, ignorant me .   One star down for lack of wireless. They have their own internet stations, if you need a quick check. Also, avoid the place if you do not like crowds - it has become too popular for its own good",

Hot cocoa and Baileys basically) was good, as was the slice of Victoria sponge my partner and I shared. I wished we has stopped there, but we were a little hungry, so we ordered a bowl of olives and a salad.  Canned sliced black and green olives. For 5. Thought we ordered the tomato, basil, and onion salad, but there was a miscommunication and we got the chorizo salad instead. Bit of spring mix, a few tomatoes and cucumber slices, the canned olives I mentioned previously, and pepperoni like slices of chorizo. No dressing, just chorizo grease.  28 altogether, for two drinks, an appetizer, a sad salad and a piece of cake.    Take your Potter photos and maybe grab a hot drink, but don't bother with the food here.",

Out of the four of us in my party no one got a meal worth returning for. The summer vegetable soup tasted as if it came from a factory not a kitchen. The chicken pie was mainly crust with almost  no chicken. The mash and gravy were bland. The fish pie was ok but had tiny shreds of fish instead of nice big chunks. And lastly the jacket potato that I ordered with chili con carne was so burnt that hardly any of it was edible. How do you mess up a jacket potato?! I didn't mind having to fetch my own water but it would have been nice to have had the communal pitchers replenished more often than they were.   Oh well, it is The Royal Mile, so one expects to get ripped off. I'll just chalk it up to be a tourist and move on.",

Family of five, stopping to grab a quick bite to eat: ordered five hot drinks (two spiked), one cheese pizza, and an order of nachos.  We were given nothing in the form of cutlery. I had to use my coffee spoon to cut the pizza, as the wait staff never checked on us again. We flagged one waiter down for napkins, he brought us a stack of napkins on top of our bill.   Drinks were okay, pizza was okay, nachos were better.  If you are a potter fan, pay the suggested  donation to take photos. Hungry and thirsty family, there are different establishments in the area to spend that hard earned .  We do not recommend That Elephant House.",

It was great to have a lovely view of the city from our table, and we appreciated the quick service, but I wasn't impressed with our meal at all. We ordered the Scottish Pancakes, which were flimsy and plain. The portion size was also very small. The latte I ordered was fine, but I would have been perfectly happy going to Costa instead.   Overall, I'd recommend maybe just coming here for coffee or tea early in the morning -- that way you won't have to wait in a long line (after 9:00 there were people lined up waiting for a table), you'll get to see the cool writing on the bathroom walls, have a nice view of Edinburgh, and leave whenever you'd like. I wouldn't say it's the place to come for a good meal.",

For my family showing up in the middle of Edinburgh summer, the place was pretty quiet.  Service was OK (no worse than the rest of the UK), food was very reasonably priced and decent (liked the lasagna) and I loved the quirkiness of the place.  I feel this place could take their very well known fame and jack up the prices, redo the place and still capitalize on their fame.  None of this was done, so I believe it is still worth the visit.  It's even a good place to just check out in general in the middle of touristy Edinburgh.",

    "text": "Full disclosure: this review is 5 stars because of the extremely emotional reaction I had as it relates to Harry Potter, and hey, I liked my spiked coffee, too.  So we'd just passed through Victoria Street, and I was already primed for more Harry Potter. (Victoria Street is believed to have been of some inspiration to Rowling for Diagon Alley.) It was around American dinnertime (7pm). They're very proud of their Harry Potter heritage, and they seem to also take liberties with that association. The very front of the cafe, before you even enter, has a banner along the glass outside: \"Birthplace of Harry Potter,\" in curly yellow letters, stylized after the Harry Potter font. Yeah, I'm sure Rowling thought of the idea while sitting in a booth in your cafe... We were seated in about 5 minutes, despite the fact that the place was packed, and I was immediately thrown that they had waiter service. I guess, in my mind, I was seeing a cafe where you ordered at the counter and picked up your food there, but this was more like a restaurant/cafe mashup. Maybe at one time that was how you ordered, but because of the volume of customers, they decided to streamline the ordering service.  Not only is Rowling a known patron, but so is Ian Rankin and Alexander McCall-Smith. It has a huge variety of foods and drinks, from nachos and brushetta, to salad bowls, pizza, lasagna, haggis, bread, potatoes, and a whole lot of other food. Seriously, they are so prepared to cater to everyone.  I gotta admit, though, I could totally see me being a frequent patron if I lived here, gazing out towards the Kirkyard as I sip my coffee. I like elephants, I like coffee, and I like cemeteries. Sounds like a trifecta of inspiration to me. I opted for the coffee with whiskey (\"Irish coffee\"). It came out in a surprisingly huge glass, when I was just expecting a mug. Delightfully, I could actually taste the whiskey, so it wasn't a drink that was particularly watered down. It was enjoyable, hanging out with my traveling companion, basking in the warmth of a cafe where one of my favorite authors once wrote parts of one of my favorite book series.  And of course I made a stop into the bathrooms. What's so special about them, you ask? People from all over the world come here and mark up the bathroom. It's not just some common graffiti, but you'll find quotes, sketches, notes to Rowling, personal stories, etc. on every conceivable surface. And when I saw every conceivable surface, I am being literal. Light bulbs, hand dryers, soap dispensers, corners of the doors, the ceiling, the glass of wall art (rude!), even the bloody ceiling and ceiling lights! It was pretty impressive to think that someone was so into leaving their mark, they chose to do it on the lightbulb on the ceiling. I legitimately felt a lump forming in my throat, and I can honestly say I don't recall ever almost crying in a bathroom before. It really pulls the fandom together for me. It's one thing to know millions of people have read the books and been touched by them, but it's another thing to see the proof--in hundreds of people's handwriting (likely even thousands). I felt very involved in the whole experience, on a very real, visceral level. And I know how cheesy it sounds to say this, but for the first time in a long time... I felt like I was part of something; part of a community.   To a weirdo like me, I rarely ever feel like I'm a part of anything, but when I went back just now and checked out a video I took, I felt tears in my eyes, MONTHS after my visit. It's absolutely cheesy, I know, but when I felt that way, it was a bit overwhelming, in a good way. So no, maybe the food isn't the best, and the drinks are expensive, but I couldn't help but feel the magic when I was in that bathroom, completely blinding me to any other flaws that the cafe might have. It made me feel a part of something... more. And that's definitely worth 5 stars.",

    "text": "As a huge Harry Potter fan, I was so looking forward to visiting this cafe which they advertise as the Birthplace of Harry Potter and where J.K. Rowling sat writing much of her early novels. I went there at different times in the day and it was always so crowded and a huge line waiting to be seated. The next day I went in morning hours and was seated within couple of minutes. Tried their fruit scones and jam along with tea. Both of them were good but nothing great. I think people come here not because of the coffee shop but because of Harry Potter. So here are my individual ratings Atmosphere: Very touristy and somehow did not give the cafe like feeling near the entrance and the counter area. There is a rear dining room which was more open and full of light. Went there on a rainy day and the view from there was great. Rating - 4 Decor: Was decorated with the elephant theme with many sizes and shapes of elephants. Was interesting and very quirky to see.  Rating - 4  Location: Right across the street from the National Museum of Scotland and in the area of George IV Bridge. Rating - 4 Food selection: Has a mixed menu of starters, soup, some salad options, pizza and a number of desserts Rating - selection wise - 4 but what I tasted 3 Service: Slow. Rating - 2 Bathrooms: This deserves a special mention as the ladies bathroom has a Harry Potter theme again. The walls, mirrors, accessories and surfaces have all HP scribbled over it. Interesting to see Rating:4  Overall I would give it a 3 and a half rating. Skip it if you're not a HP fan. If you are a fan worth a visit and then do not miss the bathrooms.",

It's on George IVth bridge, so if you get a window seat, it's a great place for people watching and seeing the world go by. The place is decorated with lots of Elephants (the clues in the name!) so is quite kitsch and cool in comparison to the standard Starbucks and Costas that seem to be on every corner now.   They have a huge selection of teas, coffees and soft drinks so there's something for everyone. Their choice of cakes and pastries/biscuits is a dieters nightmare, as they all taste so good. Particularly famous are the cute shortbread elephants they serve.   All in all it's a very relaxed kind of place.

Its the sort of place where you come to sit and read a book because you can't just pop over to Paris to sit on the Rive-Gauche and you just need that hit of intellectuality.   Even if they are starting to put up adverts all around town proclaiming the magnificence that they must be because they served coffee when JK Rowling wanted some. I bet she didn't have to wait fifteen minutes for hers. But i must stop myself, before you get the wrong impression, because really i love the place (they've even got internet for those of us who have issues with BT), i just don't want you to be completely duped by all the hype..!   So go for it, go drink a coffee, but remember that you're paying for more than just a coffee when you drink one here...",

It attracts such a mixed crowd: tourists, students working away on their laptops, office workers grabbing a quick coffee or lunch. It all adds to the buzz of this place. There is a big selection of teas and coffees; I usually go for the plain old black perculator coffee. 1.85 for a HUGE cup, an additional 50 for any refill. And it tastes good!   The interior is laidback and relaxed with quirky little elephants everywhere, making me feel like I'm sitting in one of my friend's lounge rooms. There is no pretentiousness here - everyone is welcome. Grab yourself a seat in the back next to the window and you'll find yourself having a stunning view of the Castle. Alternatively, browse through the selection of newspapers and magazines available.   Yes, it gets busy so if you can help it avoid this place during lunch times when all the office workers stream in. But apart from that this place is really worth a visit. Don't forget to grab a pastry. They have a fantastic selection; all of them to die for!",

Like everyone else, my friends and I came here for lunch because of the JK Rowling connection after visiting the nearby Spoon Cafe Bistro (also a former cafe where Rowling used to write) and finding the menu too eccentric for us. We were pleased to find that the menu was reasonably priced and really, really good. My chicken tikka baked potato was delicious, as was my smoothie, which I'd been craving all day. The staff was fun and friendly, and the place itself is lovely, with a great view of the castle from the back room (which is said to have inspired Hogwarts). I'll definitely come back if I ever visit Edinburgh again.",

    "text": "Harry Potter to me has always been as interesting and welcome in my life as being slapped across the face with a wet fish, so that's not what made me come here yesterday. My boyfriend has a bit of a thing for elephants though (not in that way, or so he says) and I thought it might be nice to bring him here for lunch.  After getting over the disgust that there were no real elephants here, we found ourselves standing in a queue longer than average and scanning round the room hoping someone would get up so we could steal their seat. I was ready to dive for any table. It's really busy in here so I assumed that could only mean it was good.  We eventually got served, I almost killed a man diving for a seat and we settled down to 'experience the magic' of Elephant House. The magic never came, but I did experience a rather nice baked tattie with tuna, and a mug of coffee which was above average too. The prices weren't too bad, or at least, I expected it to be more expensive because of what previous reviewers have said.   Overall, I quite liked The Elephant House. Not being interested in the be-spectacled child one bit maybe took away from some of the excitement of the place, but people forget that authors like Ian Rankin and Alexander McCall-Smith used to come here to write too, which I find much more appealing. Maybe next time I'll take a notepad with me, just incase.",

    "text": "The famous and official birthplace of Harry Potter. And it sure has a very inspiring setting, with a high ceiling yet cosy main room, views to the castle and Herriot's School(allegedly what Hogwarts is based on) and elephants all over the place, plus a late opening.  Why so few stars? Firstly, because of the Harry Potter claim, this place has become a popular tourist stop as well as over-merchandised. The service is not good for the prices it demands, with the after 6 seated service to be particular slow- all tables seem to be the waiters blind spots. As for the food, well I had a pizza there with a friend and it was basically overpriced soggy cardboard. In another occasion I tried the fajitas- also disappointing. Moreover, the coffee service during the day was particularly unfriendly and impatient. However, I have to admit their French coffee is good. And their late opening hours in a scenic atmosphere are appealing for those who like a quiet evening or read/write. After all, if JK Rowling was inspired maybe it can rub off? The tables are actually quite ideal for this, not to mention the stunning views of the castle from their large windows. If only there were separate stars to give to ambience this place would get 5!   The waiters seem to have many blind spots in the room, but having similar work experience myself, I can completely understand why customers can become invisible. Just make sure you wave enough.  If you do decide to trek here, avoid the lunch hours, as they get to be quite hectic, finding a table is unreliable and the noise level is quite high because of its high ceilings.(and too many small kids) This cafe also has a cousin, Elephants and Bagels which is to my opinion a lot more friendly and less \"stuck-up\" about famous visitors.",

Elephant House have certainly staked their claim in letters writ large though, which means you can't walk past this cafe without ending up in someone's holiday snaps. It also means it's very busy at lunchtime. The sign says get your food before bagsying a table, but you're unlikely to be sitting while you eat unless you have an accomplice to throw your coats onto a couple of chairs while you're in the queue. The food is quite good, I think. I've had some delicious paninis there and some very nice pastries. And not that expensive in my opinion. Service is usually quite fast - they have to be given the popularity of the place, and you can get stuff to take away too. If you have elephant phobia then steer clear, the predominant theme in this cafe's decor is elephant. And yes, if you can get a window seat the views are lovely.",

Frequented by a wide range of people, the staff are friendly and the atmosphere relaxed, and there are elephants dotted around the place to keep children and adults alike amused. There is a delicious selection of cakes, soup and other homemade goodies, making it a great place for lunch. My only reservation would be that occasionally the food can take a while to arrive, especially when it is busy. Otherwise a great place to meet friends or to sit nursing a drink and a cake (or a shortbread elephant) over a good book or newspaper.",

So we decided to just get a T-shirt for the Harry Potter birthplace and she said that she had already shut down the register. (It wasn't even 9:30).

Rowling found the initial inspiration to write the first Harry Potter.   As I look out the window at the Edinburgh castle, I can see how Hogwarts was inspired.    This is a quaint little cafe with many varieties of coffee, pastries, sandwiches, soups and other simple fare.  It has hard wooden floors and tables.  Although it is meant as a place to eat or take things to go, they realize that some people can't wait (there's usually a line for tables) but still want to look where Rowling wrote. So they have a sign that says if you just want to look (and not order anything), to make a small donation of one pound to 'Children's International' a non-profit. I personally like this and think it's a great idea.",

My friend and I stopped by here out of curiosity intending to poke our heads in and venture on. We then looked at the menu, and loved the coziness of this cafe so we decided to get an early lunch here. I ordered the meat pie which came with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy. We also got a teapot to share. The food was so good, one of my favorites I had in Scotland! I was kind of shocked that there were some negative reviews on the Yelp page about the food lacking in flavor since my food was very properly seasoned and delicious. The tea was also great. It was the perfect stop after we had been exploring the city to rest up for a bit and recharge.   If you are a fan of HP then you have to come here. It's like a pilgrimage you make as a fan. If you are not a fan of HP I think you'll find it's a lovely cafe anyway.",

    "text": "I absolutely loved it here!   I am obsessed with all things Harry Potter series so of course I long ago decided I'd be coming by here while in Edinburgh on my vacation. So for those of you who dont know, this cafe is where J.K. Rowling basically wrote the first Harry Potter book, while looking up from her table out the window and seeing am incredible view of Edinburgh castle. The cemetary nearby also inspired alot of her character's names in the books.  I came here around 11 am and was immediately seated at low and behold, a window table looking out at Edinburgh Castle. I cannot even begin to tell you how excited I was when that happened! And the experience just kept getting better, as I ordered my food.  I purchased a Traditional Scottish Cranachan, a plain scone, and a cinnamon flavored moo. I realized that I haven't really had any legitimate authentic Scottish food since I've been here (besides shortbread and tea) so I ordered the cranachan, which is like this warm oatmeal bar with raspberry filling and honey, with fresh whipped cream- and it was so good! I absolutely loved it. I also got a scone because I haven't had a scone since coming to Scotland and it felt like the thing to do. The scone was ok. It kind of looked like a bread roll but the texture of the inside was more like a biscuit. It wasn't like any qcone I've had back home, but it wasn't bad. And lastly, since I dont drink coffee I ordered a Flavored Moo for my beverage, which is a hot milk steamer with your choice of flavored syrup. It was pretty good but nevertheless its essentially just hot milk with a little extra. Total was 12 pounds.  So really the view and the vibes & atmosphere of the cafe, along with the cranachan, made my visit here pretty amazing. So amazing that I came back the next morning and ordered a purple velvet cake slice (ube- do people here not know what ube is?) and Millionaire shortbread. The ube cake wasn't bad, but it was a little dry, and the chocolate on the shortbread was too decadent so I scraped that layer off, leaving just the caramel and shortbread, and that was good.  All in all, if you're a Harry Potter fan, you must stop by! And I highly recommend selecting from the baked goods/ sweets options.",

The alcoholic drinks are strong. - this is a great nostalgic place for Harry Potter fans!   Cons: - the fish pie tasted awful. The steak pie and haggis were okay, but not that delicious either - we waited for 20 minutes but there were a lot of open tables when we were seated  Overall, everyone is here for JK Rowling, so don't expect much for the food.",

    "text": "Four stars for the birthplace of Harry Potter, the Elephant House coffee shop! As a potter lover, this is my Mecca. It is so cool to see pictures of JK Rowling on the walls, from the times she was creating the potter series. When you look out the rear windows, you can see where she drew her inspiration, from the Hogwarts castle, to Diagon Alley. Sooooo cool! Totally geeked out.  In terms of food, you can order some traditional cafe fare, as well as Scottish dishes, like haggis balls over jelly (YUCK!). I had a Scottish coffee, whisky mixed with coffee, and it was ok at best. The service, as expected, isn't great and it took 20 minutes for someone to take our order. They sell elephant house souvenirs, which is nice, and a series of postcards of various potter-esque spots. Also, don't forget to leave some HP love on the bathroom walls! Worth the stop if you are in Edinburgh!",

I give 2 star reviews with a heavy heart, but I was extremely disappointed in my experience here.   The food was lacking in flavor and taste. Maybe it was because I like to have a strong flavor in my food, but there was almost nothing in mine. Maybe splurge for one of their desserts and you will be more pleased.   The crowd seemed to be predominantly tourists that believed the gimmicky use of Rowling's name and fame. As a struggling writer that she used to be, I could see it as a fitting place to get some work done and have a cheap meal.   I would not return.",

My wife and I passed by The Elephant house while visiting Greyfriars Kirk, and noticed the Birthplace of Harry Potter sign on the window, so we went in to explore where JK Rowling wrote her first two HP novels and ended up staying for brunch.  We must have been lucky, because there were no lines (@ 10AM) and we were seated quickly. Nice meal, I tried haggis for the first time.  I was a bit careful, not having it before but knowing what it's made from and have to admit - it's pretty good (not what I expected) and goes well with eggs! If I had to compare it with something, the closest thing I can think of is cajun boudin sausage.   With Rowling's fame, this place could definitely survive as a tourist trap; however, the food was decent and prices were reasonable.  When it's busy, I wouldn't recommend waiting in line 45 minutes to be served - but if you can get seated without a wait, it's worthy of a visit; and if not, donate a helpful charitable quid to the Scottish Filipino Charity Fund and have a look around!",

Prior to working here I was something of a groupie - the boys behind the counter were flirty and gave me free stuff and the boss let me bring in my computer and sit around for hours while I worked on my MSc.  When I finally earned my degree I realised I needed a job in the real world - so promptly begged for employment here.  Working here rocked - mostly.   The cool stuff: The staff, the really awesome selection of tea, french press coffee and tray bakes (I gained so much weight working here because I pretty much lived off of chicken sandwiches, brownie milkshakes and chocolate topped flapjacks...mmmmm).  We were also incredibly inappropriate with each other and customers - best night was when the cook decorated a dessert I needed to take out to a customer with a chocolate syrup penis.  Amazing. Oh and it's also open late - not many coffee places in Edinburgh are which makes this place a wee gem (and there's booze too if you fancy a Bailey's coffee)  The less cool stuff: the food's microwaved and while that works most of the time, sometimes it REALLY doesn't.  It's also full of stupid dirty crappy tourists far too often and as a result, in the afternoons it's nearly impossible to get a table.   Oh and the music - it used to be good but just before I quit it had become a soul destroying loop of horribleness (I won't mention specific band names here because I'll probably offend someone horribly but OMYGODIFIEVERHEARJACKJOHNSONAGAINIMIGHTKILLMYSELF... oops)",

    "text": "A legendary coffee house on the Edinburgh scene, where travellers, students, tourists, locals, writers and everyone congregates for some caffeine infused chit chat. Having a brilliant passing trade position on George IV Bridge is always going to give anywhere a helping hand with popularity, but to be honest, I doubt The Elephant House really needs a boost in that sense, as it's pretty laid back, charming and very enjoyable all by itself.  The coffee is great, as are the teas, delicious looking cakes and savoury food menu. I devoured the chilli dish of the day, plus a chamomile tea, the last time I was in. With the wide and light spaces, and big tables filled with a mixture of bustle and types of people, it's always a real pleasure to come in here, as you feel like there's always something good happening and a bit of creativity going on. Maybe it's just because I miss being a student a wee bit, but I do like overhearing students doing their uni work and having heated debates about whatever topic they're studying. A chilled out place to discuss, work, blether, or think.",

Do Harry Potter fans hope by coming here they will bump into JK? Or Harry Potter will be working there? It all seems very odd to me.   Because of this \"connection\" with Harry Potter, Elephant House does a roaring trade. Goodness knows why because it's a standard cafe selling mediocre cakes and coffee. There are a hundred better (quieter) cafes in Edinburgh, so unless you are a die hard Harry Potter fan there is not reason to go here. In fact even if you are a die hard Harry Potter fan there is no reason to go here, unless you are expecting a wizard to appear and bestow upon you great wealth similar to that of JK.",

I mean common people just cause Harry 'Worthless\" Potter was written here doesn't make it a huge national monument! The place is average at best. The staff didnt seem to helpful if not a little weird. You had to have a member seat you . I thought that was weird for a cafe. The prices seem a little high but I guess when your a national monument you can demand high prices for average food. The plus side of the food was they had a good selection of meals and cakes and whatnot. You can also get a wee pint . But they dont do ice coffee which I thought was strange as well. The coffee was ok as well at least it wasn't burnt I suppose. The decor is cool though I like elephants and they had TONS of elephants all over the place which is very fitting of the name. And the music was totally my style, Bob Marley and Bob Dylan so I liked that. But other then that I was not impressed, although I will come back again to try the place seeing as how its so popular , but for me food doesn't taste better just because some celebrity used this place as her haunt. Just saying....",

With the view of the castle and their specialty drinks, it was a great way to warm up on a chilly Edinburgh day (hot chocolate involving Baileys or Scotch works for me just fine). If only I had enough talent, I could write here the whole novel or, perhaps, short stories involving elephants? - Very writing friendly surrounding ... Well - you just need occasionally phase out the tourists.   The other day I met a couple of them - they were studying their maps and guides very carefully, keeping their voices down. I wasn't sure - I thought I heard some German word here or there, but if they were Germans indeed, I would have heard them loud and clear. I guessed Swiss, whose frustration around the world is being mistaken for Germans or being hardly noticeable at all. I couldn't resist approaching them. It turned out they were Swiss from Zurich, a couple of days in Edinburgh on their way to Highlands. After a long chat, they had a few very useful suggestions for me, who still knows zilch about the city.... Sometimes it pays off to come across some organized tourists ... As opposed to the one writing these words - a disorganized, ignorant me ....  One star down for lack of wireless. They have their own internet stations, if you need  a quick check. Also, avoid the place if you do not like crowds - it has become too popular for its own good ...",

    "text": "I visited Edinburgh with my family in summer 2009, and a friend of mine who went to school at the University  suggested I go to the Elephant House once while I was there. I also came across several articles about this place because JK Rowling wrote some of Harry Potter here. Upon entering the dining area you can understand why; the comfortable casual ambiance of the medium sized cafe has a great view of Edinburgh castle, perhaps the most incredible scenic architectural attraction that looks over the beautiful city, and there is a pretty garden just outside.  Mine, and my family's lunch was great, nothing to rave about but it was definitely good and tasty.  The elephant shaped cookies were cute and tasty.  But even better than the food was the entertainment laying within the desks and tables!  It was so fun to relax and eat while reading the poems, little stories, and excerpts from other people on their travels.  It was quite amazing.  Of course, we all obliged and wrote something to stick in the desks, contributing to this cafe's unspoken tradition.  Books of all kinds line the shelves, and the furniture often has an elephant carved or painted on it somewhere.  The place is downright adorable.  I do love cafes and this one definitely does it right by having there cashier and orders placed at the front where you walk in, and then you go find a table. The dining area is quite nice, especially since it is not right where people order.  ALSO, like most people I encountered in Scotland, the people working were very nice and asked me if I had my student ID card when I ordered so that I would be able to get 10% off.  I love that!  Whenever I end up going back to Scotland, and Edinburgh specifically, I am definitely going to the Elephant House again.",

Elephants and coffee are passions of mine so it was Nirvana.  The cappucinos were ideal-strong espresso, lots of froth. It was never TOO crowded.  Then came HARRY POTTER.  I must say I'm not a fan but was initially impressed that J.K Rowling supposedly wrote the tome there.  In fact, I would often tell the little white lie that I had actually often seen her writing the thing during my visits to the ELEPHANT cafe.    However the last few times I have visited-The Elli (as I referred to it), things have been different.  First of all-the crowds and queues could have been tolerable perhaps without the computers at the front (a bad sign).  Many other people had laptops.  I just think laptops in cafes are wrong. If you are going to write in cafes, it should brief spurts of inspiration written furiously in longhand.  But I digress.  The back room is still beautiful, but crowded.  The cappucinoes are okay but not what they were.  The front is crammed with crowds and elephant chachka (teeshirts, hats, keychains). Ahh...why aren't things as we remember them.",

It looks like they are just a bunch of money-crazed people who only search for more profit. They have failed to maintain the right atmosphere. Spoon at Nicholson street is a much better cafe. If you're another one of those pesky tourists don't go to Spoon and spoil the atmosphere there.

Almost everything about experience was poor, without being actually bad - ultra slow drinks service, ambivalent staff who appeared to treat customers as an irritant (also, my pet hate: drinking and eating their own food behind the counter), really average coffee, and a dreary cooked breakfast, served on a cold plate. The staff showed a lack of interest in changes to advertised food - I asked for an extra sausage, and was told that I needed to order a sausage roll, almost doubling the price of the meal.  Such a shame - the place has bags of charm, but because it makes money hand over fist, there's no need for them to change anything. And they charge for wifi - presumably to dissuade buddy JK Rowlings from camping out all day.  My advice? Take your photo and keep walking. Or if you are near the uni, visit Elephant and Bagel - much better food, and less of an attitude.",

While the staff is lovely and the allure of the Harry Potter legacy make for whatever little charm The Elephant House has, it was not nearly enough to counter the truly horrendous food: the hamburger I ordered had blue mold growing on it and no, that is not an exaggeration. Even had it not been rotten meat that was served on a stale bun, the burger patty was clearly a cheap pre-made frozen grocery store product of D grade quality. It was served with a piece of wilted lettuce, on a stale bun with a side of equally stale, plain potato chips (crisps). I can't think of a more horrific food experience. It was embarassing. I love Harry Potter and JK Rowling but this place deserves a big miss. Sorry.",

Yes I am a Harry Potter fan which might have been the reason I went in originally, but I still like to go now and again. It's nice to see all these really excited people in the cafe taking photos of the cafe and its views of the castle. Although having read other reviews of this cafe, it turns out it's not the actual cafe JK Rowling wrote her books in!! I'm not sure how they can use this claim to fame and it is a bit disappointing.   It's always incredibly busy and there's often big queues so I avoid it for that reason, but I went in the other day with a friend. They have a sign saying you need to wait to be seated. I was a little reluctant to buy coffee and then find there was no seat but when I asked the waiter he said there would be. I presumed he or someone anyway would show us to a seat, but after we bought our coffees it seemed to be a case of find seats yourself, although my friend ended up asking. I think if they're going to have this sign they should follow through and be there to seat people, rather than letting them stand there aimlessly wondering if they can sit at a table with other people they don't know.",

I thought it was this one considering how much they advertise it exploiting the image of JK Rowling. Well, I found out that the Nicolson's is actually (and predictably) in Nicolson Street, opposite the University, and it does not use the writer image to make profit.  Let alone the annoying fact that the place is always packed with annoying tourists taking picture of every single square inch as if it were a museum, the quality is absolutely disproportionate to the prices. This is a way too expensive cafe with nothing special about it, except for the cheesy \"Birthplace of Harry Potter\" banner. The birth place of HP was JK Rowling's mind, I think they should focus more on coffee and food quality rather than marketing.",

There were a number of other cafes she used to frequent.). I wasn't expecting old JK to actually still be hanging out here; I was just mildly curious to see what might have attracted her to write here.  I can see what JK probably liked about this place back in the day - great view of the castle, quirky elephant-themed art and furnishings, a decent cup of latte, and a variety of sandwiches. I bet it was a lot quieter back then, too. Now it's noisy, crowded with tourists, and JK is probably too rich and snobby to ever set foot in here again. Luckily, we happened to come here mid-week in the evening when there weren't so many people there. If you decide to try it, stop by during the middle of the week or late at night to avoid the crowds, but don't go out of your way to visit it. All in all, it's just an average little cafe/bistro.",

The decor is just like over the years they went to rummage sales and bought every bric-a-brac type elephant they saw & lined them up in a cabinet like your nan would do. We went in planning to get lunch but left after tea and went across the street. It's not that it's that bad it's just meh, the prices aren't great, and in this area, there's no reason to settle.",

The decor is cool, with all the elephant related things and again, it is one of those cafes where you can just sit and look at everything (even in the toilets with all the Harry Potter related graffiti) as there is just so much to look at. They also have a really old George IV Bridge Street sign on the wall and have amazing views over the castle.  The menu is wide and varied, with a good selection of snacks, sandwiches and cakes and hot/cold drinks. I was there for breakfast a few weeks ago and had a delicious hot croissant filled with cheese and ham - yum!  So far, so good, so why the 3 stars? Unfortunately service is always really slow...As I went for breakfast on a Saturday, you had to queue at the bar to order (no problem there) but there was a huge queue so I had to wait around 10 minutes to be served. Very slow. The staff also did not really seem to want to be there and were complaining about it being busy - surely that's a good thing?  As the cafe extends around a corner, you also cannot see if there are seats so could end up buying a coffee and there not being a seat which is a pain.  So it's a shame as I love this place, but 3 stars is fair given the slow service and queues. Sadly, even with the Harry Potter connections there are better cafes around.",

    "text": "Lovely interior, great location, this place has a lot of potential.  Unfortunately it sells it self solely on what's written on the banner outside 'the birthplace of Harry Potter'. This was not the birthplace of Harry Potter, it was the train from London to Edinburgh, and the city itself fuelled these ideas. Before being the elephant house, this premises was Nicholsons cafe. When J.K used to sit in the cafe to write Harry Potter, it was in the building which is now spoons cafe. Ironic, when this is the main claim to fame of this place.  Moving on from its main selling point, Nicholson's offers the normal cafe fair found in numerous cafes around Edinburgh. I haven't tried any of their food, my boyfriend and I just came in for a coffee. It was okay, but not amazing, considering how many good coffee shops there are in town.   The cakes look great upon the first glimpse, but head across the road to caffe lucano, and you may feel a sensation of deja vu. The cakes are all the same, maybe add or take a few. Check out a few cafes in town, and you may experience the same thing. It would seem that many of these places buy cake that is made in bulk at some factory out of town. This is not to say that they are bad, maybe they are decent, but it is kind of soulless. When I go to a cafe I often fancy something really fresh, made for the cafe by people at the cafe with much though and attention. How can you go on the hunt for the best carrot cake in town if they are all the same?  Like I said, this place has loads of potential, but I'd rather avoid the crowds and head for somewhere that offers more genuine food. As I said, I can't comment on any of the savoury food.",

    "text": "I can see why JK picked this sacred spot as a haven for writing the first few books of Harry Potter. Before the fame and stature she brought this place, I would imagine that it would be a serene scene for her to get into character and forget the hustle and bustle of Edinburgh. There is also a great view of the Edinburgh Castle from the window that would provide a beautiful work space before the crowds came.  Food: The beef pie was underwhelming and needed more flavor, but came with a generous portion of mashies for my husband's empty stomach. The vegetarian chili, on the other hand, was full of flavor and a delicious treat to warm us up before heading out to explore the city. Hot chocolate was a delight and comes with the option of a ton of fun flavors to add, if you desire. They even put a Harry Potter scar design on my foam!  Staff: The hostess was fantastic and friendly and found us a table right away. However, the baristas up front knew nothing about the menu, couldn't remember all the things we ordered & were slow to serve, which definitely explains the line out the door.  Tourism: Although it was the birthplace of Harry Potter, there is nothing 'Harry Potter' about this place aside from the bathroom and one collage of JK Rowling. If you are going there expecting some shrine to HP, you will be disappointed.  Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere of this place. It was a welcome and warm resting place while touring the city!",

    "text": "Being the obsessed Harry Potter fan that I am, I had to visit The Elephant House, famous for being the site where JK Rowling would slowly nurse her coffee while writing the Harry Potter books. The girl's bathroom was completely covered with comments from adoring fans and there was a nice coffee shop vibe.  I had the rocket salad with lox. It was pretty standard, though there was way too much olive oil on it. I also shared the Veggie Antipasti Platter. The roasted sweet potatoes and mixed salad were great! However, the egg tortilla was too bland and needed copious amounts of pepper. The toasted bread that came with my salad and the platter was good and I am always glad when the butter is slightly melted and easier to spread.  Service was friendly, but a bit slow. The real appeal of The Elephant House is that it is the birthplace of Harry Potter and if you are a huge Harry Potter buff, it's nice to check out.",

    "text": "The only reason we decided to eat at the Elephant House was because it's the place where JK Rowling supposedly wrote some of the early Harry Potter books.  Based on the signs and articles posted in the restaurant, they knew that was a drawing point for many customers.  Even though it was crowded, we managed to get a table easily in the back room during lunch time.  You could see the same views JK had as she was writing the book.  Outside of that, the restaurant didn't really offer much more.  The food was ok.  I had a 4.50 ham & cheese baguette that included a small side salad.  My suggestion would be to stop by for a quick photo, but go eat someplace else if you want a better meal.  For the price of a basic sandwich, you don't get very much.",
