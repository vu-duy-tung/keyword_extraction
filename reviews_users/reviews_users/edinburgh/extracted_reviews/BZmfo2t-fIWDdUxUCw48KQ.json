    "text": "I recently ordered from them via Uber Eats. I had the bolognaise pasta with spaghetti noodles and an order of garlic bread. The bread is sliced like pizza and was just okay, not quite thick enough the way I like it. The pasta was good but missing the \"tub of Parmesan cheese\" that it was supposed to come with. I had my taste buds all ready for spaghetti and Parmesan, the absence was noticeable to my pallet but the food was good on its own so I forgave the error. Prices are really good for the area and delivery is around 30 minutes. Give them a try.",

I called back someone apologized and said they would resend it, wait another hour and call back and \"we're a little bit busy, you have to keep waiting or I'll refund your money\" wow way to not help the customer out.",
