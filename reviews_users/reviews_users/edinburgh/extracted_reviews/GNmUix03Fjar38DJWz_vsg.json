However, once we managed to order, everything arrived reasonably quickly and the waitress was very friendly. We ordered prawn katsu udon (very delicious), chicken katsu udon and salmon bento for main. Also, the 16 pieces sashimi selection.  Everyone was very happy with their food choice and it was very good value as the portions were very reasonable. Even better with 10% off for checking in on Yelp.  Will definitely come back and become a regular.",

    "text": "I love Kenji sushi. Now been three times and even booked it to celebrate my birthday earlier this month.  Great quality food but not expensive at all. We had a great meal (6 of us) and our bill was just over 20 each for a ridiculous amount of food, including sushi sets. The fish is always super tasty and fresh and everything I've had is fab.  Lovely, casual vibe and drinks are reasonably priced with bottles of wine around 14.  Quite a large menu of starters, tempura, rice, noodle dishes, sashimi, nigri and various sushi sets. The sushi sets are fab value and commonly around 10 for beautifully presented food. Vegetarian friends are well catered for here as there are loads of options.  Staff are great at accommodating gluten free and even provide gluten free soy sauce which is a nice touch so you are not left out.  This is my too choice for sushi - food is always spot on, great service and I love the casual dining experience without it all being a bit Yo sushi! Five stars from me :-)",

    "text": "So here goes guys- a new sushi joint in Stockbridge! And let me say, I am completely and utterly delighted!  Firstly, if you're going for lunch they may not be open at 12pm as stated on this page. I know this because I went for lunch today at 12.30pm and they were closed- so might be worth checking first.   I returned for dinner because, c'mon, it's sushi! And it's all shiny and new!  I booked via yelp (yay!!) for tonight. Service was fantastic, I cannot fault the friendly and helpful servers who were the perfect balance of not overly involved and involved enough that we were never left waiting too long.   After going through the menu which extends beyond sushi to Japanese curries and noodles dishes, we just ordered a whole bunch of stuff for the table to pick at.   The vegetable tempura was and absolute delight. Quite a hefty serving too that was so light and delicate, just a pleasure to eat. We also shared a classic sushi plate, octopus sashimi, dragon roll, gyoza, chicken yakitori and eel nigiri. To keep it short- everything was delicious.   I highly recommend the volcano roll and salmon sashimi which was really fresh and flavourful. Oh and the chicken yakitori- holy toledos was it scrumptious. Even with a full belly I still managed to scoff a skewer down.   There are a range of Japanese spirits available and a choice of two wines (red).   Costing is extremely reasonable too. I mean, we fed three people with six drinks and the bill came to 66. Not the cheapest meal you'll find but for decent quality sushi and Japanese it's what I'd expect to pay.   Whilst not the best sushi I've ever eaten in my life, but this was an incredibly enjoyable meal. It's a small venue and I would reccomend booking in advance. I anticipate as these guys find their feet in this area this will be a highly sought after dinner location in no time!",

Peaceful...Out of Scotland as soon as you set foot, which is desirable sometimes when you've had enough of real life, no fault of Scotland...  like stepping into Asia of days bygone, zen... Not part of the meaning crowd.   A delight in Stockbridge which is as Edinburgh as you can get!    I had the Nigiri set which is 7 piece sushi of all kinds fishes! Plus 2 pieces sweet cakes made of egg pudding and 2 pieces of rice wrapped in sweet skin made of soy protein. Large sake -- two small bottles with 50% discount because you know your limit before you ordered!  I love sake and can drink a large bottle, no problem!    Great staff!  Good service!",
