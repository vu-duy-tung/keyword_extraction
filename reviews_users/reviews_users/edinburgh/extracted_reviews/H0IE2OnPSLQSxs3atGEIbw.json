    "text": "Really, I wanted to go to Mithas, but they were closed for refurbishment. So, I searched on Yelp for a decent alternative, and Lancers came up - and good reviews were relatively in abundance. I'm not 100% sure I ate at the same place as I feel my experience was entirely different.   Service was beyond rubbish - from forgotten drinks to just being forgotten. The hot towels in other reviews? Went to other tables bar us. I had to give up on the bill and go to the bar to pay, where there was no apology or interest, and the bill silently shoved at me. Service is part of what you pay for, and we definitely got a rough deal here.   The menus should have also been another indicator of care - dirty and stained, but I tried to look past that to thinking - I've heard the food is good so lets focus in on what we came here for. In the end, all three of us opted for thali.   In fairness, the food was decent - for me the sabzi jalfrezi was the best of the dishes (dhal (lentils), saag paneer (tasted very odd. Seaweedy odd, which was a strange under-flavour to the dish and didn't work very well and sabzi jalfrezi (vegetable jalfrezi) - and not as spicy as I thought a jalfrezi would be. The boys enjoyed the lamb offerings in theirs, too. Our starters were all average to start with, with the SR noting that my vegetable pakoras looking like the same that you buy anywhere.   After an enormously long time, the Silent Reviewer reached his breaking point and demanded our desserts - whether any of us wanted them or not - which comprised of some seriously freezer burnt, bright orange kulfi. I haven't had kulfi before, but if this is the best, then I wouldn't be rushing back - but I suspect this is, like the rest of our experience, not the norm.   Perhaps I should have read the other reviews more closely - as the majority praise Lancers take out rather than dining - and the other 4 star is for food, and ignores the terrible (and similar) service. Lancers also offer a private dining area - I dread to think what it would be like if you were tucked away from the general public, but I for one definitely won't be trying it.",

The okra was a big hit, as was the spinach with butternut squash. The mixed vegetable dish we got (I forget which one it was) was less exciting but still decent (just too heavy on the potatoes for my tastes).  Prices seemed reasonable for what we got.",

    "text": "We recieved great service as soon as we walked in - from taking our coats to hang up, tucking us into our chairs, general friendliness and attentiveness with advise on how much rice and nan bread to order; a bit of humour thrown in and a hot towel to cleanse our hands at the end.   I was suprised that there wern't many pakora options on the menu, however it contained a vast selection of other dishes including vegetarian, meat and seafood. We all opted for starters to begin with which were yummy. I had Panir Cutlet - shallow fried cheese - soooooo good and none of the grease that comes with deep fried foods. Normally I have a favourite Indian meal which I order pretty much in every Indian restaurant I go to but I went for something different this time - Kashmiri Murgh - chicken in a mild sauce with tropical fruit and exotic spices. There was plenty of it when it arrived and it was delicious - not too sweet at all! Unfortunately none of us managed to finish our mains because we were just so full from the starters.   This is the most enjoyable Indian meal I have had and it didn't leave me with a bloated feeling I normally get after eating Indian food. I will definately be more adventurous with my choices from now on too!  The restaurant itself is smallish but light and modernly decorated with a few pictures depicting scenes from India. I would have just liked to feel a bit more of India in the decor.",

    "text": "I enjoy Indian food but find most Indian's come with a layer of grease and can often be quite disappointing. A friend recommended Lancers so we got together and ordered a takeaway from here. I was majorly impressed, there is definitely a jump in quality from the standard Indian restaurant and Lancers Brasserie. The Samosas were like nothing I had ever tasted before, so full of spices and again, without that grease that usually comes with a takeaway.   With neither of us being big eaters, we shared the chicken Bryan which we both enjoyed. It was enough for two to polish off.   I have heard that the restaurant is much better and the staff are very friendly, although it is maybe a little more expensive than the usual Indian. But I think that is because it is that bit better.",

    "text": "So, I ate in the restaurant recently.  The food was, of course, still incredibly good and the food is served on these trays with little candles in them to keep everything warm, but .... but ... the service and the atmosphere were definitely lacking.  The atmosphere was almost sterile.  It was reasonably modern but not in a chic kind of way.  The room itself has potential to be very interesting but the choice of decor just makes it feel dry and uninteresting.    The wait staff, though, are where the real fault sits.  They were incredibly stiff, never smiled, hardly paid any attention to our table even when we were trying to a) order drinks or b) get the bill.  We'd ended up ordering a bit too much food so, considering this place does takeout, we figured it wouldn't be a problem to ask for a takeaway container.  The miserable look we got from the server said it all.  He did put our food in a takeaway, but he literally mixed everything (side garnish salad and all) into one container and plonked it on our table like it was a bag of rubbish.    The four stars are because, at the end of the day, the food is exceptional and you can order it for takaway and bypass the stuffy staff.",

It's been open for quite a few years and the interior is starting to look a little tired now. it's perfectly clean and pleasant just not as pleasant as the food.   The service is pretty good, although was occasionally a little too keen.   Theres a fairly varied menu, with a large number of chicken dishes. A number of traditional favourites such as tandoori chicken and chicken jalfrezie as well as a good choice of everything between korma and vindaloo. A number of the dishes are available with either chicken, lamb or king prawn.   The lamb khatta tarkary (a sauce of chopped garlic and tomato) is absolutely amazing!   The portions were fairly large which means it's good value for money, even though it's a little pricey (mains were about 9-15).",
