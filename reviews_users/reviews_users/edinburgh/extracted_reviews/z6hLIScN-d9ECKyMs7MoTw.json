    "text": "If you go here, just let the waiter know your dietary requirements, go for the mixed platter and let them choose. It's the only way to do it. The food was all beautifully prepared and presented and tasted as good as it looked. Particular favourites of mine were the rice wrapped in vine leaves dish... and the aubergine one... and well they're all pretty good. Feeling brave? Go for a glass of Aylan, not for everyone but it perfectly complements the dishes.",

    "text": "A quick Sunday evening meal to fill a void the night before a work event somewhere that's not home.  Compact, bordering on snug. Friendly and attentive service. A nice range of options: able to accommodate many dietary requirements.  The hoummous was unctuous, garlic heavy and fabulous with a basket of warm home-baked bread. Yumm-o. The Iskendar: slices of chicken on pitta with a savoury sauce, oven baked to loveliness, served with savoury rice, salad & tursu. It did not disappoint.  I'm suspicious of city centre restaurants purporting to be authentic. This place has dispelled that particular stereotype.  A must return.",

    "text": "The best Turkish food in town ! They have small tapas style dishes. They bring it close to 9 varieties. They are all yum and a must try. My favorite of the lot is the grilled sausage. This spread is quite filling. We did not realize that and had additionally ordered grilled chicken and we couldn't finish it. I have been there twice in a week already",

At the end of the meal, as we wanted to pay, they told us the credit card machine wasn't working and that there was a sign.  Yes, its a sign about 8-1/2 by 11 posted in a corner of the room!   Who is going to see that?  They apologized for not telling us about that before we ordered but its really inexcusable.  Fortunately, we had enough cash.  Service was friendly.",
