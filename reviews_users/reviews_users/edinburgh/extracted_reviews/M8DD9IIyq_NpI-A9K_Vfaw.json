Lovely man, very cheerful and a credit to his team at McDonald's.",

    "text": "The hunt for pancakes was interrupted by McDonald's not serving anymore pancakes after 10.30 am. What a shame.  Can't tell how disappointed I was to hear that Breakfast time was over - so early - during the day. Well, 10.30 might not be early for you on a Saturday morning, but for a lot of people it can be :-)  It was a rainy day and I was so eager to get some pancakes that I made a quick turn for the nearest McDonalds (on Gorgie Rd) and even went over the corner of  the pavement damaging my fab tires. The rain was so heavy that when I arrived at the entrance I was soaked, but still longing for my coffee.  The place was quite small. Not much seating. Quite plain. A small counter and a few people serving the core McDondals lunch menu. I ordered a cheeseburger and chips, which were average.  I believe that the dining area is deliberately small, as the main function of this premise is to be a \"Drive Thru\", conveniently located opposite Aldi and down Gorgie Road.",

There is some good sitting area and as it is small restaurant and not in city centre it is not so busy as other ones. You can sit in peace and quiet and enjoy your food.",
