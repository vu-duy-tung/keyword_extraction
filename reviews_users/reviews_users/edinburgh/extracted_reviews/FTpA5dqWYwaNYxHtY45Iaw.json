I went on a very sunny day before going to see Muse at Meadowbank a couple of years ago, and had what can only be described as an alcoholic ice cream float. It was absolutely delicious.   The bar is very small inside, but there is seating outside, which is great for smokers or non-smokers trying to catch the sun on a rare balmy day.",

The staff are friendly and attentive, and if you don't know what to choose they'll ask a few things that you like and will concuct something amazing. It's best to go midweek as you can usually get a bit of banter going with the bar staff, at the weekend it gets really busy. The best (or maybe worst?) thing is that they will open a tab for you and come to your table and take your order. I've ended up spending small fortunes in here.",

When you ask for a cocktail at some lesser establishments you often receive a glass of what looks (and tastes) suspiciously like Barry Scott's Cillit Bang, but not at Toni C's where the quality is second-to-none. However, steer clear of his confectionaries; half a pound of mutton-like cake is not what I would describe as a 'delicate sponge'.",

I often go here for lunch on a Saturday, and they clearly put as much careminto the quality and service of their food as they do their drinks. Great place for nice salads, bruschetta and snacks and the level of service here is really terrific. If you find yourself peckish in the part of town its definitely worth a visit. Be warned, however; you may find yourself lured into spending the rest of your day here trying their cocktails.",

The drinks were great and the staff behind the bar were attentive, chilled and fun to interact with, at about 8 a live accoustic set started, so I ended up staying for most of the night!! after such a good Thursday I went back on the Friday to find a decent hose DJ playing.. the place was busy, but although small it was a good atmosphere and so the drinks kept flowing again.. a lot of fun.. I recommend it!! TONIC.",

    "text": "I used to frequent this bar a lot a few years back when the cocktails were around a fiver each (now closer to 8) and apparently the reason I never got turfed out for being mangled was that I was a great tipper. At 8 quid a drink there will be no more getting mangled or tipping!!  The menu has changed a lot, still varied but the only ice cream cocktail left is the Barney Rubble. Why they've dropped a lot of the ice cream ones I don't know. The menu is still varied but a lot of the cocktails just didn't tickle me.  On this occasion I ordered my favourite tipple, a caipirinha. This drink can either be really good or really bad depending on the skill of the maker. Although the bar man was lovely, unfortunately his version of a caipirinha was really bad. I had a better one at Las Iguanas the week before.   I also tried a toffee apple but it seems to me that staff would be hard pressed to mess up that drink what with the flavoured vodkas doing the work.  On a side note, the staff have always in the past played what music they like and I suspect that some were \"budding dj's\" with the MacBook being out on the bar. The music has always been loud and it probably is still too loud for the size of the place.",

Tonic was our last watering hole after an evening of eating, drinking & becoming very merry.   One consequence of the choice available is that inevitably, during every order, at least two people in our group changed their minds repeatedly as some other concoction caught their eye.   The staff were friendly and patient throughout and everyone (that could still maintain some coherence) commented on what an enjoyable end to the evening it had been.",

    "text": "Tonic concocts some fantastic cocktails, this fact cannot be argued. The speciality, focus of knowledge and reliable quality of this bar is the array of cocktails that can be requested here, so whether you're a traditional Cosmopolitan or Mojito sipper, or you want something with a bit of an out of the ordinary twist to it, Tonic will comply with your beverage supping needs.   When I'm in here, depending on what mood my palate is in, I usually go for the French Martini, which is always pretty awesome, or a classic Cosmo, apologies if that sounds very unadventurous, but it always goes down a treat. The inside of the bar is sleek, stylish, and very well finished, so you'd be well recommended to visit here if you like to drink your cocktails while looking trendy in a pristine environment. It is pricey though, as is most of George Street, so a few cocktails down and your purse will definitely be less of a weight on your bag. It's also pretty miniature, which can be nice on weekdays when town is quieter, but slightly hard to handle at the weekends, when this place is packed with cocktail requesters.",

Paying up to 9 for a single drink does take something away from the gorgeousness of the beautifully made works of cocktail art, although there is no denying that these bar staff know what they're doing.  Call me boring, but I went for my staple dirty vodka martini. On the basis that I drink them almost everywhere I go, I figure that's the fairest way to judge them all... it definitely got a thumbs-up from me. And let's face it, it's not as if there aren't more than enough cocktail emporia on or around George Street. Which is why this place deserves it's amazing reputation, as it stands out from all the others with the sheer quality of the place.  I have to say, I did feel like a bit of a Sex & The City wannabe sitting there with three of my friends, analysing our love-lives and wearing high heels. But you sort of end up doing it unintentionally in here, with the plush booths, good-looking waiters and tasty tipples. And it's not just the surroundings that look beautful - i've never seen so many different glasses, crazy fruit garnishes! and flamboyant colours and wonderful tastes this side of Rio Carnival!

    "text": "So, technically four stars for superb and delicious cocktails and 2 stars for the tapas on offer leads us to a healthy 3 star review.   The good is some fab cocktails - Monkey Got a Gun involved (but not exclusive of) fudge infused whisky and Innis & Gunn - served in a miniature beer mug and quickly disposed of. Monkey Laird was a fine way to end the evening... although my head was definitely unhappy the next day. It seems that Tonic tries to avoid the standard cocktail and deliver a choice variety, for that I welcome.   The bad: it's super loud. For somewhere that you can sit down for food, the two don't go together. Plus, with the door open, we enjoyed our dinner with cigarette smoke. We were there with Groupon (4 tapas plates each and one side, plus a dessert cocktail) so thought that we would have plenty of food, but we ended up plenty wanting. The tapas on offer is meagre by any shout - the plates in front of us were pretty bare, including -   * gambas counted to 4 prawns, one each, hurray! * ratatouille consisted of three pieces of aubergine with canned tomatoes and one lonely slice of red pepper;  * mackeral pate seemed more like mackerel flavoured mayonnaise - very runny for a pate!  The dessert cocktail was just disgusting - cookies and cream icecream, Baileys and Creme de Menthe. Not even my mint ice cream loving sister could bear it.   For bang for your buck, there are better tapas options elsewhere. We left, definitely tipsy, poorer of pocket (cocktails are not cheap, but definitely worth it) but not particularly satsified, despite the vast number of plates on our table. For cocktails, it's a win, but food and ambience, it's not.",

It seems to be considered by some to be Edinburgh's best cocktail bar. It isn't.  With banging house music in the background and staff dressed like Urban Outfitters mannequins, the atmosphere wasn't quite the laid-back, pianist in the corner type feel I prefer in cocktail bars. A lot of the punters were exceptionally drunk as well, lowering the tone a bit but then again it was around midnight, and we were in a bar so perhaps that's nit-picking.  The smoked whisky sour I had was alright, but by no means great, though since Tonic's cocktails tend to be a bit off the wall in their flavours I can appreciate that there's a certain hit and miss element to the menu depending on your tastes. Given the praise it gets elsewhere I'd assume there must be better.  We left fairly quickly, as the ear-splitting music volume and sleazy atmosphere weren't doing it for us. Despite friendly customer service from the top drawer and a fairly large menu, I doubt I'll return in a hurry.",

    "text": "I popped in here last weekend after reading the rave reviews on Yelp, I was expecting great things but left completely under whelmed and a little bit disappointed if I'm honest. Did I go to the same place? It's the most average cocktail bar on the planet and the prices are ridiculous for somewhere that's not particularly a nice place to sit. It reminded me of the Monkey Bar in Glasgow which is crap and always empty... for a reason. Tonic on the other hand was hoaching last Sunday and I'm not really sure why.  I ordered a Gimli's Breakfast Fizz... or something like that, it was okay but it didn't exactly rock my world. For two cocktails it came to 13 which I guess is quite reasonable but it's not exactly a fancy place, it's just so basic so I kind of begrudged the 13 when you can get cocktails in similar styled bars for around 4.   I was also a little bit miffed as a group of girls beside us ordered awesome looking cocktails with ice-cream and fruit smoothies in them which I couldn't see anywhere on the menu and they bought 3 of these babies for 9. Was I missing something? Or were they just giving the bar staff extras afterwards? I wouldn't like to say... Either way, I was pretty under whelmed by the whole experience and left thinking... \"is that it?\" In fact I drank my cocktail in record breaking time so I could leave.  On my visit there was a huge range of ages, which is good but rather tragic when a suited up late 30 something plonked himself down beside a very young looking group of girls who look both terrified and confused by the wannabe Lothario's advances.  To be fair the bar staff were really nice and the guy making our cocktails chatted to us for a while which was a nice level of customer service. I'm giving this place 3 purely because of the friendly bar staff, but I won't be going back, nothing to see here really. Next!",

Certainly cool. 4) The drinks menu has more choice than I can think to describe in a singe metaphore. 5) Theres a great atmosphere - its a cool, trendy vibe, but also relaxed and fun.  But now for the bad.  1) Expensive. 10 for what is effectivly fruit juice and vodka, no thanks. 2) Because Tonic is small, it gets busy and uncomfortable quickly. 3) Waiting 7 hours for a drink while the barman shakes and stirs and filters and mixes and flips it all about while singing mama mia is not cool.

Yep, remember those paper things filled with sherbet? This cocktail comes with them, two if you are lucky. They have a nice adult touch - the bottom of the flying saucer melts in the alcohol and the sherbet falls out into the drink  - yummy! The bar itself is small and it is one of those places you need to get to early otherwise its a bit of a squeeze. The cocktail menu gets revamped every few months - for awhile the Lemon Drops were off the menu, but they are clearly back by popular demand (me always asking for them?). The decor is modern - I think there has been a bit of redecorating going on over the last few months (maybe I'm wrong and had too many Lemon Drop's when I was in last time). No food available apart from crisps and sometimes glasses full of sweets are on the tables - yum, more flying saucers.  It's the Lemon Drops which lure me here (and my mum) so for this cocktail alone, it's well worth a visit.",

    "text": "I had heard the cocktails in this wee hidden bar were fantastic, and as a reviewer for Yelp, I felt it was my professional duty to find out just how good. The things I do for you guys!  At first, I really didn't get what the fuss was all about, but as soon as I ordered from the drinks list (about three days later because it is actually soooo big!) and my very elaborately garnished and yummy looking cocktail came, I realised what all the fuss was about. I had a Silver Mercedes, and if I would have had two, I probably wouldn't be able to tell you any of this!  My boyfriend stumped for a pint (bore) and the bill was just under 15! Expensive but so totally worth it! I may have found a place to rival Glasgow's Metropolitan!",

    "text": "Yes, Tonic has the best cocktails in Edinburgh!!  It is a really modest place, it's really not flash yet always has a brilliant atmosphere. To get here you have to go down some stairs, and the bar itself is really quite small. It can therefore get really uncomfortable when it's busy, you can't get to the bar and the wait is made twice as long as the waiters are meticulous with their cocktails. I once had a cocktail in an actual jam jar! My brothers girlfriend and I spent about 30minutes looking over the extensive menu to decide what we were going to have. When we decided, we both wanted what the other was having so ended up doing a swap. This is definitely one of the gems in the city!",

    "text": "Contrary to the other reviewers, I was a bit disappointed when I visited this bar for a mid-week drink. The place was dead and so completely lacked in atmosphere and yet they continued to play painfully loud dance tunes so that my friend and I couldn't hear ourselves speak. Suffice to say, we left after one drink.   I would go back, but I'd wait for a weekend.",

It presents a somewhat more appealing atmosphere than its pretentious neighbours, and its cocktails are on a par with Tigerlily's.   The Zombie is guaranteed to destroy a considerable portion of your prefrontal cortex. Fantastic.",
