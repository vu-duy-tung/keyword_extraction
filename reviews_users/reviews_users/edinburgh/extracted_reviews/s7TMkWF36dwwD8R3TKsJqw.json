I came in after walking by this place for the millionth time , after deciding that I had some time to kill and I wanted some wine . Very nice interior and enjoyed the vibes it puts off. I could sit in a little nook and enjoy some vino while I read or people watched. The interior is very open and I feel like to me sophisticated. Loved the service and the wine I had was excellent ! I will be coming back for food and this review will be updated!",

We had the house prosecco which was really reasonably priced and absolutely scrumptious. The thing that impressed me most was the food. I had the BBQ beef brisket, cheese and black pudding sandwich. Oh my goodness. I am a massive fan of the slow cooked meats thing that is happening right now and this was probably the best thing I've tasted in this genre. No too sweet or sloppy. The black pudding added a lovely umami undertone to the sandwich and then gooey cheese on top in a round panini bun! Noooooooooom!!!!   I highly recommend this place and they even give you lollys with the bill!!!!!",

    "text": "My husband really, really, really love this bar. We loved it prior to it morphing into The Huxley and we'll probably love it when it morphs into something else in the future.  So, what do we really love about this bar? THE COCKTAILS and the decor and the live music but mostly THE COCKTAILS.  Yeah, all caps on that one.  The cocktails, oh, the cocktails. With handcrafted cocktails ranging in price from 6.50-8, you just can't go wrong. We have yet to find better value for money anywhere in Europe. Plus the drinks are fantastic. Like, super, super good.  I drank many Comfortably Plums. Oh, so, damn plummy and lovely.  My husband drank many Huxley Harpoons and Smooth Like a Brazillians. He loved both and I had a taste of his Huxley Harpoon and I almost left Comfortably Plum for Huxley Harpoon but I realized that I was just too comfortable with Comfortably Plum to ever leave her (or him). YUM.  The other great thing about this bar is that they have table service and I'd say the service is a touch about average. Sure, you have to do the \"European I need something\" wave every-now-and-again but whatever. They will come running over (thought note that service does fall a bit when they are busy). Basically, walk in, someone will greet you, take a seat, and someone will be over in a snappy-snap to take your order.  Last, the restrooms/bathroom/toilets/WCs at this place are top notch. If you are out sightseeing all day and need someone to relieve yourself and rehydrate (they also have a shiny big coffee machine behind the bar), then this place is for you.  OK, last, last, they have a live music sometimes. I'm not sure when but a musician was playing during one of our visits and he was lovely!",

We started with the fried panko crusted olives with an alioli dipping sauce. Not sure if this was more of a technical flaw but the olives used were just too meaty and large. Would have preferred the smaller olives. I didnt enjoy the dish so much.  Then we had burgers. The cheesburger and the Philly cheesesteak. First off the cheeseburger was dry. Not a fan of the two patties, who are they trying to copy? The Big Mac!? Not a good idea. Also the Philly Cheesesteak was not just that. It was a burger with peppers. Not really that exciting.   You can get better burgers elsewhere as far as I'm concerned.",

The place has a nice feel, is well lit, decorated.....lots of interesting furnishings that you notice the longer you spend there. 15 for a bottle of prosecco too is always going to be a win for me.  Their food to read is interesting if a little \"fryer centric\", so this Sunday few frioends and our mums went for some prosecco and ordered a heap of their small plates to share.  Fish goujons - dry and under seasoned Panko olives - liiiiiiiike Wedges - liiiiiiiike Beef tacos - weirdly on top of a napkin that then stuck to the food Meat platter - tasty Chicken wings - RAW!!!!

    "text": "Not bad, not bad at all...  I hadn't managed to get to this reincarnation of The Rutland (the hotel still has the name) yet, and when I had to organize a wee dinner to 'show off' some of Edinburgh (after being informed that it had to be in the city centre and to get there we had to see a fair bit of Edinburgh...yes, dinner has these stipulations!) I thought it's reasonably fancy looking surroundings but causal atmosphere would be ideal.  The Huxley seems to be cocktail bar meets hunting lodge, with some hipster sprinkled on top. I comes together quite well though our table had those flip up cinema seats which I couldn't get used to! There's a good bit of faux tartan and some nice couches and armchairs.   I admit I was surprised by just how casual the menu was. We started with haggis spring rolls, the sesame tuna and a cauliflower patty of some kind. Everything was delicious though the tuna stood out!   For mains we all had burgers, and wow! Everyone was impressed. The burgers are smaller than you find elsewhere, I could eat it one handed, but came with two burgers! And the meat and seasoning was fantastic. I have slowly managed to train myself not to deconstruct food over the years but the meat on these burgers was so amazing each element had to consumed alone. The bun was also wonderful, slightly sweet but not overly so. The chips were chips, but good'uns.  For dessert I had the peanut butter and jelly cheeseNOMNOMNOM....sorry, I just had a flashback of me devouring this perfect dessert, cheesecake was what I meant to say. My friend got a Knickerbocker Glory and I got to experience the childlike glee they invoke when you see one for the first time (I work with grown ups from other countries where they don't grow up begging their parents for knickerbocker glories after every meal).   The service was generally ok, though slow and a bit frazzled. I think they could use another person on the tables on a Wednesday night, especially at this time of year.  Overall I'll do my best Arnie impression....'I'll be back'.... There's drinks offers on throughout winter and if you sign up to their mailing list you get 30% of your bill. That's loads!",

It's all so well-engineered and presented that it loses any charm or interesting element.   They do decent cocktails, but I'm not a huge cocktail fan so it's a bit lost on me. They do a decent range of beers, but they all fall under the \"Standard Life employee\" price tag. I'd rather go to the Hanging Bat for a beer.   I haven't eaten here so can't comment on the food. The bathrooms have this weird little hole in the wall so you can see when blokes are washing their hands. Not sure how I feel about that oddity (bit creepy?).   However, it's handily placed for catching up with old friends and is ideal for the bus stop. So it has its merits. It's just fine. I think this place continues to endure because of its location.",

I believe it has changed hands more times a parcel during a game of pass the parcel played by a group of hyperactive kids.  The Huxley is a fantastic looking place however, it's obvious that the owners have splashed out on some very tasteful furniture and decor. The staff were also very friendly, the bar well stocked and there was a nice selections of draught beers on offer. I also enjoyed the music, not too loud and added nicely to the vibe of the place.  Prices however are pretty steep, something which I'm sure the owners realise. You can tell they are after a certain type of clientele here, as you are greated at the door by a YAT (young attractive female).  Had a wee swatch at the food as it passed and it looked pretty tasty. Nice place for a wee upmarket drink if your in this neck of the woods.",

    "text": "this review will be short and sweet (rather like the cocktail i had) as i was only in the huxley briefly for a pre-dinner drink.  my first reaction on walking in the door was a bit of astonishment as the place is completely different from the rutland bar that previously inhabited the location.  and completely different in a very excellent way!  gone are all the tall dark chairs and dark colours that made the bar well very dark.  instead there are softer colours with smaller normal sized chairs and a brightly white tiled war with the taps behind the bar.  there are also so cosy arm chairs but again remaining a normal size not the monster size ones that the rutland had.  the drinks menu is rather short, but i don't think this place is aiming to be an extensive cocktail bar as they have a fairly large selections of beers.  so much more a place to have a beer, which suits the menu of burgers and hot dogs.  however, the cocktail list does have a good choice and i went for the breakfast mojito while the boyfriend went for the full moon.  our drinks took a wee bit of time to arrive, but i watched the bartender making them fresh so it's nice to know that they take care when mixing up drinks and the taste shows their effort is worth it.  my mojito was a lovely twist on the original.  made with grapefruit juice limes and mint it was very fresh tasting.  i could actually see how this might compliment a breakfast haha!  my boyfriend's drink was quite nice as well the blue moon beer added a nice creamy touch while the bourbon gave it a good kick.  so first impressions are good and we've both decided we need to go back and try some of the food.  so look out for an update once i've sampled more of the menu :)",

Also, I think they might have taken on the comments from other reviewers, because the HH came in a baguette and that was lovely.   I'm thinking I should've got something beef though, because of other reviews and also there's a cow model next to the entrance and one coming out of the balcony above it?",

Same great service, same great wedges and plenty of seats available (for another Tuesday).  We also decided to sample more of the food menu.  Being coeliac I had fewer choices, but the waiters were really helpful (one has a mum who's coeliac so he knew his stuff).  I had the chilli cheese hot dog (with extra fries in lieu of the bun).  Excellent chilli (no kidney beans as that's not the proper way, apparently) served on the side because \"Chef wanted to make it nice since there is no bread\".  What a nice man!  Husband had the Huxley burger (no cheese).  He thought it reeeaaallllly good - just the right size, nice and juicy, with the bun an interesting, almost glazed thing rather than the usual flour/sesame atrocities that can be served in some places.  Plenty of fries for him, too.  For beer I stuck with a Kirin which is OK for me and when Husband said he wanted something different the waiter brought him two samples to try.  Nice touch.

After a Saturday full of shopping I was exhausted and easily coerced my boyfriend into going out for a few drinks.  I remembered the email I had received and The Huxley was on our way home.  They have a pretty good selection of beers on draught and and interesting cocktail menu - cocktails range from 6-7. I was really impressed the the staff! They were all very friendly (especially after one of us spilled a drink and consequently broke a glass).  After a few drinks and seeing other people around us eating we decided to order burgers.  I had the burger with blue cheese and bacon while my partner had chilli/Mexican one. Oh god! That burger was amazing. It was a smaller serving than what other gastropubs in Edinburgh serve but there were two patties on this one (see the picture I added).  The burger was well seasoned and was perfectly cooked.  I was and still am really impressed!    Note that the 25% all food runs until the end of the week I believe - check their website!  Well worth a visit!",

Located at the west end (beside all the never ending tram works) The Huxley has good beer and good banter and unlike the previous incarnation it doesn't become a ghost town after 8pm when the office workers head home.  The staff are friendly and fairly efficient, keeping the alcohol flowing and the tables clear of glassware. The hot dog I had was tasty, though the soup one of our party had looked to me to be on the small side.   The bar is nicely finished and as seems to be the trend the beer taps are fitted into the back wall, I used to find this odd as the staff have to turn their back on the patrons however it has the advantage of avoiding the crass plastic pumps that adorn most bars and seem to get bigger every year...  Overall then a good bar with decent beer and food alongside a good vibe, what is not to like.",

    "text": "I've only been to the Huxley for drinks but in general I'm a fan of it. It's near the office which is a major boon for it for a start.  They've restructures the old rutland bar and made it a much more usable space. Whereas before it was all big chairs and awkwardly high stools. They now have a more usable bar space which looks good to hang out at. A good waiting area if you're waiting to meet someone - this is really good for meeting people for business meetings. Before you had to hover uncertainly among the diners.   I think that I have a slight issue with the fact that the beers could have been done better. They have a FEW good taps and a couple decent bottles but I think they could have done more. It's also rather expensive.  We had some olive things with a sort of sauce. These were excellent although my friend ate most of them (he had paid for them)   I will update once I've been once more and perhaps bought some food.",

    "text": "Maybe Hustlers, not Huxley?   So, similar to Jurgen's statements below, this place creates a conflict of emotions in my mind that gives me a pain right behind my right eyeball. I have been a couple times and I just feel that for all the effort they are putting in, they are missing the final touches that would make this a commendable establishment. I really enjoyed its previous incarnation and was genuinely excited when I heard about this new concept.  So their premise is sound, a relaxed quality establishment that serves good value US style food and quality beverages, with the appropriate level of service - which is expected. This venue has always been synonymous with quality, well thought out concepts - see Kyloe upstairs for an example of how to get it right every time.   My problem here is that it doesn't really do what it says on the tin. The food is fine, not great, and reasonably priced - a frustration when you know the quality produce that is getting pounded out left right and centre on the 1st floor. The wine list and cocktails are relatively accessible, but certainly not setting my world on fire. The beer selection is AVERAGE, they have something like 10 pumps, and nothing overly exciting that you can't get in the majority of new boozers in town, the same goes for their bottled range.  The service is the part that makes this a well below par joint, and I know that will come as a surprise to a lot of people. I am ok if you want your team to be super cool, with trendy beards and tattoos all over the place, Timberyard pull it off without any effort whatsoever. But you need to make sure that these guys understand the basics of service. For example, if I order a beer at the bar and am told to take a seat and somebody will bring it over, then I don't expect it to take over 10 minutes to come. I also expect seasoned bar tenders to be able to deal with more than one order at a time. If you are offering table service, then make sure I get checked back on, and maybe offer me another beer before this one runs out, it's basic service. Finally, if you tell me I am ok to run a tab then make sure the bill is correct at the end of the night, my most recent visit was borderline attempted theft as the sheer volume of rogue drinks and 'double entries' on a bill which should have been a couple bottles of wine and a handful of pints was arguably more than just human error.  Like I said, a good concept, poorly executed.",

I wish my burger was a bit more cooked (some pink in the centre) but other than that no complaints. Also tried the irn bru sofa for the first time which tastes like an orange creamsicle.",

I had the eggs Benedict that were not very good in my opinion. It had a nice hollandaise sauce, but other than that the plate lacked flavours or any uniqueness. I had to return my first plate because the eggs were freezing cold- not the best start to a meal! My friend got the british breakfast and said it was very average. Unfortunately we had to wait such a long time because our meals came out at different times.   The staff were really awesome and accommodating throughout. They brought me a new eggs benny without hesitating as well as taking the coffees off our bill because of all the mix ups! They were also really apologetic which was nice.",

My current issues is with the loudness of the bar. It doesn't matter where I stand/sit I have to shout to get myself heard.  The other thing is the tables, the wooden type barrel top tables are nice to look at, but when you lean on them with any kind of fabric, they get stuck to the table. I found this out with one of my favourite jumpers, some of it may still be part of that table.   I understand these tables are not easy to clean, but it happens to be really sticky and that can't be the idea behind this.   So for that 1 star off.",

About a 10 minute walk from our hotel we noticed this lovely looking bar - they have a lot of smart and funky furniture including cow print chairs. It is very colourful inside - the benches are orange which adds a nice feel to the place. We ordered 2 full breakfasts which include tea or coffee. You get loads. The quality of the food was 1st class and would definitely recommend to try here for breakfast.  On our second day we was walking back to the Hotel and fancied a quick drink so decided to come back. Although serivce took a while for them to take our order we quickly received it once we had placed it. The beer was decent and seemed to be well kept. We tried the avocado wedges - deep fried avocado, which were excellent and something I have never seen before.",

The porridge is very tasty especially with the compote added. They don't have cinnamon powder. The smoked salmon and eggs were a good combo with the toast. The toast was very buttery though.  All was a very heart healthy breakfast. I wish the server a little more attentive to us. It took us a while to get her attention and to give us our check.

This is one of the closest bars to our office so 10 of us paid it a visit for lunch today after we were let down by The Hanging Bat.  It isn't vastly different to how it was when it was the Rutland but it is most definitely improved. We were all sitting in a comfy big booth out the way. We were surrounded by funny vintage signs for things such as 'nervous pills', which gave us plenty to look at whilst waiting for our food.  The menu is really interesting, there is a section of light bites which all sound delicious, such as haggis and a duck egg on toast with HP sauce. But I was starving and needed something more substantial and went for the Chicago hot dog. It was about 7 and was served with fries. They were nothing special but the hot dog was devine.   The staff were on top form, really friendly and keen to impress with the newly styled name and look. Overall, a definite improvement and i lovely place for a drink or bite to eat. Only thing is, they need to work on their promotion and their social media, customers are keen to talk so they should be open for some banter :)",
