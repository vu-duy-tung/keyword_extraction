    "text": "Definitely not the \"Mexican\" style food that I'm used to, but as far as getting a quick lunch for a good price - it's not bad!  I've found that Mexican food in the UK is sweeter and almost never spicy.  My husband got one of the burritos, and I got a small serving of nachos with no meat.  The staff is pretty friendly, the space is relatively clean, and once you get used to the lack of hot & spicy, the food is actually pretty good!  Even the small serving of nachos were quite a lot of food, and while I really enjoyed them, I couldn't eat the whole thing.  Good, casual, inexpensive lunch spot.",

    "text": "This place is close by and I decided to try them today.  Being a massive fan of both el cartel's and bodega's tacos, I was not expecting the same style or complexity, but I can not sanction a place that slaps food together. It's ok food, and it resembles tacos in shape, but it is such a miss when I a) come from Cali and b) know that even in Scotland tacos can be done right.   With a belly digesting food I can't say it was a waste, but I will not disappoint myself by returning and expecting something good. I likely won't return.",

    "text": "On the long, never-ending quest to find good Mexican in Edinburgh. The quest continues, but Taquito is a worthy contender. As a west-coast American my standards are high and my taste buds are picky. We have had a few decent meals here and there in this city, but nothing nails it. While Taquito might not put up much of challenge on the U.S. market, compared to the rest of the UK, it is pretty strong.   First, this place is just recently opened so it is still getting its bearings. The hours seem to be a bit hit and miss, as we have passed by several times, but only found them open this one instance. Hopefully that changes. The atmosphere is a bit sobering, definitely more of a take-away or quick bite, not a place for ambiance or romance. The staff (i.e. the one man who works there) was very friendly and the menu offerings are simple: burrito, burrito bowl (all fixings minus the tortilla), tacos, nachos. Meat options are simple as well: chicken, bbq pulled pork, beef barbacoa and  vegetarian. Simple really: pick your meat, pick your style, and done.   There are a few areas where this place shines. First, the tortillas seem fresh and perhaps homemade. If not homemade, they are definitely not of the bready, dry variety often found in UK Mexican joints. Second, they flat-grill the burrito after it is made, which served to give it some texture, give it added flavor, and hold it together. Next, they fill it up with all the extras unless your request otherwise. Also, they give you the option for SUPER spicy heat. We can take some killer heat, but pile on pico de gallo, green salsa, jalepenos, and habanero sauce and we were crying. No worries, they were happy tears. Finally, somewhere that can pack in the heat. If you dont like heat they can do it completely mild as well.   All this for bargain prices (just over 3 quid per burrito) makes Taquito a super option in the otherwise dreary Tollcross. If you have a Mexican craving and are up for a quick, cheap bite this place is worth a try.",

    "text": "Popped into here as wanted something quick and to try something new. The girl behind the counter was lovely and much like the idea of Chipolte - you pick what you would like and then add in the toppings! I opted for a small vegetarian burrito (with rice and beans) and my partner got the beef burrito. The large is enormous, so happy I got the small. The toppings you can add include - jalapenos, cheese, pico de gallo, sour cream, lettuce, guacomle for .50 extra and some hot sauces. I opted for medium and it was spice enough!  We also both asked for everything and were truly wondering if the lovely girl helping us could fold the burrito - as it was rammed full. Amazingly, she managed to wrap it and put it on the grill for a few minutes, they offer a small burrito and a soda for 5, so our meal was 10 for the two of us. It was hard to eat only because it was so massive - it was tasty and fresh - my only gripe being - the toppings weren't evenly spread through so at some stages I have salsa, and at others sour cream. But it tasted nice and was a good deal with good service! Just to note - they only have a table with 6 seats at it for community style eating if you opt to stay in, so best to takeaway as there might not be space. I wish I could give it 3.5 stars, it wasn't exactly the Mexican spices I would expect, but the service was nice and fast and the food fresh and tasty.",

    "text": "Let me clear something up straight away... Taquito is more of a Taco Bell rather than being Edinburgh's answer to Chipotle or Moe's. Now that that's out of the way...   I stopped in here for a quick bite at a cheap price... and that's exactly what I got. For just under 4 I had a decent chicken burrito and a canned fizzy drink. The burrito was good (for Scotland standards). While the chicken and rice were great, it could use some improvement on having more fresh ingredients. For example, I'm pretty sure the jalapenos (chills) were the kind from a jar, which is odd because I think fresh ones are actually cheaper than buying them in the jar. Also, I didn't notice much if any cilantro (coriander), which is one of the things that usually sticks out to me when I have fresh Mexican or southwest food. At any rate, I would by no means be planning to compare it with a burrito you might pick up in Mexico or the USA.   The service had much to be desired, but I must remind you that the window says \"Mexican Street Food.\" Taquito reminds me a lot of a taco truck that might be parked on the side of the street, and with that in mind the service is quite similar. They take your order, eventually ask for your money (which could be a few minutes later), and not really much to say other than that. it's actually a bit confusing when it comes to figuring out where to queue to order and also to wait for your order, so if it's a bit awkward you're not the only one.   There really isn't much seating. It's not the place for planning to sit down and enjoy a meal with friends. The seating suggests exactly what I believe is intended... either you're eating quick and then on your way, or your getting it takeaway. I was on my own and just wanted a quick lunch, so Taquito was perfect.   You may be wondering with my review why I've given it 4 stars. The reason for this is that you can be out the door for less 3.50-4.00 and when I compare that to what I could get elsewhere for the same price, it really can't be beat. Until Chipotle breaks out of London (and cuts their price in half), I'm happy to go to Taquito.",
