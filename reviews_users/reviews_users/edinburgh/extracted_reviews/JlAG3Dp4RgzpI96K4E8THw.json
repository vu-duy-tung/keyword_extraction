    "text": "Hmmmm.   Difficult one. Only used this place once and only ate from the Japanese (\"Wasabi\") menu.   The Mixed Vegetable Tempura was delicious and not greasy. The dip was great too.   The Veg Californian Sushi rolls were excellent. Accompanying pickle was outstanding. Plenty of wasabi paste too. Nom, nom, nom.   The Chicken Teriyaki was very tasty BUT the quality of the chicken meat was way off acceptable. Seriously substandard. It's expensive too. Over 9 for Chicken Teriyaki with butcher's floor meat?! Seriously?   Despite the tastiness & the enjoyment from the other dishes, the chicken has really put me off & I'm not sure I'd give it another chance. The Japanese menu is pretty expensive. If it was all good and consistent, I'd swallow the cost BUT since from my first experience, it really seems it isn't...",

    "text": "Known as Wasabi  I had an awful experience. I ordered from Just Eat and it took my order 1.5hrs to arrive  they charged 3 for delivery! By the time it arrived I wasn't in the mood for it. Sashimi looked lovely and tasted fine but not exactly mind blowing - tempura was soggy, cloggy and tasted horrid. I felt sick after eating the meal to be honest, I wouldn't ever go back here. If you want fantastic japanese then go to bonsai in Newington. It worries me that I've eaten food from a place with poor hygiene issues. That's one 15 I'm never going to see again. Avoid!!",

Great selection of sushi - everything from the more common salmon and tuna to the likes of eel, crab egg, octopus and scallop turn up here - and it is beautifully presented. I enjoy their miso soup too. Recommended.",
