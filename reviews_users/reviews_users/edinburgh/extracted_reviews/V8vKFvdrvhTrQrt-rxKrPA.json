You could have been anywhere in the world!  The whole place is really cool, it's designed well and it's easy to maneuver around. The food is good too - pretty standard really. I had chicken noodles in sweet chilli and my brother had chicken with leeks. He loved it, and so did I -albeit a little bit spicy. We had a bottle of red wine with our meal, and my chocolate brownie was the best I've ever tasted!! It all came to a grand total of 22 - we nearly choked! Turns out there was a 2 for 1 deal we had inadvertently signed up for.   It's a lovely place and I've been back several times since and never been disappointed!",

If I was reviewing it for food I would give it two stars as I wouldn't want to eat there again.  As I said, the drinks are good, nice selection, cool decor in the bar, lots of professional people hanging out there after work and a nice atmosphere.  I had dinner there one night on the two courses for 10 each offer and it was really hit and miss. My wife had an OK soup and a really nice chicken in honey mustard sauce for her main, I had a ropey spring roll and a not so great burger for my main. The burger patty itself was OK, nothing special but well cooked, but the bun literally fell apart in my hands when I picked it up and just made a mess everywhere. The side salad I got with it was very sparse and dry and didn't come with any dressing,  had to mix it with my wife's honey mustard sauce to make it edible.  I would go back for drinks if my friends were going, for food I'd give it a miss.",

We only had drinks, although people had eaten there on other occassions and spoke highly of the meals (and when boys wax lyrical about steak, you know it's worth going back for!).    Drinks were pleasant and it just felt like a really chilled out environment, even when a group of suits seemed to form an impenetrable wall to the bar. (They parted like the red sea when a very attractive young woman made her way to the bar!)    Eventually, the music did become a bit too loud to be able to have a conversation without shouting but this could have been where we were sitting - the accoustics in the very open main bar area are no doubt not as kind as the other areas of the restaurant.  There was something about the courtyard, though, that just had the right atmosphere and the couches outside are a great idea.  Full points for the design aspects!  A little on the pricey side but in keeping with many of the places in the same area and with a variety of beers on tap that aren't the usual suspects.",

    "text": "Loving Indigo Yard! At first I actually thought it was an extension to the back of Pizza Express...I know, I am blonde after all.  I like the atmosphere. It sort of feels relaxed and cool, and makes you feel relaxed and cool at the same time. The crowd is a bit of a mixture, from young uns to students to the more mature customer to couples, it has something for everyone.  As well as being a bar, it's also a restaurant, so you can have a little nibble with your Pinot Grigio. It isn't the cheapest place to drink though, a cocktail setting you back around 7-9, which means you could have a couple here then move onto somewhere a bit cheaper on a night out!  I recommend the Preston's Fizz, a new concoction I had never heard of before. It was a delicious mix of chambord, vodka and fresh raspberries over ice with some fizz to top it off. Yum!  A really funky bar!",

I had a traditional prawn cocktail for starter - was exactly what it said on menu. Nice juicy prawns and good seafood sauce. Main course was pasta with bacon and peas - nice big portion.

Greasy battered things, dry chicken resembling gum and bland mayo dip. I had the open mushroom lasagna for a main. It was tasteless and soggy, an absolute disaster which I ate 1/3 of. My partner had the \"crispy\" chicken and noodles which suspiciously tasted like Uncle Ben's sweet and sour sauce. Not good!  Neither of us finished our portions. The house wine was like drinking berry juice that had gone off. Needles to say, we did not order desert.",

However, a friend who'd recently moved away wanted to meet there for lunch and so I made the effort (not inconsiderable - it's hidden away behind and next to Pizza Express). It's quite a delight, after all. The first part of the premises is very light and airy and modern, then there are a series of pillars separating a dining-focussed area which is slightly dark and cosy. The food - 2 for 1 on lots of main courses - is excellent. So much so that I went back and shared one of their platters with my husband - a good selection of deliciously unhealthy food including tempura prawns, breaded chicken, etc. Well worth going back for! So, well worth making the effort to find, not only for the food and friendly staff but for the atmosphere.",

An eclectic mix of natural materials ranging from oak tables to the glass roof to the heavy stone walls, Indigo Yard pulses with vibe and atmosphere. The interior is subtly divided by walls and arches, with an upstairs balcony overlooking the lower level. The sleek furnishings, open spaces and sweeping bar add a fresh character and appealing buzz. Frequented by professionals and tourists alike, this bar is suitable as a starter for a night out or for a casual Sunday lunch. The food is delicious (the Mediterranean platter is a must have) and the drinks vary from wine to cocktails to coffee.

The bar is always busy and has a good atmosphere, particularly on a Friday night (don't expect to get a seat though as it's always packed). The food can be quite hit and miss - I've had some lovely meals but also had my fair share of burnt food so I wouldn't recommend coming here just for dinner.

After a pint of Best at the Jolly Judge and couple of pint of fun chased with little glasses of equally as much fun, we decided to head to Indigo Yard to seek out the banter. As we arrived we were greeted by a very jolly barman in a very bright and festive red shit. Immaculately ironed and buttoned right up to the top, he looked a million dollars and had one of the cheeriest faces I have ever seen. I was delighted that the bar had Best on tap and promptly ordered one along with a pint of tenants for my slightly less cultured friend. The Beers came in two small vases which gave the impression that this was indeed a fancy place to drink. All in all a slightly tacky establishment that's only real asset was the friendly barman, a definite asset. If I were to own such an establishment I would go to the ends of the earth to keep this jocular chap and would definitely consider increasing his salary to that of a renewable energy engineer.",

I probably have been at a lot of bad restaurants, but in this case it was amazing. The gin came a bit later and tasted very nice.   The servings of both the chicken and the gin was very good. Not too much and not too little.   From the Beginning the waitress, from Australia, was very nice and made everything possible for a late dinner. We enjoyed being served like that.  There were some minor negative things. The first thing was that the music was a little loud and after a while it was annoying, screaming at dinner. And the smoke from outside was coming into the restaurant itself, because people were smoking directly at the entrance.",

They also have a decent range of draft beers, however only one cider, and everything on tap is pretty expensive. I don't mind expensive, as long as the service justifies the cost of the drinks, which it didn't really to be honest. There were approximately five people behind the bar, and not that many people waiting for drinks but it was taking a relatively long time to be served, there seemed to also be a bit of an arrogance about some of the servers, no real chat, no conversational tones - which was a real shame. Needless to say, I can't really complain about the overall visit however if a thing or two went differently this review easily could have been 5 stars.",

    "text": "Went here for lunch recently with friends and really liked the atmosphere and decor.  We were sat in a comfortable booth and mostly chose things from the offer on the menu (I think it might have been 2 mains for 10).  Nik and I shared a starter as I was intrigued to try the wild mushrooms on sun-dried tomato toast.  This was very nice but I was a bit disappointed as the toast we received was actually just rustic wholemeal (although still tasty).  We both had the burger as our main course and they were delicious!  Well cooked, nicely seasoned and juicy but with crispy edges.  I also liked the accompaniments and drinks we chose.  I had a blueberry smoothie and fizzy water.  I loved the glasses they were served in too!  Dessert was a bit more of a let down.  We all ordered hot chocolates as they sounded amazing (made with melted chocolate, not powder) and we all chose the double chocolate one rather than the more unusual rose & black pepper or lemongrass & white chocolate.  We also paid the extra for macarons on the side (even me as I wanted to take them home) and I ordered the mulled cherry rice pudding as it sounded too good to miss!  My rice pud came first, served in a kilner jar it was nice and hot and very tasty.  The cherries were lovely with a hint of spices and just enough tartness against the sweet, creamy rice pud.  Unfortunately our hot chocolates took ages to arrive and some of them were barely warm when they did come.  I'd already finished my pudding and our macarons were served first so we had waited patiently only to be disappointed.  The other weird thing was that we all agreed they tasted spicy - like chilli chocolate.  When I questioned our waitress about this she asked the guy who'd made them and we saw his incredulous reaction as he exclaimed \"Chilli?!?\"  Apparently, they were just plain chocolate but since all four of us tasted a kick, we have no idea where that came from.  I'm glad it wasn't just me going mad!  Our first server was much more efficient and capable than our second.  The macaron flavours we all chose were quite mixed up and some had to be changed as she'd forgotten what we asked for.  She seemed a bit confused at times and we were worried about asking about the hot chocolates.  I sent mine back as I wasn't enjoying it, even if I was given another hot one I wouldn't have liked it.  Given the time we'd spent waiting, I didn't want to order another hot drink as everyone would be waiting and as I said, I'd already finished my pudding.  She was quite insistent that she could bring me another but eventually accepted that I really didn't want one.  My hot chocolate was taken off the bill and I was allowed to keep my macarons so that did make up for some of the disappointment.  Overall, it was good value for money.  Lara's starters (she had 2 starters instead of a main) were particularly good value as the portions were huge and looked delicious!  I would go back again as the issues I've mentioned above were only minor and we did enjoy the food.",

    "text": "I was pretty excited about this place cause the website is awesome. It looked like a trendy, hip, fun and happenin place to eat dinner so I told my friend to meet me there for dinner. I tried making a reservation via online but it didn't work so I called and they took it for me.   The place is a bit hard to find cause, but it's next to pizza express on queen ferry st ln. The restaurant is pretty trendy and have twigs with lights everywhere. The bar is spectacular with all the beers and wines showcased. It was pretty dead on a Monday night, so truthfully I think you can come here without a reservation anytime during the week. I can see it getting packed on the weekends.   Ok so let's talk about the food. The menu was pretty good, a wide array of choices. They have a dinner deal- a starter + main meal for just 10! What's more exciting is the several types of Mac n cheese they made. I did the dinner special... Got chicken with polenta cake for the starter and salmon with some sauce and veg. The  starter was blah... The chicken was way overdone making it dry, hard and chewy. Polenta cake was ok, mushy at best. The salmon was actually pretty cool decently... Not like the chicken but really needed salt or some kind of seasoning because the sauce that came with it did not do it justice. The only amazing this about the food was their Mac n cheese! I kidd you not, if you end up here just get the Mac n cheese and you're good to go! I got the apple cheddar with become, AMAZING! It was full of cheese, not dry, and well seasoned. I'd come here just for that and alcohol.   The staff were slow. You had the bar tender playing around with the mixer and the waiters disappeared in the back so as much as I wanted to order dessert... waiting for at least 30 minutes of just sitting dinner after my main course, I just told the bar tender to give me bill so I can go... Forget the dessert! I should have known this would have happened cause from the other yelp review I read... One of their main complaints was the slow... Slow service!  Truthfully of only come back here for the Mac n cheese and if I was around the area to get a drink. I wouldn't come back for the food, although the it was pretty cheap.",

    "text": "Sigh ... what Helen C said (we were together at the time). Perhaps a one-off or just bad luck with the waiter, considering everywhere else we went in Edinburgh had top notch service, prices and food, and other reviewers seem to love it. Aside from what Helen already pointed out, we had to remind the server that my order came with juice and coffee, and even then the OJ never showed up. Had subbed out an extra hasbrown for the haggis, when we pointed out that my order had no extra anything (but was missing the haggis and black pudding as requested) he set it down in front of me anyway and rushed off. Came back about 15 mins later with a bowl full of hasbrowns ... like six in the bowl. It felt weirdly passive aggressive. Also it was the only thing that showed up warm.",

    "text": "Third visit to the Indigo Yard. Well a few couple a months since the last. I never had a meal here (yet) but the ambiance is second to none! It is like being outdoors indoors. Dim lighting and a lot of wood. Stone floor with red brick walls. I feel like I am in a courtyard with a balcony overlooking the place below. If you can just imagine a Mediterranean restaurant on the beach. It is close to dusk. Low candlelight and stars overlook the place. You sit in one of the corner sofas. And a low funky beat is playing in the background. You order a beer which is served promptly and the waitress asks if you are comfortable. Oh yes! Very!   That is what it feels like. On top of that you have free wifi and delicious bar snacks.  What I do find funny is that the bar is ever so slightly higher than you usual get. It makes you feel like a small child asking for sweets at a counter. However in this case I was asking for beer. Yes they have Asahi on draft!   One drawback though. The place is expensive. Oh yes! Very! That is the reason I don't visit so often. I would like to, but it does break the bank after 3 pints! The aforementioned Asahi is 4.60  I will come back - just to feel good. Would I stay a whole night?  No. 3 stars due to the prices.",

Indigo Yard has a great selection of ales, beers and lagers... but is not the place to get booze-hammered though, unless you are willing to re-mortgage you second home.  The place was very busy with families, groups of office parties and the usual suspects, adding colour, diversity and happiness to the joint. Will certainly go back to taste the food and filter more of that Cornish Pilsner. Recommended.",

    "text": "Ah, Indigo. In difficult times for businesses everywhere, Indigo has been a sturdy shelter from the storm, a constant go-to in the west end of Edinburgh for bustling food and evening-time drinks or a cheeky swift coffee or longer lunch during the day.  Indigo Yard doesn't move with what's fashionable - I don't think it needs to. Once you've found a certain way of doing things that works, and has consistently worked, then that's it, you become a longstanding feature that people will keep coming back to. I'm not sure how many years Indigo has been open...over ten years anyway? But yes, there's really only a simple point to be made here - if you're in the west end with not a lot of time, and decisions to be made over getting that big glass of white wine you've been dreaming of all day alongside decent bar food that'll hit the spot, Indigo will be there for you, and you'll get the buzzing atmosphere thrown in too.",

We were a large group who had booked a month in advance but they were totally unprepared for our party, even though the rest of the place was pretty quiet. The waiter came across quite rude at times and generally acted like he couldn't be bothered. Not a complete disaster as others enjoyed their breakfasts but overall felt this could have been a more pleasurable visit.",

    "text": "having only been here for a quick drink once before, i was quite looking forward to going on a work night out this past friday.  Indigo Yard is quite a cool place and clearly a spot for a post work friday night drink.  it's a big open space (atrium like) with brick walls and a sort of industrial chic look.  there is a mezzaine area with tables for those sitting to for a meal but also a back room for diners as well.  on arriving, i joined my co-workers at a table near the entrance for a drink before a couple of us sat down for dinner.  we seemed to have come on a great night as an Edinburgh Gin rep was there passing out free samples of their gins.  so massive thumbs up from me as Edinburgh Gin is a serious favourite for me, especially the raspberry and the elderflower varieties!  they also have a spiced orange coming out :)  after a drink, 7 of us sat down to eat in the back room and the menu looked good.  they offer a fabulous deal of 2 courses for 10 all week, with a good selection of items from their main menu.  we all went for the deal as it was too good to pass up and i had a chicken caesar salad to start with followed by salomn teriyaki over noodles.  the salad was quite tasty, but rather simple so hard to judge the place on just that.  however, my salmon was also quite nice and a reasonable portion (not too big or too small).  oddly enough even though the menu said it came over noodles the salmon was served over rice.  which was fine, but not sure why the menu was wrong....  back to the bar for some more drinks after our meal which included music from a live band playing popular songs.  it set quite a nice vibe and i have to say i really enjoyed my night here.  but i can't give this place four stars, the drinks are so expensive!!!  i got a double gin and tonic at one point at it was 8.80!!  i was a bit stunned as this seemed quite high, but all of their cocktails also come in at or above the 8 price tag.  a spirit and mixer is around 5 as well, so definitely nothing cheap here! so sadly while i really enjoyed this place and will be back, i'll need to save up my pennies for a bit first as my bank account is feeling rather low after my night out....",

    "text": "It's Sunday, the day after the night before which incorporated bizarre cocktails, far too many pre-going out amarettos and Coronas and a rock club that doubled as a time machine, transporting you backwards exactly nine or ten years. You've got work again tomorrow and you're in for a three hour plus rail journey that afternoon. What do you need? AWESOME FOOD!  But what's better than awesome food? Awesome food available on a two for one basis in a really pleasant place. Now I'm assured that when this spot gets busy it does become far less serene and more bustling and jostling, and that tends to be during the post-office hours when the suits descend upon it like buzzards to some poor lost soul in the desert. On this quiet Sunday, however, its tranquility was just what the doctor ordered.  I grabbed myself a goat's cheese salad and Mr M opted for the ribs. Now, you know by now I'm not some frou-frou twee low fat type who likes a lettuce leaf and a bit of rabbit food. I want my salads to be proper, big and substantial and meal-like, and this was indeed all of the above. Check my photo for evidence - gargantuan hunk of crusty bread topped with a huge slab of goat's cheese, balsamic dressing with fresh cherry tomatoes and rocket... heaven. It beat me, I couldn't even finish the thing. And those ribs were insane, once again check the pics for visuals. Can't argue with the portion sizes here!  The desserts look amazing too. So, that's money-saving potential, hefty food plates, a TV with some kind of bike race on it, lovely friendly service and very nice decor? Thumbs up all round, methinks.",

On one hand I enjoy it as a bar, particularly in the summer after work or on a Saturday afternoon (its predominently an 'office worker' style clientel). The outdoor seating has been a welcome addition, allowing you to enjoy a glass of something chilled in the evening sun! Then when it gets chilly head inside to enjoy a cocktail or two as the after work vibe picks up.. Def a good place to start on a Thurs or Fri evening!  Part of the bar is separated into a restaurant area... This is where I've been disappointed! Part of the Montpeliers group there are regularly deals on lunch or evening meals such as 2 for 10 which definitely pulls in custom, including me. It's just a pity that the quality of the food can be a hit or a miss.. It's not that it's bad per se just that I wouldn't necessarily pay full price for it! Such a shame as the menu has plenty to tempt you - my friends and I recently opted for the sirloin steak and out of four only one was cooked as requested and the chunky chips were disappointedly dry n tasteless :(",

None of the food is good for you, which doesn't bother me in the slightest but my more \"aware\" friend was getting a bit antsy. We stayed for a drink after and it was how can I put it - just alright. The bouncer letting big groups of lads in was probably a mistake as it was filled with rugby sorts being a bit obnoxious, which turned a nice supper into a bit of an annoyance.",

The first visit was with a friend, we took advantage of a two course for 10 deal which was excellent value. The seabass and cheesecake i ordered were tasty and a good size.Despite the noisy exterior,(it certainly is a booze after work kid of place0 we had a comfortable table and the talk and our conversation was not drowned out bu the music as other reviews had warned me.  The Second visit was with a group off 22 girls(a well behaved hen party).When we arrived we had booked with the intent of partaking another two course deal but sadly the one we had seen advertised two days before was no longer running and we had not been informed of this on booking. My starter of mussels was a good size and my main of sundried tomato ravioli was enormous and defeated me easily (although we were filling up on the extensive cocktail menu..)  Service was slightly slow but given how busy the venue was and the size of our party this was only to be expected. We were there for the live music this time which definitely kept the atmosphere going well into the evening. Overall I would say Indigo Yard is worth visiting especially if they are running one of their promotions on food, otherwise it's quite expensive. The staff are friendly, efficient and I would certainly return, particularly in a large group.If it's a weekend, one piece of advice , be sure and book!",
