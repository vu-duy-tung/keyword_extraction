    "text": "I love sushi. No two ways about it.  I never always loved sushi, on account of not liking fish. As it turns out, I don't like fishy fish. You know, the strong fish flavour that makes you want to gag?   It also turns out that raw fish doesn't taste like fishy fish as one might expect, and it's also incredibly delicious! So now I love sushi. And I do love Bonsai.   I've been to this particular location about a dozen times now and all but one visit were lovely.   The staff are very hands off, they take your order promptly, deliver the food and see whether you want any more drinks (typically). They are also pretty friendly.  The food is always prepared fresh and it's generally really good quality. There is a good selection and a specials board that offers some more exotic things that I wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole (squid!) I particularly like the California and the Rainbow rolls. I'm still pretty tame when it comes to sushi.  The last day I went wasn't my best experience. It was a lunch time around Christmas and the place was virtually dead...I think there was one other couple there. The waitress was really friendly, however was a bit too hands off when our drinks were empty for some time. Also it seemed that anyone who worked it the place disappeared for 15 minutes, and it was just me and my dining companion wondering if we've entered a time warp.   Regardless the only thing I took particular offence to were the scallops on my sashimi (I think it's called). They were really squidgy and gross. I was very disappointed and couldn't finish one (out of 2!) roll. I have had better scallops from there, so I have faith. Just that day, not so much.",

I ordered the umeboshi (waaaaaa!!! PICKLY!), six salmon and cucumber maki, and two red pepper nigiri, which altogether came to 10.50. Because the maki come in sixes, I think the best way to do it is to go in a group and order a bunch of stuff between you rather than just get one type each.  The umeboshi were super-pickled in that face-twistingly sour way - yum! The nigiri and maki were spot on - fresh-tasting, good cohesive rice, sweet and filling. I loved the weeny wasabi rolled into a little teensy blob-ball on the side of my nigiri. Too cute! That little green globe is going to be all I can think of when I hear the words \"wasabi pea\" from now on.  Being technical, I really should give this place three stars, because it's A-OK and I had a fine time here - but it gets a fourth star mostly for the gorgeous manga on the wall. Also, the benches are comfy to sit on.",

    "text": "I signed up to yelp after having sushi here yesterday. I'm a food lover but really felt after trying this place I wouldn't want a single person to waster their money eating here.   To start with the positive the waitress was lovely - very friendly and attentive. She also gave me food recommendations and was generally really nice.  Now onto the food... I ordered a selection of sushi rolls, a seaweed salad and miso soup to take away. After trying the first piece of sushi it was evident that this was the worst sushi I'd ever tasted - it was tasteless, the fish was really bad quality and it was over priced! The whole thing came to over 30.   To top it off they'd not bothered or asked if I'd like any soy sauce, wasabi or ginger so this was completely left out of my bag for the take away. Surely this is a standard thing to put with sushi!  I really wish I'd had a better experience and I'd also chose supporting an independently run restaurant over a chain establishment but I would definitely not recommend coming here.",

    "text": "Being completely untrained to all that is sushi, my level of experience rested between \"Tesco/Sainsbury's\" and \"Is that the one with the peppers in it or the meat?\" so it was safe to say when I went along to this restaurant I knew I wasn't going to have a clue about anything that was on the menu.  Thankfully a few of the good people I had with me knew what was going on and without embarrassing myself I was able to pick up the way the menu worked and what was supposed to happen.  Having ate a 2ft baguette (don't ask) for lunch I decided I would take it easy so I ordered the salmon maki and the tuna maki and both were lovely. Most of the maki is served in 6's so, as Cressi pointed out, the best way to visit this place would be in a group and have everyone order a few different dishes.  I tried a bit of everyone's and all were wonderfully prepared (and in a few cases cooked). They tasted fresh, sometimes sweet and perfectly filling. Forgive my ignorance on the spelling and pronunciations of the dishes, but I can vouch for what I tried that it was lovely.  If I could take a moment to bow my head in praise for the wasabi and pickled ginger, at one time I had tears come to my eyes with the initial heat of the wasabi that was rolled beautifully in to a little ball, which of course means it is made right and isn't that funny pasty stuff you get in the supermarket packs.  Perfectly welcoming little restaurant if you fancy a small evening out of throwing a few tables together and going in a group. Bonsai has definitely encouraged me to try all the local sushi bars in Edinburgh.",

Just because i would choose other cuisines over it - nothing against sushi at all.  If I'm on Broughton Street, it's usually in the day time and I usually pass this place without really thinking about it.    It has a few tables at front and at the back of the premises.  The decor is red and black.  I choose the \"dragon\", which has eight pieces of rice roll with a tempura prawn, avocado and something creamy on top.  It was nice and worked well with the thinley cut slices of ginger and I had alot of ginger.  To top if off i could not resist the scallop - nigiri-zushi (2pieces) seasoned rice with topping.  I love scallop and this is my cup of tea.  I had a taster of Cressi's ordered a portion of pickled plums and offerend us to try. Boy .... that made me make some faces! Way too sour for my tougue!  I loved the pork dumplings and the pancake type almost like an tortilla - quite delish too.  I might give sushi more of a try in the future as I like fish and the rice is a nice filler.",

A bit cosy for our party of 5 but we managed and the food was lovely. I had the prawn tempura (the prawns were huge), gyoza pork, which was nice and something else the name of which I can't remember.  I opted for the Kiri beer which was the only thing I didn't like, but I'd never tried it before and wasn't to my taste, can't mark the place down for that; it was a gamble that didn't pay off. I'll have a Sapporo next time.   The highlight had to be the banana tempura dessert, though. I'm not normally a fan of cooked fruit but this was just amazing.  The whole lot (3 dishes, a beer and a desert) cost me a very reasonable 21. Worth every penny.",

The lunchtime specials are great value with a Sushi selection, bowl of miso soup for 4.90. Great to have a cheap and tasty japanese in the north of Edinburgh. Highly recommended!",

Leith has been crying out for a suchi restaurant for ages and now I can have my sushi fix this end of town. Yarrr!   Wandered in here around 9ish for a table and the place was resonably busy for a Friday night, I am guessing that this will be short lived and once more people are aware of this place then it will be bookings only on Friday nights very soon. The decor is great, contemporay asian I guess with a few antiques placed here and there. The friendly waiter showed us to our table and made sure we knew what we were ordering etc, which I thought was great as many of my friends are intimidated by Japanese food so someone willing to go over the menu was nice.   This time round I didnt order any of the meat or fish dishes my dining partner for the evening is veggie so I though lets get an array of things we can both eat. Everything was excellent and served quickly. The list of food we ordered is below:  agenasu - aubergine with chilli miso sauce   avocado & red pepper maki  vege tempura - in a light crispy batter with soy broth   vege california -  egg, avocado, cucumber, mayo & sesame  okonomiyaki - traditional Japanese vegetable pancake (Never tried this before but it was excellent)  All in great service, amazing food and nice atmosphere... we had a great meal out.",

In fact I strongly believe that this place deserves its rating of 4,5 stars, the food is awesome and the prices are good enough, if one utilises the lunch or the box deals.   Yet today I decided -unfortunately- to go there for dinner, for my first time, and the service was horrible. There was only one poor girl running around for more than 10 tables inside and outside and I waited for 40 minutes just to order and exactly an effing hour to eat. They should just hire another waiter for the evenings or remove some tables but that situation today was unacceptable, thus the -1 star in the rating and my recommendation against visiting Bonsai for dinner in case you are hungry, even more now that the festival is approaching.

We arrived later than usual dinner time (around 8pm) and ordered just some tap water for drinks - the waitress said she would wipe the table for us first... Though she went and got the waters and then proceeded to wipe other empty tables before ours (just strange)?  At about 8.10pm we ordered the mixed plate of sashimi, tempura prawn sushi rolls and the teriyaki salmon with steamed rice. And then we sat and waited. And waited. And waited. We received no apologies (nor did the surrounding tables), no top ups for our water or anything - we were just ignored. It seems that they did not consider to bring dishes out as entrees, the whole front of the restaurant was served in a very slow succession of tables which made it so painfully predictable to watch. After 45 minutes I wanted to leave, but we knew that we would just have to wait again at one of the surrounding restaurants - and we were still clinging to the idea that it would be there soon...  When our order was finally placed on our table at 9.19pm after over an hour of waiting we were not excited. We had what seemed to be mini size sushi rolls (which looked okay with the avocado on top but the tempura prawns inside were cold), two flat skinny pieces of teriyaki salmon (which tasted very fishy and were only hot on the side touching the cast iron serving plate that was sitting in a pool of very watery sauce), a small bowl of sushi rice (that was cold and stuck together) and a limp plate of sashimi which included 4 micro size prawns (honestly never seen such small prawns), two halves of one scallop and then 2 pieces each of tuna, salmon and another fish which was okay.  Honestly by the end I just couldn't believe we sat there and waited all that time for such a disappointing meal and experience. I understand what it's like to work in a busy hospitality establishment and maybe the kitchen was really short staffed or something - but it was the combination of the crappy service and average meal for 23.50 that left more than a bad taste in our mouths... Not a great way to end our trip to Edinburgh, but atleast our hotel has free cookies for dessert.",

I've been 3 times already - once for dinner and twice for lunch. The menu is the same as the Pleasance  - not the most adventurous nor expansive sushi list but a good variety of maki, nigiri, sashimi, rolls and hand rolls together with other 'hot'  favourites such as teppanyaki and okonomiyaki. The lunch deal is fantastic - about a fiver for miso soup and a set choice of 6 or 7 things including a sushi set. Bargain. It's not big, it's not clever but it is tasty and exceptional good value. Service is friendly and quick as well. I will be a frequent lunch time visitor.",
