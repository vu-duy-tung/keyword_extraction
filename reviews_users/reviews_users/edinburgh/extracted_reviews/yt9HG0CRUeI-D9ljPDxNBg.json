    "text": "I was up at Edinburgh as part of my visit to the city, Found this cafe as there was a man outside with a sign who kindly directed me its location. Once inside was warmly greated but all members of staff inside the building where it was located. Order fish and chips with a coffee, food was amazing and coffee was up to scratch, if I didn't know where I was I would have thought it was just as good as Starbucks. Food well cooked everything was clean and fresh. Highly recommended to anyone in area. 5/5 for me.",

    "text": "We went to this cafe because we had some time to kill before going back to London. Utterly disgusting, the tables were filthy and my wife had a panni, but it wasn't even warm and the bread was stale. My son just had a bacon roll, which was fine but the drink he took from the chiller was out of date my a week.  I just had a coffee which was nothing special but was okay. All in all I would avoid the place if you want to have a nice time, there are many other, much nicer cafes around Edinburgh that offer quality food and lovely service",
