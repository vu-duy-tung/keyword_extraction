    "text": "As part of my graduation week, I had the privilege of attending a variety of restaurants I normally can't afford. Apart from Sweet Melindas, I also went to the Apartment, which is in Tollcross right next to Barclay Viewforth Church. It's a pretty teensy restaurant, but the tables aren't very crowded and the furniture all looks like it's been carved with care.   The staff can take banter, and always with a smile. It's clientele is generally quite easy-going and casual: mostly young adults, though there are the occasional children. With my participation, there were also a few parents and grandparents.   The food was mouthwatering; the menu was pretty modern, but not too outrageous. The vegetarian options were alright, but not to die for. As a former meat-eater, though, I can gauge just by look and smell, how good the food must taste. And the service was prompt to boot!  When I was there, we got the chance to be star-struck by Ewen Bremner, Spud from Trainspotting, THE film about Edinburgh (apart from Hallam Foe), though I haven't really experienced the heroin-side of the city.   Great place to have a meal if you've got a bit o' money to spare.",

    "text": "The Apartment is a little off the beaten track (especially if you're in Edinburgh for the festival) but the food is consistenly outstanding, and although sometimes the service can be variable, it is worth it for the food.  It's also in a really nice location, because if you get a table by the window you can watch the traffic going by on Bruntsfield Place - as a big people watcher I love that!  For the food, teh menu is a little unusual in the sense that it is not laid out as strarters, mains etc.  They have Chunky Healthy Lines (CHLs) which are kebab type things served with salad and pita, Fish Things, Other Things and Salad Dishes.  We had the merguez sausage, mussels and of course plenty of the yummy garlic fries.  Definitely recommend, just be prepared for slightly too cool for school wait staff!",

About 45 minutes later, we were seated at a table that did not have enough place settings or chairs for our party. Due to lack of space, we ended up sharing chairs. Once seated, we found out that the restaurant was already sold out of three of the main courses. After we ordered, it took almost an hour to get our food. All that being said, the food was delicious. Everyone loved what they got. The sides of garlic fries and sweet potato spears really stand out as being great.   Though the night wasn't pleasant, the food was great. I probably would never return to the restaurant with a large party, but I would go there again if it was just two of us.",

I went here for my leaving night meal, bringing 7 mates along and was relieved to see everyone liked the place and 'got' its approach to dining.   Firstly, they do starters a little bit differently. Instead, you order a larger dish for 2-4 people and everyone digs in. This works well, with the French-Moroccan influence on the cuisine suiting everyone.   The staff are young, cool and invariably attractive. At first they might seem a little aloof, but I found everyone was polite and helpful if asked directly. I really appreciate honest service, so when I asked for a waiter's opinon of a certain wine, it was refreshing to hear, Don't have that one, this one's much better.   The restaurant is moodily lit, with gentle beats in the background that can expose a few nodding heads or tapping feet. It all feels very chic and if you enjoy a bit of panache with your mash (sorry) you'll find yourself making regular stops.",

Its certainly one of my favourite places in Edinburgh for a meal, I like the way that the menu is set out where starters are also main courses, which can give a more social way of eating, go with a few friends and I suppose it could be like a posh version of pick and mix. I would certainly say that the menu offers something for everyone and I love the beetroot coleslow.",

The portion is also big for a starter so it is good value.   I had the hake as main.  Again, the portion is big which is what I am happy about.  However, it was a tad bland and I don't think the fish was that fresh as there was a bit of an unpleasant fishy smell.   My friend had the salmon but she also thinks that her fish was also on the bland side.    I think this is a good establishment but I think they need to go back to basics and taste their food along to the way before serving it.  Definitely room for improvement.",

We found it difficult to find somewhere in the area that wasn't a coffee shop or pub that served food after 2.30pm so this was perfect! It wasn't too busy and the service was really good - the waitress always made sure we had enough water and took our orders fairly quickly.   We started with 2 starters to share - whipped goats cheese with beetroot and walnuts and scallops with clams, carrots and prosecco. Both were really lovely and good portion sizes.   For my main I went for the lunch deal which was a flat iron steak, chips, grilled tomato and a glass of wine for 10. The steak was cooked the way I like (medium rare) but was slightly chewy - this is probably my only negative. I asked for garlic chips (anything with a garlic option is up my street) and they were AMAZING!!! It's probably quite sad to rave about chips, but these skinny fries were great (then again I am most definitely a skinny chip over chunky chip kinda gal).   The rest had a variety of things - mussels in a pancetta and white wine sauce (good portion size and sauce was yum), hake with pancetta and veg (she seemed happy and finished quickly so I'm guessing that's a good sign) and pork belly with chorizo jam (quite a small portion size, it was on the set menu, but the pork cooked very well).   We probably didn't need dessert but went for it anyway - a wee sharing platter of mini desserts. I didn't eat much and focused on finishing my glass of wine (priorities).   All in all a really nice visit and would definitely go back - v close to the cameo so handy for there!",

Really great Modern European food in an upscale yet casual bistro environment. Unlike the insanely busy The Outsider, The slightly off-beat location of the Apartment results in a quieter and more relaxing environment. On a recent Sunday night The Apartment was busy but not crowded.  As for the food---do get the bread, even though it's extra it's well worth it. I had the lamb for my main which came with sweet potato mash. I also elected to get a side order of the spinach and green beans, which was simply perfect. My friend ordered one of CHL (Chunky Healthy Lines) which while not as artistically pleasing, was absolutely massive and quite tasty apparently.

An airy modern interior with interesting large artwork.   It is in a beautiful little neighbourhood near The Meadows - a large park in Central Eburgh with frequented by strollers, dog walkers, and even a free golf pitch and putt. (For North Americans who have never seen such a thing, it's a section of the park, dedicated to golf practice, but the distances are too short for long drives, you have to shag your own balls, and avoid beaning passersby and avoid getting beaned yourself.)  Returning to the Apartment, I enjoyed a wonderful roast lamb - rare and tender, with root vegetables and garlic roasted fingerling potatoes. As an appetizer, the bread and mixed olives were so good, there was no need to look further.  Full from dinner, there was no room for dessert, but I did sneak in one tiny, perfect single malt from the newly discovered (by me) Springbank Distillery in Camptelltown in southern Kintyre.",

Again the look is trendy but it is much less crowded than the Outsider.  Outside of us there are no tourists.  The slow night meant the waiter really gave us the view of the various choices and also had time to talk football with my son.  My son had the duck breast; I chose the saltwater bream.  Both came with various vegetables prepared just so and beautifully displayed on the plate.  Again we thought Inkill & Gunn was the perfect beverage.  For dessert we split a chocolate pave, a super chocolatey flour less cake.  As they say in the UK, it was brilliant.  Who tricked Americans into thinking that Scots only eat haggis, neeps and tatties? Perhaps some clever Scot wanted to keep the tourists out of the excellent restaurants of Edinburgh.       The Apartment and its sister The Outsider are excellent and good value for the quality of the food, the service and  the ambience.",

    "text": "Came here for an early dinner pre my saturday night roller disco. Yes.... A roller disco!!   We fancied bistro type food over any other and as we were in Tollcross already I suggested The Apartment. I opted for the pre theatre menu of 2 dishes for 10 while both my friends ordered the chicken and prawn kebabs from the main menu. My main and dessert worked out cheaper than their kebabs which were about 14 each!   I had the confit of duck leg with squash. I love confit of duck so was a bit disappointed with the soft, rubbery skin on the leg which i had to peel away and plop on the side of my plate. It should have been crispy! :( However underneath the meat was soft and fell off the bone as it should. And although I don't like squash, I ate it and actually found the whole thing quite pleasing. I don't like places where you have to order chips or veg separately but given my meal was so cheap I didn't mind paying the extra for some fries. They came heavily salted though - now I like salt but boy were they salty!!  The kebabs didn't particularly look presented well in my mind but they got a thumbs up from my friends for the taste. Not anything special but just 'nice'. A bit expensive perhaps for what you got. I also felt the bottle of prosecco was edging on overpriced at nearly 27. No need.   The lunch and pre-theatre menu is extremely good value but I can't bring myself to rate above 3 for this visit. The service was ok as was the food but nothing to write home about. Shame, as it used to have an excellent reputation.",

    "text": "I hadn't been to The Apartment for over a year but on walking down to Tollcross earlier, I was tempted by the two courses for 10 advertised.  The offer is 2 courses for 10 or 3 for 13. The menu is small but only 1 out of each course wasn't suitable for gf which was great.   I find The Apartment a strange venue. Quite huge high ceilings and they've gone for a modern look with dark grey walls. Nice surroundings I guess but it does feel cold, especially if it is quiet and location wise I think it is suffering.  The food was good. I wasn't wowed but the 2 courses for 10 was good and I'd probably take advantage of this again.   My venison was nice - haunch of venison with plums and walnuts. Nice with a french style dressing so not wow but good enough. I did enjoy my main of beef cheek with wilted spinach and duck fat roast potatoes. These were more potato cubes but still tasty and the beef cheeks were tender and melt in the mouth.   So a nice Monday treat which suited my budget though I'm not sure I'd be paying full price.",

    "text": "As many people have said, this place is reminiscent of The Outsider (though one of the first things an employee told us was that they werent associated with The Outsider?). Anyway, the menus are very similar, but The Apartment is a bit smaller and cozier.   Service and atmosphere were nice. Beer and wine selection were OK. Where it faltered a bit was with the food. We both thought our appetizers were quite good (fish and egg risotto, duck and fig salad), but the mains left a lot to be desired. Boyfriends pork loin was just a bit bland and flavorless, with a lot of fat. My chicken and prawn skewers were nice and very big portion, but also lacked a lot of flavor. I feel like salt and seasoning was missing. Without any kind of seasoning or sauce, the skewers just ended up a bit bland. I was also unsure of what to do with the HUGE portion of beet/cabbage salad served on the side.   Overall it was a perfectly decent meal, it just didnt wow us. Was very similar to what we had at The Outsider and would be a safe option for dinner any night of the week, we were just hoping for a bit more.",

Didn't think of it at the time... but ordered pretty much the same dish as I did back in 2001 - monkfish skewers with beetroot coleslaw.  A thousand times improvement tasted.  Guys well done and keep up the good work.  Nice decor and friendly service too.",

The reason to not say yes is because it shows up on your bill unannounced and over priced for the quality.  The food was ok.  The building's modern design is fun but cold.  The wine list was good, and the risotto balls are recommended.",

    "text": "The Apartment Bistro in Bruntsfield has always held warm memories for us and I have been  many times and have never had a bad time or bad meal within its trendy walls. I was therefore rather surprised, but pleased to get a table at The Apartment last minute on Friday night.  Our experience revealed why, as sadly, despite a good meal (the food is great, although the new funky seasonal menu is gone and the beetroot coleslaw has returned) The Apartment seems to have lost its soul - there was no atmosphere, the place was half empty, there was no buzz.   I don't know what has happened; maybe in training the staff better they have broken its heart, or maybe dressing the place up as mutton they have driven their customers away. Whatever it is I hope they can settle on what the place is soon, it is my local restaurant and I want it back!",

    "text": "I recently reviewed the consistently very decent Apartment restaurant, however, on returning there for a meal this week for the first time in a wee while, I realised it had gone through somewhat of a refurb after ten years of faithfully serving up the famous Chunky Healthy Lines to Tollcross/Bruntsfield diners. The Apartment's sister restaurant, The Outsider, still includes these delicacies on the menu, so the newly made over Apartment now sports a different menu and a different look.  The understated, modern trendiness of the interior still remains, but new additions include an awesome array of different lights, which were both contemporary and edgy, plus raised ceilings and a mirror that kind of looked like it had a skyscraper design imprinted on it. Some might call it French vintage looking shabby chic, others might just want to sit and enjoy the food and not spend hours defining the decor.   The menu had quite a few traditional dishes with a modern twist. I went for the hake, served with an almond and capers dressing, while my friends went for the seafood chowder. All really tasty, and still good times all round, even without the skewers and beetroot coleslaw.",
