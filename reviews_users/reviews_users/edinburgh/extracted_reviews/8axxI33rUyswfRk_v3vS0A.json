    "text": "La Favorita is probably one of the best pizza restaurants in Edinburgh, if not Scotland. Situated on Leith Walk where the old Caprice restaurant used to be, they have retained the famous wood fired oven, which makes the pizzas taste so fantastic.   The restaurant is very modern and funky for an Italian with a lively atmosphere and very helpful staff. Prices in La Favorita are a little more than you'd normally pay in an Italian, but it's definitely worth it.   They have a large choice of drinks on offer, with a good selection of Italian beers and wines. The pizza toppings are absolutely divine and are served fresh from the oven for that stone baked taste. I've never managed a pudding here, as i've always been too full, but they certainly look to be as good the rest of the food!",

Winner of numerous awards for its outstanding, stone oven baked pizzas, one can not be anything other than impressed by the quality of the food produced at this traditional, Italian pizza-house. The sheer size and variety of pizzas on offer is mouth-watering - it leaves a sumptuous taste in one's mouth.   Affordable prices and friendly staff add to a fantastic dining experience.

It's far tastier though.   Watch out as unless the menu specifies a omato sauce on the pizza, it will not have one. Its caught people out before. Some of the cheese only pizzas are really nice though especially with ham and artichoke with a garlic butter.   Excellent place to take people with gluten intolerance as they make their own gluten free pizzas an they taste as good as the real thing.   I recommend if you do sit in, you enter through the left hand takeaway door and grab a menu - they often have vouchers for free drinks in them for restaurant meals.",

The starter was very nice containing a good mix of vegetables but the calzone was mostly cheese and ended up being a bit of a struggle to finish. Service was good during the meal despite the place being very busy. Everyone else had log fired pizzas with a variety of toppings which they seemed to enjoy.

Having been around for so long and located down in Leith Walk it can be easily missed or written off by those not in the know! However for those who like their fresh Italian food this place is a must! It's really tastefully and colourfully decorated and it's bigger than it looks from the front.   The staff are always really friendly in a very Italian way! They all know the menu well and are happy to help you through the fantastic and varied menu (and everything can also be made gluten free!!).. All of the food is so fresh and so makes choosing difficult! If pizza if your thing then this is pizza heaven! The base is sooo good, thin and crispy but with a bit of bite cooked in a woodfired oven! The choice is just right and the toppings are so fresh and plentiful - being a spicey girl I'd recommend the Vesuvio every time! To make things even better they also make their own special recipe gluten free pizzas - which are just to DIE for!! And it wouldn't be a good italian dinner without a nice glass of vino and the drinks menu is fantasic, from classic aperitivos, great range of wines (in full and half bottle sizes) to after dinner liquers they have everything to accompany and compliment a fantastic lunch or dinner!  If you have kids then they will love it and it definately wont break the bank!! At roughly 10 for pizza it's great value for money and for every adult eating from the main menu kids eats for 1... Fantastic value!!!",

It's owned (I think) by the same people as the Vittoria restaurant up the road which was fab when I visited, so I expected big things. It's a bit more laid back than Vittoria, so I really liked that vibe, which was great because myself and three friends went here for a wee lunchtime catch-up and had lots of time and space to sit and sip some wine, just chatting.  We booked a table and I'm glad we did because it was mobbed. I couldn't decide what to have so the waiter recommended a couple of things to me and I started with the Arancini, balls of mozzarella, mince and tomatoes rolled in breadcrumbs and deep fried, served with a dipping sauce, and they were absolutely brilliant! The best I have had so far anywhere, by a mile. I went for the broccoli and chicken pasta for my main which was to die for. Honestly, I could eat this every day and not get bored, just my kind of meal.   We had a couple of glasses of wine and left around 2 hours later which was quite lesuirely for a Friday lunchtime, but no-one rushed us, infact, quite the opposite. I would say this place is as good as, if not a teeny bit better than, Vittoria. Top Marks!",

Though all of these apply. It's a bit of trek if you're not a Leith-Walk-er (that was bad, I apologise profusely), but it's well worth the trek.   I went there with a friend who'd just moved to Leith and decided that he had to find his local haunts. He'd heard on the very very quiet grapevine that you couldn't really get better than this, so we headed there not knowing what to expect. And, I promise, this restaurant done good by us.   I ordered the special which was a pizza with ricotta and rocket and other perfect ingredients all put together, and my friend ordered the Vesuvio (a mountain of meat, really). The staff were all quick and gracious. The only downside, I'd have to point out, is the lack of beer on tap. I mean, there's one. And it's a good one, but it's a light lager and I'm an ale-girl.   Definitely worth your while, and though you'll spend about 10 quid a person, you'll have enough food for a couple of days.",

Starters are also outstanding, though be warned they can be quite substantial and are perhaps better shared than consumed alone. Still, in these days of restaurant portions that would barely fill a hamster let alone a fully grown man, it's quite refreshing to have too much instead of too little.   Service and decor are superb.   I would be very happy to go again and again, and you can't give a higher complement than that.",

I exspecially recommend the Vesuvio, is a demon of a pizza! The deserts too do not disappoint, the ice cream was served just at the right temperature with lovely sauces, the panna cotta too is definitely worth trying, a lovely soft vanilla mixes so well with the strong caramel sauce.   It might seem pricey on the menu but the portions are pretty sizable, and the staff are happy to box things up for you to take home (their pizza is uber++ good if you're hungover)   always worth a visit, nice toilets, unoffensive music, friendly staff, good atmosphere :)",

I am not saying that the food isn't good, but it definitely did not blow me away.  We came here because it was listed as a Top 10 Best Restaurant in Edinburgh, according to The Guardian and I definitely would not rate this in my top 10.  However, with that being said, the service was fantastic.  Our servers were all very friendly and attentive.  The portions here are enormous and we did feel that they mislead us into ordering more food than we needed because we did ask if the starters were big enough to shared and they recommended that we order two.  Both plates were huge and we certainly could have just shared one between the two of us.  Not to mention the entrees were enough for 2-3 people to share.  So come hungry!  Ambiance has a little bit of a corny feel but also reminded me a lot of any Italian spot in suburban New York / New Jersey, in the sense that there was Frank Sinatra playing in the background the entire time and the servers were a little over the top trying to prove their Italian-ness (actual, and not the macho mobster Guido kind we see over here in the States).",

Not least because the twinkly-eyed waiter called me \"young lady\" - this kind of complimentary talk earns anyone an instant tip as far as I'm concerned. This eatery is the kind of classic, traditional Italian experience which has to produce at least a smile from visitors, even if you've had the worst day at work ever/been dumped/dropped your favourite ornament/are a generally grumpy individual.  I opted for the Risotto Imperiale, a tasty, well presented, affair, which came with jumbo, juicy prawns and a langoustine with one claw perched on top of a generous portion of rice and champagne sauce. My very critical fellow diner, definitely a pizza enthusiast, went for the Pizza ai due Salami, which after a few minutes of careful munching he announced was \"very good\", definitely high praise for him, before continuing to devour the rest of his meal, (only offering me a small slither).  La Favorita has a pretty extensive menu, with all the dishes on offer you would expect from an Italian restaurant, so if you've got a craving for decent pasta and pizza somewhere different, where you're not paying over the odds, take a wander away from the centre of town and get down to Leith Walk.",

We flew from London to Edinburgh today and so many things went wonky. By the time we got to the hotel, it had been almost twelve hours since I had eaten. I was starving. I am also allergic to wheat. This means that finding a restaurant can be tricky. The hotel staff (reviewed elsewhere) was on it. They got us a cab and sent us on our way to this gem.  I never would have gone for Italian food in Scotland on my own because, hey, I'm in Scotland. Let's eat Scottish food. I am so glad I did, though.  Our server, at table ten, was charming, friendly, and helpful. He definitely made the evening a delightful experience.  We started with the vegetarian antipasto, which contained some of my most favorite foods: zucchini, eggplant, hummus, and artichoke hearts. It was fantastic.  For my main course I had the duck risotto. I am not typically a fan of rice-based main courses. But I love duck and all o the other things listed on this item. It was literally the best food that has ever passed these lips. The duck was so tender and juicy and the rice was so full of all the flavors. It is served in a bowl made of parmesan which lends just the right amount of flavor to the rice.   My husband ordered a steak with figs. He enjoyed, though he is a man of few words (hey, only one of us can be chatty!) and had little else to say on the topic.   We wanted dessert, but there was no room.   Seriously, if you're in Edinburgh, eat here!",

We had two veal milanese that were both thick pieces of veal on the bone breaded and fried - and bland and overcooked. Also a piece of very dry swordfish cooked in similar style (despite a request for very rare) and an underseasoned seafood pasta dish (faggottini)?  Ended up with icecream (chocolate was great) and the five of us were out into the Edinburgh rain 200 quid lighter (we had 2 bottles of the strongly recommended wine).  Was it a bad meal? No not really, but just a bit underwhelming and expensive. Shame - if I go back I'll be sure to order the pizza as that looks great...",

On one hand, I loved the vegetarian antipasti - a massive pile of vegetables and cheese (the chickpea puree was delicious!) that would overwhelm one person, no matter how hungry they were. I also loved my pizza - thin base, log fired Favorita (smoked salmon, fat juicy capers, caviar and shrimp with a generous squeeze of lemon) - in my cold-addled state, every flavour pierced the fug and excited the senses. It was such a pleasure to eat a pizza that didn't disappoint for a change.   On the other hand, while the boy equally enjoyed the starter, he was less enamoured with his tomato-less De Leone - bresaola, radicchio and rocket was not a winning combination for him.

    "text": "La Favorita has fast become a firm favorita with me! Passed by the restaurant on the Leith Walk (about 15 minute walk from the city centre) and feeling peckish decided to give it a go.  We were given a nice, clean table and the waiter instantly made us feel very welcome with his lively patter and infectious good cheer. The menu is very reasonably priced with a wide variety of options for every palate. As a vegetarian, I often struggle due to menu limitations so was pleased to find a lot of different pasta and pizza options. The starters and desserts are also noteworthy with their mouthwatering tastiness and budget-friendly prices. Better still, La Favorita does home delivery! An infinity times better than the usual run-of-the-mill cardboard junk. Definitely give the place a go if you're local, you won't regret it",

    "text": "Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum.   La Favorita is the best pizza place in Edinburgh, full stop. The pizzas are all authentic Italian, cooked in log fired pizza cookers and are absolutely delicious. Above all that they are cheap as chips. The quality is amazing for the price you pay and in reality I'd happily pay more. 6 for a Marinara!! 10 for the Vesuvio and something like 12 for a pizza that has sirloin steak on it! The place is just such amazing value for money.   The fact all their pizzas are available to order as take away and delivery should really put Domino's and Pizza Hut out of business. How anyone can pay for the other two brands (and all the other pizza delivery places in the city) is just scandalous.   Whether you are sitting in or taking away, this place is a gem. If you're sitting in I'd recommend the bruschetta or mozzarella wrapped in Parma ham as starters and get some of their lovely Italian Ice-Cream for desert.   Edinburgh's number one pizza, bar none. PICK UP THE PHONE!",

It's still as good as I remember - I had the 5 cheese pizza (but with added chicken, my favourite pizza topping) and LOVED it - such a good combo of cheeses, tasty blue, salty pecorino, stringy mozzarella...  I can't remember the others now but it was delish!  I used to always get the Zia Rosa (chicken and peppers with cherry tomatoes but am glad I tried another - they're both fab!)  The wedges were nice too but would have been better if crispy and with a bit more parmesan, I liked the truffle oil though.  I like the decor and the staff are always very friendly and efficient.  They even used to deliver to me in Slateford when I lived there, despite it being completely the other side of town!  :)",

The lunch specials are where La Favorita shines on quality and price. 8.95 nets you a main and drink, or 11.95 with a dessert. The pizzas are large enough to satiate a full appetite, or even to be split if you only have the munchies.  The mushrooms on their pizzas are the perfect kind; small and flavorful and a perfect compliment to the pepperoni. With some chili oil you've got proper flavor in abundance!",

    "text": "Hold up, another review for La Favorita's delivery service (and a good one at that).  Now, they warn you that if you're booking at a busy time (Friday/Saturday evening, for example) that your order could take up to 90 minutes, so pre-booking is advised.  I've fallen prey to this mistake before (the mistake of not ordering in advance) but I can't say I wasn't warned.  Last night, however, our pizza was delivered very quickly, so 6pm on Sundays mustn't be peak times!  Anyway. We like to order a pizza and a pasta to share, and the best day of the week to do this is on a Tuesday as like every other pizza chain and its dog, they do a deal on a Tuesday. But just to be different, it's not a 2 for 1, instead it's order a full price pizza and get a pasta for 1, which given the pizzas are several pounds cheaper than Dominos et al, is definitely a good deal.  But do you know what's a better deal? The desserts. You can order two for 6.50, and if you've got a sweet tooth you should definitely avail yourself of this. But don't just order any pudding, order the profiteroles. Why? Because there are two sizes of profiteroles (7 and 10) and both are included in the deal. Which is insane, as ordering 10 profiteroles by themselves costs 7.95. And yet you can get 20 for 6.50. I've now got lots of profiteroles in my fridge. Did I  mention they're salted caramel ones too?..... I'm drooling on my keyboard!  Oh yeah. and the pizzas are great! Proper, authentically Italian tasting pizzas, with gluten free bases available.  I'm normally a pepperoni girl, but La Favorita inspires me to try something different, and I've yet to go wrong. The pastas are decent, I did really like the vegetable lasagna but that is no longer on the delivery menu, so last night it was normal meat ragu lasagna, which was tasty. Not the best I've ever had, but decent.  I've actually only eaten in once, a while ago, but from what I remember service was friendly and prompt, and we had a great time drinking wine and eating pizzas in the sun.  Like any takeaway, if you're ordering lots then it'll be pricey, but if you're savvy and you get deal happy, you'll come away with a tasty meal and won't feel like you've broken the bank.",

    "text": "I'm going to have to add another shining review to La Favorita's already gleaming Yelp page. But, man, those pizzas!  Fresh, seasoned to perfection, generous in toppings; delicious, delicious, delicious. I really don't think I've had a pizza that's bowled me over like La Favorita's. This, my pizza-loving friends, is the pizza of dreams. And the fuss, it's all well-deserved.  La Favorita is a flashy affair. As you walk into the restaurant, you'll pass the swish open kitchen. Efficient and fast; churning out pizza after pizza. There's a genuine camaraderie between staff, and we received an enviably warm welcome. It's all go. And the smell of classic Italian flavours looms in the air. Just catching sight of the dishes making their way from kitchen to table had me drooling. I couldn't wait to have myself one of La Favorita's acclaimed pizzas.  The Nduja (mozzarella, italian sausage, spinach, nduja & red onion) and the Ventricina (mozzarella, premium spicy salami Ventricina, chicken breast, peppers, red & green chillies) did not disappoint. Not one bit.   Service, for the most part, is smooth. - Waiters are animated and energetic, adorning braces and friendly grins. Other than some trouble in catching our waiter for the bill, we were definitely well attended to.   La Favorita's just perfect for a special occasion. - During our visit for dinner, the lights were turned right down as the tune of 'happy birthday' rang out. This, of course, didn't bother us, but I imagine that on a night of several birthdays, it might be a little distracting considering just how dark it got. Nonetheless, nothing could distract from just how good the pizzas were.  Italian in Edinburgh? La Favorita is foolproof!",

I know it's probably horrendously untraditional and sacrilege of me,  but I like a bit of stodge to my pizzas. Our pizza here was a little crisped at the edge but the thin base was very soft and melt-in-the-mouth. We opted for the Vegetariana, replacing the mozzarella with dairyfree Italian rice cheese and omitting the mushrooms (my husband & I don't like mushrooms). As an aside,  I've just looked at the website menu again which lists the Vegetariana as having asparagus,  aubergine, sauteed carrots,  and sliced potatoes. Our menu had mushrooms,  aubergine,  and peppers.  It was 14\" as standard so we split a pizza and a side of wedges.  We asked for wedges with no parmesan (usually not vegetarian,  as well as obviously not vegan) and they were nice. Not as fluffy as I prefer my chips to be, but they were a tasty accompaniment.   Service was fantastic,  and I felt the food arrived quite quickly. I look forward to their Glasgow branch opening soon!",

I'd love to give this an extra star just for the timely delivery and the polenta chips, which are great, but really, it wouldn't be representative: I have not found the experience as a whole A-OK. My three starses are chirpy. But I am currently sad and doleful. And it looks like this will be the very first two star review, so anybody reading this, please just assume I'm wrong, because I am so in the minority and I want La Fav to do well.  But anyway, I'm writing because it is my habit to do so. Here goes.  I heard such amazing things about La Fav's pizzas. They're the best in Edinburgh! They're astonishing! They're... really not... for me.   And to say that I'd sooner pay the extra couple of quid and get a pizza from a national chain is really upsetting for me, because I'd love to prefer somewhere local and non-chainy and freshly made and all that jazz.  And I tried. Really. I was super unimpressed with the first pizza I had delivered, which was a calzone. When it arrived, sure, it was big, but it was also completely wet and falling apart. It bled juice everywhere, was not all that warm, and was just - well, if *I* don't enjoy a pizza, something is wrong.  Anyway, I figured that that something that was wrong must be me, because the reviews continued to pour in. Hooray for La Fav! We love La Fav! Their pizzas rule pizzaland! So I tried again, a couple of months later. And, well, this one was not bad. It also wasn't all that good. I just felt it lacked flavour. It was - I can't believe I'm saying this about a pizza - boring. Not boring like simple-and-predictable-but-yummy-nonetheless. Just... eh. I paid all that for this? Here's the kicker. I. Didn't. Finish. It. A pizza. Me. ...Tears.  So there's my saga of twin woes. My chronicles of double disappointment. My tale of two pities. Have a great life, La Favorita. I wish you all the best.

Delivery is offered and it is good, but because it is just so so much better fresh, I'd recommend just going there and eating. If you're getting take-away, it's just not going to be as hot and the ingredients that are meant to be fresh (rocket/arugula, prosciutto) are going to be included in separate baggies for you to place on top when the pizza arrives. This is appreciated rather than having the prosciutto baked with the pizza, but it does mean that the presentation and \"fresh out of the oven\" factor will be lost when ordering this for delivery. But it is fantastic pizza! Go!",

It pains me to write this because there are so many things about this place that annoy me.  -1.50 delivery charge no matter how much you order.  -If they get something wrong they will always say 'we will send you out a voucher' - NEVER happens  -Always trying with the upsell when you eat in. I know that is the Italian brusque 'style' of service but come on - give it a break! I don't want to order your overpriced wine.  So to recap. Good for Edinburgh, if you are a tourist from a big city (hell, even a small city) in USA or even Europe you will find this place a bit lacking. We have a million pizza places and this is the best one but the comparison pales when removed from Edinburgh.   Neapolitan pizza, 00 flour, wood fired oven. Has all the hallmarks of a great place but misses just due to the fact there is no decent competition. I know that down the road there is another good pizza place but the culture is not alive in Edinburgh.  Get - pizza  Don't get - sold their expensive wine",

The atmosphere is great, and the staff were kind and very helpful. My opinion: ask for the pizza \"well-done\". Also, pasta is good, but a little too oily.",

    "text": "In Scotland with my running group to run the Edinburgh Half/Marathon, and we had our team dinner here.  We had 25 people in all!  The restaurant was already very crowded, and the place was tight with other customers waiting for tables.  Busy doesn't even begin to describe the environment, but the waitstaff couldn't have been nicer and more patient and polite, not only with each other but with all the people standing around, waiting to get in.  I was already very impressed!      As I said, we were 25 people, so we had a set menu with choices within that menu.  I started out with the bruschetta, and it was good, which was encouraging.  For my entree, I had the lasagna, and it was delicious!  As good or better than anything in the States, and I've eaten A LOT of Italian food in CA and NY.  It was just as good as the pasta I had in Italy!!!  For dessert I had the tiramisu, which I don't normally care for, but this was also delicious!  The cake part was light, and the custard part was fluffy, and the whole wasn't overly \"watery\" or soggy like some tiramisus can be when they \"overdip\" the cake.  Everyone else in our group enjoyed their choices, with most commenting on how good their food was!      Again, I can't emphasize how incredible the waitstaff were.  It is not easy to serve 25 people at one time with an already very busy restaurant, and they managed to not only serve us, but we were attended to with promptness and cheer.  I never felt like I was being a burden, never had to flag someone down to refill my water or get another drink, etc...  They were always one step ahead of us, and we wanted for nothing!  The service was excellent.   This was truly a wonderful dining experience, and I highly recommend this place!!!",

    "text": "I was desperate for a hot, carb-loaded dinner after landing in Edinburgh and thankfully La Favorita was right around the corner from my Airbnb and had great reviews on Yelp. I was happy to find an Italian restaurant in Scotland since I was looking for some comfort food.  The interior has lots of seating space in separate little rooms. It's all one connected space, but there are separators and barriers around the sections, if that makes sense. There's seating for larger and smaller groups, and I was immediately seated at a table by myself. The staff was very friendly.  I ordered the arancini and seasonal risotto. I told you, I wanted CARBS. The arancini was gooey and cheesy and fantastic and came with a spicy tomato salsa. The perfect appetizer. The risotto was divine! It came in a parmesan cheese crisp bowl and had a parm cheese base, pears mixed in, and balsamic vinegar drizzled on top with some arugula. Everything came together for one delicious, decadent meal. The portion was also huge and I had plenty left over for another meal.  My server and I talked about cats and I instantly felt welcomed in Edinburgh and at La Favorita. If you like Italian food, I definitely recommend hitting them up!",

When I called to check on the pizza I had gotten a text 30 minutes beforehand but still had not received the guy told me it did leave then but was still in its way??? 20 minutes later, still no pizza. I called to cancel the order and they told me that I would have to take it up with corporate two days later! Don't bother people, not worth the headache.

Pros: I asked for a pizza Primavera (Parma Ham as the main attraction) plus salami as an extra topping, and it came with plenty Parma Ham.  Cons: Front of House waitress Maria ignored me for two minutes as I was waiting to be seated in front of her (the pizza chef greeted me and realised that so he called her a couple of times)  I asked for Pizza Primavera plus salami, and repeated it twice to avoid any errors, but the waitress looked clueless as she doesn't comprehend the English language.   Got the Pizza Primavera...but guess what...no salami... I pointed that out to Maria but all she said was that it comes with Parma Ham... I told her that the salami topping I asked for as an extra was missing...to no avail.  Got the bill and guess what...the  2 extra topping was included... Asked to get that removed but she was still unsure what extra topping  (or the absence of it) meant... Got that removed...hurrah!  Paid quickly left no tip...won't come back...  Conclusion: that happens when you hire a waitress who's not a waitress with almost zero grasp of the  basics of English language....what a shame...it used to be a very good place to eat...",

As a heads up, to start with, their takeaway menu is different from the one you find on the restaurant's main website. Overall pros: super friendly service, decent prices, was ready for pick up quickly, and the food was clearly freshly made. Main con: the food itself was really mediocre, I've had way better Italian food for the same price. Our pizza was a bit dried out and had very sparse toppings. The tagliatelle and gnocchi we got were just okay - the gnocchi was bland and the texture of the tagliatelle was a little off-putting. Based on the consistent good reviews I'm guessing the restaurant experience is better than the take away, so go for that if you're wanting to try this place out.",

The vibe is casual and welcoming and the staff friendly and professional. The menu is quite large and overwhelming so it took us a while to figure out what we wanted to order. My Fucco e Fumo pizza was good - the base was nice and crisp, but I expected my 'fire and smoke' pizza to pack more of a punch flavour-wise. There's a good selection of wine, spirits and classic cocktails but the beer choice is a bit limited. For dessert the dark chocolate gnocchi piqued my interest however I was too full of pizza for that so I opted for ice-cream. The ice-cream is amazing! I'd definitely recommend saving space for a few scoops at the end of your meal! I tried the chocolate, pistachio and amaretto flavours and they were so good, particularly the amaretto!",

    "text": "La Favorita has been a long favourite amongst Edinburgers for Italian food.  This establishment specialises mainly in pizzas.  They have been voted best pizza in a few award in Scotland.  I have been eating in this establishment for 10 years as I stay literally 2 minutes away.  I need to be honest and say that the pizza quality 10 years ago compared to now has certainly dropped.  I am unsure if its due to the fact that they have opened a delivery / takeway for pizza or if they have changed the chef but I certainly was disappointed with the pizza.  However, today I am reviewing a non-pizza dish.  It is the Branzino Al Forno which is a whole seabass.  If you look at the picture, the seabass is adequately sized for a portion.  Skin was definitely crispy when served and I am the kind of guy who loves skin.  Why waste?  For me, the fish was properly seasoned and the sides which came with it complements the fish and definitely brings out the flavour of the sea bass.  Only one thing I have to comment was that the fish was a bit slightly overcooked.  Not a lot but just a tad bit.  That said, dish was still great.  Would always come back here as its one of my local Italian joint with hearty meal and great staff.",

Also I had no knife on my table, so took one from the table next to me. so then they had no knife :) Because of course the waitress was so busy, it was hard to flag her down. Super friendly though!

The pizza is of generally good quality and they're able to cater for dietary requirements such as gluten free that would rule out many an Italian restaurant.   That said, it wouldn't be my first choice as the prices are relatively steep and decor can make the place feel a bit clinical.   Takeaway is expensive & many of the topping combinations don't travel well.",

La Favorita has a proper wood fired pizza oven which means the pizzas taste exactly like the do in Italy. They have a massive choice of toppings which will suit everyone's tastes. The pasta and risotto choices are also very tasty although the pizzas are the main draw. The food is always freshly prepared, tasty and reasonably priced. It serves very authentic Italian dishes wih more unusual dishes than the standard lasagne and carbonara that many Italians serve. The restaurant is also family friendly and caters for allergies with gluten free pasta on request.",

The food is always really good - lovely pizzas with nice crispy thin bases, and a fairly extensive menu overall. The staff are generally very friendly and add to the genuine Italian feel of the restaurant. Being half way down Leith Walk it is a little away from the other main eateries or bars in the city but you can always stop in one of the many Leith Walk bars most of which have unique characters of their own. I would particularly recommend Boda alittle further down!",
