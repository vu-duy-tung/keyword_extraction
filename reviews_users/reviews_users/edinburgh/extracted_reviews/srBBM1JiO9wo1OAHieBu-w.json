    "text": "My husband and I took our honeymoon tour of Ireland and Scotland back in August of 2013. When we were in Ireland, preparing to depart for Edinburgh, my husband was consulting his Scotland guidebook and mentioned to me the tradition of \"high tea.\" It sounded excellent, so I looked online for places that offered a gluten free option for afternoon tea. The Scotsman had rave reviews and was the least expensive option, so we decided to stop there on our first day in Edinburgh after a long day of \"touristy\" things (Holyrood and the Castle). We did not make a reservation, but stopped in around 3:30 in the afternoon.  We were very impressed with how classy everything seemed. We were ushered into a quiet room with a few other groups scattered around at different tables. It felt very sophisticated and was quite a fun experience. I ordered the gluten free option and my husband went with the regular. I had a pot of apple tea - it was pink when I added the cream! When they brought the tray out, it didn't seem like a lot of food. The height was deceptive - it's really a ton of food. I started with the finger sandwiches and worked my way up the tray. I liked most of the sandwiches, although I did not like one of the fish sandwiches, so I gave it to my husband.   The thing that really stood out for me was the scone. Oh, my God. The scone. To die for! It was slightly smaller than my husband's gluten-filled counterpart, but the texture was phenomenal (I was recently gluten free at that point). I smothered it with clotted cream and jelly and happily went to town on it. Last, but not least, were the desserts. I remember all of them being delicious, although I seem to recall that the gluten free tray had one less dessert than the regular tray. It didn't matter, though. We both left stuffed. You could have rolled me out of there. Our waiter came back when we were finished and seemed surprised that we finished our trays down to the last crumb. He came across as somewhat haughty and a little judgmental, but we didn't let that get in the way of our experience. We do our best when traveling internationally to be normal, quiet, and respectful (the opposite of the American stereotype some people have).   Anyway, the point is, definitely come here for tea if you're celiac or gluten intolerant or just gluten free by choice. It is so worth it. My husband loved his tea, too, so the regular must be just as good. It is worth every pence!",

The main staircase in the Scotsman Hotel is something to behold, as is the actual building itself, which juts out into the Edinburgh landscape, and is accessed from North Bridge. The building is Victorian, and with its turrets and stained glass windows, is simply stunning.  Despite having not stayed overnight in the hotel, I do have experience of drinking at the bar, surprise, surprise, and having a few cocktails in what used to be the offices for the Scotsman newspaper has massive atmospheric appeal for me. Coming to work here in the heyday of print journalism must have been absolutely awesome. The North Bridge Brasserie and Bar, where you can have yourself a classy and well concocted selection of cocktails, and other beverages, used to be the reception room for the newspaper, and is equally as striking as the rest of the building. Definitely recommended, not least for the rich history and grand atmosphere of the venue.",

The staff are really friendly and make an effort to welcome you and serve you but again I feel it has gone a bit downhill. The cocktails are really good though, but pricey.

It has a gym, spa and stainless steel pool. I've not stayed but I've been here many times hosting training sessions. Some of the function rooms have very low ceilings. As the building was a renovated place of work, it can be a rabbit warren and I've lost a few delegates as they went to the toilet.

The food was by far the best food I have had at an event. The quality of the food was in line with what you would expect in an expensive restaurant, presented beautifully and cooked to perfection. The staff were great, attentive but not lingering and they couldn't have been more helpful and accommodating when organising taxis home (on a very wet night during the festival!).

The spa suite was stunning with a stainless steel pool and wonderful arctic showers! We had breakfast delivered to our room with delicious pastries. They had no issue with us coming back late from our wedding. We were able to deliver our bags the day before.  Our only issue was the staff that came to our door were ALWAYS looking for tips. It was really pressing and made us feel pretty uncomfortable.  The rooms vary in prices and if you're mega rich you could stay in the penthouse!

Fantastic service and kept in the restaurant as we were too many for the bar area.   Chose a selection of tapas style starters which were of excellent quality, taste and variety. Everyone was very happy, and with a couple of glasses of excellent wines the parents were happy too.   We used to like to sit at the windows on the bar stools watching the world go by, but that is only possible in the bar area (the left hand door) now.   Not cheap but not ridiculously expensive, and certainly value for money.   Dress code: smart of you want to fit in, but the staff are much less bothered than the other customers. Noisy kids would probably be unacceptable at lunch time.",

    "text": "Never again  What would you expect for 420 GBP (= 563 EUR!) per night just for the room? Such pricing builds up some expectation. Alas, after having arrived by car no valet parking was offered. I was forced to search for the car park which took 20 minutes to get there due to the general traffic in the town centre at this time of the day. No discounted rate for hotel guests was offered. I was told about it after I had left the hotel by writing. The walking distance to the hotel is about five minutes.   Next the room. The air conditioning did not work. A knob in the wall besides the bed lettered with cooler  warmer had apparently no function. It was a sticky and unpleasant atmosphere to be breathed. The problem was masterly solved by opening the window and by fetching a fan which was put on the desk opposite to the bed. Great idea worth a five star hotel. The bed itself was one of poorest constructions I ever lived (except may be the one in a Tunesian hotel). The elastic springs of the mattress were almost unbuffered by an interlayer like a rug or something else. That really hurted. As if this would not do the situation turned unbearable because of the construction site just beneath the window front towards the bridge. The heavy works continued even at midnight causing much noise which could not dimmed despite fully closed windows. On April 11th, 2012 another couple reported in Tripadvisor: We stayed in this hotel in march and to be honest I felt really upset at the attitude of management. During our stay there were heavy engineering works right beneath our window  and I mean heavy it was the type of thing that you hear about on holidays from hell; which woke us up early each day. On the final night the works went on through the night. Basically we got about 2 hours sleep. So the hotel management must have been be aware of this intolerable situation since long and nevertheless it puts people at a price of 563 EUR per night in such rooms. What a bloody greediness.   This was by far not a five-star-lodging but a *-nightmare. This cannot be compensated with a good will gesture of an upgrade on a future visit as I do not want to stay here ever again. It is shame how the hotel is operated as it has an undoubted great historic atmosphere and charm.",

    "text": "Scotsman Spa  not a five star experience. My mum-in-law was staying with me and my husband for Christmas, and booked us a spa day on Boxing Day as a treat. We were very much looking forward to a day of luxury in this five star hotel. Unfortunately we were let down. First of all, we had trouble finding the spa within the hotel  an unsmiling member of staff directed us, without offering to show us the way. The greeting at the spa reception was similar, if not less friendly, than the one I get at my local council swimming baths. The man behind the desk paid little attention to us (we had to repeat our lunch order several times) and didn't seem to know what he was doing. Not a great start! We were given robes, towels and slippers and pointed in the direction of the changing rooms. My treatment was booked first, but I hadn't been told where to wait for my therapist. After sitting by the pool with my family, I went back through to reception to ask where I should go  luckily my therapist was already there trying to find me! This is where the five star service started. Kayleigh took me up to a beautiful treatment room, and gave me the most fantastic facial I've ever had. She was professional, thorough and very friendly. After my treatment I was tucked up in the very cosy relaxation room, with a cup of herbal tea and a big duvet to lie under. After my treatment I joined my family, who had been having a swim, for lunch. Time for the five star service to end. We had pre-ordered lunch so that it would arrive at 2 p.m. It was served at 2:20 p.m., lukewarm, and incorrect. I had to sit there with nothing to eat while my meal was remade. The gentleman from reception came over to apologise for the delay in my replacement meal, explaining that they didn't know where the chef had gone! The drinks we were given were room temperature, and they were out of ice. (I don't know how a five star hotel runs out of ice, but seemingly they do.) All three of us had chips with our lunch but we were only given one tiny dish of ketchup between us  I had to ask for more, which took nearly ten minutes to arrive. When my meal finally arrived, my family had finished their lunches (having left some of their meals, since their club sandwiches were dripping with way too much mayonnaise) and had to sit there while I ate mine. I had a swim and some time in the jacuzzi while my husband and mum-in-law had their treatments. The pool was crowded and I found the industrial, low-lit area somewhat depressing, but the jacuzzi was lovely. Unfortunately the shower in the changing room, although claiming to go up to 40oC on the dial, never reached anything more than cold. Not very relaxing! There are so many things which let this place down. Nothing, apart from the spa treatment, ran smoothly. I have been to a few five star hotels and this place comes nowhere close to the service I've experienced.  It's simply not five star  very disappointing.",

    "text": "Stayed here for a few days in January. It's beautiful, vintage charming hotel with the modern comfort. It's a bit hard to find from Market street. But all you have to do is find the entrance which is across the street from Waverly station (just cross the stress and walk a few feet to the left) and then ring the 4th fl on the buzzer, they'll buzz you in. The reception is on the 4th fl. Main entrance is on North bridge across the street from the Hilton and that one is hard to miss. Check in was a breeze I was even asked to take a seat and given a macaroon to enjoy while the lady at the reception desk checked me in. I mean a macaroon, hell yeah. The welcome dram is a nice touch. They had good selection of teas in the room, even for a decaf tea drinker like me there were plenty to choose from. Also had a bottle of mineral water, chocolates. They provide robes, slippers, toiletries, shower caps, pretty much everything you need for a comfortable stay. There was no hair dryer I didn't need one so didn't ask.   I had an issue with not been able to plug any electronics to the wall outlets and couldn't use the adapter that I use in other parts of Europe. During my first night the staff had run out of adapters. Next morning, I realized I could not use my flat iron so ran to the front desk to see if I can get a flat iron from them. They have flat irons but didn't have a free one but god bless the lady at the reception because she crawled under tables, checked in the office and finally found an adapter for me at the computer station. Only a woman understands the serious business of not been able to do one's hair so that was awesome. So not only was I able to do my hair but my whole charging my phone, laptop etc. was solved and I didn't have to buy one. I ordered room service the first night. Couldn't get through to the room service number, called the front desk and the gentleman there took care of it for me.  Food came in less than 20 mins. The gentleman who bought my dinner was very pleasant as well. There was no extra service charge for room service at all which is really unheard of. (But beware there is a tray charge for breakfast and they clearly state that).  I was expecting regular mediocre food and was very surprised by the quality of my Chicken stuffed with black pudding. It was super delicious that I felt like I had to write them a note saying how much I enjoyed the food and that was the best room service I've ever had. I know, I know...quite corny but i was in a good mood after that whiskey. ;) Overall, superb in every way with awesome friendly staff. My only beef with this hotel is I left the do not disturb indicator on (they have this button you press and the do not disturb light that turns on outside the room) but I walked in to find the housekeeping staff in my room. I told them I left the do not disturb on and they apologized and left. I didn't get that one? I mean if they just ignore and come in anyway why provide a do not disturb option.  I'm so glad I decided to not book the Marriott or the Hilton and stayed here instead. So if you're in Edinburgh I highly recommend this hotel if you enjoy that old school luxury feeling.",

We had 3 PM reservations and were promptly seated, in between 2 dirty tables that stayed dirty for the better part of two hours. After being seated, we waited for 30 minutes before our waiter acknowledged us. We promptly ordered the Prosecco and tea. We then waited another 40 minutes for our tea tower. By the time it arrived, our tea was already cold. I also had to find to walk around the restaurant to find someone to provide us with a napkin, utensils and plate for us.   It looks like the restaurant is very understaffed. Considering the price and beautiful ambience, we were truly expecting better. The food itself was ok, but certainly nothing overwhelming. And considering we spent the better part of 2.5 hours waiting, I think we would have been better off in Edinburgh's many other options.",

Our room was 303 which is a suite I believe and it was massive in size with a great view of the glass and Christmas market. It has the historic feel with the cozy amenities of a newer hotel.  The bed and linens were comfy cozy, the bathroom had a great tub/ shower with good amenities. There is a bar and restaurant inside the hotel. As well as a really surprisingly amazing spa! The spa was under renovation so we were not able to utilize it but looked so nice with a pool, spa, suana and workout area. They also offer an array of spa services too.",

The receptionist was great at showing us plenty of places on the map to visit with plenty of local knowledge. As our room wasn't ready, our bags where stored to allow us to go for some lunch.   Room 5/5 (an understatement)  For the price on the room, it rivals, beyond doubt, any other room within it's level of price. The view from our room was beautiful and it does seem that for the Scotsman this really isn't a rarety as every room seems to share this beautiful feature. We may have been in the room 30 seconds before a lovely lady arrived with complementary chocolates for us to enjoy along with our complementary dram of whiskey. The room was very spacious. The toilet was clean on all accounts and the toiletries were lovely. The bed was soft and lovely with a great view from it out onto the city. The television sytem was great.   Service 5/5  The staff here are beyond attentive and incredible. Amazingly, it was the ones we seen the less of who done the most. The cleaners are the most lovely people, they had the place looking exceptional which I'm sure is common for this hotel... but it seems personal which is important. The bathroom being left perfect is a big thing which allows the hotel to feel more like home. In addition to this, the two male staff who were on at night were just out of this world. Again small things, but it's how they done them. To foreign national males one with a brown beard and hair and another bald and clean shaven. We asked for ice, it was brought quickly, without issue and with a smile. The same when we were silly and forgot toothpaste the same bloke brought it up.   Locations 5/5  Perfect, close to everything and close to all lovely food places.   Food and drinks 2/5  Only had a dessert here so we can't comment on the food..However, on arrival, we waited and there was no barman. Just a group of loud customers looking about for someone as well. Same thing happened another night. When the barman arrived, he was less than attentive until we were leaving. The cocktail was sub-par and there was no care that went into it as it over flowed. The female who then helped us order dessert made it seem like we were bothering her. Communication for the very first time in the hotel was a problem. Despite this lady either being a native speaker or extremely proficient at speaking the language, she looked perplexed as we ordered dessert as she was simply not concentrating. I get It, people have off days. But for a hotel that was absolutely perfect I think it's fair to point out an area for improvement.   I can't thank this hotel enough and can't wait to come back soon.",

Could have gotten it at Tesco. The scones tasted like they were made with a cornbread mix and they tried to tell us that the butter they gave us was clotted cream. Clotted cream is only yellow and hard when it's old and gone bad. Nor does it usually melt when spread on a warm scone. The staff did offer Chantilly cream as a substitute, which was delicious, but still not clotted cream. The sandwiches were 4 tiny quarters that ranged in bland (cucumber) to pretty good (the truffle egg and the salmon). The desserts were quite good. Particularly the lemon tartlet, chocolate tort, and a raspberry cream custard. This custard tasted more like clotted cream than the \"clotted cream\" provided.  I guess the North Bridge Brasserie closed a while back. They had an excellent tea, now it's served in a very mediocre way in the lounge/bar.",

The wine pour was stingy compared with the other restaurants nearby, and the quality of the wine wasn't the best...at least the one I had wasn't. I was going to get the ribeye steak, but when I saw how stingy the wine pour was, I decided to cut our losses and order the burger. It was dry. We asked for ketchup when we finally got someone's attention, and we each got a teenie tiny one tablespoon little bowl. Not enough to get that dried out Burger down.  The french fries we're just like McDonalds...we might have been better off just getting fast food. The only thing worth going for is the ceilings. It's a beautiful space. I would only go back for a beer...a pint, is a pint. Did I mention how absolutely horrible the service was?",

    "text": "Stayed here as a long-planned upgrade from the - as it turned out - disappointing B&B in Lake Windermere.  The Scotsman is a classy hotel fashioned out of the former headquarters of the Scotsman newspaper in Edinburgh. Thanks to a pretty good (but very poorly designed) nav in our rented (\"hired,\" as they say in the UK) MB C220, we were able to navigate the sinuous streets of Edinburgh and find the hotel. The hotel is located on a very busy main street. This fact exposes one of its chief deficiencies: in order to check in and unload the car, you have to park in the middle of a very busy bus lane, leading to lots of close-calls with buses pulling past to stop at a bus shelter/stop only a few yards farther on. Also, random folks complaining that we were blocking the bus lane. Duh. Also, the parking lot is blocks away and a long haul walk back to the hotel. Glad it wasn't raining at the time!  We were first given a room that had no view other than the wall of the building a few feet away. You could barely see the sky and the feeling of claustrophobia necessitated a trip by my wife back to the front desk to request another. After some discussion behind closed doors between the front of house staff and the management, we were upgraded to a Director's Suite on the 8th floor. This room was a duplex, with the bedroom upstairs and a second bathroom downstairs at the entrance level. A great feature was the flagon of whisky (Scotch, of course) and a couple of glasses that were perks of this particular room level. As it happens, this exact room is pictured in the hotel's brochure. The large master bath was well-appointed but for one weird feature: because the bathroom is in what was the attic of the building, directly under the roof, the main mirror over the sink is mounted on the ceiling at a steep angle. You have to look up to see yourself, and the angle makes it impossible to shave or put on makeup! Fortunately, there is another, smaller mirror, nearby.  Dinner at the hotel restaurant was very pleasant. I had - what else? - fish and chips. They were excellent, but unfortunately not quite at the level of the F&C I had eaten a couple of days before at the Dryburgh Abbey Hotel (see that review, also). Nae th'less, the included breakfasts were quite nice, so no complaints.  Negatives: besides the unloading-loading traffic issue, the only other issue I have is the WiFi. It was simply a pain in the ass to use, requiring almost constant re-logging in with a new UID and PWD each time. I get that they don't want to run out of IP addresses, but they could at least make the leas times longer.  The hotel is just down the street from the intersection with the Royal Mile, a long street that leads up Edinburgh Castle and is lined with shops, all of which sell the exact same cashmere sweaters at the exact same prices! But that's a different review.  I want to give a shout out to the hotel's man, Jorge. He was extremely helpful and cooperative and worked hard to make our stay pleasant.  If you want a great, luxurious hotel experience in Edinburgh, I highly recommend the Scotsman.",

    "text": "Posh pinkies at the ready dahlings, it was time for the Yelpers to do afternoon tea.  I had expected us to be seated in the North Bridge Brassiere, which would have been nice enough as its all leather seating and dark wood, but myself and Tanja were surprised to be informed that we were to be seated in the drawing room - oooh, posh...  Our table for tea for 12 awaited us, a lovely linen clad table with pink orchids upon it which were surprisingly tall (though I could duck under to say hello to fellow Yelpers). The room has its own designated 'Afternoon Tea Manager' who explained what would happen and also took into account our diverse dietary needs - gluten free, vegetarian, no fish, etc. Tea orders were taken and then when big teapots arrived, I assumed they'd be shared but no, these were our individual teapots. I really enjoyed my Edinburgh Breakfast tea but I know the Earl Grey Yelpers were disappointed.  Myself and Jenny L were sharing a gluten free afternoon tea so we got our own little cake stand with a top tier of cakes, middle tier of scones and clotted cream and bottom tier of sandwiches. After a million photos had been taken, we all dived in. The sandwiches were lovely. The Scotsman uses genius bread and although I would have previously not bought the white and brown before as in its early days, it was lousy, it i much improved and our sandwiches were really tasty. We had cheese and tomato relish, ham and mustard, salmon and cream cheese and egg and cress - about 6 of these mixed variety sandwich fingers each. I have to confess here that today at home, I recreated my cheese and tomato relish on genius white for lunch, as it was so tasty :-)  Having previously done the GF scone test at Casa Angelina, I was curious to see what this would be like but the scone was well made, great texture and had a good height (some GF products don't rise properly). The jam came in little jars which I know Laura D didn't like so much, but for GF and contamination issues, I was more than happy with the jars of strawberry and raspberry jam. The clotted cream came in a ball so there was tons for us to slather on, should we choose to.   Our top tier came with little bits of cake. I love miniature bites like this so the meringues with lemon curd were lovely, there were rich chocolate truffles, almondy cake - ok so the almondy cake is not home made but I'll forgive that as any cake made from Daim bars is awesome, cranachan spoons and I think a couple of other things which escape me.  We paid 16.95 each for afternoon tea and for me, the sheer amount of food was great. I would come here and do afternoon tea here again as I thought it was well done and it was very good value for money. What was left (I think about 6 boxes of food) was packed up and given to the Yelpers so no cooking for some people last night (I certainly couldn't face more food afterwards).    Great food and service, nice formal atmosphere (napkins were placed in our lap) and lovely company made this lovely day :-)",

I was able to store my baggage here, walk around town, and then not only come back and have a taxi called for me, but also have the concierge take my luggage to the curb and stay to have a nice chat with me. He also helped me load my stuff into the taxi. Very top quality service. I am only taking off the one star for the lack of tv and the fact that one of the windows in our room had a superficial crack in it, other than that, it is an extremely nice hotel located right in the middle of everything.

The food was excellent, served on silver plates and 3 trier cake stands. The finger sandwiches were neatly prepared: tuna,cucumber,salmon etc.The scones were adequately served with jam and cream, not to mention the delight of the petite mini cakes. Just lovely!  The interior of the hotel is exquisite with wood paneling, soft carpets, chic and classy all in one.  We were seated in the drawing room at the back of the hotel and had the room to ourselves. It had a big fireplace in the corner, which kind of was the focus point.  Somehow the room did not overwhelm me, thus the 3 stars.  I would definitely try and stay in the hotel, if you are able to effort it. Its central location enables you to explore the city by foot and you also have access to the local bus service in no time.",

    "text": "A large group of us Yelpers came here for an afternoon tea today. I was keen to test the quality of The Scotsman version as I've been disappointed recently with afternoon teas.  I expected us to be seated in the main brasserie area but surprisingly we were led to a beautifully decorated room in the back, all set up with white tablecloths and pink orchid flowers. Very lovely although in normal circumstances if you only had a small group the lack of other customers might make this a bit lacking in atmosphere. No opportunity to people watch.   As we were a large group, the sandwiches, scones and mini cakes were plated up separately but I think they normally come on a 3 tiered stand as you would expect. Everything was fresh and tasty. Ham, egg, cheese & pickle and salmon & cream cheese sandwiches (cucumber and cream cheese offered for one of tge veggie option alternatives). Scones lovely - crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Mini jam pots were on offer. A lot of places go this route as I suppose it's easier but to me 'special' means homemade jam. The mini cakes were nice but nothing out of the ordinary. I tried the flapjack, brownie and crannachan before I admitted defeat and couldn't eat another morsel. No macaroons :(  The service was top notch though. I couldn't tell if this was normal or because we were in a group. Nevertheless they were very attentive, speedy and accommodated the vegetarian and gluten free requests brilliantly.   The tea choice wasn't extensive. Maybe 10 teas in total and most of them run of the mill teas. My earl gray was a bit weak but it was served in a large teapot which I liked as I had more than enough tea that lasted throughout. I hate being offered individually sized pots that maybe do 2 small cups.   I would go back but can't rate it 5 stars as nothing stood out as \"wow\" or special enough to warrant a higher rating. Room for improvement but overall a nice experience.",

    "text": "I stayed at the Scotsman for 4 days/3 nights in October 2017. I loved coming \"home\" to my room at the Scotsman! It helps that I keep one newspaper from each of my travels and having a newspaper delivered to my door every day made me giddy. The room came with two complimentary drams of whiskey as well-- my kind of hotel! All fun aside, I stayed at the Scotsman as a solo female traveler and not only did I feel that if I had questions or needed help that I had a reliable resource via the hotel staff, but the Scotsman also made me feel very safe alone in a new country. I have such fantastic memories from my travels and the Scotsman is a great part of that! The hotel was very clean and stylish. The building has its own charm and character. Best of all, the room was so quiet and came with a fan in the closet (I am a light sleeper and it does wonders to have some white noise). The view of the old town from my room on the 8th floor was outstanding!",

    "text": "We just recently stayed at the Scotsman for a couple of days, and I rate them 4.5 stars (sorry Yelp doesn't offer half stars, so 4 is the closest I can choose.)  The Scotsman is truly a first rate hotel.  To begin with, their location is fantastic for seeing Edinburgh.  They are basically right along the royal mile, and across from the train station.  80% of the main sights in Edinburgh are within a 10 minute walk.    Then add in that the building is absolutely beautiful, inside and out.  Even if you don't eat at the hotel restaurant, you have to at least stop in for a drink as the wood, marble, and brass make an outstanding atmosphere.  I assume this must have been the lobby of the old newspaper business.    The rooms are classically decorated and very nice and large.  We stayed in a room overlooking the train station, which I would recommend as the view is stunning from the bay windows.  And thanks to double windows, no noise from the station makes its way into the room.  The, and only improvement they could make is to replace the mattresses with something more comfortable.     The staff were all very nice, helpful, and made us feel comfortable.  Could not have asked for more from the staff.  Can not comment on the food, as we did not have an opportunity to try the hotel restaurant.  Did I mention how fantastic the Scotsman location is?  Well, that includes 5 minute walk to dozens of restaurants and pubs...which is where we found ourselves for all our meals.  This will be my hotel of choice for any future visits to Edinburgh, and I would highly recommend to anyone.",

    "text": "The Scotsman Hotel is a great venue for many occasions, this occasion was a afternoon tea with some Yelpers in one of the function rooms. It was a nice big banquet table set up and we were brought to the room by one of the bartenders. We were then handed to the very capable hands of a function manager - she took our coats and  sat us down.    we were sat on a table with full linen and (porcelain?) crockery. Our water glasses were promptly filled. Once we all sat down she placed the napkin and took our tea orders. They had a full complement of loose teas.  I went for the famous Scotsman breakfast and an additional Jasmine green tea. These are served in full sized classic teapots and strainers.   She also fully explained the delight that were served to us - after ensuring that there were any dietary requirements.  Scones, clotted cream, sliders, bon bons, profiteroles, soldier cut crust-less sandwiches with salmon cucumber, egg, ham, cheese and also some flap jacks and carrot cakes.   The acoustics of the room allowed for a conversation to be followed from all over the table without getting too loud., although the level of conversation topics was at times a bit questionable, but that cannot be attributed to the Scotsman :o)  I had a wonderful time and relay enjoyed the visit. This is something i would be proud to take my mum to when she visits Edinburgh!",
