It's not quite expensive, we ordered more than we could eat and it costed around 16 per person. The food is traditional Scottish and pretty good. I must recommend  Edinburgh sausages and, of course, Robert B's Haggis. All this combined makes a perfect place to go and have a quiet and good dinner, in a relaxing atmosphere.",

Went in for some whiskey tasting...ordered the \"luxury flight\" which was supposed to showcase whiskey from the different areas of Scotland.. but when the sampler was brought out there was no explanation on which one was which, the \"areas\" shown on the boards, didn't match up to the \"areas\" on the menu as far as the whiskeys listed on the \"luxury flight\"...it was impossible to figure out...two of the whiskeys even apparently came from the same area, so then...what's the point?  We asked the staff for help, but they were more defensive than helpful, and didn't seem to understand the problem (so we just gave up).   Our waitress with her \"super hipster\" hairstyle didn't smile at us once and she seemed more focused on complaining about lack of radios, some billing issues, and stressing out about no longer taking reservations on Saturdays with her co-workers than helping us.   I used to bartend and be a server.  We always learned to keep that type of talk to \"back of house\" and smile at guests, not make them feel like they are a nuisance.  It was a very awkward and uncomfortable experience.   Maybe the \"secret room\" side of this place was better..but I'd recommend going to a less \"cool\" place for you haggis and whiskey.",

Bloody Mary is decent- they'll give you Tabasco to spice it up (which you'll want to do if you're American). They were a bit slow on this occasion, but we were there during Fringe, so I think many restaurants experience a surge at this time. However, knowing that, I feel like maybe they needed another staff (either waitstaff or kitchen staff) to keep up. Otherwise, very friendly service and definitely the best haggis I've can imagine.",

Small tables and big old armchairs and a small bar (and check out the ceiling lights). Small, comfy and friendly. Service: Given the fact that there are really only 6 tables it's not surprising that you get well taken care of.  Food: I came here expressly for the haggis. I had the Princess Di one (with a Drambuie sauce). Could really taste the Drambuie, but it was terrific nonetheless. The haggis is served in the more modern deconstructed style which is more common these days and but whatever - it tasted great. But as much as I loved it, I couldn't finish it all as it was a sizeable portion and very rich.  Price: You'd be paying 50% more for a similar meal in the States, and it's definitely worth it for a special haggis and scotch night out. If I ever make it back to Edinburgh I'd make sure of going here again.",

We actually found it in an advert in the back of one of the tourist booklets and thought twice about going because we thought it would be full of tourists (we prefer getting involved with the locals!).  We went for it anyway and were so glad we did. We showed up at about 10pm, quite late I admit, but they were still serving food. The decor inside the place was really lovely, relaxing and warm although the place is quite small. There were two women enjoying a late dinner on one side and a couple having a drink on the other side. Then us. Very nice.   The menu is lovely - some really good choices and their drinks menu is also extensive (there's a reason why they are called the Haggis and Whiskey house!).   My boyfriend went for the haggis which was tasty. The mashed potato was a little bland for me but overall it was good.   I had king prawns \"slowly roasted in a garlic, thyme and soy sauce\" in a salad. It was supposed to come with crusty bread and Marie Rose sauce...No crusty bread, but normal bread toasted (understandable given the time of day we turned up!) and no Marie Rose sauce (although with the soy sauce I would have thought this a bit of a weird combination....). Best part: the king prawns were absolutely gigantic. Lovely.  We loved this place so much we came back in the morning for breakfast! The breakfast was equally as nice. We went for the Glasgow Potato Scones with scrambled eggs and smoked salmon. Delicious.   No faults at all with this place. Highly recommended.",

My boyfriend and I wanted to try haggis, of course, being tourists and all, so our friend brought us to this place on Cockburn [insert joke here] St, right behind were we were staying at St. Christopher's Inn.  If you are ever to visit this place, make sure you get the whiskey sauce (worth the 2 or whatever pounds it costs).  It makes the haggis a lot more flavorful and not as heavy/dry.  I guess since I'd never had it anywhere else, I can't really compare it to any other place.  I can, however, tell you that it was different, but delicious.  Tastes kind of like ground up flavorful liver-like stuff on top of sweet potatoes on top of mashed potatoes.  The food was enjoyable, minus the fact that there was quite a bit too much pepper in the ground-up meat itself.  So much pepper that I couldn't really taste anything else.  That's the only reason for my 5-minus-1 star rating.  Not a very busy place, has a full bar I believe.  Service is great though.",

When it occurred to us that we should find somewhere for lunch, we happened to be in the touristic centre of town, so we feared we'd either find a place that was just awful or that was OK but overpriced. We liked the look of this place and staggered in, and even though there was a short wait for a table to come free, we decided it looked promising enough to wait.  The decor is quirky, with tables surrounded by mismatched chairs that look like they could belong in an office or a parlour. The menu is interesting, with a range of Scottish dishes on offer at what seemed to us fair prices. Intrigued by the promise of Edinburgh's best haggis, our order included two haggis-containing dishes: the Robert Burns (haggis stacked with potatoes and turnips) and a chicken stuffed with haggis. Other dishes we ordered were the sausages and a cheese plate. All the dishes were fantastic, but the haggis was the definite star of the show, very tasty and without the offal smell that sometimes can come with poorly made haggis. We were definite fans.  To top it off, the service was very friendly and professional. This was a great first meal of our Scotland visit.",

    "text": "The most edible haggis. Exceeded my expectations and a charming spot, to boot.    Basically, I came here to try haggis and drink scotch.  This place was one of three that is known for their haggis being the best (I like it say the most edible).  I chose here not only for the \"best\" reviews or the prime location, but because of the warm and charm it exudes as you walk past it.  You don't even need to come here for haggis.  Just come in because it looks like the place to be.  Let me tell you what I ate and some flavor notes.  Haggis bon bons- seasoned, fried, comes with a balsamic gastrique and crispy kale.  Barely gritty, not offal-like at all, pleasant and palatable. Kale is a nice touch, in terms of texture.  Cheese plate: Hebridean blue, smoked Auld Reekie, Island is Mull cheddar, caramelized onions, herbed olives, Kerrygold butter, grapes. The reekie and cheddar were good cheeses on their own.  The blue was by far the most versatile in terms of pairings with the scotches and accoutrements.    Scotch whisky: Scapa, Dalwhinnie 15, Auchebtoshan Bruichladdich, Glenlivet 12.  Scapa and Bruichladdich paired best with cheddar/no accoutrements.  Reekie best with Scapa, Auchentoshan, and Dalwhinnie.  Blue cheese best with Bruichladdich and Glenlivet, and onions.  Would love to hear anyone else's tasting notes!  Hope you enjoy this place!",

I ordered the lamb burger, Yan got the Haggis & Kenyon got the fish & chips. All dishes were delicious we tried one another's. With Haggis being a Scottish dish I couldn't leave without trying a bite of Yan's. It was incredible and presentable! The French fries were thick and not as salted as I'm used to in America. Definitely recommend to stop on in!",

I'm always interested in trying new food so I definitely had to try the best haggis in the world. I was in Edinburgh for the day and my partner and I stopped by. It's a smaller venue so if you try to go on a weekend or holiday definitely book/call in advance.  My partner had the deconstructed steak and ale pie while I had the haggis served in a whiskey sauce. The haggis along with the whiskey sauce was one of the most flavourful thing I have ever tasted. It was so good that I went back twice more on seperate vacations. I will always try to stop by this place when I visit Edinburgh. Definitely going back",

The male server from Czech was especially great, helping me choose how to sauce haggis (go for the Whisky sauce!).   Overall, highly recommend this restaurant.",

My boyfriend had an entire section devoted to whisky, so he was happy too!   We went with the Princess Diana-style haggis, which came with a creamy Drambuie sauce that was perfect for the hearty dish. What is haggis like? For Americans, compare it to crumbly meatloaf or the meat portion of shepard's pie. It's hearty and delicious and the portion is huge if you are really hungry, and perfect to share if you want to try it without stuffing your tummy full and THEN have to walk around all day.  They claim it's the best haggis in town, and while we only tried one more from another restaurant, I'm inclined to agree. The flavor is really nice, and they really do take pride in making it special. Don't be afraid, you only live once. Enjoy!",

Not a huge fan of bleu cheese normally but loved this one.   He ate the Princess Diana Haggis & I had the deconstructed steak & ale pie. I'm allergic to mushrooms so its normally hard for me to find a meat pie that I can eat, so not only was I beyond excited to have found one, but it was absolutely delicious as well.
