    "text": "I have been thrice so far here: wee place that actually fits some tables for lunch.   It offers a quite good range of cold and hot food, and also a loyalty card for meals!   The quality of the food is very reasonable and is worth at least one try :-)   The highlight is that their earnings go to social causes and that 20% of their staff were homeless.   I can't think of an easier way contributing to a social cause triggered by my lunch habits, can you?? :-)",

    "text": "Have yet to have more than a coffee in here but it deserves your custom purely for its social ethos & the benefit that spending money here brings to those less fortunate than the rest of us.  There's not a great deal of space in the booths available but then it's a small site and more of a takewaway than the sort of place you'd plonk yourself all day with your laptop. Perfectly adequate for a quick lunch and a catch up though.",
