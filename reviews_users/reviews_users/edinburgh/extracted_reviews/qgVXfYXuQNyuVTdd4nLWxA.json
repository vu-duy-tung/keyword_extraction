    "text": "The JAM HOUSE is local music house that normally gathers to the local jazz crowd.  On select evenings, however, they present a \"Scottish Experience\" - an evening devoted to Scottish music and food.  We were on a CIE tour of Scotland and Ireland and the Scottish evening was part of our tour package -- along with about 6-8 other tour buses full of tourists.  This is something that truly caters to the tour crowds and tour buses.  The food was pretty good - nothing exceptional - and included a small taste of haggis (you can;t go to Scotland without at least tasting haggis). I thought the haggis was good and my wife offered that if there's enough seasoning and salt on it -- most anything will taste OK.  The room housing this event was large and it was packed.  The staff serving the food and wine was stretched pretty thin and it was a challenge to just get another pitcher of water for the table.  In short, you don't go here for the food or service -- you go here for the Scottish experience.'  After dinner, the Scottish \"experience\" got rolling.  We had a great evening of Scottish music, dancing and bag-pipes.  The musicians and the dancers were excellent and the \"experience\" was quite enjoyable.  Again - go for the Scottish \"experience\" but don't expect great food or service.  The food and service are adequate but the \"experience\" was great.",

    "text": "Bad experience. We were among a tour group and try to enjoy a dinner show there. What we paid for are a 4 meal course, and 2 glasses of wine. It started out ok. We got a first glass before the appetizer. Throughout the dinner, we asked 4 separate times for the 2nd glass, it never came until after the desert and coffee. I was so upset and ask them where the hell was my wine, they rudely gave me some nonsense excuses. I felt that one guy wanted to sucker punch me. Very ghetto. The show is ok, if they have better sound system and better microphones, better lighting, it will be much more enjoyable. The food and wine was very good. Just couple of staff not fit for service industry. The reason I can say that because I am a owner of a bar and restaurant.",

You're going to get a $3 dollar type of wine. Also even do I love traditional shows and dances. This particular place it's over kill about their show. Meaning it goes on for ever, they sing 15-20 of songs that will put you to sleep. For sure that's their traditional, how ever they could cut the show by 20 minutes or cut few songs that nobody can relate to or understand. I did have good service, waiters and waitress were fast and polite. The traditional dance were fun, and few of their songs were good. But like I said over kill with few song. When you think it was their finally, here comes another song. I highly recommend you try this place and judge for yourself.",

Thankfully the place wasn't uncomfortably busy once we got there so that was a bonus. Other than that though the things that had put me off in the past are still in evidence, namely poor acoustics (benefit of the doubt - the PA and shoddy mic in use may have been the organisers' rather than the venue's) and they still don't stock tomato juice so bloody marys are out of the question. Best left to the older & older at heart for the better part of another decade I think.",

Not a DJ playing Abba/S-Club megamix.  The bar staff looked like they were there under duress. When I ordered two cocktails, the chap looked at me like I just asked for two pints of his kid's blood. The vodka martini served was appalling.  It was also the Jam House's 10th birthday and they had a couple of trays of chocolate cake at the bar for guests. But when I say chocolate cake, I mean a gateau that had been butchered in to 'slices'.  I had to laugh at th ads on the big screens for the birthday celebrations though. Pics of the likes of Ben E King, Martha Reeves and Jools himself; supposedly as Jam House favourites. When all around me, it was hen parties and dodgy middle aged dads out on the pull.  To be fair there was a band setting up but lord knows what they were going to play. We didn't last long. I sank a pint of beer and it was quitting time.",

The venue was everything she needed, great area of dance floor - handy for the 50+ Irish dancers that were jigging away, great stage area for the more contemporary dances/ bands that played and big enough for the volume of people that came to support albeit only just as at one point there was a shortage of seating and then standing room only towards the back.    Brilliant evening raising money for a very worth while cause in a very nice venue!   Great time had by all :)",

Although book well in advance as it gets busy!! In all honesty it think its the only dance place i have been to that you can find people on their late 50s 60s mixing with 20 year olds ( like me ...ahem) !  Really good for hen nights or a big group!",

That quickly describes an enjoyable evening out at JAM House with my work colleagues not so long ago.  I am glad that it was a big group. I would not go there on my own (just saying ;-) ).  Its better with a crowd. The age range is between 25 - 60 years. It was not as busy on a FRI night as I would have expected, but then, we live in times where people rather stay in and have a few pints.  The drinks are not cheap, but still affordable, if you don't drink too much. I had tomato soup as a starter and steak (medium/rare) for my main, and both courses were excellent. I was seriously surprised about the steak being so good considering that you only paid 16.50 for the menu and the aftermath.  Last but not least, we all had a bit of a dance, enjoying the 80's music that hit the dance-floor. Who does not love a bit of  \"I'm so excited, I just can't hide it....\" sung by the pointer sisters! Sure, I would recommend you being an 80's Fan or at least experience it for once.   Who knows what you might be missing out on!",

Jools Holland owns it- which gives it some credit I suppose, and it's nicely decorated inside but it's not my cup of tea. It seemed to be a playground for the over 50s looking to re-live their youth. It reminded me of dad dancing at a wedding - you know the sort. On several occasions, sweaty old men made their move towards me, at which point I hastily circled the room. Food-wise, it wasn't anything special either. I had pan-fried chicken without realizing it doesn't come with anything else, should have ordered sides. Yeah it was ok, and the price wasn't too bad, but nothing worth going out my way for.",

Well I was, my university end of term ball. But it does feel so much more grander than that. The food was so much better than the price tag suggested (I imagine this was to do with a deal with the university as I have looked at the restaurant prices and it ain't cheap) and the ambiance was spectacular. The staff made us feel like we were more than just grubby students dressed in our finest gear. The whole night was fantastic, and I understand why my university uses this venue each year.   Jam House also operates as a restaurant and an up-market club. It is worth a visit for whatever reason you can find.",

    "text": "Went to the Jam House quite late on a Saturday night out with about 8 others a couple of weeks ago.  The 8 entry charge put me off right from the start!  There's no way I would usually pay that much to get into a venue unless I knew of something special happening, however the group I was with decided to go in.  Very long entrance way and bar before you get to the back of the venue to the stage and dance floor, which is massive.  There are even a few booths overhead, like at a theatre.  It is a lovely venue and would be great for watching a live band.  There was actually a live band playing when we arrived (which I'm guessing was the reason for the exorbitant cover charge), but unfortunately they only had a couple of songs to go until they finished.  Then the dj played 70's and 80's music all night.  It was fun and had a good dance, but had had enough after a while.  We certainly felt very young, compared to the majority of the patrons who were between 40 and 68 I reckon.  I wouldn't choose to go back, but can see how the Jam House would appeal to an older crowd.",

    "text": "My boyfriend used to know this girl who thought that the Jam House was the least cool place in town.  I think that she's just not cool enough to realise just how cool this place is.  It's cool like the 80s.  It actually IS cool like the 80s.  It has that kind of dorky but majorly fun vibe that is the joy of an 80s party.  I almost said \"... that reminds me of the 80s\" but that's a lie; I'm way too young to remember the 80s.    A previous reviewer said that it's like going to a family wedding because of the all ages crowd.  That is completely True and is one of the JEMs (what disguises itself as a typo is really my brain reminding me that I do remember some of the 80s...) of this place.        The majority of people who go to the Jam House aren't out for a pretentious night out, they just want to listen to some good music and dance without caring who's watching.  Yeah, you will probably end up dancing with a dad and make his night, or with a mom who is wearing heels for the first time in years and can hardly stand up.  That is all part of the charm of the Jam House.  In exchange, you will find that the door charge is one of if not the cheapest in New Town and and the bar considerably easier to get to than anywhere else on a weekend.    I've never eaten here so can't comment on that aspect but the quality of the night out is, well, cool.  Like the 80s.",

The food on the upper level is traditional Scottish fayre. You don't have to go there to eat,but worth it if you do. The wine is very reasonably priced, so get in by 9pm, grab a nice bottle from the main bar and gaet a table near the main stage, sit back, relax and enjoy the evening to sounds of the house band, or whatever guest bands are on.  The music is varied from jazz to rythm n blues. A very enjoyable and entertaining venue for a good night out,  can be very busy on a weekend, so get there early or phone and book a table in advance.",
