The personell is very friendly and efficient.  The cakes are served with a personal touch. I ordered a brownie and got the whole deal, a brownie served  with cream and chocolate sauce and chocolate buds and  a joke by the waiter. The hot chocolate was tasty enough although I would recommend a touch more chocolate to be added to the milk. Prices are not cheap, but then it's acceptable for the area. For a peppermint tea you pay 3. The interior is modern with a rustical touch.  Its a good place to also meet friends for coffee and enjoy some social time.",

Forgot our drinks, gave our daughter the wrong order and had to make several trips because she would leave before listening to us about the other things she had forgotten (like cutlery and napkins) and never brought the water we requested when first sitting down. It happens and all that can be overlooked with a little politeness. But she was abrupt and then argued about our daughters order blaming her.",

I wasn't crazy about the oat in the freshly made smoothie, but that was my own fault since I knew that going in and should have picked a different option, many of which appealed to me. The decor was pleasant with clean new wood walls and artistically spaced greenery, and the view of the old stone building across the street is fun to study through the window. Staff was efficient.",
