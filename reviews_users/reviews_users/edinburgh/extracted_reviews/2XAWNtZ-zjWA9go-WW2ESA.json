    "text": "I came to this restaurant for the first time just over a year ago and it was so good I had to come back especially! I recall that myself and 2 others all loved our meals the first time, but this time it wasn't quite up to the same standard. Don't get me wrong, I would still recommend it, but not good enough to get 5 stars.  I had the duck this time which was a little overcooked and thought the sauce didn't quite match. However I tried a little bit of my Dad's veal with parma ham, mozzarella in a wild mushroom and white wine sauce and it was delicious! That sauce! The vegetables that accompanied our meals were on side plates and looked a bit like they had come out of a pre-cut packet from the supermarket. Not great.  And an absolute must however, is the Tiramisu. Delectable. :)",

Lovely, friendly service, delicious appetizer, and good wine. Not to mention it has a lovely atmosphere--we walk past this place often and always paused by the windows with our noses pressed against the glasses, peering inside wistfully like children, commenting, \"Doesn't that look cozy?\"  And indeed it was. If you're looking for some good Italian eats, give this place a shout.",

I had a very enjoyable meal here with friends and would be happy to return for another outing.   I opted for the seafood pasta and when it landed on the table it was like half of the ocean had been put in front of me. Mussels, prawns, shrimp, clams and squid along with tomato sauce and spaghetti - yum!   I was far too full to try anything else, but I fancy a return to try the desserts!",

The sign MIA is displayed clearly in front of the entrance with 2 massive windows flanking the sides.  Inside it's lovely and warm. The interior looks very Italian. The stonewalls make the place look very rustical. On either side of the bar are tables and chairs. They also have a waiting area offering 2 cozy couches where you can relax after a busy day.  The menu offers seabass, sirloin steak, fillee steak, pizzas and pastas, antipasti like parma ham and melon, bruschetto, salads and much more.  I ordered a Pizza Diavola which costs 2 less when choosing a takeaway. I paid 6.50. Outrageous, considering that I'm getting a smaller sized pizza from Dominos up the road for 12 (oh yes I'm being ironic :-)) And you know what? The pizza was delicious, no cheese nor pepperoni spared.  The staff seems very polite and helpful.  The place is ideal for everybody, even for dates.  Currently they offer groupon vouchers for a 3 course menu, incl coffee and wine. They also do Valentine Dinners for a special affordable price.   GO GO and don't miss out!",

We were very happy with everything we ordered.   We were very impressed with the special regional menu that they are doing for dinner. From what I gathered it looks as if they are putting together a special menu representing the different culinary delights of the many regions in Italy. This special menu will be changing. At the moment the featured region is, Campania and the menu looks divine. It's set but if you choose you could always go Al a carte.   Overall  I recommend this place if you are looking for a nice italian meal, with the possibility of trying new more authentic plates.",

The food was above average and a good value.  The service was lax and it appeared as if the wait staff were too few and required to clear their own tables.  I recommend this restaurant it has the lovely sound of people enjoying food and friends.",

Thankfully the birthday party was hidden away at the other side of the restaurant behind the bar which separated them nicely otherwise that could have been a bit overpowering!   Some stuff took quite a while to come out, and the staff seemed a bit distracted at times, but the overblown italian accents keep us entertained.   Head here for some great pasta, good wine and nice atmosphere.",

I'd tried a fair few places to eat late. Had a really hard time with the horses and worked the fields late......  The staff here were great! They were able to bring me olives, then some superb bread and butter.  The pis de resistance was the tiramisu. The wine was brilliant too a lovely rich montipolcino (sp?).  Great menu.  Lovely sea bass. Can't wait to go back.   They have beautiful comfy sofa seats too.   I just think they are great. The were closing but served me with great thought and dignity ..... I looked like farmer!  It's a fairly swish place.   Ciao Mia!!",

We were greeted warmly at the door and chose a table. I had a glass of red wine and we shared a small bowl of olives as a starter.  The menu isn't particularly extensive, nor interesting. It has the usual selection of starters, followed by main courses of pasta, pizza, chicken, fish and steak. They do have some daily specialities, one of which was a vegetarian risotto on that day.  I asked about the pizzas and the waitress said she can ask the kitchen to make the base especially thin, as that is how I like them.   From our table we had a partial view to the kitchen. Food arrived quickly and soon I was tucking into a pizza with mozzarella, prawns and rocket. It had a thin base indeed and tasted very nice. Really enjoyed the house red as well.  Staff at Mia Restaurant are super friendly and accomodating. I would happily return to try some of the other dishes on the menu.",

We both ordered fish and my tuna in a caper and tomato sauce was pretty sublime. People often talk about food \"melting in the mouth\" and, food the first time, I can say this was just that. Mia's chef is a talented man! For pudding, I couldn't resist the tiramisu - it should be good being from an italian restaurant and it was. Not to coffee-ish and very creamy. Highly recommended all round and it deserves it's TripAdvisor top three placing. Mia is popular, though, so make sure you book early.",
