    "text": "We stayed at the Principal Edinburgh for a few nights and went for desserts and drinks at the Printing Press. Great atmosphere, excellent service! We had The Laird of Glenroy, Lady of the Lake and Prince Charming; bar tenders do hell of a job making drinks, fabulous offerings and great preparation. Tried Savarin cake on waiter's recommendation and didn't regret at all.  We also had breakfast one of the mornings, a very typical regular hotel-restaurant offering. Hot and Cold breakfast options - cold options were better prepared and had better quality compared to regular hot options, was expecting better from them!  Overall great location, service and drinks!",

They were playing great music, not too loud and the service was quick and friendly. Overall relaxing and a great place to spend time.   Since it was lunch, the two of us split an appetizer and had a couple of mains. The courgette, mint, feta and rocket salad was brilliant. Salty, charred, bitter and minty all at once. For mains we had the steak sandwich with marrow butter and the fish fingers with chips. Both were excellent, well cooked and nicely portioned.   Top marks for food, service and ambiance, am looking forward to coming back for dinner.",

    "text": "Y'all know I take my dining experience seriously especially when I go to a place that requires me to dig a little deeper in my pocket to pay. I'm happy to do that on occasions since food and dining out are some of my life passions, but be sure I'm going to be critical. One of my fave people was here from Manchester over the weekend and we wanted to try a new place to eat that served something of the new modern Scottish food. I was excited about this place because the restaurant looked amazing from the website and the menu showcased Scottish meat, fish and produce.  The first negative happened when I called for reservation. To be fair it was a late request for reservation on a Saturday night but I wanted to try my luck. Not surprisingly the staff said they were all booked and the next open table was at 9:30pm... Fair. I told my friend this and she said hold up... Text me back and told me they lied! Apparently she was able to get reservation through <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fopentables.com&s=770021bb55ff1fc0c98bc98c07a9a10147f732bb5ec2e742c2a08c1dd8c68f92\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">opentables.com</a>.... That annoyed me! So lesson learn... Go on open tables for reservations instead!   The restaurant looked similar enough to its picture on the website, but it did remind me the many times I see someone's pic on a dating app and I meet them and I'm like wtf... When was your pic taken?! Anyways...I was starving and I just wanted food. We barely got the menu and the waitress came up and asked for our drinks order. Well first off, we just literally sat and we weren't given a drinks menu... So no, I don't know what I want... Thanks!   After waiting a while for the waitress to come back and finally get our drinks and food orders we sat there for a bit...We got a bottle of prosecco and it wasn't cheap. Now I don't really care if I'm getting served and the server making sure my glass is full of wine, but in this case I did mind cause the bottle was expensive and in any other restaurant, the server would have made sure my glass was full. The server in this case never bothered checking and we had to serve ourselves.   The food finally came and the pigeon breast with beet salad was tasty. My friend got the scallops with squid ink risotto... I was really impressed with the flavours of that dish! The scallops was cooked very well... Tender but still soft. We both ordered the stone bass with mussels. This was ok... The mussels didn't taste fresh and the fish wasn't amazing. The cream sauce went decently with the fish and spinach while it didn't do anything for the mussels. For 21, this fish  dish is not worth getting cause I was calculating it in my head and  I probably would have spent the same amount or less if I cooked the dish for my friend and I myself.... Just saying.   We didn't bother trying their desserts cause I wasn't impressed and I just wanted to go. When we got the bill... ( a hefty one) I saw that they included a 10% service fee. I was so annoyed.considering their service was poor! I frankly wouldn't have tipped them especially since they barely did anything and I had to walk across the entire restaurant trying to find a server to get our bill so we can go.   The food was ok in this place, but frankly I'd go to another restaurant that can probably cook as well, charge for the same or similar price, and have better service!",

    "text": "Unlike some of the other reviewers, we had excellent service. Our server was funny, attentive, and accommodating.   The space had high ceilings and a marble, ornate design style. The other diners were fairly dressed up, but there were still plenty of people in jeans. Prices were the same as those we had seen at much simpler and plainer pubs around town. (To be fair, we didn't order cocktails.)  Our food was excellent. My friends loved the \"hot smoked salmon\" appetizer (the pickled fennel was much-adored), the fish and chips (light breading that tasted homemade), and the mince and tatties. My baked cod was a bit salty, but the accompanying lentils were amazing, and I don't normally enjoy lentils. My husband's highland burger was delicious, if too well done for American tastes (which is common all over the UK). The burnt cream (creme brulee) and steamed pudding (sponge cake) were good as well.  We would return.",

We were a party of three and they tried to squeeze us on a table for two people. So we asked to be moved, and fair enough they moved us. We weren't given a drinks or food menu for a long time. We called the waitress and she came over asking us if we were ready to order. Unfortunately, we weren't as we hadn't been given any menus. We finally ordered drinks and food at the same time. The starter was impressive and very tasty, I had the scallops served in squid ink, garlic and parsley butter. I had the stone bass for the main which was bland and below average. We didn't have dessert as there was nothing exciting on the menu and we wanted to leave. There is a compulsory 10% service charge on the bill, which I don't mind paying most of the time. However, in this case, they did not deserve it as the service was very poor. I love food and I don't usually regret spending on it. In this case however, the poor service exceeds the quality of their food. There are far more places in Edinburgh with similar prices, better quality food and far better service.   The bar has a good selection of whiskies. They serve the rare 18-year-old Yamazaki by the glass. Despite this, I would not return due to the poor service.",
