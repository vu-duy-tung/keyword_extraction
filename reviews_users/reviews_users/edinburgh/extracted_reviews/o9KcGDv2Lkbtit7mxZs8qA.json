The waiter was friendly enough, place was clean and all tables were full, a mix of tourists and students. I would definitely return. It's not fancy by any means but if you're hungry you could do a lot worse than here.",

    "text": "I'm going to reiterate what everyone else said about Yocoko: good food, bad service.  As an american studying in Edinburgh for the semester I'm always excited to try international food in the city. I came in around 4 for a late lunch after class and as everyone else said, the host kind of snubbed me. He wasnt outright rude but rather disinterested and quick. Also as others have said i was given a fork while two asian people sitting near me had chopsitcks.  I ordered the veg spring rolls and the sweet and sour chicken with fried rice. The spring rolls and chicken were both good but the fried rice was literally white rice tossed with fried egg. There was a ton of food too.  Then came the weird part. The ENTIRE restaurant staff sat down at one of the tables and started eating. And this was with about four tables occupied in the restaurant. Now I get that they it was kind of between meals but to have no one running the restaurant just seemed crazy. It came to an awkward few minutes when myself and another patron were both finished eating and ready to pay and had to sit there and wait for someone to stop eating and notice us. It became even more awkward when two people entered the restaurant and the host got up with a mouth full of food to seat them.  This was totally bizarre to me. Anyway it only came to 7.80 for a soda an appetizer and an entree which to me is incredibly cheap. Regardless of the weirdness, on a student budget I'm sure I'll be back.",

It's a egg fried noodle dish, with veg, pork, and chillies. It's tasty. Once I ordered something else off the menu and I didn't like it. I've since proclaimed to never deviate from #40.   Once thing to note is that the service isn't great. And yes like others, I hate that they don't offer me chop sticks either. However, this hasn't (and won't) stop me from not coming.

    "text": "I concur with most reviews here and so I try to keep it short. It was my 4th time in 6 weeks that I went to this Noodle Bar. The highlights:  1 - Price: Cheapest in central Edinburgh eg. Starter Chicen Wings + Noodle + coke was 10 Pounds  2- Variety: Around 100 different items to choose from. Menu very organised and categorised, indicating which is spicy and which is veg and from which country each dish originates, and what type of pasta/rice they have, and if wet or dry, etc etc etc. - it's not that much a hit and miss as in other cuisines.  Btw, don't expect Pizza and Burgers though!  3 - Speed of service: Drinks within a minute, Starter 5 mins, Main course 10mins (often I have not yet finished my starter, but I am not picky on this)  4 - Location: Very central in South Bridge close to Biblos and Cow gate  5 - Environment: Always with lots of people, if lucky you get the sofas  6 - Food quality: Very delicious, all four times I was satisfied. Once I tried the chicken with Lemon Sauce - wonderful  7 - Portions : Noodles, Rice, Pasta, etc abundant, very filling.   8 - Green tea free of charge (Never heard in Edinburgh!)  What can be improved  The service is not always 4-star and maybe the management needs to have more Scottish waiters (with that extra smile, and courtesy)  of get the asian ones (including the management) some tutorials of service for UK customers. They waiters seem to suffer with chaos-attack when there is a lot of people, kinda confused.  Don't expect a set table and for astrange reason the cutlery is always one napkin and one fork (where's the knife Bruce Lee?)   It is a very popular Noodle Bar, and always full of people during peak hours and weekends (and fringe festival) so it is not forth-granted you find place to sit immediately.  I haven't tried the heavy dishes (meat, fish, duck and set menus etc.) but I am quite sure that are also delicious.  If they just improve the service and can find a way to make the place larger, it would have more five-stars.   Highly recommended, I am going again to try a wet noodle dish (from what I've seen, the size of a face-washing basin/bowl!)",

I have a challenge for you Yocoko.  I will continue to frequent your establishment because I leave only about 5 lighter... but if you do these three things, consider yourself FOUR starred.  1. Give me f*cking chopsticks. You give them to Asian people and this PISSES ME OFF... a whole lot. I am not Asian, but I do know how to eat with chopsticks, considering I've been eating Asian food my whole life. So... here's a compromise - GIVE ME BOTH. But don't make me ask for chopsticks anymore because like I said... it PISSES ME OFF.   2. Give me napkins. I have, more than once, been left napkinless at this place. This is weird and that leads me to the last one...  3. Stop looking too damn busy for me. You're a RESTAURANT. You WANT people in there. So don't make that look like \"I have so much to do, your water and/or napkin request is really putting me out, and shuffle in and out of the kitchen like you're tired and deathly overworked.\"   No one wants a servant, they want someone who is getting paid (and probably well fed) to serve them a meal, so stop making me feel like I'm asking some slave laborer to make me food. It's horribly disconcerting and I don't ask for extra water, soy sauce, napkins and... my chopsticks sometimes because of it - which takes the dining experience down a notch. Smile at me and say, \"Sure, give me one second.\"  Still, I am well fed, and not entirely unsatisfied and even a tiny bit more satisfied now that you have tofu when I leave this place... feeling horrible guilty and annoyed.",

    "text": "Wandered in here one afternoon, needing a quick meal and thinking that noodles might be better than Greggs or kebab. In retrospect, should have read the Yelp reviews first - and gone for the kebab!  The food itself was fine, if uninspiring. I ordered the veggie ramen and it came out a decent portion with a good amount of veggies and hearty broth, but it lacked flavor. There were no condiments on the tables, so I had to ask for chili oil, and even that didn't help much. Well, for 5 it was a reasonably healthy, decent filler.   The service, however, was plum awful. The place was half-full. We were told to seat ourselves, and after doing so, waited ten minutes to be brought menus and had to finally get up and grab them ourselves. The boy was brought the wrong beer (how does one hear 'Tiger' when asked for 'Asahi'?) After I was done with my food, we tried to catch the eyes of the servers so we could get the bill - and I did a few times, but even after looking at me they continued to ignore us. I finally went up to the counter to pay, and still had to get the girl's attention, although I was standing three feet away from her and she was staring off into space! Throughout our time there, the waitstaff either stood around with blank expressions on their faces or wandered around aimlessly. The kitchen seems to be more efficient, but the waitstaff should be re-trained or simply fired. It was that bad. Next time, kebab.",

Yocoko seems to me to be your typical noodle bar, with fast service and food, perhaps not with the quality of a five star restaurant, but it will be something that keeps you going. What I had was the seafood satay noodles and what I received was a barrel-load of noodles with a healthy enough portion of seafood and vegetables on top. I couldn't even finish half of my plate. It certainly kept me full til dinner. Would I call it top notch food? No, but it filled our bellies while we fought the Fringe crowds.",

We declined and left.  The restaurant was very busy, and has been every time I have been past, which should surely have been a sign of a good restaurant.  Sadly, even if the food is good, the service was so appalling I could not possibly recommend it.  Don't waste your time visiting Yocoko.",

The noodles were also way too oily and the cha siu was sinewy and tasteless.   Service isn't very impressive either but it is a noodle bar and I appreciate quick turnovers having been to many a Cantonese takeaway in different parts of the world. But usually the food is better there and so it's much easier to put up with!   Overall, only eat here if you've totally run out of ideas. Even your frozen Tesco pizza will be a hundred times better.

The noodles were exactly what I was craving: wok-fried, great soy sauce base taste, and lots of chicken, beef, and pork mixed in. Simple and delicious. The rabbit rice came out looking a lot different than how it did on the menu, but it was still cute and I appreciated the effort. The rice was sticky rice in a bed of tomato with egg soup. It was actually really good all together.  The entire meal cost me about 8 and filled me up. The service was friendly and fast, and the restaurant was quiet and a nice place to relax after walking around the city for a while.

Yocoko is characterised by very quick service, great value, and a big selection of food. I generally choose a noodles-based dish, because I love noodles, but there are definitely rice options too.  A huge bonus of Yocoko is the availability of as much green tea as you want free of charge. Combined with the genuinely excellent value on offer in the restaurant, you can easily eat and drink sub 10, which is amazing in central Edinburgh. I also prefer Yocoko over Red Box, for example, as the food comes on plates and the drink in glasses.  Definitely worth a stop.",

    "text": "Popped in here last night on a whim as I was looking for somewhere to meet a friend and have something to eat while waiting. As it happened, friend arrived pretty promptly so we both ended up eating.  It's a largely Chinese-style noodle bar, which in effect means that the menu is pretty standard Chinese-restaurant fare. Although they did offer 'Japanese-style' dishes, don't expect a Wagamama experience.   We both ordered the Japanese mixed vegetable meal, which was a tray with a bowl of rice and mixed veg - disappointingly lacking anything exotic (like mushrooms) - with a teacup-sized bowl of salad almost drowned under a large dollop of what I assume was mayonnaisel a cup of miso soup - not the hearty, seaweed-laced red miso that you get in Wagamama, but a thin, almost clear watery miso with stringy bits of something (egg?) through it. To finish, there was a solitary strawberry on a wee dish sitting forlornly in the corner of the tray. Very odd.  However, it was late and choices were limited here, the place was certainly busy enough, the food was hot and reasonably priced - we both also had a beer and the bill was only 16 so can't really complain. Cheap and cheerful.",

The service is terrible, the place is always cold and giving forks to Western-looking folks and chopsticks to Asian-looking people without giving you the choice is annoying. And just giving you one napkin. Is there a napkin shortage I haven't heard about? Just put the napkins and cutlery on the table and let us do it ourselves! That would mean fewer encounters for the rude staff to endure too. \"One fork, one napkin and one menu,\" as John Lee Hooker didn't sing. Sort it out!  So why do I go back? The food. Absolutely delicious. Under five pounds for a tasty stir fry or soup, with free green tea. Of course I always spend more as I can't resist the crispy chilli beef strips for a starter (see photos).  It's just the kind of place that Edinburgh needed - no frills, cheap and cheerful noodle house in the centre of town. The menu is a crazy concoction of various Asian dishes, but it's better than Wagamama and half the price. The Singapore noodles (with the option of ho fun rather than vermicelli) are fantastic.  I was going to give it 4 stars for the food, but last time I had to eat with my coat on because of the cold and one of the staff was incredibly rude (though the other was very nice). But I'll keep going back for the food . . .",
