I went with three friends as we had 2 for 1 vouchers to use for it. I was surprised it was pay at the till on arrival when you order your food. Not ideal if you were planning a special meal out. With friends it was fine though, and got paying the bill out of the way at the beginning! The prices were great, and the burgers were good. Good not great though, and burgers is all they do. I was slightly disappointed with the less than large size of the burger. The toppings were also more different flavours of sauce rather than actual substantial toppings. The chips were also oven chips. When a restaurant is only selling burgers and chips you would think they could put a bit more effort into the chips. We thought it was okay and would maybe go back again - but only if we have more half price offers.",

Burgers and veggies equals a rice patty which the majority of time has a consistency of lumpy wallpaper paste and the flavour of cardboard. Great, I said, count me in.   Got to give GBK kudos - everyone loved their burgers and best of all for me, I didn't have a burger! Well, it looked like a burger, as in it had a burger bun surrounding it, and it was, as with the other burgers, impaled by a set of spikes. But mine had camembert, rocket, slices of sweet potato, roasted red pepper, aubergine and mushrooms stacked on top of each other, with sweet onion jam to finish it off. Truly delicious.   Technically no you don't get chips with your burger, but I would also point out you have to pay more at MaccyD's as well to get a box of fries, so ok I pay more, but I get something better than what i can get out of the aforementioned establishment. Definitely tastier than your average bear!",

My personal favourites include a quarter pounder with cheese and extra cheese from McDonalds, or a bacon double cheeseburger from Burger King if I'm feeling fancy.  The burgers in this joint shit all over those though. These aren't just reconstituted bits and bobs of Coo or Pig. These are handmade, home made and well made, and you won't get a sniff of a 1.99 happy meal in here.  I ordered the camembert and cranberry chicken burger with salad, which cost 8.15! These burgers are a wee bit pricey but like I said, it is all good stuff. This particular one did not dissapoint and I was absolutely stuffed without any fries, which you couldn't say in any other fast food joint!  I love the idea of modernising fast food, bringing a healthier twist to it whilst still retaining the naughty and deeply satisfying feeling you get when you bite into a greasy beef-burger. Yum Yum!",

The burgers are indeed gourmet, and I can say with confidence that I have never had a better burger than the one I had here.  It's tucked in at the western end of the effortlessly fashionable George Street, and is one of those places that you have to visit for great food in Edinburgh.  The food is main lure for me here.  I am a definite meat-eater, and this sort of place that serves primarily meat is great for me.  I think their menu has changed slightly since I was there last, but when I was there I had a Greek burger.  This was essentially a burger with some feta cheese, salad and some relish.  It was so tasty, and I wish they still did it there, because I would quite happily have it again.  We also got some chunky chips as a side, which were also supremely tasty.  The service was also great, especially considering we were there at the busy lunchtime period.  Food came out without too much of a wait, and the prices are reasonable considering the quality of the food on offer.  It is so refreshing to see a place like this striving to pursue excellence in burrgers, unlike the fast food chains and gastro-pubs, who often do the humble burger a disservice.

We were craving meat and in particular burgers (funny how at some times you know exactly what you want right then and then when presented with a choice you get confused).   Anyway,  we were both super pleased. Their burger quality is excellent, and although Americans in particular will find the price high, for Edinburgh its quite reasonable for George Street area.  Then bun was fresh and the sides were just the right amount. Plus I like my choice of sauces and burger filling and this place sure catered to it.   We arrived at close to closing time, but we weren't turned away- nice for a change to be treated a bit more politely! But do keep that in mind in Scotland, just because it gets dark super late in the summer doesn't mean the kitchen in restaurants will wait for you.",

The clue's pretty much in the name, they serve burgers and not a lot else. But they serve amaaaaazing burgers, that not only have proper cheese on them unlike most fast food places or even some pubs, but the exact type of cheese chosen specifically by you. And that goes for the garnishes, sauces, the bun, how well-done the burger's cooked etc, etc, etc. Basically, if you leave here having just eaten something that you didn't love then you'll have no-one to blame but yourself.  You do pay for the privilege, though. It would need to be one hell of a hangover in my book to justify spending the best part of 20 on a cure for it on too regular a basis...!",

The cheapest burger was 14.95. They did have  great selection though, and it was nice when I went back a second time to experiment with their mint and avocado chicken burger.

    "text": "I have been to other GBK locations (London) and was in the mood for a great burger but I was so disappointed! I typically would have given the other location I visited 4 stars so I had expectations. I ordered a buffalo burger. \"Sorry, no buffalo today.\" So I said I'll take a regular burger with cheddar. Plain. No sauces. No salad. No toppings. And an order of sweet potato fries. \"Sorry, no sweet potato  today\". Ok, onion rings.  So I wait for what seems like an eternity for my burger (and the place only has about 4 tables with customers...mid afternoon) and the burger is wrong and the onion rings are burnt. The burger has lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, mayo and salsa. I send it back and it returns less than a minute later. I asked the waitress if they just scraped off the toppings, to which she answered no but when I lifted the bun, I showed her the remains of the salsa. Walked out without eating lunch. Won't be back to this location.",

    "text": "Have to rate GBK a-ok and it is worth a visit if you are a gluten free peep so you can get a burger in a bun. Yes, a burger in a bun is not a huge deal for most people but when the bun part is usually off limits then this is something to be celebrated...  You order at the till point - great if you are wanting to split bills. Help yourself to free water and monkey nuts - free peanuts are always a winner in my book! We came in at a non-peak time - after 4pm so it was fairly quiet and our food and service was pretty speedy.  It is a chain and as such I don't think the offerings will ever be mind blowing as formulaic food rarely is, but for me, my burger (cheese and bacon) was decent. The burger was moist, not grisly and still slightly pink in the middle. My bun was decent enough too - fairly soft and was ok for holding together, unlike a lot of GF rolls which disintegrate when you take that first bite.  They do an app as well so you give your app number to the server and it gives you points to build up to free stuff so this would be worthwhile if you are a regular.   I can't see me going to GBK all the time, but anytime I fancy a burger in a gluten free bun then I'll pop in here as other places are woefully inadequate at offering this.",

    "text": "I have come here once or twice before and have been happy with the burgers.  This is my first yelp review on this place so I would give it 3 stars as it could do with some adjustments.   Firstly tables are a tad crowded for what you order and with two people at the table it is \"COSY\".   It's counter service so the man had to wait in a queue to order, that seemed to take a wee while.  Everything came within about 15mins and i was starving.  The burger was tasty and moist adn the rosemary ultra skinny fries were yummy too!  I got a \"welcome dip\" with the GBK app, so opted for the blue cheese but that could of been a little less lumpy as the fries sometimes broke whilst dipping.    It was busy but we weren't rushed but felt watched as the interior is like a hallway, people often hovered whilst waiting for to pass waitiers or other people and got knocked a few times on the chair mainly from other customers even although there was space to pass.  The bench was hard and very unfortable to sit on after a while - I'm glad my man sat on it whilst i choose the chair!  I have to give the food the points, as the experience was meh - serivce was good though.  it was just the seating arrangements really quibbled me.  It's not put me off going back - I will just my table and time a little better next time!",

This is probably my favourite burger I have had anywhere in the world, and that's comparing it to the truly awesome burger I had today in Brooklyn, at 67 Burger!   The Taxi Driver is served in a brioche bun with American cheese, a crispy onion ring, cajun relish, smoked chilli mayo and salad. It is an awe-inspiring combination of flavours that delivers every time, and I think I've had it about 4 times since it was created in January!  Also on my most recent two visits, the waiter has been superb. I always find the staff here are super friendly and helpful.",

I love a good burger now and again, it has to be my favourite comfort food, especially partnered with a side of piping hot chippies.   Everything on the menu was appealing to me so I really struggled with what to go for, so much so that it probably took a good 15 minutes before I finally made up my mind. In addition to regular beef burgers they also had a great selection of chicken burgers and vegetarian options too. I finally decided to go for the \"Mexican\" burger which was delicious and absolutely massive, I was absolutely full to bursting after I'd polished it off.   For the size of the burgers I think they charge a reasonable price and if you're looking for comfort food that is slightly more adventurous than your average burger, give this place a whirl.",

Large Budvar at 5.10 (rashly ordered on sight rather than after looking at the menu) is a rip-off and whilst the burger prices are just the right side of acceptable in places that serve chips and salad as standard they're a tad high for a burger with just the bun and sauce.   I'd been here once before over a year ago and only went back this weekend as I'd a voucher as hadn't been overly impressed the first time. Service was fine although the bloke on till duty was a mumbler. Waitresses were sparky and unobtrusive. The quality of meat in my Wellington burger was obviously good but the thing itself had clearly been sitting out a while in the kitchen before collection as it wasn't very hot so I'd have been happy to wait a little longer for it to arrive on the table if the temperature was going to be right.   Not likely I'll be back in a hurry although I do have another couple of vouchers.",

They were savvy enough to recognise that people like to eat burgers in burger joints, but don't necessarily want to lower their standards by stepping over the threshold of a branch of McDonalds or Burger King.  The burgers at GBK are made from quality meat; wild boar and buffalo options are available alongside the more traditional Aberdeen Angus beef. There are lots of exciting toppings to choose from too; beetroot, avocado, thai red curry and houmous, all feature on an extensive list. Everything is cooked freshly to order and they even cater for vegetarians with five different veggie options (the puy lentil one is really good).   This is fast food that begs to be savoured.",

Again being a lover of meat I was really hoping this place would prove to be an awesome burger salvation.  I was ok, it jkust fails to hit the high notes. They get so much right it really is a shame, the service is fantastic - the girls interact with the customers and helpfully advise on their favourites and suggestions.  I had the Pestorica or something to that effect, burger with relish, pesto mozzarella etc. Also had a side of onion rings with dips.  The burger when it comes is visually fantastic and seems huge, the pedto and mozzarella are great, the salad fine. To the burger - its just too thin. When you order they make a point of saying are you happy for the burger to be cooked medium, to which i smiled and said medium rare is fine by me!!  The burger is far too think to maintain a juicy redish centre that I was hoping to see and lacks a bit of seasoning.  The onion rings are dipped in corn flour and fried, i prefer a batter as it sticks to the onion better, these were crumbly and greasy and just not what i had hoped for.  To finish I had an oreo milk shake which was awesome to the max!   This place could be the best burger joint in town but for now sadly they are letting themselves down!!",
