    "text": "We went here since we kept walking by it due to location to our hotel. They had the menu posted in the window and had lots of options.   We walked in and it was pretty empty. Only one other table. A man came out to help us and seemed surprised by the traffic?  I ordered a bagel sandwich (cheese, egg, bacon). Said bagels would come with salad and tortilla crisps. Came with just salad. I also asked for water and got only bottled and wasn't given the option for just tap.   The food was mediocre. I didn't like that bacon and come to find out later that I'm not a fan of Scottish bacon. It is not like American bacon - it's more hammy/Canadian bacon.   The service was also sub par. We had to track the guy down to pay and get out.",

    "text": "A place in the business of selling food for the hard-earned ought to at least be acquainted with the concept of flavor.  Neither my missus nor I were willing to waste our appetite on more than a bite of our breakfast.  I ordered the potato scone roll, a flavorless pair of flat wedges served between halves of an entirely flavorless soft roll. No sauce, no dressing, no seasoning of any kind that I could discern. I'm a broad-minded traveler, but am challenged to imagine that a total absence of flavor is the intent of this dish.  The missus regrettably ordered the pancakes, tough little discs better suited for flinging at the park than placing in the palette.  The tea was weak, too.  Major bummer.",

    "text": "Having done the touristy bit with our friends visiting from the states, we had our fill of pub food so we were in search of something along the lines of sandwiches or paninis.  Zaza's was right next to the apartment we were renting for a few days so we decided to check it out.  The menu posted outside the cafe had plenty of choices for everyone, including veggies.  We decided to pop in, there was one guy sitting at the window with a sandwich and coffee type drink, but otherwise, the place was empty.  We sat down and a rather friendly guy came over and handed us some menus and took our drink order.  We were all fairly easy and each went with some sort of wrap or panini.  I wanted a zaza's special wrap in panini form and the guy making the food was happy to accommodate.  It came with chicken, pesto, roasted veg, cheese and onions.  I just wanted a toasted sandwich, but later realised that their wraps were pressed in the panini press, so either way, I would have gotten a toasted sandwich.    All of our sandwiches came with a side salad and we all ordered chips.  The chips were fresh made and everything was so delicious.  We were very happy to have stopped in this wee cafe and left just full enough to be able to have ice cream next door.    Quick note, they are cash only and the only ATM nearby charges almost 2 quid to withdraw money.  Luckily we all had cash.",

I brought my two kids here as we were tired of walking and they were starving and the other places recommended on yelp were full up. I wasn't initially too excited but the kids were happy enough. However I found my wrap, which they toasted was lovely and the chicken nuggets the kids ordered looked homemade. There is a great view of the castle and the service was friendly. They gave my kids sweets :)",
