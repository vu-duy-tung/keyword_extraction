    "text": "Boom! Gotta love a two star jump!  I found myself in this area today and near famished... apparently, walking 30 minutes turns me into a food zombie. There are a few usual suspects on Leith Walk that I would usually stop into but I needed 1. wifi 2. a place to kill an hour and a half between meetings and 3. somewhere borderline healthy, as I knew in my hangry state that I was likely to over eat and get sleepy (I'm basically a giant toddler you guys...). I remembered having stopped here for coffee and as it was right around the corner from my next meeting, made my way here.  This time around, I skipped the coffee completely, having been underwhelmed the first time. Instead I got a sparkling water alongside a greek salad and pita & hummus... and with that little meal, found my new go-to spot on the walk. The salad was a great size with PROPER feta and big chunks of fresh veggies. I love the fact that they serve it with olive oil and balsamic on the side, so you can choose to dress it to your taste - so many greek salads go overboard with dressing and it ruins it. I could have eaten an entire plate of the grilled bread that comes on the side as well. The pita and hummus was the perfect add on though the portion of hummus is way to big to eat solo (think of being served a store bought tub size of hummus in one sitting...). Finished things off with a cup of tea while I plunked away on my computer. It was quick, cheap(ish), friendly and both healthy but totally satisfying. The free wifi is a nice perk and the place wasn't busy, so it was a good place to get some work done. It's not fancy or anything out of the ordinary, but it's a great lunch spot and I'm a total fan.  Tip: bring cash if you can as they charge extra to use debit/credit.",

    "text": "I had no idea that Qupi was actually a Greek cafe - I would have probably popped in sooner had I known. Oh well, better late than never!  It was lunch time and I wanted a feta cheese and spinach pie AKA spanakopita. A friendly gentleman took my order and the pie was heated up in a large oven. It was accompanied by a little side salad.   Really enjoyed the spanakopita - very tasty feta spinach filling inside filo pastry. Just how it should be!  When you step inside Qupi, the place is a bit more bigger than what it seems from outside. Few tables in the back.   The menu also has Croques e.g. Croque Monsiuer etc.. Nice, as this is not a regular item in many cafes.",

    "text": "This is cool little Greek Cafe, and I have to say that the food was sooo delicious!!   We had 2 sharing platters ( Yes we are fatties!!) One was a a mix of hummus, Aubergine salad, bread & the other with bread, Pork , fries.....it was just lovely. The girls who served us were very friendly and i particularly loved the cafe decor... it had a fun ecletic mix of chairs at the back, zebra , leopard print. It also had some interesting masks on the wall and an array of hats hanging from the ceiling. Not expensive and the only reason i am not awarding it 5 stars is because i felt cold, the front of the cafe is much warmer.  Go visit if you are in the Leith area!! :)",

    "text": "Qupi cafe is a cosy, unusual little cafe situated in the part of Leith that is a bit devoid of cultural offerings (sorry, it has to be said).  So this place shines out like a wee gem! Always crowded but not overrun, the constant custom stands as a testament to how popular Qupi is amongst locals and passers by. It sells some delicious Greek food, not to mention the usual cafe and afternoon tea offerings. Food is served up piping hot and brimming with goodness.  There is definitely a rustic but also continental feel to this cafe, and I got the impression everything in here was homemade on the day since it was so fresh. For the quality of the food, the prices are surprisingly low. The staff are very friendly, attentive and sharp, so you're not lingering about waiting to be served for ages. On the contrary, I felt well looked after.  This is the kind of place I delight in bringing a book to and setting myself up for an afternoon of reading. No matter how busy it is there is something relaxed about this homely, quirky cafe and it has a charming appeal that will see me coming back next time I'm in this neck of the woods!",

    "text": "Excellent little cafe with, as another reviewer put it, a \"continental feel\". Nice array of sandwiches, platters and cakes on offer. Nice breakfasts and very decent coffee. Cosy inside with a quirky but comfortable decor and very friendly service. I've been twice and each time, I had one of their generous baguettes, filled with hummus or feta and olives. A tasty side vegetable salad featuring beets and a simple dressing came with it. The baguettes are  delish and good value for money. This was no skimpy sandwich. Give it a try.",

    "text": "To quote Marj, this is most definitely an 'unusual little cafe' in Leith, which left me quite surprised at what it was offering.  I wandered past here when a rather plump gentleman was sitting outside with a plate of sandwiches that would feed the 5000. I walked all the way down and round the bottom streets of Leith and when I came back, he was still there polishing off the last round. He seemed to be loving it so I thought why not?  It was busy when I went in but I managed to grab a wee table at the back and had a look at the menu. The food here is Greek, and there is a good sized selection at that. I decided to go for a hummus and chickpea pitta with chicken and it was delicious. I had a lovely creamy coffee too which was great and served piping hot.  A nice wee cafe, but my only criticism is it could do with a bit of a facelift!",

    "text": "The sheer amount of times I have passed this place on the bus and wondered how to correctly pronounce the name is the main reason one day I got off the bus and threw cautuon to the wind and headed into Qupi.   The cafe itself is a little bit on the shabby side, and very small. The food is an eclectic mix of greek and traditional cafe fare. I'm not sure that this combination works together, but judging by the sheer number of people who passed in and out of the doors as I sat eating goes to show that some people must really appreciate this place.   The staff were friendly and very efficiant, managing to get through customers like a machine gun through tissue paper. Rather impressive.  As for the pronunciation of the name, I'm still not sure.",

There wasn't any room for me to sit down inside and the seats were wet from the rain shower earlier in the day, so I decided to eat it on the bus (homeless style!)  I could have sworn they left the bread out in the rainstorm, it was wetter than a sponge, I could only eat a few bites then I had to throw it away. It was a shame because the filling was beautiful.

Don't bothered with sitting in, its cold and damp through the back, and it smells a bit odd in the front. The salad you get is just odd (american mustard as a dressing???) and there's not really anything special about the place.   the staff are friendly, and the service is pretty damn fast, so qupi definitely has its good points.",
