    "text": "I was really in the mood for some fish and chips, but I live just far enough from the nearest chippy to make it unreasonable to walk, as the food would be cold by the time I got home. For this reason, I was delighted to find Stefano's could be ordered from online. The menu selection is good and the prices are decent too, as is the free delivery! I ordered my fish supper and was given an estimated delivery time of 35 minutes from order- fine, I thought. However, after paying, the time suddenly changed to an hour after ordering, and I was quite annoyed. Indeed, the hour time provided turned out to be accurate, and I sat waiting for my food for far too long. When it eventually arrived, the food tasted fine. The chips were very good, the fish only okay. I ate it all, of course, but it just wasn't worth the hour wait.  Maybe a fresh fish supper picked up from Stefano's would be great, but overall, I don't recommend ordering from here for delivery.",
