I hope it survives, though, because this was such a special meal, truly different.  Every bite was sensational.   Definitely worth a visit.  Fast!",

Food: Very nice combinations, balanced dishes in their taste and their presentation. Every ingredient served in our table found its good combination with the rest. Wine: Was a joy to drink that wine together with the rest.  Dessert: A nice surprise.  Strongly recommended. Look forward to return here!",

The food was so-so and hardly special. The staff was worse. I arrived at the restaurant early (I had a 6:30 reservation) but was made to wait. I was told the place only opened at 6:30 pm. That was fine except a couple that came after me - before 6:30 and well before their 6:45 appointment - was immediately seated.   When I finally got a table, I was told I should be done by 8:30 as the table was already booked for that time. Seriously???  An Edinburgh local told me he did not think much of 21212. Now I know why.",

    "text": "On our first night in Edinburgh we decided to try 21212.  The service was outstanding, but unfortunately most of the meal left us underwhelmed.  We were greeted by two very friendly and hospitable hostesses, and the service throughout the night was equally friendly and hospitable.  There seemed to be some confusion over where we were to be seated, but it was cleared up quickly and we were seated at a table in the dining room. The dining room is well appointed, and the tables are not too crowded.  However, if you are shy about having the table next to yours being able to hear your conversation, this might not be the place for you, as the setting is very intimate, and several tables share a common bench as one side of the seating.  The dinner menu was straightforward, and we were informed that the menu changes weekly, which impressed us both.    The wine list was good, and, although I wouldn't describe it as extensive, they offered a variety of bottles, as well as a pairing for each course.  The sommelier however did not offer any suggestions to us, which was a bit surprising, considering this is advertised as a \"haven for wine lovers\" on the restaurants website. I would have expected the sommelier to approach us and offer a suggestion, or, at the very least, speak to us, but he did neither.   The amuse bouche was creative, but the texture was not appealing.  For our first courses, my husband and I each tried a different dish, but neither of us were impressed. The textures for both dishes were off (both dishes included a foam type element that was very sour, and one dish included raw onion, which wrecked our palates).  Our second course, a spring vegetable soup, was also not what we hoped for.  My husband described the soup course as very foamy and acidic. For the third course, we both opted for the steak dish.  My husband's was modified to exclude shellfish, but the portion size was equal to mine. Although we were not given any option as to how our steak was cooked, it was tasty.  The fourth course was a delicious cheese plate, but we commented that the cheese itself was probably not made in the restaurant, so we weren't really eating the chef's creation. The fact that we were most impressed with the cheese plate was unfortunate, considering it most likely wasn't the chef's creation, and we believe the price of the meal warranted more in terms of flavor.  Dessert, the fifth course, was tasty, but didn't blow us away.  For a restaurant with a Michelin star, we expected more.     All in all, the service was excellent, and we enjoyed our third, fourth and fifth courses.  The first two courses though were not at all what we expected, and we were disappointed.  We would not go back, but we would not discourage others from trying the restaurant.  It is advertised as being unique, and that is certainly what you get.",

    "text": "I am a very very lucky girl. I was taken here as a surprise birthday treat for dinner and an overnight stay last weekend, I have a wonderful boyfriend I know.   Although I have done fine dining, this was my first michelin star dining experience, wow! It started with a bottle of champagne in the room. We stayed in room no. 21 on the top floor (there are only 4 rooms) which has beautiful views over the city and out towards the firth of forth. There's quite a lot of stairs which was no problem for us but just in case anyone reading this struggles with stairs. The room has been decorated beautifully with a massive bed, luxurious shower room and a lovely sitting area with window seats that allow you to take in the amazing views. Only criticism would be that there was quite a lot of mirrors - I don't usually like seeing so much of myself!  We got ready for dinner and headed down to the drawing room for a complimentary glass of champagne. As others have noted, the decor is a beautiful and understated boutique hotel. I loved the custom made carpets. They do seem to have a things for urns...  They only do 2 seatings in the evening - an early and a late one. We were on the late one. We were due to be seated at 930, and it was about 945 before we were taken down to the restaurant and, ironically, bumped into old friends in the restaurant who we stopped and talked to so it was about 10 before we ordered (our fault I know).   The menu is intriguing and dishes have names that aren't immediately obvious as to what they are - so there is guess work involved! At the weekend, its a set 5 course menu with a choice for course 1 (starter), 3 (main) and 5 (dessert). I chose cauliflower cheese, steak and lemon tart.   I have never seen such beautiful and imaginative dishes. You can see through to the restaurant and there is a large team of chefs working - it's amazing to see how they prepare dishes - each chef is responsible for a garnish on the dish and they all come together at once as its being plated. It reminds me of a closh!  The stand out for me was the steak for the main, absolutely amazing dish and beautifully presented. Sorry, I don't do food photos so can't show you how stunning it was!!  Cheese was next and that was fabulous. Eight types of cheese so a great range and portion wasn't too big. By the time dessert came I'm afraid it was late and we were both pretty full so we really struggled. Plus we're not dessert people so I'm afraid wasted on us and we didn't manage to finish.  By that time, too late for coffee so finished it off with a wee whisky in the drawing room. The whisky selection is ok but we're whisky buffs so probably hard to please.   It was a truly stunning experience and I couldn't fault the service, the food, the wine or the surroundings. The only downside was the lateness of it all but I guess that's our fault for going for the late seating. It was about 12.30 by the time we finished dinner which is a bit late for us. In hindsight, I would go for the early one.   Although I would call this a once in a lifetime experience, I really hope it isn't!",

We sat in the drawing room with a G&T whilst waiting for our table. Lovely surroundings but I was slightly underwhelmed by the Gin selection. Good. But not great.  We were then later sat. The dinner room stuck with understated elegance. Big windows infront of the kitchen are always a nice touch. I liked it.  I shall not recount every single little thing we ate. But I can tell you one thing - every morsel of food we had here..... was.... incredible. 5 courses of truly incredible food..... with a couple of wee treats inbetween courses.  As you would expect. The portions are not massive. But we left feeling very satisfied but not uncomfortably full.   There is no better way to end the review. We recieved our bill -  2 years ago I would have been gobsmacked by the price of it. But..... my response was, you know what, that is very reasonable considering it is without a doubt some of the best food I have ever eaten. And that makes it worth every penny. A great treat.",

It turned out to be one of the best meals I have had in a lifetime.  The pictures of dishes do not do this justice.  We selected the 3-course menu, and my daughter and I ordered different dishes through-out.  Each dish was consisted of a melody of flavor and texture - all were excellent. We were never rushed and the service was outstanding.  And the decor is fantastic as well!  The travel guide should have rated 21212 as outstanding.

The vegetarian soup was an absolute surprise in terms of the depth of flavors and variety of textures. The Guinea fowl in my main melted in my mouth while the duck bacon was inspired. The cheese plate was wonderful and I would have preferred to end the meal there and then instead of having a proper pudding. But there's no need to quibble over a largely perfect meal.

This wasn't my first time here though and the fact that it is my favorite restaurant that I've ever been to I imagine played a part in the setting for the proposal.  But onto the less mushy stuff- I have been to a few of the Michelin starred restaurants in Edinburgh and whilst I enjoyed the others, 21212 is the only one I would continually return to.  The first thing about the restaurant is that is comparatively small (I think around 6-8 tables), the staff are also very down to earth as well as exceptionally polite and professional- no stuffiness at all which makes a refreshing change from most Michelin starred establishments (we happily chatted to our waitress about Asda!). As for the food, I find it genuinely innovative, it's never what you expect and each mouthful is totally different and equally delightful. You get a view of the kitchen which seems very calm and happy (no Gordon R style shouting here!) and you will often see the main man.  I've been here for occasions (birthdays etc) and each time we've got a personally signed card from the owners which is a lovely touch.  I've also been lucky enough to stay in one of their boutique hotel rooms and it's absolute five star luxury where the bathroom is as big as the bedroom and yes I did indulge in champagne and a bubble bath big enough to have a swim in!",

They have a Michelin star so they could be pretentious or rude, better than you and not needing your service, but they weren't, very welcoming and not stuffy in the least.  You pay a good price but it is worth it (for me, a once a year kind of meal with my wife). 5 courses, small portions but they give you little snack things as you go that are included although not on the menu.  Bottom line, the cheese plate was first class and all of the courses are as good as I've had.  I eat out a lot, it's actually part of my job, and this place was special.",

Each course was structured so to create a different combination of flavors and textures with every bite.      Tasty and innovative cuisine.  Gorgeous building and decor.  Attentive service.  Upscale ambience.  Expensive but well worth the money.  Go!!!",
