    "text": "Nice Chinese takeaway just opposite the meadows in Summerhall. Summerhall Kitchen has some of the best value of the Chinese takeaways in the area, with a main course with rice coming in well below 6. The choice is extensive, and they work with both Just Eat and Hungry House, so ordering online is simple.  We were a group of 5 hanging out in a friend's flat, when we decided to order from Summerhall Kitchen, at the recommendation of one of the group. We ordered on Just Eat and were given an estimated delivery time (around 45 minutes later, if I remember correctly). When the food arrived (earlier than predicted), it was all hot, fresh, and tasted great. The portion sizes are definitely large enough to make a good meal, and some of the less ravenous members of the group even managed to have some lunch for the next day.  All in all, it was a good experience, and I will definitely be trying Summerhall Kitchen again in the future. Recommended.",

    "text": "Another standard Chinese takeaway. I feel bad for places like Summerhall Kitchen sometimes, they are small, independent, trying to compete with the many, many other takeaways. But at the same time, the greasy, poor quality, probably not remotely Chinese food always gets to me.   Summerhall Kitchen offers the usual array of takeaway standards. There is a big menu, but that usually means the ingredients aren't fresh (another staple of a cheap takeaway). They do offer some money saving offers like the student deal for two at 13.50, and they also offer a 10% student discount.  Overall this place isn't that expensive, but at 4-6 for a dish, you could still go elsewhere for far better quality.",

    "text": "This is not a particularly good Chinese takeaway. It is greasy, not massively cheap and for some reason it takes ages for even the simplest dish. As the other guys have already said the spring rolls are terrible, but surprisingly the duck spring rolls aren't actually that bad. I have no idea how there is such a difference but Chinese takeaways are often a mystery to me. The noodles are average and for an extra 10p you can have them in sweet chilli sauce which is actually quite nice.  Overall the food is pretty average and what you would expect from a takeaway but the thing that ruined it for me was the service. The young guy there is ok but the older woman is really rude and comes across as being really patronising. This was compounded by the fact that when I got home I realised she had written down my order wrong and I had a mix of what I wanted and another rogue dish. Grumble grumble",

    "text": "This Chinese takeaway in Newington has nice, friendly service and is in a great location, but some of the food isn't quite up to the standard which you would expect for the prices you pay.  The menu has a good range of authentic Chinese dishes and the place has a pretty good atmosphere inside.  I went for the vegetable spring rolls followed by the crispy Hoisin duck.  It took a fair while to arrive, but there were enough tabloid newspapers to keep us amused as we waited. The springrolls were tasty inside, yet the pastry was a bit greasy and almost wet.  The Hoisin sauce for the duck was delicious, but the duck itself was beyond crispy and verging on tough.  Although the meal wasn't disastrous, I've had better takeaways in Edinburgh.",

I ordered duck spring rolls and king prawn noodles with Thai chili sauce. The spring rolls contained no duck as far as I could tell, just vegetables, while the noodles were plain noodles, prawns and bean sprouts with the chili sauce dumped on top in the tub, not even mixed through.",
