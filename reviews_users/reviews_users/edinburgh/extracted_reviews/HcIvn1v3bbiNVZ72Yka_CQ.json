    "text": "The good things about this restaurant is the food and staff. The food was of a very high quality. The menu is enormous which makes it difficult to choose. We were a group of 5 and I sampled all of the different dishes and enjoyed them all. The aromatic duck was stunning and much bigger than what we thought it would be. I really enjoy chinese food so I ate plenty. The staff were very attentive and professional. The restaurant is very neat and quite fancy, despite this the customers were a mixture of casual and what looked like business. They also operate as a takeaway which is at the entrance. Another positive is the way the staff dealt with a cat walking in. No shouting or shooing, it was picked up and put outside. Not sure if it's a regular occurrence but as a cat lover this didn't bother me. It was very funny.  Now my one negative is that the food took forever to arrive. It was actually quite unbearable. The staff were good about it, apologising every so often for our wait and then making sure we had enough to drink. I was aware that we weren't the only ones waiting so I'll assume that as the food was very good, that it just takes time.  Overall this is a very nice restaurant. The prices of the dishes do vary quite a bit. But with such a large menu I think there is something for everyone.",

    "text": "This is a brilliant Chinese, tucked on Atholl Place.  On a Monday evening after a few drinks we wanted a Chinese meal. Many are closed on Monday's. Chinatown was open and, so it seems, rather busy.  it turned out that due to the fresh cooking of the meals, there was a slight back log in the kitchen. However we were duly informed and supplied with some complimentary starters for the wait.   It is well worth the wait. As I explained, they cook most of their meals from fresh and that is something you can easily taste when eating.   Service is good, but as they were stretched, some people got tired of waiting and left.  They missed some good food.   It is not often I give good reviews on delayed service, but they handled it very well and the quality was undisputable.   Give them a try one day, they may surprise you.",

    "text": "This is an overlooked but quality Chinese quite close to Haymarket. Their customer base has suffered due to the horrendous tram works unfortunately so I'm writing this to remind everyone it's still there! China Town used to be based up in Newington for many years and was my favourite lunch place ever when I worked over that way (I was kinda glad when they moved as I got quite fat!). The lady owner is really friendly and welcoming and remembers every face that used to come to her old place.   I'm giving it 3 stars as the service is friendly, it's a great place to come post rugby in larger groups, I often get a takeaway on my way to the train station (mega speedy) and the food really tasty. They are happy to make anything off menu too including my favourite chicken and beansprouts. The wine selection is pretty good too. Can't beat a Chinese restaurant that sells a good Chablis!",

    "text": "Please see update about this restaurant below. China Town used to be our local in Newington before it moved to the West End and we were gutted to see it go. It's food is second to none and it's list of awards shows for this. The choice of food is excellent and the restaurant itself is beautifully designed. It's very peaceful (unless there's a huge party in) and you are not rushed through your meal like many chinese restaurants. I highly recommend their dumplings and sweet n sour dishes. We still get food delivered from here when we can but they limit how far they travel for take-out at weekends. Sadly we discovered this when we phoned to check and they said yes, but then changed their minds when we phoned with the order and said they wouldn't as they were too busy.  UPDATE  we had take-out from here recently and the quality was really poor. ? Has changed hands ? Food was greasy and tasteless. Sadly won't be going back here anytime soon.",

We weren't hungry enough for the set menu's (coming in at 20 was good value though) so we ordered A La Carte. I got the Spicy Rib's on recommendation from the waitress.   It was alright, the meat was tender but the sauce was a little too salty for my tastes so I left half of it.",

    "text": "China Town is an unassuming little Chinese restaurant in one of the beautiful streets of Edinburgh's West End. The food is absolutely delicious (not greasy or tasteless) and the service cannot be faulted. It is obviously a little more expensive than your average Chinese takeaway, but it is well and truly worth every penny. Pay it a visit, you won't be disappointed.",
