The woman who served me couldnt have made less of an effort.  I love going to cafes and Im pretty easy going, but when you screw everything up; coffee, food orders and compound it by being bitchy and nasty, that is one step to far. Unprofessional and incompetent. Not how anyone wants to start their day I would think. Wont be bothering with this place again.",

The daily baked bread is always excellent  their Pain de Campagne is my regular choice but they often surprise me with specials such as Corn Bread (yellow and crispy  makes great toast) or something new like their Dark Rye Sourdough (crescent shaped and great with pate). I'm happy to sit in their mini cafe for a croissant and coffee on a morning  and though I've not been in for more substantial food their new breakfast menu looks great (baked eggs with chorizo anyone?) and the salad display looks super fresh. Finally the cakes. the cakes! From fancy French entremets to generous frangipani tarts to chocolate and courgette cake  go, drool and enjoy!",

A wide range of items from the classic croissanterie to more dainty cakes and gateaux that could easily be served as desert after a dinner. There are a few tables and chairs so that you can also sit in and have a coffee and cake. However as the place has become more well known you need a bit of luck to get a place. Still, you can always buy cakes to take home. They also bake a good range of interesting continental breads such as olive or onion breads. A bit off the beaten track but well worth seeking out.",

    "text": "The Manna House is a gem. There's something about that area of Easter Road- where even the shops who have the goods to act pretentious- aren't. Its appreciated. A wide array of breads dominates the baskets behind the counter- pumpkin being one of the seasonally loafs that we sampled recently, and the sour dough which is a stalwart in our household. There are a few tables scattered around- definitely an enjoyable place to have a coffee, but its the cakes that grab your attention. The cakes are pristine and fill a three or four shelved glass case. They are of Parisian standard but what sets them apart is their inventiveness. A shooting star in the center of one if trailed by a string of red currents that comes out of the pastry- this must be seen to be understood. The quirky playing about with patisserie and aesthetics is delightful: and I rarely use the word delightful. You could easily expect to pay triple the price tag of the Manna House for less-inventive ideas- but there's the thing- the lack of pretension. This is the thing: you could have your pain au choclat, or croissant and a cappucinno, you could read Cahiers du Cinema and pretend you are in fact in Paris, and the food would abet you in this daydream. But the prices and the attitude is strictly Easter Road. An optimistic sign for the future of Edinburgh baking.",

    "text": "I popped by the Manna House on Saturday, after a tasty lunch down the street.  The Man and I fancied something sweet and one of their macadamia nut brownies looked like it would hit the spot.  The Man waited outside while I got in line aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand waited.  And waited and waited and waited and waited.  I was just the 4th person in line, but I was there for about 10 minutes (it felt like 20 but it couldn't have been that long).  This was partially because when I first arrived there was only one girl helping customers (specifically, one customer with a huge order), while another member of staff swaned in and out of the place, mobile phone in hand.  Ok sure he could have been on a break but I'm not convinced it's best to take a break in the middle of the Saturday lunch rush when there is only one other person working and the line snakes out the door.    When I *finally* was able to place my order I had one bit of oddness in that I was charged 60p more than the listed price, and another bit of oddness when I realised that I paid 2.60 for a \"macadamia nut brownie\" that had, in total, one (whole) macadamia nut in it.  Surely they should be chopped up in dispersed through the brownie?  That being said, it was a very tasty (albeit horrifically expensive) brownie, served in a cutely decorated (and freakishly hot) little cafe.  So.. yeah.  The Manna House isn't conveniently located for me anyway, but if it was, I would come back to try their breads but probably stay away from the sweets.",

The service was brilliant, very friendly and made me smile. However the coffee buttercream cup I had chosen did not make me smile that much.

I could barely hold back but decided to wait until I got home and have my cake with a cuppa tea. The smell was killing me!  I was glad I waited.

I had a vastly indifferent stuffed flatbread whilst sitting in, but took a couple of cakes home for me and the boy. THe raspberry and chocolate mousse was too sweet without much depth of flavour (raspberry mousse, very light, drowned out by heavier chocolate mousse) but the fruit tart for the boy looks fab. But, where the review starts inching up to a four, is in the loaf of bread I picked up - olive and coriander. Dude, I tell ya, that is a taste sensation. Light lemon notes with the salty olive base... oh yes, this is something new and therefore exciting for me. Went lovely with some smoked salmon and grubh dhu. So, Manna House, if you asked me if I liked your baked goods, I'd give a 'meh' response but in terms of your bread 'hurray'!",

    "text": "I was first introduced to The Manna House by my best friend. I went round for breakfast and she has a loaf of their chocolate bread to round off our breakfast, it was lovely. Not overly chocolatey that it was sickly, but chocolately enough to provide that lovely chocolate hit. It was also, pleasantly moist and a generous sized loaf for its price tag.   So it followed, I was at my friend's house just off Easter Road, and needed to pick up a few things to take home for lunch as my parent were visiting. I left laden with bags full of lovely things for just a smidge over 15 and it was truly excellent value.   First up, the red lentil soup went down a treat. Wonderfully seasoned and full of chunks of veg.   The cheese and bacon croissants were delicious, just the right balancewas struck between the bacon and the cheese. The croissant was light, airy and crisp.   I also had the Mediterranean Cheese Swirl. This was also, crisp, light and airy and tasted beautiful.   We rounded off lunch with cakes. I had a blueberry cupcake. The blueberry cupcake alone is enough to earn The Manna House its 5 stars. I love cakes but this took it to a whole new level. The Manna House's Blueberry Cupcake is truly unparalleled. It is truly spectacular and I would urge everyone to try it now, if not sooner. The sponge is the softest you will ever encounter. The icing was as light as air, it tasted like it had been made with fresh blueberries and was just perfect. Not too sickly, as icing can sometimes be. All topped off with a fresh blueberry. Just perfect.   My mum had the Raspberry Cupcake which she also raved about. My dad had the carrot cake, which although I didn't try, it also looked delicious. Some of the carrot cake's icing had rubbed off on to my cupcake so I got a taste and it was awesome.   The service was also quick, friendly, professional and personal which was pleasing considering how busy it was. The girl serving us was also patient as I kept asking for more and more items. I really can't recommend The Manna House highly enough.",

This is a small bakery with limited seats and a lot of people stop by here every morning to get breakfast, coffee / tea and also grab takeaway lunch.  They have a good selection of bread, patisserie & savoury food for lunch.  They also do cakes which you can pre-order.  A few years ago my friend bought a flourless chocolate cake from here and it was heaven!  The coffee is as good as artisan coffee and the patisserie are to die for.  We tried a custard type patisserie with puff pastry and it tasted really fresh and went down well with our coffee.  The patisserie and bread are made fresh everyday.  Hence, you can see why there are a lot of people who love coming here for their breakfast.",

I ended up ordering a latte and one of their lemon tarts. Both were quite tasty.   I'm fairly certain that they're popular among the locals because as I was sitting at my table there was a steady stream of people coming in and out for soups and sandwiches as well as pastries. Additionally, when iw arrived their shelves were very empty which makes me think that it's the kind of place you should get to early! All in all all lovely experience.",

Manna House is located on Easter Road and I remember when it opened up in 2005. Back then they only had a few breads to start with and 'less of everything'. The cafe has since evolved and they now serve breakfasts and lunches as well. There is only problem - they are not the most spacious of places, so often there is a queue to the door as locals pick up breads and cakes and coffees.   I usually make a pit stop here on my way to TK Maxx and often have the porchetta sandwich which is served on 'donker brot' roll. They sell this variety as a bread, but I think it works better as a roll. They don't sell these rolls here, but I enquired about it and they advised to place an order the previous day and they would happily set aside some rolls to buy.  Manna House has an amazing selection of cakes and patisserie. It's maybe not the most cheapest of places, but as an occasional treat this place works like magic.",

The bakery has a high turnover thanks to the continental morning offerings, interesting looking salads and highly quality produce. The cafe is quite rustic in style and the outdoor seating reminds me of a Parisian cafe.   There are numerous pastries, pretty cakes, a good selection of bread (the charcoal intrigued me). The ginger cake here is delicious and not overly sweet, as is True of some cake competition in town (I am looking at you Lovecrumbs...)  I have tried a few pastries here, some are delicious (the apple bomb FTW) whereas others seem to be a bit on the dry side (chocolate custard filled croissant wasn't doing much for me or my friend). The espresso shot is humungous. It's already more than a double shot so don't go and do what I did and ask for a double.   The prices here are very reasonable, on the low side for Edinburgh, high side for Leith.",

The tables aren't spaced out fantastically - mainly because the place is so small - but it's a nice spot all the same. The staff are *very* good looking...just, y'know, if you were looking for some eye candy with your coffee...but they totally know it.  There's a huge selection of pastries and cakes to go with the delicious fresh bread on sale. There's salads too and a lot of people seem to get take away.  Although it's a great spot, the last time I was there I ordered a bread and butter pudding and it was awful. I ate about two bites. It was burned and very cakey, not the moist custardy deliciousness I was expecting.  I'll definitely give it another go because I want to believe that was a once off.",

It has lost its shine a little (in my eyes) in part to do with the other excellent options now nearby - which is not Manna House's fault - but also I am not sure that the patisserie is what it once was.  What remains excellent is the bread, take away rolls and salads.  I would wish the coffee was better - the Edinburgh competition has left it behind - and the lack of toilet facilities makes it less desirable as a place to sit in.  Still, the world, and Easter Road in particular, is a much better place with Manna House in it.",
