Immediately the customer service was absolutely spot on; the lady who took the order was friendly and the delivery was efficient. Even for a busy Friday night delivery was within 25 minutes. Other similarly placed Chinese takeaway/ restaurants were 60 minutes. The food was superb. The Spring rolls were nice, light, and crispy and Sweet and sour chicken was very tasty. The texture of the sweet and sour was well balanced and the chicken perfectly cooked. On this occasion, I thought the dish was comparable to restaurant standard and very reasonably priced.  I shall return to try other favourite dishes.",
