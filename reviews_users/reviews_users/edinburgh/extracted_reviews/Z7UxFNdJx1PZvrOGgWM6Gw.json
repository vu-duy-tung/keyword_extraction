The staff is warm and friendly, the porridge tasted perfectly fresh, and presentation was positively radiant. Thank you, Brochan, for the perfect breakfast experience before we fly home! We will definitely be back! :)",

The oatmeal is delicious and comes with awesome toppings (once I had some vegan brownie topping fresh out of the oven which was amazing). The cakes, cookies and coffee are also lovely. Brochan is a great place to meet up with friends or study--I'm moving and I'm going to miss it!",
