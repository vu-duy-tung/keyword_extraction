    "text": "When my friend told me this place was spectacular, I was skeptical.  See, I'd had the \"good\" Thai place here in Edinburgh, and all the other Asian food I had was exceedingly underwhelming... and then I saw that the dishes were made with, well, extremely local but inauthentic ingredients (lamb dill jiaozi).  But I'll try most anything once and I adore novel food, so I gave it a go.  Seriously these are some of the best dumplings I've ever had. That's not a shallow compliment, either - I grew up in Hawaii, travel a lot, and I've had a lot of Michelin-starred dim sum. Still - these dumplings are in my top three, lifetime.  This place is a treasure. I cannot believe that there isn't a line out the door, constantly. If this was anywhere on the US West Coast or a major metro in China or Taiwan, there would be a line out the door. And it'd be worth the wait.",

The owner was incredibly kind and the food was delicious and so fresh. Disclaimer: the restaurant is rather small and cash only, but if you're looking for authentic Chinese food, this is definitely the place to go!",

    "text": "This is my favourite Chinese eatery in town. I was fortunate to live close by and visited it since its opening day. It was much less busy then and I had interesting conversations with the friendly & hardworking boss about life. That was when I found out about his wealth of experience as a chef and the fact that his famous beef noodle soup is of a secret recipe. The thick & chewy noodles and dumplings are all handmade (with manually operated noodles machines) from scratch, and the beef soup has been boiled for hours on end.   I visited the eatery less frequently after moving away, but the recent change of menu is drawing me back more frequently again. Some of my favourite Chinese dishes such as stewed ribs and mapo tofu are featured and they are absolutely delicious!   Definitely visit this place for a hearty meal at a good value.",

    "text": "I have been coming here since its opening. This is the best Chinese I have had ever! The noodles are delicious and really authentic. I have taken my friends here from China and from Singapore, and they love it as well. This little cozy place gets the Asian seal of approval.   The owner puts on a one man show -waiting, cooking, and running the whole operation. He is really sweet and makes the place feel so homey and inviting.   The menu is great! I personally love the DanDan mein (noodles with peppery sauce) and the zhajiangmian (noodles with soybean sauce). The guo tie (fried dumplings) are also an all time favorite here.   He also as some really traditional dishes like jellyfish and a fungus dish. All in all, they too are delicious. So if you haven't already figured it out, Tasty Noodle is an amazing one man show for everyone to have a glimpse into the street foods of Chinese cuisine and just absolutely tasty food.",

    "text": "Orders: tomato and egg noodle   Fee:  6   Waiting time: 5mins   Taste: the noodle was a little salty. But , this is hand- made noodle, chawing ducilitily, which belongs to north of China. Although, I think chef should put some sugar in tomato and eggs, it still make me full and happy  Atmosphere: As many Chinese noodle restaurant, its decoration is very simple. The pepper oil and vinegar are exactly setting on table like Chinese way.  Backing wills: if I have time, I will go there every weekend.  PS: I love Chinese food.",

    "text": "This place used to be a Korean cafe (Ong Gie) that I enjoyed frequenting until it upped sticks and hopped across to the other side of town. The space lay empty for a while, so I was excited to walk past and see the lights on and the window steamed up again.  First things first, this place is teeny. I make a point of sizing up my restaurants based on how many beds can fit in the room*, and this is definitely no more than 'two double bed' territory. There is a downstairs which was used by previous owners for seating so it may be available for larger groups, but I've never been down there in its latest incarnation. Decor-wise it's back to basics - tables, stools, chop sticks and that's about it.   Homemade noodles and dumplings are the focus of the menu. You can keep a watchful eye on the chef/waiter/owner (it's a one-man show) prepare your meal as the dining area looks straight into the kitchen. He's got skills. I can only aspire to knock up a hot bowl of steaming noodles in the time he does. Before you know it they're on the table. This makes it the perfect spot for a quick pit stop between shows during the Fringe.  Service can be a bit awkward as the owner speaks very little English. If you have any queries about allergies etc you'll likely be out of luck. On my first visit this also resulted in a dish being ordered incorrectly. Luckily this had a happy ending as said dish turned out to be awesome (kelp in a garlic/chilli sauce).   Almost every time I've been in at least 2 or 3 of the other diners been eating, or have ordered the beef noodles. I think these must be developing a following from the local Asian student population, so they've been nudged up to the priority item for my next visit.   My only niggles is that I've now tried to order the whelk dumplings on three occasions, and each time they haven't been available. I have a suspicion it's a case of the menu being in need of an update, but the language barrier stops me from being able to verify.   I'm always on high alert when a venue uses superlatives in their name, but on this occasion it's more than justified - Tasty Noodle it is.  *This is a lie.",
