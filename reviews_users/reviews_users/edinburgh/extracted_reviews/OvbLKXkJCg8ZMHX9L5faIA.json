Sloppy burgers - from a basic cheeseburger through to some monsters (e.g., Lothian Wolf, pulled pork burger).  Grilled Sandwiches and grilled cheese also available.  Yet to try the Poutine.  Fries, various sides, and, oddly, soup.  nice selection of beer - not massively craft but reasonable enough.  Attentive, friendly service.",

For the minimal price difference I would say the poutine is significantly better value. All very very tasty, filling and made freshly to order. We only waited 5 minutes for a table but the queue was huge by the time we left. Very satisfied and would go again. Only trouble is my farts were stinking the next day, a beautiful reminder of a great meal",

    "text": "As a girl from Manchester, that's been spoilt by the \"burger boom\" of the past few years, with many new burger joints constantly popping up, I am now abit of a picky burger consumer. I usually find burgers to not quite hit the mark.  Too dry,  not pink enough, the wrong bun selection, too expensive, rubbish sides, etc etc. This place is so close to perfection it hurts. I opted for the sunshine on beef,and was really very impressed!  It came with lashings of pulled beef ( that I'm usually disappointed by if it's dry). This was moist, flavoursome and all round delicious!  The meat itself was pink (maybe not as pink as I'd like it- nut close enough)  and the bun was soft and soaked all of the fabulous juices up perfectly.   My boyfriend had been before,  so knew that the sides were huge,and so we shared the sweet potato fries that were also delicious.    The only reason I can't give the full five stars is because it is the top end I'd like to pay for burgers, especially when the sides are not included. The service was fine,  but not fantastic, and when I asked for medium rare, apparently they don't go lower than medium.  But if that's the only negatives I have to say on the matter, then I'll certainly be back!   Marie meats almost perfection..",

    "text": "Came for the poutine, stayed for the burgers!  The chips weren't as thin as they usually are in a \"real\" poutine, but the gravy and oh my those cheese curds were just so good!   My fiancee is an even bigger food snob than I am and he loooooved his black and blue burger. I love a burger with good blue cheese and this nailed it. Plus we loved that the caramelised onions really were instead of just grilled for a minute. So flavourful.   It's one of those lengthy menus where we had a really hard time deciding because we wanted one of everything!  Onion rings were ok, but not that great. Burgers are cooked medium but ours were browned all the way through. Still juicy and delicious. But then I'm a person who will order a burger practically still mooing if I can.   The buns were also good quality instead of just an afterthought. Soft but still stood up to the huge burgers.   Good drinks list and service was high quality. Helpful and attentive but let you enjoy the meal. We went on a Tuesday afternoon at 4:30 and it was already getting pretty full. They don't take bookings but it's worth a go. We were surrounded by happy customers devouring delicious looking food so that may have something to do with it. Hmmmm.   Despite the little quibbles I had, it was still a fun and delicious meal. Definitely looking forward to going back and plowing my way through that menu, burger by burger, poutine by poutine!",

    "text": "The opening of Bread Meats Bread on Lothian Road seemed to be preceded by a huge amount of hype due to word of mouth from its Glasgow branch. Much like the new Star Wars film, I was pretty sure it wasn't going to be able to live up to the expectations. But it delivered.  It's was pretty busy for a Tuesday night and there was at 15 minute wait. For somewhere that has just opened I was very impressed at the level and speed of service. Everything was very slick.  Menus that contain puns are great until you actually come to order but 'Sunshine on Beef' is pretty strong so I'll let it pass. The burger itself was delicious. Ordered medium and it was a little bit veering towards well done for my liking but still succulent and juicy.   Also shared a rather large dish of sweet potato poutine amongst my fellow diners. Cheese curds. Gravy. This was intense. It's also not exactly a looker; it's a sloppy, curdy, delicious mess. You probably owe it yourself to have it at least once but not sure I would make a habit it of it. Normal fries were fine but a little dry. Excellent coleslaw though.  Overall this is a very strong start for somewhere that has just opened. I think the similarly named Burger Meats Bun across town just edges this for me but it is close. I'd got out my way to visit for a burger.",

The vegetarian bacon was SO good. Smelled and tasted like real bacon, which I have not found ANYWHERE. I'm so excited I can't even put it in words. They also topped it with sriracha veganaise, which was delicious. The service was the best I've had in Edinburgh as well, and I love the atmosphere and overall vibe.

I arrived at 12:15 and it was queued out the door, actually out the door. As I only wanted a table for 2, I got a seat pretty quickly skipping the large groups and waited for my friend to join me.  The space is pretty small, so I felt like I was dining with the people at the tables on either side of me, and was very conscious of not looking like I was eavesdropping!  My friend arrived and we both ordered a regular burger, nothing fancy. And our food arrived pretty quickly despite how busy the place was. The burgers were fine, nothing to write home about, I've had better and I've had worse.  On our table was a flyer promoting their doughnuts, so after our burgers we decided to order one each. Our waitress went through the flavours and I ordered lemon. What arrived was lemon and cinnamon, a slightly unlikely combination. I'm sad to say the doughnuts didn't look much like the picture on the flyer, and were pretty overcooked, greasy and a bit crispy on the outside.  I don't think I'll be back, there are plenty of other burger places in Edinburgh that I've enjoyed more.",

With so many places offering good burgers in Edinburgh, this place sets itself apart through its unique menu offerings. My wife ordered the single Luther, which is essentially a cheeseburger with a glazed donut as the bun. I have to say that it tasted fantastic, although the logistics of it sometimes required a knife and fork (something I firmly stand against). I had the Lothian Wolf, which was piled high with pulled pork and a runny barbecue sauce. It too tasted great, but the overkill did get to me after a while. As a general rule, I tend to avoid burgers with additional meat that isn't bacon. It reminded me why. We had a side of onion rings and buffalo fries. They were fine, but we struggled to fit them in. Be cautious ordering sides with the burgers so large.  All in all, it was a good experience and we'll probably go again. However, choose your timing carefully if you aren't a fan of waiting. We were lucky to get a seat right away, but there's often a queue out the door during peak times.",

As a Canadian living in this fine city, there are days when I miss Canada's national dish: chips, cheese curds and gravy. But now I can walk over to Bread Meats Bread whenever my poutine-missing heart desires!   I first came across Bread Meats Bread via a Google search for poutine in Edinburgh. No results - so I tried Glasgow. This is its second location. Right on lothian road beside the Filmhouse. You can actually smell the scent of beef on lothian road (and I don't think there's anything wrong with that!). I visited on opening day in the evening and it was busy. The staff were very friendly and welcomed me as soon as I arrived. My partner and I opted for a cheeseburger each and decided to share the poutine. OK - the burgers here are so damn good. I'm going as far as to say the best in Edinburgh (and hey they are well known to be the best in Glasgow!). The server asked how I'd like my burger: med or well done. Medium, obs.  A major plus for BMB is that they serve their burgers and food on plates! Real plates! (I'm so fed up of being served food on a chopping board). The burger was quite big, juicy and had lots of flavour.  The bun is also really tasty - soft enough to hold the burger but not too soft that it falls apart. The poutine is amazing and the cheese curds are real and authentic! They def passed the squeak test! My only gripe with the poutine is that they should use hand cut chips with the skin on them. But that's a personal preference!   Anyway I'm so happy that Bread Meats Bread is finally in Edinburgh. If you are ever really hungover, then I recommend the poutine as your saving grace!",

I absolutely loved it however if you order it, make it a double as a single is quite small; my friends got the falafel burger and it was just huge and looked delicious , definitely something i need to try; i also got the scotalian which is made with mascarpone cheese and in a nice brioche bun; i loved the bun as it is much lighter than normal bun and will not make you feel crazy full when you leave ; for the sides, you have to try their sweet potatoes fries; they are amaziiing and as mentionned by others, one portion is more than enough for too :) the service is very nice and i am looking forward to my next visit",

    "text": "having visited the first Bread Meats Bread in Glasgow i was pretty excited that another branch was being opened in edinburgh!  i mean like really excited because the burgers are just simply amazing.  after a bit of shopping at the running shop next door, the boyfriend suggested we get some late afternoon burger goodness so in we went.  the place is small but smartly done.  i like that you just turn up and if there's a table available they seat you, if not they advise you of a wait time and you wait.  it's a simple system and if you're a die hard for being able to book a table and get it exactly when you want then this may be a bit annoying but it's nice that they don't take bookings and just stick to serving really good food without any frills.  the menu is quite similar to the glasgow branch with a few specific burgers to edinburgh.  i was drawn in by the lamb burger and the boyfriend the wolf of lothian (i think that's what it's called...) and we shared the buffalo fries with hot sauce on the side.  burgers were amazing as usual and my lamb one was super tasty and loaded with tons of feta cheese!  i love that they give you a really good portion of toppings so you can taste it with the burger.  the buffalo fries were really good although i'd always welcome more blue cheese mayo because i mean blue cheese mayo...   best part of the meal was that my total cost was a tenner.  yep, ten pounds for a shared portion of chips and a burger.  the chips are massive so one between two is more than enough.  this place just does things right and i know i'll be back many more times.",

    "text": "I know people rave about this place so I'm sure my review will not be well received. I'm sorry, I didn't have the burgers for which they are so famously amazing. We went for lunch yesterday. Cheerful atmosphere. Very busy. We had to wait for a wee bit which was awkward as there were so many people waiting we were blocking the door. They just don't have a lot of space of there are a few people waiting (maybe 8). But things moved quickly so we didn't mind.  The servers were pretty friendly and we had maybe 4 different servers. So I'm not sure whether they are allocated tables or duties. Leaving a tip...not sure who it goes to!  Firstly my boyfriend had the beef brisket which looked very yummy. He later told me it was dry, which is quite unfortunate. He's not overly picky and isn't one to complain so this says quite a bit.  For myself, a native Canadian I obviously ordered the poutine. My first one in 3 years, a dish that I adore and rave about it to people who have never had it. I was disappointed. The only redeeming factor was the cheese curds. Real cheese curds. That was ace. Other than that I had a a plate of gravy and soggy chips. Too much gravy! It was drowning in gravy. That wouldn't be appetising to anyone. So if someone whose never had poutine before tries it from Bread meats Bread I think they too would probably rate it average and not have it again. It also seems to have been baked, as the chips were baked to the bottom of the dish and my first bite was lukewarm. Underneath was hot so perhaps it had been sitting under the warmer for a while? Hence the super soggy chips?! Either way..:it's an easy dish to throw together it's unnecessary for it to be baked or put under a warmer. The construction of a poutine is simple, chips, pile of cheese curds and hot gravy over top. Not so much that it's drowning in gravy. But enough HOT gravy to melt the cheese curds and puddle amongst the chips. Some chips at the very bottom would eventually get a bit soggy but overall you should have plenty of crispy chips mopping up the gravy. Ah I'm ranting now. I couldn't finish it and mentioned to the waitress clearing out plates that the poutine had too much gravy and she just said she'd tell the chef. Whatever that means.  We also had some onion rings which I cannot rate. They were not to my liking. The coleslaw was nice if not a bit too creamy for my liking. And the medium glass of wine I ordered was very nice but over priced (5!).  All in all I've given the place 3 stars as most people love this place on their experiences of fantastic burgers. I would have given it 2 stars on my experience alone. I'm not sure I would go back.  Sorry lovers of Bread meats Bread....but lovers of poutine will be disappointed.",

By the time I left at 12:35 the place was almost full, so it's popular.  I just ordered the basic cheeseburger and chips. My burger was over cooked so a little dry - good but by no means \"wow\". The chips were also good but again no wow factor for me. I did see some burgers being delivered around me that were so big there was no way it would fit in a mouth.  Service was friendly and fast, which I appreciate. Price was very fair. While the staff were great, the manager looked very distracted. I was the first person to pay at 12:30 and he had to go get the cash till so the wait staff could process my cash payment.  Probably can't go wrong here, so I do recommend. Best burger in Edinburgh? I hope there are better!",

    "text": "Was in the mood for a good burger with some Scottish beef and this place fit the bill.  Visited on a Saturday night around 9 and it was light as they close at 10.  I decided on the Lothian Burger as this is their signature sandwich.  Also, ordered the Poutine.  Turned out the Poutine by itself is a meal!  The burger-there is a lot going on in this sandwich.  Bacon, Pulled Pork, fried onions, cheese, etc.  the Pulled Pork was really tasty but it stole the show and I couldn't taste anything else.  So after taking it out I was left with an excellent burger.  Got creative and ate the pulled pork with some of the Poutine & that was tasty. Speaking of which, the Poutine was as good as what I've had in Montreal.    Must be a local regulation as they can only cook the beef well-done.   As the picture shows, It was a well constructed and presented sandwich.  Service was okay with the restaurant having more of a diner feel to it.",

Though both the burger and poutine included sweet potato fries, they were such different textures (crispy & sweet in the Caribbean and delightfully soaked in the poutine) that I didn't get bored at all. The burger was STACKED so I ended up eating it with a fork and knife, but that made the meal feel even longer so I didn't mind. The poutine was also wonderful - though the cheese curds looked like they were too big at first, they complemented my large bites so all was well.   My mouth is watering as I remember this meal - would recommend!!",

SECOND TIME - pepperoni burger and caramelised sweet potato fries  SERVICE: very friendly employees  CLEANLINESS: place was clean even though there was very busy  TASTE: The first time I went it was amazing, food was great and cooked perfectly. second time i took the food back to my hotel and the food was not that great. this type of food is only good when you eat it as soon as they serve it.   WORTH THE PRICE?:  Burgers are about 8.50 - 10. reasonably priced.  RECOMMENDATIONS: the caramalised sweet potato fries are AMAZING! make sure you eat them while they are warm because they can get soggy and mushy.  WILL I COME BACK?: I am from the States and if I had the opportunity to go back to Scotland, I will be there in a heart beat.

For those complaining about the service, this is typical service in Europe, they don't wait on you hand and foot like they do in the states and you have to ask for whatever you need (including the bill).",

    "text": "I really love Bread Meats Bread. We feel in love with their sweet potato fries with coconut oil and maple syrup at their Glasgow restaurant.  We were really excited when they opened here ! I could eat their sweet potato fries all day!  Because I don't eat beef I haven't gotten to try the majority of the menu but everyone Ive gone with have really enjoyed the beef burgers. I have really enjoyed their chicken sandwiches. I liked the redhead which has bbq chicken and delicious sauces!  All their buns are brioche rolls which makes them DELICIOUS!!!!!! The smell of the place just draws you in and makes you so hungry! Luckily after eating all the tasty food you leave feel very full and satisfied!  They have started to carry fresh donuts as dessert !",
