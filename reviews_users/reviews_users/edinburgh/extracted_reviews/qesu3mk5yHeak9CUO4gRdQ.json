Unfortunately due to ordering at the counter rather than table service, a sizeable queue formed and it took a little while to place our order. However, once we took possession of our goodies, we were more than ok with waiting that extra 10 mins. The coffee was delicious and had a hint of infused liquorice (perhaps?!), a most delightful blend. Our blueberry crumble was also above average, if being critical perhaps a tad heavy...but hey, it was good. We'll be back.",

Having lived in Sydney where cafe culture is rife and coffee-making is considered as serious a procedure as brain surgery, I've often been disappointed by the quality of my coffees since living back in Scotland. Not in this place. Peter's Yard take coffee- making very seriously indeed. And their coffee isn't the only thing to write home about either; this place is also a bakery, selling an array of Swedish baked goods for your eating pleasure.   With clean, slick interiors (think posh IKEA), I'm thinking Peter's Yard is here to stay.",

Although it is quite expensive, the food is of a high quality and the drinks are large and delicious. It reminds me of Harvey Nichols food hall in its layout - upmarket and well presented, with mouth watering pastries and cookies laid out. The premises are very light and airy and would not look out of place in central London. I have as yet only been for drinks and cakes - the hot chocolate is especially good - but colleagues visit regularly for sandwiches to take away for their lunches and speak very highly of the quality.  Well worth a wander off the beaten track to visit.",

They absolutely loved it, and couldn't wait to go back.   You have to try the lemon bread, using mascarpone instead of butter, as it's gorgeous. Also, the fig bread is out of this world.

You reach the place by walking down middle meadow walk for a 100m. At first I thought this was just another coffee shop (starbucks is 10m away), but after going in I learned that this was a swedish bakery. Just what Edinburgh has been crying out for! They sell various breads to go and tell you in loving detail what goes into it. They also sell coffee and healthy snacks to go. In main though I would classify this place as a cafe. It has a eat less but better food and charge you twice as much approach. The food is very nice though. They also seem to sell plates and mugs etc. and are keen to tell you about the furniture company they use.   If you want a spot of indulgent healthyness in an upmarket location with an upmarket price then this is your place.",

I'd advise buying the takeaway filter coffee though because you get a much bigger cup than if you get a normal mug. They have an honesty box where you can help yourself to takeaway coffee and put you money in a pot - this is great because it's much faster than queuing (and great marketing for the company).   All you really need to say after this is CARDAMON BUN. You have to taste them. They market them as their most popular product and they're not wrong - they're absolutely gorgeous. I just wish Peters Yard was on my way to work so I could pick one up every morning.   The prices are similar to Starbucks, but you get much better quality than Starbucks. However, although really nice decor, I don't think Peters Yard is as comfy as Starbucks.",

Great coffee, but for me the main attraction is the wonderful swedish baking they produce and sell here. Their most popular item is the cardamom bun and this is well deserved. They are absolutely delicious. They also sell a range of other swedish buns and cakes which are also very good quality. They have a section with biscuits and other items packaged to take away, and a good range of speciality chocolates.   The cafe space itself is very bright and light with large glass windows and a very scandinavian feel. The atmosphere is relaxed and unhurried. There is also a terrace area at the front, for the better weather.   They are let down by their slightly quirky toilets that can be difficult to open, lock and open again from the inside.   If you can't get to Sweden this is a good substitute.",

So, they opened another Peter's Yard behind the old one (not that old one). It's specifically for Takeaways. Because of this new Peter's Yard takeaway, they've decided that, during lunchtime, you're not allowed to get takeaway coffee from the older Peter's Yard. Which, you know, would be fair enough IF all you were getting was coffee. But, I was getting a takeaway coffee, a chocolate ball and a slice of pizza (I was hungover and was trying to cure myself on my way to work)... The takeaway part didn't have the latter two. So, they decided to make me go out to the other Peter's Yard, get a coffee there, to then come back and get everything else there. Instead of just making me a coffee on the spot. I mean, there wasn't even a queue: it was just a matter of following rules without rhyme or reason. And so, the plummet. I hope they decide to change this new policy, because it is both angering and stupid. I'm off Peter's Yard now. And my pocket is happier this way.",

Until very recently they had some of the most talented baristas in the city and the result was perfectly pulled espresso and some wonderful latte art. Unfortunately several of the baristas have since moved on and the quality of the coffee, whilst still far above average, has dropped.   The food is excellent but expensive and occasionally inconsistent. Apart from the cardamom buns; which are wonderful. Period.   Set on the ground floor of one of the first buildings of the prestigious Quartermile development to be finished, the decor is.. quirky. And from Ikea. Enough said.   All in all, Peter's Yard is a unique high quality addition to the Edinburgh scene that attracts a different crown to the Starbucks literally next door. Superbly conceived and almost perfectly executed it is well worth a visit. Swedish ice cream is surprisingly good too.",

The staff scooped it up with a brush and pan and binned it in the back. I put the bread down and I am never going back. It was rather clear that as the mouse was poisoned, it had been more than one and who knows whereabouts that had been?!",

I've read previous reveiws saying lunch selection is weird  no, it's Swedish. I had a spinach soup there which was excellent. Presentation was lovely and served with two different types of bread. Atmosphere is great, very chilled and lots of spaceanother plus point is the seating outsideif it's a nice day.

The staff are well trained in the art of coffee making and don't rush it or spoil it in any way, temperature and consistency are always excellent, which is great and keeps me coming back and I'm a coffee snob! Lovely cakes (the dark chocolate muffin/brownie cake type thing they do is gorgeous) and the breads look good although I would suggest that maybe they are a little pricey but there is no competition in this immediate area for fresh bread that I know of. It's set in Quartermile, in a lovely large airy space that is comfortable for groups or singles as there is a bench window with bar stools and a range of table sizes. Lunch menu is a bit odd though... as I'm writing this I'm trying to remember what's missing... it's open sandwiches which seem a bit overpriced (though there is a takeaway sibling of Peter's Yard around the back which offers a cheaper take away option), soup, some salads and I'm not really sure what else, it's a queue and order system so you don't really have a chance to look at a menu. However, Peter's Yard is really good coffee and cake experience, I go all the time, and I'll try the lunch someday and see how is is also.",

It is situated just around the corner from the University students playground George Square and is a short walk from the Meadows so it is in an ideal location for students to pop into for a coffee or lunch.   Peter's Yard is a Swedish Bakery/ Cafe/ Coffee house and it serves the most tempting and mouth watering food. Their coffee's are in another league with the other coffee shops in the area and they offer a wide selection of different types and flavours. They open at 7am so it is a great place to stop in for a coffee and breakfast on your way to work as they a selection of breakfast options such as fruit salads, yogurt and granola.   They also serve sandwiches for lunches which you can chose to eat in or takeaway and they are of excellent quality - served on freshly made bread with fresh ingredients - yum! I adore their blueberry pastries which I frequently have as my breakfast, and they are very well priced at about 1.70.   Peter's Yard is more expensive on the whole than the other coffee shops in the area, but the quality of the food and drink is unbeatable. Wi-Fi is now available and there is seating both inside and outside the shop so it is a lovely place to bring your laptop and do some work while sitting outside on a lovely summers day.",

It's almost impossible to find a seat, for one thing, and when you do there's a good chance it'll be on the long table running down the middle of the place. Some people like sitting with random strangers making small-talk over their coffee, on a table that reminds you of the school canteen, but it's personally not my thing.  If you can get one of the other tables, then it's definitely worth the high prices. Their smoked salmon and crayfish open sandwich does cost almost 8 but it is so good you'll soon forget how much you paid for it after your first bite.  If you get sick of all the regular",

Boasting a huge selection of yummy cakes sandwiches and food, this is not your average coffee shop. The prices are a bit high but I have to emphasize that this place boasts quality and you certainly get it. Its tall ceilings and walls made out of windows make it very bright and airy, with its interesting interior, where you can even watch the kitchen make the artisan bread. Also, there is a nice outdoor area for sunny days and smokers. Their food options so far have not disappointed me in the slightest and the service is pretty good too.    The table layout is a bit strange and on busy days, one is squeezed in quite close to strangers. The high ceilings although appealing if they have a live jazz session, increase the noise level. Also, being on a student budget with a taste for quality I do find the prices quite high (it's more like a place to treat myself) In addition, weekends tend to be extremely busy with lots of families and small children so this might not be the place to have a quite read and a coffee at those times. Taking all of this into account, Peter's Yard is a breath of fresh air to your usual over-priced bagel and watery coffee- it offers yummy Swedish treats, artisan breads and spreads as well as good coffee, teas , interesting sandwiches and soup.",

I found their coffee to be quite bitter and didn't like waiting in a 10 min long line. You can see the appeal because of its amazing location and outdoor seating, but it's too expensive for what you are getting. If you are ok with essentially paying for the view and location, then it's a great one! (Ps. Students be aware there is no wifi!)",

I did however manage to have some self control and not buy a dozen loaves to take home! What a brilliant place this is! This displays of bread and treats (that I know I really shouldn't have) literally are breath-taking. There is so much choice!! Something for every taste! I ordered a piece of the parsnip cake, thinking it will be along the lines of carrot cake, a personal fave, and an americano. Although after ordering saw the cinnamon buns and coffee and sour cream loaf. Aaaarrggghhh, too many things, and I wanted them all!!!  Oh boy. That cake was delicious..... with a nice orange cream cheese topping. It was quite a large slab aswell, I nibbled at it for quite a while. Coffee was really really good. So good in fact that I had two! Lovely lovely. I cannot believe it has taken me so long to go here, it is right next to my university building?! The lunch menu sounded lovely, there isn't a massive selection but I don't think it matters, the bread and cake are the stars of the show here!",

This place does it very well. I'd say the disadvantage is the children.  Because it gets rather overrun by them, it felt more like a zoo/playpen than a regular coffeeshop. If you're wanting a quiet read, keep in mind, this is not the place. Now for a good cup of coffee however ....",

    "text": "Peter's Yard is more expensive than most coffee shops, but the quality of the food and drink is far higher than most coffee shops.   Let's start with the bakery - the bread is fantastic and if I'm having a rubbish day, a loaf from Peter's Yard will definitely cheer me up. The cakes and patisserie is also great, with the Valrhona chocolate muffins being a particular favourite. Also try the cardamom buns, the right mix of spicy and sweet to produce a sophisticated treat.   The sandwiches and soups are also excellent, and fairly substantial. They are quite expensive though, and it's easy to rack up a bill of 10 per head on lunch, once you add in drinks and puds. However, if you'd happily spent 6 in Starbucks for a sandwich and a coffee, come to Peter's Yard, spend 8 and enjoy the extra 2 worth of quality. No limp lettuce or burnt coffee here!   The coffee is the real star. It's easily one of the best brews in the city, and often accompanied by truly amazing latte art. It's naturally sweet and smooth and worth every penny.   There's also a good deli section, where you can pick up various crispbreads, biscuits, teas and coffees, as well as a couple of recipe books. It also sells an excellent range of high quality chocolate. If you need some Amedei Chuao, or some single origin Cluizel, Peter's Yard has it.   It's a great place, and my only complaint is that sometimes it's too busy to get a seat!",

Soups are quite good to have for lunch. Their breads are really nice, which I often purchase to eat at home. They have good quality coffee and yummy desserts (my favourite is the parsnip cake, which is very much like the carrot cake).  Now, there are two issues with this place:   (1) It is busy all day and all week long. Consequently, their service can be quite slow. Be prepared to wait in a long queue if you go there during lunch times. Finding a table is not always easy, especially if you are a group of friends/colleagues. It'd be great if they had a larger space.  (2) Prices are definitely not cheap! If your budget is tight, you probably wouldn't wanna go there every day. I wouldn't say the place is expensive, because their food and drinks are high quality, and you're paying for that quality.  Overall, yes I'm a fan, but I wish the place was larger, the service was faster, and the prices were little lower:))",

It bills itself as a Swedish artisan baker selling freshly baked bread, coffees, teas and a good selection of cakes and pastries. The shop/cafe is in a modern building (think glass and steel) and is very bright, airy and Scandinavian. There are a few tables and chairs to sit outside on, which for once, is actually quite a pleasant thing to do as the only traffic going past is skateboarders on their way to Bristo Square. The staff look like they've come to work straight from the set of an American Apparel advert and are uber friendly and helpful. So far, so lovely. Unfortunately all this Scandinavian goodness comes at a price, a Scandinavian price, so it is not a cheap place to stop for a bite to eat - justifiable on the odd occasion, but certainly not everyday.",

    "text": "Yesterday my boyfriend and I came to Peter's Yard for lunch, and then I stayed on to work from here in the afternoon. When we walked in, we were just able to get the last two free seats at a large, shared table in the back. We were there just after 1:30 and they were down to their last few sandwiches and last two servings of soup available for the day. We were a bit surprised at how expensive everything was. 5 for soup of the day is a bit steep, as is 5.50 for a glorified cheese sandwich. My vegetarian sandwich was good, though, and what I liked best was the sunny environment with natural light streaming through the many floor-to-ceiling glass windows on three sides of the cafe. I think what Peter's Yard makes best is everything coming from its top-rate bakery and from its coffee machines.  So I stayed on to work from here after lunch, moving to one of the more comfy chairs (when one opened up) rather than the table where we ate. I was a bit surprised that there was no free wifi (only the BT wifi you have to pay for), which could have been an issue for me other days but luckily I had some editing to do on paper so I was able to sit and enjoy the environment while working, and then check my work emails on my phone. It's not ideal for someone working from home unless you have work you don't need to do relating to anything online, but it works otherwise.  My Tips: 1) If you're coming for lunch, get here early to head-off the lunch rush and get the lunch options while they're still available.  2) If working from here again (which I'm sure I will since I liked the atmosphere and natural lighting so much), I'd probably not come for lunch but, rather, come in the middle of the afternoon for coffee and cake. That is better on the wallet and also on the ability to find a seat. Also, I'd only come to work from here when I know I don't need the Internet!",

    "text": "My knowledge of Sweden is very limited. Off the top of my head, the only things that I think of that are related to Sweden are Ikea, Swedish meatballs, Swedish fish, and Peter Forsberg, and the first two are inextricably linked anyway. So as you can see, I'm not very familiar with Sweden, or any of the other Scandinavian countries for that matter. When I learned of Peter's Yard, a well-regarded Swedish bakery mini-chain that has a location in Edinburgh, the first two questions that popped into my head were 1) what constitutes Swedish baked goods? and 2) would there be any assembly required? I was intrigued enough to pursue this further.  Entering the bakery shortly after it opened, I was immediately greeted by the warm smell of cinnamon swirling in the air. Piles of unfamiliar but most definitely tasty-looking baked goods, ranging from cakes and cookies to assorted breads and buns, were laid out on dishes on the countertop. Proclaimed as one of the bakery's specialties and supposedly a baked good with a cult-like following, the kladdkaka sounded like something I needed to try. Described as a dense, gooey, and sticky chocolate cake, kladdkaka sounded right up my alley. Unfortunately, the slice that I got was dry and crumbly, and I wouldn't be surprised if it was left over from the previous day. For something that was essentially a dry, glorified brownie that cost 2.70, I felt ripped off.  The disappointment from the kladdkaka, though, was remedied by the cinnamon and cardamom buns. I know that Ikea sells cinnamon buns, but the buns baked at Peter's Yard differ substantially from the typical American cinnamon bun. Both the cinnamon and cardamom buns at Peter's Yard consist of a braided mass of soft, slightly sweet dough. The cinnamon bun, topped off with some coarse sugar and almonds, bears no resemblance to the sticky, gooey, and ridiculously sweet (but still delicious) Cinnabons, but it was tasty all the same. I think I actually preferred the cardamom bun, with its slightly fruity flavor making for a more interesting-tasting bun. However, both the cinnamon and cardamom buns were fresh and made for a satisfying breakfast without the hyperglycemia-inducing sugar rush of a Cinnabon.  My first exposure to Swedish baked goods was a pleasant experience. I am definitely interested in trying out some of the other interesting breads and pastries I saw in the bakery, but I can't recall ever seeing a Swedish (or Scandinavian, for that matter) bakery in NYC, though perhaps that's because I haven't looked hard enough. Although I still know virtually nothing about Sweden, at least I will now think of something other than do-it-yourself furniture stores, chewy candies, and brittle hall-of-fame hockey players when I'm talking about Sweden.",

    "text": "Swedish Meat-flaws  ....I have tried this place a few times and it just upsets me every time.   I love Sweden, lots of good things come from Sweden, Ikea rocks my world, Absolut is one of my favourite vodkas, Zlatan Ibrahimovic is a god, Massages and Saunas are also awesome, Tiger of Sweden make great clothes - and let us not forget the Swedish House Mafia!  Peter's Yard is not on my list of good things to come from Sweden  I heard they did great hot chocolate, I went in for one, I thought it was a bit m'eh. I try their cinnamon buns, again average, my housemate bakes better, and their sandwiches just seem to be trying too hard.  Most of the stuff on the shelves is pointless, I wouldn't want to buy any of it - apart from the kiddies coffee cups, they are cool.  I know this sounds harsh, but I get excited about places like this and it hurts when they don't come through with the goods.. I once ran across the meadows from my  flat to buy a couple coffees to go and some coffee beans, they told me to go next door - OK I get it, you have a takeaway place next door how about you go next door and get them for me?   As Jenny says, its overpriced also, and I don't care much for Artisan Flat Bread, thanks but no thanks",

    "text": "Conveniently located, yes, but in regards to quality - not so sure!  On a sunny afternoon we walked down Middle Meadow Walk towards the Meadows and decided to stop over for a coffee break at Peter's Yard. I heard many good things about this place and thought to try it out.  We were able to grab a table in the sun, well, half in the sun and  the other half in the shadow. In the end the shadow overtook the sun and we started freezing. This was the point in time when we decided to move inside for some comfort. I like the outside area. Its very spacious. I also like the inside interior with with the heavy wood tables and chairs, a counter holding a variety of cakes and breads (of which I bought one), not to mention the funky take away cups. You are not able to choose between small, medium or large cups. No, You can only choose one size and the options are 1. Take away  2.cup (inside). The personnel was extremely polite and they even offered table service, outside and inside.  So, why only 3 stars? That's really hard to explain, as everything seemed so perfect. Yes we waited for the coffee for up to 10-15 min, but this shall not be the main reason for the lower than planned rating. What is it then? Oh yes, I remember. The warm drinks did not have the right kick. For myself, I had ordered a Latte Macchiato and a banana cake. Personally I thought that the coffee and the cake were not up to the standard I would expect of such a popular place. Of course, it could be me, being so fuzzy when it comes to coffee and desserts. The cake appeared a bit dry. Its a shame, as it looked really tasty. What's the saying?  Its not you, its me! :-)  I also saw lots of other food options, like salmon on bread, salads and other nice\" tasties\" (good looking food), and next time when going there, I will try something else. Maybe it will improve the rating.  Still, I think that this place is an ideal stop on the way towards or from the Meadows.",

Decided to stop in after a day that required much needed caffeine. I noticed that there were people ordering their pizza. It looked amazing so the next day, I came back with two friends and we ordered two pies to share. It was so delicious! I've been living in a country where good pizza is hard to find and missed NY-style pizza. I was definitely happy to be digging into this pizza. I even came back to get a pie the last few days of my three week stint during the festival. Get the Parma ham pizza, you won't be disappointed.  I also had the chocolate coconut ball but it was ridiculously tough to bite into so I wouldn't recommend it. Stick to coffee, tea, pizza, and the sandwiches (I thought they looked good)",

PRO - The food is delicious and filling and YUM YUM YUM. Breakfasts are really good.  CON - It is admittedly also quite expensive. This is ok sometimes but occasionally I felt a little short changed.   PRO - It's an amazing building that feels airy, bright, sunny, magic and warm CON - Because of this it's REALLY busy sometimes and can be hard to find a seat as already mentioned. They also have NO WIFI (sin)  PRO - They do really good pots of tea that are excellent value for money and do do takeaway coffee CON - They took away the honesty box for takeaway coffee because tramps kept stealing it - This means you have to queue for it and that takes ages - defeating the point of it being a \"quick\" option.  PRO - It's independently owned and I love it because they are doing something different and interesting and creating a strong brand. CON - I find it really hard to find nice fitting trousers in most high street shops now a days. usually no bum/legs are too tight. WHAT SHAPE ARE MOST MEN NOW FFS?  PRO - The outdoors bit is really good. Lots of space - good sun in the morning. CON - I hate that there are cash machines in some places that charge you to use them. It really really annoys me. The ONLY one at Aberdeen Central Station charges you 1.50 - can you believe that?  PRO - It's a lovely place to sit and read a book/tether your laptop to your phone and work. CON - I imagine it wouldn't be a great place to be in an earthquake.  So overall. Amazing stuff. I recommend checking it out and eating crispbread and cheers MMMMMMmmmmmmmMMMMMMMMM",

Sunshine in a pot whether the sun is really out or not. They have a few sorbets & lots of interesting ice cream flavours that I'd love to try (damn you lactose intolerance).

You have many choices of bakery things everyday in Peters Yard. By the way, must have a glance of their chocolate shelf, which have plenty of flavored chocolates, even lavender chocolate. Guess they must be great. Anyway, it is a valuable place around the george square.",

    "text": "Being a member of the Edinburgh University Scandinavian Society, this Swedish cafe has been the venue for a couple of our events, and it's definitely appropriate, even down to it's decor of minimalist scandinavian design.  I lived in Sweden for two years, so was increasingly surprised as I spotted one swedish speciality after another on the menu and at the counter! It's primarily a bakery, so all the delicious pastries and desserts I'd only found in Sweden were here, and in abundance as well; cinnamon buns and all sorts of muffins! They also sell a selection of sandwiches, and for those homesick Swedes, hand made crisp bread and jams imported from the land of the Vikings!  On the occasions I've been there for society get-togethers, there have been free for all waffles, served with ice cream, jam and cream... extremely messy but equally satisfying! And ofcourse a Swedish cafe wouldn't be complete without an endless supply of coffee; seeing as I'm not particularly a fan, I'll give it a pass and say I've definitely had worse.   Peter's yard is just off George Square, so a student favourite, and with outdoor seating, it's a glorious place to be when the Scottish weather decides to be generous!",

Perfect for sunny afternoons in the Meadows is the hidden gem round the back, their takeaway place, sadly only open till 6pm. The ice cream here is amazing, great flavours and they got them spot on. Favourite of mines are Cardamon, Coconut and Pistachio. Pistachio was my favourite ice cream as a kid and but once I had their pistachio it was something else. They've perfected the flavour. Please let me know if you can find better ice cream anywhere around.",

I love the long table in the middle, which acts as a community table, or a more private side on the other side of the shelves.  And with huge glass windows, perfect for people watching or just enjoying being dry as it rains outside.  While Peter's Yard is a bit on the pricey side, their justification is the hand-made quality, which combined with the proximity to the University of Edinburgh central campus, explains why students often indulge here.  Wide selection of unique foods, that are piled high and make you feel as if you're eating something healthy (and trendy too).  I'm always impressed by their Cardamon buns, and their cheese scones are very delicious too.  Decent hot chocolate.  All in all Peter's Yard is a step above your standard cafe, but for me its the atmosphere that is the main draw.  Beautiful interior, good food, and very friendly staff.",

But then the scones I know aren't packed with goat's cheese, courgette and parsnip, or pear, rhubarb and white chocolate either, so I'll forgive the squareness of the Peter's Yard ones.  Peter's Yard is a lovely, bright venue with huge windows, lots of tables outside if it's warm enough, and an array of sandwiches and cakes that all look gorgeous, in a square-scone sort of way. I mean, what's the point of an open sandwich? How do you eat it? Especially one with slices of potato on... it melts my mind a wee bit, but I'm determined to go back and give it a try!  It does take a while to get served, as everything's ordered at the counter, but that does give you plenty of time to stare at all the goodies on offer and make a decision. Next time, I'll brave the sandwiches, and report back on how I manage to eat mine.",

    "text": "I reached Peter's Yard in a state of anticipation. Yelpers had been raving about this place, the sun was shinning and the Ray Bans were on. The only clouds anticipated were the possibility of no GF products.  I went in to grab cake. 1. its a staple food and 2. I wasn't sure when I'd eat if the work meeting hadn't catered for my special needs. The open sandwiches look amazing - sure I can't eat the bread but they are substantial enough to be a decent salad minus it. Fresh bread and cakes are on offer. No GF bread but there is GF cake and a decent choice. Luckily I love nuts (might be an issue for non-nut eating GF's) as many options were of the nutty variety - Pecan Pie, chocolate covered meringues with nuts, pastachio horse shoes and another option which escapes me. For a place which appears to be evil (non-GF) heaven, I was pretty damn pleased that I had a selection to uhm and ahhh over, till I made up my mind.   I went for the Pecan Pie. Now I know there have been a few comments about prices, etc but this pie was pretty damn great and a pretty damn good portion - I've had cake in town which has been a 3rd of this size and more expensive. It was yummy (also Vegan friendly) with lots of pecan's and a lovely sweet base with almonds to give it a bit of bite - just moist enough to be moreish but not to disintegrate.   This cake also passed the bag test - see what goes in Claire's bag and comes out intact - which is a major accomplishment. It travelled all over Edinburgh and beyond, in its little Peter's Yard box and stayed intact - that's impressive - to be finally consumed around midnight, a good 14 hours after it was purchased. Although the box wasn't airtight (it may have taken a bit of punishment between the folders and IT equipment), there was no difference in its taste (nibbled at throughout the day as work did provide a GF lunch) and it hadn't started to go hard or stale.   Peter's Yard I salute you! The provision of freshly baked GF bread (or the holy grail of GF Carrot cake) will get you am instant 5 stars, but you might get an upgrade on my next visit as I'm sure we'll be seeing each other lots.",

So I have to trip through to Edinburgh to get my fix of Swedish bakery goodness.  Now we're not talking about the wee shoppe at the end of ikea here.  This is the real deal.  I've got distant Scandinavian family and so have long had a love of swedish crisp breads, and the last time I had ones as good as the ones you can get here was when we had then from Sweden itself.    This place isn't cheap - but it's perfect for a treat.  I brought the parental types here when they came to stay and my Mother was over the moon reminiscing about the old family holidays abroad.  Now it's also worth mentioning that my Mutti navigates the country by where she can get her next caffeine fix (yes really) so the coffee here gets a big thumbs up.  Which is to be expected when they are serving up Artisan Roast stuff, done properly.  Huzzah.  My top tip?  Splash out and get a loaf of bread to take home, or even just a cardamom bun.  For me they are the smell of Scandinavia; every coffee shop I went into in Finland served these traditional treats.  Serve with strong coffee on an Ikea table with stupid name (table optional)",

The location makes it really convenient for me so I stop in sometimes to grab a roll or something quick for breakfast and it is always crowded. So, clearly there is a customer base for it, it's just amazing to a student who has learned how far a pound can go.

    "text": "I have visited Peter's Yard a couple of times now with a friend and have enjoyed my experience. They serve nice strong loose tea, which is always a plus in my book. And my friends love the coffee. The pastries, cakes and sandwiches look amazing, and I'm looking forward to trying that soon... due to having been here at odd hours between meals, it just hasn't happened yet... but I do end up staring at the food on the counter, if I have to admit it.   If you visit on a cold day, then it's worth ordering a very warm drink. There is a bit of a draft through the whole place. This is due to a faulty door, which they have made a sign for. It really might be worth fixing that.   I want to give the Yard at least 4 stars, but I'm just not there yet. This is a pity as it has the food and look and feel of a place that should be getting 5 stars. This is partly to do with the fact that both times I've visited I haven't had much interaction with the staff. It actually seems a bit like responsibilities in the kitchen seem to have priority over managing the till and the customers. I still think the place could easily earn a higher rating from most recent reviewers, but maybe they have become too confident in the quality of their food to the detriment of the little things.",

Could not even taste the espresso in the coffee (but the foam design was cute) and the cardamom bun could have been so much more flavorful! It was so slight. The cafe itself is huge and very well designed!  Lots of variety in sweets and beverages.",

I think its a nice cozy cafe, and even provides blankets if you are cold and sitting outside .  the savoury food looks amazing but I haven't had the chance to try it yet, hope to next time.",

The coffee is good, the tea selection from Anteaques is wonderful (try the grapefruit black tea), and the pastries/ cakes - delightful. Peter's Yard does a great job of blending together unique and interesting flavours. The foods are tasteful, appropriately seasoned (e.g. just enough sugar to highlight the flavours of their desserts), and very Instagram-able.   Recommendations: Sunday morning Swedish pancakes, Grapefruit Black Tea, the Raspberry Ice Cream, and the Vanilla Cardamom Bun.",

The vanilla roll was like a bagel donut with vanilla tapioca pudding in it, rolled in sugar.  Tried the hot chocolate - perfect temperature, good chocolate/ milk balance, and sinful.  My latte was a bit bitter, which was the only downside, but corrected with some table-side pure cane sugar.  The pink rock candy citrus shortbread was buttery and soft, but not too flaky.  Self-serve tap water available (a plus for any runners like me who drink a lot of it).    Love the blankets available to use for outdoor seating, and staff was friendly and willing to answer my questions about ingredients.  Great location, and way better than Starbucks next door for the same price.",

It's a flat white folks - not rocket science. And after a dozen of them, you can quickly gauge whether this is \"just ok\" coffee or a good cup. Peter's Yard makes a good cup.  This place is great for a business meeting. It's ALWAYS busy but somehow, doesn't seem to ever be too loud to concentrate or hold a conversation and the folks behind the counter are friendly as heck. I'm not sure it would ever become a working cafe because of how many folks it packs in on a daily basis, but it will definitely stay as a go-to spot to mesh minds over a flat white... or two... or three.",

What they don't tell you though is that around the corner one can buy the same soup and delicious homemade bread for 3.80.   Peter's Yard To Go offers the same top quality as its more expensive big brother around the corner...What are the disadvantages? There are fewer places to sit and... Okay, just that. You can still find your favourite cardamom buns, sandwiches (also much cheaper), good coffee and lively salads. There is something here which cannot be bought at the original shop: ice cream! Elderflower gelato anyone?  This has become my healthy lunch to go. For 3.80 I get a bowl of warming soup and a couple of slices of delicious homemade bread. If I want to hang out somewhere for a longer time I would go next door where there is a couch and not too much pressure to get up and leave due to high demand for seats. If I want a quick and tasty lunch, I shall come here.",
