I love the decor from the random barber chairs to the bicycles and the other furniture.  The food really makes me feel at home, but with a Scottish appeal on some dishes. You've got your pizza, burgers, nachos, hotdogs, and wings WITH ranch. I have yet to find a decent wing spot until this place and then to find out they do it right with ranch? Oh baby...  The drinks are great too. They've got a nice selection of cocktails which are all creative and innovative all on their own. They know what they're doing. They serve up my old fashioned the proper way.   The music they have going on is perfect, although it's a distraction from getting any work done there (they have free wifi), it's the best kind of distraction.  Needless to say, I'll be a regular.",

Everything was well done and the service was very fast. The burger was incredible, it's been a long time since I tasted such delicious food. I think I'll visit it again, since there are not much good places like that. Thank you!",

    "text": "So 11 months later I figured I'd give Whistle Stop another try as it's been open for a while. I shouldn't have bothered.   The reason we picked here was that they do a 'express lunch' menu as we only had an hour until we needed to be back at work and if it's not served within 15 minutes of being ordered it's free so we assumed that it'd be quick. The menu includes burgers, pizzas, sandwiches and salads all for 5.95. All sounds good. However I can't tell you how it tasted as we had to leave to go buy food before heading back to work 40 minutes after we'd ordered.    After 25 minutes of waiting we managed to get hold of a waiter who apologized, told us we wouldn't be charged for our food and that it'd be out shortly. 10 minutes later as the food still hadn't arrived we tried to pay for our drinks. It took 5 minutes for the person on the bar to establish that we hadn't got our food and as such we weren't paying for it, her to go talk to someone else and then come back and say that we didn't need to pay for our drinks, all without her managing to apologize. So by the time we left it was 40 minutes after we ordered our 'express lunch' with no sign of it and other than a 'sorry, I'm not sure what's happened it's not normally like this' from the waiter who then disappeared, no real apology or attempt to make amends.   This was on a random Tuesday with 3 other tables occupied so I wouldn't like to try this place is they were actually busy.",

    "text": "Stopped in here yesterday for a bite to eat for lunch, as I had been meaning to since I heard there was an American place opening up in Edinburgh. As an American, I love hot dogs and American food so I'm glad I finally got the chance to try The Whistle Stop. My boyfriend and I came in late for lunch and it was pretty quiet, but I was impressed by the atmosphere of the place, it seemed like a cool place to catch a drink and hang out with friends after work or at lunch time. There are a few really big booths there so it is good for groups of people!  We ordered the fried tomatoes, fried chicken bits, Philly cheesesteak egg roll, and a hot dog. I keep ordering fried tomatoes wherever I go in Edinburgh and not getting what I expect...and these weren't amazing either. Too soggy. Oh well. All of the other food was really good. The best thing was the Philly cheesesteak egg roll, which I actually thought would be weird. I would absolutely order that again! Fried chicken was quite nice and the hot dog was pretty close to a standard American hot dog that I know and love!  I will definitely update this review once I try their cocktails, as I saw the bartender making some and they looked quite amazing and delicious.",

    "text": "If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Sygn should consider itself well and truly flattered. From the menu (both the selection of food and the design of the menu itself), to the regular daily deal promotions (well priced burger/pizza with cocktail), Sygn's influence is stamped all over Whistle Stop.   I'm torn between trying to guess whether this is another venture from the Sygn team (I don't believe it is), a close friend who has been given the owners blessing to emulate them, or a brazen competitor with little sense of subtlety. Answers on a post card! Not that all this is really bad thing. Sygn is a favourite of mine, so I'm happy to see anywhere pop up that aspires to offer a similar level of quality.   So how did it fare?  Service was relaxed and friendly. The burger patties were made up of a good blend, providing a good meaty flavour to them. These were served on airy brioche buns, rather than the over-sized floury baps that bars often serve burgers in. The burger dressing was a bit sparse, leaving the bun a tiny bit dry, but was quickly rectified using the condiments on the table. Overall, not a bad burger and a lot better than most local bars would serve up. The pizza was to a similar standard with a nice crisp, thin base and interesting toppings (pulled brisket for me). If you're like me and like plenty of cheese on your pizza, you'll be well served here though there may be an element of quantity over quality as it did taste of the slightly over-processed variety. A better cheese blend and they would be top notch.  Whilst not quite at the same standard as its spiritual role model just yet, there's already a lot to like about Whistle Stop. Time should only refine this, and enable it to solidify it's own identity. Some of the more unique items on the menu (egg benedict pizza, philly steak egg roll, pulled brisket pizza) already nods toward this.  One worth keeping an eye on.",

However, a couple of booths had been reserved for us, and we weren't neglected by the staff who swung by reasonably frequently to take orders for drinks as well as food.  I only had a wee order of chicken wings but they were perfectly tasty & hot and not bad for only 3.50.  I discovered an elderflower & gin cocktail on the promos menu and that was me set for the night. 3.95 for an elegant looking short drink, floral and with a hint of cherry from the maraschino liquor - super tasty! I'd go back just for these.  There's apparently a live DJ on Friday nights, and we were enjoying the tunes - we were all boogying away in our booth to the classics anyway! Must point out how super hospitable the staff were - friend brought birthday cake and they brought it out with added candles and all the necessary plates, knives and forks!",

    "text": "This place is the new imagining of the Rascals burger joint (no idea if it the same people behind it or not) and is another restaurant aiming at the 'all american' burger bar. I had read some good reviews for this place and so I had high hopes.  On first impressions I liked this place the decor was much improved from when it was Rascals.    The greeting was friendly and we were quickly seated and given a menu which had a good selection of both food and drink. Within 5 minutes our drink our was taken and within a reasonable time they were delivered and by delivered I mean dropped at the table without a word and then the waitress vanished before we could order our food.  It then took another 15 minutes for someone to come and take our food order - the delay, we were told, was because a large pre-booked party came in and they had to be taken care of first. I always hate it when restaurants use that as an excuse, it's always such a cop out.  The food was slow to come out but it was well presented, however I was a little underwhelmed as I was expecting more going by the price.  For a start the orders were slightly wrong which sows a poor attention to detail - I had asked for no burger sauce and it had burger sauce on it, we both asked for well done and they came out pink and a little on the cool side like they had been standing for a while and then they forgot one of the sides.  We tried to get the attention of the waiting staff to rectify the mistake but they were all too busy to notice so we just went ahead and ate as we were hungry and didn't want to have to wait longer.  On the whole the food tasted nice enough but felt a little lacking compared to other burgers you can get in the city.  The burger itself was not very well seasoned and was a little bland, and the bread was a little on the stale side which is always disappointing.  I would say however that the boston beans and burnt ends were tasty.  Once finished we asked for the bill, mentioned the problems we experienced to which we got a 'Sorry, you should have said something' to which I explained that it is hard to say something when the staff are not paying attention and are preoccupied with other people.  Some of the other reviews rave about this place and maybe we went on a bad day, but from this experience I wouldn't want to risk spending more money to get a repeat.",
