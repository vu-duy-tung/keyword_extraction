I had the salmon- it was excellent. Perfectly cooked. Chili tomato salsa was great. My son loved his burger.  Nice setting too. Cool tables. Great service. Would definitely recommend. Hopefully be back next time I'm in Edinburgh.",

    "text": "For a friendly nicer Scottish restaurant with reliable food and no surprises, Pibroch is a good choice. My flat is about 100 meters away, so it's a bit surprising I waited 8 months to try it, but in my defense, it always seemed like a slightly nicer sort of place so I wanted an occasion to go. Finally, for a dinner with my girlfriend, I made a reservation and went in to try.   First impression was that it was a very easygoing nice restaurant - although they were serving finer food at finer prices, the wait staff was friendly and not too formal. Food was typical Scottish faire - classics like cullen skink, haggis, neeps and tatties, the like. There are even a few veggie options, such as a veggie pie or non-meat haggis (which is worth a try if you haven't before). I had lamb rump with potatoes and was happily satisfied with it. They also have a few beers and ciders to accompany the meal. Wine, too, but I don't know if that goes as well with hearty Scottish food to be honest.   We also had dessert, a salted caramel ice cream with ginger date cake. Again it fit the bill, tasty while being neither under or over whelming. Overall, Pibroch is a good place, homier than expected, good for tourists or locals alike who are looking for a nice, reliable meal of Scottish staples without breaking the bank or pursuing some nouveau modernist fusion version on what at the end of the day is simple filling food.",

    "text": "I told myself I wasn't going to try the haggis, but what did I do? I tried the haggis. I'm glad I did. The wait staff there are extremely attentive, friendly, and willing to answer any questions.   Our party started off with the haggis parcels in a red wine plum sauce as an appetizer. The haggis was encased in filo dough. It was delicious.   I went with the salmon, because Scotland has the best salmon in the world, so I've been told. This salmon was exceptional. I enjoyed the crispiness on the top of the salmon and the potatoes and broccoli accompanied the dish perfectly. I didn't care for the tomato sauce, and just ate around that.   If you want authentic Scottish food, and friendly service, try this place out.  They are also wheelchair accessible, as they have a ramp to guide you in the door.",

    "text": "This was our best meal in Edinburgh.  I loved the atmosphere, service and food.  I had the cullen skink which is smoked haddock chowder.  It was excellent, better than at another place where I tried it.  I also had beef dripping chips (beef fat fries).  It's no surprise that they were delicious.  I also had roasted vegetables.  They were a bit uninspired and I would recommend not bothering with them.  The chocolate cheesecake was divine.  Highly recommend Pibroch Scottish!",

Really recommend the haggis parcel starter. The lamb rump and steak fillet were both very tender and excellently cooked. The red cabbage side complemented the lamb rump nicely. The beef and ale pie was quite bland and so-so, but that wasn't enough to take a star away from them. Service was very good; they were patient and friendly without being overbearing. Cute decor as well. I really enjoyed my time here!",

    "text": "Sorry guys, a bit overrated. The cullen skink was a bit watery, the beef ale pie was a bit  land. Customer service : outstanding. I really wanted to love this place especially since reviews were ranting and raving !  The beef ale pie was a hit and miss, the stew was a bit bland, the pastry on top was flakey and crispy; I did the care much for the thick cut fries (beef sized chips). The cullen skink which is smoked Pollock with leek and potato soup , was too watery.  I happen to stop by another place that made pretty good pies ..but this didn't happen to be a good representation of good Scottish food.",

    "text": "My husband and I popped in for lunch this afternoon. We didn't know what to expect as we hadn't heard of Pibroch before but with the snow coming down, we we're eager to find somewhere quickly.  I'm so glad we did! I had the cullen skink and beef drippings chips, my husband had the fish and chips. He said the better was delicious and fish cooked perfectly. As for my soup, the flavour and consistency were ideal for a cullen skink. Not super thick, but very liquidity - just right. And with no shortage of fish and potatoes, I might add.  Great cold beer! And the best - STICKY GINGER AND DATE PUDDING, GINGER BISCUIT CRUMBLE AND SALT CARAMEL ICE CREAM!!!! I don't even have a picture because we devoured it so quickly!   The icing on the cake though was the service. Our waitress/hostess was so sweet and informative. She even (with the help of the cook) gave us recommendations for other local finds.   Overall, it was an excellent experience and I'm glad the snow took us inside. We'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "I really want to like this place but the service and the food were so poor that it simply isn't possible! I booked a reservation online but they weren't ready for us when we arrived on a quiet Friday night at 8:30. We were seated and then waited for 10 minutes before someone came to take a drink order. My husband never received his drink - only a soda water. All I wanted was plain water and then had to wait 10 more minutes before this arrived. We ordered our meal and then waited over 45 minutes. Two other parties that came after us were served before us and finished eating while we waited... When we asked about our food we were told 10 minutes later that there was a mix up and they never put our order through. Finally, we got our food after more than an hour of waiting. The kids meals were tiny. My son was so disappointed in his fish and chips (honestly how can any establishment in Scotland mess that up!?!), that I had to take him around the corner to another shop for more food after our dinner. My food was actually quite tasty (an eggplant and goat cheese tart) and the presentation was lovely. But I was so hungry that I ate it in 5 minutes. To compensate us for the delay, they took one of the children's meals off our bill (not enough of an apology in my opinion) but still charged us for the drink we never received. So, unless they can really up their service game, I simply cannot recommend this place. It's too bad as it's quite a cute little spot and I'm sure it's a small family run place. I would have given zero stars but for my dish and the ambience. I hope they can improve and survive...",
