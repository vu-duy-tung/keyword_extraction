The Kung Po came with a variety of fresh vegetables with real tasty bits of chicken and cashew nuts. The white rice was perfectly cook and was not sticky at all. I would definitely come back here again!",

We ordered the Chicken Chow Mein, Chicken and Shrimp Fried Rice, Spicy Chicken Wings and Sweet and Sour Chicken. The fried rice was very bland and the shrimp tasted funny. The chicken wings were fine. The sweet and sour chicken however, we did not enjoy at all. The sauce, we all agreed, tasted way too sweet and had a odd flavor to it I just can't describe. The batter was coming off the chicken and it was very chewy. I wouldn't say this is authentic Chinese food because it certainly did not taste like it, and my background is Chinese. However, this is my own opinion, and maybe the chef just had an off day? But that doesn't account for the freshness of the ingredients as clearly it was lacking. Delivery came pretty fast though.",

    "text": "Better than average Chinese restaurant in Edinburgh.  The Scottish capital, and this may not be a surprise, is not exactly the British capital of great Chinese food. None of the Chinese places in the city even compares to something like the Red Chilli chain in Leeds, Manchester, or (especially) York. But when you're in Edinburgh and have a craving for things Asian, you can do worse than at The Rendezvous Restaurant.   The Rendezvous is a little to the south of the old town. From the Sir Walter Scott Monument e.g., it is either a short bus/tram ride or a 25 minute walk (down one street, basically). I had dinner there after a visit to the CAMRA Scottish Real Ale Festival in July of 2014. Drinks-wise, like most Chinese places, The Rendezvous is a diaspora. Think some soft drinks and a couple of fizzy lagers, or overpriced, mediocre wines. But then, you don't go to a Chinese restaurant for the drinks.  I had two mains and a starter: a (supposedly) spicy meat and vegetables soup, squid with mixed vegetables, and beef with mixed vegetables. All of these had one thing in common: A bit more spice would not have hurt. It was all pretty bland, but obviously freshly prepared and perfectly edible. Just a tad too dumbed down for British and European sissies.  The decor is rather elegant, i.e. for a Chinese restaurant. It is essentially one big room. It was rather empty when I visited, but that was an early dinner. Service was okay. After all, this is a Chinese place, so you don't expect service flourishes.",

    "text": "After the sad demise of Wok and Wine, we've been looking for another Chinese restaurant that's gluten free.  I am happy to report that we may have found it!  Rendezvous is on Queensferry Street just two doors down from Wannaburger.  Follow the red staircase up one flight and, as one other reviewer says, don't let that put you off.  We booked through OpenTable and when we arrived a couple of hours later our reservation was in their book with the notes we always include about \"one of the party being coeliac\".  They checked with us straight away and said to ask about any dishes as they'd be able to advise.  Now, often people say that and don't quite get it but they were able to answer all my queries (of which there were many).    One lovely touch was to bring out, with the menus, a bottle of Tamari Sauce instead of soy, so I was really pleased about that.  We had deep fried paper-wrapped prawn as a starter which was stuffed full of prawns and piping hot (although there was a bit too much grease when you bit into it).  We also had a fried shredded chicken.  I can't remember what it was called but it was lovely - again really hot and full of garlic and chilli.  Nice and 'dry' too rather than oily.  For main I had Quick Fried Lamb with Spring Onion - lovely and fresh and not too glutinous.  Husband had Duck with Black Bean Sauce which was a bit too gloopy for me, but lots of big chunks of duck.  We ordered just one fried rice, which was plenty for two of us.  We consumed endless rounds of Jasmine Tea, and the total bill was only 37.  What a bargain!  It was a Sunday night and it got increasingly busy (we were there at 7pm).  Always a good sign is also the amount of Chinese people that dine in, and this didn't disappoint.  All the staff were really friendly and made the effort to suggest alternatives if what I wanted wasn't totally GF.  They were also able to say that the chef could make a variation, to make it GF, which is always a nice touch.  It just makes for a better experience as you know that they aren't just talking the talk.  The space itself is good with plenty of room between the tables - not cramped at all .  It's a large area.  The floor is clean, tables, chairs and curtains appear new and the overall decor is pleasing and modern.  Again it doesn't look tired.  Husband has eaten here once a few years ago at the buffet lunch.  He didn't remember it as being spectacular, but I'd go back to this place again for the a la carte.  Wine looked to be very good value, with a choice of four whites or reds at under 16 a bottle.  There were quite a few cocktails being ordered by other diners, so they know how to do more than just pour a pint, clearly.  Finally, they are promising to publish a separate GF menu and they said they'd be working towards making some more things GF.  I'd coveted the chicken wings on the next table and the waitress suggested that in a few months they'd have a GF version.  It's certainly going to get us to go back!  So, have we found a replacement for W&W?  I'd like to think so.  It's been in business since 1956 so it must be doing something right.",

Once we had entered the place I had a rough idea what to expect after being to a similar restaurant in London, the staff upon entering were polite but said rather little, seemed more accustomed to pointing.  The menu was extremely varied (took a while to decided what I wanted). The portion sizes were a lot bigger than expected (not a bad thing in the slightest!)  It was very quiet in the restaurant but it was a nice relaxed atmosphere.   Now the main part of this review is the price! Both my girlfriend and I very extremely surprised at the price. Having both been to Chinese restaurants of similar calibre we knew how much money we were looking to shell out (50+) But here however for 2 courses (soup and a main meal each) plus a drink each only came to under 35  We genuinely thought he waitress forgot to add something on the receipt   All in all I found this place wonderful! And would certainly go back again next time I'm in edinburgh",

The duck had a little too much fat on it that should have been cooked off. I did not expect to find such a gem in Edinburgh. Will definitely return for Chinese food when I visit Edinburgh again.",

The restaurant specialises in Cantonese and Peking cuisine, and there's sooooo much choice on the menu it's difficult to decide what to have. Like many chinese restaurants, the desserts menu isn't elaborate and there is something with banana's in it; this seems to be a constant in just about any chinese restaurant I've been to!   One great sign in this restaurant is that there are actual Chinese people frequently eating there, as we all know its most difficult to please the home crowd.",

The take away options are much fresher and at 4-5 for main dish I really like this option too, the sizes are decent as well.  The first 2-3 times I went in I found the staff to be a bit grumpy, and the decor a bit old, but the good food kept me coming back, especially for take away. The last time I went in though all the staff were really friendly which was nice, hopefully the customer care is on the up.",

Not as huge a display of food as, say, China China or Jimmy Chung's but there's not the same feeling of desperation to get as much on your plate. It's all a bit more civilised at Edinburgh Rendesvous and there's still lots of choice. If you're not up for a culinary Supermarket Sweep experience, this is definitely the place to go for a Chinese buffet. Only one tiny little fly in the ointment (hence the 4 stars and not 5) was that the staff all seemed a little glum. Don't know why as business is obviously booming because the place was packed out by 12.30 but that was the only thing I could find fault with.",
