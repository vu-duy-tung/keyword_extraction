    "text": "This cafe serves those staying in The Fountain Court Apartments, but anyone can pop in for a breakfast.  Breakfasts are their specialty with most things you can think of on the menu. My personal favourite is tattie scones with black pudding and apple compote. It's absolutely delicious!  This place wins for its sense of humor. With Flaming Lips posters on the wall, an 'employee of the month plaque', a host of humorous books and general good humor and banter from the staff, they've turned what could be a canteenish place attached to holiday apartments into a cosy spot.   Top tip: You can always spot this place at night as they tend to leave the toilet door open, facing the street, with the light on...I don't know why...",

    "text": "Great little cafe at the base of the castle in a park, next to... you guessed it, a fountain! We walked by and decided to visit for coffee and donut. Inside the cafe was all sort of options for food from hotdogs to baked goods, and I happily munched my donut outside in the picnic table area. Pretty neat place.",

This is a pretty nice place to sit with a friend for a conversation over a burrito/enchilada/sandwiches on paninis or toasties/shortbreads/pastries.  I love the soups there. And had it every day when I was in Edinburgh with some veggie paninis. Lovely staff too.   It has rock theme posters all around the place.",
