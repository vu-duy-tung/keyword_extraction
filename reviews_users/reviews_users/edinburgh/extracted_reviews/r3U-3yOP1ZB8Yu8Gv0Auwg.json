Marketed especially for the geekier among us, the Auld Hoose has great, different, beers, fantastic food which caters just as much to the vegans and vegetarians as it does for the omnivores, friendly and personable staff, and a great, select your own, jukebox. It's not a large pub, and has a tendency to get warm and stuffy when crowded, but it's not usually crowded due to its slightly out of the way location. Don't let that put you off though, it's well worth the extra few steps. Try the nachos!",

It holds one of the best alternative juke boxes in Edinburgh and I often hear people exclaim I have never seen this in a juke box.

Cleverly hidden away in St Leonards from the main drunken weekend crowd, this is the kind of pub where those in the know go to hang out, wear black and be alternative together, and the music choice caters very much to this crowd with one of the best jukeboxes in the city. However, what a lot of people might not know is how fantastic the food is at this urban haven of hormones. Sometimes, the most difficult food to get right is the simplest, and this is what they do best  here, filling and traditional meals like pies and haggis are carefully home-cooked to produce tasty, healthy results at very reasonable prices (around 5 up for a main course). Tragically, not even excellent food at great prices will make the local Goths smile, but even they struggle to be depressed here!",

Luckily, the Auld Hoose was nearby. It was time for me to check out their (in)famous mammoth sized meals.  It was very cosy inside and had a nice friendly pub vibe. The menu is simple-burger, burrito, nachos or haggis; all can be made vegetarian or vegan. I ordered the falafel burger with vegan cheese, another friend opted for the \"regular\" vegan nachos and onion rings, another got a chicken burger. My burger cost 6.75 with the student discount which was a bargain for a big eat.   One start down for the time it took to receive our meal. The bar lady warned me it would take around 40 minutes, but it took more like an hour! We were hungry by the time our food arrived! The so-called regular nachos actually featured a mountain of nachos. The vegan cheese wasn't the best (the starchy type which doesn't melt), but it was generously scattered. The burger was a little more modest, better fitting for my small stature, and I did finish everything. It came with a nice little rocket salad and a pot of tomato relish. Tasty and filling. I ate a few of the onion rings too which were really good and came with guacamole, sour cream (for the omnivores) and sweet chilli dipping sauce.  All in all, the Auld Hoose is a nice little place with tasty food which caters for veggies and vegan. We waited for a long time but at least it was in a nice setting.",

I knew it was somewhere near us and luckily we found it thanks to dumb luck, we were pleasantly surprised.  It's a traditional decor, dark wood with wee stools and archaic lamp shades. A long island bar with a glorious single real ale pump, serving nuclear craft ales, this session was Tiny Rebel's Hadouken, and it was like a drop kick in the face. The staff were suitably punk, and I'm not talking brew dog hipster punk either.  Now, the special thing here is the jukebox, its jam packed with some of the most awesome rock and punk albums ever, and one of my drinking companions could have spent a fortune on it. Lucky for him we were on a strict 2 beer max per pub rule.  I want to go back to this pub on a Friday night and meet some of the locals, I think this would lead to some great drinking stories. Awesome selection of shots etc also...",

We wanted somewhere close by to get something quick and easy to eat, and despite initial fears upon seeing the menus at the Auld Hoose, being both sparsely populated and plastic coated, there was really nothing to worry about.  The menu proudly claims that the nachos are \"probably the biggest in Edinburgh\" and four of us feeling adventurous chose to take on the challenge. Fortunately another two people turned up because these nachos... were HUGE. Seriously - go and check the picture I added. They happily fed six people. SIX GROWN PEOPLE! That;s ridiculous.  Happily it wasn't just quantity over quality, as the toppings on the nachos were pretty delicious, particularly the chilli itself. People at other tables seemed to be enjoying burgers and other assorted pub grub, and I'd happily come back to try any number of other things from the menu - which ranges from the aforementioned burgers to classics like Stovies and Haggis, Neeps and Tatties.  The Auld Hoose is first and foremost a bar though and there were a good deal of beers and ales on offer - not to mention an awesome metal jukebox and happily you don't need to be tatted from tete to toe to fit in - having come straight from work at the time I was *slightly* overdressed, but no one batted an eyelid in my direction. What a lovely place.  More places with HUGE food and less attitude please.",

    "text": "No. I'm not a lagerboy  Well...more likely, not a \"lager-auld-boy\", if age still matters :)  My intention, going to the Auld Hoose, was to try a genuine and traditional Scottish Breakfast. The place looks happily aged and the people at the tables on the left of the entrance, under the direct daylight looked happy (and chatty) as well.  I went on the rightside (where daylight looked like an exotic promise) not because I love the cosy darkness, but because there I saw some smaller tables, good for a single tourist like me.  Before I was able to understand how the ordering policy was, a very friendly bartender was waving his hand asking me if I wanted something to drink (now I know that I should have ordered at the bar desk :/). Firstly I ordered the desired Scottish breakfast, then I asked him for an advice about beers and ales on tap. His answer was effective and tasty. He simply took two glasses, describing the flavours of a couple of hand pulled nectars he kindly pushed towards me. Both were delicious. I chose the Hobgoblin because I thought it could be the best option to drink with the breakfast. This choice made me desert the field of the lagerboys :)  The food was less memorable, but good enough. The slice of haggis was the best part of the dish, in my opinion.  Haggis has been a great surprise and a wonderful one. I never suspected that from those ingredients it was possible to create such a flavourful \"delicatessen\".  Great beers, good food, friendly atmosphere, music not too loud it's all what I was hoping to find, and I found it all.",

The Hoose also provide some proper \"Man Vs Food\" style portions of tasty pub grub. The nachos clearly stand out but even the steak pie or chili will fill you to the brim. I also like the jukebox, it is the proper CD playing kind and has a little sign requesting that folks don't repeat an artist/tune meaning the music (while all industrial, rock, metal or goth) is ever changing.

    "text": "I had done a little research in my quest to try out some Real Ale pubs.  Any beer fan from the US and probably all of North America will understand the novelty and interest in cask conditioned beers.  The Auld Hoose came up in my research to be within walking distance to my hotel.  So, of course my first night in Edinburgh I made a beeline straight for this establishment.  It was early on a Wednesday evening so the place wasn't packed.  There were a few tables occupied and at that moment it was nice and quiet.  As I had expected, I had several real ales available to try.  Since I'm not local, I asked the bartender about my options and he happily helped me with my choice.  My group and I were only a little hungry so we thought we'd have a few items to share while enjoying our beers.     Ok so I'm from Texas which is arguably the world epicenter for tortilla chips, salsa and nachos.  Please don't laugh when you learn that yes I did order their nachos.  It was part curiosity and part frustration with my group's different eating preferences.  So yes, the Texan in Edinburgh kicked off his first night with...nachos.    If you've ever played Jenga, that's what these nachos reminded me of.  The sizable plate was stacked dangerously high.  Fortunately, the mass did not collapse and fall on the floor while we strategically snagged bites to eat.  You know what?  These nachos  were also pretty good.  Definitely not Tex-Mex, but still tasty and better than I had expected.  The other reviewers were spot on with the music played here. It's definitely not easy listening but it also wasn't being blasted either.  It was easy to have conversation.  So even if you're not a fan of heavier rock music, I don't think you'd be too put off visiting at this time of day.  My only complaint was the name. Every time I said the \"Auld Hoose\" it sounded like I was trying to speak with a very bad Scottish accent.  Actually, I secretly loved that part...hehe  This place delivered what I expected.  I got to relax for a bit, enjoy some real ales and snack.  This is a place to visit and visit again.",

And if you're into your whiskies, then you'll be in heaven here as they have over 20 different types, ranging from the Highlands to as far afield as Japan.   If you're more of a real ale drinker, the good thing about this place is the constantly-changing selection of guest ales to choose from, alongside the two resident ones.  But there are lots of girl-friendly drinks to choose from too: their house wine is definitely among the nicer ones I've had a pub recently and the white is always nicely chilled.  The main thing I love about this place though has to be the food. If you're a student you get 10% off, and the portions are really generous so it's great value for money. Don't make the mistake I did though... you will not be able to finish the nachos on your own. Not if you plan on doing anything other than sleep for the rest of the day, anyway.   They also do really good burgers, and you build the exact combination of fillings yourself so you're bound to end up with one that you like. I've never had the sunday roast myself, but that's what i'll be having next time I go here, as my flatmates rave about it.  Why not five stars then? The music. The jukebox is purely punk/metal/gothic, and although it's not blasted really loud like most metal pubs, I just find it a bit of a weird combination with the traditional decor and mainstream food.  Don't let that put you off though... if I could have rated this 4 1/2 stars I would have.",

    "text": "Went to the Auld Hoose with a group of Yelpers in search of nachos.  Well, it wasn't much of a search, we had previously been informed that this place has the biggest nachos ever - seriously see the pictures!!  So I came armed with a hunger to match.  3 of us shared a bowl of these Mega Nachos that are suggested for 3-4.  They came pretty quickly and looked amazing when they did.  Great ratio of toppings to nachos, as so often there is just not enough.  Chilli beef, guacamole, sour cream and cheese throughout.  It took us a good 20 minutes or so to make a serious dent in the mound and start to get to the underneath layers, which were still hot.  After eating about a quarter of the bowl myself, I really should have stopped, but as I hate wasting food and the other 2 had had enough, I just kept shovelling it in....literally.....using the nachos to shovel up the toppings.  Big mistake.  When I finally finished all the toppings, apart from some jalapenos which are a little on the spicy side for my mild palate, there was a only a handful of nachos left.  About 15 minutes later, when I got up to use the bathroom, I realised just how full I was - serious muffin top and struggled to do my pants back up.  Walking home was not at all comfortable, more of a waddle.  Then I seriously needed to lie down and stretch out.  I don't hesitate to say that these are the best nachos I've ever had.  I just wish we had a 4th person to help us eat the monstrosity.  As for the pub; it is quite small, but with character.  Laid back staff, heavy rock playing in the background, not your usual pub music.  Would definitely go back for the nachos alone, but I might give it a while!",

    "text": "The Aulde Hoose is a hilarious combination of old man pub meets metal heads. In the best possible way. There are quite a few awesome things about this pub, one of them being that it's massive, so there's pretty much always a place to sit. Another being that it has a very very good selection of ales and cidres. And and and! They serve Cairn O'Mohr by the glass, though I normally go for the whole bottle (with friends!). Ahem.  Even though it's a massive space, relative to all the other good pubs in Edinburgh that tend to be quite tiny, it's not overwhelmingly huge and doesn't get obnoxiously loud. On tap, they've got a delicious cidre, the name of which escapes me, though I remember it being rare and tasty. They have Fraoch and Hobgoblin, too, which aren't that easy to find on tap anywhere in Edinburgh.   Definitely stop by the Auld Hoose if you're looking for somewhere full of delicious ales to have a drink. Especially if you're in a larger kind of group.",

    "text": "The Auld Hoose is a great pub, and despite being a off the beaten track, once found is a keeper. It is one of the few rock pubs in Edinburgh and this is immediately obvious upon entering and seeing the bar staff and customers. This is an advantage though, as there is always a community feel in there and you get very few obnoxious lads so it all lends itself to a pleasant drinking environment. This is only let down by the Jukebox; The Auld Hoose prides itself on having one of the only goth and rock jukeboxes in Edinburgh. I do love my punk and hardcore, but the music is just too loud, especially as the pub has a sit down and chat kind of vibe to it not get up and have a mosh. When the jukebox is turned down a bit though (very occasionally) it's a really good place to have a natter.  They also are proud to sell real beers, not just lagers. Yes you can get a Tennents if for some unknown reason you would actually want one but they have good ales as well and one of the best pints of Guinness around. There are good bottled ciders and also Crabbies.  But the jewel in the crown is that as soon as they heard Sailor Jerry was taking the Vanilla out of its rum they bought up a load of the old style bottles so it's one of the only places in Edinburgh to get the good Sailor Jerry before it turned rubbish. You will pay a bit more here than most places for a pint but as long as you go for a good one and not just some crappy lager then it's worth it.  The food is immense here as well. Students get a 10% discount but the reason it's so great is that it is huge. The plates are massive compared to other pub portions. The burgers are great as well, as is the Sunday lunch. They have platters which can easily fill two people and all for a reasonable price.   Overall it is a great pub, the only downside is that the music, whilst great if you like rock and metal, is just too loud. If you get there on one of the few days where it's turned down a bit then you will find yourself in one of the best pubs around",

    "text": "The Auld Hoose is excellent.  Located just off of the bustling hive of student frenzy that is the main streets of Newington, it offers a great alternative for those who often find themselves craving a change of scene from the mainstream unions and bars.    One of the things that dramatically stands out about this place is the music.  The jukebox is full of metal and rock, allowing a more subtle means of enjoying these genres than the more extreme establishments such as Opium on the Cowgate.   The choice of drinks here is vast, lots of ales and wines are available including Hobgoblin on tap! This offers a welcome relief from the common draught lagers that are usually prominent elsewhere. There is a great variety of wines, and the choices are handsomely presented on blackboards located within.    The food is great, and the large portions offer excellent value.  A particular highlight for me would be the nachos, they are HUGE. I went with three of my other guy friends, all of whom are large loons requiring a good feed, and we struggled to finish it. They come lashed with chilli, sour cream, guacamole and a generous quantity of cheese. Delicious. I haven't tried any of the other meals on offer but scrolling down the menu there are many traditional dishes such as fish and chips and steak pie.  I guess the main downside of this place is that it can sometimes seem a bit dark and claustrophobic when it gets busy. Finding seating usually isn't a problem unless you leave your arrival until quite late on Fridays or Saturdays. However, the music can sometimes be too loud and not to everyone's taste.",

This is when we learned that The Auld Hoose did not do things by half measures. And, boy, do the gigantic nachos live up to their name. They are comically huge and quite a sight to see. - Far, too much for three, but we were willing to give it our best shot!  I'm not a vegan but I'm currently off dairy for the moment and was dining with a vegan so the vegan nachos were just the kind of thing we were after and kept everyone happy. I'm always keen to dine vegan and the Auld Hoose proves, yet again, that vegan food can be every bit as good, if not better, than the alternative.   With an impressive range of beers available and a menu that had my vegan friend swooning over the choice she had, I'd say I'm a fan of the Auld Hoose after just the one visit.

I ordered the regular size and laughed when the guy at the bar wrote 'small' - the two of us made a valiant effort and still left enough nachos to feed a third person. A third friend with us, being vegan, funnily enough didn't fancy sharing our full cow beef chilli on the nachos!. I am assured that the vegan chilli hot dog she had was very good, and just serves as proof that vegan food doesn't have to be healthy. We also ordered some onion rings for the table and when the totem-pole of deep fried onion arrived we gasped and photographed it in awe. But again, even with the awesome dips we just couldn't eat that much.  You get plenty of food for your money at The Auld Hoose, and there's plenty of choice across carnivore/vegetarian/vegan options without it being too fussy, which is great. They've a good selection of alcohol on tap - I enjoyed a very refreshing cloudy cider.  The ambiance is chilled, and the jukebox is well stacked with something other than your regular pop tunes, although the music is (thankfully) neither loud nor imposing. After we had eaten we spotted the cage full of board games and we (obviously) had a quick round of CaH while we finished our drinks.  Definitely a place I would return to, but especially if I was entertaining a vegan friend",

Also, I hate onions- I flat out refuse to eat them and I could eat the onion rings here all day long.

They have a good range of beer and other drinks including a full range of the Fentimans soft drinks.  It can be difficult to get a table at some times but it's worth waiting or asking to share a table.

Their menu is brilliantly labelled for vegans and vegetarians; they have burritos and nachos that have their standard ingredients and if you eat meat, they can add beef or chicken.  Vegetarian?  More veg and dairy cheese.  Vegan? More veg and vegan cheese. Job done.  They also have a raspberry sorbet suitable for vegans (as well as two dairy options) and chips and spring rolls, meat and veggie/vegan breakfasts, and scampi and meaty pies.  Lots of comfort foods which hopefully would suit any diet, not sure about their glutenfree options though.  However, unless you have a corn allergy or are watching your salt intake you can't usually go wrong with nachos, and they do massive, massive sharing portions of them!  On check in on the Yelp app I also got a free shot of sake.  Woo! That's worth it for going in for a drink alone!  They also have a handwritten list of different alcohol choices they've compiled which they know - as much as anyone can find out - are and aren't suitable for vegans (filtered with fish/egg/other); it's a bit tricky getting that info even when you've been vegan for years and send companies emails etc etc, so it's a nice touch.  Not all restaurants which are vegan-friendly for food think about this, so definitely an added bonus.  They have a wide selection of craft beers and guest ales so I think it's worth trying something a bit different from the Heinekien and Hoegarden (much as I do enjoy them).  The only thing not really my bag is the music, but there aren't that many places which play Stock, Aitken and Waterman tracks on a loop - or have customers apart from me who would appreciate that - so I can't really be too picky on that one.",

    "text": "Not the best looking pub, but nice enough.  We found one staff member very nice and helpful and the other not that great. He seemed to be working alone at the time he served us and the pub was busy, so maybe that's why.  The range of drinks wasn't the best but sufficient for a quick drink and rest after climbing Arthur's Seat.  Feeling a bit peckish we ordered the giant nachos... And they were huge! They easily served the 7 of us.  We did ask for more sour cream and guacamole as half way through there were loads of tortilla chips left but not as much topping. We had to pay extra for this - it would have been nice customer service just to add a little more and no charge in my opinion.  When checking in we received a free shot of Sake. Nice to have a freebie but thought Sake was a bit random.   We received a 10% student discount on the nachos which was handy.  All in all okay, but I wouldn't rush back.",

    "text": "This pub is pretty cool...nothing extraordinary or bad to say about the place. The bar tender were quick with the drinks but one of them was a bit weird cause we didn't get carded when my friend and I ordered alcohol but when she went and ask for water the dude at the bar demanded to see her ID... Like really?! lol... Hahah. I guess you Gotta be over 18 to drink water at this place lol.   Anyways the place is big so loads of places to sit. The nachos were pretty good, they give you more than a healthy portion. The place can get loud when there's a big crowd and if you're not really into the uni crowd this might not be a good place for you to go to. This is also a good place to have a big group get together if you need a big space to socialise.",

    "text": "A cosy Edinburgh pub with friendly staff, whopping nachos and a nice vibe. I like it!   I visited for a covert meeting of which I cannot reveal any of the details ... let's just say there were lots of hungry people who'd ordered two portions of nachos between 8 people before we'd arrived. I thought this was pretty optimistic when I saw the size of the nachos - these are indeed as gigantic as you've heard.   Large doesn't always mean good though (ahem) but I'm happy to report these were excellent. The tortilla chips were plentiful, obviously, there was LOADS of topping and the beef chilli was super tasty. My only suggestion would be a side plate to eat off as it was a little bit messy at times.   I wasn't drinking on this visit but their orange and lemonade is well tasty, and not too expensive either. There is parking right out the front if you're driving through from Scotland's best city for a visit, and the staff will make you feel both warm and welcome.",
