    "text": "There's all sorts of incredibly good Italian in town, and Rigatoni's is no exception. We had a tough time getting in- we'd wind up popping in for lunch once they were closed, or for dinner on their night off, but once we made it in, we were certainly happy about it. The owner is a real character who will touch every table in the tiny place, let you know what's best and give you a deal on their wine special. You cannot go wrong with any of their pasta-- Boyf got the Amatriciani, I got al forno, and we swapped back and forth since both were delicious) but the real standout for me was the Nutella cheesecake-- it's more like a cream pie or mousse, there's no cheesecake tang to it, and it's light as air, but rich with that Nutella glory. I wouldn't have ordered it, but the owner insisted, saying \"you want this\"-- and he was right.   Decent prices, intimate local feel: a nice place to have a quick but quality meal.",

We were given a specific collection time, and when we arrived the pizzas had been sitting there for much longer, not being kept warm and looked old & cold. The restaurant didn't offer to warm them up, even after I complained that they didn't look good.  I really should have just left them and not paid as they weren't good even after reheating in our oven at home.",

After I said the meal was great the owner immediately went into the kitchen to tell his team.  I like that!   It is a must for every trip to Edinburgh, just a short walk from tourist area.",

Al dente noodles, fresh, delicious marinara and just the right balance of flavors in every dish made the meal perfect. Add an amazing Nutella cheesecake for dessert and it was elevated to sublime! The owner/chef Stefano came to the table and could not have been more gracious as were his wife and son who served us.",

    "text": "I have been coming here since it used to be called nyam nyams. Though a little further away from the city centre, the new location of 'rigatoni's' is much more spacious and comfortable for a meal out.   I was first introduced to this place by some of the Italian community, and quickly saw why. This is a family business, and the manager and his wife are Italo-Scozzesi, their family is originally from near Napoli. Both are bilingual and very friendly, expect good and very informal customer service.   On offer are pizzas, pasta, panini(s), risotto, ravioli, gelato, a particularly famous tiramisu and a few daily specials. I have tried the pizza and pasta. The pasta is really good, al dente and flavoursome. There is also gluten free pasta available, which is handy for me, given that I am avoiding wheat. The pizza is a little bit small considering the price, though it's quite nice. The turkish delight icecream is absolutely divine... The tiramisu is probably one of the best in Edinburgh, apart from my own homemade own of course.  A few Italian products which cannot be easily found in Scotland are also for sale, including mulino bianco biscuits, antipasti and instant polenta.",
