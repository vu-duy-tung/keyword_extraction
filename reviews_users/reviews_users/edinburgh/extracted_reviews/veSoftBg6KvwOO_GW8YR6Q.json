In our escalating panic and hunger we found only niche eateries: chain coffeeshops where students sit for seven hours drinking lattes, obscure looking cafes selling seventy kinds of coffee and three types of cold quickbreads, and a cake shop.  Coffee Mill saved us with their quiet, unpretentious atmosphere, great service, and big honking breakfasts: eggs, cheese, toast with generous amounts of jam, bacon, perfectly fried tomatoes, beans, steaming hot potato scones, fried mushrooms, and the morning paper. Getting up from the table was a challenge.   It's a shame more folks don't eat here.",

Among the strip joints and second-hand bookshops, it's reassuring to know that there's somewhere nearby that just sells straightforward coffee and sandwiches.  Half of this shop is dedicated to take-away, half to sit-in tables.  It's always been quiet when I've been, making it an ideal spot to retire for a read of any recently purchased books.  The staff are always smily and friendly, almost to the point of excess, and there's something especially delicious about the coffee they sell. The food they do is basic - baked potatoes, filled rolls etc. - but makes a perfectly satisfying lunch.  All in all, there's not much more to say about the Coffee Mill.  There's nothing remarkable about it, but that's ok, some things don't need to be remarkable.",

The Coffee Mill came up with decent reviews, and they had the Scottish Breakfast, too!    The menu had a little bit of everything, but since I knew we would be walking the Castle, I wanted a hearty breakfast and chose the English breakfast. Stephen chose the Scottish breakfast, which included blood pudding and haggis, which containing sheep's pluck (heart, liver and lungs) minced with onion, oatmeal, suet, spices, and salt, mixed with stock, traditionally encased in the animal's stomach though now often in an artificial casing instead.    The breakfast was very filling, and they even accepted Apple Pay!  Bellies full, we are off to visit the Edinburgh Castle",

Extremely friendly. Very welcoming. Even on their super busy Saturday morning, they're still super nice :)  And the woman from Latvia is not only super friendly but also has a great sense of humor :-D  They have delicious food, and I am completely hooked on their haggis morning roll (don't let its unassuming appearance trick you into thinking that it's not as amazing as it is). In fact, it's hard for me to review their other foods, which all seem good and well-priced, because of how hooked I've become on this roll. This is totally not like me- usually it's the bf who gets into the rut of ordering the same thing over and over again, but I'm telling you- the haggis morning roll is JUST THAT GOOD!!  Btw, don't let yourself get stuck in the mindgame that afflicts so many people, Americans in particular, when it comes to haggis. It's just tastes like spicy ground beef, and it's no worse than what we eat in hot dogs.  They have several drinks to choose from. And they have a short assortment of healthy smoothies to choose from- I've tried all 4 and they're all good.   Their fruit scones have something pink in them (cranberry? cherry?) in addition to the raisins and they are YUMMY as well. In fact, I often end my meal with the scone so that I have that as my parting and longest-lasting taste in my mouth. My only request would be for there to be an option to get some Devonshire cream for the scones, but currently they do already provide some spritz whipping cream for it.   Now, I'm just trying to figure out how to get some of these haggis morning rolls back across the pond with me :)",

I ordered the American breakfast and it came with scrambled eggs, cheese, I subbed the bacon for turkey sausage and toast with jam. The eggs were creamy, cheese grated fresh, turkey sausage had a hint of spice and smokey (my fav). I ordered a coffee with milk (the best coffee I've had in Scotland). I'm very happy I got to experience one good meal! I highly recommend this little cozy/quaint place.",

Service was quick and attentive with the waitress checking in on me every now and then for water. They also have a good selection of cakes and baked goods. Coffee wasn't bad either so I definitely would recommend this location for your local Scottish fare.",

Some might think the American coffee is not strong enough, but for me it was just right and the scrambled eggs delicious.   Considering the location,  even the prices are right and you won't feel ripped off.  Will I be back? Yes, defo!  It's the perfect breakfast /lunch place.",

But the fried eggs were smashed and cooked through, the tattie scones were flavorless pancakes, and the mushrooms rubbery and lacking flavor.",

I haven't encountered someone so friendly at a breakfast place in so long! I have been a few times and my go to meal is the bacon/cheese/fried egg bagel. It's divine. It also comes with a side salad. It costs less than 5 too.   It's a medium size restaurant, with seating available for about twenty. It's typically busy on the weekends, especially if the Six Nations is on.   If you are looking for a typical Scottish breakfast, then this is your place. It's something your grandfather would make.....but better! Ha!   Overall - food is tasty, service is excellent and fast.",

We popped in for just some sweet treats and hot beverages, although the breakfast and lunch menu looks great. We had two hot chocolates, a latte, a tea, a scone, and a caramel slice. The scone got a tremendous thumbs up from my mother, so well done on that! She preferred the scone here to the one in Kilimanjaro, which is really saying something in my view!  Hot chocolates were nice, but could have been hotter, and the latte was good too. Staff very friendly and welcoming. It was nice to come in from the dreary day outside. I will be back to try lunch and/or breakfast. Recommended.",

Our group got the salmon and eggs, an American breakfast, and a Scottish breakfast, and they were all phenomenal. The American breakfast isn't served with streaky bacon, but that was my only disappointment (It just seems like it's hard to find in this city.)",

The owner, a Mr. Gino, greeted me warmly and chatted while he took my order and then - in True Italian style - flirted outrageously while ringing me up. The place was busy but didn't feel crowded, lots of light and cheerful atmosphere.  My takeaway cup leaked a bit on the walk which was the only downside, so maybe cheap cups? Wouldn't be a problem if you stayed in to eat but a bit of a downer being on the go, I had to drink fast rather than enjoy. The cappuccino was great though!  Wish I could come back and have breakfast.",
