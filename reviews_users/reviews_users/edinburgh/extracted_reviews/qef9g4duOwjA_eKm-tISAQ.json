    "text": "I came alone for an early dinner after traveling all day, there were Indian restaurants all around, but I just so happened to stop by in here because it was recommended to me. It was quiet and I was the only customer inside until I was nearing the time to leave when a couple came in, too.   I got a mango lassi, which is always my favorite, can't go wrong with a lassi. Also, I got lamb tikka masala, the sauce was so well prepared and tasty. However, the lamb itself felt a bit overlooked? Possibly dry? I would say that the sauce made up for it because it was hands down the best flavor I've ever had. I also got it paired with rice, which strangely I found wasn't included in the meal? I know it is another way to make money, but why would someone have just ordered a bunch of sauce and 5 cubes of meat. I feel like the rice should be included, because that's the meal. Regardless, it was worth the extra 3 in my opinion to complete the meal.  Although the waiter was a bit inattentive and had to be called over for everything I wanted, we did have a nice chat and he brought what I asked for. Also, he boxed up my extra food when I was leaving, and put it in a bag with a spoon for me, which was nice. Lastly,  I got galub jamin (spelling?) for dessert, and they were amazing. Best dessert I'd had in weeks maybe. They were so sweet and soft and I could have eaten possibly 4 more orders to myself!",

Lamb Jalfrezi was outstanding - tender, so flavorful, just the right amount of spice. Chicken Tikka masala was excellent as well. Amazing rice, and garlic naan. Very friendly helpful staff. Such a great meal!",

    "text": "My family and I were visiting Edinburgh for a few days and happened to walk by Golden Ambal on our first evening - so glad we stopped in!! We ordered the lamb biryani, chicken tikka masala, a masala dosa, and a piece of naan to go. Everything was super flavorful and delicious. Also, our order was done really quickly, and I thought the prices were really reasonable too. We only saw the top level of the restaurant, which is just a few tables, but I think they have more tables downstairs. I've tried a lot of Indian restaurants before and this was the best I've had in a long time!",

    "text": "After a busy day of baking 500 cupcakes (don't ask) I was needing feeding and I was in the mood for a curry. Our local favourite had recently closed so we needed to find somewhere new. The spot which is now the Golden Ambal has changed hands several times in the last year so we were a bit skeptical but based on recent Yelp reviews we decided to give it a shot.   I ordered the Paneer Dosa and a side Makhani lentils. David had a lamb dish and a naan, we shared some onion pakoras too. We ordered a collection on JustEat and our order was ready to pick up from the friendly staff in snazzy gold waistcoats when we arrived.   The food - tremendous!! My dosa was light and the filling beautifully flavoured. All the accompaniments came individually packaged and included a delicious home made mango chutney. Far better than the sickly sweet jarred stuff. The onion pakoras were light, tasty and not soaked in grease. David lamb was amazingly tender and in a rich spicy gravy. The star of the show were my lentils. They were awesome! So rich,creamy and delicately spiced.   We were both very pleasantly suprised with the food and the price, coming in at under 20.  I hope it stays around longer than it's previous owners as we have found our new favourite!  Cheers, Amy",

    "text": "This has been a tricky spot in recent times, with three restaurants failing in this spot in the last three years. Fingers crossed for Golden Ambal because I was quite a fan when I visited for lunch. The lunch deal was very good value and the a la carte menu looked to hold some potentially interesting dishes. Worth a go, I'd say.  Overall, we said: \"I was highly pleased with Golden Ambal. This hasn't been a fortunate location, but this iteration is well-equipped to flourish as the fare on offer is very good. I look forward to visiting again, particularly to give their dosas a try. I'd recommend a visit.\"",

    "text": "I have walked past this place so many times and dismissed it as an odd Indian takeaway at best. However it appears to have had a make over. Up stairs only a few tables and mainly set up for take away, down stairs has seating for 50. We went on a Wednesday night about 8pm so we were the only table in. We were however given a warm welcome. The service was great, the food very tasty and very reasonably priced and to top it off its BYOB. I will definitely try here again either sitting in it take away.",
