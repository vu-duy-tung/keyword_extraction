Really perfectly located outside of the Old Royal, you can get a quick, affordable and tasty lunch while waiting to give blood or for an appointment at the hospital.",

The loyalty card is a great idea too.  You can get regular, large or supersize with a variety of fillings.  Basically all I'm saying is try it we all did and we love it",

    "text": "This is a fairly new burrito food truck located outside of the Edinburgh Blood Donor Centre.  It's 4.50 for a burrito, or for 5 for burrito & a drink.  There is one small table and a couple of chairs, and a small wall nearby you could sit at - otherwise there isn't much seating nearby.    I had the vegetarian haggis burrito with rice, black beans, salsa, and their homemade (suitable for vegans) guacamole. The city is really busy right now even just at the very start of the Fringe and it was a nice location just that bit away from the masses; it was convenient for me at that point in the evening for a quick dinner between shows at Chambers Street and the Cowgate.  For the meat eaters they also have haggis, chicken, and Irn Bru pulled pork, and they have a selection of sauces you can add to create even more flavour additions.  I gave 5 because although not exactly a full, relaxing dining experience, judged for what it is - a quick snack on the go - the food was good, the service was great, and the price was reasonable.",
