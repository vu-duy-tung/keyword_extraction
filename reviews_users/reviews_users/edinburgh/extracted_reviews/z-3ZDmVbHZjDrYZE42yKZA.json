    "text": "Even before my half Korean friend and I came to study abroad in Edinburgh, we were ranting about how much we would miss Korean food. There is a minuscule Korean population in Edinburgh, and we were dreading the fact that our moms would not be able to make delicious homemade meals for us.  The first time I heard about Kim's Mini Meals was through my Director of Studies at the University of Edinburgh. He is Chinese and has never tried Kim's himself, but proceeded to tell me how he's only heard good things about Kim's and even printed out a map with directions for me during our meeting.  At that time my friend and I were Edinburgh newbies, so we got pretty lost trying to find this little place. However, after being there once it was very easy to find the next times. We went around 6pm for dinner, and we happily saw many other Koreans at the restaurant. It is quite small, with only maybe 4 tables, but it is super cute and homey. Larger parties need reservations, which you can easily make by calling Kim's. The restaurant is owned by a husband a wife, and they are the cutest little Korean couple. I definitely felt at home, and even spoke to them in Korean. I ordered Dol Sot Bibimbap (rice, beef, vegetables, and an egg in a hot stone pot), and it was more than heavenly, just like my mom cooks it at home. My friend got the regular Bibimbap, and we also ordered Haemul Pajeon (Korean seafood pancake type dish). They also served us free soup and banchan (side dishes that typically come with Korean meals). I cannot tell you how much we enjoyed our meals! We were ecstatic to have found such a delicious restaurant on our first try. When our parents visit Edinburgh, we are definitely bringing them to Kim's.",

On my last visit we shared some Kimbap (like slices of very large sushi) which was pleasant. They also threw in complimentary bowls of soup and small bowls of kimchi etc. I tried the pork bulgogi which came with rice and kimchi and loved it. Maybe I should have stopped there but got carried away and ordered Dolsot Bibinbap which arrived at the table in a very hot dish containing beef, veg, sauce and rice. all topped with a raw egg yolk for you to stir together. Good fun, yummy, but very filling. Never got to the sweet course! Hours later I was still 'oof'ing. Come to think of it was still full the next morning! Perfect for a cold blustery evening.",

I was met at the door by Mr...err...Kim I guess, shown to a table (the last one I might add, the place was packed at 12:30 on a Monday) and had the menu explained to me.  He asked if I was cool with using chopsticks. I am adept at twirling the feeding sticks so laid his mind at rest. I'm not sure what the alternative would have been. Some sort of fork perhaps?  9.50 gets you a lunch inclusive of a shot of soup, three amuse bouche and a sizzling bowl of Bibimbap (which Mr Kim came and mashed up for me as I clearly had no idea what I was supposed to be doing) and a can of rice punch.  In summary; It gets busy - book ahead if you don't want to wait. The food is good.",

As a Chinese who had a lot of Korean food in China, I would say this restaurant serves real Korean food. The staff there will even teach you how to eat their food properly, and serves you with a little candy when you're finished. The only shortcoming would probably be that there are always a lot of people waiting as it's so popular!!!",

    "text": "Kim's is one of those places I became interested in through Yelp reviews. And I will agree for the most part that they aren't wrong.  The quality of the food is high. In two visits I've sampled several dishes either directly or by pinching from fellow diners. Of the starters I've done no wrong; the Ddeokbokki (rice cake, fish cake and veg) amazingly spicy and full of flavour, and their range of jeon (pancakes) including potato and chillies, or spring onion and seafood have all been very tasty.  My first visit saw me try the Sundubu Jjigae, a spicy stew of tofu and pork meat which was flavoursome and plentiful if in need of a little more pork and little less tofu. Pork Bulgogi was the order of the day second time round and what a meal that was.  Family run, the Kims are very charming and helpful. Mr Kim does the rounds, looking after his guests with a personal touch. His son also does a great job waiting on us time after time.  The let downs for me are in the lack of options, the menu seeming to be padded out with a variety of the same dish, for example Bulgogi is listed four times on the menu (Osam, Chicken, Pork and Beef) where one listing with the various options subheaded would work fine. Same with the Jeon starters and the Jjigae mains. I know this is a small family business but would it hurt to put a few specials on each week to broaden our experience of Korean cuisine?  The other niggle for me are the prices. A main at lunch is around the 8-9 mark, wheras dinner is up around 12-13.  The latter is too much. The former more realistic and reasonable. This isn't fine dining, this is what the Kim's know and do best. There are no feats of gastronomy or luxurious surroundings to tempt us into splashing our cash. The produce hasn't been shipped in from some far off organic chicken farm or fishing bay. The Kim's keep things simple and small; their prices should reflect that. Even their corkage (1.50 per bottle of beer) is over the odds.  I'll happily dine here again. The food and family are lovely. But I'll be trying the cheaper Korean restaurant across the road before I do.",

    "text": "Went here last night after reading glowing reviews on Yelp and I wasn't disappointed.  The restaurant is very cosy, shall we say, and my two friends (both of whom aren't what you would call petite) had to fight our way into the corner which made things  tight but maneagable. We had fried tofu to start with between the three of us (the starters are all large) .There were four big pieces of tofu sitting in a sweet soy sauce covered in fresh chopped veg, sesame seeds and chilli. The veg included tomato and cucumber which gave the plate a  freshness, while the raw chilli gave it spice and the sesame seeds a nice mellow nuttiness,the sweet soy sauce completed the picture. So far so good. Then came the mains, I'd gone for pork ribs as suggested by our waiter and again I was not disappointed. A large bubbling cauldron of loveliness was placed before me . The sauce was boiling violently and it was suggested by the waiter (this time unneccessarily) that it would not be wise to touch it! About 7 or 8 healthy sized pork ribs stuck out of the frothing morass like something out of 'The Flintstone's\".  My friend had the vegetarian bibimbap, a Korean favourite, essentially    various chopped veg and a fried egg, on top of a bed of sticky rice, with a spicy, sweet sauce. My other friend had the pork bulgogi  which came with rice and lettuce. Mr Kim demonstrated how you use  the lettuce to wrap up the meat with a small amount of rice, like a small sushi roll.  The meat was covered completely in the sweet, slightly salty, spicy Korean sauce that seems to be a large part of the cuisine. Back to the ribs, I gingerly grasped one from the bubbling pot of hades with my chopsticks and brought it to my mouth, it was delicious. This is an oft' used cliche, but  the meat literally fell off the bone, it was so tender.The fat had almost completely melted away leaving a lovely silky richness and depth of flavour, yet there was still just enough texture and flakiness to give the meat some structure.  They were in  a sweet soy soup  and I finished it completely (there was a smattering of fresh mushrooms and sesame seed as well) and the rice was sticky and dry which made it easy to eat using chopsticks. We had 4 or 5 complimentary sides which is common in Korean restaurants including the obligatory Kimchi (spicy pickled cabbage), broccolli covered in spicy red sauce, cold sweet egg rolls, some sweet fish cakes (sort of rubbery but nice texture, again in spicy sauce) and some cucumber with spicy sauce.  Only two small issues,  one the small space  and secondly compared to other Korean restaurants I've been to the size and number of the complimentary sides was pretty small but this may have been due to the lack of space on the table. It was very reasonably priced, all the above came to only 41 pounds including corkage and  an adorable 'dessert' ,consisting of a strawberry and piece of sponge cake skewered on a cocktail fork! So in conclusion  I'd say, GO GET THEM THERE RIBS!! :-) It's wise to book in advance, particularly at the weekend.",

Although I guess having two tall (very tall) blond blue-eyed Dutchies walk in kinda betrayed the secret that we were -in fact- not Korean. I've never felt quite that tall before.  Right-o onwards with the food: I had the Scottish beef dish, which I forgot the name of but only because it was so splawesome that I couldn't remember my conversational skills while I was eating it. I could only think about the beef and when it would be polite to take another bite. He had the stone-pot which looked amazing, but was a wee bit spicy for me. Keep in mind, if you're not that good with spicy (I'm not) ask before hand, and when in doubt, get the Scottish beef. It's just .. well .. it's now a full 10 hours later and I still can't think up a good description. THAT's how good it was.  Did I mention this is ridiculously cheap as well? And that they have Delfts blue clogs and Van Gogh pictures hanging about? I didn't?   Well what are you looking at me for? Don't take my word for it, go check it out for yourself!",

I'd take people there who were keen to try something a little different. But I can't say it's particularly high on my own personal list of places for a repeat visit.\"  Having said that, I have booked to go back with a group of work colleagues (mainly because one of them is named Kim ;-)), because I did like their schtick, the lovely china place settings, and the service, hence the four stars.

Unlike Shilla, your prices are pretty reasonable, and when asked to convert my dolsot bibimbap from meat-based to not, not only did you do it, but you checked to see if I would eat an egg or not. Your kimchi jeon was crunchy and flavourful, with little grease, although I would have preferred a wee dipping sauce to go with it, it did stand on its own. Dolsot didn't give me my craven crunchy bits and as the sauces were already added I didn't get to make choice on the level of spice, but it was good and full of vegetables.   In my limited experience, Korean restaurants present you with some wee amuse bouche type things - here was fried anchovies, marinaded courgettes, KIM CHEE (take that Shilla and your charging to have that on top!), and some spiced aubergine. You would be perfect if that honeyed potato was included, but I pick, I pick. That, and the potato soup to start were tasty and the price at the end was incredibly reasonable.   Service was a little slow to start, but picked up quite rapidly after, with us barely finishing the kimchi jeon before beef bulgogi and my bibimbap appeared. Could do with a little more pacing. I would also argue that the menu is quite small (and why so much spam!) but flexibility helps broaden that out!  But overall, I am extremely happy with Kim's Mini Meals - it's tiny, but lovely.",

I ate an exceptionally nice pork and squid in red curry paste with pineapple dressed salad dish with their very lovely sticky rice.   The owner did a really rather superb sales job. His wife does all the cooking. He clearly just talks it up. She doesn't use any MSG. She cooks with entirely natural ingredients - a lot of citrus fruits to get the right strength of flavour. The result is a delicate and incredibly subtely flavoured treat.   The only pity about the place is they don't serve beer. But this is easily fixed as they welcome BYOB. So go prepared and you'll be enchanted.",

The menu is very limited, but they definitely specialize in what they make. The shop is only open for dinner from 5:30p to 8:30p and only open for 6 days a week. I recommend getting there a early because the the restaurant only has 6-7 tables. Lines form early and will wait the entire 3 hours is necessary to eat. I highly recommend the bibimpop and rice cakes with fish cakes. The meal comes with the traditional korean side dishes. Seriously. Come check out Kim's Mini Meals.",

I love, love, love bibimbap even before I became a vegetarian so I was so excited to have it. I asked my husband how would he rate his dish.  He said, \"Solid five stars.\" Both our dishes came with banchan (side dishes), which is typical in a Korean restaurant. I love banchan! The hot stone bowl kept our food hot until we finished the last scoop. I noticed this restaurant when I was walking on the street it was on. There was a line outside, which made me curious and searched online for it.  It IS a small restaurant that's why customers have to wait outside. The wait time is about 20 minutes or so (it's worth the wait!). They only accept cash. The wait staff were super nice and friendly.  The ambiance is really cozy and nice decor as well. I will definitely go back to this place when I visit Edinburgh again!",

Also, the place is one of the few restaurants in Edinburgh where you possibly have to wait in line, which means it's very popular. The best part of Kim's, though, is the service.

For 8 we got a soup starter (pea soup-not very Korean but tasty and warming), a little taster of vegetables and kitchen (my friend ate the chicken as I don't eat meat), and our mains with rice. Everything was well presented and colourful, service was fast and friendly (though I have heard from others that the owner often preaches his religious views to customers, we didn't have this experience).   The setting is appropriately cosy, with strangely out-of-place memorabilia from Barcelona and random other ornaments decorating every space, it feels a little cluttered, but bizarrely in a good way.

When we left there were two groups standing out in the cold waiting for tables.  I loved that you get a soup to start (last night was pea soup, which I'm not normally a fan of but it was WELL tasty), then a selection of little bites.. kimchi, pancake, meatballs, pickled daikon and something else which I've forgotten were the offerings last night.  We shared a spring onion pancake as a starter, then followed it up with a bimbimbap for him and a spicy kimchi with tofu & seafood soup for me.. I was well enamoured by the purple rice I got with my soup (you also get one free refill of rice if you need, but I was happily full after the first bowl, tho you may need the second bowl if you decide to forgo a starter).. How much I enjoyed my dinner was evident by the fact that I drank every last drop of soup and left absolutely nothing in the pot..   Drinks wise.. we threw caution to the wind and tried the 'cinnamon punch', 'honey red ginseng' as well as the 'rice punch'.... The rice punch comes with rice in the bottom of the glass which was a bit weird.. even for me... the cinnamon punch was much better than expected and definitely worth a try, as is the honey red ginseng.. both were rather sweet tho.  The menu is pretty small compared to Shilla which is the other Korean option in Edinburgh, but I couldn't pick one over the other. I shall be spreading my love of Korean food between both places!",
