    "text": "A few months ago, when it was that horrible cold outside that just made you want to stuff your face with comfort food and drink hot toddies, we got a pizza in Rapido on our way home.    My man had eaten here before and vouched for the food, but I hadn't, so it was a new experience.  We decided on one of their \"gourmet\" pizzas with the lovely thin Italian base.  We wanted to add peppers to our Estiva (cherry tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, fresh basil - basically a posh version of a Margherita) but we were told NO WAY.  At first I was put off - it's going in MY belly, why shouldn't I be able to put anything I want on it?  But then I remembered the Italian restaurant where I used to work.  Sometimes people would want to tweak dishes and my boss said absolutely no way - he didn't want the uneducated masses ruining his perfect combination of flavours.  The guy at Rapido was the same.  He said he would make any pizza we wanted for the normal pizza, but not his gourmet pizza, it just wasn't on.    So we gave in and waited.    When our pizza was ready, we headed outside in the horribly dreary weather to walk 10 minutes down the road to home.   Unfortunately, by the time we'd arrived, the pizza was pretty much cold.  However, the flavour was wonderful and we gobbled it right up, vowing to get it home quicker next time so we could eat it piping hot.    It really was just what you would picture when getting a good Italian thin crust pizza.",

    "text": "The name 'Rapido' gave me the impression that my fish supper would be cooked, wrapped and payed for within nano seconds of my ordering it.  I was so wrong.  To be fair, it was really busy, but the queue to even place the order seemed to take an age.  When I finally did order it then took another five minutes to get it out the shop!  This was my only main criticism, however, as their menu is huge with plenty to choose from in the way of traditional suppers, pizzas with just about any topping and plenty of cooked sauces to accompany them.   The fish supper cost 4 which was quite reaosnable, considering the fish was good quality, although the chips weren't the best.  Rapido serves pretty decent food, just make sure you bring a good, long book with you for the queue.",

    "text": "Rapido is a great little chippy on Broughton Street, I rate it as one of the best in Edinburgh.  The shop is bright, clean and, surprisingly for a business selling fried food, not at all greasy. They sell all the usual chip shop favourites like fried fish, smoked sausage, haggis, fried pizzas and of course chips. There is also an extensive pizza menu, featuring exciting toppings like gorgonzola and parma ham (believe me, this is exotic for a Scottish chippy!), all of which are freshly made to order on deliciously thin and crispy bases. If you fancy something a little healthier there are baked potatoes, again with lots of fillings to choose from. The counter has a tasty selection of traybakes and I often pop in on my way home from work for a piece of the rocky road, it is gorgeous!",

    "text": "Definitely one of the best chippies I have come across in Edinburgh. It has a mouth-watering selection on food  general fish and chips fare, pasta, pizza, pakora and much more. I am a big fan of their chicken pakora with chilli sauce. It's ridiculously bad for you but you get a hearty portion and the chilli sauce is beautiful. They also do fantastic calzones (sort of like folded over pizzas they trap in flavour). On top of this they have cakes and other sweet treats should you look for something other than savoury. This is the perfect pit stop for any junk food/drunken late night cravings! The prices are reasonable and the food is delicious!",

The Glasgow chain is infamous for their \"sausage\" suppers, containing a squidgy 3 foot long phallus with a meat content of approximately 1%. I found Rapido on the other hand to be a bit higher up the chip shop scale.  It's clean, well put together, and with charming little nametags stuck onto the grub under the heatlamps which I found quite cute. Having only had a fish supper I can't comment on some of the fancier pizza choices, but my treat from the deep was very good. Not a great deal better than your average chippy to be honest, but size able, crispy, and of trustworthy origin.",

    "text": "After burning the dinner, I rescued the night by running round here and picking up Fish and Chips. I was quite impressed by the shop as it seemed to be a little more fancy by the chippy and had a very extensive menu. I probably would have gone for something else, but I was trying to pick something up quickly and when confronted with a large menu by decision making skills do come into question.  So reasonably priced Fish and Chips picked up, back round the corner home. Sad to say, but it wasn't much better than the food I had cremated earlier. The chips were pretty damn awful, so much so I couldn't eat them. Coming from a carbohydrate queen that means something! How do you make bad chips? I don't know, but Rapido managed it. And the fish was distinctly average. I was sorely disappointed.   This place is always busy though and friends have given it good reviews so I guess I went on a bad night.",

I actually visited Rapido when I still ate fish and tried out their fish and chips. I have to say I didn't have as great an experience as some of the others and my chips were, to say the least, a bit greasy. Oozing greese is the worst for me, which is why i''ve more or less given up on these places.  I have to agree with the others that Rapido is clean and smart, a rare and pleasant find. The staff were also perfectly friendly. Maybe I will go and try Rapido again some day and have a better chip experience.",

I didn't find them too greasy, and they were piping hot which is always a mega plus. Cold soggy chips are a no no.  This is quite a stylish chipshop actually, I really liked the exterior and have to agree with Gavin, the wee name flags were a nice touch.  Fab chip-shop and very very popular with the locals.",

Let me start with the price, I was about 3 for a Chip Roll and a can of coke, which I would say is about average these days. They actually go through the trouble of buttering the Roll... take note rival chippys!!!  The chips are like little slices of heaven, not grease what so ever and not overly salted. If the potatoes could think, they would gladly commit suicide in hopes of being a Rapido chip.  The only negative thing I have to say is that the Fish supply is constantly dwindling and expect to find a line of people out the door waiting for the next batch to be fried.",

    "text": "I have lived close to Rapido on and off for a number of years and frequented their counter on many occasions! It's always nice and clean in the customer area, and the staff are friendly. There is the traditional 'chip shop' side to their business, as well as pizza / pasta and a variety of deli items like paninis / salads / calzone. The chips have always been right up my street. I don't know if it's the way they fry them, but they're nice and crispy. Very tasty. Fried food such as haggis, spring rolls and burgers are always decent, and the freshly made pizzas are delicious. Occasionally I've had a pizza which I felt the crust was a bit too big ie. it wasn't topped to the edge  of course I want some crust to dip in my garlic mayo, yes  but I don't want too much crust to the detriment of the toppings! Baked potatoes always nicely cooked and generously filled! I'm getting hungry now! A couple of bad points from only the last couple of years  I bought a panini a while back. I forget the filling, but the sauce in it was off. I had to throw it in the bin. It didn't have a best-before date on it. I do wonder if freshness may be an issue for some of the deli items, as I've seen a staff member late one night covering a tray of 'something' so it could be sold the next day. I can't remember what the product was, but I do remember thinking that it was something that should be made fresh every day. They clearly make large batches of things and intend to sell them for a few days. I ate a spinach and ricotta calzone recently  from another large batch in the counter. It cost 3.70. Looked pretty big and tasty in the display. It was big, but it turned out to be mostly dry, hard bread, with a pitiful amount of filling. For the price I'd definitely expect better. 3.70! They stock a good selection of drinks / ice cream etc and serve coffee during the daytimes I believe, though I usually visit evening / night times. I've phoned for delivery on a couple of occasions but been told it would be over an hour  even though I'm down the road, so I've just walked up to collect. On both occasions it was past ten pm. In my experience Rapido get it right most of the time, and when they do they do it well.",

Along with the usual options of pizzas, jacket potatoes, burgers, they also make excellent wraps and burritos, and about 20 different home made cakes/choccolate slices. As they are open till 1am at weekends (3am during the Festival or Hogmanay) it's an ideal stop-off on the way home from a night out. The food isn't your usual greasy chippie though, so it can be great to use on other nights for the pasta/potato options. They have a couple of tables and chairs plus about a dozen stools by the windows so you can eat your food in the shop if you want - a great option if it's chucking it down outside!",
