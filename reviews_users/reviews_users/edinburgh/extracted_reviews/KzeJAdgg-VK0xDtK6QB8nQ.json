Oh, the aroma!!  We weren't the only ones there at that hour (around 3am), 5 other people were in line for supper  Despite having made the wrong order and having to get them to change it (they were already making it, opps... guilty!), they were very nice about it and told us not to worry.  Finally, they gave us our large chicken kebabs for only 6.50! It had generous toppings and the meat tasted so fresh. I wish I found out about this place earlier!!",

    "text": "I came to Dersim Kebab House just over a week ago with a friend whilst we were on our way to a flat party.  It was the night of the football world cup finala and we were in a rush to get something to eat before getting there.  Thankfully, Dersim served us pretty tasty meals without any hassle at all.   Their menu isn't exactly awe inspiring, but has all that you would expect from a standard kebab house.  I went for a chicken kebab with salad and chips which came to about 3 along with a bottle of water - a pretty good deal.  The chicken, however, was a little dry but I managed to counteract this by squirting on a whole load of mayonnaise.  The salad was fresh and the chips weren't bad at all. My mate had a cheeseburger with chips which he thought was pretty average as well. On the whole it's decent enough, value for money food and friendly service.",

    "text": "I agree with Stuart on certain points - Dersim Kebab House is open late and it's cheap, so in that sense its got its perks. But I'm put off by how glaringly greasy the food is.  I've not seen it open early in the day (to be fair, the thought of getting a kebab before midday is revolting), but illuminated by its strip lighting it looks a bit seedy at night.  Before you get in the door, you are greeted with massive laminated pictures of all the meal deals they do. They don't really try to tart up the appetisers by giving them names, they refer to them in numbers. Not exactly tempting when it's seemingly served up like prison food.  I'm being a bit harsh - the content wasn't actually that bad. Morbid curiosity led me to eat in here and I wasn't actually disappointed. Portions are very generous and the staff are friendly enough.  Don't get me wrong - I've had worse kebabs. But even though I'm basing this critique on the appearance of Dersim Kebab House, it's just as important as what's inside. With the shabby frontage and less than appealing signs in the window, they sell themselves short. The food is decent enough and if it's two in the morning, you could do worse than to hook yourself up with a kebab in here.",

    "text": "Dersim do Kebab's a little differently but because I don't know how they cook them I can't exactly explain why.  But I can be certain of the following.  1) I can go with 10 and feed two people. 2) My food look's like it was cooked that day. 3) Virtually no grease from the Donner meat. 4) Crispy chips, NOT SOGGY! 5) Chatty staff. 6) Open later than you care to be awake.  Set the standard on Dalry road!",
