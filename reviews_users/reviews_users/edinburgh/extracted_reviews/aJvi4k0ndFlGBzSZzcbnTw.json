Slightly tired looking, and if prices came down slightly might have more customers. Would be a four star pushing five but for the last comment.",

The service was rushed and forgetful, the coffee and tea were less than inspiring and the pastries were below average. A sad day.",

    "text": "Vin caffe caters to the Harvey Nichols crowd- its right across the street and has its fair share of posh clientele. This is, I will add, reflected in the price of the fare, most of which you would find halved at any one of the number of cafes in the vacinity. The service is atrocious and scatterbrained, but the appeal lies in the booths available and the quality of the food. The sandwiches are pricey, indeed, but they are delicious. It is the place to go for the day that you are slinging carrier bags a la Pretty Woman and when you want to nosh like Sex and the City. The coffees are stellar and the cappuccinos, in particular, must rank amongst the best in the city. Its not too dear for a latte or the like, so you can have a lazy Saturday morning, provided there's space, to sip your wonderful coffee and go about your business with the reading of newspapers and the like. In the summer, there is a patio out front that is utilitarian and does the job and allows you to gawk at the Chanel clad footballers wivesques who go about their shopping. However, in the winter, you may be hardpressed to find space as the dining area was ill thought out- with two booths taking up most of the space at minimal efficacy- and the bar stools being too close together to truly get comfortable. If you do score a seat, however, and you do have the bills to spend, you'll have a treat- as long as nonchalent service doesn't offend your sensibilities (too much). You may overhear people making multimillion dollar deals on their Blackberry. The toasted sandwiches are made on lovely bread, the stromboli (little sugared Italian donuts) are a wonderful sin, and most inspiring is the cupcake rack that looks to be out of a Madeline picture book. Two stars is what it gets- as per the dire service, the atmosphere, the price, but that is testament, truly, then to the fare on offer- the only reason to go.",

I ate here with a friend at lunchtime. They have about a dozen tables downstairs and another six or so upstairs. So it's quite small. They do more cafe lunch type food rather than big evening meals. In the summer they put some tables outside and it is in a bit of a sun trap (weather permitting obviously!). Valvona and Crolla source their own wine from Italy and it is all excellent.",

Fifteen minutes after ordering food we were told that two of the options were not available and when our replacement orders did arrive the sausage topped pizza contained two small pieces of sausage on what was a warm (at best) pizza.   The beer was nice and they also have a great selection of wines but for the prices you are expected to pay the service was shocking. I did highlight my frustrations on the day but to say that none of the three people waiting on tables were interested, is an understatement.   We chose Valvona and Crolla based on its reputation and convenient location but I am unlikely to recommend it in the future. There are plenty of other cafe venues I the local area that are much better.   I am hugely disappointed with my experience, as were my three friends. You certainly expect at least courteous staff when paying so much and in such pleasant surroundings.",

My friend and I walked in and as downstairs was busy, the waitress advised us to go upstairs instead. We were seated promptly and both of us chose the soup of the day which today happened to be tomato soup. Also ordered a basked of 'pane casalingo', which effectively was a few slices of white bread and a walnut bread. Nice enough.   The waitress was very friendly and told me all the daily specials they had on the menu - but it was soup time for me.  Tomato soup was lovely and creamy, with a dash of olive oil and basil on top. The soup came with more of the white soft bread. I devoured the whole plate in record time :)  This is a nice place to go for lunch,  good quality food and friendly waiting staff.",

Overall, we said: \"I very much enjoyed my pizza at Valvona & Crolla. My fellow questers were delighted with their dishes, too. However, the ambience and the service were rather spiritless, so I'm not sure it's a place to which I'll be rushing back, any time soon. An Italian restaurant with such a stuffy and reserved atmosphere just isn't my thing.\"",

It is part of Valvona and Crolla which is an Edinburgh institution. They have so many locations popping up around the city that you are bound to bump into one. The quality offered is fantastic. The coffee is delicious and my Granny always insists I bring her a back when I go to visit. The cakes. Oh the cakes! This place has the potential to make me very fat based purely on the desserts. The rest of the food is delicious also. Simple, but fresh and tasty. I had some sort of deep fried ball of rice and mozzarella, I couldn't even begin to tell you the name because it was in Italian. But it was so yummy. As are the pizzas.   If your in the city centre and need some lunch, then this is the place to go.",

The seats here are always scarce, and always looks inviting to see people sitting out here, on Edinburgh's fanciest street.

Although the space always seems to be overly crowded, the friendly waitstaff and the terrific food kept me coming back for more.  On my first visit I had the special of two appetizers and a glass of wine for 9.99, a terrific bargain. I got the mushrooms stuffed with capers and tomatoes and mozzarella, the grilled Queen Scallops, and a glass of white wine... I was still hungry and thirsty so I asked my waitress if I could get a second of the special, and I was given the okay -- so I got the salumi assortment, the trio of crostini, and a glass of red wine.  On my second visit I got the calf's liver (cooked medium-rare) with mashed potatoes and sauteed onions, and a side of sauteed cabbage and pancetta, and a side of marinated fennel.  On my third visit I got the grilled Aberdeen Angus Ribeye Steak (cooked rare) with a salad of rocket and parmigiano reggiano, and for dessert I got the bread and butter pudding.  The food is simple and very well prepared -- I really like this place, even though it's proximity to Harvey Nichols makes it perhaps a bit too \"posh\" for some.",

If you're looking for something more substantial for lunch or dinner, Vin Caffe also has a restaurant upstairs which serves some very yummy Italian food concoctions.  The cafe area inside is modern but traditionally Italian at the same time, so there's a really good, homely feel about sitting here with delightful coffee scents in the air, and a selection of paninis and tasty looking cakes on offer. There are also lots of seats at the counter, so you can prop up the bar with your espresso Italian style.  The restaurant upstairs is classy looking and always busy with a mix of people, so there's a really bustling atmosphere while you're dining. The bread served here is amazing, as it's baked in the restaurant's own bakery, and the menu is made up of really fresh, quality ingredients, which after several samplings, I can confirm taste awesome. For a starter, I favour the Antipasto, followed by Pollo Saltimbocca, a pan-fried chicken breast with proscuitto and sage, served with roasted potatoes.",

I just seem to gravitate towards it it's that good.  It's named after the family that run this Edinburgh empire; they have a handful of other food & drink places dotted around the city, but this is definitely their best if you ask me.  I've never eaten in the formal sit-down restaurant upstairs, I've just peeked in whilst on my way up to the loos - which, by the way are immaculate and always have lovely Molton Brown moisturiser for you to use after you've washed your hands. My mum always says you should judge a place by their loos and house wine, and this place definitely ticks the loo box.  On my first trip here, i couldn't control my inner child and ordered one of their ice cream floats. I don't care what anyone says, I'll be ordering these in here until I'm so old I can no longer feed myself, it was that good. Think luxury italian chocolate and vanilla ice cream blended with oreos and topped up with Coke. Not great if you're a dentist, but so worth the sugar content!!!  On my next visit I was feeling slightly less like a five year old, and so I ordered a glass of white wine. The second box in my mum's theory can now be ticked off as well - it was ice cold for starters, and for once it actually tasted like the flowery descriptions that everywhere insists on writing under the name of it on the wine list.   Obviously, you have to eat something in here, otherwise it defeats half the prpose of coming somewhere so nice. The cakes are always changing around, but if they have caramel shortbread on display in the chill counter then you could do a lot worse than order that.",

Wine Coffee, i mean these are already two of my favourite things so put that together and add sounds amazing cakes and baked goods and well lets be honest i was always going to be a happy man.   I went recently with a German friends who said she only had a few hours in Edinburgh so wanted to catch up and then be able to spend a fortune shopping.   This place provides all angles on this, after we had a coffee she wondered off like a kid in a candy shop while i relaxed and read the Sunday Times.   When she returned we had a spot of lunch, i had the Pesce sale e salsa, to you and I its the Italian take on fish and chips, just replace chips with cubed potato. Lovely dish and very good value. My friend had the pizza which also looked and smelled amazing.   So next time your spending a fortune on Multrees walk and are in need of some rest I recommend you stop in and see it for yourself.   p.s. if you just in for coffee have one of the twisty do-nut type things!!!   Jd over and out!",

I do distinctly remember having the most amazing affogato at the end of the meal, presented in a gorgeous way which allowed me to pour the espresso (and I think there was a type of liqueur as well) over the gelato/ice cream, in order to limit melting.    I mentioned this once, and the man went out and bought me the V&C cookbook which has left me so baffled that it sits on my shelf virtually untouched to this day.  Occasionally I leaf through it but there is just no way I can re-create those recipes so on the shelf it remains.    More recently, the man and I had lunch and fancy juice at the downstairs cafe.  We each ordered a panini and shared.  The panini were gorgeous, though after dining upstairs I found the 50s-ish decor a bit unexpected.",

    "text": "We decided to pull up a pew outside Valvona and Crolla on a particularly pleasant sunny afternoon in Edinburgh.  My Yelp-esque nature got the better of me and I popped inside to get the drinks, making my other half feel very ungentlemanly indeed. But needs must.   The food itself is mainly Italian, and all sounded delicious, although somewhat hard to pronounce for those of us who aren't fluent in the lingo!  We were only having coffee and a cake, and there was plenty to choose from. I chose a latte and my boyfriend had a classic cappuccino, but the cakes were the hardest part to choose, for sure. Since I was the one choosing, I opted for the lemon tart to share, which was absolutely gorgeous! One of the best desserts I have ever had, my only regret is I wish I had got one all to myself!  The bill racked up almost 10, which wasn't incredibly cheap, but not overly expensive either, and the coffees were first class, made the way real authentic Italian coffee should be. Divine.",

    "text": "The swanky restaurant part of the Valvolla and Crolla franchise- Vin Caffe is a great Italian eatery and one of my favourite restaurants in Edinburgh. Unfortunately, it's very popular with the Edinburgh elites and has turned into the kind of place you'll find mothers clutching babies wearing Harvey Nicks onesie's and force feeding them a carpaccio starter. Don't let this description put you off though, the food is well worth bypassing the yah's for.  Get a bruschetta selection to start with- it's an order! The mozzarella tastes so creamy and the crab pate sweet and zesty. It's easily enough to allow three people to grab a tasty nibble without filling yourself up too much before mains. The pasta dishes here are always wonderful although be warned, anything that states 'garlic' as one of the main ingredients will have your mouth humming for days! Pizza's are also great- huge portions and ultra fresh ingredients.  Vin Caffe might be a favourite of the yummy mummies but that doesn't mean the rest of us shouldn't get a look in too. Make sure you try it out!",

It's located on Multrees walk- the more upmarket shops are located here so people watching can be quite amusing. The cafe has an open glass front so even if it's chilli and the sun is out you can still enjoy the sun. Because it's part of the Vavona Crolla chain it also has a whole load of cool stuff for coffee and pasta making- a bit over priced of course but good quality.",

    "text": "The Valvona and Crolla Vin Caffe is a stylish shop/cafe/restaurant on Edinburgh's exclusive Multrees Walk. The Vin Caffe is split over two levels with the shop/cafe on the ground floor and the restaurant above. They also have a number of tables and chairs outside on Multrees Walk, which are perfect for enjoying an afternoon coffee when the Scottish weather permits - it's a pretty continental set-up. Valvona and Crolla is one of Edinburgh's oldest and most prestigious Italian delicatessens and the Vin Caffe certainly lives up to the deli's well established good reputation. The coffee is exquisitely made and the tapas-style nibbly dishes are of exceptional quality. When I lived just around the corner I would occasionally come here for a bite to eat on a Sunday afternoon, they do brilliant sausage rolls, however the place is usually packed and it can be a bit of a mission to secure a seat.  If someone else is picking up the bill, get them to take you here - otherwise, keep an eye on the website as they do some good value deals (e.g. two small dishes and a glass of wine for 9.99).",
