The staff is amazing, very attentive and friendly.  WAs lovely hearing about all their charitable causes.  The food was very impressive.  First we were presented with 3 canapes.  All were delicious. We then moved into the scallops starter. The small fishcake was crunchy on the outside and well flavored throughout. The scallops were lovely, and with 4, it was a nice sized portion to share.  For entrees we had the half lobster and the hake.  The lobster was delicious,  seasoned with shallots and a wonderful sauce and put back in the shell.  The hake was flaky and tender, absolutely delicious.    A bit pricey, but absolutely worth it.",

If you are in Edinburgh, Scotland, and you like good seafood, YOU HAVE TO go to the Kilted Lobster. The Chef sent out a small appetizer sampler to every table for no cost, which was nice. I recommend getting a reservation if you can, but they will do their best to accommodate if you don't have one. The halibut, sea trout, and lamb shank were all amazingly delicious meals and wait staff is very friendly and helpful when making recommendations on food choices. ANOTHER really cool thing about Kilted Lobster is that they give back to their community by supporting various organizations and educational programs throughout Edinburgh. Seriously, these folks are top notch and provide an amazing dining experience with great food. Put it another way, it was so good, I decided to write a Yelp review for maybe the 2nd or 3rd time ever.",

Lighting was a bit bright, music was loud and seem to be a heavy 80s mix, with a lot of Spice Girls and Hall and Oates, and the floor was oddly slippery. But as far as the food, meh.  Amuse bouches were tasty.  Then I got the fish, which was a little too salty. It took me a while to figure out if it was the fish, or the sauce, or the potatoes, and once I did I was halfway through and not really interested in getting another piece of fish. The fish tasted like fish. It wasn't bad, it wasn't great.  Service was a little strange-we had some leg of lamb leftovers, and the waiter very explicitly explained to us that since it was meat, it needed to be refrigerated. I thought that most adults would know that, so it was odd that he made such a big deal out of telling us.  A little pricy for the experience.",

    "text": "It's almost like, the closer you live to a place the longer it takes to actually check it out. But alas, I can finally say I've been.    So let's cut to it. It was...ok. As you all already know from reading all my reviews, I like to talk about my experience from beginning to end.   So firstly, the Kilted Lobster is small. As in, you can hear every conversation happening over lunch or dinner and if you feel so inclined, you could just lean over and add your two cents. So, you know, if you want an intimate and romantic time, just be mindful that everyone in the restaurant can hear you.   Service was great. Our server was extremely friendly, often checking up on us during our meal which led to some back and forth conversation which sometimes can get a big much.   The food was nice. Obviously it's all about seafood here and I can't fault the effort they put into it. To start my partner and I shared the mussels, which was more than enough for two. Very tasty and served with some bread, the sauce was delicious and quickly quite filling.   For our mains: the half lobster and the cod with a vanilla buerre-blanc and grilled asparagus.   Both beautifully presented, and that's what I mean. The effort is there! Unfortunately, the flavour is not. My cod was beautifully cooked though underseasoned, and the buerre-blanc was so vanilla-ey (it's a word now) it was almost like eating fish with an extremely thick vanilla custard. I would have liked a bit more citrus to brighten the dish as it was quite heavy overall. My favorite part was the grilled asparagus since it was tasty and well seasoned.   I would go back to give it another crack. This is a business where you can tell they have put their heart and soul into it, and the effort is there, it just needs to be executed better.   I'm going to put this down to a new local business trying to find its feet and hope it does just get better over time. Still reccomended and these guys seem to be winning awards all over the place at the moment.   They also accept referrals for underprivileged families to come and dine in the restaurant so despite my meal experience, they have my total respect for their sense of community and social justice.",

As a flight attendant who travels all around the world, I can honestly say this was one of the best meals I have ever had. They ask if you have any food allergies (which is a nice touch) and then bring out an amuse bouche which includes the scottish national dish haggis but it's deep fried and delicious.  I had the seared scallops as an appetizer and the salmon over sword fish risotto and a vanilla beurre blanc. Melts in your mouth! They deal predominantly in seafood but there were other options available. Make reservations as it only seats 27 at a time - well worth it! Make an effort to try this place, David and Andrew were especially nice. I look forward to visiting again.",

Came here with some fellow Yelpers in their soft opening period, prior to the formal launch. We had a taster menu of 3 courses and amuse bouche. As the gluten free one, I received my own little selection which was appreciated.  My starter was a terrine which was tasty but for me, my stellar, stand out dish was the pork belly. This was cooked to absolute perfection, with melt in the mouth pork belly and crispy, crunchy crackling which was to die for. One of the elements of this dish was black pudding which was swapped out. My version came with apples, gravy and potatoes which was all just fab together.  Dessert was a platter with chocolate pots, jelly and I got some fruit too (my gf-ness) and all were great.  Wine - decent options and cheap too! Service was attentive and friendly. Being picky I thought my plate for the main was too big (plate size, not portion) as I thought it didn't do the dish justice. I'll definitely go back to try more from the menu as the options look so tempting!",

The gluten-free diner at our table was graciously accommodated.  I had the brie rumbledethumps to start (disappointing despite the awesome name), followed by the gnocchi as a main (delicious).

    "text": "I'd wandered past Kilted Lobster the past weekend and was surprised to see a new restaurant opening along the quieter end of st stephen street.  i probably would have completely forgotten about the place to be honest but when it was a suggested dinner venue for the book club i was happy enough to go along.  now, it's hard to give the most accurate review as we dined on a set menu and they have just launched their a la carte menu today.  i think the set menu was more as a trial of different dishes for the first week they were open as i note that there are the same dishes on their a la carte menu with just slight variations.  however the set menu was incredibly good value- 14.95 for three courses and a platter of amuse bouche to start off with.  i should also note that their wine menu is superb value, with the majority of the larger glasses being either just above or below the 4 mark.  the amuse bouche was brought to us shortly after we ordered and was quite nice.  it was three different bites- goats cheese with tomato/pepper salsa (i think) on ciabatta, ham hock and chicken liver pate on oatcake with rosemary, and smoked makerel pate on a cucumber slice.  they weren't overly imaginative but a nice little treat to start the meal.  my starter was the brie rumbledethup which i would describe as a cross between a bubble and squeak or a croquette.  it was ok and i was a bit disappointed that the brie was all in the centre instead of mixed throughout.  it was served on a tree trunk section which i found super odd and would have really preferred a plate.  main course was pistachio crusted roast coley with a smoked haddock croquette, broccoli, and lemon cream sauce.  i found this more enjoyable than the starter especially as the fish was cooked really well (compared to a filet of coley i'd had somewhere else last week) and the croquette was super tasty!  i'd actually recommend that they make that a starter option over the rumbledethup.  dessert was a platter to be shared between us which was just ok- prosecco and strawberry jelly, chocolate mousse, and a cheesecake square.  i'm not a massive jelly fan and found the other two options just ok really.  the chocolate mousse was probably the nicest but it was served in a fancy glass that narrowed at the bottom so you couldn't get your spoon all the way down to finish it off.  i've rather mixed feelings on the Kilted Lobster as there were some really nice parts of the meal.  i ended up paying 20 for three courses, a large glass of wine, and tip so definitely value friendly although that may change with their a la carte menu.  the service was good although there was only one girl waiting tables so could imagine that may be a struggle if it got busy.  i feel like they could be onto a good thing here and would definitely head back to try the a la carte menu to see if i could up my rating.  *and just as a side note to all those health and safety minded people- the landing with steps down to the toilets is incredibly tiny and if you happened to not be paying attention there's definitely a potential of falling down the stairs!  i'd advise they put up a wee sign warning people just to avoid any accidents :)",
