    "text": "If you're looking for something \"a little special\" while visiting Edinburgh Castle, checking out the tea rooms for afternoon tea isn't a bad idea!  While frankly quite overpriced (24 for high tea), it does come with a pleasingly overindulgent tower of sandwiches, scones, and pastries. To be honest my main wish was that there was more tea, as I felt like I had to ration a bit to make it through all the food.   The cafe was nice, with gorgeous views out the window should you be lucky enough to be seated near them (they are quite small). The service was a little slow but not gratingly so.   See my pictures for an idea of the tower!",

    "text": "Had an awful experience here today. Stopped in with my son after a nice visit to the castle. Waited about ten minutes to be seated but that gave us time to look at all of the sweets. Once we were seated, someone took our order: tea for me, shortbread and juice for my son. After what seemed like an unnecessary amount of time for food and drinks that don't require any cooking, someone came to tell me they were out of the tea is asked for. I chose a substitute which had a slightly lower price than the one I'd chosen first. The tea and juice arrived but no shortbread. We waited and waited and no one brought it or came to ask us if we needed anything. We couldn't get anyone to come over to our table. By then we'd given up on the shortbread and just wanted to leave. Apparently we'd been forgotten. I had to ask the hostess to get our bill. When it came not only were we charged for the shortbread we never received, but my tea was still showing the upcharge. When my six year old son asked why they didn't bring his shortbread, he was told that they were busy and it was no one's fault. Really? Couldn't fulfill a simple order and \"no one's fault\"?!",

I enjoyed my Tea and scone. Seating is all interior. I got some shots of the sunroof room. Afternoon tea is served here too.",

    "text": "Set at the very top of the castle in the castle square, I found this little cafe the perfect spot to take a breather after working my way up the castle seeing the sights.  It's set in the Queen Anne building, hence the name.  It's rather small, with a normal dining room in the front followed by a second dining area in the back with a glass ceiling/skylight which definitely makes for a better dining experience.  Kitchen closes at 3, though sandwich items are available until 4.  Prices are a little high, but then again this cafe's business is all tourists so it works.  Order the special: half sandwich, soup, and crisps... seems to be the best deal.",

Definitely get in early as they pretty much only have the undesirable sandwiches left for you to pick on if you miss lunchtime.   However, the have pretty good desserts to choose from and that is what we did. The carrot cake was damn good as was the strawberry tart. So coffee or tea with a sweet while overlooking the city from up high was a nice finish after touring the castle.",
