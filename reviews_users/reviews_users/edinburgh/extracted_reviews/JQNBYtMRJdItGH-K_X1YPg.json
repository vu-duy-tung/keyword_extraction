Everything is clean and looks nice. Much better than Greggs across the road and i will go there for my lunch most days.",

Although slightly more expensive gram for gram, you get a much more homely roll or sandwich at Rudis, along with great friendly service. One in particular to try is the focaccia with basil, mayonnaise and parma ham - delicious! You get good thick bread and a unique range of flavours to choose from, freshly made every day. Overall it is an interesting and tasty alternative to the more commercial Greggs over the road.",
