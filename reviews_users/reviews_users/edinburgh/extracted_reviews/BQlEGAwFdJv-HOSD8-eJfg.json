    "text": "I stumbled across this gem while exploring central Edinburgh. The food is absolutely amazing. Truly authentic Greek dishes with plenty of menu options, along with daily specials.  The place is spotless, the pricing is quite good and the employees very friendly.   I've been eating here everyday since discovering it and plan to keep doing so until I head back home in a couple of weeks.",
