But yes, I must go back for some sweets when I am around! }:)",

For the price, the avocado toast just wasn't enough. - Two small pieces of sourdough bread and a thin layer of avocado. The poached eggs weren't the fluffy, bursting-yoke kind either. Sad face.  There's always a silver lining. - The matcha latte was lovely!",

It it the perfect place to take a break from everything with some coffee and cake, with a 'busy buzz' atmosphere and delicious food. I had a strawberry tart with a dark chocolate mocha, and mum had a mint slice and a latte, all of which we adored! I also liked how there is a option of white, milk, and dark hot chocolates and mochas which most other places do not offer! The staff were super friendly (and funny) and the prices are amazing for the quality of the food! This is definitely a charming little place that I would return to in no time!",

We were very hungry, and the sight of Croque Monsieur from our half torn menu looked extremely entising.   But.. when it arrived. What I saw, was not so Parisian, we got 1 whole see-through slice of ham. woopdidoo.   The cheese wasn't very awesome either, especially when you can see I.J Mellis next door. They should start getting a bit of their cheese from there! I felt like I was eating a new style of cheese wiz. That thing had weird texture.   Also, lets not get on the salad, it was a little bit disappointing with a few bits of iceburg lettuce.   Patisserie Florentin has a lot going for it, the location is great, the seating outside is way cool. However, change your menu! You have so much potential!!",

    "text": "Discovering a new place can be deceptive - the first time you've gone in, it's with a sense of expectation or mood that you're carrying.  So, for example, when I first came upon Patisserie Florentin, I was in a sad mood, and it's yellow walls, sunflowers, and wee back room with framed window facing onto a sun-filled walled garden was altogether a bit magical.  If going back knowing what to expect, however, it's altogether a different story - you have a reference point for disappointments that occur again, like the one member of staff who is so lovely and polite and with such a lovely smile that the others seem sullen, not just curt, in comparison.  You notice that the service isn't great on your second visit and remember that last time, it took quite some time to get your order taken, and more time to get the bill.  And you start to notice the other things that you either really do quite like - the pastries and bread in baskets on the wall and the overall French feel you do get from the cafe if not always from the food - and the things you aren't so keen on - the one or two members of staff who seem pre-occupied with anything but serving customers and the slightly-warmer-than-tepid coffee.  Still, Florentin does have atmosphere - maybe that's something that you bring with you, but at least a little of the welcoming sunflowers also rubs off.",

Although they still have some freshly made croissants and pain au chocolat on offer, I tried one of their panini's. I decided to break out of my Mediterranean eating habits and ordered a sweet Thai chicken filler. Not only was it really reasonably priced but it was also delicious! The tangy, gently spiced chicken was appetising without being too overloaded with sauce. It satisfied my hunger cravings without bloating my belly up.  I got mine to takeaway since it was quite full inside, but if you choose to sit in and arrive at the right time of day, it's a very mellow yellow environment. The walls are painted a gentle, creamy yellow, and its bespoke design and slightly bohemian feel is very appealing. You could almost believe you were in Montmatre!  The staff were friendly and I can happily report their sweets were delicious. Aside from doing healthy smoothies, they have a lovely selection of cakes. I had a macaroon swirl and not only was it a tasty sugar rush, but it also cleansed my palate. Tres Bien!",

Light and bright on the inside, baskets of pastries tempt you as enter, the Danish pastries in particular look very fresh and inviting. A variety of seating both to the rear and the front of the cafe, flanking the counter that housed a tempting range of chocolate covered treats, lemon covered pastries and macaroons to name but a few. Lots of people came in as we sat, just to get cakes to takeaway, clearly a popular destination. The staff were enthusiastic and friendly, and the whole place had a great ambience, shame we live so far away. The hot chocolate and peppermint tea we ordered were flavoursome and refreshing, helping to melt away the stresses of the day and the Rice Krispies cake topped with milk chocolate was a tasty snack to share. The also offer more substantial lunch dishes on the menu like Croque Monsieur and Club Sandwiches, which we definitely try next time we visit.",

So on our first visit, I got a ham and cheese toasted pannini while Mary got the goat cheese salad.  The pannini was fine (it's pretty hard to mess up a ham and cheese toastie), but the goat cheese salad was like a salad from McDonalds.  Chopped iceberg lettuce, onion, tomato and cucumber with the scraggiest looking goat cheese round you can imagine plonked on top.   While the service for us was fine on our first visit, watching other peoples experience, the staff seemed to be either overwhelmed or just useless.  People would come in, sit down and then be ignored or they had to ask where their food was (remember, these are just sandwiches and toasties etc... nothing complicated).  Maybe we were lucky.  The next time we attempted to visit we weren't so lucky.  We thought we would give it another chance and stop in and try their desserts and a cuppa.  On a Sunday afternoon, a few hours before closing time, the front room was full and there were two chairs partly blocking the back room.  On asking if we could sit back there, we were curtly told \"Cut off, only these!\", pointing to the tables in the front room.   Well, Madam Cliche, you're a perfect example why places like Costa and Cafe Nero (where we ended up) thrive.",

The menu is pretty standard French cafe fare, and keenly priced. Today's soup was chicken and vegetable, served with 4 or 5 decent slices of fresh baguette. No one could accuse them of being stingy! However, the soup wasn't as hot as I would have liked, and the texture was a bit gloopy. Some of the vegetables had also been boiled beyond recognition. One was large, flat, green and chewy. It could have been green pepper, or cabbage, or seaweed, I couldn't for the life of me figure it out. It did fill me up and wasn't too expensive though.   There is a seating area out the back, as well as tables at the front and on the pavement. The bench seats at the front are quite uncomfortable, but if you are just stopping by for a quick snack or coffee they're ok.   Overall worth a visit if you are nearby, it certainly beats Costa and Nero for price, quality and atmosphere.",
