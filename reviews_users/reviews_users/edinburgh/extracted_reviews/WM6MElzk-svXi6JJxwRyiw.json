    "text": "Fifteen of us booked for a family pre wedding dinner including one vegan and two avoiding dairy and gluten. A Room in Leith didn't let us down. It is a cosy atmospheric bistro in a picturesque setting on the quay side in Leith. Staff were endlessly patient with us even when one of the party mistakenly took one of the other's plate with consequent confusion and a graciously provided replacement. As a larger group we ate from the party menu with dishes adjusted or replaced for the dietary requirements. At 23 for two and 27 for three courses the meal was good value for the quality on offer. I started with a locally smoked salmon and crayfish roulade which was served with a pungently garlicky aioli. The roast haunch of roe deer served with a venison haggis croquette was a popular choice. Served nicely pink it was perfectly cooked and delicious. Room for pudding? Say yes to gin and tonic sorbet with Scottish strawberries or carrot cake and whisky ice cream! There is an impressive range of craft beers and wine but they also welcome byob (4.50 corkage).",

Lovely place, food is excellent and the staff are just the right amount of attentive without being intrusive. Highly recommend, and I already want to go back...",
