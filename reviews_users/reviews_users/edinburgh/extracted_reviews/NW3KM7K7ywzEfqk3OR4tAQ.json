    "text": "This is a True little gem.  I am perhaps the world's greatest critics of Indian / Nepalese restaurants as I know what I like and they often don't live up to my standards.  I've got my favourite restaurants that I frequent and I do often try others but 99% of the time I leave disappointed.    I'm very happy to say that when I went to The Gurkha Cafe this was the other 1%.  I was anything but disappointed!!!    The interior of this place is really cool, it feels like you're in a little hut as it has open wooden beams all over the ceiling.  I felt as thought I'd taken a plane east by just stepping through the door.  The interior really does set the tone and makes a lovely change from other restaurants in Edinburgh.    I saw someone at the table next to me drinking a Nepalese Gurkha beer so I decided when in Rome...  It was not a bad beer and went well with the food but for 4.95 for 660mls it wasn't so cheap.  Worth it for the label though.    I went for the Mo Mo Cha Nepalese chicken dumplings to start and you could choose this either steamed or fried.  I went for steamed and was SO glad that I did as they were delicious.  I was a bit apprehensive but they were very tasty.  They were crescent moon shaped and there were lots of them - I'm sure I had at least 5 and was full after the starter alone as they certainly didn't scrimp on the portion sizes!  What made this dish though was the sauce that accompanied it.  I couldn't work out what was in it and it didn't say on the menu but this was a tasty little number.  I want to say it was mustard as that's what it looked like but I hate the stuff so know it certainly wasn't that.  No matter what was in it, it was divine and just pushed this dish over the edge and into the exquisite category.    My companion had the chicken satay to start with.  This wasn't the usual Asian chicken satay that you'd normally expect as this was with a Nepalese twist.  The size of this dish could have easily passed for a main course!  There were huge chunks of chicken under a rich, tomato / barbeque style sauce.  As I said, not like the usual peanut style satay but still good.  Not as good as my dumplings though - top tip!!!  :)  Another good thing about this place (to add to the huge list) is you can specify how mild or how hot you'd like your meal to be so the dishes really are made to your specific requirements.    For main course I ordered the chicken korma.  When ordering in fact, I asked the waiter what he recommended by telling him what I liked.  I know a lot of people think, 'boring old korma' but this restaurant gave this dish a new lease of life.  The tastes and flavours in this dish were phenomenal.  That's what I love about Nepalese even more than Indian restaurants, they use even more herbs and spices to create the perfect flavours.  Yummy!!!  Again the portion sizes were very generous but it was so tasty that I couldn't stop eating until I'd finished it all.    My fellow diner had the chicken garlic and chilli if I remember correctly.  It came out still cooking on a hot plate and the colours of the dish made for great presentation.  The quantity as well as quality of this dish was unbelievable, we could have easily shared this alone without starters and still left full I'm sure.  She only managed a quarter of it as it was!  As I said above, although this dish is made with chilli she asked for it to be mild and it suited her just perfectly.    We ordered rice and a peshwari nan to go with the main courses.  The nan was lovely, lighter than most nans which was a good thing considering the amount of food and it came in a basket cut into pizza style slices.    This place really does have it all - you can't get a more central location, the highest of quality food with flavours bursting in every mouthful, good friendly service and a different yet cool interior.  It's a winner!!!    As if you can't tell already, I love this place.  Take whatever I've written and imagine I love it 100% more then you'll be getting a bit closer to understanding how much I enjoyed this meal and now love this restaurant.  Honestly, the only thing left to say is try it for yourself.  I'm sure you won't be disappointed and if you are then you can always take the left overs away for me:)",

    "text": "Zoe and I have been searching for a really good Indian restaurant in Edinburgh, and I think we have finally found it.   The Gurkha Cafe serves Indian and Nepalese food, and is a cosy little restaurant just off the Royal Mile. The interior is like a brightly coloured Swiss chalet, with low exposed wooden logs, contrasting with bright painted walls.  To start, I ordered the interestingly names MoMo Cha, spiced chicken dumplings that can be ordered either fried, or steamed, and I opted for fried. Zoe had the Tandoori Chicken. My MoMo Cha came with a sort of curry mayonnaise dip, which was perfect for the crisp, crunchy little pastry packets of spicy chicken inside. These were plenty spicy, and offered a very interesting alternative to the usual Indian starters. I will definitely try them steamed next to to see how the texture compares.   Zoe's Tandoori Chicken was served with a trio of dips, tamarind, chili, and spicy coriander. The chicken was melt-in-the-mouth, and was perfectly spiced. This was a perfect example of how to do Tandoori, and it was a very generous helping too!  For mains, I had the Bhuteko Khasi, described on the menu as tender lamb cooked with green chili, garlic and spring onion in thick sauce; Zoe opted for Pudini Chicken: chicken marinated in mint cooked with herbs spices and green peppers. The lamb was incredibly tender, and had clearly been slow cooked long enough for the meat to break down nicely. The sauce was thick and rich, and plenty of spice to satisfy my craving for heat.  Zoe's chicken was also beautifully succulent, and was unlike any curry either of us have ever tasted because of the strong mint flavour, which was incredibly refreshing for a curry! We shared a garlic Naan and pilau rice.  The naan was perfectly cooked, and super tasty with loads of garlicky flavour, and was nice and crisp underneath. The rice was nice too.  The portions here are so generous, two people could probably share a main, unless you are super hungry.  I would say two curries between three people would be the perfect amount. The waiter was very friendly and informative about the menu, and we felt very welcome.  There's no doubt the standard of food here is high, and we will certainly be going again soon. Highly recommended, and a very welcome addition to the curry scene in Edinburgh.",

    "text": "All too often I find myself in a predicament. If I am to wander into a coffee shop and catch sight of carrot cake on the counter then I simply can't have anything but carrot cake. This is both a wonderful and terrible affliction; all other delightful options are off the table but, of course, I am presented with one of my most favourite things in the world. And so, naturally, I judge a cafe on the quality of it's finest slice. If you can serve me up some delectable carrot cake, you have my affections.  The korma, for me, is the carrot cake of Indian cuisine; whilst I'll have a browse of the menu, tell myself that today will be the day for a new dish and even deliberate over various mouth-watering options, my decision is already made and I am no less satisfied with a plateful of creamy korma curry goodness. So when my friend chose Gurkha for her birthday dinner, you can bet there was just one dish on my mind.  A table of 18 is quite the feat for any restaurant and Gurkha's service was exceptional from start to finish. We were difficult; unsure of when the rest of the guests would arrive and when it it came to ordering, there was constant changing of orders, and the number of side portions of rice and naan was forever fluctuating. Basically, we were a restaurant's nightmare but the Gurhka staff couldn't have been more professional. It was a wonder that they got our orders completely right considering how chaotic we were, but the staff were attentive and this really showed.  If you can resist the Indian delight that is the mango lassi, then I commend you. I ordered one and was presented with a wonderfully scrumptious glass of thick mango yoghurt heaven. Saving some for the meal was impossible and I slurped it down in an instant. It;s safe to say that the Gurkha has perfected the mango lassi and I want another and another and another. The korma...Well, that was a heaven-sent bowl of creamy warming goodness and I could have licked the plate clean. With deliciously tender-cooked chicken, accompanied with rice and full-of-flavour garlic naan, it made for quite the Indian feast.  I now know where to go in Edinburgh when craving authentic Indian and Nepalese food. And of course; incredible Korma.",

The wait staff could use a bit more training or care a bit more about their job.  We sat next to a table where a German couple had just finished their food and the waiter asked if they wanted dessert.  When they asked what was available the waiter stared at them like they had 3 heads--and 3 feet away from us were a slew of dessert menus that he didn't even bother to bring to them.  Very odd service.  If you can get over the indifference of the wait staff the food is worth it.",

I assess quality of any restaurant with the type of Nan/Roti they serve and this one had some of the best ones. Fresh and tasty to eat.   The food quantity was sufficient and had the right spices.   The only reason they almost lost the fifth star was time of service as they are pretty slow. The explanation provided to me was that they start cooking the food after one orders.

    "text": "Another testament to the power of Yelp was in our trip to Gurkha Cafe & Restaurant. Looking for a place to eat a hearty curry or similar in a certain area of Edinburgh, we took to the app to find this place near the top with many favourable reviews - and I can see why. We absolutely loved our meal here, and will be back should we find ourselves hungry for Nepalese or Indian in Edinburgh again!  I looked at available tables on the app, but found they weren't taking reservations for any earlier than 2 hours time. Starving, but desperate to try this great-sounding place, we decided to head there anyway and see if they could squeeze us in. We weren't a terribly long walk from Cockburn Street, which is a great location for such a restaurant - and we managed to just beat the rush for an early dinner. We had bright surroundings, almost terracotta walls and various (Nepalese tourist board approved!) pictures hung depicting scenes from Nepal and beyond. The panpipes and other calming music, coupled with the bright setting, made a welcome change to the often bland curry houses you can find up and down the country.  Friendly waiting staff quickly supplied us with the necessary appetisers; popadoms, naturally, with a pickle selection. There was a garlicky, tomatoey, almost salsa-esque dip which was just divine; I could have eaten it all day! But I had by this point ordered a delicious sounding Nepalese-style lamb curry. I cannot remember the name (bottom left of the menu!) but it promised tender meat, chilli, garlic, and \"Nepalese spices\" - whatever they might be. I don't much mind what they were, really, because it was absolutely delicious. One of the best curries I've ever had in my life, it was full of flavour, with every piece of garlic and chilli adding to a buttery richness in my very happy mouth. I ate the lot (rare for such a large dish!) and mopped up the sauce with my huge, fresh naan.  We were way too stuffed and happy to contemplate dessert, but I'm sure they would have been just as good. Great value too, as with beer and mains (plus popadoms of course) we only paid around 50 for the two of us.   Worth every penny, and then some!",

    "text": "We ate here last night because of yelp recommendations for my friends birthday, and we were not disappointed!  The vegetarian options for myself were interesting, with different takes on Nepalese and Indian staples. I've spent 3 months in Nepal and tasted all the wonderful curries out there, so I was even more impressed to find these curries not only compared to the real thing but some were even better! I tried the dishes of everyone around me and wow the flavours were perfection and they even tweaked my dal, making it even spicer for me and I can honestly say it is the best dal curry I have ever tasted!  The mango lassi was bang on, perfect with a hot curry, and the karma sutra drink was dangerously yummy.  I had popped into the restaurant earlier in the day with a cake and candles for our friend, at the end of our meal the staff dimmed the lights, put on a birthday song and even made a lovely display saying \"Happy Birthday Suzie\" on the plate carrying the cake and out the candles on exactly as I had asked.  I really can't rate the food, drinks and staff at Gurkha highly enough, I'll definitely be returning next time I'm in Edinburgh!",

The service  was however quite poor.  There are actually no pickles in the pickle dish, when asked for some they did respond but it took way too long, my popodums were already history. The garlic nan bread was freshly cooked looked great but was under cooked leaving a dooey center.  When I ordered a beer it took a long time to come so I went to the bar and asked what was up. It turned out they were changing the barrel. No problem I said I'll take a bottled beer instead so I can have it with my meal ( or what was left of it).  This created chaos. Oh no you must have your ordered beer....will it come in time before I finish my meal?.....they exchanged it for a bottle of tiger (no apology).  But the food was good so 3 stars.",

    "text": "Finally a restaurant in Edinburgh that lived up to it's yelp ratings. Very good Indian food. We ordered chicken tikka as starter. Very well spiced and succulent pieces perfectly grilled chicken. The accompanying chutneys were just the right amount spice and tanginess. For the main course we ordered dal makhani, paneer kadhai, garlic naan, and mix veg rice.   First the naan, perfectly baked with just the right amount of garlic to lightly flavor and not overpower you. Lightly buttered just what was expected.   Paneer kadhai was very we cooked, nice spices. Only caution is that it was made with a lot of oil. I may not order it again just for that reason.   Dal makhani, what shall I say, it was perfect, just I remember from restaurants in Delhi, very authentic. Just amazing.   Ve rice, had a good combination of vegetables and lightly spiced with cumin and thyme. The flavor just took me back home to my mothers cooking!  To top all of this, the service was excellent. One of my gripes with Indian restaurants is that they do not give finger bowls outside India. They gave wet towels, wonder why other Indian restaurants don't do this. Simple but effective.   Full hearted recommendation for Indian food in Edinburgh to Gurkha!",

    "text": "First and foremost the restaurant is set in a cozy street called Cockburn a 5 min walk from princess street, old town. It has low hit like ceiling with wooden beams and planks. So it does have that old world appeal. The service is kinda quick and it's a little noises in there, but I like that. Cuz quiet places are simply awkward. It's a very social place.   For starters we ordered Chicken momo which were nice but seemed like they were steamed and sat around for 5 mins too long. The chicken could've been softer but overall definitely recommended.   King Prawns for a starter are an absolute let down. Because it's one of the most expensive starters. It costs 8 pounds sterling, that's British pounds ladies; and that's over $$$$10 of those almighty United States Dollars. Just imagine you can buy a dress or eat this appetizer? :D I did ask them and they said its at their competitors in town are doing. But for me any business or establishment has to set itself apart by doing things differently and not repeating the same stuff.   Now that we have opened a can of worms, let's get to the guts, the meat of the critique. If you're ordering a meat dish then you expect a lot more than a couple of cubes of meat. We had a lamb, which was finger licking good. But the lamb vs sauce, I think we know that the sauce won that fight. It was way more sauce than you'd like, especially cuz you wanna taste the texture of the meat. Instead of being overpowered by the flavors of the sauce. It was still delicious and FRESH though. That's the most important thing. The paneer saag was wonderful and held its own next to the lamb & and tandoori chicken was moist and soft and came with a bit of sauce. We also got a cucumber raita that helped cool things down. And a salad which was nice next to high powered he at creamy curries. And with very soft delicious garlic naan bread & vegetable rice to mix in afterwards, it was an overall pretty perfect meal.   But yeah stay away from ordering king prawn, def not worth the money! This was a 5 star review, but the king prawn simply isn't a good deal. Consumers wanna eat well whilst being smart about their purchase cuz that's an added feel good bonus. It's only 8 pounds but Indian and you know we invented the copper wire fighting over pennies. But then again I'm from the rich agricultural state of Punjab and we have the richest food. And when we make a lamb, and the lamb runs out before the sauce. It's considered an embarrassment. So that's Punjab 5 & Nepal 4 hehe!",

Popadoms were fresh and crunchy, chutneys delicious and the curries perfect. We had a lamb curry, two chicken curries and one veg curry and rice and naan. The bread was perfectly fresh and the meats were perfectly tender.  There was plenty of food. Too much for us really.  I would recommend this place to any curry fan.

The spices and combination were unique! Chicken with lentils (Nepalese) and Lamb with spinach are not to be missed and definitely get the cucumber yogurt to go along with the bread.

I recommend this place to all of my coworkers and Edinburgh visitors. Besides the wonderful Indian standard dishes they also offer several Nepalese choices.  My favorites appetizers: Momo dumplings (a standard Nepali street food, I'm told).  Lamb Choila (fresh and spicy with a variety of flavors and textures). Nepalese Achar (Potato salad also fresh and spicy).  You must try them all!  The main dishes I regularly order are Lamb Madras and Lamb Khutta. Both are superb and of course the spice level can be adjusted to your liking on all of the dishes. I have tried many of the other dishes, but these are my favorites. I've heard many people enjoying the butter chicken, tandoori chicken and biryanis.  I always leave feeling satisfied, and looking forward to my next visit. I love this place.",

For the price, the naan should have been twice as big. The mushroom dish, sold as a \"main dish\", was the size of starter dishes half their price in other Indian restaurants. At least it was tasty... The poppadoms were also very small, just two small cones. See photo. When we asked for the bill, we waited for what felt like 10 minutes and it didn't come. We reminded the waiter about it and it still didn't come. It took asking the manager to finally get it. Overall, while we thought the food was on the tasty side of average, the small size isn't worth what they charge, and service left to be desired.",

My vegetable korma was NOT spicy at all even though I asked the waiter to note that I wanted it to be hot. He then gave me \"hot\" paste to add to my curry but it did not alter the spice level whatsoever, basically pointless to add.   The garlic naan portion was so sad...a kid could've eaten it all and it still wouldn't be enough. I forgot how much it was but for the price, you would think that the portion would be greater...very disappointed in the flavor too. It could've used way more garlic and cilantro. There was hardly anything on it and looked almost like a classic naan (with no garlic). My boyfriend liked his curry (forgot the name but it was Nepalese) and it had lamb in it. The curry itself I tasted and it was OK...too much meat flavor to my liking. He send the lamb itself was tender but game-y (kind of expected).   Bottom line: I wouldn't recommend coming here as there were other Indian restaurants in the area that seem better. I regret coming here for my last meal while visiting Edinburgh...If I ever visit Edinburgh again, I will not be back.",

One is a big chunk of meat on bone and for me it had a strong after taste (not good for me). The other was like a stew of small pieces of lamb and that one was good.",

We thoroughly enjoyed the chef's secret blend of herbs and spices. It was tasty and impressive! The quality of the service was also noteworthy.

The food was overpriced for the portion size with nothing particularly standing out as good. 7 GBP for a mixed pakora appetizer which consisted of only 2 pieces of vegetable & 2 pieces of chicken pakoras, both of which tasted very average. For some reason, the waiter tried to upsell us to purchase a 3rd dish when my friend and I had each already ordered a dish each, which was quite odd...I'm sure some tourists have fallen for it in the past. You pretty much pay for everything...there is an extra charge for rice and to order a butter naan is an extra 1 GPB over the price of a naan as it was surprisingly an off menu item when our check came. Overall, this was an unremarkable meal which I expected to be a treat considering the great reviews. As a side note, this business does not take American Express for payment while every other business I visited in Edinburgh the same day gladly took it. I would have given this business 2 & 1/2 stars as the service was friendly, but must round down considering how very overrated it is.",

After being seated, the waitress informed us it was tapas style, but we decided to start off with just a curry each and a couple of orders of rice between three of us. It was the right decision as that ended up being more than enough food. Considering the amount of food we inhaled, the price was definitely decent. I had the veggie korma, which was a little thin, but overall very tasty. My friends got the chicken curry and tikha masala. Again not the best, but still incredibly good.

I wish I could go back but I don't know when I'll be in Edinburgh again :(",

    "text": "after wandering around the royal mile area, i decided to eschew pub food and try the Ghurkha Cafe instead. the food was very tasty, but certainly not worth the inflated price. ditto for the pint. i should have figured that prices would be high in this tourist trafficked area. aside from the price, the atmosphere was very nice, but the waitress was really pushing non-entrees on me, and was fairly dismissive when i didn't bite.",

    "text": "Having been to Gurkha Cafe a few times now I would definitely recommend it to anybody looking for a tasty, spicy meal. The menu is varied enough to suit most folk and the service has been great on every visit. The restaurant has a very relaxed atmosphere and is worth a visit either early on in the day or at night. The only problem was with the ventilation; your clothes really do smell like an Indian restaurant kitchen when you leave. But having said that, the food is so delicious you probably wont care all that much.",
