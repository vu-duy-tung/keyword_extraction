    "text": "Beautiful little tea shop in Edinburgh. Been here a few times & if any friends/family are visiting I am sure to bring them here... they are most impressed. LOADS of selection of teas - trust me you will have a hard time choosing. The descriptions are great too, which is unusual as most places leaves you to guess whatever the tea is by the name?! The only thing that slightly annoyed me was I visited once when it was full & they have no procedures to wait, so we just had to go else where which was a shame.. also there seems to be a lovely selections of cakes etc but the cupcakes looked suspiciously identical to the ones I saw the same day at Bibi's... priced about x2 as high, would be nice if they made their own too. The staff seem nice & tried a selection of treats with my friends... the sandwiches & nibbles were delicious!",

After seeing the sign that said please wait to be seated, we stood for about 5 minutes, being passed my numerous members of staff, before deciding the seat ourselves. And, that is pretty much how the service continued the whole time we were there. If we wanted something, we had to stop a waiter and ask, they never checked on us once. But, besides the horrible service, the food was pleasantly good.   We decided to each get the afternoon tea. I was concerned I wouldn't get enough to eat, but I was definitely wrong. We each were served a pot of tea, a full sandwich, a scone and various desserts. It cost about 9 a person, but for the amount of food we got, it was definitely worth it.   Unfortunately, due to the lack of service received here, I don't think I will be going back.",

    "text": "Me and my best friend LOVE tea. I drink at least 5 large mugs of the stuff a day. I'm not too adventurous but she is, she'll try anything. Additionally, we both love cake. We decided to try Eteaket a couple of Fridays ago while her dog was being groomed in the New Town because it seemed like just the place for us.   After arranging it on the phone together, I decided to double check online which street it was on and ended up here reading the reviews. I was a little put out but with the owner's response I figured I could safely ignore the previous reviews and it would be fine. I felt confident, Eteaket would be lovely.   It was to a point. It served tea. But not well. It had nice decor.   We entered just after 9.30am. At the time, we were the only customers except a couple who were already seated and eating, and a woman who was being served at the counter to takeway. We stood at the \"Please wait here to be seated\" sign which seemed a bit ridiculous at that time of the morning but hey, we didn't want to rock the boat. We were waiting patiently, chatting to each other, when two menus were thrust at us from the other side of the counter and we were told to sit down. Firstly, surely this defeats the point of the sign? Put the menus on the table and let everyone seat themselves? Secondly, she was in the middle of serving someone else and felt it was fine to turn away without apology to thrust menus at other people. This to me was a little rude.   Anyway, we chose a table in the front section in view of the counter (the reason I point this out will become apparent later). We had a look at the menu and tried to decide what to have. We decided, however it took a good ten minutes for our flame haired waitress to approach and ask what we'd like. I ordered a ham and cheese toast croissant and a pot of \"Awesome Assam\". My friend had toasted fruit loaf and an Earl Grey latte. We'd never heard of an Earl Grey latte before so my friend enquired as to what it was. It was explained in plenty of detail but with a tone that suggested we were being a little annoying and a bit of an inconvenience (Bear in mind, we're the ONLY customers to be dealt with). Our waitress really didn't seem to be interested in helping.   The order came reasonably quickly. My ham and cheese croissant was more squashed and scorched than toasted. It had clearly been placed on one of those panini type contact grills and flattened. The air and lightness of the croissant had completely gone. Disappointing. I had no opportunity to say anything because no-one came to ask if everything was alright. My tea came in a pot with a lovely bone china cup and saucer to accompany it (half a star) As it was leaf tea (as it should be), I was provided with a strainer through which to pour my tea. However, I was provided with nowhere to place the strainer once it was full of wet tea leaves so I had to rest it on the table to create a lovely pool of strong cold tea. Delightful.   My friend's toasted fruit loaf came in lovely thick slices (half a star, thus the first star is earned). Her Earl Grey latte was a new experience which was enjoyed, if not one that would be repeated often.   We finished everything and I suggested having some cake. Around 5 minutes of so passed and I decided to go to the toilet and peruse the cakes on my way back. The toilets were of an adequate standard, nothing spectacular, but certainly clean (hence the second star is earned). On my return a few minutes later, I had decided I fancied the look of the Coffee and Walnut cake. I returned to the table (almost 10 minutes after we'd finished eating and drinking) to find everything was still on the table. At this point, there were still no other customers.   A group of three ladies then came in and had a similar welcome to that we'd received, where menus were thrust from across the counter and they were told to seat themselves, again rendering the sign at the front redundant. They sat at a table just next to us.   My friend and I continued to chat away about various things, another 10 minutes passed and we still had not had our table cleared. The ladies next to us, had not had their order taken.   Another 10 minutes passed, their order was taken, which required the waitress to squeeze herself between my seat and that of one of the other ladies. Our table was not cleared. We were now at the point, having made eye contact with the waitress a few times, and me frequently looking over to the counter, we were determined, we should not have to approach her. We had finished a full half hour previously and had not had any more service.   A further ten minutes passed, I had given up all hope of the coffee and walnut cake, we stood up, put on our jackets, lingered near the door and yet still, no-one approached us. We approached the counter and found another waitress we had previously not encountered. She asked if she could help as if she had never laid eyes on us despite us sitting at the same table",

It's a really interesting take on the modern tea house, and I like it. There is a nice contrast with the old china tea cups and sauces and the cake stands that afternoon tea is served on.   I found the staff to be really friendly and very knowledgeable about the tea. Which is really important because they have such a big selection.   The food, from what I've tasted is very good. Paninis are as you'd expect a good panini to be and the carrot cake is superb.   Eteaket is also not a bad place to pick up a good coffee too.   All in all, well worth a visit.",

    "text": "I love it! Something different at last!   For too long, coffee houses such as Starbucks and Costa have held the monopoly and it is nice to have something new and different. Yes, this place does coffee, however, as the name suggests, their specialty is tea.   And they don't half do tea! I lost track of the different types of tea that they have, but they have something for everyone. Every one of their teas has been sourced from tea plantations visited by the owners and has resulted in individual and exciting blends, as well as the obligatory simple, uncomplicated green and black teas for the people who want just a simple cup of good tea. The staff are more than happy to offer advice and assisstance on a suitable tea for you depending on how you feel, what kind of mood you are in etc, which demonstrates their clear knowledge of their teas and the various health benefits of tea.   I love what this place is trying to do. They are trying to show that tea can be more than just a tea bag, and the way they have done this is very clever. They have based their ideas on the traditional, but pulled it right into the 21st century. From the decor - which is bright, clean and modern but with a traditional twist, such as the doily stencil which is a modern twist on a teatime classic, or the traditional styled wall lights that have also been given a modern facelift - to the china used to serve your tea and cakes. It too is mix of the tradition and the modern - classic tea cups and saucers which invariably never match (but that's half the fun!) to the sleek modern bodum tea pots in which your individual tea is served.   Which leads on to the food and drink itself. As mentioned, the selection of tea is unrivalled. But I also liked the selection of sandwiches which I thought were interesting and different. They also offer panninis and soups etc for the lunchtime visitors. And then there are the cakes. They have a great selection of tempting treats to suit everyone, from the scrummy millionaires shortbread to the most tasty flapjack you will ever have. And I haven't even started on the cream and afternoon teas! Beautifully presented on the same traditional china and cake stands, with lovely individual pots of jam, butter and cream!   Love what this place has brought to Edinburgh - a lovely retreat in the city centre.  Will continue to keep working my way through the different teas and cakes - I think I might be there a while!",

    "text": "I'm glad other people have had less-than-good experiences with Eteaket. I'd never been before but it was my birthday (a big birthday), and I fancied going for afternoon tea somewhere cool with a bunch of mates. Since we all work, it would have to be a Saturday, so I called up to make a booking.   I was told that they don't take bookings on weekends. This may be because they are always crazily busy (the main reason I have never gone in before -- every time I've fancied it, the place as been packed), so they don't need to... but I was really disappointed. The woman on the phone asked about the size of my group (8 people -- and at 12 a head for afternoon tea we'd have spent a hell of a lot in their establishment), and then basically told me that we didn't stand a chance. \"It's first come first served\" was the message I was given. However, she then suggested we make the trip anyway, \"just in case\"!! Come on -- you either want my business, or you don't!   My advice? Pay the wee bit extra and have afternoon tea somewhere where the establishment takes a wee bit more care over customer's needs. The Balmoral, for example, do fabulous afternoon tea, are always happy to take bookings regardless of the day and would never say something like \"it's first come first served\" to a customer. I think Eteaket just blew any chances they had with this tea lover.",

I'd not noticed this pretty little place before, but it's good to know now that it's there in such a great central location. As you would expect, heaps of different teas available here and beautifully served in the china cup and saucer sets. I learned masses about tea and also got exposed to ones that really didn't tickle my tackle - one green tea that tasted like a savoury broth  burrr! I'm more a black tea person myself, although the excellent chilli roiboos delighted my palette too. I tried the scones with jam and cream, the natural spouse of a good cuppa, and they were pretty tasty. This is somewhere I'll definitely endeavour to go back to. Thanks for putting on such a great event, Eteaket!",

Decor subtle, china cups a very pleasant reminder of days past. Amazed just how good the tea tasted out of the beautiful crockery. Scones and cakes again a reminder of home baking of days gone by.  The only fault or downside we found was the prices. These did not include VAT until you received your bill. Felt this was a bit cheeky. Obviously VAT has to be added and we would have paid anyway so please consider adding the VAt to menu prices. Honestly will pay anyway as a delightful delightful experience.",

I'm so boring when it comes to tea, as it's such a staple in my daily routine, so my palate has been used to a trusty cup of Earl Grey or English Breakfast for as long as I can remember. So far, despite the hugely extensive list of exciting teas on offer, and what's obviously more than just an ordinary specialism in different tea varieties, I've managed to be as big a tea bore as ever during my visits here. Not that opting for a chai tea is a dull thing to do, it's just that it's not exactly living dangerously either. I encourage you not to be like me, and to choose a kind of tea you wouldn't normally drink, when in Rome and all that jazz, you get me? There are a lot of tasty looking cup cakes and scone options floating about too, which I've not yet succumbed to, but no doubt I will, plus some pretty tea merchandise dotted around. The savoury food menu is pretty delicious too, with the classic croque monsieur always going down an absolute treat.",

With bright blue and pink decor, a range of tables and comfy couches, the interior looks divine, if perhaps a little intimidating for the macho male. Eteaket crosses the boundary between common cafe and high-tea hotel venues  it is not snobby or expensive, but you are greeted at the door and shown to a table, which instantly turns a casual cuppa into a delightful afternoon outing. There are two pages of tea to choose from (black, green, white, fruit/herbal, red/rooibos  they're all there), and a delicious array of scones, breads, and other bakery items, so there is sure to be something to tempt your taste buds. Your tea will be served in delightfully mis-matched pots and antiquey looking china cups and saucers, with a timer so you know its brewed right. Our table of four all received our teas and treats at the same time. The service here is impeccable, the decor delightful and the ambience awesome. This is a great place for an afternoon outing with the girls, or to take refuge from the weather/shopping. The scones are popular though, so make sure you order quick if you don't want to miss out.",

Cringe!   We thought the combination of the food was good and we thought it was pretty good value if done well, however 1. The sandwiches were made with bread that had been left out all day, so it was a bit krispy 2.

While I wasn't a fan of all of them I definitly could see myself becoming a regular tea drinker. The owners, who put on the night, really know their stuff and passion for tea was a bit catching. To top the night off we were given scones a little caddy of our favourite tea mine being chilli rooibos. During the day food is also served from what looks like a decent menu including breakfast, cakes and sandwiches. Will definitly being visiting again now that I've been converted.",

    "text": "Oh dear. It was so promising - a pretty place right in the middle of the city and just the venue for tea and cake, or so I thought. Sadly, it doesn't live up to the image it is trying to promote of itself as a quirky elegant salon de the type venue and, although fairly stylish (I emphasize fairly - it's not quite a nice as I'd imagined) it is definitely a case of style over substance. Service is not good - it took three waiting staff to fetch me one coffee and a cake; this included a lengthy wait at the counter to place my order (it was a quiet afternoon and there wasn't anyone standing in front of me - just several staff in a state of advanced disorganisation) plus a further ten minutes sitting tapping my toes before someone could get round to making my coffee. The food is a real letdown; if you're running a supposedly stylish city place like this, the food has to be top-notch and this completely missed the mark. I had expected to find a counter spilling over with beautiful home-baking (as in Glass & Thompson) and an array of interesting sandwiches made with quality fresh ingredients, with maybe some savoury tarts. Unfortunately the choice was poor, the shelves looked half bare and there was no sense of abundance, rather of a couple of pieces of this and that bought in and left sitting in a glass cabinet all day. Sandwiches and scones looked dry and uninspiring. My cake was actually pretty good but it was the one cake in the whole place that looked anywhere near tempting. This is really not good enough in a city that boasts so many fabulous places to have coffee and cake. Do yourselves a favour and go to Loopy Lorna's in Morningside - that place puts Eteaket to shame, and really if you can't serve up a cup of coffee and some good home-baking with prompt and friendly service then, frankly, you should be ashamed.",

Having unapologetically run out of a few options, I settled for a tuna salad with lemon mayo, which sounds interesting but is not much more than what you might get at Tesco Express. A few spoonfuls of tuna slapped on squidgy brown bread (somehow soft with really burnt edges) and a lackluster mixed salad. Lots of salt and pepper needed. Scones were fine, tarts were uninspiring. I'd say.. find a tea spot that sources Eteaket tea and get your munches elsewhere!",

    "text": "I am not a Tea Jenny........ not at all. I am the complete opposite, I am a Coffee fiend through and through. And I am proud of it. My friend however, she likes a good tea. Being the lovely person I am decided we would go here, I would happily have cake and some form of sub-standard (no doubt) coffee. Or so I thought in my mind.  The selection of tea they have here is amazing, if fairly tiresome to read through! And I actually found myself 'ooohhhing' and 'aaahhing' at the sound of some of these TEAS!?!? What on earth.   So we ended up having between us, and earl grey and a chai tea latte, a piece of beetroot and chocolate cake and a cream scone. And they went down 'fine', my scone was lovely and light, as was the cake. But as my friend commented not as good as her own and she was right! My Chai Tea Latte was ok. I have had better, specifically at the Marks and Spencers Cafe of all places!?  But I still really liked this little tea room. The atmosphere, the decor, the mismatch totally adorable crockery. The actual food sounds pretty good too. My only main qualm with Eteaket is the price!? I was not particularly fond of paying 5.80 for a chai tea latte and a scone. That's a little bit too steep for me. Other than that it is a lovely place for a visit once in a while, and is very good for impressing the 'Tea Jenny' friend.",

    "text": "A departure from old-fashioned stuffy Victorian tearooms, this is a chic, modern tea house/cafe that is as fresh as their menu. Beyond the cuteness factor, their tea selection is vast and they have a decent selection of pastries. I understand they have a lunch menu, but I opted instead for a traditional tasting of tea and a scone. The fruit scone was home baked and tasted just alright - I suppose I was expecting something a little more delicious considering this is a place that serves traditional tea. On a positive note, the pot of tea ordered (strawberry and cream) was wonderful and I thought was properly served in a single pot with a strainer and a timer.  The pricing of the tea was very affordable, especially considering the atmosphere. In all, I was impressed and would go back again for lunch and to try a different baked good.",

    "text": "So it looks like I'm the odd-girl-out but honestly, past the tea, I wasn't impressed with the Afternoon Tea at all. I had the Peach tea, which was great but it all fell apart after that. The scone-which I always look forward to here in the UK as the ones in the States are awful-was like a dried hockey puck. I'm sure it was great when it came out of the oven the day or two before but when it made its way onto on my plate I was immediately disappointed.  I had the hummus sandwiches which would have been okay if it weren't for the very-low-hummus-to-very-high-bread ratio. When you add the scone (which I tried to eat with a massive slather of clotted cream & jam), the mini pastries and the sandwiches what you really get is a boatload of mediocre bread products and a teensy bit of everything else (clotted cream, jam, etc). I can bad-carb overload at so many other places in this city (pot of tea included) for less than 14.95 and no doubt have a better experience.   I will say, however, the Banoffee tart was AMAZING. Sadface for it being so tiny. :(  The ambiance is definitely cute and I think it must somehow affect how others see this place (based on their glowing reviews) or maybe I just had a bad experience. Either way my recommendation is to simply get a nice pot of tea and a Banoffee tart. Past that I'd say look elsewhere.",

    "text": "I do love a good tea shop but a lot of time, I just don't seem to have time to enjoy a tea shop as you are supposed to. Tea isn't like the high octane powered action of coffee where it's the fast food of the drinking world. Tea participates in a slower pace of life, or at least that's how it's marketed.   I found myself in Edinburgh this past weekend, and figured, it's time to take my foot off the accelerator and pop into Eteaket after a trip to the bank. After figuring out I could seat myself (it's table service), I sat and waited. Then I wondered if any waitresses were going to come into the dining area. Then I got a little fidgety and started listening in to the conversations around me. Finally a lady came around and took my order and I went back to waiting.   First to arrive was an Eteaket special - a chai latte. Chai is something I have rarely, but do enjoy some of the sweet n spice that a chai delivers. It's a much headier experience, and Eteaket does it well. My brunch consisted of a smoked salmon bagel with capers. Except when it appeared, there were no capers. Given that there were no waitresses in the dining area again, I had to get up to go find someone to request said errant berries. It was a pleasant meal, with a nice wee salad dressed in some delightfully sticky balsamic vinegar (everything tastes better with balsamic, I swear).   Overall, I think that's it. Everything was pleasant. If you are popping in for a 3 hour tea and chat session, Eteaket is probably perfect. But for me... I don't know, I just found it...nice. NIce food, nice tea, nice surroundings. But not memorable, nor amazing. To be honest, I found it all surface and no substance, pretty but when you get to the bare bones of it... and I just found it a little wanting for what I look for in a tea shop.",

Not necessarily somewhere you'd hang out all day drinking brews (the ladies who lunch might eventually drive you to get a pint)but ideal for an hour or two. No idea what time it closes but I doubt you could manage to go and make a night of it. Can't comment on the food but the bacon roll and cuppa deal at 2.40 struck me as a good deal.",

We both had tea and a scone, and whilst the tea was lovely (and there are LOTS of choices!), the scones were bad.  For a place that specialises in these kind of things, you'd think their scones and cake would be amazing,but sadly it was not to be.  They arrived cold for a start (am I alone in thinking scones should always be served warm?), and were clearly not freshly made that day.  Now, we all know scones really need to be eaten on the day they're made, they don't last well. I asked the waitress if she could warm them up, which she did happily,but unfortunately they were still dry and disappointing.  Not inedible, but not something I would get again. The clotted cream that came with it was nice enough but the jam, described as homemade, looked and tasted anything but.  I also ordered a slice of white chocolate and strawberry cake to take home to my boyfriend but alas, that too was dry and disappointing.    The place itself was nice, service was good and everything looked clean enough but I'm not sure I'd be back.",

For my friends 21st birthday we splashed out on the afternoon tea deal. For 10 you get an old fashioned cake stand with a layer of sandwiches of your choice, a layer of scones, and a layer of mini cakes and muffins. If you go for this option, be prepared to be VERY full!! With this deal you also, obviously, get a to choose one of the 45. teas on offer. From the regular breakfast tea to jasmine flowering tea they have everything here.   For 2  you can also byob if you fancy.. which we did. We took a bottle of champagne to surprise our friend and it just added to the glamour of the experience. Great afternoon out-highly recommended.",

I loved tea when I was young and was given a box of \"fancy\" ones when I was about 12. I had forgotten about that though and settled for the usual PG Tips or Tetley. Don't think I'll be going back to that now!!   The couple that run the shop are so passionate about tea you can't help but catch some of it and get excited as each new tea is poured or passed around for a sniff. I think we tried ten in all, made notes on our tasting sheets and savoured each new flavour. I learned all about how tea is grown, dried, brewed and poured. All of which was a complete revelation to me as I usually just steep the bag for a bit, bin it and add milk!   The layout, decor and feel of the place is lovely. Lots of things to see and buy but not too cluttered, beautiful cups (of which I'm assured I can pick a favourite if I become a regular!), great selection of teas obviously and a good food menu too which I hadn't expected.   I popped in the night after the Qype Event to pick up a festive tea for wandering about with and the service was great. Friendly, chatty staff and no waiting apart from brewing time.   There's a VIP tea club which I fully intend to join in the New Year and when you join you get a MAGIC TEA POT!! I think it's the most amazing tea related thing I've ever seen and can't wait to get mine and try out all my VIP teas! :o)   With many apologies for the late review of Eteaket (my fault, nothing to do with the experience) I think I can safely say I'll soon be a regular!   Oh! and the Lapsang Souchong I chose as my free tea caddy turns out to be my favourite when I was wee too (I checked with my mam!).",

So much so, that more and more of the upmarket George Street bars and cafes are starting to serve it on their menus.  It's tucked away in a basement plot on on the corner of Frederick Street and George Street, and at first glance it just looks like yet another slightly overpriced independent retailer catering for the New Townees. But once you step inside you realise that these people are genuinely passionate about all things tea-related, from the high wuality of their stock to the sheer range of it. I didn't know until I came here, for example, that there is such a thing as Blue Tea or Red Tea. White, Green and good old Black tea I knew about, but these guys really know their stuff.  Yes, so it's a bit on the pricey side. But you have to treat yourself every once in a while, and you could do it in much worse places than here.",

Never having been to Eteaket or to a tea tasting before I wasn't quite sure what to expect, and certainly didn't expect to enjoy it so much, both tasting tea and learning about it. Learning about how it's made and the correct way to drink it opened my mind to the world of tea, so much so I don't think I could go back to the regular way of making and drinking it.   The shop and the owners were very inviting and welcoming, with a lot of emphasis placed on customer satisfaction. We tasted all different types of tea, my favourite being the green teas, which wasn't much of a surprise considering green tea is my tea of choice. There were also some interesting black teas, and a chilli flavoured rooibos tea which was very flavoursome!   I'm definitely going to visit the shop again, as a regular customer. I quite fancy an afternoon tea there or even as a meeting place for a catch up with friends. They also sell a lot of tea related utensils, which I will definitely be purchasing now I know all about tea!   A very well organised event and I highly reccomend a visit to the shop.",

We couldn't find a seat, and when we did, it was right at the arse of the place which seemed dark and forgotten.  Kudos for the 'Grannies kitchen' feel, with lovely mismatched tea-cups and pots, and the tables were simply lovely. I was starting to warm to the place, and would definitely try to get a better seat the next time, outside would have been perfect, it was a rare lovely day!  I decided to go for the earl grey Green tea to be healthy, although I kind of wished I had went for my friends Oolong tea as soon as it came to the table! Why does healthy always have to be boring!?  It was lovely though, and I could have happily sat and drank tea all day long if it hadn't been so busy. We just had the one pot each then left, happy and full of yummy tea.  I will come back, probably when it's a bit less busy, and if it's a nice day definitely get a seat outside. Nothing better than a nice cuppa in the sun!",

It is a gorgeous blend of traditional afternoon tea delight and a more modern approach to taking ones tea. The cups are so cute and lovely and the cups are one of the most important parts in making my tea drinking a fulfilling experience.   The selection of teas available is mind boggling and they are all served loose and at the exact right temperature for the specific tea you have chosen. I am loving the blend of art and science involved in that! I am a particular fan of green tea and more often than not have a pot of \"Blooming Marvelous\" which tastes so girly and delicious! If I'm feeling a little bit crazy though I go for some \"Strawberries and Cream\" tea, yes it is as wonderful as it sounds!   The afternoon tea nearly makes me clap my hands together and squeal because it is so fantastic and is served on vintage cake stands! If you are as obsessed with tea as I am you HAVE to give this place a try. In fact why not go along to one of the evening tea tasting events held at Eteaket? Because you are not a dork like me? Ok suit yourself then.",

    "text": "I like it. Though I only had a pot of tea it was a wonderful pot of tea.   When I arrived (on a Tuesday 13:30) I was a little unsure where I was allowed to sit - as quite a few 'reserved' signs were up on tables. I got assigned a nice table beside the entrance.  I was supplied a menu with their food and their Teas listed (they do other drinks too of course, coffee, juices and the likes).   I asked the girl who handed  me the menu what she'd recommend for someone like me that drinks Earl Grey mostly, she was showing me their varieties of the different Earl Grey mixtures they carry. Then out of left field she recommended their Royal Darjeeling. I agreed to try that and was pleasantly surprised! It was brought out in a pot for one (4 Servings) with a 3 minute sand timer (yellow) and some milk.   After brew-time was finished I poured and drank. It was perfect! Not too hot or cold. It was delightful and I was actually quite taken by it.   This was a nice visit and although I paid 2.60 for a pot it was worth it.   I deducted a star as I found the overall atmosphere a bit chilled and not so efficient.  Difficult to pinpoint, but I noticed a few food & drink spills and drops when service took place.   I will visit again though!",

    "text": "Tasty mutant ninja scones!! If you don't read any further then just know this place has the biggest and yummiest I've ever tasted.  I've been lucky enough to live down the hill from this place for a few months when I visit Edinburgh for work. But I've had varying success with getting a table when people come to visit, as you can't book and it's always full to bursting!  My tried and tested tip now is to aim for the post-lunch/pre-teatime lull around 2.30pm, and smiling at the rushed-off-their-feet staff goes a long way. Yes you'll probably have to wait awkwardly by the till for a short while, but this weekend my sisters and I were soon seated in the peaceful back room (and ahead of another group that had been quite rude and lost patience - nice guys may finish last but they get their tea first here!).  You can't help but be charmed by the cutesy decor inside - all the furniture is either a yummy turquoise or bright pink, with artwork on the walls for sale. The crockery is all pleasingly mismatched too, and my colourfully spotted teapot - plus accompanying hourglass for optimal brewing time (eek!) - made me inordinately happy. What can I say, I love teatime!!  All 3 of us opted for the full afternoon tea, which set us up for the rest of the day. Cue a stand of generously stuffed sandwiches (go for the brie!), a mammoth scone each with jam and clotted cream, and 4 mini cakes/tarts each. EACH!! It was all delicious (esp the giant scone) though we ran out of steam on the final layer and our lovely waitress packed us the mini treats in a box to take away (which made one awesome midnight feast!).  There are other smaller cream tea options on the menu too (that in hindsight might've been easier to finish) and easily about 70-odd different brews to choose from - green, white, fruit, the works! So a great one to treat your tea-loving friends, and only docked a star as the service is a little flustered (i.e. on the slow/forgetful side). But bless them you can tell they're trying their best in the rush of being such a popular stop, and spending a bit longer here than necessary might be no bad thing...",

Maybe it had to do with feeling like I was in a chain.  Something about the colouring ... I don't know, in my head tea rooms should be a bit like pubs - warm, inviting, kind of funky.  Eteaket didn't really tick any of those boxes for me.  My tea (green Earl Gray) was quite nice, as was the box of creme caramel rooibos that I bought on the rave recommendation of Cressida F.  A bit pricey though - over a tenner for two pots of tea and a box to take away?  That's not too bank account friendly.  All in all it's nice, but doesn't quite give me the tingling feeling that I was hoping for.  Maybe next time I'll just opt to buy a box for home.",

I vowed never to return after my first experience but had a change of heart when a friend and I were looking for a cafe near by.   I came with my boyfriend the first time I visited. As we walked in I giggled at my boyfriend's choice as it's definitely a ladies place. It's cute. I think that's the best way to describe the decor. All pink and turquoise. We ordered tea, scones and half a sandwich each.  It took over 45 minutes to receive our tea - just the tea!! I don't even know why we stayed!! I think it was a combination of being in the middle of town on a Saturday and everywhere else being full. Still 45 minute for tea is cray cray.   The good: the tea is delicious and I love the choices that are available. It's the largest selection of tea that I have seen in Edinburgh.   The bad: Meh. Eteaket isn't really bad, per se. I hope that I've just had a really bad experience. I'll say that in my opinion the scones are nothing to rave about it.   The ugly: The service needs improvement.   I'm not rushing back.",

Eteaket hasn't changed at all, if anything it has slightly declined.  After being told it would just be 5 minutes for my table (turned out to be closer to 30), I then ordered my tea and scones.  China was chipped, which I guess is alright for some people, was just a bit worried that it would cut me.    Waitress couldn't offer me any advice, and actually couldn't even recommend me a tea without having to read through the menu herself.  She was quite friendly, just would have been nice to have experienced staff.  Any maybe this is where my next problem originates that it took forever for my food to arrive, and then longer for the bill.  I ended up spending over an hour and a half, when I was really just wanting a quick cup of tea and a scone.  Eteaket prizes itself on being one of the top tea shops in Edinburgh.  While this may have been True in the past, it felt to me that it is in dire need of a vacation as it looked a wee bit tired.",

    "text": "This is a nice wee tea shop.  I recently brought an Italian friend here for some good old afternoon tea. Strangely enough for Edinburgh, it was a beautifully sunny and warm day so we managed to get one of the outside tables. It's a very nice place to sit and watch the world go by.  The staff were friendly, efficient and explained about the little egg timers for brewing our tea when they brought our order.   I had Tutti Frutti which was delicious and actually tasted like fruit unlike most so-called 'fruit' teas! My friend asked me for a very British tea so I suggested Earl Grey and she really enjoyed it. Our fruit scones were delicious, fresh and massive. So massive that I wasn't able to finish mine which is very unlike me!  Tea rooms are very much a fashion in Edinburgh at the moment. This is a good one, but for me it didn't have that something special to make it stand out. Yes, I will go again if I'm in the area and in the mood for tea but somewhere like Anteaques will always be my preference. It just has that little bit more to offer, something that makes it stand out. And unfortunately Eteaket does not.",

    "text": "Eteaket needs to step up its game.  We headed here today after our first option was booked out. I had recommended it as a possibility for some visitors who were staying in the area and they were suitably impressed with the quaintness, the quirkiness and the Eteaket-ness of the place we've all grown to love over the past few years. But honestly, when I compare it now to three years ago Eteaket has fallen from grace a bit in my eyes. The food and tea is, of course, wonderful, as always but everything else seems lacking.  Firstly, one of the chairs at our table had soup spilled down the back. The soup had dried in and looked quite icky. No one sat in that chair, thankfully there was three of us so we had the luxury not to!  Secondly, have you ever had the situation where the filter on your dishwasher has bits of food stuck in it? Then when the dishwasher washes at a high temperature the bits of food become stuck to the delph and are caked on because of the high temperatures? We had this on one teapot and all three tea cups. One of our teacups was noticed immediately by the waitress and she took it back but the others were not. This is likely just an oversight by whoever was washing dishes but I was surprised.  Finally, the staff are run off their feet. Completely. We saw two dropped trays in the 2 hours we were there, one girl who may have been new but was clearly having difficulty with the pace and our plates were practically grabbed off our table when we finished....well nearly finished, one of us was still eating their scone!! These are not the kindly, laid back staff I'm used to here, who put me in mind of lazy tea over a book or some knitting.   The Saturday afternoon rush seems to leave the place in a bit of a state and I'm not sure there is space to accommodate enough staff to deal with the mess that's generated. Unfortunately Eteaket will now be off my list for weekend venues. I'll head somewhere a bit further from the beaten track from now on!",

It's brighter, more modern (but in a wholly kitschy way, fear not) and always busy, so it tends to get loud and lively. Still, if you're after a good cuppa and a catch-up with a friend, Eteaket will do just fine.   There's a very impressive tea list (I've tried simple herbal teas and a caramel creme rooibos, and they've all been outstanding) and a decent food menu - some sandwiches, lots of pastries and sweets and a proper afternoon tea option. I've tried a cupcake and some tomato soup (not together) and they were both good - not great, but good. I'd skip the food and focus on the tea - just what the doctor ordered for a rainy day.",

It was about 14 for each of us, but I was ridiculously full after it. For 14, you get a huge sandwich (cut into quarters), mini cakes, a huge scone and clotted cream  - my new favourite thing.  I had the ham & cheddar sandwich (absolutely delicious), and my friend had the mozzerella, pesto & sun-dried tomatoes. We could barely finish the mini cakes, we were so full by the end of it. I think we ended up going into food comas - don't know how or why we even attempted to eat so late, and then eat more after. And the pot of tea that I had (I don't remember the flavour, I came so long ago!) was magnificent.   I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to hang out and catch up with girlfriends - next to my friend and I was a group of women having a baby shower! And if you want a cutesy place to take your boyfriend on a date, this is it. But please don't force him to sit inside unless it's raining - you'd definitely emasculate him.

I had mine with the English classic cream tea,  (how's that for immigration integration) and the scone was delicious as well.

Already having found some very expensive options around the same area I found this business online and their mugs with infusers were half price than the others I had found. We went on a Sunday and right away had seating, it looked crowded but was fine once sitting down, and they have an amazing variety of teas, also herbal. My friend had the high tea which was also a good deal price-quality wise, and I had a teapot and the (amazing) vegan brownie. The staff was nice, even though it was busy they were easy to flag down and ask suggestions to. So then I purchased my mug. Regrettably after a weak the little handle for the infuser came loose, not a big deal but still I wanted an exchange. Because I was working during their business hours I decided to email them, they right away without any questions sent me another full mug by mail! Even though I really just needed the infuser part. It was amazing and so nice how they without hesitating mailed me a new one just like that! That's why I gladly give them 5 stars! My friend that came with me also is very happy to know this place and said she would take visitors there in the future. She loved the chocolate tea a lot :)",

It is situated on a side street just off George Street which according to all the locals is the new place to be for designer / pricey shops and the bars of the moment, etc.   After careful persual of the extensive tea offerings, I decided on the Chocolate tea which was divine, when I poured it the chocolate aroma was delicious and the taste was amazing! My friend was very jealous and had tea envy wishing she'd ordered the same! I had a croissant as a snack which came with butter and jam and my only suggestion would be that it should've been heated up. My friend had a brownie and really enjoyed that.

We had a great time! eteaket is located in Frederick Street, so its a short and easy walk from Edinburgh Castle (we know  we tried it!) As there were quite a few of us I had reserved in advance, and eteaket gave us a lovely welcome. We had a table marked reserved all waiting for us, and they even managed to arrange for a baby chair for us, perfect! eteaket is lovely; very modern in decor, very vintage in crockery. My cousins had come from the US and they just loved it. We ordered the afternoon tea, and were in awe at the large number of different types of tea on the menu. And the pastries and cakes were amazing! I've tried to attach a picture to the top of this page so you can see what the afternoon tea is like. And yup  it was as good as it looks!!",

Had afternoon tea in London and thought nothing else could compare, but I was wrong. I like the plain scones more than the fruit scones, but both of them are delicious. Another element of this tea shop that I enjoy are the cute little timers for brewing time. Very handy! Overall, if my vacation was longer, I would probably squeeze in one more trip. Thoroughly enjoyed my tea and scones.",

My husband had a really delicious lentil and coriander soup plus half sandwich and I opted for the eggs, tattle scone and smoked salmon platter.  Both were delicious. I had a very delightful golden oolong tea while he opted for their own breakfast blend. Both were served with timers to be steeped to the optimal time, which is much appreciated to avoid a bitter brew (and we didn't get at the fancy tea at the Colonnades).  We then chose a lemon cake for dessert which was well baked with just the right amount of sweet icing. Can't think of a thing that wasn't on point and the price was very reasonable.",

It's a super cute tea cafe with a massive list of assorted teas, which I really appreciate bc there are so many places that serve a standard selection, with maybe 2 house special blends.  This one has something like 50+? There is something for everyone here!  I just opted for tea and scone, and very much immersed on my own. The scone was massive, and came with jam and cream, but I didn't care much it since it wasnt warm or soft. There are several other things on the menu such as cakes and sandwiches.   In any case, this is a great place to sit down and recharge. It was 4.75 for my tea and scone, though you could get that plus and half sandwich and assorted pastries for 8.95.  A full afternoon tea is around 15, or a few extra quid if you want a champagne tea. It's also a nice place to get a souvenir or gift rather than the standard tea from other places.   Would come back!",

But the service is sometimes a bit hit and miss... not that it's unfriendly, but I have never felt a sense of \"Welcome to Eteaket... we LOVE tea, our tea is awesome, we're GLAD you're here, and you're going to love our tea and food and cafe.\"   The last time I visited it was almost as if they were surprised that I had shown up at 12pm. It felt as if I should've already known what to order without having looked at the menu. And it seemed as if it didn't matter whether or not I was there. Is this because they know they have one of the best teas in the city? I'm not sure. Or is it because the staff don't enjoy working there or don't care about their products? I'm not sure about that either. I had to remind them to give me a loyalty card (which, to be honest, isn't a problem unique to Eteaket).   My dream: one day I will return and enjoy their excellent tea, scrumptious cakes and feel like they are happy I'm there and happy to tell me all about their excellent products and which teas I might like.   Because Eteaket should be one of the best places to visit in one of the best cities to visit. 'Should' is the key word.",

As we arrived on a busy Saturday afternoon we had a wee bit of a wait for a table - but honestly the staff were so nice about it I couldn't feel mad. After a less-than-ten-minute wait we were seated and given our menus: a selection of sandwiches, cakes, and a list of teas longer than even the most comprehensive wine list at the fancies bistro you know! I opted for the high tea - a sandwich, scone, mini patisserie item and a pot of tea, all for under 9 seemed like good value to me (is that still good value or am I still running on London prices?).  The tea comes with 'quirky' mismatched cup and saucer and an egg timer to ensure you brew it for the correct amount of time. Honestly, in some places the twee-ness would be too much but Eteaket manages to pull it off. And I promise I wasn't just distracted by the fact that the scone was bigger than my face (I'm a fan of food I can compare favourably to my body parts!).  Really though, everything was delicious (if you must know, my sandwich was brie and cranberry - because I'd obviously not had enough brie over Christmas - and my tea was Royal Earl Grey - because I don't believe any choice but Earl Grey is the correct one). I will definitely be going back to Eteaket, but lets see if I can reserve a table in advance next time, eh?",

I came earlier to meet my friend for afternoon tea at 3 so got my choice of seats.  Window-side was a good choice albeit they could have done with a bit of dusting.  We both had a pot of tea with a slice of cake.  The selection of cakes was not much but we went ahead with a red velvet and lemon coconut.  Cakes were a bit less than mediocre and tea was just tea.  Darjeeling was standard quality and my friend chose not to finish his.   There was one tall fellow who was quite friendly with a cheery smile, wasn't overly serviceable but just the right touch.  The rest of staff seemed tired and gloom, they can take a few pointers from that guy :) Two stars because I didn't hate the place but I wouldn't voluntarily go again.  There are many more worthwhile places to go in Edinburgh for tea/coffee.  But then again if a friend persists in trying this place in the future, I could hesitatingly give it another go and try what others are raving about on the scones.  Their tea lattes seemed interesting too, so...mayybeee..just maybe again.  Not a winner though.",

Teas were all delicious!  Scone was less impressive. I've had many nicer scones in other places in Edinburgh, so probably won't have that again at Eteaket.

Their A4 menu has over two pages devoted to tea, tea, and more tea. I can't wait to come back another time when I can really take the opportunity to browse all of the teas on offer; Alisa R and I arrived shortly before closing time so we hurried on and ordered quickly.  I have only very recently discovered the chai latte so I ordered one of those, and we scuttled over to the counter to see what the cakes looked like. The cupcakes were on the little side, and being the greedy guts that I am, I was swayed by the huge blocks of millionaire's shortcake. Alisa went for the yummy-sounding chocolate and beet root cake, which wasn't pre-cut, but when the slice arrived it was super generous too!  I think the chai lattes I have had since discovering it have been the quick and easy versions made with powder or syrup, but that is not the Eteaket way. This one was, of course, made with Proper Tea, so it tasted thinner and less sweet, but more sophisticated.  My shortcake was very good; it was solid and held its form well, with rich chocolate and thick caramel. I did wish I had gone with Alisa's choice though because it was completely amazing when I tried a bit.  The staff were really sweet and friendly, and quick to serve, although we were the only people there so late in the day so I can't speak for busier times... Yet! But I'll be back!",

An added bonus comes in the form of the opportunity to buy packets of your favourite loose leaf tea when you leave.   But it's not just about the tea (yes I really said that) their cakes are lush. If they happen to have the pineapple and ginger sponge when you visit, I can't recommend that highly enough.   The whole place is utterly charming.

The scones, on the other hand, were terrible -- they had an odd consistency, like that of white bread, and had had way too much baking powder added, which made them bitter. For 5 pounds for a cream tea, we expected better.  The tea room itself also feels rather crowded and dark, since there aren't any windows in the back area.

Staff are friendly and I liked that the woman at the till, who may be the manager/owner, was aware of who was waiting so there'd be no table stealing/queue jumping :-)  So seduced I was, I even left with a new teapot, complete with in teapot strainer (just like in Eteaket) and a little box of chocolate abyss for the office. Bliss.",
