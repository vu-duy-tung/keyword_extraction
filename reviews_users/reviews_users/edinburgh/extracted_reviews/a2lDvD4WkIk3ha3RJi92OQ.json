The staff are friendly and knowledgeable and able to provide guidance to those who do not know what they want.  The food was some of the best I have had outside of a Greek families home.  That is just what the place is like, dinning with a family.  We had a sampling of dishes and all of them were delicious but the desserts where outstanding!  Next time we are in Edinburgh we will be coming here.",
