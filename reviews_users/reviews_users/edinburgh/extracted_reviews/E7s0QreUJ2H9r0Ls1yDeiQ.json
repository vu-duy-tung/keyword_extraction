My main was a plate of three kofta balls, which I was excited to see on the menu and consumed with enthusiasm. My only disappointment was there wasn't more kofta to eat! I ended the evening with orange vanilla cheesecake - a nice way to wrap up the meal.  Service: friendly and attentive at first, but by the the time the meal was over, I felt a little neglected. I had to flag someone for my check after sitting there for five minutes. Not a biggie, as the food was so good!",

The food looks and smells amazing when you see it being given to other customers, however, the menu just doesnt make anything sound appatising at all - in the end, one I had told the waiter several times I wasnt ready to order because nothing grabbed my attention, I went for some mushroon something or other, and , not suprisingly, I wasnt impressed. My vege friends love this polace, possibly because they feel like they have to - but I wasnt impressed.",

I've lost count of the amount of times my vegeterian friends have had to settle for the only one option on a menu they can eat, but in here they can have their pick!

It's a pleasure to eat in this location.   And the food? Well, equally as delicious. Every single person that I've eaten in here with has been a meat eater, and they've enjoyed their meal equally as much as I have. The menu is inventive and broad ranging, and I'll spend an eternity deliberating over what to eat as I'm not used to having such a selection (I'm lucky if I get even more than one vegetarian option in other restaurants). Whatever I choose, I'm still destined to be envious of what everybody else is eating though, as it ALL looks so good.   Of course, being vegetarianit's much cheaper than a 'normal' restaurant too. So go. Eat. Enjoy. And walk away with your wallet still feeling relatively comfortable and your stomach feeling even happier!",

The problem I have is that they do not vary their menu often enough. I think it has been the same for over a year now. It would be nice to add new things at least as specials, or re-do the menu for the seasons, or at least annually.

To be fair, David Bann has an excellent atmosphere in there. The servers are kind and the place is very beautiful. The prices are around 10-14 which is pretty cheap for a nice place so no complaints there. However, there were little to no options on the vegan front to begin with. And both dishes we got were bad to a point where when the server came to pick up our plates, they looked relatively full still. There are many other wonderful vegan places in Edinburgh. We went to the Caffeine Drip the next morning and had insanely good eats. Try other places first before giving David Bann a go.",

    "text": "I don't quite understand the reviews claiming that that they literally missed meat while they were in David Banns or that its fine for vegetarians but not for everyone else. Even before I was a vegetarian I didn't feel the need to eat meat breakfast, elevenses, lunch and dinner, or every day for that matter. That would be quite some dependence. I like other good groups, like dairy or carbohydrates. But if I went into a restaurant free of them, I think I could probably manage for one meal without getting too upset. I feel like because people notice it is veggie, for some reason they have a predisposition toward seeing this as the sole reason for its faults. So I think maybe people need to realise a vegetarian restaurant can be crap for reasons other than its lacking animal.  As its stands I don't think David Bann is crap (the restaurant, not the man, he might be crap for all I know). There are plenty of vegetarian restaurants I don't like regardless of being veggie, but I do like Bann. My first and only gripe really is that its a touch more expensive than Edinburgh average. Expect to pay around or just over 10 for a main course (and you're likely to have a starter and/or a dessert).   There's not a huge number of dishes on the menu, but that's because it's all fresher than fresh (and mostly organic). The last time I ate here I had udon noodles, in a red pepper sauce, with smoked tofu. It was lovely! Thus dispelling the myth that tofu does, and will always, taste like a mixture of paper and water.  I have to admit that I don't find the restaurant overly filling. However I've always had this problem with restaurants, even before I became a vegetarian. Some have eluded that the problem is that there doesn't appear to be any meat around (anywhere!) but a niggling feeling in the back of my mind tells me its because the portions are small.  In general David Bann is a great restaurant. It's good for vegetarians willing to spend a little extra for some fancier food, or just generally for those wanting to experiment with very flavorful organic produce.",

I crave vegetables constantly, but it's rare for me that each and every component of a meal is fresh organic produce... The hotel concierge recommended this place -- it's very attractive and modern, almost sexy, and the food is terrific.  I started with the Brioche with asparagus and shallots and a poached egg with hollandaise sauce.  Then I had Tortellini stuffed with mushrooms and cheese curds that came in a beetroot sauce.  Next I ordered the Souffle with spinach and beetroot and blue cheese with a side of olive and basil polenta and a side of tomato chutney.  I'm normally not a dessert person but since I was on vacation and felt like indulging I treated myself to the Rhubarb Pudding with ginger sauce and vanilla ice cream.  Shocked by the very welcome low price of the wine selection, we split two bottles of Viognier -- 12.50 each!  Because I was so intensely focused on satisfying my own appetite I have absolutely no idea what my dinner companion ate -- but the reviews afterward were all glowing, as, of course, were my own.   I'd love to eat here often... If only I didn't live on a different continent.",

    "text": "It would appear that I have celebrated all the major events in my life with a meal at David Banns, it seemed fitting therefore to make a return visit at the start of my 35th year!  David Bann manages to accomplish what a lot of restaurants struggle with by providing delicious, innovative and exciting veggie dishes. It breaks my heart to go to a restaurant and find the vegetarian options are limited to mushroom stroganoff, vegetable lasagne and tomato penne pasta (laziness is what it is!).    In my group were the hardiest of hardy meat eaters, and it was quite a sight to see them all struggling to choose from the menu!  Starters were gorgeous and perfect sized portions. I had a very tasty blue cheese tart and the ravioli in a tomato broth looked so yummy!  We 'Oooo'd and 'Aahhhh'd our way through the mains with clean plates left by all. I was happy as a clam (erm...a veggie clam!) with my Jerusalem artichoke, celeriac with puff pastry and, although my friend didn't manage to finish her portion of smoke tofu with ginger and tomato jasmine rice, we soon put that to rights and scoffed the rest of it between us!  To finish, chocolate souffles all round...a perfect end to a great meal!  There was, as always, a great wine list and the meal came in at around 32 each which is pretty good for 3 courses and wine! The restaurant itself is elegant, intimate and has a general buzz of happiness and contentment about it!  The only one thing lacking tonight was slightly inattentive service (hence my 4 stars) however, the place was packed to the rafters so will make allowances for that!  David Bann, save me a seat for my return visit...it definitely won't be long before I'm back again!",

    "text": "High end Vegetarian! What a treat!  I've paid two visits here, two years apart, and been delighted both times. Really tasty, beautifully presented food and plenty of choice (though as I'm not a fan of beetroot, I was slightly limited; the house tomato sauce also seemed to make more appearances that I would have thought was strictly necessary).  The two dishes I enjoyed most were an Asian-style smoked tofu stir fry on udon noodles on my first visit, and the mushroom ravioli starter on my second. Both were really delicious, with excellent, well-balanced flavours.   The ambience is relaxing and classy, though perhaps the view I had, into the kitchen, on my second visit, didn't fully take advantage of this!",

    "text": "I am very sad to write this review, honestly I am.  I've been looking forward to trying David Bann for months, especially after several Yelpers raved about it.  I'm a big meat eater but love a veggie option time and again and an entire restaurant dedicated to vegetarian cuisine- sounds good to me!  But man oh man, David Bann really let me down.  My office made a lunch reservation for 5 people and I was so excited to come and try out the food that everyone has been raving about.  First off, the waitress took us to a table for four, despite the reservation being for five. Then we sat and waited for fifteen minutes for a drink order.  My boss finally had to get up and ask if we could order.  Then she had to get up again and ask for a refill.  We didn't get to order any food until twenty minutes in, and then we waited 35 minutes for the food to come out!  If the place were busy I would understand, but there was only two other tables in.  When we finally asked about the food we were told that two of the dishes took a long time to prepare, but no one informed us of this when we ordered- we're in for lunch, we don't have the time to wait 35 minutes for food after waiting twenty to order a pitcher of water!  The food came out and I had serious order envy.  My colleague had a beetroot and blue cheese something that looked and tasted amazing.  My veggies and noodles were... underwhelming.  They lacked flavour and honestly I could have made it myself. But with only five main dishes on the menu I felt like i had very little options.    Basically the lunch was unpleasant.  My boss ended up having to get up five times to ask for things: refills, food, the bill.  And at 13 pounds for my dish I was very disappointed.  I've had better dishes at takeaways for so much cheaper.  And the service: I haven't had service that bad at a restaurant in a LONG time.  It was so bad I actually wrote in to the restaurant to complain, and I NEVER do that.  Seriously, NEVER.  I work in the industry and have a lot of patience, but our entire experience was ridiculous.  I've been looking forward to David Bunn for so long, but I won't be back.  Like I said, I've had so much better food at dozens of other places for much, much cheaper.",

Every restaurant we looked at had clearly marked vegetarian and vegan options, and all servers were knowledgeable about the provenance of the stock that made the soup and happy to accommodate us.  And that is apart from the plentiful Indian restaurants which have extensive vegetarian options.  So, exclusively vegetarian restaurants are not as important in Edinburgh as they might be elsewhere.  David Bann's menu is interesting and eclectic, and the food was pretty good, but I wasn't bowled over by my risotto or goat cheese and tomato tart.  My husband's mushroom strudel was better.",

    "text": "Good thing I booked a table for a group of 10 yelpers. Leaving David Bann this evening, I noticed that the place was jam packed, and on a Tuesday night! Surely this is a good sign? Unlike many other establishments in Edinburgh, there isn't much of a quirky atmosphere/theme going on... It's quite polished and clear cut.  Being vegetarian, and having been recently diagnosed with coeliacs,  I have been having quite a bit of trouble finding restaurants which cater for me, and don't let me feel like I am missing out. The staff here have reserved a few menus where they point out which items are gluten free, onion free, and garlic free.   I was surprised to see quite a few options available from me, even from the pudding menu! The chocolate souffle and whiskey pannacotta stood out in particular.I was debating whether to get a starter and a pudding, or just a maincourse, though in the end settled for the latter. Tanja J's ravioli in a tomato and basil soup looked amazing, though the thai broccoli and tofu fritters which most people on the table looked a little dry? They were also quite small portions, so perhaps not suitable as full meals, unlike Tanja's ravioli. I personally was tempted by the polenta topped with courgettes, sweet potato and goats cheese. To keep us occupied whilst waiting to order, the waitress brought us gluten free oatcakes (I could eat these!), and homemade bread. Though very Scottish, it would perhaps be nice if they could offer gluten free bread, be it homemade, or simply toasted genius bread. The staff were very attentive, bringing us refills of the jug of tap water regularly, which had mint inside, a nice touch.  In the end, I went for the 'spicy' aubergine kofta, as I thought it was something I would be less able to make at home. It arrived served with a neat little pile of coriander rice, a side salad topped with a raita dressing, and some mango chutney. It was a nice dish, though I wouldn't say authentic Indian cuisine. Koftas usually come in a much thicker sauce, though here the koftas only have a light drizzling of sauce. I'm not against fusion food, and I realize this was a Scottish take on the dish, but the lack of sauce made them a little dry, and as others said, they weren't too spicy. I am being quite critical, as this was quite an expensive meal (11.90) considering the ingredients involved. If priced at around 6, this could be an excellent meal. I was pretty jealous looking at the dishes of those a  few heads down the table, who had ordered the mushroom bake with goats cheese and roasted winter vegetables. That looked truly divine, and well worth the price. I must admit I had high expectations for this place, as it has so many consistently positive reviews and has a good reputation amongst vegetarians in Edinburgh.  Overall it was a good restaurant, which caters well for dietary requirements, people seemed more or less happy with what they got, but I am not sure whether the prices reflect the food. 5.60 for a pannacotta? I realize David Bann has aspirations to be a michelin star vegetarian chef of sorts, but what I had wasn't THAT good. I just can't work out why they don't offer any Lunch deals... I think there is just so much good food in Edinburgh, and I have been well and truly spoiled with amazing vegetarian food. Kalpna is less pretentious, more friendly, more affordable, and offers much tastier food.  As is orb cafe, a raw food restaurant... Though this may not be to everyone's taste, it definitely wins in terms of innovation.  I feel kind of wrong, giving this 3 stars, when it has such consistently high reviews, but I just couldn't justify giving it 4 when comparing it to other restaurants in town. Maybe had I tried something else, I would have had a better impression of the place?",

This mid-market restaurant has a distinct air of sophistication; upmarket decor, well-dressed clientele, better dressed food. It lost a star for me because it had quite an impersonal atmosphere and as we were placed at a table squashed next to a wall (despite having a reservation), it felt a little cramped. That said, I really could not fault the food and it's worth ignoring the little niggley things when the food really is this delicious.  Service could be better, waitress kept forgetting things which was a little off-putting but she was friendly and helpful. Overall, worth a visit for delicious, filling veggie food that isn't the usual samey generic 'pasta' option. Particularly good for a birthday or a special occasion.",

    "text": "Eating here was one of the highlights of our visit to Edinburgh. Upon lots of research, we decided David Bann was the one restasurant we HAD to go to for a romantic, dressed up meal before drinks.   We were seated by the window, but I wouldn't recommend sitting there. We had to pull the shades down because directly across the restaurant is a hotel or a hostel and there were people watching our date from the window - not exactly great for the mood.   We ordered appetizers, glasses of wine, and a few dishes. Since we are both vegetarians, my boyfriend and I often go for the same menu item but decided to opt for different dishes and ended up eating out of eachothers plates for the whole meal in what was blissful silence. We are Indian, so to eat Indian food in a non-Indian establishment is always humurous to both of us, but it was flavorful and delicious. It was a twist on a classic dish but we loved every bite. The portions were generous, the ambiance was romantic, and we had such a special experience there.  And a few nights later, we ran into David Bann himself at a restaurant. It turns out he was sitting a table or two away from us at an Indian restaurant we were dining in and is a regular there.   I would recommend this restasurant to anybody and would go back any day I could for a special meal. It was worth every single cent we paid and will remain as the best vegetarian restaurant we have ever been to, the world over...we'll see what can surprass it!  Ask your waiter for suggestions - they have tried and fallen in love with dishes that you may also fall for.   David Bann is mind-blowing! Do NOT miss it!",

I'm not vegetarian, but was for several years, so I appreciated the idea of an upscale restaurant only serving vegetarian meals.    I think the menu has enough variety to keep veggies and meat eaters satisfied.  I ordered the roasted aubergine with puy lentils, mash and puff pastry for my entree and the hot peach and raspberry tart for dessert.  Really tasty stuff and I would definitely go back again.  My only complaint is service seemed a bit slow.  It took forever to get my drink order and we also sat around for ages waiting for the bill.

    "text": "Like Jenny, Elizabeth and Menno, we all headed here to try David Bann last night for a wee Yelper meal out. Most of us had heard great things about David Bann and were desperate to try it and although I've given it 4*, it is closer to a 3.5* but we can't do 1/2 stars.  So what I liked:   I've been in a fair few vegetarian and vegan restaurants around the world whilst travelling and they all seem to have that hippy, patchouli oil feel to them so it was nice to come somewhere that was more upmarket - wooden floors, candles, lovely simple decor.   There is a separate Gluten Free menu and there is plenty of choice. I was particularly impressed by the desserts. I didn't partake this time but there was plenty of temptation beyond ice-cream or sorbets so that would sway me to return. GF oatcakes as a starter is a nice touch - so many places offer gf options but no bread or oatcakes and tucking in and breaking bread is such a ritual when eating out, so its nice not being the odd one out.  Menu's sounded tempting and I did struggle to decide between a few options (again - choice is good) and as it has been a hellish month at work, then the large glass of red tempranillo I ordered was delish - lovely, warming and smooth.  I probably opted for the wrong starter. I had the Thai Fritters which were ok but I didn't like the banana relish which came with it and it meant they were too similar to my main which was the aubergine and chickpea koftas. The koftas were nice and tasty enough but I did notice varying amounts of sauce on everyone's plate (mines was limited) so I ate them with raita mostly. I just noticed that Jenny has called this coconut sauce and it was meant to be this, but I am certain it was raita on my plate and I liked this. I would have liked the pineapple chutney to have been separated from the raita (raita dumped on top) so I could get all the different flavours. I was ok with the rice compared to Jenny L but I do like rice plain and I'm not a huge coriander fan so I was glad this wasn't the overwhelming flavour.  Service was good - staff appeared well organised (little grid used when taking orders so they knew what food went where).  So what I didn't like:  David Bann has a high end reputation. I was thinking Mark Greenaway but pure veggies. This is not the case. This was disappointing.  It is expensive for what you get - my food was ok but I wasn't wowed. If I describe things as nice then its ok, not mind blowing and nice doesn't justify this price tag.   A few pounds cheaper and it might be ok but it may be a case of paying for the old town location.  I actually thought the presentation was quite basic so although the restaurant was visually appealing, the food wasn't as much. Also the one dish that did look appealing was the mushroom loaf Menno had and that was the one dish that did look like a meaty Sunday roast (with lots of sauce!)...  I have a friend who is vegetarian who does come here, so I would maybe go again, if only to ditch the starters and try the desserts. I'm sure he'd for once like a menu on one of our nights out where he can chose anything from it, not be restricted to one or two items. But for vegetarian newbies to Edinburgh, I don't think I'd be saying 'OMG you MUST go to David Bann...'",

The only part we didn't like was dessert - we shared the ginger lime ice cream and it was flavorless- which sometimes is fine if the ice cream is creamy- this one tasted like it had been lost in the freezer for a few months! Besides that, the starters and main dishes, as well as the service were fantastic.",

I love taking omnivorous friends here to allow them to sample just how good a meal can be that doesn't contain animal parts.  If I had any comment for improvement it would be that I would completely veganise the menu. I know that they will endeavour to make vegan a vegetarian choice if you ask, but I think this would be a perfect vegan place to dine if they veganised the whole menu. With the options available to cook vegan now it wouldn't be too difficult.  Regardless of this minor point though, I greatly look forward to eating here any time I am in Edinburgh. I love the fact that you can't book during the festival, as I like to spontaneity of eating out that this accommodates.

They were served on a bed of baby leaves and beetroot which had some kind of sweet and salty glaze to them. Drool... The smoked cheese cubes sprinkled over the top gave the dish another dimension. Different textures and different taste sensations. Can't believe I'm waxing lyrical over a salad!!!   For main I opted for the chickpea koftas which was served with coriander rice, a curry sauce and a cucumber and raita salad. I ate every bit! The koftas were soft with a nutty type texture. The sauce not overpowering but really complimented the dish well. Not a scrap was left on my plate!   I did fully intend to have a dessert but between the fennel seed roll at the beginning and the 2 courses I honestly couldn't have managed a dessert (well actually I could have probably squeezed one in but I didn't want my fellow yelpers thinking I'm a greedy cow!).   The service was great, the waitress really attentive and friendly and she didn't seem irritated by the fact a few of us has to pay separately as we were leaving earlier. The wine menu was pretty extensive and I opted for a cheeky glass of Spanish Tempranillo which was served at the perfect temperature. Mint and citrus water for the table and boom! An excellent experience through and through!  Would I go back? Actually, yes! Although the lure of meat from other nice restaurants might prove too much for me. I just wish i had a token vegetarian friend to give me the excuse to go back! Unfortunately all mine are die hard carnivores :(",

    "text": "Fool me once, shame on me, fool me twice.... as the saying goes, thus travels my experience with David Bann. When I stormed out of the restaurant last night, my head was saying Yelp review, 2 stars, but in the cold and calm light of day, it's really a 1 star, as why would I give an additional star for leaving my newly vegan's niece meal in such an angry state? Ultimately this is a tale of why, when you go to a restaurant, you are going in for a package; not only is the food drawing you in, but also the service, the ambience and the enjoyment of your fellow diners - and for this you pay a price; it is not a privilege.   DB was at a disadvantage with many of our (large) party being carnivorous, and reluctant at best to visit a vegetarian restaurant, but it did itself very little favour throughout the night. It will be difficult to persuade them to try another now, so thanks for that.   I'll separate out my review into two parts and cover off the good first - the food - for which the 1 star is rewarded. DB still suffers from hit and miss dishes - for me, I loved the olive polenta (others thought too salty) and my niece loved the broccoli/tofu fritters; however smoked tofu was too bland and under smoky; hazelnut ravioli welcomed and rejected in turn whilst the soup misfired (a battle between broccoli and mushroom, but the mushroom lost). Mains-wise the koftas were the outright winner of the night, with the coconut, courgette and tomato curry making a stunning accompaniment. Udon noodles looked overcooked and left mainly on the plate, and the adzuki and mushroom bean bake whilst looked good, suffered from undercooked swede and a Tyrolean dumpling that was twice the size it needed to be; stodgy and tasteless at that, bar an overpowering cheese at it's oversized heart. But overall, most enjoyed their meal, and the SR noted his meal was much better than his previous experience here (see previous, lengthy review).  Where our night really fell apart was in drinks and service. Hearing other diners, we did not experience this alone. We were seated at 7pm, and saw no-one for quite some time. Luckily there was water at the table, which was consumed and emptied long before our waiter appeared to take our food order. Evidently drinks were forgotten, so we ordered them with our food, and I asked for the water to be replenished.   Everything went quiet once more service-wise. My fed-up levels were at Defcon 1 at this point.  I pulled another waitress over and drinks appeared quite promptly; clearly idling on the bar. At this point, it was 8 o'clock. Water took another 10 minutes to appear.    Eventually, our starters appeared - slowly, with long gaps between plates appearing. Once done, we were back to the long wait. The waiter only showed up when he had to - no checking of enjoyment, or drinks (who needs drinks?) so opportunities were grabbed if he happened to be near our table, which was rare. My temper had reached Defcon 2.  Our main meals appeared - well, most of them. Unfortunately for the SR, his didn't (Defcon 3). After the waiter retook his order, with promises of appearance shortly; it turned out it wouldn't, as part of his order had run out (Defcon 4). What was left of his meal appeared long after everyone else finished their dish, even after I tried to pace myself so he wouldn't be eating alone.   Dirty plates, still on the table, the bill arrived. I asked to make a complaint before any money was transacted. Time continued to trundle on before the manager appeared and tried to claim that the SR meal was not overlooked, but I think I won that argument. Justification for slow service was being too busy and understaffed, but I'll be honest, that was the restaurants problem, it shouldn't have been ours. Fortunately, we did reach an agreement removing the SRs meal, service and 10%. The bill was then returned.   But then, so did the waiter. Now, perhaps it was a language barrier, but unfortunately, when a diner (at Defcon 4) is repeatedly told by a waiter to not be angry, that I still got my food and was still served, there was only one way this was going to go and despite my request for the waiter to stop talking (which went along the lines of 'back off, sir'), he didn't. Defcon 5 was finally reached. At that point the manager was back, and apologising for his team's behaviour.   The bill, still unpaid, on the table.   In fact, no one came back to take the bill. Our party having left, I walked my mother (the bill payer) to the bar to try to finish this awful night once and for all, where not only were we not acknowledged, it took all of my will power not just to walk out there, right there, right then, but my mother doesn't walk that quickly. An unmitigated disaster for which the food did not repair the damage service had done, and DB is forever crossed off this diner's menu. Avoid.",

Overall, my experience at David Bann was fantastic and, if my schedule allowed for it, I would have eaten there every day during my visit. The atmosphere is more on the intimate/romantic side but I'd happily eat there with family and friends too.   When our food came, the dishes had nice flavours and were well prepared, covering a number of different types of cuisine, including classic English, Thai and Indian. There were a few really nice touches on the menu, and the broad choice made it hard to make a selection, as it all sounded good. The pasta main I had (tofu and spaghetti in a tomato sauce; see photo) was very good.   The servers were very pleasant, knowledgeable and more than willing to answer any questions.   Though it's not a 'cheap' meal, it's well worth the money!",

    "text": "Who would have thought that you could get a world class brilliantly conjured vegetarian restaurant in the middle of Edinburgh!  The starters were definitely the best part about the menu. The caramelised onio tartlet with smoked cheese and slow dried tomato was delicious. The ravioli parcel was sublime with an elegantly blended mix of artichoke and chickpeas.  The mains were very moderately priced between 10-12 (moderate wrt London restaurant pricing). We tried the red pepper risotto, stir fried vegetables with udon noodles and smoked tofu and the Mushroom strudel with mash and Mediterranean vegetables. Everything was very flavourful, especially given that it was all vegetarian cooking.  We skipped dessert, and short of came back another time to try the remaining items on the menu. Highly recommended for vegetarians. The idea behind going to David Bann, especially for me who can't finish a meal without animal protein, was to take a set of elderly vegetarian Indians, a rather tough audience because of their seasoned and stubborn taste buds; and they loved everything on their plate.  The super friendly service (they did take some time to get us our food though), along with a tastefully modern decor gave us something of a warm welcome in Edinburgh.",

    "text": "I guess I dont really get the hype around David Bann.   We made a reservation the other night for a table of 7 people, most of whom are vegetarian or vegan. We all had different starters and mains, but no one really seemed that impressed. Overall the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant are very nice. Nice mood lighting, nicely laid out and very good service.   I started with the Thai fritters, which sounded very good on the menu. When they came they looked nice, but I was a bit let down by the flavor. The exterior was crunchy and golden brown, but the inside was completely mushy and a bit wet. I think it was supposed to be broccoli, but it was the texture and consistency of baby food, with a small cube of smoked tofu in the center. The 'banana chutney' on the side was two small slices of mildly preserved banana. A bit of a let down.   The main was probably worse than the starter. I ordered a vegan version of their risotto. Now, they are a veg/vegan restaurant, so I figured if they were offering a vegan risotto they were going to do a good version. It came out just... limp. The flavor was bland and it was very wet. It tasted a bit like they just boiled some rice in  low-sodium veg broth and added in some onion and mushrooms. Not great.   The boy ordered the 'chili pancakes' which came out looking like a burrito and piled up with all sorts of stuff. He said the sauce was just melted chocolate. It also had chili sauce and some kind of white yogurt-based sauce. It was a lot and the flavors were confusing and in the end he didnt even finish it, which is strange for him.   Overall the setting was lovely, the service was good and the wine list was nice, but we werent impressed. Perhaps because we all eat veg/vegan food on a daily basis we were expecting more?",

Previous times I've booked in advance (which you'll need to do - it's always busy!) but they don't take bookings during the Fringe so we joined the 30min queue out the door on a Friday night.   The menu has limited (5 mains) but interesting choices, an unexpected mix of Euro/Indo/Asian creations; the previous hit-and-miss reviews make me think I've somehow managed to only pick hits! On this visit that was the Ardrahan smoked cheese and tomato tartlet for starters (not wow but nice), and the more impressive chilli pancake stuffed with a mix of yummy beans, with grilled sweet potato, salsa and chocolate sauce (trust me, somehow it works!).   So thumbs up for tastiness, and I love the aubergine-walled look of the place too. But not a five-star because a) it's pricey for what you get so more of a 'special' meal, and b) the service is slow, but super friendly so just don't go if you're in a rush!   I've pleased both veggie and non-veggie mates with this place, and bonus hi-five for the biodynamic wine on the list too :)",

    "text": "I decided to go to David Bann on a Tuesday night for my first dinner out with a group of Yelpers after seeing some great reviews and comments on Yelp about how much people were looking forward to going.  I took a look at the menu online and was attracted by the desserts in particular.  They also have a photo gallery with pics of some of the dishes and these looked amazing!  I did think it was a little on the pricey side, but if it was superior quality then it could be worth it, so I had high expectations.  As I definitely wanted a dessert, I decided I would just have a starter and no main.  I was also trying not to spend too much.  I was disappointed with my Thai fritters of smoked tofu and broccoli with peas, fresh ginger, green chilli, lime leaf, lemongrass, sesame and coriander, served with fresh banana chutney and plum dressing.  Firstly I was expecting fritters would be flat...well, fritters!  Not round balls like they were. I certainly couldn't detect the lime leaf, lemongrass, ginger or coriander which are flavours that I really like.  Along with the other ingredients, these were overpowered by the smokiness of the tofu, although to be fair, I'm not a fan of anything smoked.  The was a hint of heat from the herbs and spices, but again I couldn't pick the flavours.  The dressings were nice, although the banana chutney was rather sweet and I would never have guessed it was banana.  After waiting for others to finish their mains, it was finally dessert time :).  I know some of the others had been eyeing up dessert also, so I didn't think I was going to be alone. However, as I turned out to be the only one wanting to order and some others were already about to leave, I didn't want to make anyone else wait for me.  so I left unsatisfied and wish I had just gone ahead with the dessert now as don't think it would have taken me too long to devour!  It was only when we left that I realised how busy the restaurant had become - almost full on a Tuesday night.  I wouldn't choose to go back for a main meal, but shall have to go back for dessert I think - Homemade ginger and lime ice cream served in a chocolate ganache bowl on orange drizzle cake anyone?",

So better get a reservation in before you get there, even its during the week!  The interior is very chic and modern with dark wooden tables and chairs and flooring. The dimmed lights give the place a romantic touch.  I ordered the mushroom ravioli, which were excellent, although only available as a starter. I believe they should do them as a main course. Instead of peppermint tea I got a mint tea with real mint leafs. What a lovely touch and nice too. They also offer gluten free meals.  Prices match the quality of food that you get, but food choices are limited.   TIP: Check out the menu online before you go there!",

    "text": "We went to vegetarian restaurant David Bann for dinner, which reminded me of Mildreds back in London. Viv and Ross had the beetroot, bramley apple and Dunsyre blue cheese mousse. It sounded rather interesting although I have to admit that I was not quite a fan of it. I could probably have it as a small starter but not quite as a main meal. I ordered the safer option of the Risotto of asparagus, celery and lemon. Nice and creamy, although it could have done with a bit more seasoning. For dessert we ordered the Assiette of desserts for 2 to share (or 3!) which consisted of vanilla and whisky pannacotta, homemade chocolates filled with sambuca, coffee and white chocolate, hot apple, cinnamon and calvados tart, with raspberry ice cream and pineapple sorbet. It is not that big a portion as it sounds, but at least you get to try all the different desserts. My favourite amongst them was the tart which was nice and warm and went well with the cold ice cream. The pannacotta was also pretty good.  I would probably have to try more dishes next time  to have a better opinion on the restaurant as a whole, but it seems like a pretty decent vegetarian restaurant option. It looked like it was almost fully booked for dinner, so I would recommend making a reservation, especially during the weekend.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdancing-in-high-heels.blogspot.co.uk%2F&s=9eb432dc71e63fe0e399f8a7cc8ff573d52b2d28191dbf6e099b2da0985d016b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">dancing-in-high-heels.bl...</a>",

I was lured into David Bann a few years ago by the promise of a Dark Chocolate Souffle - and let me tell you that dessert kickstarted a long love affair with this restaurant. Even though I have not lived in Edinburgh for over 3 years now, I still have very fond memories of their hearty soup of the days or their delicious homemade hummus (I still have not tasted a hummus better than the one they have at David Bann).   This restaurant has re-invented the way I look at Vegetarian cuisine - creating a bold and inventive menu packed full of flavours. Spicy chili with chocolate sauce, risotto with roasted red pepper, a baked courgette, etc. I love that none of the dishes are trying to be something they are not. No, you will not find imitation sausage or imitation chicken. This restaurant knows they are vegetarian and they design their menu to celebrate just that. And I think I appreciate it all the more for that.",

I wish David Bann would go all vegan and gluten free. I can imagine there would be a line out the door as no one is really doing good vegan food around here. The bar looked nice too! Walking distance to Waverly train station.",

The menu is good and the place was packed on a Monday night. It is obviously popular and probably not reliant on my review for success ;-))  The choices are better than you expect in a vegetarian place and the food is served beautifully and looks good. My starter was served beautifully but it lacked flavour for what was a thai inspired starter. My main course tasted delicious but it felt like there were three different meals on one plate as none of it went together but individually tasted excellent. In general the food lacked a bit of seasoning.   The wine list is nice and reasonable and the service is also good. It is a cut above many places that serves vegetarian food but for the prices you pay I expect more.   I would come back here however won't hurry back.",

And even more pleased that my non-vegetarian colleague was happy to try it out too.  We'd had to wait outside in a queue for about 20 minutes, as it was during the Edinburgh Festival and they don't take bookings at this time of year. We took the queue as a good sign, and it was worth the wait.  For starter I had fritters of smoked tofu, served with thai-style spices and herbs - fresh ginger, green chilli, coriander and so on. It also came with a banana chutney. I don't normally like fruit with any savoury food, but this was a combination that really worked.  For main, I chose  the aubergine, chick pea and cashew koftas.  They came with a delicious coconut, courgette and tomato sauce, aside salad and roasted sweet potato.  Pleasingly, my colleague also really enjoyed her meal, and was really impressed that vegetarian food could be so tasty.  Service was great throughout, and surprisingly quick given how jam-packed they were. David Bann seems to be a very popular place, which is well-deserved.",

    "text": "Holy bejesus, this was some of the best vegetarian food of my life! Came with four friends for dinner on a Friday night - had a lovely meal and left fully satisfied and satiated!   To clarify my PoV, I'm very much a meat eater, but picked this place out on behalf of my vegetarian friend (who always gets stuck with halloumi burgers). I can't stress enough how much I didn't miss meat during this meal - was too busy loving every bite!  We shared three plates to start: the caramelised onion goats cheese tartlet (a definite highlight, for obvious reasons), Thai fritter of broccoli and marinated tofu (lovely and full of flavour!), and the hazelnut and beet ravioli parcel (tasty but difficult to share amongst five, and the other two most certainly trumped).   One of my favourite things about going for dinner with friends you know well is the willingness to swap food! I'm always one for sharing, so I loved our merry-go-round of deliciousness at the table. Four different main dishes and each entirely scrumptious! My main was the Chilli pancake with grilled sweet potato, courgette and chocolate sauce. Absolutely delicious!! Mind you this is served more like a burrito than a pancake. One friend didn't love the chocolate sauce pairing (I whole-heartedly disagree) but we all agreed the contents of the pancake were delicious, and the white sauce with it was lovely. Also tried some of my friends' mains: - Aubergine, chick pea and cashew koftas: packed with flavour! Great if in a curry/spicy mood, and make sure to get a good bit of nut! - Parsnip, Bramley apple and Dunsyre Blue cheese mousse: definitely a highlight, partially for novelty same as this was unlike many dishes you'd get elsewhere! The mousse is more like a whipped souffle, with a tasty sauce; it's flavourful and decadent, and you never want it to end!  - Aduki bean and mushroom bake with a Tyrol dumpling: This one was still tasty but my least favourite of them all. The cheese inside the dumpling was delicious (because applesmoked cheese. Duh) and the flavours in the rest of the dish were hearty and well developed. A bit more subtle than the others perhaps and though the dumpling was tasty, the texture was a tad bit soggy.  Another great bit is being able to share a dessert at the end, even when you're too full to take on a full one yourself. We ordered the assiette of desserts for two to share, which is essentially like a taster plate of desserts and ideal for any other folk who have trouble choosing! Definite highlights on the plate were the vanilla & whisky pannacotta, as well as the apple tart and raspberry ice cream. We managed to happily share amongst 5 so if you find yourself in a similar fix, definitely recommended!  Found that Candlelight gave the restaurant a warm and lovely atmosphere, though be aware it's a bit more on the formal dining side in terms of style (being a fan of cosy, the hard wooden chairs called for the one star off).  By the end of this meal we'd shared two bottles of wine (my first experience with Viognier- bit on the thick/ Chardonnnay-like side for my liking, but tasty), one Ceasar Augustus, three starters, five mains, and a two-person dessert. The bill with tip came out to 30 between each of the five of us. Given the quality of the food, this was hugely good value!! It's rare to find a place with such unique 12.25 main courses, packed with as much flavour and personality as those at David Bann. Vegetarian or otherwise, this spot is very highly recommended for all eaters alike!",

    "text": "In the time just after I moved to the U.K. in 2014, husband and I made a list of restaurants we'd like to scope out together in Edinburgh. As long-time vegheads, David Bann naturally made our list, but it was only last night that we finally got to give 'er a whirl thanks to some vouchers from hub's work.  David Bann features a cozy interior of small, candle-lit wooden tables with nice darkened ambiance. Unfortunately for us, despite the fact that we got there at around 7 PM and the place was mostly empty, we were still seated just in front of the serving station where waitresses came and went collecting and dispensing food. It was a bit distracting to be sat there to be completely honest--S.O. and I agreed that perhaps that space would be better served being an empty spot, after all, there is quite a bit of space inside for seating. (The place did end up filling up very quickly, so perhaps it's understandable them using the space!)  Despite that, we were served and in quick progression beers and starters were presented. I had a polenta dish with goat curd and pesto, whereas my partner had a veggie tart that seemed fully loaded with cheese. Both were on point, and the mains that followed--mine a dense meal featuring aduki beans, his a delicious rendition of kofta. Not to be outdone though (afterall, when else will we get to treat ourselves with vouchers?!) we finished it all off with a sharing platter of desserts, consisting of little chocolates filled with sambuca, whisky and vanilla pannacotta, pineapple sorbet, and more. It was seriously DELICIOUS. (Be warned: if you try to run to catch your bus after a meal like this, you will feel like you are either about to give birth or hurl, so be advised NOT to do this.)  On leaving, partner and I agreed that David Bann was an excellent meal that we'd be more than willing to return to treat ourselves to later. Our only qualms with the place would be the rather brusque service from the night as well as our seating--nothing major, except after drinks arrived we were greeted with a, \"Well, whatdya want??\" from our waitress. Perhaps a little bit more friendliness woulnd't be amiss--despite that, not enough to detract from the overall experience! As a higher-end restaurant, the prices were still pretty reasonable, especially if you aren't planning on pulling out all the stops like we did. The food offers plenty of variety as well as excellent portion sizes. This is the sort of thing we enjoy seeing going out to eat, too often gifted with tiny portions at restaurants that only offer one or two veggie options to begin with. (Seriously guys--veggies are cheap, and when you see your friends tucking into a whole steak and a huge portion of chips alongside, you don't want a mere thimblefull of risotto for yourself!)",

I suppose I came into it with high expectations since the restaurant specializes in vegetarian food...so I thought hey of course it is going to be good. But eh... judging off what I ordered, I wouldn't make a point to come back.   My boyfriend and I decided to order two main dishes and split them. We ordered the vegetable stir fry udon noodles with smoked tofu and the  Chilli pancake with grilled sweet potato, courgette and chocolate sauce. In my opinion the stir fry's flavoring was off. I can pinpoint what it was, but I didn't care for it. The chili pancake was pretty good but the chocolate sauce killed it for me. I'm not sure if they were going for a mole' taste, but the chocolate sauce tasted like melted hersheys. It didn't make sense in the dish and I would have liked it a lot more if it was left out.   However, my friend ordered the risotto of roasted red pepper with kale and kohlrabi - I tried a bite and it was delicious.   Also, our waitress was an absolute joy. She was attentive, sweet and charming. I can also say the double gin and tonic was potent - which is always a plus.   All in all, I say this place is ok. Id stay away from the stir fry and chili pancake.",

Entering we were welcomed and led to a table in the middle of a bright, modern dining room. The service was good and attentive without being intrusive.  From the beer selection to the food it was wonderful. Try the heather beer taken from a 4000 year old receipe. It was difficult to make choices from the starters and entrees but we had the polenta with roasted veggies and pesto except for the bland cheese all the parts of the dish came together. Our entree was likewise impressive with  the spicy kafta (croquette) and the sweet plums a perfect compliment to each other.  Finally the three ice cream dessert was rich and refreshing. After our experience we were ready to see more of Edinburgh.",

Not the same basic food you find everywhere but very good and interesting dishes. I would definitely recommend to go there if you search something different. Also the portions are quiet big and I was very full at the end of the meal.",

    "text": "This was the meal I was most looking forward to in my vacation to Scotland. Although it was not the best vegetarian meal in the UK it was above average. If youre looking for a unique meal, i would recommend DB.  Here's what we ordered: - sweet potato & orange soup of the day: quite a remarkable balance of sweet potato and wee hint of orange. It actually sounded unpleasant bc of the citrus but my fiance ordered it and when i tried it I found it to be quite good.  - tofu appetizer: a total miss due to lack of texture. The exterior had no crispness, it was rather rubbery on the outside and mushy inside. The tofu had a hint of smoke but no other taste stood out. The mango curry sauce  to smear on the tofu helped the dish be palatable. The issue was the size of the tofu. There are 2 large triangles about 3 inches thick. That is too large to get proper texture.  Also the mango chutney needed to be more of a sauce for spreadability.    - chickpea curry: right amount of heat.  - quinoa entree wrapped in grilled zuchinni: creative but too dry.  This needed a sauce. And protein. The lack of protein in the dishes was disappointing.  The environment does nothing to enhance the dining experience. I can appreciate mminimalism if it is done well and this attempt missed the mark. 2 dark colored walls and meager lighting fixture were blah but the candle lighting on the tables are enough to keep the place at a good date spot.",

    "text": "\"David Bann Vegetarian Restaurant\" reads the outside window. For some reason I feel like vegetarian restaurants get a bad rap or are second class citizens to full spectrum places but David Bann would be a hard place to compete with, even if you did serve meat.  To start with, it's a very elegant place. The decor is tasteful, refined, with tablecloths. The waiters are well dressed and the lights are dimmed. Actually, since I came for a dinner with friends, I was slightly concerned it was too nice for a fairly casual dinner. However, the waiters were very kind, and the prices were reasonable for a nicer place.  The food, though, is what deserves the real praise, since it was fantastic! I had the strudel which was mushroom and goat cheese baked in filo with fried polenta on the side. It was one of the heavier options available but still didn't make me feel too heavy afterwards.   One of my friends enjoyed the risotto which was very tasty as well, can definitely recommend!",

They have an inexpensive Saturday/Sunday brunch dish but I decided to go for a couple of menu items ... and I'm glad I did. The homemade hummus was out of this world, especially topped with the tomato curry on those oatmeal crackers that it came with. (I went gluten-free this day so didn't taste the homemade bread.) For an entree I ordered baked parsnip pudding with potato and swede dauphinoise. Turns out this is actually two things: the parsnip pudding looks like a biscuit but definitely tastes like a pudding - not a desert pudding but a savory, smooth dinner pudding. The potato and swede dauphinoise is layered like a lasagne would be. (Swede is a root vegetable of which I hadn't heard.) it too was delicious and smooth. The carrot that came with was perfectly roasted, and all this food sat atop a perfectly crafted roasted carrot and green pea sauce. The service was excellent although at 11:30 AM I was the only one there. By the time i left two hours later the place had filled up. And no wonder!",

The only thing that was a bummer was when we ready to have dessert they told us that they needed the table in a half hour and we should essentially rush.

It was early, so the place was pretty empty so I was soon ensconced in a seat by the window.  Having so many yummy veggie & vegan things on the menu, it's hard to choose what to eat - it's such a luxury knowing that you can eat practically anything on the menu for once! I eventually settled for the Thai fritter of broccoli and marinated tofu starter, followed by stir-fried veg with Udon noodles and smoked tofu for the main, washed down with a large glass of Chilean Carmenere - a red wine that until recently was mistaken for a Merlot, according to the wine list. I'm not sure that it was the correct choice for my meal as I found it rather too rich for my taste, but it was an excellent wine nonetheless.  Everything too delicious for words, especially the main course which came topped with the biggest slab of tofu I've ever seen on a dish. However, I think I will still reserve my accolade of \"best tofu in the known Universe\" for the Hanoi Bike Shop in Glasgow.   So hat's off to Banns - still as good as I remembered. I'll try not to leave it as long before my return.",

I visited with a party of four and we pre-booked our table, which I would recommend as this is a very busy restaurant.   It's decorated in dark, rich wood and shades of aubergine, however bright lighting and a large open plan dining room ensure the overall atmosphere is relaxed and informal. On arrival we were seated and offered complimentary bread rolls. There's so much selection on the menus, David Bann really is Vegetarian Heaven so it took us ages to decide what to order.  Our starters consisted of one hummus with chutney and bread, one goats cheese, caramelised onion and sun blush tomato tartlet and two Thai fritters of smoked tofu, broccoli, ginger, chilli, lemongrass, sesame and coriander served with fresh banana chutney and plum sauce. Everything was sublime, unique, delicious and flavourful.  For my main I choose a parsnip, apple and blue cheese pudding served with roast vegetables and puy lentil stew. It was fantastic. My three dinning companions, even the carnivores, loved their mains as well. They all opted for the aubergine, chick pea and cashew koftas served with roasted sweet potato in a spicy coconut sauce plus green beans and sweet papaya side salad.  Service from our waiter was impeccable and although we initially planned to have three courses we were so full after two we just couldn't manage dessert. Nonetheless we've resolved to return and try the dessert menu when next in Edinburgh. David Bann is now one of my favourite restaurants and I would literally travel to Edinburgh just to dine here. I would highly recommended this restaurant, even those who aren't Vegetarian will enjoy the gorgeous food.",

Both times around I was impressed with the range of food on offer i.e. it was not all \"same-y\" and how much of the menu was also Vegan. I was a little disappointed with my main on my first trip but my boyfriends meal was nice however the starters and deserts were fab. The second time I was not disappointed and the waiter on this time was very helpful (advising us that the bread and olives was a rather large starter and really best for sharing as I was going to have it alone). The menu changes regularly which means that there is always something new to try. The good thing is the vegan chocolate ice cream never leaves.",

It is pretty unusual to have a veggie restaurant with this sort of vibe, modern and dressed to impress, which is a welcome change to knitted tables (although I'm fond of such things). And although the food is nice, the flavours in themselves are very much like other good veggie restaurants. And unlike other veggie restaurants the price tag is pretty high.   I wouldn't go back, as I think you can get the same quality at other places in a more honest fashion. By that I suppose I mean cheaper.",

Food was brilliant and as the review rightly said in-spite of being a meat lover, I was spoilt for choice, menu choice is good, for starters we had the Tartlet of blue cheese and slow dried tomato, which was delicious, followed by mains of Chilli crepe with griddled potato and chocolate sauce & Aduki and pistachio koftas. The food was well presented and delicious, though the quantity seemed just a little bit too much. For the desert had the vegan chocolate ice cream which was again very yummy.",

The restaurant itself draws from the chic and minimalistic style, if you like Mediterranean food then I strongly recommend you try this place for a meal. The atmosphere here is second to none. Perhaps the selling point for this restaurant is the fact that the prices are reasonable and the food it excellent. If you are a vegetarian then this place offers a healthy menu that I am sure you will love. The restaurant hasn't been open for that long, less than ten years I think but in its short life it has managed to become very well established in the area. The staff and polite and friendly, the service is quick and professional and I seriously can't fault it. I wish it was based here in Manchester because I seriously miss the food. The interior is very calming, it is lit subtle and the dark wood creates a great ambiance. I will be going back here in September when I go back to Scotland. A sausage",

Every time i go it feels like an amazing treat, but because its vegetarian i always come out surprised at how little it cost for the quality of food.

    "text": "The people who were 'disappointed' with this restaurant MUST be meat eaters, or at least vegetarians. As a (newish) vegan who goes here A LOT, I can tell you: DAVID BANN'S IS HEAVEN. Firstly, the service. In my experience the wait-staff are super awesome  obviously there's some rigorous staff training because they all have impeccable manners, and personally I think the service approach is more like a big hotel (Balmoral or similar) than a restaurant of this type usually has. It's above and beyond, really great. I mean, they always make sure you have a replenished water jug on the table, you're never sat for too long with empty plates cluttered in front of you, and if you have questions about what's vegan, what contains nuts or anything else dietary, they never have to say 'oh wait, let me check'  they are extremely knowledgeable about every single dish, all the wines I genuinely have no idea how anyone can fault the service. What?!?! Obviously, carnivores (yay, dead animal flesh and pus! Woo!) will be disappointed here, but for vegans the choice is AMAZING. Seriously  it's not just pasta with olive oil or a baked potato like we're used to. There are actually starters and desserts that vegans can eat! And wines that vegans can drink! The dishes are all creative and original and delicious. In other restaurants I'm sometimes a bit apprehensive about trying new things, but at Bann's I will try anything they put on the menu with total confidence, because I know it is guaranteed to be delicious.  Literally my only fault with this place is that they could change the menu a bit more often. But then my veggie partner was DISTRAUGHT when they took the chocolate souffle off the menu for a while, so maybe the old favourites stick around due to popular demand! LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  if you haven't yet, go there now!",

That said, this place has a really good atmosphere and decor and the staff are friendly if a tad slow. The food is of a reasonably high standard and clearly a lot of thought has gone into the dishes. My criticism is mainly that the food lacks flavour to the point of sometimes being bland; a distinct lack of depth of flavour or heat in their curries for instance. It strikes me that this is a slight throwback to the vegetarian=health food mentality of the 70's and 80's.   I still enjoy going here but if you've ever been to Cafe Paradiso in Cork or Terre a Terre in Brighton, this place seems a long way behind.",

Always had great meals at Hunter Square, but our experiences at St Marys St have been mixed - once I chose items that sounded great on the menu but were pretty awful on the plate, I'm afraid. We have also found the service to be very slow, even when the place has been really quiet.   We live a long way from Edinburgh and only get to go once or twice a year - Banns used to be a dead cert for us to visit, but the last time we just couldn't be bothered to go - our experiences have been so variable in the new place. Maybe we've just been unlucky, but to our minds there are better veggie places to eat in Edinburgh (Kalpna, Black Bo, Hendersons etc).",

    "text": "Does the idea of a vegetarian restaurant put you in mind of Birkenstock wearing hippies eating lentils from earthenware bowls?  Yes? Then perhaps you should pay a visit to David Bann's to challenge your perceptions. This restaurant has somehow managed to make vegetarian food sexy, stylish and interesting. The menu is packed full of tempting dishes and it's easy to forget that there is no meat on offer. The food is creative and original and takes influence from cuisine from around the world. I used to love the Aduki bean burger with goat's cheese; it's no longer on the menu, but it's good that they change things around regularly to keep it fresh and interesting. Weekend brunch can be a bit of a let-down for non meat eaters (imagine it without bacon or sausages!?!), but David Bann's does a good job of consoling the poor veggie buggers with 'Free range organic eggs cooked your way on toasted muffins, mushrooms, homemade potato scone and beans in a herb tomato sauce', it's served until 5pm on Saturday and Sunday and will only set you back 6.",
