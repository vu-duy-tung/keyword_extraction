We split the lion's share sirloin and ribs, with a bottle of wine. Everything was great - I really enjoyed the favorable spice rub on the steak and the bbq on the ribs. It was nice to not have to season my meat, for once. If I had any criticism it would be the chips - I prefer a nice, crispy potato and these were very soft, though wonderfully seasoned. Still, a small personal preference was hardly enough to derail a wonderful meal.",

    "text": "I never expected to be eating South African grill in Scotland, but that's where I found myself on a cold winter night in Edinburgh.  We had found this place after asking an unsuspecting passerby on the street on recommendations for dinner, perhaps thinking that the local patrons will take us to stories untold. Or perhaps my fingers would have froze if I had taken them out to Yelp.  Upon waddling up to the second floor of the building where Shebeen is located, the strong savory smells of hearty slabs of meat enveloped and ensnared us. My dad was dead set upon eating here. The only problem was that the restaurant was entirely booked! (Go make reservations if you don't want to wait!) The waitress told us that we would have to wait about 30 minutes for a table to clear. And so we waited. Thank goodness the locals showed us mercy and a table cleared up a bit earlier than expected.  I was starving at this point. But nothing could have prepared me for the onslaught that would come ahead. I didn't particularly feel like digging into a piece of steak, so I ended up ordering a burger. My parents got steak, although they were disappointed that the place didn't serve cheetah and lion meat. (Those were the names of the different sizes of the steaks.)  Then came more waiting. It felt like almost an eternity as we watched everyone else vigorously tear into their entrees like a pride of lions feasting on a kill.  My burger was enormous! And so were their steaks. The smallest size would definitely be enough for any normal person's appetite. I could end up only consuming half of my burger in the end, not that it wasn't absolutely delicious. The sheer amount of pulled pork on top of the patty seemed excessive, but hey I guess this place is a meat lover's haven. It also came with some potato wedges and a giant portobello mushroom! The mushroom was the perfect texture. However, it was smothered with a mountain of garlic. Good thing I wasn't on a date.",

Bunny chow I could have done without, it wasn't super flavorful and I wasn't sure what veggies I was eating, but his meal was big enough for the both of us. The side were great. The steak was good, but it wasn't cooked well. Against my better judgement and on the waitresses recommendation, we ordered it medium-rare instead of rare. I just had this feeling it would come overcooked, and I thought we should order it rare to get it medium-rare. Sure enough, our medium-rare came back medium. No pink anywhere except right next to the bone. It was still good, we just prefer our steaks at a True medium-rare: pink on the inside and maybe even slightly red still. The seasonings were good enough to make it tasty, though. I'd still recommend the restaurant, I'd just say if you need your steak at a certain temperature to enjoy it fully, I'd order on the rarer side.",

I tried the Mixed Grill, but there is a selection of steaks, sausages, ribs, and other meats to try as well.  The food tastes excellent. I was in a group of about 10, and every single person gave great feedback about the food. Steaks were tender and juicy, sausages just the right level of spiciness etc. Really, top class food. Portion sizes are great too. You will not leave Shebeen hungry. I struggled to finish my Mixed Grill, but I couldn't leave any of that delicious meat behind.  Service was a bit slow on the evening I attended, though others have said this was an exceptional case, so I'm not sure.  The restaurant is however too expensive for my regular budget. I attended for a friend's birthday, but I cannot splurge this amount on food on a regular basis, so I probably won't be back in the near future for this reason. However, if you appreciate good meat, and have a large appetite, Shebeen could well be the place for you!",

    "text": "For some time now the name Shebeen has been bouncing around the city as the spiritual home of carnivores! A place where meat is the main event.   Under the banner of being a South African restaurant the guys here have built up a reputation for serving up big plates of well cooked, well seasoned meat. It's a reputation which is very well deserved!   On reading the menu you quickly get a sense that this unapologetic reverence for beef had been taken to new levels.    On the starters you'll find samosas filled with either beef or veg, 'mini' boerewors with they homemade tomato relish, frikadelle - a meatball stuffed with various things including cheese and a number of the other main courses in start portions! I opted for the calamari however, crunchy, soft and delicious with a lovely dipping sauce!   If it was hard to choose a starter selecting a main was well nigh impossible, steaks of varying sizes, traditional South African dishes and some straight up meat challenges! Amongst these challenges you will find the Jo Burger, 1.2kg of beef or a custom baked bun WOW!! This would have to wait for a another day however, I was after some steak!    My friend Scott went for the Lion ribeye you see up on the board, that was sensational, cooked to a beautiful rare the flavour was superb! I went surf and turf, rare steak and prawns covered in garlic and chilli with double cooked fries!! This lead to coining of the phrase #meatgasm!  What really stands out for me in Shebeen is the care they give to the meat! From doing their butchery, to their seasonings, to the way in which they perfectly rest the meat before serving. These guys are the kings of grilled meat as far as I am concerned!  To top it all off the service and the welcome you receive is first class! The chefs are all more than happy to chat steak and the front of house staff are welcoming, funny and efficient! They really do have it all!",

It's located on the second floor near Lothian Road.   My partner and I shared 'fanagalo' which was such a large portion. It included: - meatballs - a half rack of spare ribs - homemade boerewors sausage - pork belly and beef sosaties'  OMG the ribs were AMAZING! I want to come back already for the ribs alone. The pork belly was really good too. Actually, everything in this sharing platter was so tasty - everything was very well seasoned.   For mains, I had the 'cheetah size' sirloin while my partner had the 'lion size' rib-eye. My boyfriend's steak was the size of a chopping board!! So unbelievable that I started laughing uncontrollably when the server brought it over. My steak was also quite large but manageable (mind you I did not finish it). The steaks were great. They weren't perhaps the best steak I have had but the price, we both agreed it was good value.  My boyfriend brought half of his uneaten steak home in a doggy bag.   I thought the service was good but there were some hiccups when our bill came - a beer that we hadn't ordered and the wrong wine was charged.  Overall, if you fancy some meat sweats venture over to this establishment. You'll definitely have a giggle when your steak arrives!",

I only ordered a main: rack of rips. I know how BIG the portions can be. My friends were overwhelmed with the sizes of all dishes, even the sides. We had to laugh as the food kept coming. The infamous \"meat bucket\" served 4 people and we could not even finish this one :-) Prices match with what you get. There are steak competitions. Warning: its Huge!

For those of you who don't know, the original Shebeen is located next to Mithas down at the Shore, Leith. So this new addition was a very welcome surprise.  We decided to pop in for a drink at the weekend to see what it's all about. I think it is easiest if I just split my experience into pros and cons.  The pros: - Great central location. - Fun South African themed interior. - We didn't eat this time but we saw food being served and the the traditional South African menu looks amazing. - Friendly staff.  The cons: - I had to change my drink order 3 times before they actually had the drink in stock. - It is pretty small and chilly inside. - The staff seemed a little nervous and unsure of what they were doing.  I shall forgive the cons. They are very newly opened and it is only natural to have teething problems, as long as they get them ironed out. For now, I wouldn't return for a drink (as it is just a small restaurant area) but i will go to their Leith bar for a drink, and I will return to Morrison Street to sample their exciting menu. After that I will update my review with the outcome :)",

I ordered the LION size and my goodness I was given a steak bigger that the average head !!! It was juicy , full of flavour and lovely !!!  Because it was a birthday meal for one of my friends we were allowed to bring a couple of bottles of fizz and the girls that served us were attentive and friendly.

I am happy to report that it did not disappoint and at 6.50/person (minimum 2 to share - although there's talk of the boys going back and eating a 2'fer on their own), it is really just a ridiculous amount of meat! The bucket comes with ribs, South African game sausages, kebabs, giant meatballs and the piece de resistance is surely the DEEP FRIED PORK BELLY... ON A STICK!! Yup huh... slow cooked pork belly on a skewer, coated in crispy batter & fried...  It's as amazingly tasty as it is bad for your health! (Luckily you only get one portion of each item per person).  I also ordered a starter size surf n turf for my main course, but I really didn't need any more food after the meat bucket... especially since we had cake for dessert... but I managed to find room in my belly for it anyways.  The thing about a restaurant that serves mainly meat is that they really have to know what they're doing in the kitchen.. it's so easy to under/over cook meat rendering it inedible or just a bit disgusting..  That was my only hesitation going in but I need not have worried.   Everything was cooked to perfection.  It was tasty tasty murder even if my stomach didn't quite agree with the sheer amount of meat I fed it...   Loses stars because the service was a bit ad hoc and hectic..  the space is quite small and there was another large party which meant we were rather squished and the servers had no way to get around.. passing plates up and down the table is never great.. there was manic arm waving in order to get more drinks etc.  It was a good meal and I can't fault it too much but I'm not sure I'm in a hurry to go back...",

Oh yes beer, Amstel, Castle and Corona or a good Savannah Dry cider to wash it all down with.   I like the atmosphere and a birthday meal for 6 people needs a big table - which they have. The zebra skin on the ceiling beams do authenticate the feel of this place, and the springbok skin oval shield with spears on the wall creates an idea that they catch and butcher their meat them selves - well the butcher part is correct!   The service is totally appropriate - always asking is all is fine or if you need more, MORE?! Are you kidding me? I am bursting after all this delicious meat.

    "text": "YABBADABBA DOO!! Finally went to this place after waiting and waiting to go I finally got to ! Awesome awesome place! Hidden little place, as in you could walk right by it and not even know it was there. Went in, the waitress greeted us and I asked for a table. She said most of the tables were booked but checked anyways to see if she could squeeze us in which she did and I was very thankful. She came and got us a pitcher of water and asked what we would like to drink. I had a cheap S. African beer which was ok ( it was a cheap beer what can I complain about) . We then ordered the appetizer which was recommend to me. The Fandalango, which was a bucket of meats. It was a meal unto itself. Seriously guys and gals thats all you need it was filling enough. But since I was feeling like Fred Flintstone and I am a Leo I went and ordered my steak to , but let me finish with the appetizer first. The fried pork belly was strangely good! I thought it would be a bit sweeter in terms of the meat but it was still really moist and yummy. The fat on it was the best part I think, it had that pork flavour with something else I cant put my finger on. The ribs were also amazing I think I started sucking the bone marrow out of them. Then my T-Rex steak arrived. WOW, um waitress, ma'am, sorry but theres half a cow here I think your butcher messed something up. The steak was huge!!! ( you can all see from the pictures obviously but I still had to tell you and one more time) The steak was huge!!! Perfectly cooked as well, I love my steaks pretty rare, and seasoned lightly. Thats my only bit of criticism I wish it had a little bit more seasoning on it, just a bit to enhance the flavour . I didnt even get into the little bit of chips on the side. I had one of the onion rings and it was good, not burnt , not greasy, slightly sweet from the onion and otherwise perfect. The salad on the side is to clean the palate so I had some of that as well when I threw in the towel. Great place I will be back again for the ribs. Sadly this lion couldnt finnish his lion sized meal and had to take it home in his doggy- bag.",

    "text": "Delicious and authentic Saafie food, epic portion sizes! The food was delicious and of a high quality. I'm a vegetarian, and while (being a steakhouse and grill) the veggie options were few, the Bunny Chow I had was tip top. My companions had the boerie rolls and said they were lovely too.   The staff were friendly and helpful. Our food took a little longer than expected to get to us although it was nicely presented and all fresh so that likely accounts for the fairly long prep time.  All around a good experience, nice ambience and great food. Service almost as good if a little slow.",
