    "text": "I think it's the late opening hours which makes Ping On such a Stockbridge institution. Also perhaps because we're all into retro, kitsch things and it's certainly that - cute net curtains and worn tables make it a perfect place to spend a drinking break.  However, being cosy and reliable is one thing - being chewy and bland is another. Even though it's a great place to eat n' chat it's not particularly great in the food department. Everything's a bit of a strain on the jaw and really isn't the most tasty.  The staff were friendly and confident and the price seemed to be lower than a take away. I will be back here but definitely not for the grub.",

    "text": "The food is merely okay, although I don't know why they fried their roast duck and still called it roast duck.  However, what I find unacceptable is that the sit in prices are different than the delivery/takeaway prices.  That's...really damn weird, and the price differences are actually quite large.    Wouldn't recommend this place unless you were up late and were jonesing for some Chinese.",

The decor and drinks selection at the restaurant are nothing special, so I think we're more likely to get this as take-out next time around.",

    "text": "'Emily, you HAVE to go to Ping on, it's like, amazing, yah yah yah' were the words I heard walking a rather tiddly and posh friend back home to Stockbridge the other night. I had heard about it, as it is open very late and feeds the drunk 2am market. What's not to like?  Well, I made the mistake of eating here sober. Don't get me wrong - it was edible, but only just. I had crispy beef and my friend had sweet and sour chicken, but they both tasted exactly the same. The rice was really cold too, which I'm always wary of following a less-than-pleasant experience in Tenerife with bad rice.  The shop itself is quite cool in it's own way...maybe unintentionally so but cool nevertheless. I think that going here after a night out is the best way to experience PingOn, inebriating the senses.",

We had a large order including crispy duck, squid, chinese greens, soups rice and the whole shebang. I cant comment on the restaurant having only had a takeout but that was tasty and fresh, and not gloopy and MSG-ified in that nasty cheap take out way. Try it!",

A bit filling for a starter but they were really nice.   I was quite disappointed when I came here with my work. Everyone at work was saying how nice it was and that they went there a lot so I was really looking forward to it because I love Chinese food. Then for my main I ordered Kung Po chicken which I have had a few times in other Chinese restaurants. It was horrible, the sauce seemed very oily and the chicken didn't have a very good texture. It totally put me off going back.",

The staff have no problem with you nursing a cup of tea for 2 hours.  On the food side of things, not good. This place is practically a take away with a seating area and table service. My the veg in my chow mein tasted a little old and the noodles were a little rubbery.",

The menu is quite extensive and exotic in places. The staff are always pleasant without being pushy and are friendly to children (of course our one is always on her best behavior because she loves the spicy chicken wings and Chinese tea). We come over from Fife and find the prices are a little on the high side, though I think the prices are typical for Edinburgh.",
