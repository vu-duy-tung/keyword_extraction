    "text": "Food for a Fiver List:  Avocado Maki - 2 Vegetable Yakisoba - 2.70 4.70  (I also got tea and wasn't very hungry. It's not a lot of food, but it was enough for me. Most of the sushi is fairly cheap so you can add another plate later.)  It's easy to end up with a large bill at the end if you're not careful because it's so easy to just pull stuff off the belt, but it's also entirely up to you. The plates are colour coded, and the menu has the prices for each plate. It's really a great set up, everything it as simple as it can be. There is a button you push when you want to order something or pay, if you get water (1.20) the tap is right in from of you, so you just refill it yourself, and calorie counts are listed on the ordering side of the menu. The food that is sent around works the same as what you can order price-wise, so if you see something in particular you want, it's not more expensive to just ask for it. When you order there are also more options including anything hot. Green tea, like the water, has free refills (1.70). The view in this one is also nice as it's on the second floor.",

    "text": "It's a place to attend if seafood is your forte, although there are non-seafood dishes available. Beef, Chicken, Tofu  As you walk in... After climbing the stairs.. Or escalator...although I use the lift simply because I can. Your struck by a queue of famished customers. (Be prepared to wait). Once seated the staff are very friendly and attentive taking drink orders first. Allowing you to browse the menu or assisting you if you haven't been before. Simply press the button at the side of your table and you'll notice the water feature next to your table changes colour alerting the staff you need assistance wether it be for more drinks or to order hot food that's not on the belt. The conveyor belt is more or less stuffed with different colour plates each indicating individual prices that can be identified by the menu. This soon adds up as the temptation to splurge gets to much as the small colourful and well presented dished slowly pass you. This means you can easily rack up a less than healthy bill at the end. (From experience). Each item is 5-8 depending on colour choice as mentioned. Though there are Monday deals on to which some plates are at a reduced priced of 2.50.   Now on to facilities.  The restrooms are a little un-catered for...there seems to be only one male toilet available. (Assuming as the other 3 Japanese  versions of the standard British gender symbols on the door where of what looked to be female ones)  The crockery available are all of Japanese tradition Wooden spoon, Chopsticks. And beginner chopsticks (sealed in plastic wraps) to which you have to assemble. These are all available at your table (No forks available). This can become and issue if your not experienced with the utensils.  A nice touch is the water taps at your table where you have a choice of unlimited still or sparkling.  The deserts available weren't to my taste . I tried The  Chocolate Mochi basically three soft rice cake balls filled with dark chocolate ganache filling. It was actually more like a horrid gel like shell casing covering a very smooth slimy brown substance Which very closely resembled what came out of a dogs rear end and simply dried up in the summer weather once bitten into.. Sounds appealing right? Texture is definitely an acquired taste.   As a whole..It's defiantly a place to try out Japanese cuisine, though i WOULDN'T recommend a full meal as can be very expensive in the long run. A lite-bite if anything else.",
