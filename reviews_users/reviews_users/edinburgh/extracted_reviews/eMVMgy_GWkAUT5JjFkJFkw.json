All sort of food to take away available, from pizzas, to pasta, passing through calzone or little pastries.   The decoration is entirely Italian, clear reminder of the Italian busy cafes where you stop for a espresso to keep your day goingthis cafe is just the opposite, a great place to relax and enjoy the italian snack gastronomy.   You can not leave this place without trying a slice of pizza al taglio (it's actually a square portion of pizza margherita) which is by far the best one I have ever tried outside Italy. Do try it!   Particularly interesting is that the radio station they listen to is in Italian!   Nice staff but no toilets unless you ask them to let you use their personal one:S  Absolutely affordable!   Get a real taste of Italy!",

I could tell it had just been defrosted in the microwave as it was an odd temperature (not cold, not hot). The rest of the salad consisted of old lettuce and far too many croutons(which I left), slathered in a lot of sauce. The parmesan was good.  I didn't complain at the time as my parents, who were with me, were about to leave and catch a plane and I had to be back at work within a few mins. The pizza others were having looked nice but I'm not into bready, wheaty stuff in the middle of the day.   Bottom Iine: I don't expect awful chicken for a 7/8 salad.",

A friend also usually enjoys the vegetarian Calzone, excellent value at circa 5. A great place to people watch when sitting outside in the summer with the Grassmarket Sunday market and at this time of year bands playing from the jazz festival. One negative was that outside tables now have to pay for their meal when they order. I presume that they had too many people leaving without paying - sad reflection of our society. We didn't order coffee or afters as we decided to wander elsewhere. I feel that they will ultimately lose out on the amount each person spends per meal. Time will tell.",

The restaurant has a really friendly and inviting atmosphere with lots of neatly laid out, clean tables and plenty of interesting pictures and ornaments to look at around the walls.   The staff are all warm and efficient, know the menu intricately and don't harangue you as can be the norm in some places. The menu has a great range of Italian dishes and I went for their Rigatoni Mamma Mia which had meatballs in a delicious tomato sauce.  It was served quickly and in a big, filling portion which was definitely sufficient for an evening main.  As a group we spent about 10 each altogether which we thought was an amazing deal considering how good the food was.",

Thats because on those rare Scottish sunny days, I would forgive you for thinking you were actually in Italy - or at least thats how it felt as soon as we took the plunge and grabbed on of the quickly filling seats outside Made in Italy.  From the moment we sat down, we felt as though we were in authentic Italy - a real Italian waitress who was impossibly charming greated us and took our orders. The food was fantastic - my pizza not only being square, but thin and crispy with a delicious topping of mozzarella and vine tomatoes - yum!  The coffee we then moved onto - we were reliably informed - was award winning, what ever that means - but it did taste damn good.  Overall, the experience was of like a small slice of Italy being placed in Edinburgh - and the weather brought with it.",

Normally you don't have to wait too long, but the last time I went in (during the festival) it was absolutely rammed, and it was quite a long wait for the food. To be fair this is because with the pizzas the dough is made fresh so takes a bit of time, but if you're in a rush then it'll be tight.   The food is excellent, I had a pizza with king prawns, garlic, onion and sun-dried tomatoes and my friend had basically every meat you could imagine. His was amazing and mine was really good, but I was a bit disappointed by the lack of prawns (only 6 on a 12 inch pizza). They have a range of pizzas and pastas and a create your own pizza option all at good prices. The service is efficient and friendly and it's generally a really good eating experience.",

It's one of many cafes in a row, and on days like today, where I was just there for lunch, it can feel like you're on holiday, sitting somewhere in a southern European piazza. They serve antipasti, pasta and pizza dishes as well as paninis, desserts and ice creams! I would definitely recommend the Veneto Panini, a fantastic dish of chicken, pesto, mozzarella and olives, which I think is priced pretty fairly. I'm also a big fan of their ice creams. I've had a meat calzone here, which wasn't on my top ten calzone list, but it was alright. Great place to sit outdoors on a sunny, lazy afternoon.",

In a city that is full of Italian eateries of various kinds, it can be hard to stand out from the crowd.  So here goes with my verdict of Made in Italy.  Like Jonathan, I had walked past this place a few times before going into it.  I went in for lunch, and sampled one of their pizzas.  It was a pretty good pizza, all told, and the Grassmarket relaxed ambience merely added to the feeling of enjoyment.  Whilst it maybe doesn't compare to a Zizzi or Pizza Express, it was still very good for what it was.  I would be prepared to go back here if I was in the area; it's perhaps not the sort of place I would travel a distance to eat at.",

The food here is top-notch, with hefty portions and low prices. They do student discounts and it's open until two in the morning, so you can come here for a stromboli after hitting the many nearby pubs.

But there are real good and bad points.  We had a pizza slice each, at less than 2 each these are a real bargain. You can chose your toppings, I went for mushrooms and sun blush tomatoes, bro went for mushrooms and black olives. The base is really quite thick and spongy, like a deep pan pizza so not for the thin crust lovers! But it was good and filling and we scoffed them down! Service is ok but we were told to pay before we'd even been brought our drinks which I think is pretty outrageous! My brother challenged them on it, asking if they thought we were going to run off and she replied \"it happens\". The price of his small bottle of beer was also an incredible 4.50 which we had not expected. We were not offered fresh parmesan or black pepper and so helped ourselves. the waiter didn't like this and gave us some filthy looks as if we were going to steal it, or maybe just his job! I had an after dinner cappuccino and it was fine, not amazing, not awful, just average. I think that pretty much sums this place up to be honest.",

Now that the work in the Grassmarket is nearly complete it will become much more pleasant to sit in their increased outside terrace space.  Inside, they usually have the Italian radio playing so you can pretend that you are in sunny italy and not in rainy Edinburgh. Wide range of italian snacks, traditional pizza, folded over pizza and some more substantial meals. Also a good range of italian cakes and biscuits, although they have sadly stopped stocking the very traditional italian plain lemon cake which used to be my favourite with a morning cappucino.   A good spot for a coffee if you are early for your class at Dance Base and also a good spot for a bit to eat after browsing the shops in the Grassmarket.",

We were told that there was no dining inside left for the rest of the evening and we can sit outside if we wanted. We decided to since we were so hungry and it was late. Our server took awhile to bring out for the water and finally we got to order. Very slow!! I wouldn't typically be so impatient but at this point it was 9pm and we had to sit outside and it was 45. Finally when I couldn't bare it anymore, we were grabbed to come inside when they had an open table. We had ordered while we were outside. We got the garlic cheese bread to start and I got seafood pasta.   Since the food took awhile, we luckily didn't get it until we were warm inside.   The food was delicious. The seafood in my past was all huge - the mussels and the shrimp. Even though the service was slow - our server was extremely friendly. And I'm glad I was able to enjoy the food in warmth.",

It took over an hour to get our appetizer salads, and about 40 more minutes to get our two 10-inch pizzas. The big upside: all of the food was absolutely incredible. My starter salad consisted of only rocket greens, generous shavings of parmigiana reggiano, and luscious balsamic vinegar, and it was fantastic. I had the four cheese pizza, and the cheese was fresh and bountiful, the dough perfection. My husband was likewise impressed by the food. That said, I wouldn't go there again based on their service.",

I really wanted some italian food at this point so I agreed to sit outside, but a few minutes later the manager came back, he had managed to squeeze me inside! Very pleased.   Though he warned me that the kitchen was very busy, he brought me a glass a wine asap (which was delicious) and the food ended up coming within 20 minutes. I ordered the spaghetti bolognese and it was fantastic, especially with the wine.   The serving staff were very friendly, I didn't feel awkward at all eating alone. I highly recommend this place!",
