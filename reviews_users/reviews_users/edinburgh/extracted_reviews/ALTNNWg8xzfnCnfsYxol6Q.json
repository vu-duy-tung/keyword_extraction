    "text": "In mood of pho, so ordered a Bun Bo Hue, and a Egg Coffee. The broth is surprisingly sweet instead of a savoury taste as I expected. But I would say the beef is well cooked and tasty. Also enjoyed sprinkling chopped peanuts and chillies in it, as they added different textures to the soup. Egg coffee didn't taste so different from coffee with condensed milk which I had in other Vietnamese restaurants. Only when drinking the last bit of coffee, I felt somewhat the texture of egg. All in all, it was good and personally I think I would visit this restaurant again.",

    "text": "While I'm really happy to see this kind of southeast asian food opening near campus, the flavor of the food seems inauthentic and somewhat lacking.   While I have had pho from Saigon to Hanoi, and am a therefore a little hard to please, I'm more comparing this to other asian food I've had in the UK and US. Even by those standards it is pretty weak. I ordered the Bun Bo Hue - a fabulously rich and spicy beef soup from Hue in central Vietnam. The noodles were tough and bland, and the soup, while well spiced, seemed to lack the depth of flavor that I've come to expect from Pho.   Would maybe go again to try the bahn mi or other options.",

    "text": "The atmosphere is very modern and hipster, but the pho was quite underwhelming.   I ordered the Bun Bo Hue, but the taste was as far from traditional pho as you can get. So, if you want VERY 'fusioned' pho, this can be a place to try, but not if you are expected traditional pho. Bun Bo Hue is suppose to be a beef and rice noodle soup dish with shimmered beef shank, lemongrass, shrimp paste, and spicy chili oil. However, the dish was lacking in the spicy department. The beef was quite dry. The soup was overly sweet, and the traditional ingredients aren't used here.   The service was also overall a meh. We seated quite literally in front of the open door so it was really drafty. We had to ask a couple times to even get a menu and utensils.",

    "text": "Summary: A chic and well designed \"pho\" place that offers mixed feelings  If you want traditional Vietnamese Pho, this isn't the place for you. The flavor is drastically off and the ingredients used to make their pho are totally different. However, IF you are into a fusion form of Pho, take a chance and try this place out.   I, clearly, wasn't a fan of the pho here. The noodles had this weird earthy taste while the broth lacked the flavor of beef. The broth was on the sweet side and clearly made to suit western tastes. Coming from Los Angeles, I was really surprised how the dish I had was called pho. However, the ONE thing I did like about the pho was that the beef they used was high quality and tasted amazing.  The beef was juicy and tender, as if it would melt in your mouth!  Service is dodgy. The servers here offer you service based on what you look like and how you dress. When my friend tried to order her dish while I was in the restroom, the waiter apparently told her \"Not now I'm busy\". However, when I called him over after returning from the restroom, it seemed as if the gold chain on my neck turned me into a \"vip\" client. He quickly took my order and apologized to my friend for his error. My personal experience with the service is good, but others might have it differently.   On a side note, it seems like my friends really like their stir fried rice noodles. I have yet to try that--but from what I heard they are DELICIOUS.",

My only complaint is that the Chicken Pho is a bit bland. I would recommend the curries before the pho if you want lots of flavour.",
