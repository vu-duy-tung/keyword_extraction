    "text": "Solid food at Amarone.  I was heartbroken when Massimo Edinburgh closed as I loved their food and adored their staff.  You can tell when there are Italians in any kitchen.    Amarone's location and ambiance are certainly a step up from Massimo.  So are the prices...while not expensive, don't expect to walk out of there without your wallet feeling a little lighter.    As a starter, I had the prosciutto with fig and honey.  My friend had the beef carpaccio. Both were adequately done.  I couldn't really taste the honey, but the sweetness of the figs perfectly balanced the slight salty tang of the prosciutto. The carpaccio was great.    For dinner, she had the gorgonzola risotto. It was out of this world.  I had the goat cheese ravioli.  It was fine, but didn't knock my socks off.  The tiramisu almost made me forget the relative blandness of the ravioli. I must point out the pasta, while missing a little something on seasoning, was cooked to absolute perfection.  The pancetta peas are NOT to be missed. If I could order a gigantic bowl of those with Amarone's version of garlic bread, I'd be in demi-heaven. The crusty bread DRIPS with butter.  Divine.  The house Chianti was above average.  Didn't try it but as the pizzas were swept past us to a neighboring table, they looked like plated art.  I'll try one next time I go.  *be prepared to pay with cash. Apparently their modem has a tricky connection, and doesn't always work. Luckily my friend had enough green to cover both of us, otherwise, I'd had have to sing for my supper.",

    "text": "My saving grace after my walk out of another restaurant. After explaining the situation to the manager upon arrival, they reassured my mum and I we would be taken good care of. Service was extremely friendly, speedy and efficient as usual and the pasta lovely. The spicy sausage penne pasta was the clear winner for me.   I do think its a tad overpriced however who am I to squabble over a pound or 2 when the service is so top notch. Exactly what I expect from a restaurant situated in George street though surrounded by competition.   It's not somewhere I ever plan to go to or book in advance but on occasion when I want tasty Italian food near that end of town it does the job nicely. It's generally busy with a bustling, George street type atmosphere. It doesn't epitomise the quality of restaurant Edinburgh has to offer but it's worth an impromptu, post shopping pop in.",

But the food was good - I quite enjoyed the herb bread and the lamb in red wine (jus) was mostly promising (I thought the wine seemed slightly water compared to ther versions i've had of it) and I managed to take in ALL the spices which'd been hidden in the one spot in the salad in one bite which could've been placed better. But the lamb itself was of excellent quality and they had some reasonable beers to select from.",

    "text": "on friday night, i found myself out with three guys and about 4 drinks in on an empty stomach.  i made a silent plea to my boyfriend that we desperately needed to get dinner at almost 9pm and alas we ended up at amarone.  i'd been to the glasgow branch a few times before so i knew this place was decent and after a few drinks i found the food to be pretty amazing!  we were seated right away when we walked in at a booth not far from the front door.  now this place looks quite larger but since we only moved a few feet away from the door i can't actually confirm that. however, the big open bar space in the middle of the booths at the front was quite nice and helped mix those dining with those having a drink and maybe some nibbles at the high top tables.  i found this to add a good atmosphere, but it may have been a wee bit loud for some people.  we may have been a wee bit tipsy, so making decisions on what to order was relatively quick.  our starter of garlic bread and a bottle of red arrived just moments after asking for it.  the wine was poured and at 15 for a bottle i thought it was incredibly nice, very fruity and easy to drink.  sorry that i don't remember the name... the garlic bread was super buttery and garlicy and so good when i'd not eaten anything since my lunch at noon.  only about ten minutes after the garlic bread and wine arrived, our mains came along.  i'd ordered pasta with sausage in a tomato and ricotta sauce.  the dish they brought me out was huge which made the serving of pasta look a bit small.  however, it was just an illusion because there was a good serving of pasta mixed with loads of tasty sausage.  recalling it now, i found it incredibly delicious and i'm tempted to re-create the dish at home.  i also tried a few bites of my boyfriend's steak which was incredibly tender and full of flavour.  i was a bit surprised as this is an italian not a steak restaurant, but they certainly knew how to provide a good bit of red meat.  a bit tipsy or not, i definitely enjoyed this place and it's a nice addition to the george street scene.  i thought it was reasonably priced as we'd had 4 mains, two starters, and two bottles of wine which came to 30 per person.  also the service was speedy and efficient which is so important when you arrive starving at a restaurant!  i think i'll happily pop back in when i'm out shopping or in need of a good meal after a few drinks.",

    "text": "I always forget about Amarone (I don't really understand how because it's massive and situated at such a prominent corner of George Street), but for some absolute non-reason, I do.  I've had several experiences at Amarone, and most of them were positive. In fact, all of them were pretty joyful, with one occasion just having an edge of being slightly amusing, because it was mid-Christmas carnage and I think the staff had all reached a point of delerium, and so had all the squiffy Italian food-desiring punters, so the fact our orders got slightly mixed up and my friend got parmesan scattered all over her pasta shortly after saying \"no thank you\" to the offered delicacy really didn't matter, because the food was really flavourful anyway. And, as a separate point...who doesn't like parmesan cheese? Having pasta without parmesan is like leaving Thelma without Louise, Bill without Ted, Mario without Luigi... mind running out of famous pairings...but anyway, pasta without parmesan is wrong, and if you don't like it, well, get to like it. It's one of the Italian high gods of cheese.  Anyway, some useful details to note about Amarone - the portions are generous, which is handy to know, because I've gone for the set lunch menu twice (which is very reasonably priced) and been pretty full before I'd even got to the main course. The minestrone is very, very tasty, obviously a traditional Italian staple and just the most satisfying, hearty zuppa if it's done properly. Because I'm completely inept at making risotto myself I always tend to try it out in restaurants, and Amarone's risotto with crab meat, tiger prawns and cherry tomatoes is tremendous - top it with some rocket salad, team with it a big glass of white, and you are set for culinary happiness.  As I said, the place is huge, and despite being on the main George Street thoroughfare it's a good place to know about if you want impromptu pasta or pizza of decent quality and you've not made a booking, even if it's at the weekend, as you're likely to get a table straight away, or at least not have to linger around for too long. There's a decent bar area where you can enjoy a drink while you're waiting - I'd keep it classic and sip on a Negroni.",

Mine was about 15-20 mins past pink. It was tough and grey, which for the price I paid for it, is inexcusable. That said, the menu had many other options I would be willing to go back and try (at least to give it one more chance). The real gem to this restaurant's crown is a lovely outdoor sitting area on George Street, where I was able to sit back, sip my wine, and watch the rush hour crowds scramble past. I also had very kind, while somewhat slow, service. All in all, I'd try it again if someone I was with wanted to go, or I didn't have another new and exciting place in mind.",

The food may be slightly on the expensive side, but you must remember that you get what you pay for.

I *think* it was probably just a cultural difference thing--we are used to people from the South of the U.S., so maybe we just didn't mesh well. Who knows. Anyhow, my husband and I ordered the bruschetta (which she pronounced wrong... thought that was strange), and we split a margherita pizza. Both were good, but nothing to write home about.

Service is quick and polite, and the menu has a lot of options. Normally I get put off by large menus, but actually, every item I spotted is quite different to every thing else, and narrowing it down was quite easy in the end.   For two people we had 2 courses, a nice bottle of red and it cost around 65 quid altogether which is pretty good value. The portions were fairly generous as well and I left feeling more than satisfied.   All in all, a great venue and restaurant, and especially for those on dates or celebrations!",

The first thing to say is the service is excellent, attentive and polite and always on hand when required.

The starter was huge, two massive piece of bruschetta with fresh tomatos, lots of garlic, rocket and balsamic. Simple and delicious.  For the main ....wow!! I am a man that likes his shellfish and his dish was great. Nice al dente pasta with chunks of lobster and tomato with a rich luxurious lobster sauce. NOM!!! Needless to say I was a happy boy.

    "text": "What a great change to the stuffed to the gills, claustrophobic pubs in Edinburgh!  Clean, spacious, and modern inside.  Waiters are most likely named Marco (we had Marco #3 of 4), and are transplants from Italy.    A wood fired pizza turns out a perfect pizza - crispy, non-soggy crust, a bit of char, and the tomato sauce balances the mozzarella perfectly.  The Margherita pizza could use more basil, though.  The tiramisu was not over soaked, so the lady fingers still held up well and had great texture, and the biscotti was, well, biscotti and not what I though one would garnish with.  I enjoyed it though!  Lastly... The drinks are out-of-this-world.  I enjoyed the Amarone Classico.  Champagne, sugar, bitters, amaretto, and brandy.  One was plenty!",

    "text": "Came here on a whim after a day sightseeing in Edinburgh & it was a pretty good choice. The pre-theatre menu. (14.95 for 2 courses, 17.95 for 3) had a really good choice of dishes and the A La Carte looked extensive (although I didn't study it as I was happy with the pre theatre). We decided to go for the rosemary & sea salt focaccia to share from the main menu as a starter & this is the only reason they got 4 stars from me, instead of 5 - although the bread was beautiful & fresh there was hardly any rosemary at all & neither of us could taste it. The mains were fresh and tasty (penne with sun dried & cherry tomatoes, olives & mozzarella for me & Italian sausage pizza) and we both thoroughly enjoyed them. Desserts were also lovely, again tasting really fresh (mascarpone ginger & honey cheesecake for me - I couldn't finish it as I was too full! And raspberry panna cotta). The fact that they do cocktails was a bonus & they were fairly reasonably priced for a restaurant - 6.95 for my raspberry bellini, which was definitely made with fresh raspberries. Looking over this review I've used the word fresh a lot & I think that was the stand out reason that is come back here!",

The caprese salad was good but the salmon over mashed potatoes was blah.  I wouldn't recommend it but it wasn't the worst food I've ever had.",

Even though with a group, there was great beverage service followed by a 3-course meal with a varied choice for each course. Service was prompt and attentive. The food was among the best I had in any restaurant throughout the U.K. I will be back in Edinburgh next summer and this is on my \"must-go\" list. The noise level is rather high was my only complaint.",

    "text": "All I am saying is that this place plays with your mind, man. You go down a set of stairs to the bathroom (take a packed lunch, it's an epic trip), and when you pop back out at the top again, you leave through a different door. I didn't even see the door that I came through. I didn't drink anything down there when I was in the lair of the beast, nor did I pick up any cakes labelled 'eat me'. After two shandies, I was a bit concerned about how drunk I was that I didn't recognise where I was, and had to do a shameful sneak around, staying close to the wall, til I figured out my bearings. Very sneaky Amarone, I need me some arrows showing me the way home.   I haven't eaten at Amarone yet - but there is a small bar area at the front with table service. For the likes of me who hates going to the bar (yeah, I am one of 'those' girls), it's awesome, but when it's busy, it's a little difficult to get the attention I so readily deserve. However, it was all very pleasant, despite how busy it was (being a Friday night), and despite it felt a bit strange to be drinking in a restaurant. I'll try the food another day.",
