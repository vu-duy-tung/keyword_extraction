Smaller premise guarantees better service from the owner Shi.  Definitely one of the lesser know good Chinese restaurants!  Honestly this is the only Chinese food I will continue to eat.",

    "text": "Not recommended. Was served dirty plates, which we asked to be cleaned.   Food was basically standard takeaway food served on a plate. It was good, for a takeaway, but not for the price of it, 8-10 a dish not including rice. I had the chicken satay and my partner had salted chilli pork and egg fried rice. He liked his meal, but he likes dry food, so has weird opinions. My meat was squashy and the sauce was just a sweet flavour with no hint of peanut.  Prawn crackers were good.   Interior of the place is run down and dirty, with awful carpeting and mess visible in the back of the restaurant. The waiter hovered around behind us which put me off a lot.",

    "text": "This is the best takeaway that I've managed to stumble across in this area and not only that but it manages to couple this with being the best value as well.  This feat is achieved, as is so often the case with my favourite takeaways by offering rice as a separate item rather than as an item included in the price.  I pass through here on my way home and along here you get a line of very good and very friendly, with this place no exception, shops that will serve your needs most admirably.  As a result, I'm more than happy to stop here to visit the shops that have remained open and if it's late enough or indeed sometimes early enough in the day pick up a meal on my way and then cook the rice myself when I get in.  As the meals go, these start at 3.90 and go up from here without really venturing beyond a fiver so it's certainly good value for money.  Whether you want to sit in or takeaway, this place is worth a visit.",

Although the food actually took a while to arrive we weren't bothered just because the guy behind the counter had a smile on his face the whole time.   The menu is well priced and has a good range of authentic chinese dishes.  Their egg fried rice is excellent and tastes really aromatic and moist.  I had it with sweet and sour duck which was also amazing and had a great range of flavours.   I certainly recommend Good Year, it's so friendly it's almost fun.",

    "text": "Bad week, Good Year. I tried this place out after a disaster of a few days, ending in my oven exploding. Great excuse to try something Good!  Good Year has a standard Chinese Takeaway format. Don't expect anything out of this world. But as Takeaways go it's pretty good. For a start I completely agree with Gibson about the staff. I also had a really great, smiley service. The place itself was nice and clean and smart, which is something I always like in a takeaway.  The food is decent but nothing out of the ordinary. Fairly standard for a Chinese takeaway, but maybe a little less greasy than normal. For vegetarian dishes expect to pay on average around 6, which might seem like a bit too much (I think it is) but this is a bit better quality than your average Chinese.  A slight cut above the rest. Very friendly staff. I might just give this place another go.",
