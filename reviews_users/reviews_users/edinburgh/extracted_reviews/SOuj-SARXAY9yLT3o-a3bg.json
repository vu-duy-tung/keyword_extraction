    "text": "Pan Asian restaurant with options such as Bahn Mi, Pad Thai, and Pho.  Oddly, the waiter had no clue what I was saying when I tried to order Pho, but corrected me saying it was \"Foe\" - erm... no.  Generally speaking, the food was not bad, and if you don't normally eat Asian food it would be good. But it was disappointing from the perspective of somebody who grew up on this stuff. The Pad Thai was by far the best dish, but I don't think I will return just for that!",

How do you make such terrible PAD THAI????? So simple.  Utterly, utterly flavorless. And the flavors that you can detect are often far too sweet.  O! And my order was said to be ready in 10 minutes -- but it took 30!!!!!!!   Never returning !!!",

    "text": "I was really excited to see banh mi on a menu in Edinburgh (sadly a rare occurrence), but I shouldn't have been.  The \"crispy\" tofu was 8 (the others are even more expensive), and came with the thinnest slices of tofu I've ever seen. There were literally chillies or coriander, the only \"pickled veg\" was grated carrot. No spring onions, couldn't taste the advertised peanut sauce or ginger (even though we saw the chef run back from the local shop just before our food came out with a jar of peanut butter). We told them that the sandwich was missing the listed ingredients, but ... nothing. 8. I felt so ripped off.",

My dinner companions didn't enjoy theirs as much but they ordered different things and this is my review so they can sort them selves out if they want to drop a point of view. :D  Positive - banh mi beef was excellent, I covered this in Siracha for a bit more kick after a few bites - service was excellent, it seems to be the same lady that  always does front of house and she is really helpful - Other foods: fish cakes were really nice and so were the five spice chips.  Minus - A little expensive for some things, such as the pickles were 3.50 for a little bowl",

The inside of the place is bright and clean, great for a casual lunch or light dinner. There aren't too many places to get Vietnamese (style) food in the area so I do enjoy it. The hoisin chicken summer salad rolls are SO delicious and my favorite light dinner. I mean look how good they are. I look forward to going back and trying a bunch of other things.",

    "text": "Vietnamese food is hard to come by in the UK, yet there I was, craving a vegetarian pho and a Banh mi. In London there are many authentic Vietnamese earteries, none of which offer the easy-to-come-by \"chay\" cuisine (Buddhist vegetarian) on offer in Vietnam.   Saiko offers a bit of a mish mash of different cuisines and flavours, though the main offerings are Vietnamese and Japanese fusion dishes. Upon entering I knew I would be going for the much sought-after Banh mi, I opted for the ginger tofu filling. For 5.95 the baguette was pretty small, but the bread was surprisingly very good (from la Barantine maybe?), the peanut sauce was very fresh and tasty and the tofu was crunchy. The salad and coriander inside were as would be expected, colourful and tasty.  Not sure what I think yet about Saiko kitchen, but the quality of what I had was good. I enjoyed the baguette, but found it to be a little expensive if you consider Vietnamese prices (no good comparison, I know).",

    "text": "There should be a word for when you set your expectations too high and the end result is - unsurprisingly - less than satisfying.  Saiko'd.  You got saiko'd.  That works.  Anyone who hangs around the talk boards will probably be aware of my hunt for a decent Banh Mi sandwich here in the capital. Besides Thai, we really do struggle for some quality South East Asian fayre. So when I catch wind of a decent Vietnamese deli, or a Malaysian street food place, I'll need to check that badboy out.  Blythe was good enough to recommend Marchmont's Saiko as a solution to my Banh Mi woes. So on my birthday day off, guess where we headed?  The girl inside was very nice and friendly. Considering the place was dead, I think that's 'nuff said. Said hello, took our order, took our money, said goodbye, smiled a lot. The end.  So walking out of Saiko, bagged sandwich in hand, I first noticed the shape was wrong. Banh Mi, real Vietnamese ones, tend to adhere to a specifically shaped baguette. The baguette in my bag was not it, instead a long and narrow number you might find in a supermarket housed the contents of pork, pate, coriander and pickled veg.  What there was of it.  Yes, the biggest gripe of this visit was in the contents of the sandwich. Two words: not very much. A thin layer of pork, bolstered by wads of veggies to try and make it look substantial, but even they didn't seem to do the job. It all came across a bit too bready and downright stingie.  Considering this badboy - a sandwich, people! - costs a whopping 5.95, I would really expect a little generosity between the bread. The flavour was all present and correct, and I must say even quite authentic, but with such a measly filling, the bread overwhelmed it all. Disappointing.  I'll get myself back there one day - the menu looked interesting and I'll be curious to see if they are more generous with other dishes like their Pad Thai or their Dim Sum - but for now I think Banh Mi Quest continues.....  Cos I got saiko'd.",
