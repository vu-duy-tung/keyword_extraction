    "text": "This lovely little cafe reminded me of the kinds of places I'd stumble upon on holiday in Italy; with the most delicious sandwiches and cakes on display at the countertop. And my salmon and cream cheese bagel was every bit as tasty as it looked.  I didn't stay long but just long enough to know that Cafe No.33 is somewhere that I can call on when I'm longing for a sandwich/bagel/coffee in a bright and welcoming spot.  Staff were friendly and service was fast. It's a tad small and if you do find yourself with the only option of the back two seats, they're just a little bit too close to the toilet door, which is a minor inconvenience. - But that's being pernickety. - I really enjoyed my visit to No.33!",

    "text": "Horrible. I ordered a cup of coffee. When it came to the table I let it sit a minute as it was very hot. As I was reading I smelled something awful. I wondered who ordered something gross. Then I smelled my coffee- gross- one sip- gross. It had the smell and taste of burned rotted meat. I brought this to the owners attention. His answer was that they use a very expensive coffee. No remedy offered. I left my undrunk coffee there. In my life I've never sent a cup of coffee back as I love coffee and am not fussy.",

    "text": "I'm a bit perplexed I didn't notice this place until today.  This little cafe has been open since December, which is news to me considering I walk past it almost daily. Maybe it's because it has a rather nondescript storefront or maybe it's because I walk and tweet too often to notice sweet little cafes right in front of my dang eyes, but today, while walking and tweeting, if I hadn't nearly ran into their sign out front, I daresay I would have missed it again.  I'm pretty glad that I didn't.  First and foremost, I tip the hat to free wifi. You'd think this would be pretty standard in most cafes by now but it's really not. So kudos for quickly jumping on the out of office office list for my work from home ways. Plus, the place has an airy, minimalistic feel with lots of natural light - perfect for those afternoons where I've seen the inside of my house and the front of a computer for far far too long.  But what's a decent wifi signal without good grub, so for the sake of \"research\", I had my second lunch today here. I ordered a salami & roasted tomato on focaccia sandwich and a custard tart to take away... because research should always include dessert.   The sandwich was tasty. Not a standout in any means but a solid, wouldn't kick it out of the kitchen sandwich. But where these folks won me was in their custard tarts. I already see an addiction taking root, which is dangerous as I already have a few pretty strong pastry addictions with other spots in the neighbourhood. The tart was delicious without being too sweet and I'd definitely suggest it.  I'll have to hold my comments on the coffee until my next trip in. I should probably have a custard tart with that too... you know, for comparison.  Cash only.",

    "text": "This isn't a place that really stands out when you walk through Stockbridge, though I think you'd be making a big mistake to miss it (as I have the past 7 months... oops!)  Coffee is quite good, and the Portuguese tarts are lovely. Pro tip: ask for it to be heated slightly before eating, in my youth I worked in a Portuguese bakery and there was nothing better than a fresh tart warm from the oven.  It's a cozy little place with limited seating. There's a small variety of other baked goods and sandwiches available too if you're in the mood for a snack or light lunch.",

    "text": "We popped in here for a slice a cake and ended up getting a yummy nata (Portuguese custard tart ) too!  It was a lovely sunny day in Edinburgh and by 3pm most cafes were sold out or had very limited choices of their pastries or cakes left (good for them ). This was the fourth place we had walked into (having not seen anything at the other places that stuck us) .  I ended up getting a delicious slice of a double layer maple and pecan cake. The icing was super sweet ( just as I like it) and the cake a bit crumbly because of the amount of butter in the cake. It was the 2nd to last piece left and the side was a bit dry (expected) but the flavour of the cake was so good and the icing so rich I wasn't put off by the dryness like I normally am! I would order it again because it was so tasty! PLUS it was a huge piece of cake! Could have easily of split it!    It's a small coffee shop with some fresh ready made sandwiches and wraps (a nice veggie section)  and some yummy cakes and tray bake choices.  A solid choice for a quick lunch or some cake and tea. It was clippers tea bags, nothing amazing but at least a good tea... though I wish they'd serve Pekoe Tea (just down the street) as some of the other cafes has chosen to do.   The BEST part of this little cafe were the Nata's , the Portuguese custard tart. If you have never had one of these you don't know what you'er missing out on! Probably my favourite part of visiting Portugal, are these amazing tarts! Each region makes them a bit different. Outside of Portugal its harder to find 'good' traditional tasting Nata's ( though I've seen cafes trying, more and more now). Cafe No 33 MAKES AMAZING Nata's! Delicious smooth custard and a wonderful buttery flaky pastry! Pop in for one of these if nothing else!!!!",

    "text": "At last a wee day off by myself and a stroll into Stockbridge for a wander brought me past this great spot. I'm always a bit nervous of trying somewhere new for coffee in case I'm disappointed but this place luckily was bang on! I ordered a toasted croissant with bacon, Isle of Mull cheddar, sun blush tomato and rocket which was awesome and toasted exactly as I like it! A creamy flat white coffee was the perfect companion, very nicely made and presented too. The cafe has a modern and continental feel, chilled and relaxed with a decent selection of tunes in the background. The staff were friendly and I noticed child friendly with fellow customers which was nice to see. I couldn't resist squeezing in a Portuguese tart and a tea before I left and I'm glad I did they were both delightful! Looking forward to stopping off here again soon. Only downside is the 50p charge for using credit and debit cards- slightly annoying but didn't ruin my experience.",
