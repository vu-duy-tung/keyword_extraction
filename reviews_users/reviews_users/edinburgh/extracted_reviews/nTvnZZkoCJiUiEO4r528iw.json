    "text": "When Jenny L told me that Kyloe was having a half priced steak \"sale\" if you will, I was in.  As an omnivore, I do love a good steak, and love it even more when it's half price.  My first note is that half price in Kyloe is normal price in my favourite steak house (I think I waxed poetic enough about Los Argentinos last night so I'll do my best to leave it out of the review).   My second note, is that Kyloe is much more centrally located than the place I'm leaving out of the review, and also has a wider array of menu options than unmentionable place of Argentinian persuasion.  Our waitress was lovely and had definitely had a lot of teaching about steaks.  We opted to get the full course on each bit of steak on the menu, where it came from, how best to cook it, etc.  It was very eye-opening and will definitely help next time I'm in the butcher's.  She definitely sold me on the steak board when she said that it featured cuts of steak that are not widely known and therefore are at times thrown out.    The steak board arrived on a warm slab of slate (ooo fancy) and each piece was explained to us.  Awesome.  The table favourite was the onglet, with the feather steak coming in second and the bavette coming in a (very) distant third, due to a funny flavour to be discussed later.  Each piece was apparently medium rare, except that they were all a bit *too* rare for me.  Much more on the rare side than the medium.    Jason M ordered what the rest of us were originally going to choose before going for the board, the sirloin.  It arrived a dull tan colour (not rich brown) and was practically cooked through.  Medium rare?  I think not.    As a side, I ordered the hand cut chips, Jason had the shoestring fries (they didn't appear all that shoestring to me...), Gillian had the onion rings and Jenny opted for the healthy choice of garlicy tomatoes.  My fries were neither here nor there and I felt that the onion rings were under seasoned and too greasy.  When we finished our meals we all reflected, in True Yelper style, on how we woule rate our experience.  We all enjoyed ourselves but that was more due to company than food.  The waitress was lovely though ultimately became a bit inattentive as I eventually had to go looking for someone to sort our bill.   This was of course compiled with the fact that my stomach was rumbling in an unhappy way at this stage (and still is), a fact that I'm not sure could be attributed to the odd tasting bavette or maybe to the rareness of the steaks.    If I'd paid full price, I wouldn't have been pleased. So, no repeat trips for me, I'm afraid.  I'll keep my steak eating to certain not-to-be named Argentinian steak houses, thankyouverymuch.  Oh, and the toilets were baltic.",

    "text": "I was planning to give Kyloe three stars as it's a nice place, but as I walked home I got more and more annoyed with myself for being too much of a wuss to send my steak back. I give myself one star as a customer for not speaking up, so let's split the difference and call it two stars. And you know what? If a steak restaurant can't cook a steak properly then they have no business being in business.  We were a group of four (see the other reviews on Yelp); three got the steak board and I had the sirloin. I do think the steak board is a great idea, a way of trying three different cuts that you don't normally see: feather, onglet and bavette. I was very tempted to get that, but I knew I could try Gillian's, so I went for the sirloin. I would normally get a fillet steak but we were there for their 50% January deal and only some steaks qualified (another minor annoyance, but hey ho).   So. The steak boards only come medium rare, because that's how the chef recommends cooking those cuts. I also ordered my sirloin medium rare. Now, I like to claim that consistency is the defence of a small mind, but one would think that as all the steaks were ordered medium rare, they should have come out the same. Not so! All the steak board cuts were cooked beautifully. Lovely seared dark brown on the outside and juicy red, even verging on rare, inside. Perfect. My supposedly medium rare sirloin was grey on the outside and in, with a thin section of very light pink in the middle. Lord knows how they managed to cook it right through without achieving any colour on the outside. It wasn't medium, it wasn't rare, it wasn't medium rare. I don't know what it was, but it wasn't a good steak.   So, sure, it was half price (=10), but to be honest, if I paid a tenner in a pub for a steak then I would expect something like that, or indeed better. In a specialty steak restaurant, this was unacceptable. They obviously thought so too because they forgot to deduct my 50% from the bill, until we notified the staff. Probably a mistake, but it really didn't help. Likewise (see Jen's review), the sides were all extra so the total does add up.  So yeah, nicely styled place (in a sort of 1980s bachelor chic, or maybe \"Gentleman's Club chic\" - lots of black and shiny things, but suited to their goal of being an upmarket steak house), has potential, the other menu options looked good, and the steak boards are a great idea and they do them well, but it could be much better. How you can bring four medium rare steaks to a table when one was clearly nothing like the others is a bit beyond me. I feel stupid for not complaining, but you shouldn't have to complain to get what you ordered. And that's why we have the internet! So like I said, I was edging towards three stars but . . . nope.",

    "text": "Kyloe! I'd been there before for a business lunch and really enjoyed my fillet steak (well, I wasn't paying).  So, when Jenny proposed we go for their half price steak, I was really keen. Apart from anything else, I wanted to take Jason there, as I thought he'd like it.   I really like the restaurant itself, with all its dark wood and cow-hide covered furniture. The serving staff are lovely and friendly, and really seem to know their stuff, explaining all the cuts and how best to cook them.   So we ordered - three 'steak boards' of unusual cuts, and one sirloin.   The steak boards were great - I loved tasting the different flavours, and confirming that onglet really is an amazing cut - I'd had it once before and raved about it. The meat was verging on rare, rather than medium, but I like that. The outside was charred and scrumptious, the inside deep red.   But. How could I enjoy it fully when Jason was sitting beside me with a pallid slab of overcooked grey sirloin? The moment it was put down we all just stared and said... \"oh\". I don't know how the waitress served it alongside those delicious steak boards without realising something was wrong!   As I've said before, we're both very British about complaining. What would you say? What would they do?  It should be right in the first place.   So I just fed him as much as I could spare of my own nice steak. Which wasn't a huge amount, I admit!   Ah well - it's too dear for us, anyway - the price of the steaks is bad enough, but once you add a couple of sides it gets a bit silly. So I'm glad I've tried it, but probably won't be back.",

Things that are a must on my Sunday roast list are - plenty of rare roast beef, crispy home cooked roasters, al dente veggies and of course lashings and lashings of gravy and I'm happy to say that Kyloe ticked all the boxes.. and then some!   Having met up with a group of likeminded yelpers this afternoon for a lazy lunch we only had one thing on our mind.... Sunday Roast! Taking Jen's advice on portion size we passed on a starter and jumped straight to the main event - and boy was it worth it! Each roast joint feeds four and it definately gets the tummy rumbling as you watch them carve each slice onto the plates before delivering oodles of fabulous veg, roasties and of course yorkie puds (unfortunately being gf I had to abstain) before topping it off with a fantastic gravy!! The meat was cooked to perfection, crisp on the outside but so pink and juicy inside and there was more than enough to go around as despite our best efforts (and believe me when I say we tried!) we still had leftovers... which if you ask they will kindly bag up to take home!   Desert was a large apple crumble - which looked amazing - tho again not gf so I was treated to my own special apple dessert comprising of pureed apple, cream, liquer topped with blackberries and decorated with dehydrated apple crisps which was very nice!   At 25 a head it's slightly more expensive than the 'chain' restaurants roasts but then again this is no 'chain' roast... The quality of the meat, the freshness of the veg, the huge portion sizes and accompanied by a lovely bottle of wine make this worth every penny!! Will definately be back again for more.... tho may need another few trips to the gym in the meantime!!",

I had the oysters, steak tartar and the mini sliders.  The second time was this past November and I had steak tartar (again) and the sirloin steak with a red wine and blue cheese sauce.  The steak was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and I absolutely enjoyed the blue cheese sauce.  I encountered excellent service on both of my visits.  If you join their mailing list you'll be kept up to date with their specials. For instance, for the month of January you can received 25% off your bill.  Definitely check this place out if you are keen for a well cooked steak with an beautiful view of the city from the West End.",

    "text": "I've eaten Sunday Roast dinner in several restaurants/pubs/bars over the years but Kyloe gave me the best Sunday Roast experience I have ever had. Previously I have encountered plasticy, thinly sliced beef which came with soggy cold veg drowned in watered-down gravy. But Kyloe beautifully presented a feast of the finest thick cut Scottish beef - sliced in front of you with platters of brightly coloured crunchy veggies and roast potatoes all of which were cooked to perfection and accompanied by bread sauce and a rich gravy, with wine to wash it down. I felt like a virgin - touched for the very first time. I'm pretty sure when we all took our first bite there was a chorus of moans followed by minor rolling of the eyes and silence for the most part of the meal while we savoured it which must be the quietest Yelp dinner I have been to. As much as we tried to, we couldn't polish off the last few bites - one must reserve room for dessert too you know. It's the only meal I have been to where a fight could have broken out over who got the doggy bag and much jealousy of who did get it. The suggestion was put to the group to reunite later that evening to meet and share what remained of the last supper but the doggy bag owner was having none of it.   I was thoroughly impressed by the quality of the the food and service and have seen it where I've paid more money for a meal just as good in a 5 star restaurant.  As for the cow themed decor placed amongst classy lighting and shades of brown leather - I thought this a little odd at first - maybe someone had a cow fetish but it dawned on me that Kyloe is a Steak Restaurant and Grill - Kyloe being a Scottish word for Highland beef cattle, so fair enough.  I am definately coming back here for more!",

    "text": "We went to Kyloe for our wedding anniversary recently and loved it. Will definitely go back at some point! My husband is a massive carnivore, so the suggestion of gourmet steak immediately got his attention, and he wasn't disappointed.  We immediately warmed to the place, as our waitress kindly gave us two glasses of champagne on the house upon finding out it was our anniversary (we were inquiring as to whether champagne goes with steak, and she suggested it probably didn't but we could always have a wee glass to begin.)  She then brought us out the platter of steak cuts and explained what each one was and how it was best cooked, and then recommended a steak based upon our own personal taste. I went for the 45 day aged Rump, which was DELICIOUS and cooked perfectly, although next time I'd probably go for something a bit smaller. I was too stuffed to fully enjoy my pudding.  The wine we chose was beautiful too, and the waitress again seemed to know all about it and whether it would suit our meal choice or not.  My only criticism was the cost of the side dishes - 4 for a bowl of beef dripping chips. They were so tasty, but not really worth 4 I would say.   On signing up to the newsletter you get a 20% off voucher for your first Kyloe experience, which made the cost of the meal much more reasonable, but I'm not sure how we'd feel paying full price next time. I guess we'll have to wait and see as we will be back at some stage!",

And their beef dripping chips may well have been the best chips I've ever tasted. There were eight of us and so, between us, we sampled a fair portion of the menu. We were all impressed with the quality of the food. The service was fantastic and I loved the way they showed us the various cuts of meat before we ordered.   But... the price lets it down. I was there in January when they had the \"50% off main meals\" promotion. Bargain! Or so I thought. Except that it turns out that a \"main meal\" is a steak with some watercress and a tomato. Hmmm... not really my idea of a main meal. All sides have to be ordered separately and were not included in the deal. And they are not cheap. Those beef dripping chips I mentioned - 4. Yes, 4 for a very small portion of (delicious-but-still-made-of-non-expensive-potato) chips. Because of the promotion, the overall bill was reasonable (though not the bargain I had first thought it would be) and, as I said, the food and service were both great. But I would think twice, and perhaps re-mortgage, before going there and paying full-price.",

I've never seen so much food on a plate in Edinburgh before, and it's a while since I've been this full but it was worth it. You need 4 or 5 people to do this meal justice as you get one big roast to share but this is a great way to spend a Sunday lunchtime.  It's a little bit expensive at full price for lunch but you get a lot for your pennies. Roast beef joint, roast tatties, roast veg, creamed cabbage, Yorkshire pudding, gravy, dessert, and a bottle of wine, and almost all very good (the wine wasn't quite as good as the rest but it was certainly drinkable). Mmmmm, just thinking about it is making me hungry. The decor's kind of weird, pictures of tripping cows and black marble toilets, and the view of the tramworks is lovely but it was comfortable and the service was good. I can't speak for their a la carte menu but I would definitely recommend the Sunday roast. As soon as I feel up to it I'll be back for more.",

I had heard great things about the service here, so that drew me in.   I had the beef carpaccio for my starter, and a nice glass of Malbec. The main I chose was the fillet steak with a side of creamed spinach. The steak was a nice cut, but a bit overcooked for medium. The creamed spinach was swimming in cream, almost like a soup.  For dessert I had the banana bread pudding. By far, the best dessert I've had in a long, long time. Light, fluffy, and just the right amount of chocolate.  Waitstaff were attentive, polished, and very polite. A welcome change from most UK restaurants.   The only major downside was the manager. She was unkempt, kept playing with her hair and then running food/drinks (yuck!), chewing on her nails, and her tattoo on her back was hanging out. Not that I have anything against tattoos, it just seemed a bit out of place for a restaurant with such a reputation to uphold. As a former waitress at a 4-star restaurant outside of boston, this was all a major turn-off and made me question the integrity and cleanliness of this place.",

Surroundings great - vegetarians probably wouldn't like the full on cowness but I loved the cow prints, cow hide furniture, barrels and cow ornaments.   However, for the roast experience and being gluten free, it wasn't great. Despite being warned in advance that there were two coeliacs in the party we saw/experienced errors galore. Gravy brought which wasn't gf. A gf option was brought after checking. The non-gf yorkshire puds were placed by staff on plates using utensils that then cut the beef and arrived on the same tray (and touching) so contamination potential galore. Even when we mentioned this, separate utensils were not used even though they could have used one set of utensils to do the puds as we had two roasts and therefore staff had two sets of utensils.  Dessert looked promising with a meringue top but the suspect base turned out to be wheaty based so non gf. Had we tucked in without asking (having now mentioned the gf thing multiple times by now), then two of us may have had an uncomfortable night. So it wasn't gf, we got offered ice cream, so not great.  So, a nice idea and could be executed well if more care taken over us gf people but not the best first impression for me.",

    "text": "We came to Kyloe last weekend for what was a fantastic Sunday lunch, one that I could safely say is one of the best I have had! Located at the far West end of Prince's Street, Kyloe is extremely central and basks below the castle with stunning views up at it. We sat upstairs in the spacious dining area and enjoyed these brilliant castle views throughout our meal, which definitely complemented and added to the experience. We had the traditional Sunday roast, which was absolutely delicious and extremely plentiful. Shared amongst four people, the roast is carved at the table and served with Yorkshire pudding while tatties, green veggies, and sweet root veggies were all served family-style. The meat was perfectly cooked and was some of the best I have had in a long time, and the wine complemented it well.  Even though we were quite full, we did not regret the dessert. The apple crumble was made even more delicious when served with vanilla ice cream and white chocolate. Wow, to say the least. It was amazing.  Even though 25 is a bit more than I would normally spend for a Sunday lunch, this was a fantastic treat and is fantastic for groups of four to indulge and enjoy an afternoon together taking in the trendy ambiance of  Kyloe.",

We got red wine and an apple crumble with custard and icecream and white chocolate flakes. The whole experience was a so good that I was about to fall into a post dinner snooze there and then.  Service was terrific and I am so glad we have a restaurant like that!   We went with fellow yelpers and this was organised by jenny. Hopefully we will join in a lot more.",

Reservations were tight - had to settle for 5:30 or 9:30 - but I went with 5:30 on the strength of recommendations. Service was inconsistent, with intervals of excellent service scattered among long periods of neglect. The actual food was fair to good, but far from extraordinary. In particular, the quality of the meat did not live up to my (overblown?) expectations of the legendary Scottish Angus beef. I'll try again. Elsewhere.",

    "text": "Simply Great !   I have visited this restaurant 6 times already without disappointment and a great meat experience!   I am a red meat lover, and I had trouble finding a good steak in Edinburgh until I found Kyloe.   A large variety of cuts and sizes to choose from, and every cut is juicy, tasty and very high quality.  I ordered the Fillet steak a few times and the 400g rump steak, both were served medium rare like in the books, nice and red in the middle and a thin cooked layer from the outside every time. The steaks were juicy and fantastically tasty! the sauces are good, especially the peppercorn and the blue cheese but i am yet to try the entire list, but i will defiantly get to it!  If you want, the list of meat cuts can be physically presented to you on a platter, for you to understand and choose what most appeals to you.  The chips were very good, crispy and tasty.   My girlfriend is not a fan of meat and she always takes the loch Etive mussels and she loves it. So if you have partners or friends that are not entirely keen on red meat, there are very nice other options.   The decoration is unique and chic especially the cow skin seats. At the same time It is also high standard and fancy giving a romantic/relaxed fine dining atmosphere. The windows overlook the lively West End of Edinburgh Princes Street which is very nice.  Staff are very professional and nice, they also immediately take your coats for you, and serve water to the table.   Order a table in advance, it is a very popular place.   Enjoy!",

Named after the scottish highland cattle, they took light in the fact with nice humorous decor.    The service was friendly and prompt. The drink menu was plenty with locals hanging out there for just that, but the dinner was wonderful. We had excellent steak on the board shared with my girl, nice sides of potato chips english style, onion rings and very good green beans, all spiced right. The meat cut was cooked as we requested and just the right amount and a good tender cut of beef. The bread on a board was a good lead for us with a scallop starter. All around us seemed to be happy with the excellent food.  For steak check this out and maybe even if you have the seafood steak need between a group.   Enjoy the view up on a nice view on the second floor over a prominent corner.  Enjoy Edinburgh!",

    "text": "Dear Kyloe,  I visited your fine dining establishment with a rather large group of people, all of us eager to feast on your fine selection of quality Scottish meats.  Having visited your restaurant twice, I have to say: I cannot praise your decorator, chef and waiting staff enough.   The restaurant has just the right vibe to it (location is a huge bonus), the meat is of superb quality and cooked to near perfection, and the waiting staff catered to our every need politely and efficiently. Plus, the meat platter. The meat platter is the funnest thing I have ever done in a steak house, and is tremendous help in deciding what cut one wants to go for. I cannot commend this enough. The price tag is of course hefty, but you get what you pay for - quality dining on the posher part of the city.  Now, I tried, but no matter how much I wanted to, I couldn't give you the whole five stars, and that is for two reasons.  Firstly, sides pricing. I am not into the seafood trade, but I think that a fiver is a little too much to ask for 3 extra prawns on a steak - let alone the 2 charge for 30 ml of peppercorn sauce, which is just absurd.  Secondly and most importantly, the mandatory service charge. I am just not getting this. I understand this is 'take-it-or-leave-it' restaurant policy, I am all for awarding good service (and I got plenty of this at Kyloe) and tipping is part of the UK restaurant culture, but how are you so sure that every waiter that has ever worked, or will ever work, for you, deserves a 10% service charge? How do you know that this is how much people rate the service they get? How have you come to the conclusion that every customer who eats at Kyloe has to tip your staff as much? It is presumptuous at best, and policy that should be reconsidered.  That said, that steak and that peanut butter & jelly cheesecake were worth every single penny.  Yours faithfully,  Nik",

Despite this joint's, perhaps overly passionate cow obsession, kyloe served me one of the best steaks I've ever had. It's not a place to come to if you are starving and want a huge chunk of meat, but it is a wonderfully tasty dinner filled with various flavors as there is a variety of cuts, rubs, marinades, and sides to choose from. Although our meal was a wee bit pricy, the food did, by no means disappoint, and I'm proud to say my short horn sirloin was awesome. Suggest coming here if you are visiting Edinburgh.",

We also had the Sunday roast here which was very enjoyable and tasty. At the time they had a pineapple tart dessert served with coconut ice cream which was fantastic. The pastry was freshly baked and crunchy, the pineapple was caramelised and sweet and paired well with the scoop of coconut ice cream. I haven't been here for a while but I would definitely return both for the steak and the roast.",

    "text": "Lazy long weekend off with my boyfriend, what better to do than go for steak?!  Itison had a voucher for Kyloe recently, sirloin and chips with a glass of wine for two for 29 - not bad! So off we trotted to Kyloe to eat our steak, having made sure to book in advance. Not that we probably needed to, as the restaurant was very quiet. However this did mean we got a pretty cool cowskin booth with a great view of Prince St!  Our wine serving size was on the mean side, probably due to being there on a voucher (as we saw someone else order a glass from the menu, much bigger!), but it was perfectly nice wine so we weren't too bothered. A jug of tap water too, which was refilled part way through without even needing to ask. The steak was lovely - verging more on medium-well done than medium as I'd asked but didn't bother me really as it was still very tender. Oh, and the chips were delicious too - small and chunky, and only a few of them, but actually it proved to be a perfect serving size, any more of the beef fat dripping lovelies and you'd start to feel a bit too full. Very good bearnaise too, perfectly seasoned (this cost an extra 2).  Because the restaurant was so quiet we were served very quickly and had finished in just under half an hour, though we drew this out at the end finishing wine/water to make it a more acceptable 45 minutes.  Needless to say we were impressed, although I'll hold off on a higher rating til I've been back to try more of the menu.",

The emergence of steak restaurants in Edinburgh has heightened competition in the city with Kyloe and Steak Edinburgh being the big dogs to date.  Kyloe has launched a fantastic Sunday roast option, 4 people, roast joint of your choosing, all the trimmings, a desert and a bottle of wine for 100. You do have to preorder, no last minute decisions unfortunately but it is a great idea.  The joint is brought to the table and carved in front of you, served with a large Yorkshire pudding. Cooked to medium the meat is of fantastic quality. The portions are huge and you need four very hungry mouths to get near to finishing the lot.  Deserts are homemade classics, on our visit it was apple crumble served with cream, we asked for ice cream additionally and this was no issue. I need my vanilla ice cream when having crumble, surely it's a law somewhere?  In any case the meal was superb and a visit come highly Jd Reommended!",

The waiter brought over cuts of steak to describe the cuts, where they came from and what is the best way to be cooked, Amazing. Staff freidnly and knowledgable. I had the ribeye, medium. With the rebwine blue cheese sauce was delisious. Easily cut and melted in the mouth. Although our ides and sauses had to be bough separately worth it.",

    "text": "I really, really wanted to love Kyloe. We had booked ahead of time for Hogmanay (in hindsight, we should have booked another night) and even put down a hefty deposit.  First the positives: I loved the look and feel of the restaurant. Booking ahead of time via email was pretty seamless. Some of the appetizers that came with the set menu were super yummy.  Honestly, I think my expectations were for a typical NY style steakhouse and this was very different and I should have known better.....  The low point of the meal was when the waiter came buy before even taking our drink orders and said \"Meat? Pink or not pink?\", implying there were only two ways to order your meat cooked, I guess. unfortunately, I was disappointed in the flavor or the steak, but didn't say anything...   the waiter helped us find our jackets which were on a massive hanger two feet from our table.... I turned around 5 seconds and realized I forgot my scarf at the table... I saw the waiter walking briskly with the scarf towards the back room without even attempting to look in our direction or return it (he had literally helped us find coats seconds before)..honestly, I don't blame him for not having a great view of Americans...",

The Chateaubriand to share for mains with mustard sauce, snap peas, hand cut chips all for sharing.   Now it's hard to impress me with steak as I believe I cook a mean steak myself. These guys did an excellent job.   Every part of the meal was memorable.  I have no hesitation recommending this venue.",

    "text": "Kyloe has style to spare. Now style is great if you're driving a sports car in a blizzard, or you're wearing a suit made out of bottle caps to a wedding reception, but it's only half the equation when it comes to a full dining experience. The rest comes from the food, and while Kyloe's kitchen cannot match the top-notch atmosphere its dining room and staff provide, this is still an essential place to grab a meal at in Edinburgh.  We were next door at The Caledonian and were coming off of days of walking, hiking and all manners of discovering the majesty of the Scottish countryside. Because I had gotten my exercise in for the year and did not feel like hoofing it through the streets of Edinburgh another night, I suggested hopping in to Kyloe. It ended up being a fantastic idea, as this is a place that can be as fancy or as casual as you want it to be.  The three of us walked up the stairway from the ground level as a poised hostess took us to our seat not too far from a window. Along the way, I noticed the cow paintings. The cartoon cows are a fun touch to the otherwise chic dining room - I spotted a Van Gogh, Warhol and Dali style parody, but there are probably more dotting the lush booths, tables and bars. (If Hieronymus Bosch has a parody here, that might be difficult to eat across from.)  Shortly after being seated, our server, Maralisa, greeted us. She was an absolute joy, helping point us in the right direction with some menu recommendations and walking us through an elaborate cut of meat presentation on an accompanying board that looked like it outweighed her. Our meal was enjoyable, well-paced and overall wonderful thanks to her service.  (Speaking of wonderful developments, this place has Hitachino Nest beer. Because I've probably wasted large chunks of my life wandering bars, liquor stores and breweries, I'm always impressed when I see Hitachino Nest for sale in places. By the time you read this, they may no longer offer it, but know that at one point they did serve bottles with red, cartoon owls on them!)  Food was the only slight bump in the road here. The bread before the meal was a perfect introduction to the meals to come, and the beef-and-bacon appetizer was almost as good. The prawn, shrimp and avocado cocktail appetizer was probably the best item before getting down to the business of devouring steaks big enough to make our Texas cattle blush.  Here's the problem: these were no Texas steaks. The ribeyes were delicious, sure, but I had a hard time willing myself to finish the dry-aged cut that started to feel like it was more than living up to its name the more I chewed it. Fortunately, side dishes were superb, with the smoked mac and cheese and garlic green beans definitely being great additions to the meal. And the parmesan gnocchi is a terrific alternative meal if steak is not your thing.  All in all, Kyloe is definitely a solid place to go for a date, a business dinner, a family meal or a round of drinks. The food may be a trifle bit inconsistent but should not be enough to dissuade you from giving Kyloe and its cow paintings a chance.",

Super attentive to our kids for dinner and they loved all of their food including their banana split.  Great wine and super cool atmosphere on the second floor.

    "text": "I've been to Kyloe a number of times, and it has always been very good - so good that I wouldn't rate it anything less than 4 stars. I do think it's worth more than 'just' 3 stars, maybe 3,5 stars.  Tempted by the 40% January offer, I decided to book a table for two on Friday night and was looking forward to some good steak.. The restaurant was full already at 6.30 pm so I guess we weren't the only ones making use of the offer.   We ordered our main courses: steak, chips and a butternut squash salad. I had the rump steak, cooked medium rare. It was cooked nicely, and the good bits of the steak were tender. However there were quite a few fatty and gristly bits. The salad was ok-ish, just too much dressing for my personal preference. The chips were amazing, but too salty for me. Again, perhaps just a matter of taste. Some like their chips saltier than others..  It was time to check out the dessert menu. Didn't want any but I asked the waiter if we could have some irish coffees. It wasn't on the list but they accepted my request and the coffees were brought with some complimentary chocolate truffles and sweets. I thought it was a nice touch.  All in all, a good experience but I've had better steak in Kyloe and elsewhere..",

I've had a look at other Kyloe reviews and I'l admit that as a gluten-loving male on expenses, I'm absolutely Kyloe's demographic, and I've been lucky enough not to witness the flies mentioned by other Yelpers. If you're in a similar boat, anything meat-y, medium-rare, bookended by complimentary, deliciously-fresh bread (with olive oil as an appetiser before, and for soaking up the last of the juices afterwards) make for one of my favourite restaurants on earth.",

    "text": "I had dinner here last Friday evening and didn't really have any expectations of the restaurant.  I normally find British speciality grills to be hit or miss, with miss becoming a more regular occurrence.  We arrived and were say down quickly. Happy with the table, but when I looked around I would have been happy at any of the tables. Nothing like a bad table to disrupt a pleasurable meal.  The waiter introduced several options and discussed with us the farms and different types of beef. I chose the sirloin on the bone  with a beer and chips. I probably could have gone the red wine and salad, but hey, some times you feel like steak, chips and a beer!  :)  The steak took about 30 minutes to cook and bring out, which was understandable given the size of the thing!  The steak was absolutely delicious ... To die for incredible. I only expect beef like this to come out of countries and restaurants in the States, South Africa or Argentina.  The service, was fantastic also, with the gentlemen serving us being attentive, courteous and knowledgeable.  I will make one small complaint, however it doesn't register enough for a drop in a star. An irritant I found was spending 50 on a steak and then being asked to pay 2 for a relatively small amount of sauce. I found this quite cheapening.",

    "text": "Meat eaters, be prepared to be wowed.  This place is lush and undeniably pricey but if you are looking for quality beef cuts which are insanely succulent and tasty then look no further. At the start of your meal, you will be asked to see the selection of cuts available, I would recommend you to go for it. It really helped us pick what to have for dinner, especially cause the waiter went through what cut taste better depending on how you like it cooked. Our table was greedy, we went for oysters to start with and charcuterie. Then 3 different sides (smokey Mac&cheese, onion rings and potato gratin) and our main which was a shared cote de boeuf and a sirloin steak. I loved all of it, the cote de boeuf being top of the chart. We then shared the red velvet cake to finish us off, I still dream of it! So yes I have gone on and on about how good the food was, the staff was equally as good, making every effort to make us have a special night by being very attentive and friendly. The only area we felt they could improve on was their mojitos, but given the fact the rest of the cocktails we had were nice, we will let them off with that. So yes, go try it. I doubt you'll be disappointed.",
