Palak Paneer (V) and Keema Sheema are worth keeping an eye out for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike. Rice is normally a better bet than the naan bread and the mango cheesecake is good.   It *is* a really small restaurant, everything is bit crowded and seating can be uneven, but don't let it put you off as youu'll never be rushed out.",

    "text": "As far as listing what's good about this place goes, I don't know where to start...  Recently opened on busy and bustling Nicolson Street, In Delhi is perfect for everything from meeting friends for coffee, to a full lunch, to simply wanting to try the mango cheesecake they advertise on the blackboard outside. I can say that much from personal experience!  What I love most about this place is that it stands out from all the other lunch/coffee places in this area of Edinburgh. The walls and menus are covered with Bollywood film covers, and the seats and ceiling are covered with bright coloured, sequinned drapes and throws. Whilst the bright colours might not sound very relaxing, the seats are bean-bag comfy and the low tables give the whole place an authentic yet informal atmosphere. The kitchen is all open-plan so you can see exactly how your food is being prepared.  I usually go for the spicy chicken roti wrap when I'm there, which just like the veggie and other meat rotis comes with 4 home-made salads, pickles and chutneys - which are always different every time you go.  For those less predictable than me, the counter is fit to burst with homemade pakoras, samosas and bhajis of various descriptions and fillings, which again are all served with the lovely sides.  The infamous mango cheesecake, whilst not as sweet as usual cheesecakes, was so more-ish I even thought about ordering a second piece.  No alcohol is served, but you couldn't ask for a bigger selection of soft drinks, ranging from the usual fizzy drinks you'd expect to the more exotic - my personal favourites are the Bundaberg Ginger Beer or the Rubicon Mango juice.  Don't miss... if you're a student, take your snapfax and get 50% discount on roti wraps and coffees.",

We had been admiring the mosque kitchen and thinking of giving it a go! my amigo pointed out a very True thing....it doesnt look very authentic! It looks like any cafe/restaurant that could be serving anything so on we went!  We saw Dehli and inspected the menu, cheap we thought and with him being a student on we went inside. As you go inside your eyes and other senses are assaulted. The vibrant decor, the smell of the food, the music and the bollywood madness on the screen transport you to another world away from the bustling world outside.  One thing we did notice immedietrly was the high number of Indian customers! There is a lot to be said we agreed for a restaurant if its a palce where the people of said country cuisine go to dine there!You kind of think ....yeah....this is going to be good!  After reviewing the menu we opted for the 14.95 sharing platter!!  After a reasonable wait we were not disappointed! What appeared before us was a rorating platter with different dishes!  - lovely fragrant rice - chipati and naans - chickpea curry, - spinach and potato dish (alak gook perhaps im not good with names) - chicken masala - badjis with cous cous and salad with yogurt sauce!!  Also included for this price were a juice, I had gauva juice! So damn goood!  Also included was a desert to share which was a mango cheesecake!! The base wasa very buttery shortcake, with a cream rich cake with pieces of mango through it topped and decorated with passionfruit, raspberry and mango purees! AMaaaaazing!  Jd - hugely happy man will be back here for sure!!",

It's listed as a tea house within the restaurant section and until i got in it didn't realise that it really was just a tea house that did food and not a restaurant that does tea.  Saying \"just a tea house\" is really selling it short, though. For 15 we got mixed plate of tons of starters, salad, 3 curries and drinks. It said it included a slice of cake or Indian sweets which we weren't offered but to be honest, we would have struggled to fit dessert in anyway.  As for the place itself, it's cosy and really decked out like an Indian tea tent. The Bollywood movies are highly entertaining but the Bhangra music can get a bit much.  Not enough to stop me going back, though!",

Gorgeous, cozy decor - bright hangings, comfy pillows thrown about, would really warm up a windy Edinburgh afternoon. Delicious food - tried the lamb samosas and chicken tikka masala and they were both great, generous portions as well - and the prices so sinfully low, I felt a bit criminal, like I was robbing the place. The service is very friendly and courteous and there's a great selection of teas. It'd be a lovely place to while away a rainy afternoon, sipping on tea and nibbling on poppadoms - if you can get a table, it gets quite busy, and rightfully so.",

    "text": "This is probably the main competitor of the mosque kitchen, serving cheap curry to hungry people. I would much rather eat here though.   10-to-10 succeeds in creating that tranquil hippy atmosphere, the interior is quite a world away from the freezer outside. Bollywood music, incense and colourful cushions and fabrics give the illusion that you're in some chai tent at Glastonbury festival. That's a good thing, by the way.   Whilst the mosque kitchen delivers vast quantities of food in a canteen-like set up, here you get table service, a menu, and somewhere comfortable to sit. Sure, the menu is limited, but it's not really that bad. You are not going to find a cheaper meal anywhere-lentil dahl and rice or naan for 3! It comes with a little salad and some couscous, which is a nice touch, considering how inexpensive it is. I also ask for extra spice with the lentil dahl, as without it, it can be a little on the mild side. Probably safer if they are making bulk quantities of one dish, as some people hate spice. I have also had the chickpeas a few times, and my boyfriend has tried the paneer. You can tell everything has been microwaved through, yet it was originally homemade, and this is the likely reality of most Indian restaurants. You would be waiting a lot longer if you really wanted them to make it from scratch especially for you, and you'd be paying more. The chai and mango cheesecake here also look interesting, though I haven't actually tried them so can't comment.  The service here is very friendly, but not in your face, which is quite refreshing.",

The interior is decked out in multi coloured cushions and drapes and scarves, which make you feel like an extra in a Bollywood film. This is added to by the fact they actually have Bollywood films playing in the background, sometimes a slight distraction but good fun nonetheless. Also if you want to brush up on your Hindi they have Indian books that you can have a nose in.   The food itself is excellent and refreshingly different from most other places in Edinburgh. It is a great mix of Indian and snacky food, like a more low key Mother India Cafe. They do excellent curries which can be put into a wrap (the roti wraps), definitely the highlight of the cafe, but there are also loads of other Indian style nibbles to try. These wraps, despite being reasonably priced to start with, are 20% off with a Snapfax.   They also have an excellent range of hot and cold drinks, including the Chai, which is amazing. This comes with a free little biscuity cakey type thingy which, although I am generally not a fan of cakes, was pretty good. The staff here are lovely and it is generally pretty cheap so definitely drop in for a great alternative to the standard sandwich bars that litter Edinburgh",

For one of their delicious chicken rotis meals, one could get away with paying 1.75! However, they've certainly gained popularity and increased the prices along the way. Don't take it the wrong way, their still quite cheap, and thankfully now making a profit on their meals, but I should still be allowed to grumble for the old days! The rotis are cheaper, still coming with a Snap fax discount, as well as a salad and a little side of delicious stewed chickpeas. It's also possible to buy a variety of snacks at the counter, my favourite being the pakora. For a more wholesome meal, they've got a nice variety of curries, and I very much recommend you try their Desi chai tea, which is spiced, sweet Indian tea which has a tendency to make me quite sleep each time I drink it. Having eaten at least fifteen roti's there (no joke) I especially love the charming and colourful Indian decor, the constant Bollywood movies playing on the flatscreen TV, and the Indian celebrity magazines they've got on hand for waiting customers!",

But, the small plates my girlfriend and I ordered were not great. We had the lamb samosa and the pakoras. Both were doused in the chana masala (which I actually ended up ordering for my main). Don't get me wrong, it tasted great, but it ruined the pakoras and the samosa. I could barely cut my samosa with a fork and knife, let alone pick it up. It was soggy and tough. Same goes for the pakoras. The pakoras and samosas that I have had at other authentic Indian restaurants are crispy and freshly fried. These tasted as if they had been fried a long time ago, reheated, and then had curry poured all over them. The spices were good, though. When I got my chana masala, I was very happy. It wasn't as spicy as I would have liked, but the flavor as good. Little greasy, but didn't bother me too much. My girlfriend meanwhile was very disappointed in her curry. She had the palak paneer. It wasn't spicy, didn't have much cheese or spinach in it, and tasted inexplicably sweet? All in all, this place wasn't as good as I remembered it when I ate here a few years ago, but would definitely come back for the chana masala and friendly service.",

    "text": "I was very excited to eat here--quirky atmosphere with beautiful cloth hanging from every wall (even though that's probably a fire hazard), and some super cheap channa masala that I thought tasted fabulous; unfortunately, I didn't have that same opinion when it passed through my gullet a second time. A mere six hours after eating here, I threw it all back up. It didn't last long, but I still felt horrible for a few hours. I know it was this place that gave me food poisoning, probably from some bad cream or yogurt in the sauce. Not hard to believe since my whole meal set me back less than 7. Long story short? Good, nice atmosphere, and a price that's actually too good to be True. Hopefully what happened to me doesn't happen to you.",

The portion of non veg meal (curry, pakora, chick peas and half garlic naan) is sufficient for one person. It was delicious and you will crave for more indeed !! It is recommended for people who like mild indian food!! It's very reasonably priced for UK and you can be full in less than 8 pounds. What adds to your entire experience is the amazing decor!!   Tip.. During fringe festival be prepared to wait!!",

They have a well-priced selection of curries and cuisine for students, which makes it a doubly-attractive spot. Plus it's right on Nicolson St.  I had the veggie curry, and it was just the right size portion, with a little hill of rice and portion of curry. It's not spicy at all though, so if you want something with heat, maybe try a different dish! I've been told they also have excellent mango cheesecake--so I'll just have to go back to get that another time!",

The curry is very flavourful, the naan bread just the right amount of garlicky, the rice is lovely and a refreshing little side of fresh salad and couscous comes on your plate. Portions are the perfect size, enough to not make you feel like you'd want more, but not so much that it's a struggle.  Yummy, comforting food that doesn't leave you feeling over-stuffed.  The staff are lovely as well, very efficient and up for a wee chat.   What more could you want? Love it! (I'd give it 5 stars if they gave the toilet a bit of a re-furb.)",

They also have tasty options for vegetarians (my vegetarian roommate loves it here). For dessert, I always get their mango cheesecake... which... I'm salivating now just thinking about it. It's wonderful. If you go here, you must get the mango cheesecake! The decor is beautiful as well, with colorful drapes covering every square inch of the walls. I wish they had a larger selection of dishes, but the selection they do have is tasty!

The interior decor feels stylish and cosy with plenty of pictures and ornaments to make you feel like you've stepped into India.   The menu is extensive, with plenty of authentic Indian dishes, only some of which I had actually heard of before.  I went for the tandoori lamb kebabs which were delicious, spicy and served with really fresh salad.  It came in a nice, big portion and cost only about 6.50.

Offering a basic selection of curries at good value (4) it feels a bit mean to point out the curries themselves are very mild, obviously this is to cater to the widest audience possible but it left me craving another (spicier) curry.   The decor is much as early Holywood pictured a sultan's harem, the smells are at least in part from incense (at a guess nag champa), all in all for me 10-to-10 in Delhi is trying too hard.

And a can of diet coke was a pound. I'm so glad that's how they roll, I hate it when places charge you 2.25 for wee glass of draught pepsi, or a wee bottle of coke.

There is a small counter at the back of the shop selling traditional Indian food as well as hot and chilled drinks. 10 to 10 in Delhi use authentic Indian terms on their menu when listing the food. They have a range of dishes available such as pakora's and samosas and there is an impressive selection of vegetarian meals available too.

    "text": "This cafe looks nothing on the outside like it looks on the inside. Which is probably why it took me so long to get to it. In Delhi's on Nicolson street, which is a pretty busy street, as far as Edinburgh's concerned (though it's no Princes Street), so the bustle of people always seemed to keep it well hidden. The outside is white with scrawling letters, and it has two large windows that show a whole bunch of colourful drapes on the walls, and similarly colourful pillows on the seats. I can't really decide whether it's tacky and overwhelming, or quite comforting. The pillows are definitely comfortable, in any case.  They serve a variety of Indian cuisine, as well as lassis, juice (passion fruit, lychee and more!), delicious chai and coffees. I had a desi coffee when I was there, which was FULL of cinnamon (always a good sign). The food's normally less than a fiver, and you get a pretty good, filling amount. Around the cafe, and inside the bathroom there are loads of magazine photos of Indian stars and they show music videos on a small TV.    I definitely recommend going in for a desi coffee (if you're a fan of cinnamon) and a vanilla flavoured chai if you're around the area and want to get away from the sirens and bustle of buses and cars on Nicolson street.",

The food is absolutely incredible for the measly price you pay (around 5 pounds).  Based on the presentation and volume of food (even the volume of meat), you'd deem the cuisine both fancy and aesthetic. However, you get a casual ambiance that makes you feel at home while you're able to enjoy a large and delicious meal.  Service is quite impressive given the small work staff and lack of walking room in the restaurant (only downside I can think of is the small size of the restaurant, you'll be in close proximities of others around you). Service is friendly and genuine.   I'd caution on the safe side when choosing spice level. If you're normally a medium person, I'd order in between a mild and medium (I fall in this category). Finally, bring cash since they do not accept card. You guys will thank me later for the obligation to come here.",

I wasn't expecting much, seeing as I was on a budget and insisted on paying as little as possible for dinner that night, so with that in mind, I was quite satisfied with what I was served here!  First things first, this place is so colourful. It's like you've stepped into a unicorn's cave, seriously! Absolutely adore the cozy but vibrant interior! It's small though so expect a wee squeeze.  I got a simple Dhal (medium spiciness) with half garlic naan which is only 4quid. The portion was huge! Wow! That's alotta dhal! But yeah it was simple and pretty good. Very filling and the spiciness kept me warm for the next few hours, which was perfect! :-)   I'd like to highlight the amazingly friendly staff members! The waiter/counter guy was super smiley and cracked jokes every time he spoke to me! And the cook also chatted with me when he served me my meal! Bunch of friendly people makes it feel very homey!  If I lived in Edinburgh, I think I'd be here all the time, just to relax and sip on some chai. It's a very nice place for food and just chillin' with friends. Definitely student friendly as it doesn't burn holes in your wallet!",

It's really a nice place to be. Although I didn't try any on this occasion, I was also impressed by the selection of sweet treats and cakes on offer. These would certainly go down well with a nice tea or coffee.  Recommended!",

The best part most dishes are under 5! Now usually when I go there I don't pay over 4 for a dish!   There's usually space for two but it does get crowded. But luckily now thy do Deliveroo!!   If you're a student they have a great little student menu. With yummy dishes.",

    "text": "I went to this place a few times back in 2014, when I was living in the city, and it was always excellent. I just finished a meal there tonight, and it was nowhere near as good as I recall.  We started with the lamb samosa and the pakoras; though it mentioned the chana masala with these starters on the menu, both dishes were drowned in it. This is not a typical presentation for these starters, which I wouldn't have minded had the bases of the dishes (the samosa and the pakoras) been done correctly. Instead, they were soggy all the way through, indicating that they were both wet from the sauce and weren't fried to order (and trust me, they weren't--that kitchen is tiny and I could see the microwave being used). The food was hot enough, but the texture of the pakoras was mushy instead of crispy and the dough on the samosa was tough to cut. That being said, the spices were good on both of the starters.  For entrees we ordered the chana masala with rice and the palak paneer with naan. My girlfriend really enjoyed her chana masala, and the flavor of it was pretty good. Her rice came out very hot (steaming), which I always appreciate.  My palak paneer, on the other hand, was not at all what I expected. The dish that came out was brownish-red, not the typical green you see with this dish, given that it's supposed to be made almost entirely of spinach, cream, and various spices. It was beyond sweet for what the dish should be; I've seen recipes with a small amount of sugar in them to counteract the bitterness of the spinach, but never so much that it tastes as sweet as chana masala, which it did. Nowhere in it could I taste coriander or any of the other sharp, biting flavors of India that I love so much. Not to mention the menu states that you should choose how spicy you want your dish, and our waitress didn't ask (though she was otherwise very sweet). My naan was also incredibly rubbery; there is absolutely no way it was toasted in the oven before being brought to the table. Most likely, it hit the microwave first, just like everything else.  Overall, an insult to my memories of this place from a few years back. I don't know if the chef has lost his fire, but it's certainly not to be found in the food.",

I'll have say a little more. - What a sweet little Indian cavern; so authentic and a real treat to be found in the city. The decor is so bright and uplifting. However, for me, the hustle and bustle of chatter at the staff counter and snippets of loud football chat detracted from the calming interior especially considering how small the cafe is. Though, I found staff to be warm and charming and the service was fast.  I will be back to uncover more of 10-to-10 In Delhi's delights as this was a quick visit with a Mango lassi on my mind. - I can't wait to try their chai!  And, of course, mmmm, mmmm, mmmmmango lassi.",

The location is umongst that of the university students and lecturers that are heading into get there lunch. This sport just hits the mark with its mixed meat thali. The amazing decor and attitude towards its food really makes you feel as if you have been transferred into the sub continent of India.  The dish itself is full of flavours that make you salivate on the palette and crave more of the cooking. Will certainly be looking to return upon our return to Edinburgh.",

There are lots of other good Indian restaurants like Dishum if you really want to check out Indian dishes.  I will never go this place again and won;t recommend to others.",

Cosy is the first word that comes to mind, the place is tiny, but beautifully decorated with wall hangings and there is colour everywhere. It only has a few tables, but thankfully I've never had a problem getting a seat.  If you're looking for an Indian Restaurant that serves curries and all the trimmings, then this isn't for you; if you're looking for somewhere that serves everyday authentic Indian food, then get here pronto! My particular favourite is the chicken roti roll, with copious amounts of chai, but everything I've ever tried has been lovely! While I've never had it, friends have raved about the mango cheesecake.  It's cheap, it's certainly cheerful (there's often Bollywood movies playing in the background) and the food is great. What's not to love?!",

Perfect amount of flavor, spice, and portions. Started with the vegetable samosa which ended up being extremely filling as it comes with a side of chickpeas, small salad, and scoop of cous cous. More than I expected that on my second visit I ordered the same, added a side of rice and called it a meal. During my first visit I also had the lentils and rice. I'm used to ordering yellow lentils but found their red lentils more pureed than solid, but still flavorful. Second and third visit consisted of enjoyed their cheesecakes. Just get it, trust me.   Service: treated me like we've know each other for years. I definitely didn't feel like a visitor and of course contributed to the many reasons why I returned. I was informed after my meal they only accepted cash. After feeling embarrassed, their trust allowed for me to disappear for a while while searching for cash. They greeted me back with a smile...that's where strangers became best friends!   Affordability:  A++++  Tips: chat it up with the staff, CASH ONLY, go back again, and again....and again.",

I left with that queasy feeling after eating fatty foods and didn't bother taking away any remainder..  Which says a lot coming from someone who doesn't like wasting food!  Was very busy so perhaps good for others.",
