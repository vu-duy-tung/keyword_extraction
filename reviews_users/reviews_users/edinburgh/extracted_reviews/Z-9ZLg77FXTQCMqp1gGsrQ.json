Not only is the meat cooked really well, you get a good range of vegies also cooked really well. Can't remember anything on the menu being over a tenner which was surprising considering the quality of the food. Drinks are slightly higher priced than what i like to pay but overall it's a great little place. (also should mention they have a projector going for the big football matches too)",

But the food. My god THE FOOD! I got eggs benedict with hash brown and loved it so much I even ordered more hash browns afterward. My friends got the steak burger, more eggs benedict, and pancakes with bacon. After significant sampling, I can assuredly say that everything was absolute perfection.  The service was good but it did take a while for the food to come. It also seemed longer because I was so excited. Another reviewer was right, this is the best brunch in Edinburgh's West End, and it was easily the best brunch I've had in the city.",

    "text": "\"The Capital\" cocktail is life. So good. You wouldn't expect to like it, necessarily (unless you are a serious cocktail connoisseur), because it is listed on their cocktail menu under \"sour\" which is the style of cocktail it is. Rest assured that if you enjoy a well-balanced cocktail that this fits the bill. Expertly shaken to a frothy foam perfection, the vanilla vodka, sour strawberry, marshmallow syrup concoction will not disappoint. You'll want to order other drinks like the lemonade-reminiscent \"Betty's Martini\", or the classic \"Maritime Punch\" (dangerously delicious), but you'll find yourself ordering \"The Capital\" for its intoxicating strawberry magic.   Keep up the good work and be sure to stop by their sister cocktail bars across the road and in Leith!",

    "text": "We came in late one evening and decided to order a few small plates/sides.  We shared the cauliflower gratin; corned beef hash the mac & cheese and sticky toffee pudding.  The cauliflower and the mac & cheese were excellent - really tasty.  The corned beef hash (or perhaps it was corned beef on mash come to think of it) wasn't good.  The corned beef had been pureed to almost a sauce and it did not taste nice.  The sticky toffee pudding was good - not as sticky as I would have liked, but decent.  The restaurant is very nicely decorated and the service we received was very good.  I probably would have given this place 4 stars, but whilst my wife was drinking cocktails I ordered a sparkling/fizzy water (not out of a bottle or anything just from the soft drinks tap) and was charged 2.50 which really seemed out of order given how much food we ordered and that my wife was ordering cocktails.  Perhaps there could be some discount/deal on soft drinks if you are ordering food & alcohol?",

After a disappointing experience at another nearby cocktail bar we decided to stop into this adorable bistro/bar to see if we could turn our night around. It did indeed! The lady needed a Manhattan to right her ship and I, being the genius that I am, ordered the Botanist Bloom. Delicious, refreshing, creative...perfect. Like I said it's an adorable space and a cozy place for a cocktail. Only hiccup we experienced was it seemed the bartender was training a new young lady(who honestly didn't appear to be of drinking age) and when our drinks were ready she promptly delivered them to someone elses table. The tender was quick to notice the mix up and had replacements for us lickety split.",

They are now only reasonably prices, but still a tad expensive. Service is good and the tenders at the bar well trained. They now offer contactless payment, which is actually very convenient. An extra star as i am now able to afford the beer prices without complaining too much. This is more down to my personal wealth than their offering, but it allowed me to soak in the atmosphere more, as i wasn't inwardly grumbling how i felt being ripped off. It is a nice bar, i may go as far as recommending it... perhaps.",

    "text": "the west end of edinburgh is sort of like unchartered territory for me.  i pass through every now and then but i never stay for too long.  however, it was a beautiful sunny monday lunch time and the boy and i needed to grab a bite before heading to the cinema.  having been to the west room once for a quick drink i suggested we go for lunch.  on entering we were welcomed by friendly wait staff who offered us any table as it was monday and not very busy.  there are some cool tall turquiose arm chairs near the bar but sadly these were taken so we headed to the main dining area and grabbed a table that was in the sunshine coming through the window.  the menu isn't huge but has a good selection of bistro classics.  there is fish and chips, caesar salad, burgers, and a nice selection of sandwiches.  i opted for a rare roast beef and horseradish sandwich that came with handcut chips.  i added a grey goose le fizz as it was sunny and afternoon cocktails are the best!  the boy got the pulled pork sandwich with a mug of the fish chowder to accompany it.  food arrived shortly after my drink (which was lovely and refreshing sort of like a lemon drop!) and did not disappoint.  my rare roast beef sandwich was lovely with a good slathering of horseradish on the bun that made it really tasty.  the hand cut chips were good although i prefer mine a wee bit more crispy.  the bite i had of the pulled pork sandwich was also really nice so overall everything was quite tasty and made a satisfying lunch.  i think what's great about this place is it's not too pricey.  had we not opted to have a few drinks the sandwiches would have only cost us 6.50 each which is a pretty good deal for a freshly made meal.  as this is the centre of town though drinks are a wee bit pricey, the cheapest being 6.50 so this added a bit to the bill.  however, for a nice ambiance, good food, and friendly staff i was happy to pay the price.  i definitely will be back here to try some more cocktails when the sun is shining again :)",

    "text": "Maybe I was having an off night on Friday?    Aaaages ago, a friend told me that there's a bartender in Edinburgh who knows how to make a Periodista, and that he works in the West Room.  The combination of that and the fact that I'd walked by here a number of times and thought it looked good, brought me here when I fled Ryan's Bar on Friday.    My thinking was that, even if they didn't know how to make the drink, surely they would then ask how to make it and have a stab at it, right?  That has been my experience in the past, but unfortunately was not my experience here.  I get that it was a Friday night, but they weren't that busy and I thought that was proper etiquette for a cocktail bar.  So, the lack of cocktail paired with the non-interest in attempting to make it put me off.    We got a couple of beers and, interested in getting some food, headed to the food area in the back only to learn that the tables were booked.  Well that's really completely fair enough for a Friday, but they very kind waitress actually came and found us when a table opened up and invited us to sit down.  Unfortunately by that time we were on our way out the door, but I did appreciate her effort.  All in all, The West Room just ended up being one more watering hole in the west end, and didn't really offer anything particularly special to warrant going out of my way for a return visit.",

It is one of those places that evolves over the day moving subtly from coffee in the morning through brunch, lunch and dinner right through to late night drinks. It's not a big place but well designed with long tables at the front for groups, smaller tables at the back for two's or three's and then a bar area in the middle. But the best bit about the design are the enormous lampshades that provide a colorful, artistic vibe to the place. The menu is locally-sourced, British gastro pub in style and tastes great! On my recent visit, I was just sampling the wine list and with help from the very friendly bar staff, I settled on a Shiraz that turned into two or three glasses it was that good. So this is definitely a place to check out if you're in the West End, anytime of day!",

They have a fab deal on, 20% off food from the a la carte menu.

The house white was lovely too, and the whole meal was under 30 with coffees so I was pretty impressed with the value.

Breakfasts are wonderful and Sunday lunch is great  But on weekday lunch I recommend  The burgers are moist and fresh and are accompanied by a pot of swish chunky seasoned chips. The best meal however has to be the fish and chips served with mini pickled onion and chefs special sauce delivered in paper. The fish is sooo white and the batter melts mmmmm me hungry.",
