    "text": "This place was recommended by a friend who knows his curries so I was very keen to give it a go. It's a very simple menu of a few curries (chicken, lamb or vegie) with rice, seekh kebabs, naan bread and a few other basic options. It's all served with disposable plates and spoons too so you can see it's not 'fine dining' but that's not the reason you'd come here. The food is great and comes in very generous portions especially considering the prices are so cheap. I can normally eat quite a lot but a chicken curry with rice, naan and a seekh kebab was more than i could handle (with a bottle of pepsi - all for 7!!).",

This wonderfully friendly kitchen serves some of the most mouth-watering curries I have ever had, and certainly the cheapest: 3 for rice or naan and a generous helping of curry. It's also vegetarian friendly. Salad and pakora are available, and the curries are generally a choice of veg, lamb (my favourite!) or chicken. There is also a wonderfully exotic selection of fruit drinks - last time I was there I had a can of sugarcane juice! Despite the wonderful food, the Mosque Kitchen has no airs of grandeur: the crockerry is disposable and everyone sits outside under awnings at picnic benches. There's a real community feel about it, with a wide range of age groups and backgrounds, children welcomed!",

They serve a great range of vegetarian dishes and meat curries with rice or naan bread on the side. The tables and chairs proved are outside under a large canopy, all of which you will have to share with the resident pigeons.

I do enjoy the relatively slack prices, the coppers in my battered leather wallet more than making up the cost for most of this venue's suppers. HOWEVER, when my compadre and I purchased a doner kebab each here (two desired might I add), and were asked to wait 15 minutes for said kebabs' deliverance, we were mightily disappointed to get home to one kebab that was CHICKEN and only one constituted of the meat of the DONER. Furthermore, the doner kebab was riddled with olives that looked somewhat like rusty screws, and snow-capped with a vile green chilli. Also, the doner meat was not often thinly sliced as a connoisseur such as myself desires, instead coming in weighty chunks of seasoned lamb flesh which I did not enjoy particularly. Conclusively, I'm afraid this unfortunate misservice has acted to the detriment of my overall assessment. I cannot however much fault the quality of the naan, which was a pleasure and will remain so 'til the last days of this world. Yours, Algernon Wilhale (Connoisseur of Kebabs) xox",

I don't normally go for vegetarian dishes when I eat out but I like their vegetarian selection so much that I'd order no meat (don't get me wrong, their meats are great). My only complaint is that they keep using plastic plates and bowls even after moving indoor! It's not very environment-friendly and I hope that they'd change to biodegradable paper plate/bowls if they want to stick with disposable cutlery. UPDATED: I would have given the Mosque Kitchen four stars if the doner kabab sold in the take-away section wasn't that aweful. Like I said, the restaurant is really good. But I'm SO disappointed of their take-away service. First, the customer service was very poor. The man who served was quite impolite to say the least. Second, the quality of the doner kabab sold in the take-away section was extremely poor comparing to the restaurant food. The meat was cold and the salad was not fresh. Forget about the take-away and go straight to the restaurant. I am a loyal customer of the Mosque but to be honest I am very disappointed of their take-away food.",

    "text": "The Mosque Kitchen saved my life. While not literally. But this summer when I was dead broke and had no cooking facilities at my apartment it saved me from a life of tedium and a raw-food diet. The Mosque Kitchen is hidden away on Potterrow. It is as it says: a kitchen and a cafeteria style set-up. You pick from one of a few menu choices which all come to under a fiver. There's kebabs, and vegetarian as well as omnivorous curry options. Naan bread and rice. All. For. Under. A. Fiver. This makes the Mosque Kitchen extremely popular amongst students- for good reason. Demographic-wise, I would wager that if you did a marketing survey of the people seated under the circus like tent in the pavillion, utilitarian 'dining room', you'd find it wasn't just students that the Kitchen is popular with. And this comes down to three equally important reasons: 1) The food is good. It is. It's yum. 2) The food is plentiful- which is as important as #1, really, isn't it- when you're hungry? 3) The price. Did I mention the price? The funds go towards the mosque which also feels quite fulfilling- instead of to a corporation. There is also, and I debated putting this as a bullet point in and of itself- the privilege, I see it (caffeine-fiend) of getting your Coca Cola in a glass bottle- yum! And that too is also cheap- cheaper than buying a can at a corner shop- but this, I remind you, is an eatery where its de rigeur to jack up the prices. None of that here. There are multiple leftist political posters as well as community event listings that hang on a bulletin board and the atmosphere seems to be wholly one of pacifism- except for the attitude towards the pigeons. Do not, under any circumstances feed the pigeons. There are signs. Obey them.",

The setting itself is pleasant enough and what you should expect for the kitchen of a mosque.   Staff were friendly and polite.   I think, however, I've been spoiled by visits to many \"Curry Cafes\" in London, Birmingham, Stoke and Manchester.   In those places, often with very humble surroundings, I've experienced food that is comparatively priced or cheaper and far more flavoursome.   I generally prefer visiting establishments like this to a la carte restaurants as I like to imagine the experience is more authentic for an everyday man like me.  The search will continue for me, however, for a comparable Curry Cafe in Edinburgh / Scotland to that which I've experienced before.",

Then the mosque decided to open the kitchen of theirs under the name 'The original mosque kitchen' Since I've always gone to the mosque I know that the brain behind the menu and the kitchen staff moved along to the Mosque Kitchen. So out of curtsy to the first kitchen I have since they moved gone to eat there.   I went once and tried the food here at The Original Mosque Kitchen and didn't really enjoy it and continued to go to the first one.  Then yesterday when I saw that people was reviewing the two kitchens under the same name I felt this had to be sorted but more important for me I decided to take off my curtsy jacket and try it again with open heart and free mind. So here is my review.  One thing is for sure that the terrace here is very charming and I love the feeling of sitting sheltered from the rain and enjoy food outside. They might not me the original kitchen but it is a very original place.  The staff is so welcoming and nice and I get happy just entering the kitchen to order food.    The menu is just the same with option of lamb curry, chicken curry, barbecue chicken, grilled lamb shish, spinach mix, lentil sauce, chickpea sauce, vegetable stew and rice for all dishes.  The price is amazing, I had lamb curry with rice and lentil sauce and paid 5.50 including a tropical juice. WOW!  The portions are massive and one has to ask to get less if not to hungry and wish to respect food.  The lamb was a bit dry, but the flavours of the sauce, lentil and rice was absolutely delicious and I loved it. I have to say that if I add the over all experience it is a clear 4 star. If the meat wasn't dry it would have been a 5 star.  So next will be to try the Mosque Kitchen and decide with a fresh mind where I will go from now on.",

Mediocre portions, staff not terribly friendly, chicken curry not that great, chicken tikka masala slightly better. Rice was sub-standard. Prices reasonable for what you get. Atmosphere rates 2 stars. I wouldn't recommend, nor return.",

Adequate cheap'n'cheerful option. Self-service. Large portions of spicy food served in plastic dishes. Limited choice. Basic furniture. Friendly staff. The Mosque Kitchin is fiine for filling up fast but if you want a meal nicely served with proper plates and cutlery, there are quite a few other restaurants in the area that offer that for only a pound or so more.",

I agree with the above comment about the plastic dishware. I know it's cheap, but I think they can do better! I'm sure I will be frequenting this establishment (especially as I just had to drop a bundle on housing!) I also agree with the above comment that this is not where you take people out. Nope, this is where you tuck-in for lunch or dinner, and perhaps eat one too many kababs, and it's cheap, easy and tasty.",

The only problem I had with it was the cold, it can be quite breezy sitting there but, needless to say, a curry always heats you up.

    "text": "Serving delicious authentic halal curries in massive portions for less than a fiver, it is no surprise that the Mosque Kitchen is very popular with students and in-the-know locals in addition to actual mosque-goers.   The entrance is on an alley off West Nicholson Street and you have to put up with sitting in less than comfortable surroundings. However the speed of the service, the size of the portions and the bargainous price make this an excellent place to grab a quick and hearty lunch or early dinner. Curries come with vegetables, chicken or lamb with rice, naan and salads available in addition to a selection of pakoras.   Make sure you avoid prayer times as there's no service but this rarely lasts more than 20 minutes, and why not pop into the mosque to check out the exhibition on Islam that is often hosted here?",

However, the reason why so many students flock there of an evening are the tasty, cheap and filling meals from the Mosque Kitchen.   My flatmate has been telling me for weeks how wonderful it is, so last night I went along with him and checked it out. He was so right - its possible to get a large plate of meaty curry and rice (although the kitchen also specialises in vegetarian fare) for only three quid. Take some friends along, hang out at the outdoor tables and tuck in to the best value meals in the city.",

I've spent a total of almost two solid years living or travelling around India, and just love all sorts of curry. This place has it down to a tee.   Even if the prices have started creeping up, it's still cheap, and still large enough to share between two of us for a lunch. You can understand the dissapearance of the Freedom cola too, when you see that they now sell little pots of perfume - to go with your meal? or for afterwards, maybe.   Its just great though - i can't wait for lunch tomorrow so i can go back!",
