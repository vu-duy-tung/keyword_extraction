    "text": "We had a table of 8. We made a reservation online. It was slightly difficult to navigate the reservation portal. It was confusing because the portal seemed to allow bar seating only.   2 of our party are coeliacs and required gluten free meals. They were very knowledgeable and accommodating. Lucy, our server was charming and she answered all our questions and asked the kitchen when she was unsure about the answers.   The meals were delicious. I recommend the bacon and chive mash!  My kids couldn't steal mine fast enough. My beef skirt was tender and moist, the haggis was very tasty, the chicken was nicely roasted and we had few leftovers. They do not provide takeaway boxes so come prepared or finish your meal completely.   Would definitely recommend Makar!",

The vegetarian sausage (\"swirlies\") served over the cheese and chive mashers was delicious! Will definitely be back the next time we are in the area!",

    "text": "True to their words, their food is fantastic. Just try their Chicken called Bonnie Prince Char Grilled Chicken in whisky, peppercorn & mustard sauce. This chicken dish recipe has been handed for centuries. It's so moist and tasty. One of the best chicken I ever had and with mashed potatoes so nice and smooth.  And if you like lamb. Try there Braised Lamb shank slow cooked in rosemary, red wine & cranberries. They are very good specially in a cold weather like here in Scotland.  If you have sweet tooth like me. Try there Sticky Toffee pudding with butterscotch sauce, served with vanilla ice cream. Try to order one of each not a share one because you might end up fighting.  A comfort food that you will enjoy after walking around the touristy area in Edinburgh.",

    "text": "The best meal I had during my stay in Edinburgh.   Started off with ordering a pint of the Belhaven Black (a nice Scottish alternative to Guinness). I was very impressed with the stout's smoothness.  The menu has a nice selection of entrees but the highlight is the meats and non-meats that you can pair with a nice array of mashes. I went with the Braised Ox Cheek and paired it with the Spring Onion & Crispy Smoked Bacon Mash. The meat was incredibly tender and the mash was a perfect compliment to it.  For dessert I had their Toffee Pudding. It was the right amount of sweet and was a great finish to the already stellar meal.  On top of the quality food, the service was tremendous. The staff on hand for dinner (Tina, Jamie, and Christina) were very kind and helpful.  A must for dinner in Edinburgh.",

    "text": "Loved this place. Went with the kids at the end of a long day exploring Edinburgh hoping for some great Scottish food. Service was great, the food was delicious and the kids loved it too. We loved all the options for different kinds of mashed potatoes that went along with the main courses. None of us had ever tried haggis before but it was really good here. The sticky toffee pudding with butterscotch sauce with ice cream was the perfect way to end the day. Great portion size and good value for the money (the kids portion was huge). Would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for great food in Edinburgh!",

We ordered the Smoked Sausage & Mash, the Aubergine Rosti Fritters, and the Haggis sampler. My boyfriend loved the Smoked Sausage, and the Aubergine Fritters were delicious! I was nervous to try haggis as an American who had never had it, but it was surprisingly really good. All in all, this restaurant has a friendly atmosphere, kind and attentive wait staff, and comfort food worth remembering. Thanks for the great dining experience!",
