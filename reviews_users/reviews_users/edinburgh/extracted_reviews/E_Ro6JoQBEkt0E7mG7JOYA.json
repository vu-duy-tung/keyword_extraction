    "text": "Kimmy's Takeaway is the definition of a greasy spoon cafe and it serves it's purpose rather well. They have a great selection of beverages, snacks and cakes and if you're looking for something on the go then this isn't a bad shout.  The prices are very reasonable indeed. Teas and coffees are as little as 60p, baked potatoes start from 2.00, a roll and bacon is 1.60 and soup is a mere 1.  In addition to this they also cater for the kids too with a slush puppy machine, crisps and a lot of yummy looking chocolate cakes.",

We were all hanging pretty badly and needed some serious food to waken us up and make us right.  Thankfully we came across this place which provides tasty breakfast rolls for only 2.  I went for the bacon and egg which wasn't actually on the menu, yet they still charged the same price for it.   They took virtually no time to serve us and we all left satisfied, well fed and markedly better than we had ten minutes before.  The service is quick, pleasant and served about ten people while we were in, testament to how popular this place is.",

    "text": "Kimmy's is a good wee greasy spoon takeaway, selling everything from breakfast rolls to quick fix lunches.  It's fairly small, but that's ideal if you're just passing through. You can't fail to spot the colourful special offer stars spotted all over the window, and its homely, cosy exterior gives you an idea of what you're going to get - friendly, efficient service and something to heat you up.  It's no frills comfort food at its best and refreshingly free of shockingly pretentious prices. Uptown they place a 2 tax on a bacon roll based on the surroundings. It's nice to visit somewhere that offers seriously affordable and perfectly decent food. Perfect for some stodgy warmth on a cold, dull day.",

It's actually criminally cheap. You feel like you have to tip a fiver to even things out.  Staff didn't even shoot me any evil looks as I nursed my cup of tea for a half hour before ordering food. Exactly what I want!!",
