    "text": "The Deli is welcoming and friendly cafe situated on Morningside Road.  Its name is slightly misleading as it is not necessarily a delicatessen.  It probably does most its trade through selling filled rolls, sandwiches and hot drinks.  The interior decor is clean and the bright colours on the wall create a bright atmosphere.   At the front counter the service is efficient and they have an impressive range of ingredients for sandwich fillings as well as a variety of different breads and baguettes.  I had cajun chicken and salad in a nice crispy baguette with a packet of cheese and onion crisps.  It tasted great but it was also quite pricey as it came to about 3.50 for what was essentially just a sandwich and a bag of crisps.   I can't dispute the quality of this place, however, and The Deli offers fresh ingredients, an extensive range of food and drink and great service to match.",

    "text": "An excellent little sandwich shop serving freshly made sandwiches on a variety of different breads and with a wide selection of fillings. There is a menu to help you decide and give inspiration, however you are quite welcome to choose your own fillings too. Prices are what you'd expect for a city - around 2-3 for a filled ciabatta - but the service is generally fast and with a smile! The Deli also serves a small selection of drinks, soup and cakes & biscuits. There is a bench in the front window and some stools for those who wish to eat in. Overall, very friendly staff and great service has kept this place going for a good few years now in an area with a high turnover of eateries.",
