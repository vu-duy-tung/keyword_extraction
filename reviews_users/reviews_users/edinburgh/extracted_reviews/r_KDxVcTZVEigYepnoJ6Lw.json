    "text": "Just off Commercial Street on Sandport Street, Domenico's does quite simply the best takeaway sandwich in Edinburgh. This tiny deli-cum-cafe is massively popular with office workers in the Shore area and the queue at lunchtimes is usually onto the street but it is well worth the wait every time. You choose your roll then select from a mouth-watering range of sandwich options or invent your own from the staggering array of ingredients in front of you. The black olive pesto is particularly good but it's pretty hard to go wrong. There are also a few tables if you want to eat in and when you do the food is equally amazing. Book a table or you've little chance of even getting in the door.",

    "text": "Four of us (two adults and two children) hit upon Domenico's by chance for a late lunch when travelling through Leith. We ate in - as the last reviewer says they have a few tables inside (maybe 40 covers) and some outside - which weren't an option for us in Leith between Christmas & New Year! The lunch was excellent, the service superb - they managed to maintain an authentic Italian atmosphere despite the fact that most of the time we were the only ones there! 3 of us had pasta off the lunchtime menu - an excellent choice and all with just the right balance of ingredients. The children had been warned about the spice in the spicy sausage and asparagus and it certainly was spicy and authentic. The fourth meal was off the lunchtime special menu - seafood provinciale. This was great food and great value with mussels, squid, king prawns and a crayfish in a fishy, rich tomatoey sauce. We only managed two puddings - a mango sorbet which was full of flavour and an excellent home made tiramasu. Puddings had generous portions and were brought with extra spoons to share. The only downside we found was the toilets - not large enough to satisfy the female members of our party! We thought this was excellent value for this quality of food - 46 including drinks for the 4 of us -and will certainly be back.",

The restaurant is small but doesn't feel cramped, and it's so sweet inside. It's designed and decorated with charm.   The food was great. We ate a brie and mushroom bruschetta, the ricotta and asparagus tortelloni, and a linguine with their house tomato sauce, which wasn't on the menu but prepared special at our request. The food tasted fresh and delicious and portions were large. We were delighted.   The staff was also very attentive, sweet, and accommodating. They brought me tiramisu with a birthday candle and sang happy birthday to me along with my mom.   I left feeling content and grateful. Thank you Cafe Domenico!",

    "text": "Leith is no stranger to good eats of all varieties, and Cafe Domenico is another in a long list of restaurants that has solidified my opinion of the district being a culinary headquarters for the city.  Cafe Domenico is set up in a tiny building off Commercial Street that is easy to miss unless you are looking for it. Don't let the outside fool you though. The interior is intimate without being cramped. Italian decor fills the walls without feeling cheesy. They've really managed to capture the spirit of a Roman trattoria with a low key setting and simple menu.  Brittany A. and I stopped by about an hour and a half before closing on a Wednesday night. The cafe was fairly packed at the time, but we were seated instantly. The staff are very cordial and will go out of their way to make you comfortable, including checking your coat. The menu is composed of several pasta dishes, some mains, sides, and desserts. Some of the dishes are classic Italian, while others infuse a Scottish twist. Ever tried veal and haggis pasta? They also run a few daily specials. From Monday through Wednesday night the cafe offers a pasta dish and a glass of wine for only 8.50. I couldn't resist such a deal, while Brittany opted for the lasagna on special for 10. We both split a starter of their mozzarella garlic bread, which uses panini pressed Italian bread covered in garlic, butter, and melted mozzarella atop a bed of rocket.   When our mains arrived I could not believe how huge the portion was, since the menu stated that the pasta special included a 'small' portion. My dish was composed of a large bowl of penne pasta, covered in a pesto creme sauce with a head of broccoli and spinach thrown in. I asked for a heap of freshly grated cheese and pepper thrown in for good measure. The pasta was perfectly cooked, and the creme sauce delicate and flavourful. I was so stuffed that I did not get a chance to sample their tasty looking desserts.  Cafe Domenico is what the UK needs more of - a humble, family run eatery that knows its customers like family and creatively adapts a cuisine to its locale.",

I'm so horrible that I don't even want to listen to myself go on about it, which is why I rarely bother to try Italian restaurants in the UK at all. But when other people suggest a friendly meet-up at one, I try not to be a jerk about it, so I just show up with a smile. Which explains how I ended up at Domenico one evening. Lucky for me, because it was an utterly charming experience. The service was personable, welcoming, and accommodating. The food was, well, pretty good. Pasta cooked correctly. Good house wine at a reasonable price. Decent grappa.   I would go again. This is high praise, I assure you.",

From the start the waiter was talkative and friendly, offering us dishes not on the menu. When he mistakenly described the special as also coming with king prawns he promised that he could have it made that way especially for us. The chef also stopped by the table a couple of times to joke with us and ask how the meal was going.  I was tempted by the pasta + wine special for 7.90, but I couldn't resist the Seafood Stew based on Blythe's recommendation. The stew was overflowing with fresh mussels and fish for 15. I'm not a big fan of salmon, so I was pleased that the stew had a rich variety of flavors, including a nicely smoked whitefish. The broth was tasty, but when I went to sop it up with the accompanying bread I was disappointed. The bread fell apart in my hands and had a wholegrain taste that didn't match the rest of the food.  For dessert I tried the Tiramisu and Banoffee pie. Both were fine, but nothing exciting.",

Having lived and worked in Leith in the past Domenicos is close to my heart, from their daily lunchtime specialis to the focaccia sandwiches they have always been at hand with a taste of Italy.   So as to last night, 8 hungry Yelpers deceneded looking for a comforting meal on a cold night. From the minute you walk in the door Tony greets you like a long lost friend. His hospitality is second to none. I was running erm rather late for dinner so instructed Caz to order on my behalf. Having been given 3 options I went for the seafood stew....it was a good choice.  As a starter we were given a selection of anti-pasti - cheese...meats....ccheeeeese, roasted veg.....lovely.  To my fish stew - mussels, salmon, squid, haddock...smoked haddock all in a lovely broth. With bread on the side for mopping this was a very enjoyable dish. The mussels and the smoked fish were particularly tasty.   For desert I initially ordered the tiramisu - as it seemed I was getting the last one I agreed to share with Scott so we both got half tiramisu/ half banoffee pie. Nice enough and washed down with a lemoncello even better :)",

The staff were friendly though and happy to have a look about to see what they had left.   I went for a 'mexican' sandwich off the specials board. Freshly cooked (I assume) breadcrumbed chicken, salsa, guacamole, rocket, jalapenos, and no doubt some other things I can't remember. All the ingredients were great, from the bread to the rocket and especially the chicken. The combination worked really well too, it's good to get something that has had a bit of thought put into the flavours rather than just chucked together.  All in all a great visit, and cheap too for what I got. I'll certainly be returning a bit earlier next time and maybe sometime to try the restaurant/cafe for a sit in meal.",

    "text": "wednesday night found me merrily skipping my way from the bus stop to the warm lights of this restaurant that i have been desperate to try for ages!!  i was so excited, as the only reviews i'd ever heard about cafe domenicos could be summed up with the word AMAZING.  opening the door i was first greeted by one of my lovely night out companions sitting down followed by the handsome waiter asking if i would like my coat hung up.  so with a good looking man providing the service, the evening was already off to a great start!  our third companion for the night came along shortly after and we deliberated over the menus.  the first thing i noticed about the menu was how concise it was.  about 6 starters, 6 pasta dishes, and 4-5 main courses and a handful of specials.  even with limited options though i still found it rather difficult to make my choice!  after a bit of debate and discussion with the waiter we ordered the fig and blue cheese bruschetta, a tomato, mozarella, and pesto bruschetta, spicy sausage and red pepper pasta (extra chilli and garlic), auberigne and tomato pasta, and pesto, spinach, and broccoli pasta.  just a note, they offer a deal monday thru wednesday for a pasta dish and a glass of wine for 7.50.  they kindly subsituted my glass of wine for a diet coke as i wasn't drinking that night.   The bruschettas took a bit of time to arrive as the waiter made them all fresh, but they were definitely worth the wait.  each toasted piece of fresh bread was topped high with tasty ingredients accompanied by a sizeable portion of rocket and tomato salad dressed with olive oil.  both bruschettas were very good but i have to say the figs with blue cheese was just delicious!  the combination of the sweet fig with the salty slightly pungent blue cheese and the crispy bread was like bruschetta heaven in my mouth....  pastas arrived in an appropriate time after our starters had been cleared and for 7.50 (including the drink) these were very good portions!!  my plate held a very pleasing meal of spinach and broccoli with penne pasta mixed through with fresh pesto and just a hint of cream to bring it all together.  topped with parmesan, i very happily ate the lot because it was so tasty and comforting.  my fellow companions also found their dishes very tasty and we were even paid a visit by the chef to see how our dinners were.  as we had a movie to go to and decided to get some cinema treats, we didn't get dessert although there were a few tasty options on the menu.  the waiter kindly brought the cheque and was happy to accept three forms of payment as well.    i was very impressed with cafe domenico and felt that it completely lived up to expectations and i'm looking forward to going back already!  the excellent customer service and their willingness to tailor dishes or make them up specific to a diner's need was a really nice touch.  not too mention how delicious and fresh the food is and the excellent value for money, seriously can this place do anything wrong?  perhaps as i'm desperate to get lunch there as both my friends raved about the quality of the sandwiches, but working many miles away from leith will not allow such luxuries.  maybe they could set up a delivery service???",
