    "text": "I popped into Tapame with a group after work and was pleasantly surprised.  The menu is small but with lots of variety, and all the dishes we ordered as a table were delicious - I particularly enjoyed the pulled pork pitta and the patatas were easily large enough for two to share. As with all tapas, some of the dishes do seem a little overpriced, but when you consider that you'll end up sharing everything it works out as pretty affordable - I paid 17 for two small glasses of wine, a starter and two mains.  I'm surprised that others had issues with the service - our waiters were both really attentive and seemed knowledgeable about the dishes on offer, although the restaurant was pretty quiet.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend checking Tapame out, although I'll likely be waiting a while due to the limited menu.",

    "text": "Whilst I reckon there are better tapas places in Edinburgh this is the only tapas/Greek combination I'm aware of and the dessert I finished up with last week was fantastically indulgent so it gains marks for that.  The service throughout was attentive and informative when it came to questions about the ingredients etc. and the range of dishes available is good an varied.  You're probably best not sitting by the windows on cold days though as the height of the place means it's a struggle keep it evenly heated (which was probably the case in it's previous incarnation too).",

    "text": "it was after 8pm on a thursday evening and i along with fellow book club members were full of wine, beer, infatuation with jilly cooper, and the need for some food.  being in the uni area, we were directed towards Tapame for a delightful tapa dinner.  i was told this place used to be favourit, which i'd never visited but the refurb looks lovely.  it's a good sized space with exposed brick walls and a chic sort of interior.  i was a bit tipsy perhaps, so my memory of the venue may be the tiniest bit hazy.  however the wait staff were absolutely lovely and showed us to a table at the back of the restuarant.  we ordered a number of tapas between the four of us and a bottle of wine.  it's worth mentioning that the bottle of wine was 11 and more than drinkable, so excellent value for quality!  tapas arrived fairly quickly and we all tucked in.  my favourite were the sliced potatoes topped with some greek cheese and the meatballs.  we also had a massive cheeseboard, chickpeas with spinach and pancetta, a type of beef dish, tortilla, and breads with dips.  it was a feast for sure and all the dishes were just as tasty as the next!!  what really stands out about this place though is the wait staff.  they are lovely and there without being intrusive!  when they thought we'd dropped cutlery on the floor the waitress was over with a new set within seconds.  however it was unneeded until i did actually drop my knife on the floor and she was swiftly there to replace it.  the price is also right, paying about 13 each for wine and a really good selection of tapas between 4 people.  if i'm in this part of town and needing dinner i will definitely be heading to Tapame again!",

    "text": "The food, when it arrived, was pretty good. However, the service was really crap. When we walked in we were seated at a table near the open door. We shortly realized there was a freezing draft near the door (it was a bone chilling 13 degrees out (in the middle of August) ), and asked if they would close the door. We were told it was not possible, as the open door was keeping the kitchen cool. Then we asked if we could move to an empty table in the back, and were told yes, but then immediately \"no\", because a table of 5 had just walked in. So we stayed put and ordered, jackets and sweaters on. Then for nearly 30 minutes, almost no food arrived (after 15 minutes one dish of the 7 we had ordered did arrive), all while we watched the table of 5 in the back get served everything they ordered and complete their meal.  We finally inquired of the manager, who explained to us that A) there had been a rush just before we arrived so the kitchen was behind and, in explanation of why the people after us had been served, that B) they had children and had requested quick service in order to be within the legal requirement to leave the restaurant at 10 PM. However, at the moment she told us this, it was only 9:25! Even while she was standing there talking to us the other table was already gathering their things to leave. Finally, in drips and drabs, the food came out. As I said, we enjoyed the food overall (though the red pepper appetizer was a joke: a tiny smear of spread on the plate, accompanied by two toasts: they would have been better off serving them as crostini with the smear on top. At least the presentation might have fooled us.) On the other hand, I'm sure none of us will return or recommend it to friends. The restaurant has been open for far too long now for the service to be that bad. Sorry.",
