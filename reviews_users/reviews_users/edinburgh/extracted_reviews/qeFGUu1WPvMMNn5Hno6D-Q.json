I enjoy Whisky, but am by no means an expert. I always ask for recommendations and am never disappointed. The bar tenders will help you select a Whisky that suits your taste and will tell you the story behind it.   Definitely recommend this place for someone who wants to explore Whisky and get some good Scottish food to soak it up.",

They had a great selection of beer and wine, along with some specialty cocktails.  I ordered the steak and ale pie which was lovely.  The steak was incredibly tender and the topping was flaky and light.  My friend ordered the Whiski burger, which I tasted, and also fell in love with.  You get hearty portions, good quality food, and great music to listen to.  For dessert we ordered some of their award winning ice cream which was delicious and also light.  I recommend coming here, as they also do have a great selection of whiskey! If you are very hungry do not go on the weekend as it gets very packed and the service is a bit slow.",

Serving up a mixture of pub grub and traditional Scots dishes (like cullen skink), Whiski blends contemporary decor with a traditional feel.  As the previous reviewers have said, it is quite a synthesized representation of the Scots pub, and it feels as though its existence is based on what tourists it can lure in. Nevertheless, I can imagine it would be quite charming to people travelling through Edinburgh, so it gets four stars from me since I can see its appeal to international guests. And when all is said and done, there's a good selection of booze behind the bar and well cooked food, so it's pleasant and popular with passer's by!",

They have scotch flights available, which is a nice touch if you want to sample a variety. Not being a scotch drinker myself, I had a wonderful few glasses of the Thistle Cross apple cider which they have on tap and it's wonderful. Much much much better than the sickly sweet Bulmers everywhere else. My husband had a great time talking to the bartenders to identify really peaty scotches to drink, and they were very helpful in pointing him to new things to try. We had chips with cheese as a snack - they were standard good but a rather small serving size.",

I had the steak and ale pie which is a modern deconstructed version. The flavors are so rich and creamy and the best thing about getting it their way is the pie crust is super flaky.   The mussels are great too. They come thru with a huge amount of mussels. Probably 30 or more?  The bangers and mash were some of the best bangers. The meat in the middle is so juicy and spiced with mustard seeds and other tasty flavors which simply made my day.  If you're a large group try calling ahead and booking the back room during the week. On the weekend though its first come first serve which makes it near impossible if you're more than 4 people trying to walk up at dinner time.  Cheers",

Their whiskey list was two full Excel spreadsheets with every type of whiskey you've ever known and then some. The service was nice, too. If you're looking for a hard-to-find scotch, they probably have it.",

The crowd skewed mostly older but there were several incredibly attractive and well dressed women in their 30's here when we stopped in.  There was a folk guitar band playing, which was a little too mellow for our tastes. The selection of whiskeys though was phenomenal, and the bartenders were very skilled. The whiskey sour and hot toddy were particularly good! It's a very upscale and classy place.  The bathrooms were clean, and had a goofy condom dispenser that sold \"Whiskey Flavored Condoms\". We got a good laugh out of that, especially the fine print \"Do not Use While Driving\".  Good place to stop for a meal and a warm-up drink before heading out for the clubs.",

I'd noted another spot that would have been a good mile walk down the way but the driving rain and cozy exterior beckoned us in.  One side of the restaurant is a whiskey shop. Impressive array of different types of whiskies - I had no idea or interest as I am not well-refined in the whiskey world. If you are DEFINITELY stop in or shop here. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.whiskishop.com%2F&s=6de756f56b3e493d33b50cbb7ad4121b27f1b9fe64fb9a67d059f096b22d534d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">whiskishop.com</a>.   We both went with specials. I had the starter and main combo of raw Scottish salmon with a frisee salad and creme fraiche, followed by crayfish linguine. Yum!  The salmon was fab, especially when dragged through the creme, followed with a bite of fresh-baked crusty bread. The pasta was lovely as well. Flavorful and cooked al dente with oil, peas and the star - crayfish. Yum. Most UK restaurants have some sort of starter/main special and I highly recommend going this route when possible as you will get a nice variety for your dosh.  Man had the Gambon ham and egg special with chips. Gorgeous plating. Egg cooked to perfection so the yolk slowly spilled out over the ham. Chips - awwww!  Why can't we get chips this good at home. Thick-sliced but not soggy or under/over done. Crisp and hot. Made with love. So delectable that ketchup is superfluous.  Nice price point and very pretty interior. Comfy banquette seating - try to get next to the window to people-watch. Staff were sweet and made sure our coffees and waters were filled. If it hadn't of been morning with a full itinerary ahead, I definitely would have sampled some whiskey.  Last note. One of the other Yelpers mentioned the cutesy spelling - it almost threw us off as well but the downpour helped settle our minds quickly.",

The burger with haggis, onions, tomato relish, and bacon was great. We had never tried haggis before. I imagined I wasn't going to like it because American food tv shows made it sound so awful!! It was delicious and really made the burger pop. I wasn't in love with the actual burger patty, but all the toppings were so good it made up for the patty being too tightly packed. The fish and chips were also very tasty. We didn't drink anything, but it appeared to have a large selection of local beer and whiskey drinks to enjoy.",

The place was quite busy, and is obviously popular with locals as well as us tourists.  After notifying one of the employees we'd like to wait for a table, we sidled up to the bar for a round of drinks.  There were a couple of parties waiting ahead of us, and a couple more parties waiting behind us.  To the credit of the waitress, she kept all our groups in sequence and seated each group promptly as a table opened up.  Food was very good pub food, much better than the standard greasy Brit pub food.  Our group had the salmon, a burger, and a couple orders of steak & ale pie...not to mention a few more drinks.  All the food was great, and the portions very generous.  I'm a pretty good eater, and was unable to finish my own meal.  We ended up staying past our meal to see the live band who started playing about 10pm.  They were a local group of Scots playing American bluegrass music.  I'm not a particular fan of bluegrass, but this band was still pretty enjoyable.  Throughout our experience at the Whiski, have to give special compliments to our waitress Chloe, she was awesome!  Took very good care of us, friendly, and made us feel at home.",

The salmon was fantastic.  I also enjoyed one of their many preset whisky flights.  Service was good and everyone was friendly.  I was still obsessing over the salmon the next day when a friend made it to town so I took him there and had it yet again! Plus a different whisky flight because, well, it's Scotland!",

I was seated at a table near the door, which I didn't mind because a cool breeze would come in whenever someone opens the door and it was kind of stuffy inside!  It took a little wait before the waitress came around to take my order, but from my experience, it was within expected window of time in Edinburgh.  FOOD/DRINK- of course I had to try the haggis tower! But I ordered the vegetarian version since I had fried haggis the night before. Wow! I was so pleasantly surprised that it was delicious (since its veggie)! It looks like a dessert and was quite filling. I was only able to eat about half. The cookies on it were a bit hard though. The non-alcoholic bottled drink (passion fruit/pear?) I had was refreshing. Wished I came with a friend of two, then I could've tried more food!  AMBIENCE/SERVICE- cozy, well decorated with signs and with a wall shelf full of booze. Tables are small, but cozy in a good way. Noise level was average. Waitress was very nice and friendly. Food came out quickly and hot. And I felt very welcomed and appreciated.   Overall, I had a pleasant experience here and really liked the food. I would recommend this spot for drinks and food for solo travelers, couple for dates, AND groups!",

Great whisky, the little writeup that came with the flight was very informative, and it wasn't too overpriced for the tasting. Food was a little lacking though, my steak and ale pie had about 4 cubes of beef in it, and the pie was a tiny puff pastry on top that didn't really match.

The bartenders are very knowledgeable (Tamara was awesome) about the different kinds of whisky so if you are not sure which one you want, just ask and they will recommend one. The food is also excellent like the steak sandwich. In the three days we were in Edinburgh we were there four times. Looking forward to going back again.",

Our server last night, Morgan, was a little shy about her wealth of knowledge at first, but once we got her going she had all kinds of great advice about her favorite whiskies & flights and how to drink them to get the best experience. Our food was great too- typical fish & chips and a haggis dish that both had excellent flavor and came out piping hot. Today we both enjoyed coffee with whisky and shared some decadent sticky toffee pudding. And by \"shared\" I mean that we fought over every last bite.  We stayed a little longer for the music- a fun little quartet that sat down at a table and played some great traditional songs after a few pints. It looks like they have live music of some sort almost every night of the week! This place has a great atmosphere and awesome welcoming vibes by the staff. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "inconsistent service, consistently mediocre food   My friend and I wanted to try some Scottish food after a long day of sight-seeing and chose WHISKI after hearing that they had live music. Unfortunately, they didn't have live music the day we went, which was a tad disappointing but admittedly, our fault.   We found the service extremely inconsistent; on entering the busy establishment, a cold waitress told us that she wasn't sure how long we would have to wait or if we would even be seated before closing time! We waited by the bar and talked to a more sympathetic bartender regarding her whisky recommendations, and she estimated a 30-40 minute wait. After a few minutes, another friendlier server talked to us and seated us immediately, to our confusion.   The best thing I can say about the food was that it was filling. We ordered the haggis tower as our main and the fish cakes and cullen skink as starters. The haggis tower and fish cakes weren't terrible, but the cullen skink tasted like an extremely dilute clam chowder almost to the point of salty water. In terms of ambience, WHISKI has a typical pub atmosphere, with wooden interiors, dim lighting, and loud chattering.   I would suggest checking WHISKI's live music schedule if that interests you, but otherwise, I probably wouldn't recommend WHISKI.",

The food is great quality and rich with flavor. It was our first intro to haggis and we had them in spring roll form and it was fantastic. Wow! I had no idea I would like it so much. Great flavors! The saltiness of the haggis paired perfectly with the sweet plum sauce. The Cullen Skink was a hearty and smoky haddock soup. Mmmm. Definitely grab this traditional dish! The steak and ale pie was great looking and my friend enjoyed it thoroughly. The whisky drinks were top notch! I could have had the Monkey Kilt all night. I can't wait to bring this recipe back stateside. We liked this place so much for dinner we came back here the same night for a night cap. The place is also warm and inviting and warms the soul on a chilly day. So happy we found this place.",

    "text": "While The Whisky was supposed to be the one place we 'just had' to visit in Edinburgh, I wish we had skipped it.  It was crowded, which I actually enjoy in a pub-style  restaurant.  It was also quite unique in the large variety of Scotch flights available, though I am not a  Scotch drinker, others in my group enjoyed it  The dinner menu was good but lacked anything for the smaller appetite, especially when considering appetizers in advance.  The food was delicious, but here is why I can only give 2 stars (and that is generous!)  As I mentioned, it is an evening, starters to dessert and coffee.  I wanted to enjoy everything to get the full Scottish experience, even if it is pricey.  By the time my delicious burger arrived, I could barely eat more than just a few bites. The burger was 22 and reckoning it might make a great middle of the night snack, I asked for a takeaway container and the waitress seemed appalled and said 'NO!'  She proceeded to look down her nose at me with a bit of contempt and tried to take my plate. I told her I would keep it a bit longer and she rolled her eyes and rushed off.  We sat a bit longer and I could feel the waitress staring at me from behind, just waiting and watching for me to figure a way to take the burger with me. At that point, she said it was against the law for me to take food (which I paid a lot for) away from the restaurant.  I don't like wasting food or money and I especially do NOT like being treated like an idiot.  I did wrap the burger up and left it sitting on the table deliberately.  If I'd had a pen and paper I would have written a note of some sort to her, but alas I did not. If I  could have, the note would have asked her if this is how she would like to see her mother or sister or friend treated in public. Would she appreciate it if someone she held close was utterly and completely humiliated in front of not only family but the entire restaurant.  I work in the service industry, but in commercial aviation.  If this were to happen on my aircraft it would be the last day of that individual's career with my airline.  I would make sure that a proper apology was made to the guest and suggest a different career path  Our bill was close to 600.  That was not even close to what it cost for ruining the rest of my trip to Edinburgh.  Enough said. I will never return to The Whiskey and probably not to Edinburgh, either.  Save your money for a place that sincerely VALUES its guests and treats each with care and respect Delete review",

    "text": "I was in Edinburgh for the day - intersecting with several college friends of mine who had flown in from all over the world for our 25-year reunion - before heading for a week of whisky-tasting in Speyside.   The day we all arrived coincided with the fabulous Fringe Festival (a different review for that!), so we all went to Old Town Edinburgh to check out the scene and try some haggis. After striking out at a couple of other locations, we stumbled upon The Whiski - what a nice and friendly restaurant this was - and an official Fringe Festival venue as well.   They seated us outside, where we could watch all that was going on with the festival and enjoy the rare sunshine. First \"course\" was a round of light beer, consumed in short order by our thirsty group, followed by stronger and darker IPA, which our Australian server (\"you've come a long way, mate!\") recommended as it \"paired\" well with our meal orders of haggis and freshly-caught Scottish salmon.   The haggis was a revelation - I tried it with anticipation, others in our group with a little trepidation (after checking Wikipedia, which I don't think helped their cause!). The portions looked small but were dense and filling, and the sheep organ meat embedded in the oatmeal \"mash\" was divine - flavorful and spicy (must've simmered for hours!). I shamelessly and happily polished off what the others did not want!   Our second course of baked Scottish salmon was more to the groups liking. The salmon was freshly-caught as advertised and baked perfectly, with a nice crisp to the skin. I enjoyed it, but it was a distant second to the haggis in my book.   More rounds of beer followed (I stopped after my customary two drinks), and then we headed off into the heart of the Fringe Festival - hunger satisfied - ready to experience what Edinburgh had to offer.",

    "text": "My wife and I stopped in here for dinner one night and had a fantastic evening.  I got the scottish salmon with lemon sauce, which was cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious (not too lemony/acidic). My wife got the WHISKI burger which came with haggis and whisky sauce! Despite it's somewhat impractical size, she managed to finish most of it and enjoyed it quite a bit.   After dinner we decided to try a whisky tasting. Whiski helpfully provides a selection of whisky tasting flights to choose from on their drinks menu. This was perfect for us, since we did not have any prior experience in this area. In particular, they have a whisky flight for beginners which we shared. They flight came with four whiskys and a helpful information pamphlet describing the smells and tastes the whiskys were supposed to evoke. Trying the different whiskys with my wife was a lot of fun and stimulated some really enjoyable and amusing conversations!   I would recommend Whiski for their food, but I especially would recommend coming here to try out Whisky Flight #1 if you've never tried whiskey and don't know where to start.",

Started with the bread and butter, there were about 6 slices of bread and they were thick. No complaints. For dinner, I had the Scottish salmon which came with mashed potatoes and peas, carrots, snap peas. The lemon fill sauce was delicious and came on the side. I very much enjoyed it. My husband had the steak pie. The sauce was a sweet gravy-DELICIOUS. It came with fries, and vegetables. Overall I would give the food an A.

They also have a large number of whisky flights to choose from if you'd like to sample a variety, complete with tasting notes. Staff are very friendly and knowledgable.   I opted for the Whiski Burger, a rather unwieldy burger topped with haggis and a whisky sauce. It was really good, but pretty unmanageable, and a bit expensive (though that's to be expected as this place is in tourist central). Brandon A. got the salmon, which I tried and was really fantastic.    Nice, casual place to get a solid introduction to whisky, and sample some decent Scottish fare. They also have live music every night!",

Finally I ended up at the WHISKI bar & restaurant!   Started the meal with a traditional Scottish soup: Cullen Skink, which was my favourite dish of the day. Super yummy. The must-try Haggis tower came in a very generous portion, that tastes more delicious with oak crackers. And finally the Whiski burger(with haggis on top), I was kind of stuffed full of haggis..so I am sorry, Whiski burger, there was just no room for the chemistry we could have had. Service-wise, the waiter is attentive and very knowledgeable about whisky!   Will I come back? That's for sure. It's a great place to start tasting Edinburgh and be introduced to scottish cuisine!",

After walking all over the place we came upon WHISKI Bar and Restaurant and waited the five minutes until they opened. We were the first ones to enter and be seated so we had our pick of seating.   The bartender was the first to greet us and he explained they weren't serving food for another 15 minutes. That's ok, we could start drinking! We ordered drinks and when it came to order I tried the fish cakes for an appetizer and the fish and chips as the main dish.   The fish cakes were absolutely delicious. They were the best fish cakes I have ever had. The pops of stone ground mustard was magnificent! It was so good I could have been happy eating just that! But the fish and chips were equally good! Well not equally but very close!   The service was good. It was like more people started to work so we seemed to get someone new for every step but each was very friendly. I really enjoyed it!",

We were ok with that but could not wait at the bar because of our kids. Ok again, we walked around for a bit and our table was ready at 8:00. After waiting to be seated while the manager argued with a couple who wanted a table, we were seated and had to wait 15 minutes for menus and another 10 to get our order taken.   Our appetizers arrived quickly and the haggis tower was delicious. But this is where it took a turn for the worse.   A waitress (who did not take our order) arrived with 3 out of 5 entrees, one of which did not belong to us. Then she came back and asked what we ordered, and said the three orders had not been placed. Another 30 minutes later and 2 of the 3 orders arrived. It seems someone (waitress? Cook?) did not realize we ordered 2 of the same Venison dishes. At 9:45!!! Two and a half hours after we first stepped foot in the pub, our last entree arrived!  The manager brought it and asked what happened. We told him and he took the last venison off the bill.   We appreciated the gesture, but will not return.",

All food is made from scratch on the premises and their menu offers seasonal items as well.  They feature Scottish beef and Scottish fish from Port Seton.  Whiski has 300 scotch malt whiskies too!    I chose the venison rump with Port-Thyme sauce and herb-crushed potatoes, 21.95.  It was nothing short of AMAZING!  Medium-rare as ordered, this ranks in one of the best cuts of meat I have EVER had.  I was tremendously happy.   My dining companions had the Steak & Ale pie, 15.50 and the steak, 19.95.  Both ladies loved their dishes, especially my friend who had the steak, red meat is the thing to get here!  To start, we had the Thistly Cross Cider, 5.50, and it was crisp and refreshing.  My other friend had Edinburgh's own Paolozzi beer, a Munich-style lager, which she enjoyed.  The ambiance is dark and filled with interesting knickknacks.  The ladies' room has McCondoms, which are, of course, whisky-flavoured!  We had a hiccup with service and our reservation was \"lost\" so those are the reasons Whiski is receiving 4 stars instead of 5.  I would, however, definitely return to more menu items and the live music!  Yelp Challenge 2018:  97/100",

Drinks were limited in choice, as were the wine and beer options - could have been more disappointed, but was disappointed just the same. Food was not good at all - ordered a bread plate and a bottle of wine to start and both were bad (didn't come close to finishing either. Then it took about an hour to serve the venison, potatoes, carrots, and peas ordered for an entree. Despite being provided a very sharp knife by our disinterested waitress, I was unable to pierce the protective coating that surrounded the meat I was trying to eat. I finally did saw off a small portion of the venison and was not surprised at all to find that it tasted more like rhino than deer.   Don't hardly EVER trash a place like this - every where we have eaten in Scotland has been amazing. But this place is a True NO GO. Try Devil's Advocate or Makar's Gourmet Mash Bar, heck, even Pizza Hut across the street before you make the mistake of going to this place.",

    "text": "We ate here on the night the Eiffel Tower burned - I don't think I'll ever forget walking inside and gasping with surprise when I saw the TV over the bar, and then watching in horror alongside everyone else at the bar. Anyway, onto the review. There weren't any tables when we arrived, so we started with a wee dram at the bar. As you would expect from an establishment named Whiski Bar, there was a very extensive whisky menu. They advertise as having 300+ to choose from, but I didn't count them. After quite a while waiting at the bar, we finally got a table. It would be almost an hour after that before our food arrived. I'm dinging their rating quite a bit for such a long wait, and for not being upfront about the delays. The waitress's excuse was that there was a large party further back in the restaurant, but surely a restaurant this large right on the main tourist stretch ought to be better prepared for busy dinner hours. The food itself was good but unmemorable. I think I had haggis neeps and tatties, but perhaps that was a different night at a different place. We skipped dessert, because we were tired of sitting in the same place. Verdict: don't come here unless you have a lot of time to spare. I'm certain that there's better places to eat in Edinburgh.",

There are two restaurants that we know of, and we had great meals at both.  We loved the atmosphere and decorations, very warm and welcoming.  If your looking for traditional meals, this is the place.  Fish and chips are outstanding.  Steaks, perfect! Haggis, yes we tried it and recommend the spring rolls for the first time if your not sure (it really is not that bad).  I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu!  Everything is fresh and delicious and cooked to order.  Wait staff is very friendly and helpful when it comes to recommendations.  And the Whisky.....lots of choices and these guys know their stuff.  Let them guide you and you wont regret it.  I don't normally give out 5 stars, so believe me when I say, \"it is that good\"!!!! Good value Clean facility Helpful & Friendly staff.",

We tried the Cullen skink at a few other places and liked theirs the best! Fish and chips and meat pie were good. The sticky toffee pudding was delicious!    Would definitely recommend this place.

Yes they are nearly all marketed with some collage of Scottish themes to pull people in, trap them, then take all their money, but ironically they often end up being a lot more welcoming than a lot of the local pubs in Edinburgh.  But I felt WHISKI was verging on the exploitative. Okay so nothing was that bad. The food is alright and they have a good selection of whisky (I agree with Kate about the whisky cider). But the prices were just too much. I resent having to pay almost 10 for a main course of average pub food. Plus whilst the staff weren't rude they didn't seem interested either. Also why is the name in CAPITALS? I feel like I am being SCREAMED at.  Perhaps I will try WHISKI again and have a better experience. Perhaps like a good Scotsman I should just stick to the drink.",

My favorite drink on the menu is all the vintage Scotch Whiskey they have followed by the rest of the Scotch Whiskey.  If you got a cold and think it may not be a good idea to go to the Whiski Bar.. WRONG THINK AGAIN perfect place to go as their Whiski Hot Toddy can cure most cold's which I though was folk's tale but tried it first hand with a friend  and it helped us fight off some vicious flu like symptoms.  Their Cullen Sink soup is delicious and the Haddock and chips is good  and I don't even like Haddock Fish.

I can surely recommend this place if you want to try some great Whisky. We haven't eaten there, but the menu looked appealing as well.",

    "text": "I had a little look through other reviews and think I may be the only one so far who was not really massively impressed by this place.   It was a lovely Saturday afternoon and after a childish wee stroll through camera obscura I took my friend here for lunch. He is very much a soup and a sandwich type of bloke so the fact this was on the menu here was a bonus. We arrived and were told that there were no tables, even though I could quite clearly see one, and that they were unsure how long the wait would be. A couple of moments later this was corrected, and we were promptly seated.  The menu here did not blow me away to be honest, pretty much as I expected, soup, sandwiches, the usual scottish fayre really. I had a salmon, lemon and creme fraiche sandwich and he ordered the sweet potato soup with a chicken mayo sandwich. There really was quite a wait for drinks, and for food. The system here seems very disorganised and they did not seem on the ball at all.  The food arrived and it looked good at a brief glance. On further inspection, great big crusty bread for the sandwich, good move. Little to pretty much no filling, very disappointing. The soup, which I wish I had ordered, was very good. Then he bites into his sandwich to find that it is salmon too, not what he had ordered. But we had waited so long, and he is a boy, he will eat anything, so he did. Needless to say, I don't think he was too impressed.  We then asked for the bill, went to pay, etc. We were not asked once if everything was alright or if we enjoyed our food, which to me is just common courtesy. Overall, I had high hopes which sadly were not met. Maybe another time.",

    "text": "I had intended to avoid WHISKI because the cutesy spelling of the name and it's location on the Royal Mile made me think this was a tourist trap of self-important trendiness. It reminded me of all of the \"ultra-lounges\" at the corporate-run Las Vegas resorts.   However, when I decided that I wanted try haggis, a few folks suggested WHISKI as a good place to go.   WHISKI is nice and classy, but not to the point that I felt underdressed. The menu is definitely aimed at tourists and serves mostly what one would think of as \"traditional Scottish fare\" (not to be confused with \"typical Scottish fare\" which usually seems to include Tikka Masala). I ordered the haggis tower (with neeps and tatties) and found it to be excellent. My wife had fish and chips and said they were great.   The whiskey selection was unsurprisingly broad. The prices were a little higher than you would get elsewhere, but you expect that in a nicer tourist place right on High St.",

I went with a friend and we had a prime table in the window, out of the way of the big tables of Christmas-dinner groups.   I can't give an extensive food review, as we started with olives and bread and then both had mussels with chips - but everything was just the best possible quality and tasted amazing. Huge pots filled with tender mussels in a rich creamy sauce, a pile of crispy-thin French fries - yum.   The staff were everything you could ask for, too - friendly, helpful, and funny. I'll be going back, as soon as possible!",

There was only server for the whole area and it was pretty hectic, so we were ignored for a while. Once we ordered it took almost an hour to get our food, which was crazy. We had the same drinks we got at the bar for about a half hour before anyone asked us if we would like something else. And at the end of it all the dinners were just ok, nothing special. Its clearly a popular place, but i wouldn't recommend it necessarily because there are so many options on the same street where you might be seated and fed much quicker.",

It is position in the centre of the touristy area, however, this place delivers a lot of whisky in a decent setting.  Why do people need to complain? You get over 270 bottles of beautiful whisky and you don't need to get on a ferry and fight off Highland cows to get a bloody dram.   Decent selection and some exceptional rare bottlings, make this worth a visit.",

They handled the large group well, although we had pre-ordered the food so it wasn't too difficult, apart from the people who forgot what they ordered (there's always one).  Really nice place, of course great position above the Mound. Cosy wooden interior and then good view outside. Great for warming up after being outside in the cold. However the food wasn't great - our venison was rather chewy and some people barely touched it. The soup starter was fine but no butter came with the bread.  The price was to be expected for the location, although the beer was very expensive and one might have expected a little more from the food for that price.",

But what was even better were the drinks and service. We ordered two taste flights of whiskey - the beginner flight and the regional flight. None of us are big fans of whiskey, but it was fun to try each of them and to read the descriptions that came with the flights! Additionally, our server was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. She provided wonderful service and answered all of our questions about the food & drinks! The location on the Royal Mile was great, and we enjoyed the general atmosphere. I would have loved to try the food on their full menu, but we still left feeling full & happy!",

I realized I was starving since I hadn't eaten since breakfast and could use a good meal.  I will not deny that the name Whiski helped me choose to stop here.  The staff was friendly and I was impressed by their extensive menu of whisky.  I opted for a whisky cider which is cider distilled in a whisky cask to give it flavor.  It was my favorite cider that I've had in the UK.  Since I was starving I ordered some food too.  I don't remember the name of the dish but it was beef in an ale gravy with veggies and chips.  Since I figured this was just a pub that catered to tourists I was surprised at the quality of the food, it was really good.  I had another whisky cider and was on my way.  It ended up being the best meal I had during my short trip to Scotland.  Should I find myself back in Edinburgh I would very much like to come back here.",

The Royal Mile on a Saturday night during August can get a bit too much, littered with broken bottles and rowdy (but usually good natured) drunkards. Whiski managed to provide a safe haven from all this, and whilst still mobbed was almost relaxing.  The manager cleared a table up the back so we could have a seat, they sold Wasabi Peas, and even the Bargain Basement Russel Brand singing in the corner had a couple of acceptable tunes up his sleeve.
