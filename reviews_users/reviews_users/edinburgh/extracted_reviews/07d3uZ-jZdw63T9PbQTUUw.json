    "text": "My 3rd review of this place - I now love it, rely on it and couldnt be without it!!  By example over the course of one weekend I made 3 visits for 3 totally different reasons.  Visit 1: Lunch - Their Barcelona Sandwich which i had as a toasted wrap - soft smokes chorizo with manchego and a balsamic glazed rocket salad! It was perfect - so so so good and just what I was looking for. Finished with a very nice espresso!  Visit 2: Deli Items - Sundried tomatos, fresh tomatos, garlic, black olives, dried porchini and crayfish tails.  Visit 3: Wine - lovely cabarnet saviogon under a tenner and very tasty!  All in all tremendous - they are also now one of the only stockists I have seen of salted cod which seems to be the in thing in recipes I read!! :)  JD = ooober happy man!",

Spicy, nice seasoned and quite fresh!  They have a quite good selection of wine and cheeses. Also we found our favourite tortillas chips in there which was handful! Would definitely come back and try their salads that looked quite nice too.",

Why is this place not closer to MY place??!!!  Also grabbed a bag of Buffalo Wing flavoured pretzel chips.. yes.. you read that right.. BUFFALO WING pretzel chips..   Aside from those morsels of deliciousness, they had a selection of other sandwiches in the fridge or you could make your own from the counter..   Deli part seems well stocked though I didn't have too much time to look around. Also have a good selection of cheeses as well.  There's a few seats inside if you want to sit in, I chose to take my food and sit out in the sun by the Shore!",

It's a fairly high-end deli, where you can go for a sophisticated kind of sandwich or light lunch, or else do some gourmet shopping - they stock a range of cheeses, pickles, fancy-looking vegetables and the like.  It's a little pricey, but seems less so when you consider what the equivalent kind of shop would charge you somewhere like New Town.  And if you know your Roquefort from your Dolcelatte, then you'll recognise that Relish is a place of quality.",

    "text": "A great little deli cafe, Relish is ideal for getting that quick bite to eat at lunch time or a morning coffee.   Located near the water of Leith, and on Commercial Street, Relish provides freshly made sandwiches, homemade soups and a selection of hot drinks. Furthermore, it provides a wide range of cheeses, meats and Italian themed foods, including olives.   I have been there a few times and on both times the food has been excellent and defiantly represents value for money. The soup and bread combo does not cost much more than two or three pounds, the tomato basil soup I tasted was warm and tasty. However, if you want a bit more to eat I can also advise upon the sandwiches. I had a baguette with cheese, salami Milano and a red onion salad. Again it was great and very filling as well!  I would certainly visit Relish again and I am envious of the people of Leith for having such a good deli cafe!",

The massive range of fresh sandwiches are prepared in front of you can you can choose your filling from the big glass counter. As well as soups and sandwiches, you can also buy hard to find grocery items that you won't find in most supermarkets. Delicious speciality cheeses, meats and olives, to name a few. The staff are really friendly and will help you make sense of the huge range of delicious ingredients. If you are in a hurry there are usually some of the more popular sandwiches made up and ready to go.",
