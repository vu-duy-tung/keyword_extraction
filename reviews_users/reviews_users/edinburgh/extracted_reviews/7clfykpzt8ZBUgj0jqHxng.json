    "text": "Small Thai restaurant in Edinburgh serving tasty dishes. The breadth of the menu is quite good, and there's a varied assortment of salads, appetizers, mains, etc. The menu also has a short description of the dish, but imo there should be more pictures as Thai food really pictures well. Most people only order Pad Thai as it is probably the only familiar thing on the menu to its customers. More pictures of the dishes would be helpful.  I ordered Thai green curry, steamed rice and thai iced tea. The presentation of the dishes was quite strange, as the curry was served in a bowl on a huge plate, and the rice in separate bowl (but not on a plate). Utensils included a knife and fork (though I can't imagine how a knife would be used in Thai food). Chinese soup spoons were served along with the curry and rice. I mean... where's the regular spoon that is typically used by Thais? The food is this resto is generally good and the service was quick and friendly. My suggestion is to offer the mains as a \"set menu,\" with rice and a choice of curry and optional fried egg, the way they do it in Thailand. And yes, spoons please!",

He goes there weekly with his girlfriend.  So, why my doubts, lets start with the bad: - relative small portions for the price, especially from the outside it looks like a cheaper place. starters are 5.95 and mains are 9.95 or 14.95 and then you add 2.95 for rice.  - the place was cold, but she tried very hard to heat it up with small hallogen heaters, still was not enough  Why do I give 4 anyways and would I have given 5 if not for previous points: - the food is DELICIOUS. I was in Nothern thailand for a while and this is really it. Super flavourful... I had the beef garlic pepper stir fry and there was such a rich diversity in flavour. My colleague recommended me to ask extra sauce which I forgot and i should have, because it mixes perfectly with the coconut rice! - super nice friendly and adorable Thai lady. You see she put her heart in this place and creates a bond with her regulars. - we got a surprise scoop of coconut ice cream in the end!  If I ever crave Thai I now know where to go for the real stuff, will keep it as a future special treat.... They also do take away!",

But check the menu before you go as their menu isn't like standard Thai places - no flat rice noodles or typical eggplant dishes, etc but what they have - or what we ordered was just amazing. We got their Green Curry, Pad Thai and duck dish. All of them were great, they had a good portion size so we couldn't even finish our food.  Also just FYI they are a byob.",

    "text": "First time I visited this little place, which is located near Haymarket. It's about a 5 min walk from the train station or any bus station for that matter. I must have passed it a few times without noticing.  People are raving about this place, but personally I fail to see the attraction. Could be that I have never been to Thailand and do not know the local food. However,  there are also other nice Thai restaurants in Edinburgh to compare it to.  The restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived. Four other people were sitting in the window seats, which had electric heaters. Sadly for the rest of us, we could feel the cold more than we wanted to. I had my jacket on all the time. There were about 10 tables and I can imagine that it can become pretty squeezy when it's packed with customers.  At least it would be warm :-)  I ordered chicken satay and a Hot and Sour soup with shrimps and mushrooms. For both of these starters I paid 5.95 each. Maybe it's me, but I felt that this price for a soup was quite dear! Both dishes tasted pretty ok. Nothing special. Having said this, they have a lovely and extensive menu choice and I am sure you will be able to find something on there. All dishes seem to be made from scratch, which means, it's all fresh.!  The lady, 1 staff, was super friendly and you could see the love and effort she put towards making us as comfortable and happy as we could be. We even got a complimentary coconut scoop for dessert. It was a real nice gesture.  I did not visit the toilets,  but I would think there are some. I saw a person passing by walking towards the back. They also do Takeaway and if you want alcohol you best make sure to bring some. It's BYOB. I would have given this place 3 stars, but with the ice cream scoop and my wishful thinking that in summer the place is warmer,  I gave it a 4 star.",

If a Thai restaurant in the UK doesn't offer som tam on it's menu then it isn't a real Thai. It's just another Cantonese version of a foreign concept (yes every sushi restaurant bar one in Edinburgh I am looking at you!).  The salads here are good, fried dishes taste like Thailand and the noodles have a hint of tamarind and not ketchup like other places. They even said they could make me Mee Krob if I ordered in advance. They are northern Thai so menu is flavoured as such.  Also - this place is crazy cheap! Well worth the money.  PLEASE DON'T CLOSE!",

    "text": "Tucked away in a street just off Haymarket, this restaurant was a lovely little find. The decor is fresh, clean and modern. A group of twelve of us went for their lunchtime offer of two courses for 7.50.  There's a b-i-g choice of starters and mains included in the lunch menu, and choosing was tricky as everything looked so tasty! The quality of the food really is fabulous. I had chicken springrolls for a starter - five delicate little springrolls with a gorgeous sweet and spicy dip. The stir-fried beef as a main was served with sticky rice and the beef was tender and very tasty. The servings are a good size, too - I didn't leave hungry, and if you know me, you'll know that this me very happy.  Bluerapa isn't licensed, but operates a BYOB policy with a 2 corkage charge. They have a range of soft drinks on offer.  There were only two staff when we visited, a waiter and a chef. They balanced out the workload well by taking orders for starters and mains separately, to allow the waiter to help in the kitchen. Service was excellent, and very smooth indeed.  After our meal, we chatted to them both. The diminutive lady chef is very enthusiastic about what she does, and explained that visitors are arriving by word of mouth - they haven't done any advertising. They do have a few regulars who drop by for lunch quite often. I'll definitely be going back.",
