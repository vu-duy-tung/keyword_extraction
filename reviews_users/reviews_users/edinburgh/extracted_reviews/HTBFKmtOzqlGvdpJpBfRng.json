    "text": "La Piazza is an amazing restaurant near Princes Street which serves delicious food and drink and has hilarious staff.  I came here with parents which was a relief because it is pretty pricey.  It's definitely worth it though as all their food tastes incredible and is served in filling portions.   I opted for the polenta starter which had tasty Italian sausage and a spicy chilli sauce.  I then had the tuna and tomato pasta which was probably one of the tastiest mains I've ever had.  The main courses are all actually pretty well priced, but the most of the starters cost around 6-7.   One of the waiters had me howling with laughter at just about every course!  He was cracking jokes about everything, and some of them were pretty risque but it livened up the whole evening.  I'd definitely come here again any day and I recommend anyone to try it out.",

    "text": "I used to pass La Piazza many a time before the tram works destroyed the Coates Crescent/Shandwick Place area. Finally, thanks to Jackie G, a last minute chance to grab food arose and we headed here.  Jackie had recommended it before as being good for gluten free. After trying to decide between risotto or gf pasta, it was nice to even have a choice between gf penne or spaghetti. We only went for main courses and this has proved to be enough as the portions are good.  After the chat about Yelpers worst foods, mushrooms were on my mind, so I went for chicken, mushrooms and a cream brandy garlic sauce which was lovely! The gf pasta was cooked perfectly, something some restaurants struggle with (yes, Jamie's Italian) and the brandy in the sauce came through without being overpowered by the garlic. A good helping of mushrooms and chicken and just the right amount of sauce - enough to coat the food, not for it to swim in.  Service is efficient and friendly without being obtrusive. There is a deal currently on if you book through their website and use the appropriate code for 50% off food, except the day of Her Madgesty's visit, so getting a deal on La Piazza would be a steal.",

From that moment on we had impeccable service, even on a busy Saturday evening.  The place was full, with a good background roar of conversation, but not so loud that you had to shout at your partner.    We ordered salad and seafood as starters and different pasta dishes as mains.  It was all good.  Nothing to complain about, but I don't think it merited the five stars being awarded by other Yelpers.",

A brief question to the server and within minutes we had a lovely dish full of black and green olives on the table. Very pleased, and a great experience to start off the meal.  I ordered the rigatoni with sausage in a tomato cream sauce, and my husband ordered the truffle tortellini with porcini. Both were fantastic. My dish had a great balance between creamy and spicy tomato, exactly what I was wanting. His dish was good and earthy - I've never really had mushrooms that were so flavorful, usually they are more texture than taste. Both dishes were absolute hits with us.  For dessert I ordered the ricotta and pear cheesecake - yum! It was very good, a perfect end note to the meal.  We had a great meal and overall experience at La Piazza.",

You see, he cooks excellent Italian food, including his own pizzas (yes, yes, he makes the dough), but I managed to convince him this was a 'proper' Italian restaurant and off we went, braving the heavy Edinburgh summer rain. I had booked a table for 6pm on a Saturday and was pleasantly surprised to find that the restaurant was busy, despite the tram works on Shandwick place.  The staff were very pleasant and showed to our table and we got onto deciding what to eat rom the fairly extensive pizza menu. To balance our meal, we started we a platter of vegetable antipasti to share. It said 2-3 people on the menu, and they were certainly not lying.  We didn't even finish as we needed space for our pizza!   For pizza, we opted for a 'four seasons' and a 'diablo' that we shared.  They were both very good.  None that thick dough - too much filling nonsense you can find in some places. The meal was accompanied by a reasonably priced Sauvignon Blanc.  The service was excellent and quick, the staff were lovely. I certainly recommend the place.  Totally worth braving the tram works!",

In fact, I was talking so much that I'm surprised I managed to get any food down me at all. Which would have been a shame, as the food here is phenomenal.  I had a mozzarella, roast peppers and sun-dried tomato salad for my starter, which was drizzled in their home-made pesto and was absolutely amazing. The main course was just as tasty, and unlike a lot of risotto dishes in restaurants it didn't leave me feeling really stodgy and too full by the end, whilst still being a decent-sized portion. In fact, everyone's main courses looked gorgeous, but as it was my first time meeting the family I didn't think we were really at the \"nicking food off eachothers' plates\" stage yet, so I couldn't tell you how they tasted.  The prices are perfect too. It costs just enough that you know the service and quality of it all is going to be great, but not so pricey that you need a special occasion to justify going. Which is handy, when you liked it as much as I did. Next time I'm out in this area of the city centre in the evening and want somewhre to go eat, I'll definitely be going here.",

We were greeted by the friendly front of house staff and seated in the nicely decorated, light dining room at the back of the restaurant. The house red wine was nice, but our garlic bread starter was too light on the garlic for my taste.  However, my main of chicken and mushroom pasta in a brandy cream and garlic sauce was absolutely delicious! Not swimming in sauce which I find that creamy pastas can be at some restaurants. My friend's carbonara was good, but nothing to rave about I was told.  When asked if we wanted a dessert menu, we were hesitant as were both full, but decided to have a wee look.....a wee look is never just a wee look! As soon as I saw Tiramisu, I wanted it, so we decided to share one.  Surprisingly light with subtle masala wine, coffee & chocolate flavours, was a perfect way to finish.  I can honestly say it was the best meal that I've had in Edinburgh. Simple, non-pretentious, classic flavours delivered well :)",

After walking 20 minutes, we got there at 9:30 (a full hour before the advertised closing time) and were told that they \"closed early\". No \"we're sorry\" or anything, just said \"we closed early\" and walked away.  Don't market yourself as a late night restaurant if it's not True. I let our hotel concierge know so hopefully they won't send anyone here in the future to be dissappointed.  Bar Italia not too far away ended up being a much better alternative!",

Rather pricy, but norm for the location in Edinburgh. Very good service, nice wine selection. I think I would go back and the next time I would order a more authentic Italian meal.

Not a problem.  We arrived and they showed us to our table. They had split the table into two with one around the corner from the other. It was a bit disappointing to be split up but I suppose it was a large group to accommodate.   The food came out quickly and everyone got what they ordered. Great! The food itself is very nice, I went for the mushroom risotto. It was a good portion and very tasty! There menu is full of Italian classics at our 9 for a main so it is very reasonable.

I loved the side of asparagus, especially with the shaved Parmesan flakes, and my Rigatoni alla Norcina was  incredibly good, not too creamy, very flavorful but not spicy, and oh so good. The server, with his thick Italian accent, was friendly and spouted little things in Italian (such as Mille Grazie) throughout the meal.

Food was fresh and service was friendly.  I ended up only eating 2/3 of my pizza so the leftovers made for a nice breakfast the next morning.",

    "text": "Wandering around Edinburgh all day, my parents and I were hungry for some pizza. We were staying near Princes Street, so I was happy to see a well-reviewed place that served pizza right nearby! We showed up at an off time (like 2:30 on a Monday) but La Piazza was still open for business. The waiter we had was super friendly and welcoming also!  Now, I am from New York City so I am a bit of a pizza snob, and this was my first slice of pizza in Edinburgh so I didn't know what to expect! Well, I was pleasantly surprised! We each ordered a rocket salad, which was yummy, and two pizzas to split between the three of us which was the perfect amount of food. We all really enjoyed the Piccante pizza which had peppers, pepperoni, and chili on it. The chili was a great addition, as in the US we are not used to having that as a topping. We also ordered the margarita pizza, which while good, was really just a cheese pizza with a sprig of basil on it and not a margarita pizza.   Anyway, I will definitely return to this place if I am in the area, it is perfect for one of my favorite go-to meals of salad and pizza with beer, and if no one is there to share the pizza with me I will just box the other half to go (or probably eat it all myself).",

    "text": "On a rainy early afternoon there was a table booked for lunch, 8/9 people. The gentleman (manager, owner?) was quick on his feet and and found the reservation. We were guided past the bar to the center of the dining area.  There the tables were pushed together and thoughtfully laid out for a (possible) 9 guests.  Handing out our lunch menu's he took our drinks order. Very courteous and friendly he was.  He was waiting for taking our meal orders until everybody had arrived, he was waiting for the 9th  and (fruitlessly) tried to entice us to buying wine. - However as we were to go to wine tasting event it fell on deaf ears. That said the vodka, beer and gin was flowing quite nicely..  The order was done efficient, 'ladies first' on every thing I noticed. Sweet man. I asked for some mushrooms in my carbonara and this came out as I expected. He supplied the black pepper and cheese. patiently waiting for conversations to finish.  Getting the dessert/ coffee or the bill was a little less efficient - but that may be due to the fact the our man had left the building and we were left with the waitresses.   It is good value, varied service and a pleasant environment.  I would return.",

    "text": "Went here with a group of 8 people before the 'Wine with a View event'. It was deemed sensible to have some food before trying all those wines and champagnes later on. I am so glad I came here, it did serve its purpose very well!  La Piazza is on Shandwick Place, close to Haymarket and perhaps will now attract lots more customers since the tramworks have finally completed in this area.  The staff are very friendly and welcoming. The menu has all the usual Italian dishes you would expect - pasta, risotto, pizza etc. Some quirky pizza options include toppings such as ham, tomato and french fries! I'm a pizza lover, but this time I chose a pasta dish: fusilli with chicken, mushrooms and cream sauce. I can't fault the dish, it was tasty - but on the other hand it wasn't spectacularly good.   This is a quality Italian restaurant - I may need a few more visits to fully appreciate its offerings.",

My boy had book group, so I usually meet with him before for dinner and go along with him to the book group, so tonight's dinner choice was here.  First off, the staff are all friendly. Really welcoming.  I was seated at the window, but wished it was a wall because it was chilly. Other than that the whole experience was fine.  We shared a cold meat board, which consisted of mortadella (my fav), salami's, parma ham and really nice chicken liver pate and warmed bruscetta.  We both ordered pizza - mine being chicken and mushen with an extra of rosemary and the boy's being anchovies and capers with an extra of salami.  The pizza's are really tasty and have a lovely thin base - just the way pizza's should be.    I had a glass of red wine with my meal, which was super nice.  Defo would recommend if you are in the area for lunch or dinner.",

    "text": "I bought the 2 mains for 10.00 vouchers ages ago and finally used it last week.   After some extremely negative comments about the poor service (wrong orders, unapologetic staff) from a friend who had recently dined here, I must admit that I was a bit apprehensive.   My fears were completely allayed by the effusive welcome from the staff, the cheeky manager who pointed out I was late and the very cheerful and chatty Italian waitress who served our table.   We ordered a bottle of their house Merlot, which was reasonably priced and tasted pretty good. My dinner partner and I then started the long deliberation over the choices on the menu. When the waitress arrived for the third time to take our order and we were still vacillating between a few of the pasta and pizza options she helpfully suggested going half and half! Boom!   We ordered the Rigatoni Piazza (recommended by the waitress) and the Campagnola which were both lovely.   The portion sizes were quite large which unfortunately left me no room for dessert even after we sat for a fair while finishing off our wine.   Delicious meal, great service and while it was an absolute bargain at 5.00 pp with the voucher, I would definitely go back even without. And soon.",

Possibly slightly more expensive than anticipated, pizza bases slightly overbaked, pasta portions a bit small.... However.... the service was excellent and the food tasty. Nice atmosphere. And joy upon joy, they do half pizza half pasta so you get can the best of both worlds. Thank god my partner was willing to take the other \"half\" :)   Would go back. It's not a special occasion place however if you need some pasta and you're in that area it beats Zizzi for authenticity.",
