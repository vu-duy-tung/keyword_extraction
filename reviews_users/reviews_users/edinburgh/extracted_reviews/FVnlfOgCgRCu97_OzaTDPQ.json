    "text": "Noticed this as I stood at the tram platform - yes! TRAMS!  Not sure if there was anything here before, as my memory is a bit fuzzy being an older bloke. That's the reason, not the alcohol, honestly...  In any case, previously if you wanted a drink at Haymarket, there was only Ryrie's on scene, given the passing of the much missed Caledonian Ale House. Platform 5 has opened to try and cash in on that footfall.  It's pleasant enough, too. When I popped in, they were in the midst of World Cup mania - bunting, flags, banners, special offers, you name it. They were also showing the Chile-Australia game at 11pm, and going by the staff, they said they were open until 1am, so you could see the end of it! Cracking!  A wide selection of beers on tap - as you'd expect from a Bellhaven pub - and the usual stick of spirits and bottled beers means you're not left with a thirst - the menu online looks pretty good too, standard \"pub grub\" that looks like it's a decent quality.  It's nice to have a bit of choice right next to the trains and trams, it also means that theoretically, there should be less of a rush at the bar of whichever business you choose.",

    "text": "When Platform 5 opened up across from Haymarket train station, it looked trendy and fun. I mistook it for a nice new craft beer bar but when I met a friend here for a drink I was underwhelmed. It's really just a sports bar that is busy after work but it has a poor beer and cider selection, pretty much focused on the mass-produced and not very tasty generic beverages. The place was a bit loud and not very comfortable or inviting either. Better to give it a miss.   #underdog",

Warm, relaxing, friendly atmosphere, that caters for kids also. The food is delicious, I recommend you try the Cajun penne pasta. Amazing!  My niece is a fussy eater but wolfed down their macaroni cheese so a big thumbs up from me and all at a reasonable price. So go on visit  Platform 5 today, I dare you!",

This was the worst burger I ever had, and we have had a few! I would definitely rather go for a McDonald's burger than this place. The meat was definitely not venison. It was probably just venison and a great mix of pork and flour. My partners burger was dry and hard! Skip this place and go for something else. The staff was welcoming, but too busy! Definitely a lot of nice food in Edinburgh.",
