    "text": "Found this place hidden just off Cockburn street, and have been craving a good Pad Thai for the past several months. The inside of the place is very well decorated, with a subtle and authentic feel. The staff were very friendly and fast with service.   Now the food... The food was excellent! We asked for the Pad Thai to be spicy, and they added some red peppers imported specifically from thailand for extra spice. It certainly delivered on that front. We also split a deep fried banana and ice cream at the end, which was generously portioned and very delicious.   Upon leaving, they gave us some coupons for 10% off on our next visit. This will be happening soon.",

    "text": "I believe this restaurant is now called Krua Khun Mae. It's a very quaint Thai restaurant hidden in an alley down some stairs, on the Royal Mile. Service was very gracious. And, the food was delightful. I loved the grilled meat in banana leaves we had for an appetizer. Delicious. I wish I remembered the name of it. I had the Pad Pong Karee, which I think is a Northern Thai dish. It was perfect. Our server gave us some additional Thai chilies to add some spice as the coconut curries can be a little sweeter. But overall a great meal especially when you are trying to avoid traditional Scottish food, like Haggis and Blood Pudding....",

    "text": "After a couple of False starts - coming in just after 3pm, when they evidently close, although nowhere in their listed hours does it state this, and coming in on a Sunday, when they are evidently closed, although their sign still stands on Cockburn Street - we finally made it into this tiny, half-hidden Thai restaurant for lunch. They have a good lunch menu - 2 courses for 8 - so of course we had to give it a try.   It's a really cute space, tucked away in an alley, so it's dark and intimate, and well-decorated, albeit tiny. The service was really friendly, and our food was brought out quickly (although we were one of two parties in the joint). We started with chicken satay and tempura battered vegetables, and they were both quite solid - the chicken tender and juicy, the vegetables lightly fried and flavorful. For our mains we opted for pad thai (a staple, of course) and a stir-fry with beef, vegetables and a light pepper sauce, served with fried rice. The pad thai was on the sweet side, but it was served with red chilies, which you could mix with the noodles for your desired heat level. The pepper beef was tender and tasty. The portions aren't enormous, but good for the price. We left happy.",

    "text": "I wasn't at all thrilled with the place. Our food was far too sweet, and the dishes weren't spicy unless we asked, even my chicken and basil dish, which normally is quite spicy. The coconut rice surely had added sugar, as did my coconut soup.  The space is pretty, for sure, but the food I found sipid and uninspiring, and quite pricey.",

    "text": "Thank goodness I have friends that go to the University of Edinburgh. I was craving Thai food, and not being from this side of the Atlantic, I asked my friends where we could go. This restaurant, hidden down one of the city's many alleyways, is one of the cutest and most charming restaurants I've ever been to. It was clean, the tables were set beautifully, and it's hidden so it seems like only the locals know it - all the better for them.  The food was also really good - I was already full from my afternoon tea at eteaket, but the pad thai was absolutely delicious. I wish I could go back and order it again - maybe during one of my breaks I'll go visit again and do an update.",

    "text": "My family and I tried this place on our last night in Edinburgh and I was glad we did. It's a nice restaurant with interesting decor. We tried fish cake and crispy sesame chicken bread as starters. The sesame chicken was very good we had to order 1more. For the main course we ordered pad thai, red curry chicken, and stir fried beef. The pad Thai and red curry were very good, not too sweet. The stir fried beef was not bad. It was a rainy day so I ordered coffee, which was surprisingly delicious.   Service was immaculate. We were served by the owner himself. This restaurant has just been under new management recently and I was told that there would be some menu changes. I could only hope the he would keep the 2 starters we ordered :)   We would have ordered desserts (fried banana etc) if we were not too full. Another cup of coffee would have been perfect!",
