Had the Goi Cuon (Fresh Spring Rolls) and Pho Bo Tai (Noodle Soup with Raw Beef) -- cause any decent Vietnamese shop has gotta have good Pho, and in Edinburgh, hot soup always goes well with wet weather.  The soup broth was nice, but the beef was tough and noodles chewy. How can you mess that up? So sad...",

BUT It was alarming to me how the hostess when I walked in felt the need to tell me after I was seated that The table needed to be vacated by a certain time. That was not the first time I've had that done to while in Edinbrugh either. I took 1 star off for a lack of etiquette but if you're not bothered by that , please go and enjoy the food.",

    "text": "While this was my first venture into traditional Vietnamese Pho, and don't have much to compare it with, I was won over by this lovely little place and its extremely tasty dishes that offered great value for money.  This is a tiny restaurant that must only seat about 20 people, and although we didn't have a reservation and they were busy, rovision were made to accommodate us which was great.   The concept of Pho is that its up to you how it tastes, so you are given a bowl of soup noodles (stock, noodles, veg and meat/tofu) along with chilli sauce, fresh lime and beansprouts on this side which you can add as you wish to change the flavour.  On its own it was already a fresh a tasty broth, with well cooked noodles and plenty of veg but the chilli sauce on offer was excellent and really enhanced the flavour.  The novelty of being given the bean sprouts on the side means they retained the crunchiness.   The waitress, and I believe owner, was extremely helpful and friendly and the artwork on the wall (which I also believe was painted by her) was lovely.  The food was very reasonably priced, i would go as far as to say cheap, with a large bowl (which was very large) being under 7 and with the fact it was BYOB with minimal corkage, it was definitely falls into the \"cheap eats\" category.  I highly recommend this, but would advise to book ahead to avoid disappointment.",

In fact, I was so happy - I booked us in the moment after I finished reading about it.   The food, especially the fried Spring Rolls & Pho were delicious. We enjoyed the experience and the owner was so lovely and friendly.   The restaurant is really small so I would suggest calling to book - I imagine they will be full every night really soon.   We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "My best advice to you is to get yourself down to Vietnam House now, immediately, before word gets out, it gets busy, prices go up and it moves to a larger premises, which would diminish it's perfect, bijoux charm.  Upon arrival at Vietnam House, we were greeted by the genuine, ebullient welcome of the owner, Jodie. The interior is small, but bright and perfectly formed, with a window booth for seating larger parties and five other tables which seat up to four people, albeit somewhat snugly. As we pored over the menu, struggling to decide which tempting treats to indulge in, Jodie kindly invited us to put our wine in the fridge beside us to stop it getting warm. It was almost like being in a good friend's house and told to make yourself at home!  Eventually we decided on fresh spring rolls, followed by Pho Chay (tofu noodle soup) and Com Ca Kho (braised fish with steamed rice). Our lollipop-style starter arrived perched on skewers, a quirky twist which was in juxtaposition to the quirkless simplicity of the dish itself. The overwhelming freshness of the ingredients sang through, soft rice pancakes wrapped around rice noodles, the pork and shrimp harmonising perfectly with the Vietnamese special peanut sauce - my only criticism being that there was not enough of the sauce, leaving the overall dish lacking punch ever so slightly.  Our light starter was followed without too much delay by our fragrant mains. My companion had been advised that the large soup was quite substantial - no exaggeration by anyone's standards! A sizeable bowl arrived, accompanied by coriander, bean sprouts and other accompaniments, to be added to the hearty soup, according to taste. After some experimentation, it was decided that the (once again) outstandingly fresh tasting soup, which spoke simply yet eloquently of the balanced blend of ingredients used, was best enjoyed with a smattering of sprouts and a clutch of coriander on top.  The braised fish dish arrived in a bowl, accompanied by a smaller bowl of fluffy steamed rice. The large chunk of white fish swam in the snug comfort of the rich red sauce, inviting, fragrant and full of eastern promise. My initial confusion as to how to manage the fluid dish (do I put the rice in the bowl with the fish, if so, how do I eat it with chop sticks?!) gave way to sheer joy at the lightly spiced, full flavour of the dish. The fish was delicate and perfectly cooked, lightly flavoured by the cooking process and excellently accompanied by the sauce. The sole criticism of the simply served dish, is that the unpretentious presentation of the fish on the bone, inevitably involved bones... If you're here on a first date, don't have this dish - picking bones out of your mouth isn't a good look!  Due to pre-wedding diet and time constraints, we decided to forego desserts, so this commentator cannot guide as to the quality of the finish. Next time, I will complete the task! Our bill arrived and I can honestly say that I have rarely been so pleasantly surprised by the inverse proportion of price to quality. The bill for two came in at about 24 including corkage - phenomenal, given that the meal was tasty, fresh, excellently executed and served with the homeliest, warmest and most genuine service I have experienced in Edinburgh for years.  In summary, I repeat - this secret will not be kept for long, so get yourself down to the Vietnam House now, before word gets out.",

    "text": "Finally a Vietnamese restaurant in Edinburgh! When I lived in the U.S. I was a regular eater of Vietnamese food. At least in the West Coast you will find a Vietnamese restaurant around every corner; and the quality is usually good and the food is very authentic. Pho Vietnam House in Edinburgh is not bad. I'm not surprised that it is very well-received by the public because it does deliver something different from the Chinese/Japanese/Thai dining scene (especially for people who have not eaten any Vietnamese food before). The lunch menu is good value for money. The food is pretty good, too. But they are a bit too sweet for my liking. The portion for the stew beef with rice is generous, but the pho is smaller than expected. You may feel hungry later if you only order the Pho. I wish the Pho Vietnam House would include tripe and meatballs in their Pho as it is what the traditional Pho is like. I know some Westerners don't eat tripe but it should at least be an option for people who really want a taste of authentic Vietnamese Pho. They also need to increase the portion for the Pho. Overall it's a good restaurant. I give it a 4-star. My only complaint is that the food tastes a bit too sweet.",

It was recommended on other reviews that we should phone ahead to book a table. We ate fairly early (6.30ish?) on a Monday, so booking probably wasn't actually necessary, but I'm sure it doesn't hurt.   We had some of the spring rolls which were excellent and came with a really nice sauce. While I was waiting for my main course, I was watching other people's food come out (don't tell my wife I got distracted from our conversation because of food), and each plate I saw only made my mouth water more and more. Finally, my ginger glazed catfish (i think that was what it was called) came and I was thoroughly pleased. Besides tasting amazing, it was served on a bed of coconut rice that I can almost taste as I write this. I kept trying to get that last bit of rice off of my plate with a fork once my chopstick skills eventually failed me.  My wife had some excellent pho, but was a bit jealous of my dish. But judging by everything I saw and/or tasted, I'm assuming it's all tasty and you're not going to be disappointed.   Seriously, you should come here... and why haven't you tried Vietnamese food yet?",

    "text": "On a chilly, drizzly day I headed to Vietnam House for a piping hot, filling bowl of pho. As it is apparently the only Vietnamese restaurant in Edinburgh, the House has a monopoly on the field and as such, sets their prices rather high (I overheard the server mention this to another diner, so clearly I'm not the only one who thinks this). Perhaps I'm spoiled, being from Seattle where pho is plentiful and cheap, but 6 for a small (and quite small indeed) bowl of pho is steep.  Not that the pho itself was bad. It was quite good, served with the requisite bean sprouts, basil leaves and chili sauce. The flavors were spot-on, and the veggies (I had veggie pho with chicken broth, yum) were plentiful. One minor complaint - the veggies and the noodles were chopped quite small, so if you're eating with chopsticks, it's a bit difficult to snare the tiny morsels. Of course, if you're eating with a spoon you'll be just fine. I just wanted bigger, more succulent bites!  The service was great - it's a tiny place with five tables total so there was only one server, and she was friendly and conversational. The space is well-decorated (with the girl's own paintings, I believe) and welcoming, and overall the House is a good option for a warming bowl of soup on a cold Edinburgh day.",

    "text": "Finally, a proper Vietnamese place in Edinburgh!  This small restaurant of only five tables has focussed on some some typical Vietnamese street food staples.  On my visited I we shared a plate if spring rolls which, in True Vietnamese style, were pleasantly crunchy with a minced pork and crab meat filling.  For mains I opted for Pho, the benchmark by which any Vietnamese place will be judged as far as I'm concerned. My partner had the Vietnamese fried rice.  The Pho Bo did not dissapoint. The broth was both tasty and aromatic and the beef tender. I would like to have seen it accompanied with a bigger side plate of herbs and a bottle of chilli sauce left on the table rather than a small dipping sauce size portion. Tailoring Pho to your own personal taste is half the fun.  The fried rice didn't seem any different from any other fried rice dish.  The menu also covered chicken rice porridge, curries, various noodle soups, fish and fried noodle dishes. Certainly enough to make this diner want to make a second visit.  On my visit someone picked up some take-away which is great if you've not been lucky enough to get a table.  All in all it's a great addition to the Edinburgh Asian dining scene. If they get some Vietnamese beer and get rid of the elevator muzak then I'll be a happy man.",

In a time honored tradition I will insult the UK tradition of expensive Christmas Dinners that leave you awkwardly sitting next to the one person at work you don't like, eating at a posh, yet not veggie friendly restaurant, drinking Tesco wine that has been upmarked so badly that you're *almost* considering staying sober for this weird, weird mix of people.   So, I present you with the best idea of all time. Pho Vietnam House Vietnamese Christmas Dinner. 1 corkage per person (with an inordinate amount of corks), and including starters that AREN'T ON THE MENU cause we're special MFing guests, ran us each around 15. That's just MONEY.   I won't even TELL YOU about the service. Ok, so I will because that's what this forum is for. It was so spectacular that I was ready - NO DID - give the waitress a hug at the end. She is so awesome and her mom is so awesome (made us Vietnamese Salads!). She remembered my NAME from my big graduation dinner, she remembered that I didn't eat beef, but that I did eat fish, and AS ALWAYS they made me my favorite off the menu item. There was 15 of us and she made sure we all had everything we wanted at every single second.   I just wish I could eat here every single night of my life.",

Maybe I've been spoilt by exceptional pho elsewhere in my life but I found the all important BROTH here underseasoned and just not the taste sensation I expect when I think of good pho.   The summer rolls had (for me) too much coriander and lettuce and not really enough protein. It just felt like I was eating coriander flavoured lettuce wrapped in rice paper... Not the delightfully light rolls I'm used to where you have the sweetness of carrot with the crunch of the lettuce to compliment either a prawn or pork filling.  Maybe they've upped their game in recent times and I should give them another bash but with the new Little Vietnam just further up the road, it's not looking very likely I shall be returning anytime soon...",

So maybe not the best choice if you have any OCD hygiene issues.  The menu is short and simple. They just do a few things, and from what we tasted, they do them extremely well. The soft spring rolls were gorgeous, and the pho had that delectable deceptively simple flavour that gets more complex with each mouthful. Really delicious and fragrant.  They don't serve booze but you can BYOB for 1 per bottle. But it's not really the sort of place to linger over a bottle of wine. Get in, get fed, get out.   I agree with Joe that it would be great if they moved somewhere bigger so they could expand the menu accordingly. I'd love to try some more dishes made with such skill. Unlike Thai and Malaysian, Vietnamese was one SE Asian cuisine that Edinburgh has been short on in recent years, but not anymore. This place is already an institution and is sure to grow from here.",

Also, since I've spent the last 5 years in Germany, my idea of what constitutes good service is all out of whack. That said...  Yum! This place is small and personality-filled and serves tasty Vietnamese food. I'm already a fan. The vegetarian fried noodles were delicious and filling. Looking forward to trying the spring rolls and pho on future visits.  It's BYOB (something I'm going to have to get used to here), but there's a small liquor shop around the corner so it's easy to grab a bottle of wine while you wait for your order to come. 1.50 corkage fee per person.",

It makes me wish there were a couple more places like this Edinburgh, but I will be going back here for sure!   Don't let the photo on here fool you. It is really rather small, and probably advisable to book, there is only about 5 tables?! When I first saw the menu I was a little disappointed at the lack of choice, but thought I would give it a go anyway!   Fresh vegetable spring rolls. These have got to be the tastiest spring rolls I have had. They were also a bit of a mind f**k...... they are COLD!?!? And they aren't fried!?!?!? And they come served with this kick ass peanut sauce. I was in heaven. Spring rolls that are tasty and healthy!? Give me another 6!  I then had the fried pho noodles with seafood. I was ravenous, and this was delicious. As quickly as you can say 'pho' my plate was clean, and I mean seriously, like full on, every last mouthful....... and someone else's leftovers clean! Prawns, Veg, Noodles, Squid, Chilli Sauce..... a total winner in my books.  Only criticism is the size of the restaurant and the fact that they don't sell booze. You can bring your own so I will remember that for next time! And the service. It was fine, but just fine.",

We ended up here a couple of times during our stay in Edinburgh, and the food quality was good both times, but there was a huge difference in service. It's more important to me that a place has great food, which is what my rating reflects. I would have given the service during our first visit a 3 or 4 stars and a 1 or 2 stars during the second visit. However, the staff was really trying, they are just short staffed.   The place is small and they do take reservations, so I recommend making one. If you go earlier, the service will be better because they do struggle when they get busy.   I'm a creature of habit when it comes to food and when I find something I like, I'll continue to order it, so while we went twice, we only sampled the Fried Spring Rolls, Fresh Spring Rolls, Pho w/ Beef and Fried Noodles w/ Seafood. All of it was delicious, which is why I had the same thing on the subsequent visit to the restaurant.   This is definitely a place I will return to when I'm in Edinburgh again.",

    "text": "Pho Vietnam House had been on my radar since my trip to Vietnam last summerr, though it is a little far off. Every so often I crave some broth-based noodle soup, usually ramen suffices, last night it didn't.   The setting was quite modest but cosy. Dim lighting, simple decor. The full tables were a good sign.   My partner and I went straight for the pho. I got Pho Chay (vegetarian chay), he got beef. My chay came loaded with vegetables, fried tofu and those lovely herbs like lemongrass, cloves and coriander. Fresh mint, beansprouts and limes were on the table, along with sriracha sauce. The portion size was generous, as it should be (noodle soup=comfort food), the food was delicious and relatively inexpensive.   To finish we opted for the coconut ice cream which came served in a coconut shell. Yum.  If I were in Edinburgh for longer, I would come back regularly to get my Pho fix. Too bad they don't offer banh mi too.",

    "text": "NOMNOMNOMNOM  Well, this was delicious, and I must say that I commend the waitress for controlling our greedy guts. We are the type of office that has a 'birdtable' we all eat off of constantly, if we see food we will eat it. When we tried to order an extraordinary number of rolls for starters the waitress decided that she would bring them in smaller numbers and not allow any more be cooked until we had finished that batch.   We needed this kind of control, we are weak, we would have eaten every single one if she had put them in front of us!  I tried both the fresh and the fried spring rolls. Both were delicious, the fresh came with peanut sauce and was like eating the sea (I'm no poet, give me a break!) and the fried came with a spicy sauce that complimented the meaty contents really well.  I had the Vietnemese Noodles with Seafood for my main and it was delicious. I enjoyed every bite. I was worried there would be too much aniseed but the taste was perfect, for me who has had Vietnamese food only a handful of times.  The waitress is a gem, that's all I'll say.",

    "text": "I love Vietnamese food, especially pho, and have been missing it ever since I leave the US. I had found this place and meant to try it for ages, finally getting around to it yesterday, it did not disappoint! Tucked away from Haymarket, they don't have very many seats and were nice enough to fit us in without a reservation. The staff was very lovely and attentive, and it is a very quirky little space with mix-matched decor, it feels like someone's house rather then a restaurant.  We ordered the vegetarian spring rolls to start with the veggie pho and the rare beef pho as our mains. I noted they also have vietnamese coffee, which I've heard is delicious, so I will have to try that next time! The spring rolls came soon after we ordered, and although it says 3 on the menu, she asked if we wanted 4 so we could have 2 each. They are so fresh tasting, and delicious with little bits of fried tofu and a yum peanut sauce, just as I had hoped!  The pho came not long after they collected the spring rolls plates and looked absolutely perfect. The veggie one was full of pak choy, carrots, broccoli, tofu and mushrooms. It was so fragrant and delicious, it is so not fair that you can't make this broth at home. I could eat pho several times a week and be happy. It was an enormous bowl and after a slow chow through all the great veg and noodles, I had the broth. My boyfriend enjoyed the beef and it was indeed put into the bowl rare with mushrooms and lots of fresh herbs.   It was fairly quiet as it was only 6 pm when we arrived, but as we were leaving people were piling in. I would think you should always book. All the food that came past while we were there looked fresh and well-made so we will definitely going back, as it isn't expensive and is a fresh and healthy option.",

    "text": "Wow, I did not see that coming!  An immediate new entry into Joey's Top 5 Edinburgh Eats, Pho Vietnam had been on my radar for a while, and the reason my workmates and I chose the venue was because we had pub quiz winnings of a bottle of vodka and a crate of beer to share. But I did not expect the sheer quality of the food on display here.  The first positive sign was that as a BYoB, Pho Vietnam did not have any limits. Many BYoBs tend to apply that rule specifically to wine, but we rocked up with a litre of Smirnoff and they didn't bat an eyelid. No problemo.  The menu is modestly small, offering only two starters, both of which a variation of Spring Roll; the Fresh veggie option served with Peanut Sauce, or the crispier Fried alternative, stuffed (and I do mean stuffed!) with meat and served with sweet chilli sauce. Both were fantastic, large in body and a generous 4 rolls per helping, but the winner (of course) was the meat option.  Next I chose the Braised Pork in Caramel Sauce with boiled rice. A fantastically rich and sweet dish, supernova moreish and so so succulent, with ingredients such as star anise included in the thick sauce.  But Joey being Joey didn't stop there, and I managed to attract a taster of several other dishes around the table. The winning dish of the night was Linda C's Catfish. Absolutely epic course and without doubt my next choice when I go back. Rachel's Chicken with Fried Rice was the best chicken fried rice I've ever had, and Sinead's Chicken Curry looked like a subtle korma, but delivered and amazing punch of heat.  There was no loser in the food stakes. Everything was gorgeous.  The venue is tiny, to the point you need to pass through the middle of the kitchen to get to the toilet. This only makes it a rarity and I hope they do enough business to expand in the same vein as Kampung Ah Lee, there's no reason why they shouldn't because the quality of food here is tough to beat.   Prices are very reasonable considering the quality offered. I only hope they do expand so they can also enhance their menu (the limited space I think must contribute to the limited selection). In the meantime I am happy to go back again and again and work my way through that delectable menu.  Winner winner, chicken dinner!",

Shared the Fresh spring rolls appetizers and mains were the lemongrass pork chops and chicken - yum.   Next door table had Pho. Looked good - incl. raw meat style that cooks itself in the broth on the menu - so may need to bring hubby next time we come to visit Edinburgh.   BYOB a bonus - if only I knew!",

Service was great, if you plan or going with a group or even during the usual busy times it would be a good idea to book ahead.",
