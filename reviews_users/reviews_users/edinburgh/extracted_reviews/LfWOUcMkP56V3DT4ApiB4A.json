The hot salsa tastes like there is bbq sauce in it. We had to throw it away. The staff was friendly. Don't go here for decent take away food.",

    "text": "Is it my elitism claiming I'm from Southern California with a plethora of Mexican friends, or is this place really just that terrible (to warrant a 1 star rating)?  First off, my quesadilla. I ordered chicken (because they were out of shredded pork). It was dry as a bone, and they literally burned the tortilla, to the point that it was black. If you are unable to make a simple quesadilla, what hope do you have?  I also ordered a side of chips. The \"nacho cheese\" was served room temperature, and tasted of incorrectly prepared Velveeta cheese log. Stay away, Scots and tourists. This is the first time I have ever longed for the \"good taste\" of \"Mexican\" fast food",

    "text": "Good Mexican food for being in Scotland. Similar to chipotle but with a few variations.  I really enjoyed find a place with lots of seating, vegetables and quick food service. It was perfect for the end of my visit to the city when I got tires of eating every meal in a sit down restaurant that would take 2hrs per meal. It was quick and good and the first thing with any spice in it during my entire trip to Scotland.",
