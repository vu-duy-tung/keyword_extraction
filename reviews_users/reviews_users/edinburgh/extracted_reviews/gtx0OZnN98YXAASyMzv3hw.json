    "text": "I came here with Jenny L for a catch up dinner and to try out this tucked-away restaurant up Bruntsfield way. I went for a bowl of soup for starters, the veggie mezze platter for mains with a side of chips. I was too stuffed for pudding!   The food here is home-made, fresh and unusual. My soup was very tasty - barley broth if I remember correctly - and was meant to come with kidney something or other (except it didn't as the kitchen was out). So an odd and interesting combo. And very nice too!  The mezze platter was weirdness personified, but not in a bad way. I've never seen a mezze plate like it (see pics!). There were some very, very strong flavours and everything struck me as just a bit out of left field. The baba ganoush was extremely smoky, there were pickled carrots that tasted like coffee and hard-boiled eggs that had something extra added. It was an odd plate of food. Just a bit weird.... I kept calling my plate the David Lynch of dinners, haha. And it was!   I would definitely come back here to try more of the menu and find out what oddities and delights await my palate...",

    "text": "Oh man, I hate it when I'm the one who disagrees. All these 4 and five stars...  Not for me. And three stars is perfectly good, and it sums up my feeling, as well as the Silent Reviewer. We went there for a celebratory 'at last I have a job and can spend money frivolously' meal on a - I do not jest - heaving Saturday night. The previous table occupants were finishing up when we arrived, and due to the small venue space, we had to stay outside in the rain (luckily, there was some handy scaffolding on the night of our visit). When I meant busy, I really meant it.   We were tucked away in the corner, so much that the SR couldn't see the specials board (I *just about* could), and our waitress kindly read everything out (the service here is excellent) and settled for a beef noodle starter special, as well as salt and pepper prawns for me. As we were in a romantic mood, we went for the sharing tom yum vegetable curry for our main.   We were starving, so shared some bread, with the 3bird dukkah - which involves a comical attempt at trying to squash large chunks of hazelnut and pistachio onto some bread. It's the first time I tried dukkah, and liked the aniseedy flavours coming out, but for me, it didn't quite come together as much as I expected, but the smoked shallot vinagrette was an absolute winner.   The salt and pepper prawns were fantastic, although I didn't feel that the aioli tasted more of mayonnaise than miso or kombu seaweed. As the SR noted, it makes a difference when you have someone who is able to cook in the kitchen versus a quick grab from a local takeway - the batter on the prawns was impossibly light and beautifully flavoured. His beef noodles were consumed, but not commented upon.   The tom yum curry was... nice. Served with flatbread and rice, which was also... nice. I had one of those moments when we ordered that I should have ordered the market fish, but we went for the curry. Curries, and stews, I think, tend to struggle in restaurants to rise above the ordinary, and for me, this didn't quite make it. It fell into - I can make this at home - category. I did, however, like the touch of adding extra fresh chilli and lime (never can get enough lime) on the side.   So - you may ask why, if I think the service is excellent, and some of the food fantastic, why 3 stars? Simply because it wasn't all excellent, and some was simply nice. And there is nothing wrong with nice, and nice means a solid restaurant, but neither of left raving about our meal. Perhaps I really should have had the fish.",

    "text": "This place is fabulous! I came here for date night with my beau and I cannot stop thinking about this place since! It's quite small and intimate with beautiful art work and lighting. The staff were polite and good natured. They also had great recommendations on food or wine selections. It is a bit pricey, so if you're looking for cheap this might not be the place. If you're looking for a sit-down meal with quality ingredients, great staff, and good atmosphere, this is your spot.   We started off with crispy pig ears. AMAZING. It was exactly how I expected and perfect with a touch of sea salt. My beau had never experienced the texture and flavour before but he loved it. Then we moved on to our appetisers. I had the seared pigeon breast with picked pear. The pigeon breast was cooked so slightly and delicious, we really enjoyed the slightly earthly but light taste. My beau enjoyed the fig and goat cheese wrap sitting very deliciously on top of a beetroot yogurt. We both love fig and the goat cheese thus the combination was mind blowing. For our mains, we had the grilled seam bream and the special, grilled seatrout over a bed of couscous. Both dishes were cooked to perfection and filled with flavour. For dessert, we loved the Rocky road ice cream sundae. It was a bit unexpected and a little difficult for me to share but alas, we loved it.   We loved the wines as well. For starters we had the col di sotto pinot grigio and finished with the Francesca Bay Pinot noir. Both excellent with our meals.   Again, highly recommend this restaurant and I am already demanding that we go back!",

    "text": "A-may-zing!  The boyfriend and I were looking for somewhere to have lunch to celebrate us having put up with each other for five whole years, and Three Birds immediately sprung to mind. It's in an area of town that we haven't visited recently, but used to frequent in the earlier years of our relationship (alas, moving to Leith two years ago has meant we've neglected Tollcross and Bruntsfield recently) so it offered both the chance for a big old nostalgia trip and for some delicious food. And it was a good choice!  Lunchtime on a Monday meant that the restaurant was quiet, we were only joined by a table of ladies who lunch and one tourist, but that was a good thing as food and drinks were served promptly (and with a smile).  I'd already ear-marked (ho ho ho) the Crispy Pigs' Ears with aioli and sea salt, having seen them on their menu online, and was excited to try them given they're not something you typically see on menus. They were really nice, crispy and flavoursome, with the aioli and salt being perfect accompaniments.  Sure, the thicker pieces were a bit chewy but you are eating ear so what do you expect?  We opted for the two-course lunch for 9.95, starter and mains, with boyfriend going for the bbq pork belly and myself for the lamb kofta for starters. Mmmmmmm! Both were the right side of spicy and full of flavour, I could easily have eaten a bigger serving. And I loved the two toasted pittas my kofta was served with, perfect for scooping up any remaining chickpea and tomato sauce.  As for mains, well neither of us could see beyond the beef cheeks in porter, with roast potatoes and shallots. Absolutely delicious, easily the nicest thing either of us have eaten in a long time. The cheeks were beyond tender, melt-in-the-mouth, and to die for.  I also ordered a salad to keep things healthy, which came attractively decorate with petals!  We didn't have pudding, as we had a film to catch, but we will definitely be back to sample more of their delicious wares. Especially given how good value everything is, two courses for less than a tenner is fab! And our 500ml carafe of white wine was nicely priced at 8.  So, go go go to Three Birds! You won't regret it.",

    "text": "Went here with my friends to test out the new taster menu before the official launch of Three Birds. (Half-off, woo!)  First impressions: Similar layout to the previous restaurant Le Mouton Noir, but a bit lightened up. Great intimate and cosy vibes with approximately 9 tables. Also worth mentioning that the staff are all delightful and really knowledgable to the new menu. You would have thought they had been working there for a while.   The menu looked delectable, and as a result we took some time in deciding. Our waitress was very attentive and enjoyed answering our questions with enthusiasm.   There was a great mix on the menu. There is a decent selection of bites/sides along with starters and mains (about 4 or so) with a few specials on the boards.   We went for:   - Pigs ears with salt and aioli (see photo) - Large Vegetarian Mezze platter with goodies such as curried lentils, kimchi, oatcakes and hummus, pickled egg with beetroot, some sort of beetroot coleslaw, amazing spicy sweet potato cakes, and Asian cucumber. All displayed on a wooden board to share. (see photo)  - The special of oxcheeks with a star anise jus. This was a bit small. The portion was lacking for the price.   Mains we got:  - Eggs ontop of tomato sauce with pine nuts, goats cheese, and flat bread. This was delicious, really enjoyed it as an interesting lunch. Nice and hot and presented in a frying pan (see photo)  - Chicken thigh with rocket and tomato slices. It was expected that we pita chips in the salad were to be crispy, however they arrived a bit soggy. There was also an absence of balsamic on the salad, when the menu clearly stated the dressing was to contain my friend's favourite vinegar. Though, the waitress promptly brought over a small carafe with balsamic to drizzle atop the chicken salad when asked. Was a struggle to cut the chicken into smaller pieces because the bowl was quite small, however the flavours were an appealing balance of lemon with sweetness of the tomatos. - Smoked mackerel on a baguette. Looked delightful however could have used an extra piece of bread. A bit small for a main.   Overall I'll be back. This was week 1 and it was delightful. I can't wait to see how they progress with their menu and frequent this local when I can!   p.s they have Wi-Fi!",

    "text": "I'm very pleased to report that this was the best meal we had in Edinburgh, and it was my choice for my fiance's birthday dinner.  Out of all the places we went in town, this is the one where we'd go back.  Started off on a great note when we arrived bang on time for our reservation and were told that unfortunately the table wasn't ready.  Yes, a great note, because just wait - they recommended a great bar for us down the street, said to come back in 15 minutes, and they'd give us a free bottle of wine on our return.  Winner!  Can't even be mad!  That is an example of fine service.  So when we came back later, we were seated right away, and given a bottle of the Montepulciano which the (I think owner?) recommended.  The small restaurant was warm and dimly lit, and buzzing with people.  Clearly the locals know what's up - this place is nowhere near the main tourist drag.  We felt lucky to be there.  We struggled mightily over what to order.  It all sounded amazing!  After much deliberation, we started with Crab, Peanut, and Caramel Coated Chicken Wings (yes, crab), and then the 3 Birds and Beasts Platter - basically the reason I'd made the reservation in the first place.  The chicken wings were amazing.  Extremely crisp on the outside, hot and juicy on the inside, with gorgeous and exotic flavors.  Reminiscent of Thai or Vietnamese food maybe, faint hint of fish sauce, but in a really good way.  A very inspired combination.  Then the main event - a platter of pulled pork cutlet, star anise ox cheek, tomato Cajun beef ribs, fried chicken, a big bag of fries, BBQ bacon beans, mustard slaw, and 2 ketchups.  PHEW.    The pulled pork cutlet blew my mind.  It's pulled pork, reshaped into a patty and then I guess baked or fried?  It looks nothing like pulled pork until you stick a fork in it, then all the delicious meat comes spilling out.  It was incredibly tender and flavorful, easily some of the best we've had worldwide, including Amurrrica.  The ox cheek was incredibly rich and aromatic - don't save it for last, since it's the richest piece of meat and harder to eat when you're full!  Fall-apart tender.  The beef ribs were excellent as well, and the chicken was good though our least favorite of the bunch.  Perhaps because everything else was so inspired, the chicken just didn't stand out?  But it was tasty though!  I just think boneless fried chicken is morally wrong.  The fries were hot, crispy, and abundant.  I also really enjoyed the sides - beans were made from black eyed peas and were delicious, as was the slaw.  Both a nice accompaniment to the meal!  Somehow, we finished it all and managed to order dessert - the Rocky Road.  Peanut butter and strawberry jam ice cream (YES) with a big piece of chocolate studded with marshmallows, Turkish delight, and shortbread (YESYESYES)!  SO GOOD YOU GUYS.  The ice cream blew my mind.  The staff brought it out with a little candle for my fiance's birthday.  I assume his birthday wish was to always eat food this good.  And it's really really really affordable for the quality.  Like, stunningly.  Not including our wine, we paid maybe 44 for the meal, if I remember correctly.  And the wine would have been only 20 if we hadn't got it for free.  That's a crazy price for an appetizer to share, a huge entree, and dessert to share.  Given how pricey some places in the tourist area can get, for far worse food, as far as I'm concerned this is the place to be in Edinburgh.  I don't think we will ever come back to town and not here!  It's worth the long walk (or short cab ride) from town, because everything is just knock-your-socks-off good.",

Unfortunately on eating here a few times this has always been backed up as the food can be good but I don't feel it's value for money. Fries are served in quirky paper bags (my friend loves this, me not so keen), it's quite a small place so be warned you can feel very close to your fellow diners and it does fill up. However you've got to give them credit as they definitely try and push boundaries with their flavour combinations it's just that I think they don't always succeed in pulling it off. Desserts are very hit and miss and I've yet to have one that I could finish (and I'm a finisher!). My friend really likes the place but even she questions some of the dishes. So, would look out for their taster events but wouldn't recommend paying full whack.",

While a little out of city center, Three Birds seems like a must when visiting Edinburgh. The restaurant is quaint and small but the overall \"vibe\" really worked for me. The entire restaurant is maybe 10 tables with 2-3 servers assisting who were all very attentive and polite.  We started out with sourdough with butter/oils which was very good and fresh. For a starter we also split the seared scallops with brown butter aioli and blood orange. This is the first time I've ever had a \"whole scallop\" as I'm used to the common preparation of only eating what I believe is the adductor muscle. Anyway, interesting to try another part with a different texture. The aioli was unique and the blood orange really added to the flavors.  For mains, we had the pork loin and chicken supreme. Both were FANTASTIC. The chicken supreme is stuffed with a spicy Italian sausage that has a great kick to it. The chicken was juicy with great flavor. I was really impressed with the pork loin as I feel it's a dish that can easily be messed up. But it was cooked perfectly with a pink center. A blue cheese and white wine sauce accompanied it. While it may be considered \"bland\" on its own, it really added to the pork perfectly. There were also caramelized apples with the veggies that i just love to have with pork.  For dessert, there is a regular menu but do yourself a favor and ask for the ice cream/sorbet list. Our choices included black currant with black cherry sorbet, orange with ginger sorbet, and strawberry with lemon Fro-Yo. So refreshing for the end of the meal.   Overall, great service and amazing food!",

I'm usually vegetarian but have wandered over to the other side here and haven't been at all disappointed... they even offer vegan options if meat/fish isn't your preference. I've been here for breakfast lunch and dinner and it never disappoints. Highly recommended... one of the best restaurants I've been to in edinburgh in the past few years! Only note is it is a small restaurant- which I love- but if you're a big party I'd consider booking as well if you want to dine on the weekends (because Yes, it is that good).",

The staff is incredibly friendly, and service is speedy without being intrusive. I've always had classic starters there, scallops, calamari, and they are cooked to perfection, with a special shout out to the scallops! The mains offer classic dishes with a delicious variety of preparations that really demonstrate the creativity and skill of the kitchen, e.g. Duck breast served on lentil dahl with rhubarb kimchi. Then the desserts are equally delicious, but their ice creams are what shine, with strange and delicious combinations like white chocolate and horseradish or orange and ginger. Absolutely recommended, and actually not too shabby for student celebrating a special occasion. Try the pig ears in the side!",

This is a busy restaurant and I'm guessing you always need a booking to come here - we were dining on a Monday night and the place was pretty much full. The menu is very meaty (as the name of the restaurant would suggest) but there are some veggie/vegan options like tofu pakora, veggie mezze platter and a delicious salad main of roast squash.   We ordered some platters to share between us: the 3 Birds & Beasts platter, and the Big Cow platter (between 5 people). For me the stand out was the big cow platter, the meat was delicious and it came with a generous amount of sides like greens, mushrooms, bone marrow, sauces and fries. I also really liked the southern fried chicken from the 3 Birds platter.   All up, this is a place with delicious cooking in a chilled environment with friendly service. Just don't put your napkin too close to the candle, it's pretty embarrassing.",

We had, had an excellent meal at Field last year and I was a bit unsure as to where she would find that would trump that... Well, Three Birds had a cracking good go.   We jumped in a cab from the G&V and initially the guy who ordered us the cab had no idea where we the Three Birds was. Luckily, I had the venue bookmarked for handy address finding and after arming the driver with the info we zoomed out way to Viewforth.   This is a twee looking little place, with a bright exterior and big windows. It's very cosy inside with enough seating to create a fun atmosphere when full, but not so many people that it becomes noisy.   After enjoying a couple of glasses of rather fine wine, I opted for the beetroot soup to start (this was a winner with the shredded chicken) and me and Jody B. shared a \"Birds and Beasts\" platter for mains. I really hadn't needed a starter. There was more than enough food to feed three people, let alone two after starters. The steak and pulled pork were the stars of the show for me, but everything was really good.  I couldn't manage a dessert, but these looked great regardless! The service and food was spot on and it was a great choice for a fun, but not too stuffy, meal out with our team.",

    "text": "Yay I'm a fan describes my feelings about this restaurant well.  My boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner after it was highly recommended by a work colleague (her girlfriend is the head chef so I had high hopes!). The restaurant is small, even by Edinburgh standards so booking is essential. There's maybe enough tables to seat about 20 but it's a cosy atmosphere not w cramped one. The service staff seemed helpful and our waitress was definitely super friendly which made the evening a really nice experience.  We kept things simple and ordered the feta and pistachio dip and bread with dukkah and oils to share while we waited for our birds and beast platter. The feta dip was incredibly moreish to the point I'll need to try and recreate it at home. The bread with oils was tasty as well but the feta just really stood out. After a bit of a wait our platter arrived and I wish is taken a photo as this was no small feat ahead of us! The platter is made for two to share but could easily feed four as there's two hearty portions of everything. The platter had piri piri chicken wings, slow cooker ox cheek, a pulled pork croquette, beef shin with wasabi grilled cheese, baked beans, and Asian coleslaw. For someone who's not a massive meat eater I was a bit overwhelmed and barely made it through half of my portion.  Everything was super tasty with a nice spicy kick but I was just defeated. Thankfully the waitress offered to wrap up any leftovers we wanted so I got to take home my chicken wings and ox cheek.   After a bit of a rest we shared the cheese platter for pudding with a peppermint tea for me and an amaretto coffee for the boyfriend. The cheese is from Mellis so it was of a standard I'd expect and the chutney was quite nice as well.  After a super filling evening we paid and left to waddle ourselves home. I definitely enjoyed three birds and will be back to try other items on their menu but I think it would help a lot if they cut down the size of their sharing platters as they're just too big for two people.",

But take the leap of faith and they will always deliver.   The menu changes every few months and the specials change daily. Everything sounds amazing, and I am legitimately saddened knowing that I can't try them all. The restaurant itself is cosy and has tasteful, semi-hipster decor. The prices are quite reasonable - wine for under 5 and any appetizer/entree combination for 10. The staff is always polite and friendly. My only complaint: they kept us waiting quite a while before we got the bill, even though they had cleared all our plates.   We live down the street from Three Birds and walk past it every day. I have never seen it empty, and I don't expect I ever will.",

The setting is quaint, paired with proper service and passionate food. Everyone very much enjoyed their food: various apps, a seafood platter, cauliflower tacos and for myself, the chicken supreme. I'm sure it's a combination of the pleasant staff, the overall ambience and a tasty craft ale (Ka Pai), but the chicken supreme was simply put: inspiring. Rarely do I send a message back to the chef after my entree, but tonight I couldn't resist. It was easily one of the best mains I've had this year. We wrapped the meal with the Summer Mess and flat white's, which were a great finish. The food, the staff, the setting, the chicken supreme: brilliant. Simply brilliant. Thank you, Three Birds.",

The dishes consisted of high quality ingredients and were beautifully presented; I would have expected to pay much more. The lunch special includes two courses for 12 pounds, which I felt was very reasonable. My husband and I shared the ox tongue starter and two mains: The smoked portobello mushroom (served with a potato pancake, poached egg, and rich gruyere cheese) and seafood tomato broth (sort of like a cioppino but in a white broth instead of red). I'm not usually a fan of fried food, but the ox tongue sounded exotic and its accouterments were tasty. For me, our mains were both equal highlights. The service was great; our cheery and polite waiter checked in with us regularly, and the meal was well-paced. If we were locals, this would be a go-to dining experience for our lunch and dinner dates out.",

I can understand that the low lights and living room sized area can be cosy and intimate but I travel with a more than travel sizes SO, he's all legs and there was no where for him to go. He also comes with a giant coat (roughly the size of a 1 person tent) which he hung on the back of his chair meaning he was taking up more room than the venue really allowed for.   That, however, was the only minus! Apart from the size the restaurant is bordering on adorable. A nice mix of rustic and kitschy makes it quite comfortable and relaxing. There are bird motifs throughout though the main artworks, which are place high so as not to be overwhelming, are mainly pictures of animals one might like to eat (stay tuned for how I ate them all).  We were given time to look through the menu which was jam packed with such delicious and interesting looking dishes! We settled on beetroot and seatrout (me) and celeriac and apple soup (him) for starters. I also threw in some pigs ears which were so tasty!  For mains we shared the 3birds and beasts platter for two people (36) which was ah may zing. A giant wooden board was presented that was overflowing with fantasticness. There was a pulled pork miso ball which came in a sauce that tasted BBQ sauce-ish. There were piri piri chicken wings with some light sauce. There was ox cheek cooked in aniseed. There was a sandwich with ox shin and wasabi. There was beans and bacon. There was coleslaw. There was chips. There was two full and happy bellies!  The amount of food was a little overwhelming and I'm ashamed to admit it bested me!   That said, dessert belly was ready for a delicious take on a mess with vodka soaked cherries and Kahlua cream while across from me a delicious Baileys latte was enjoyed.  The food was fantastic, but so was the service. Our waitresses were conscientious and polite. It was definitely service with a smile.  A meat lovers paradise (though plenty of veggie alternatives were spied on the menu) that is worthy of your attention!",

For starter I opted for the pigeon breast on a bed of peas and pine nuts. Simple cooking and really delicious. The pigeon was pink, juicy and so tender. Winter might be coming but at least that means game birds are back on the menu yuuuum!!.  For main out of a table of 14, 11 of us went for the same thing!!! The steak special cooked in a bone marrow butter. OH LORD....... I had mine rare and as well as being perfectly cooked the flavour was incredible. The marrow flavour was there to be enjoyed. Superb.

Service was great as well. Although the resturant was packed, our waiter was very attentive to our needs and also offered to replace one of my friend's appetizer when the taste came out not as we have expected (forgot what it's called but it was some super salty fish).

We have never had any issue with anything - the food is always delicious and the service is some of the best I have had anywhere in the UK. I especially love that they dont give me a hassle when it comes to my dairy allergy. If a dish has a creamy side, they always allow me to just swap it out for something non-dairy without any problems. Thumbs up!  The Birds and Beasts platter continues to be our go-to order and its nice that they change up what they have on it so we dont end up having the same thing over and over. Whenever I order fish it is always a generous portion and the sides are always something tasty and interesting. Also, hats off to their amazing dessert selection, especially their extensive ice cream and sorbet menu. I recently had a plum and black pepper sorbet that would knock your socks off. Delicious stuff.",
