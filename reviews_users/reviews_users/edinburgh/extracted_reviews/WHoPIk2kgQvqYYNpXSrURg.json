    "text": "This is a restaurant but I opted for a take away. This was the first time I tried this place and was a bit apprehensive but while I was in ordering the phone was going so often for deliveries that the man serving me barely got a chance to take my order which I took as a good sign.   I thought the portions were a sensible size and I think I can be quite specific with how I want my curries, and I'm pleased to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this one. We also ordered a naan bread which was massive and they threw in a free side order which was interesting because it was a dish I had never tasted.   The price was good and if you take the set meal offers it is really worth your while.   There are hundreds of take aways around this area of the city but I will definately return here.",

My naan was burnt, the rice was dry and tasteless, my friend's chipatti was just floury nonsense.   Don't bother coming here.",

    "text": "I originally gave this place 5 stars, but last time they sent out 2 people who didn't understand english to my table, but they were pretending as if they did understand me. I don't mind if their english is poor, but I'd prefer the honesty of their staff. My mango lasse was messed up because of the communication problem, even though I was told that they did understand what I wanted, as I had very specific questions about it. They also were late giving me my drink as it came after the main cource, and not even before or during the appetizer. Also, the samosas I got were black and crunchy in the middle, almost as if they were exposed to a freezer, then dry rotted, or the inside was burned somehow as the outside seemed fine. The second order of samosas came back o me frozen, so that's 2 times they messed that up. I do like the fact that their portions are decent, and the main courses were great, and I do remember really good experiences with this restaurant about a year prior to my bad experiences. I am giving them 3 stars because a long time ago they were great, but sems like they are going downhill a bit. I'm just being homest.",

    "text": "I know that Indian takeaways are ten a penny in Edinburgh but this is one of the best that I have tried anywhere. I may be kidding myself but I think the curries taste fresher (and hopefully less fatty!) than typical takeaways. I particularly love the Chicken Palak which has loads of flavour. The portions are a good size and the side orders are tasty. They also usually give you a free side order if you order two meals which I think is a nice touch. Delivery usually takes 30-40 minutes for the Leith area which is pretty average for a takeaway but I think these curries are a cut above the average takeaway.",
