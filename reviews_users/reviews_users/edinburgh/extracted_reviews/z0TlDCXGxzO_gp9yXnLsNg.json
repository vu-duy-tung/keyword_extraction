I had scrambled egg on toast which was very rubbery but the bread was lovely. Others were having Greek food which looked miles better than mine. The smoothies are fab and I recommend the 'go coconut' one. Olly's isn't cheap but it's cute and useful for students as it's right next to the Edinburgh uni campus. Might come again but more likely to try other cafes in the area due to price.",

It was perfectly made with the egg just a tad runny in the center. Now I can attest to both the food and the coffee!",

I remembered that we had been wanting to try the food at Olly Bongos for far too long. Quick check of the menu before entering and we opted for a sharing meze plate.   We were greeted by a friendly waiter on arrival, who gave us a choice of seats even though the place was quite busy. I always like getting the option rather than being told where to sit, so thumbs up from the start. We ordered there and then, mainly due to the hunger that only a hangover gives you.   Looking around the decor was nice -  mediterranean feel and posters advertising music nights. This looks good so far. The coffee appeared and it was rather good, not brilliant but better than most. The food was with us quite quickly and we had a Smorgasbord board of amazing treats. The tzatziki and roasted aubergine dishes were excellent. There was so much we couldn't finish. for the price this is a bargain.  It's always a good sign when you leave somewhere and you are think why haven't I eaten here before. It's in my 'hood, the food caters for both of us and service is great. I will be back many times over.",

The cashier lady was clearly ashamed but didn't say much. They took 10% off from the bill which is something but they should not have charged for the dish at all.

You'd walk right past it and write it off as it doesn't look like much from the outside, but if you step through the doors it's likely you'll get a different impression entirely.   The cafe is decorated in a Turkish/middle eastern theme and I always opt for their dishes from the region. Mezze plate for the win! (See my photo as evidence backing up that excited statement.) The food is really tasty, portioned generously and served with a smile.   Haven't gotten around to the cakes yet. Another excuse to visit some time soon!

With no expectations but just hungry bellies, we ventured inside.   The exterior is quaint and homely and we were met by lovely aromas and friendly, welcoming staff. We went for chilli nachos to share and thought it would be something that would just do the job. - Something moderately priced, share-able and that would keep us busking in to the night.  We were given a generous portion of nachos with humous, guacamole, creme fraiche, salsa and chilli. It was full of flavour and certainly hit the spot! If in need of food when in the area, I'll be back!",

A nice selection of scatter cushions and enough space between tables.   The menu was supplied and we were advised what we could order. A sharing mezze starter with a pitta bread each was very tasty and I like the fresh yoghurt sauce.  However main course my chicken shish-kebab surprised me as it was smaller than I expected it to be. It wasn't shish-kebabed - it was 6 loose pieces of (very tasty and moist) chicken and some Pitta bread. I felt more like a tiny taster / starter portion than an actual main course.   The 'included' wine was supplied in small sampling glasses - you know those that fit 2 bowls of icecream and that is it. But when asked for medium size of the same whine we got some proper sized glasses. - was it because we actually paid proper prices for that instead of a groupon voucher?   Service was attentive and efficient enough seeing how busy it was and  the waitress was by herself.  - Although bringing out a main BEFORE you clear the starters is in every restaurant a 'no, no'.   We got a nice Turkish coffee afterwards.   In all it was not bad, nice enough but nothing special.",

It came with houmous, cous cous, stuffed vine leaves, olives and roasted vegetables plus some toasted pitta bread. It was all good, great flavours and the plate was finished quickly.  For main course I chose a mixed kebab (chicken and lamb). What was offered was about 3 pieces of chicken and 2 small minced lamb patties. Again, it was all very flavourful - but I cannot help but wonder if this was a 'voucher portion'. The price you would pay for this dish is 8.90 and I think you can get a bit more for your money's worth elsewhere (quantity wise).   The wine (merlot) that we drank with this meal was very nice and we asked for more wine.. large glass. Now the drinks seem more reasonable. Large glass of red for 3.50.   The meal was finished with a turkish coffee, which was nice but nothing exceptional. However, I think I would come here again, maybe for a lunch time snack as the food is tasty.",

There are always three different soups on every day - two of which are veggie - but the lentil and bacon never fails. I have eaten here several times, both for breakfast and for lunch, and i would struggle to say which one is better as both are consistently tasty and good value for money.  For breakfast, for those with larger appetites i'd recommend the Breakfast Bagel (5.95) which comes stacked high with crispy bacon, beans and a fried egg; or for those wanting a slightly healthier start to the day then the Light Bagel with smoked salmon and cream cheese, or the generous portion of granola with fresh fruit and yogurt is definitely worth trying.  Despite it's location right next to the University campus, this cafe is popular with students and non-students alike, and its easy to see why.   Don't miss... the Multi-Vit Smoothie (2.95) with kiwi, strawberry, banana and pineapple; extremely effective for curing flu and hangovers alike!",

The Coffee blend was good but not quite to my taste. Flat white was not really a flat white, more a latte with less milk, but the cappuccino was very drinkable. However the coffee was hot, well priced and hit the spot so I shouldn't complain!   I also got a slice of cheese cake which was good but not amazing - it was a bit chewy which was a little odd however not unpleasant!   Anyway a good place to spend a few hours chilling out or hanging out with friends and I will definitely be going back to try the food which looked great.",

It tends to fill up each day by 1:30 so always good to stay just ahead of that rush.   For some reason, they overcrowd their menu with greasy-spoon Brit dishes but as long as you stick to the Greek options you can forgive them. The mezze platter is fantastic, and pork or chicken kabab is just the right amount for lunch. They do excellent Turkish coffee to finish. I feel strangely stimulated to keep going back. Hmmm?",

On the few days that weather is nice here in the grim North the windows are thrown open and you can sit in the window on cushions and feel like you are sitting outside. When it's cold (which is more likely) they have cosy sofas to snuggle on with a bowl of soup or cup of coffee.   Other than staple breakfast and lunch items (paninis, soup, full English/Scottish breakfasts) they also do some really tasty mezze platters that are great for sharing.",

    "text": "The Glenhas has a special place in my heart as it was where an award wining comedian bought me a hot chocolate for my birthday at 2am.   Ideal for late night cakes and coffees during the festival; the Glenhas Bistro is much more of a continental cafe than a bistro. Sandwiches and the like are quite expensive for what they are but a lovely place to sit in the big windows and watch Edinburgh burble along with a big cup of tea warming your hands.",
