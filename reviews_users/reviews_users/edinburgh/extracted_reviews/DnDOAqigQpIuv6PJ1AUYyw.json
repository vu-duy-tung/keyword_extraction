I ordered for delivery and I am happy to say the food was hot and tasty. It is great that they have a wide delivery range and even though I live pretty far from their restaurant I still had my food 20 minutes before the estimated delivery time, in under an hour!  The range of food here is huge, so you really have to look over their menu well. I found everything to have quality ingredients, perfect amount of spice and tang, and nothing greasy or oily. Happy to say that when you order something 'hot' it is truly hot! No wimpy heat here. The yassa and fried plantains are a dream and perfect with the jollof rice. Also a huge fan of the corn fritters, which are like perfect balls of cornbread, and the amazing banana bread. We just found our new go-to delivery place!",
