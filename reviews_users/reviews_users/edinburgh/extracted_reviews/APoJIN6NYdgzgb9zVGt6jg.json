    "text": "I'm a fan for sure!  I popped in here for a takeaway lynx before a hair cut, and it was mmm mmm tasty delicious!  I opted for a Mexican chicken wrap. Deliciously full of zesty light fresh tomato salsa, deep dreamy guacamole, and juicy chicken pieces. Turned out to be one of the finest I've had in a long time!   I followed it up with some kinda of Czech sponge and caramel cake, not too dry, not too sweet, lovely with a coffee probably (I had diet coke, for shame I know)  I didn't stick around a long time to fully appreciate the cafe itself but it's spacious but kinda homely with big wooden furniture and little nicknaks around the place. And a big robot by the front door. As you do!  I found myself thinking it was a little, 6.90 for a smallish wrap, smallish cake, bottle of juice. But actually it was damn tasty, so actually pretty good value I think.   Consider this a recommendation!",

    "text": "Embo is a nice and cute Deli on Top of Leith Walk. I've been there several times, mainly because its customer service is good and is a practical pit-stop between Leith & Edinburgh Centre. On my first occasion I got a chorizo salad with grilled halloumi, roast vegetables, sweet chilli (overly sweet to tell the truth) but it was a very abundant portion, washed down with a Coke.  On my other visit I went through a Meaty Breakfast Wrap with bacon, mushroom, cheddar cheese and bruschetta salad, and again too sweet for my palate. It looks that they add sugar everywhere and that is a turn-off for me.  Also, needs to be said, that the cappuccino they serve is a very sui-generis one, it looks and tastes more like a white coffee with some froth but had no direct relation with its original Italian counterpart. As they have Wi-Fi and staff is cool, I don't mind to pop there again, however it won't be my first choice.",

    "text": "Embo didn't float my boat. It has a lot of competition from nearby places, particularly on Broughton Street, that offer higher quality for less money, so it isn't on my list of places for a repeat visit.  Overall, we said: \"Embo didn't quite hit the mark, for me. I like their ideas, but the balance of the dishes isn't quite there, and I don't think that the quality on offer justifies the significantly higher price-tag than some of the similar offerings from their near neighbours. It strikes me more as a place to sit-in for a relaxing hour (the side salad that comes with their wraps when you sit-in looked quite impressive), rather than grab a quick take-out.\"",

    "text": "Embo is my standard lunch option when I am uninspired by anywhere else... it is a short walk from my flat, and on a sunny day the few tables outside are in a great wee sun trap where you can watch the often colourful characters of Leith walk wander by!   The owner goes out of his way to please, and never without a smile.  I am always interested to see what local artist is showing their work in the cafe, and if they took card payment I may have spent a small fortune by now... :-)  I highly recommend the halloumi & chorizo salad ... *drools*.  So, give it a go and tell him you read about wee Embo on the inter-web... he'll be well-impressed! :-D  Enjoy!  #IndependentEdinburgh",

    "text": "Note to anyone who is reading this and thinking I have never heard/seen this place before........ check. it. out! I ended up here after a wee stroll round town this Saturday afternoon, now this place does have only a few seats so I wasn't expecting to get one, but I got a lovely stool by the window to watch the world go by.  Main reason I am rating this place, the salads........ YUMMERS. I had a hot smoked trout, crayfish, creme fraiche and salsa salad, man alive was it heaven for my belly! Plus they are not stingy with the fish, which I was half expecting as it was only a fiver which seemed very reasonable. Another reason..... everywhere these days seems to do paninis, not that I have anything against that whatsoever, but it was nice to see something different. Instead of your usual toasted panini, they do toasted wraps, with a selection that sound devine! And I would imagine you can mix it up a little and choose your own.   Service was good, friendly and efficient. Nice, interesting interior, free newspapers and they have a specials board, always a bonus. I already have my eye on a toasted wrap with parma ham, mozzarella and pesto for next time!",

I'm addicted to the Mocha with hazelnut syrup and am trying to wean myself of them these days with just plain coffees but I'm still drawn in by the smell of those freshly made wraps and knowing how tasty they are it's hard to resist. Damn you Mike and your friendly atmosphere, fresh and tasty food and addictive coffee's.",

Offering a sit in option in fresh modern surroundings or take away if you're in a bit of a rush, Embo is a great place to grab breakfast, lunch or just a quick snack.  The menu is devilishly good making it hard to make a decision of what to go for. They have an excellent selection of sandwiches and wraps with so many fresh, delicious fillings to choose from. In addition to this they also offer soups, antipasti and an excellent vegetarian range including my favourite Baba Ganoush.    The prices are reasonable and the staff have always been friendly on my visits whether I've been sitting in or taking away. An excellent choice if you're looking for a bite to eat in the area. Thumbs up!",

This cafe sells a selection of wraps, sandwiches, paninis and light lunches to eat in and take-away. It isn't the cheapest place to eat but it does offer good quality and special offers like the 'Juice of the Day' which I had when I was there, a lovely mango and papaya infusion.  I loved the attitude of the staff in here, I never once saw anyone rush making a half arsed sandwich, they always took their time to make the best baguette or panini they could regardless of the queue, which makes me think that they are dedicated to their job in here.",

As soon as you enter you are greeted by an incredibly friendly man who is extremely cheerful and clearly loves what he does, which to my mind is exactly what you want from a cafe and makes a nice change from the grunts you get in chain cafes around the land.  The food is pretty good too - I only went for breakfast but we were pleased with our breakfast wraps and toast - all good quality stuff. Plus there was a huge chocolate cake on the counter, which very nearly caused us to go back later in the day. Maybe next time.",

    "text": "A bit down Leith Walk from the Omni Centre hides a darling little cafe that I've only recently become acquainted with. Embo offers very, very fresh and lighter foods, including sandwiches, generous salads, and delicious wraps with not-so-usual ingredients. I am a big fan of their grilled wraps (especially the Mexi-wrap) and their ever-changing homemade soups (no, really homemade, in the storenot homemade by a distributor, as many 'homemade' soups actually are). They also offer handmade sweets, including a dreamy carrot cake (yes, with little chunky bits and, gasp!, really-real cream cheese icing! Ah, bliss!!)   The only negative comment I have is that it's durn near impossible to get served quickly during the weekday lunch rushI wonder whether at noon someone rings a bell and business suits creep out of the woodwork like so many ants and form a lengthy queue. Hmmthey may be on to something",
