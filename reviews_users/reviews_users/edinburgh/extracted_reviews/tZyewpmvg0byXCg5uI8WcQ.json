I've eaten their twice and never been disappointed. The bar area is more relaxed and serves all the usual beers on tap and other drinks. It also does a bar food menu which my friends and i use often. The staff are friendly and the young owner is often working there and always comes over to see how we are getting on. It's not the cheapest drinks/food but definitely one of the better bars in the New Town of Edinburgh. The Scottish theme helps make it stand out - particularly if you are just visiting Scotland.",

First, the pics don't do their food justice--and the pics do look very good. EVERYTHING we had was DELICIOUS. We started with an appetizer of Haggis, nips & tatties--YAY! I am forever sold on that dish and so was my wife.  We then moved to a steak--I forget which one it was but it was delicious.  We moved on to some form of cheesecake. I think it was the only cheesecake they had so not too much trouble to figure out if you're there. DELICIOUS. In fact, it's been over a year and my wife was just commenting on how good it was a couple of days ago.  By the way, the pricing was very reasonable.  There are a lot of great places to eat in Edinburgh and a lot of great things to see but if I went back there tomorrow, my first stop would be to The Magnum for some Haggis, nips & tatties. Then off to High Street!",

It was the perfect bowl of soup after a long, cold day of walking. I had the chicken breast on a bed of pea risotto and it was very good too. The waitress was lovely and it's very cozy in the dining area.",

Once again is did not disappoint. One thing that is worth noting about this place is that it is worth making reservations. It was full both nights that I went.

The salmon cake starter was perfectly cooked and came with a tangy chili sauce. My husband had the venison and was delighted. You know a chef knows what he's doing when he cooks venison so that it is tender and juicy - bad venison is really BAD. The red cabbage and blood pudding were perfect accompaniments.  I had a good ol ribeye and was not disappointed. The meat was tender, cooked perfectly medium rare and the sides included lovely roasted potatoes and tomatoes. The meat and veg were both incredibly fresh and full of flavor.  Reservations recommended - the restaurant is not large and the bar can definitely get packed on the weekend. But the staff is unbelievably helpful and gracious and friendly. Wish we lived closer!",

    "text": "I so wish I'd come here when I still live in the neighborhood.  If I'd known then what I know now, I would have quickly become a regular.    After a fantastic meal down the road at Locanda de Gusti, The Man and I stopped in here for a drink.  It is a warm and inviting pub, but is not what I would call an \"Old Man\" pub.  They had some unusual beers on tap, but I was mostly drawn in by the friendliness of the staff and not-crowded conditions which are hard to find on a Saturday night.  The only down side is the atmosphere.  By the end of our second drink not only was the bar not-crowded, it was nearly empty.  Maybe it does most of its trade earlier in the evening but I would have loved to have stayed here longer if I hadn't been looking for a bit more of an upbeat vibe.",

    "text": "The Magnum isn't on the main strip of bars and restaurants, so you have to know about it, and a lot of faithful and local regulars do. It's been here since 1981, so it's a bar of the 80s, which automatically makes it cool of course. It was the fairy lights around the big arched windows that lured me in, as twinkling fairy lights always do, and there's definitely a bit of something romantic going on here, so if you staring into each other's eyes and being lovestruck is your thing, then this is a good place to do it.  Aside from loved up dining and drinking, The Magnum is also really nice for a just a drink and a banter with friends. The bar has a really friendly feel to it, classy but laidback, and you do feel a bit like you're part of a cool, New Town gang of some kind (they accept me for who I am, etc, sob). They have a really tasty, pretty classic Scottish food menu, and a separate restaurant area for food eating activities. Very decent.",

    "text": "I didn't expect too much on first sight of The Magnum bar, but this place is quickly becoming one of my favourite places in Edinburgh.  The atmosphere in here is hard to top. It's relaxed and friendly, never once have I felt like a stranger to the place and I always feel as though the staff go the extra mile to keep you happy. The dining area and the bar are both lovely, playing mainly swing music when I was there both times, and that made such a difference to the feel of the place.  The seabass dish with black olives and chorizo was absolutely amazing, so good I had it the next time I visited too! It isn't overly expensive, and I could easily spend an afternoon in there with a nice bottle of wine.  One of the best places for food and drink in the New Town, by far.",
