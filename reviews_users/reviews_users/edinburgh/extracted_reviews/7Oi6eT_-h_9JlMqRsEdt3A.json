The food is pretty good and not really that much more expensive than anywhere else.  Ignoring the silly titles, the Hot Dogs and Burgers are great. Portions are a decent size and it tastes like it was cooked that day, which is always a bonus.  Staff look a little tired, but what waiter doesn't.",

The food is great, especially at dinner time when the portions seem to be bigger. The menu is huge, with everything you associate with American diners, from pizzas to burgers, BBq ribs, fajitas, chilli, garlic bread, banoffee pie, cheesecake... And then there are the cocktails, served by the glass or pitcher if a few of you fancy the same thing, and look out for the happy hour deals. The service is efficient and friendly and the decor is all about cars, from traffic lights to petrol station junk, sorry, memorabilia- cheesy but it works. It is a bit pricier than your usual pub food, you pay about 8-9 quid for a main meal, but the dishes are big enough for any appetite and you would be hard pushed to fit a starter, mains and dessert so choose well, share and eat until you pop.",

It's your run of the mill Pub, they had a good selection of beers and ciders and we ordered two appetizer platters.  A little Applebee's-esque. But the Peterbilt grill on the wall reminded me of my Grandfather, rest his soul.  We were able to snag a table, kick back, relax, enjoy our beers/ciders and ate some potato skins, some nachos, a few southwest taquitos, and an assortment of other fried goods - all very healthy, obviously.  Located far enough away from the castle to weed out the majority of tourists, yet close enough for window shopping and browsing en route on foot.  Near the cab lines for easy exit.  A decent place to stop in and take a load off.",

    "text": "i'm a fan of chain restaurants.  they're reliable and generally consistent with the food and service that you get.  so when a group of 6 of us were looking for a place to eat dinner near the royal mile on one of the last nights of the fringe festival, we decided to head here.  on arrival we were told it would be a 50 minute wait but since that was likely to be the wait anywhere we added our name to the list and sat down at the bar.  the bar was packed, obviously with everyone else that was waiting for a table but we managed to grab a tiny booth so at least the ladies could rest their feet with a seat.  the boys finally managed to get to the bar and returned with drinks which luckily took up most of the waiting time as we were soon shown to a table.  now this table may have be able to seat 6 children, but 6 full sized adults was a bit of a squeeze!  we didn't complain though as we couldn't really afford to wait for a table much longer in case we missed our show.  the menu is fairly standard american type food.  loads of burgers, wraps, pizzas, pastas, and some other american classics.  most of us went for the burgers and one person had the kentucy wings and chips.  i have to say for a really busy restaurant, we got our food fairly quickly.  the burgers were all of a good size and i have to say mine was quite tasty.  but compared to some other burgers i've had recently (burger meats bun!!! omg!!) this one lacked a bit in comparision.  having not had a proper lunch and breakfast being long gone i also forced the boyfriend to share a side of mac and cheese with me.  this was ok, but a bit bland after all the bacon on top was gone.  so if you're looking for a place to go for a good food on the royal mile, then the filling station is definitely a-ok but that's as far as i would go.  i enjoyed my meal, but i think that was mainly due to the company and not for the fact that the food was outstanding.",

We ended up here after asking the concierge at our hotel (a really nice hotel!) where to go.  In fairness, we asked for a good/local meal, but didn't specify that it shouldn't be touristy.  The decorations, the service, and the ambience were nothing to write home about.  The location was fine (on the Royal Mile).  The appetizer (bruschetta) was  actually quite good.  BUT the meal, itself, was a big letdown.  The sides were plain bad--a miniature serving of coleslaw drenched in mayonnaise, and fries that had clearly been reheated from a freezer bag.  Eat somewhere else.  It doesn't matter that this place's prices are reasonable, since the food isn't worth it.",

I'm not saying it is a bad thing but rather that it's just ok.   We came here twice during our week in Edinburgh and they were both good experiences. The service was very good and I did enjoy the automobile decor they had plastered all of the place. They had Guinness and Kopparberg and that is all I needed for drinks so that was good too.  So the food was pretty standard fare but I did get to try their haggis appetizer and it was good. The burgers were nice and meaty and the calzone was big and tasty too. They weren't mind blowing but solid as far as quality goes. Their dessert choices however were subpar but luckily we weren't lacking for sweets during our lunch visits.",

When you're aspiring to a type of cuisine that isn't worth the flattery of imitation, it's quite the uphill battle. What the place does offer is decent prices, large quantities, way too many options, and cheerful service. Well done capturing the essence of casual American dining!!   If you are American and on vacation, don't come here. That's like going to McDonald's in Paris instead of getting a baguette sandwich. Well, I guess that's not a fair comparison since Scotland hasn't any offerings even a fraction as tempting, but you know what I mean. Try to experience local fare, no matter how dismal it may be, for the sake of culture and adventure! You're better off getting fish and chips or a meat pie in a local pub.   If you do get stuck here, though, do NOT get a hamburger. I made that mistake because I saw one on nearby table that looked pretty good and I thought the local Angus beef would somehow elevate it from a typical American meal. Unfortunately, what I got wasn't tasty at all, but had an unpleasant flavor and dry texture. My boyfriend's steak and ale pie was much more appetizing, I'd recommend that.  The saving grace of this establishment, besides our extremely friendly and competent waiter, was that they offered an appetizer of deep fried haggis balls. This means you can try one of the scariest dishes of all time in a form that's easy to get down, especially if you share the order with a group.  A few bites of the deep-fried spiced organ meat and you can proudly respond, when inevitably you are asked, \"Yes, I had haggis in Scotland. No big deal!\"",

They are rather large portions and the price is quite reasonable.  The cocktails are fantastic, and you can get jugs of it also. The drink is quite expensive though, and i didn't think the service was upto much the last time we were there.  you sometimes have to wait on a table, but you can sit at the front and have a drink until your talbe is ready. They do all different kinds of food. The decor in the place is great,and they have all different kinds of things on the wall. It is a rather lively pub/restaurant.",

If you're an American desperate for a taste of home after nights of haggis and deep fried anything, it's here you'll want to come for a burger or some fajitas and a touch of fifties diner style.   The walls are decorated with American memorabilia, including license plates from various states in the US. The tables are arranged well, and there are booths if that's what you prefer.   There's an impressive menu of cocktails to get you in a party mood, and the starters are lovely and huge. If you're a party of two, a single starter can easily be split between you - if you can agree on what to get!   Their burgers are good quality, and taste like real American burgers which have been made with proper beef mince and not much else, unlike many burgers you get in the UK which have fillings and additives.",

    "text": "Very good, comfy high street American restaurant that isn't a rip-off!  \"High Street\" in Edingburgh is a touristy area indeed, as it stretches from Edinburgh Castle to Holyrood Palace, with plenty of small restaurants in between. The Filling Station, if your mind is set upon American style food, is a formidable lunch and dinner option. Good food, very nice decor, super-friendly staff, fairly competitive prices (for Edinburgh anyway!).   Went there twice (once for dinner, once for drinks) in July of 2014. Even if you don't have a reservation and times are busy, the very helpful staff will eventually find a table for you! Bar staff are equally friendly. This is definitely a superior branch of The Filling Station chain. Dinner included fried chicken strips (not bad, but nothing special) and Chicago Deep-Filled Pizza, essentially a meat-filled quiche - which was superb and filling, There is a 20 minute waiting period for the latter, but it's worth it.  The selection of ales and lagers, including a couple of real ales, is very inviting for a late night drink, too (My hotel was close by). Prices aren't outrageous for drinks either.  Highly recommended for tourists who do not want to get ripped off.",

Looking at the posted menu on the door, it seemed like this place would do the trick.  We walk in and it's an American themed restaurant! Leave it to us to travel halfway around the world to eat at a place just like home. Even the menu called them \"fries\" instead of \"chips\"!  I had a bacon cheeseburger, and the bacon is quite a bit different in Scotland than back home. Instead of thin crunchy strips you get a bigger piece of fried pork. It's more like a slice of lunchmeat than american bacon. Still good though. The burger was very good. The waitstaff was attentive (and one of the guys in our group even tried to get her phone number - sheesh. College kids!!)  I'm knocking off a star for the bathrooms though. Truly disappointing. Everything was wet as if there was a leak in a pipe or faucet. The stalls were dirty and broken. There were no paper towels or ways to dry your hands. Just awful facilities downstairs.  As an American reviewing an American themed eatery abroad though, they did a pretty good job getting it right. The decor and music were spot on for the 50's. The classic comfort foods and american fare were all there. It's pretty legit. Like going to an Applebee's here in the states.",

Ordered a couple of Stellas and a bruschetta, asked for the bill after ordering my second Stella. Reminded once, but bill never came. Put the card out on the table as a reminder. Nothing. So I picked it up and decided to pay at the front. My elusive waiter comes running and loudly screams \"You have to pay at the table!\". So I say get my bill which I have been asking for 30 min. Of course, the machine comes out like magic. As I am leaving, the same waiter screams, the exit is to your right. I took a step to the left by mistake to get out. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all costs, but it is in prime location, so of course they believe they can get away with treating paying customers like s**t! Will never visit again and make sure my little circle knows to avoid this place !",

I ordered the hash browns, which could have been McDonald's hash browns if I didn't know better, and then the omelet  I ordered was completely flavorless. Really disappointing. It's the first time I've ever had to use hot sauce just to get some flavor.  It's fairly obvious that it's not a Scottish pub from the outside, so hopefully not a lot of people make the mistake of coming here thinking that's what it is only to find an American style restaurant.

We all had the dinner special - appetizer & meal thing.  They were ok. Now first of all, please don't advertise you are the \"great American Highway\" as you are not Route 66. And don't paint all your memorabilia red; this is considered a \"hot\" color and if you want people to hang around and drink, you don't paint & decorate in red, orange or yellow. AND, yes, we know the waitress was trying to be helpful, but you are a service industry. When a patron (that would be the person paying the bill) says they want an item, don't try to talk them into trying something else. The customer is always right; you are there to serve. If they ask, then answer, but don't try to influence over and over; it's very annoying.",

Situated in the centre of the High Street on the Royal Mile, The Filling Station is always very popular with the tourists.   I love to go here for food because it always reminds me of America with the American style decor and its huge portions. Inside the restaurant it is very 'Americanised' with car registration plates, maps and the seats arranged in booth styles to be like a diner. The menu is very American/Texan orientated with dishes including burgers, nachos, steaks, and of course, chips! I adore their burgers, which are absolutely massive, and if I eat one for lunch it will always fill me up for the whole day. The prices are really reasonable too with most main meals priced at about five pounds.   Also, I think special mention ought to be paid to The Filling Station's milkshakes, particularly their strawberry, which is absolutely gorgeous!   There is a bar inside which overlooks the busy Royal Mile so it can lovely to go here for a drink in the afternoon and watch all the tourists. Every time I have been to The Filling Station is has always been really packed, especially on a weekend, which is a good sign, but not so great if you want to eat here and can't get a seat!   The Filling Station has plenty of tables and chairs outside the restaurant on the High Street so it is a great place to sit on a warm day and watch all the action on the Royal Mile.",

I popped in here last summer with a few friends when we were exploring the street performers of The Fringe along the Royal Mile. It was really busy but we thankfully were able to get a seat. We shared some potato skins and nachos and got some cocktails too. The cocktails were tasty, the food was pretty good and it's a fairly inoffensive place to sit and have some snacks.  Despite the fact that it was busy, the service was fast and the staff were very friendly so I think the Filling Station deserves four stars.",

We didn't realize that it was American diner themed until we'd been seated, but we weren't exactly at liberty to be picky, seeing as this was the 7th place we tried and the only one who would seat us.  The food was fine, nothing stellar or outstanding, but reliable and filling at good prices. The extra star comes from the service, as our server was super friendly, checked on us a couple of times, and had a happy smile the entire time.",

I've dined at the Filling Station in LA, California, so we thought it would be a solid choice. The service was friendly and there was no wait. We shared a brushetta...interesting preparation. Also shared a steak fajita. The food was just ok. I mean it satisfied our hunger but nothing really to rave about.",

They have been aware of this now for over 50 hours and have yet to clean a single piece of faeces from the back garden.   I have made them aware that the fetid pool of faeces is directly underneath my 6 year old daughter's bedroom window and that this is  universally recognised as a danger to health.    There is currently between a foot and 18 inches of their sewage lying in a stinking pool which they have no urgency to clear whatsoever.   The manager at the Filling Station has been commendable in his dealing with this issue. Quite clearly his level of integrity is not reflected by his employer though.   How on earth people who are happy to leave faeces lying around have the gall to use the word \"restaurant\" in their company name is beyond me.",

It was an American restaurant, so no surprises there.  The server we had was absolutely lovely, attentive and did her best to make us feel welcomed. The speed of service was quick, but then again, this was before the lunch rush. The portions were bigger than we thought but for the price we paid it was actually great! Seeing as how the restaurant is on the Royal Mile, it was a win.  The food is average at best, but at least very filling. We didn't mind it all that much and were glad to have found a decent place to eat. Nothing really to write home about, but good enough if you're not picky or want something familiar.",

Straight off the bat we walked in with a big group and there was no visible person to seat us or visible area to go up to to wait so we milled around and someone came up to us and eventually got us sat downstairs.  We ordered drinks with a variety of cocktails and such on offer, good variety at that.  I went with a cider as most were horribly overpriced (N.B so was the cider, like 5 quid a pint!)  We then went to order food and i thought i would play it safe with a burger with blue cheese.  This came and honestly i could not taste the cheese, majorly overdone with the chilli sauce that was an addition to the burger.  The burger itself was decent enough and the salad was ok with nice crispy chips on the side.  They forgot my order of spicy chips instead of regular fries but it took so long to order i wasn't too fussed.  On the plus side once the drinks arrived and our order was taken the food was along in double quick time!  We were considering shots but our waitress didnt know what they had and constantly had to check with the bar staff about what she could and could not offer us so we jsut left it and went for the bill.  It was they that we got the little surprise of the bottle of wine.  It cost 13.50 for a bottle of middling wine that one of us ordered.  Thats quite expensive for the wine that we got as you could buy it down the road for a fiver.  This coupled with the other problems unfortunately drags this down to a two star.",
