It's always difficult to say goodbye, especially to people you bond very closely within the course of a week, but the Caley did a great job of supporting and celebrating with us. They brought out a ton of appetizers, from haggis bonbons, bread, hummus, olives... literally something for everyone. We had pre-ordered our entree and dessert but I only managed a few bites of my burger as I had been so filled with the appetizers. Plus, I had also been hamming it up with some coos earlier in the day and who really has a heart to chow down on some beef after that? I can say this, the bun was really stellar. I had previously ordered the raspberry cheesecake. It wasn't bad but I live in a place surrounded by world-class cheesecakes so there wasn't any competition coming from it.  We also celebrated one of our group's birthdays and the restaurant was happy to keep the drinks flowing for the birthday girl. Kate, one of our servers/bartenders was MVP.",

Our food was very nice with just the presentation of the mulled pear being a bit let down by the marscapone breaking up in the wine and brioche is not quite firm enough when toasted to make you fully confident about spreading parfait on it. The spicy Crombie's sausages they're currently serving are fantastic though.  Service wasn't anymore than average. Possibly down to it being the weekend but we got sprayed twice, each time the table next to us was wiped down and they could maybe do with one or two fewer tables so as not to require staff and customers to need to shimmy carefully past them. A few apostrophes on their main chalkboard wouldn't go amiss either and I can only assume that having \"terrible\" as the tasting note for Deuchars (a Caledonian product) is ironic, albeit you could apply it to the price of a pint.",

It was pretty empty inside and the staff did take a while to notice us, but when they did they were very friendly and helpful, can't fault the staff.  I ordered the chicken, mushroom and bacon pie, Joe ordered the lamb flank special and a side of breads and oils. The bread was very stale. I wasn't a fan of the lamb but it isn't my type of dish anyway. My pie was a little odd. It was basically a very stodgy shortcrust bowl with the filling, which was tasty, and a little puff pastry lid that looked shop bought and was cold and dry. The green beans with it were delicious and the new potatoes were OK, if a little under cooked.  Overall, nice place for a drink and I might eat there again but maybe just for brunch.",

    "text": "I love whisky and I love beer. So, the fact that I've only recently got around to visiting the legendary Caley Sample Room is as baffling as it is shameful.  And it really is my kind of bar, in the sense that I like to feel slightly out of my depth. The big chalk boards behind the bar are in a constant state of flux, as barrels are changed and added in a parade of baffling beer names and descriptions. A few of the guest breweries I recognised as being from the current crop of UK craft darlings (the Bristol Beer Factory was well represented on my first visit) but the more exotic brands were entirely new to me.  As I stood there like a slack-jawed idiot, while the patient barman tried his best to take my order, I reflected on the fact that not too many years ago, Stella was considered quite cosmopolitan. Even growing up a few streets down from the CAMRA headquarters, the choice facing your ever-hopeful 16 year old pub-goer was really limited to weak British beer (which always seemed to taste of farts) or strong continental lager.  'Beer' now really is a completely different category, covering a staggering range of varieties, strengths, styles and countries of origin. I started off with a fairly light IPA from Buxton (a special limited run, just for April) before moving on to a rich and chocolatey smoked porter, both of which were brilliantly distinctive.  These were relatively cheap options, but it's possible to spend upward of 20 on a pint. What's the difference? Is it worth the extra? I have no idea, but the bar staff certainly seemed to. I was there for a couple of hours and at least two-thirds of the drinks I saw ordered involved a lengthy conversation between staff and punter. There seemed to be plenty of regulars, but I doubt the words \"pint of the usual\" get said very often - this is drinking as adventure.  And it's definitely a global adventure in the Caley Sample Room. Shelves of bottled beers from all over the world compete for your attention, their label and box art as lurid and weird as their names. Only a fool or a hero would try and conquer this lot.  So, mine's a pint of the unusual please.",

Part Pub, Part Bistro, Part 'Designer Barn' it veers towards trying to be 'all things to all...people'.  What cannot be denied though is that it is a wonderful space with a crackling atmosphere when the numbers inside it rack up.  The Staff are attentive, knowledgable and friendly in a way that doesn't have you worrying about having a 'friend request' waiting for you on Facebook when you get home.  With more awards plastered around the place than Daniel Day Lewis's mantle piece, my expectations of the 'grub' were up around Saturn somewhere.  I have eaten there twice, lunch first time round when I was massively underwhelmed by a steak pie with a concrete top masquerading as pastry.  However always willing to 'give a sucker an even break', I did return with a friend for dinner and both my Salmon and her homemade Burger with REAL chips were simple Bistro Fayre of the highest quality.   So maybe I just got unlucky on the first occasion or maybe some more consistency in the kitchen is required?  I will endeavour to find out.  Not short on 'wow factor' as you enter and a great hangout in the 'burbs' for those in the know.",

The interior is nice and clean, not hip in anyway, but definitely not a pub, gastropub yes. The menu is small and I would class it as a tad above average prices.  The menu has a mix of what you would expect at a pub, just slightly varied to more 'foodie' I think, i.e. the tempura battered fish and chips I ordered. We ordered some beers on tap, all of which were nice, served slightly warm and each was tasty. It seemed busy, but the food arrived quickly, and was nicely presented. The fish was really well fried/prepared and the chips are good, the mushy peas received mix reviews because lots of whole grained mustard had been mixed in to them. I love peas, so no need to add to them, especially since the mustard didn't really fit.  My partner got the burger, and it was really well cooked, still pink, which he appreciated, and it had a chutney on it which was nice. My friend also got the fish and enjoyed it. We were pretty full, but opted to try the sticky toffee pudding as it is something a visiting friend should try, it arrived, and was absolutely massive! And absolutely delicious, served with ice cream and lots of sauce, it was very tasty and a nice finish to the meal. I was pleasantly surprised by this place, and might not go often, but would definitely recommend it.",

In terms of the decor, the pub is great and really cosy and has the appearance of a big barn with wood pretty much everywhere you look. I ordered sausage and mash and only a coke as I was recovering from a hangover and the sausage and mash was priced at 9, which I would never have paid if I were to come here on my own, but thankfully I wasn't paying.

The food wins awards, the beers and drinks are varied and plentiful and it has the best table water in Edinburgh (stuffed with mint, cucumber and whatever else they think will help).  The architecture's a little odd, but that probably stems from its previous life as part of the nearby brewery. The exterior can seem a little uninviting and unfortunately it lends itself to smokers clogging up the doorway, but the pub opens up once you're in. The restaurant to the right has plenty of covers, set around heavy wooden tables that bring a feeling of tradition and quality. To your right is the rest of the pub, with a long bar that stretches into the distance. Good for a quiet midweek pint, or a busy Friday night, they host regular live music nights and other special events.  The staff know they're stuff about the menu and the drinks on offer, which is all you can ask. Fortunately I've always found them friendly too.  It's well worth your while calling in to the CSR if you're in the area - near Fountainbridge, the canal, Gorgie Farm and the other delights of this side of town.",
