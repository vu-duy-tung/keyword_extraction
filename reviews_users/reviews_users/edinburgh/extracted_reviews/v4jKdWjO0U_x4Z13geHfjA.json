    "text": "This is such a nice little restaurant and I particularly love it because it's a social enterprise run by a community of Sikh Women who know what they're doing. They apparently train more people in the kitchen to create more employment opportunities.   I tried the Aloo Paratha and it was delicious! I've also been recommended the Thali by a friend, but I haven't gotten around to eating it. If you're wondering what to drink here, you wouldn't go wrong with a Lassi or a Masala Chai.   Solid 5 stars.",

    "text": "I'd walked past Punjabi Junction many times when wandering down Leith and been meaning to try it. It's commendable for being a social enterprise helping provide skills and opportunities for women.   It's a nice little venue, bright and with a relaxed cafe/diner feel. It feels like stepping into someones kitchen and being served some wonderful home-cooked food. I had a chicken curry wrap and my friend went for the fish curry.   Both were great;  cheap, authentic, satisfying comfort food. It was a nice size for lunch and so we had enough room for dessert. I'd *definitely* have the gulab jamun with mango ice cream again.   Service was maybe a little bit too relaxed and so wouldn't have been great if we were in a rush but given the homely feel I didn't mind too much. I will happily come back to try some more of their offerings.",

    "text": "This all-female powerhouse of a social enterprise is a wonder in Leith, offering up delicious, authentic Indian food.   The paratha with accompanying sauce for dipping, the saag aloo with the fluffiest of rice; all of it fragrant and full of flavour; a real Indian feast. But the show-stealer was the absolutely GIANT vegetable pakora. I dare your eyes not to widen as they're placed on the table before you. And they taste every bit as good as they look.  Service was friendly and fast. Refreshingly, everything on the menu and the order process was made clear to us from the start, leaving no room for confusion. Only the watery, weak mango lassi has me leaning to four stars. Other than that, Punjabi Junction is an Indian delight to be found in Leith.",

    "text": "Near the foot of Leith Walk, this is a fantastic cafe serving great (and cheap) Punjabi food.  Open for breakfast and lunch, the dishes on the menu consist of simply, homely food such as dal and chapatis or chicken curry and rice, but here simple really equals delicious as the women who work here are all amazing cooks.  The decor is very plain, with white walls and paper tablecloths, but somehow it works, and the cafe feels very light and airy.  Set up as a social enterprise by a Sikh women's collective, it's comforting to know that, by enjoying tasty curry, you are also supporting a very worthwhile community initiative.  This place has a refreshingly different (and dare I say it, more authentic) atmosphere from a typical Indian, and is definitely somewhere you should check out.",

Coupled with the fact that this is a tremendous community venture providing a focal point for some excellent endeavours, I can't recommend it highly enough.  Overall, we said: \"Open from Wednesday to Saturday, the Punjabi Women's Kitchen is understated, bright, full of welcoming aromas. It's one of those places you want to make sure everyone knows about, yet still retains its winning charm, and always has a free table with your name on it.\"",
