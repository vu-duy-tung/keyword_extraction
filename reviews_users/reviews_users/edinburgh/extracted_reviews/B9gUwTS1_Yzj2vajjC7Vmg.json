Love it!",

    "text": "Fashionable George Street is the perfect location for this high quality, attractive Italian restaurant. Centotre's delicious fresh food and high standard of customer service have made it a popular choice since it opened.   The menu is admittedly not the most original but still offers a wide variety of choice to please even the pickiest of eaters. All the main classics are present - pizza, pasta, fish and steak, along with an impressive array of breads and the finest imported cheeses. The dessert menu boasts some excellent choices and my personal favourite, the Centotre meringue, never fails to disappoint.  Cocktail lovers are also spoilt for choice with a long list of exotic sounding drinks.   The fresh ingredients used are evident in the taste of the food, and while many Italian restaurants sometimes serve bland-tasting dishes, Centotre takes care over the taste and preperation of it's meals. There was a slight gap between courses, but the bustling atmosphere more than made up for it.   The decor is sophisticated and tasteful, with the pink theme adding an unusual slant. Friendly and efficient staff complete the Centotre experience. The menu tends to be quite pricey, making Centotre a perfect place to go for a treat, or better still, if someone is paying for your meal! Highly recommended.",

The atmosphere is great on a Friday night, if you're into the fast pace buzz. I've always stayed safe and gone for pasta and pizza options which are always so fresh and hit the spot.. Don't recommend for a romantic setting on a friday night but it is a good spot for a catch up with friends even for drinks!

It is a nice big, bright, airy place with friendly staff. The food there is Italian and is of a decent standard and reasonable prices (not cheap though!). If you are looking for a quiet romantic Italian place, Centotre is not for you because it is too open plan, but its a great place to go for maybe a bite to eat on a Sunday. Good place!",

My only criticism relates to the price (about 10), however the beautiful interior, bustling atmosphere and central location are worth paying extra. Finally, best cappucino in Edinburgh  well recommended.",

I was taken out for dinner here, and although the food was nice, 'nice' is about as excited as you could get about it, especially given the prices. I had a linguine dish, covered in what was essentially nothing more than tomatoes, garlic and chicken, but it still cost almost 11. Similarly, my dad's spaghetti with mussels in a white wine, cream and parsley sauce was nice but not exactly hugely original.   Call me old fashioned, but to me an italian restaurant should have some degree of character or rustic charm to it. If not, it should be really good value, or at least something so tasty that it stands out from all its rivals. When it has none of these things, you can't help think that it's kind of a disappointment - no matter how trendy or 'George Street' it may be.  They have a blackboard outside announcing to the world that they do the best cupcakes and cocktails in the world. Whether or not that's True I don't know, what I do know is that their pizzas/pastas certainly aren't the best. Don't get me wrong, they're good, they're just nothing more than that.",

Nice atmosphere and stunning building - look at the ceiling to see all the corniced delights and details. It's a very pretty place indeed.   Best kept secret of the entire place? The most incredible hot chocolates. They have the consistency of melted dark chocolate - when you dip your spoon in the chocolate coats it from top to bottom. How many hot chocs from Starbucks do that?! Legendary.   I dunno why I'm leaving off the final star... It's a really good place. I wonder if it's because I haven't had a full meal here?",

Centotre (which is Italian for 103) is a wonderful italian restaurant on George Street, as I've only eaten breakfast there I'm guessing its an Italian mainly due to;   a) its name b) its Italian owners  c) the fact it has learn Italian audio playing in the toilets.   The breakfast here is amazing. My fare of choice is a bacon and scrambled egg focaccia with breakfast tea. Lunch is unnecessary after eating breakfast here as I'm generally stuffed until at least dinner time. I keep meaning to try the waffles but as our server Elise will usually greet me with 'morning Kelly, the usual?' I'm easily swayed back to bacon and eggs out of sheer familiarity.   Will someone please come with me for dinner so I can try some of the proper Italian food on offer please, its so depressing that I haven't tried it yet.",

There probably are other restaurants in Edinburgh that are Italian, plus modern and fashionable, don't get me wrong, but with Centotre's towering position, housed in a former bank on George Street, it's hard to ignore.  And it shouldn't be ignored, everything about Centotre is worth soaking up, bread and pasta sauce style. I am slightly biased towards anything Italian anyway, but a meal here is always an enjoyable experience, and the spacious booths, nice high ceilings and stylish environment have a part to play in that. Of course, there's no point in sitting in a restaurant just for the scenery, the agenda is high quality Italian food, which is a mix of traditional and contemporary, and whether it's pizza, pasta, or meat dishes you require, Centotre will serve them up in very tasty form. The portions here are generous, so do note this if you're not an eater of large meals, (not a problem for me, it has to be said).",

They have great cocktails though, and the staff take their duties very seriously. They always have lots to do though - I think they try to make up in entertainment what they lack in va va voom.

The dizzyingly high ceilings, the splendid sense of opulence without ostentation, the chirpy serving staff, the hot ch... hot ch... hot... cho... sorry, I went off into a little dreamland for a moment there. What was I saying? Oh, yes, the hot chocolate! Thick, rich, dark hot chocolate to slide into your tummy on a cold winter's day... Mmmm...  It also plays host to the legendary weekly #EdCM gathering of techy types and social-savvy supergeeks from all over Edinburgh on a Friday morning, the space, light and sheer class of the place perfectly suited to the event.  And finally, there's the toilet arrangement, which is just too much fun to believe. Setting aside for a moment the super-swish decor in that downstairs defecatory dominion, let's talk about the audio situation. Or should I say, let's talk about coffee. Because down in the toilets, you can learn conversational Italian - I can now ask for a coffee with milk, thanks to Centotre's toilet tutelage. But beware. I also spent so long just sitting there saying \"con leche\" to the stall door that everyone had left by the time I got back up. How do you say \"oops\" in Italian?",

Anyway I've never been for dinner (yet) but the menu always looks tempting.  Last night a small posse of us trooped in for hot chocolate. It won't be the cheapest hot chocolate in town but it is bloody awesome. A cup full of melted chocolate with milk on the side - I went hardcore and passed on the milk. It was fantastic - pure, lush, melted chocolatey goodness and just the treat on a blowy Edinburgh night. Centotre even made us fresh cupcakes incase we wanted some sweet treats (did you think we would say no?!) and even made a GF option which looked exactly the same as the other girls cakes.  So, fab hot chocolate and after this, I really want to go back and have dinner now, with maybe a wee hot chocolate to round off the meal...",

The venue is a gorgeously high-ceilinged, greek-columned room that must have been an old banking hall or something, with a bar at its centre. The service is so attentive it's almost awkward, as they insisted on brushing up every teeny crumb on the table in between courses.  But overall it was just... fine. The menu isn't exactly imaginative and felt like it was trying to be a swanky Prezzo or ASK - though that might be what you're looking for in which case there's a good selection of pizza/pasta. Portions are also decent, esp the calamari starter which two could probably share.  I've filed it away as a good dinner back-up for fussier eaters, but it just had a bit too much of the overpriced Italian chain feel for me to get excited.",

It shouldn't have been to difficult to realize that it's Italian for 'one hundred three', the street address here. Duh. Hey - I never said I wasn't dense.  A shockingly sun-drenched Friday morning found me sitting here, surrounded by various marketers and techies, slurping on a big ol' mug of steaming Americano, and later wolfing down a bacon focaccia.  Considering our party took up one massive rectangular table, then later metastasized to another smaller table or two, the staff was considerably patient and accommodating. Not only that, since #EdCM was ostensibly a networking event, everyone traded seats frequently, yet our final bill came out perfectly - no mystery additions and no missing items.  While the most I can report regarding my food was that it was satisfying (because it was)... I'd suggest that the most noteworthy aspects of this joint are the airy high ceilings, the enormous white pillars that stretch from floor to ceiling, and the free wi-fi. I realize the latter isn't an architectural design element, but it might as well be. To me, it's no weirder asking, \"Hey, does that place have a roof?\" than, say, \"So, does that business have free interwebz?\"  And to answer your unspoken question, no... I am -not- a cyborg. I just play one on TV.*  --  * This is a patent lie. I've only played myself on TV here and there. And once on a Margaret Cho DVD. Truth.",

The menu was overflowing with many delicious options and the only niggly bit was that one was similarly named and they brought the one my sister did not want. She enjoyed it, but it should have been pointed out.  My wife enjoyed the affagato with gusto  -hi hi -  see what I did there :o)   My sister was highly impressed with the entertaining way they teach you Italian whilst being on the toilet - yes you need to go there to know what I mean , but I promise you it will be entertaining and useful!   In contrast to the attentive service when it came to paying there was not a server to be found, so that dragged the evening a little. When you are a little tired and satisfied this is a little irritating. But we settled the bill eventually and I agreed with my wife we would return for the dessert alone",

Being recognised by staff at a restaurant is something that takes effort - the staff have to pay attention, and you can't force that.  Friendliness can't be forced either.  But it also requires something else - longevity.  Indeed, I recognise now that there isn't a big staff turnover here - they like working here. That makes the experience even more special.",

The work gets done in a central island bar, from which a host of hosts roam the space to welcome and serve the mixed clientele.  As others have pointed out in their reviews this is the venue for a weekly social, the Friday morning 'Coffee Morning' phenomenon which draws a rich mix of talented creative, technical and professional types, plus hangers on like me. We are warmly welcomed, cared for, accommodated and looked after. That's before you get to the food and beverage - they're very strong on their black pudding provision and yoghurt smoothies. As the morning progresses the other tables and booths get taken up by families, business meetings and Friday shoppers taking a break from the neighbouring boutiques. It's usually around this time that I decide I really should head to work.  Can't really fault Centotre. (Except perhaps for the price of their orange juice: proceed with caution.)",

We ordered the calamari and the bufala to start, both of which were wonderfully tasty (they give an ENORMOUS portion of bufala which I, of course, ate the entirety of). For mains we had the Branzino and the Cod. Again, really large portions-which make the prices very reasonable. I personally preferred the Branzino but both are highly recommended. Also worth mentioning is that they have an extensive gluten free menu, including gluten free pastas and pizzas (from maize and rice flours if I remember correctly). Drawbacks: horrifically gaudy decor. They could do so much more with the unique high-ceilinged space they have, but that is not enough to put you off the food :)",

The owners Victor and Carina are often found in the restaurant, and if you get the opportunity to say hi, are always interested in your opinion.   The food is always prepared with love and attention, served with a smile and utterly delectable.   As I very often tend to do, I have my staple at 103, generally speaking I have breakfast there and my menu consists of:  Bacon & egg focaccia  Fresh mint tea (or sometimes Amalfi tea)  and a Bosco.   Normally, 'my' waitress, Elise will just ask me \"the usual?\" and then bring it, that's the kind of service level you get, which is frankly amazing especially given the size and popularity of 103!  103 is my breakfast treat, it used to be every Friday, but since my daughter started nursery it's more like every 3rd or 4th Friday.

That's not to say that the dishes are insubstantial, because they are often quite the opposite, with some particularly rich and heavy dishes on their menu.

Overall, we said: \"I like Centotre's shtick, the room is super-stylish, but their food still doesn't quite win me over. It's a little over-priced, but you're paying a premium for the location and the stylishness, so I don't have a problem with that. Perhaps it's just that Edinburgh is blessed with some extremely good Italian places, some of which represent my favourite places to eat in the city. Whatever the case, it's unlikely you'll be let down by what Centotre has to offer, but equally it's unlikely to set your pulse racing.\"",

We asked reception what the best Italian restaurant in Edinburgh was and she said Centotre so that's where we ended up.   Kudos to you receptionist lady, I think you may well have been right! Get herself on Yelp & get reviewing!   Centotre is a beautiful restaurant with stunning high ornate ceilings and pillars. In fact the first thing I thought when I walked in was I need to remember this place in case I'm ever looking for somewhere to get married!   We went on a Saturday night and it was jam packed and the tables were a little too close together for my liking. I felt like we were on double date with the couple beside us! The service was still very quick though despite them being very busy and the excellent cocktails and delicious food more than made up for a bit of overcrowding! We shared an antipasti platter to start and it was simply wonderful. I then had the gnocci which was in a rich, creamy, mushroom-y sauce. It was scrumptious but I didn't manage to finish it all as it was extremely filling. My Adonis had a pizza which he devoured heartily! Unfortunately we were fit to burst by then and couldn't manage dessert but we'll definitely be back one day to sample some of the sweet stuff!   I highly recommend Centotre for dinner and it looks like it would make a lovely venue for a special event too.",

Needing somewhere to stop and refuel between an afternoon of meetings, the local Costa seemed to be our best bet, (OH NO..) but then we stumbled upon here which is like a diamond in the rough.   A fairly large restaurant, very Italian and quite high end 'wine bar'y' we were just after tea/coffee and enjoyed a cup and a chat. But...but..we could not resist the amazing looking doughnuts on the counter and proceeded to wolf a couple down in record time.   Great venue, great friendly staff - very happy to go here than one of the many chains in the area.",

I started with a crab & watermelon salad, and my partner ordered the mushroom pasta. Both were good portions for starters and played beautifully!

    "text": "Usually, I try to stick with good local cuisine when I'm on holidays, so I wasn't planning on having Italian food during my Edinburgh trip!  But this place came up on my radar when my friend and I were looking for something not too rich and heavy. Also, their menu changes every month, and everything is made fresh daily.   So we ended up sharing the contadino pasta plate - it's normally made with a cream sauce, but the chef substituted it with their amazing tomato sauce. It was delicious, it's no wonder it's never been taken off their menu!  We also shared the sardine and monks beard salad, with a spritz of lemon. It was a nice change from the typical green salad, with some sharp anchovy curbed by the lemon. Apparently monks beard is rarely seen in dishes outside of Italy, and the season for monks beard is short - so bonus points for importing special ingredients from the homeland! We also had the bruschetta, which was fresh and tasty but a bit pricey at 5 for the slice of bread topped with toms.  In the end, we were full but really toted by their dessert menu. The tiramisu was alright, I thought it could taste a bit boozier. But my hot chocolate was the star!  At 4.75, I had a cup of 55% melted chocolate with fresh whipped cream (it's only an extra 25p to add on cream). On its own, I felt the chocolate needed a bit more sweetness, that's where the cream comes in.  Once I stirred in 2 big spoonfuls, it was almost perfect. The catch is that the HC is lukewarm after adding in the cream. I was tempted to ask for it to be reheated in the microwave, but I polished it off pretty quickly.   All in all, I would highly recommend centotre. There is good variety on their monthly menu, including risotto and stews, I wish we had more people there so we could share everything!",

    "text": "Do I have chocolate on my face?  Nearly 18 hours later and I can still taste that hot chocolate!  That dark, thick, creamy, rich, unctuous hot chocolate..............  I had been to 'Centrotre' (as it was known previously) for lunch and love the fresh food and stunning interiors.  So stunning that I never thought for a minute that it was the kind of place you could just pop into for a hot bevvie.    But thanks to a search on Yelp, it became very clear that this was THE place for hot chocolate in Edinburgh.    I love hot chocolate but it has to be REAL - made from melted chocolate and not from a powder and certainly not made using boing water!!!  I've be 'burned' so many times before by bad hot choc that I didn't rush to Contini's.  I waited.  Read a few more reviews.  Looked at the pictures.  Then went home and made my own.    I was in town yesterday with a friend.  We did the spa and a healthy lunch but something was missing.  CAKE and a hot bev!  I hit the 'nearby' button on Yelp and what did I see - Contini's.  When I mentioned 'best hot chocolate in Edinburgh' my friend was racing me down the street.  Unfortunately the cake selection was slim to none.  Just a cherry pound cake with a huge ribbon of butter on top - not buttercream - pretty  much just whipped butter?  With this pushed to the side, the cake underneath was moist and lemony.  Not wow, but still lovely.  And then came the 'classic' hot chocolate.   I have had some rich, high cocao hot chocs before, but never this dark!  Oh and how kind, they put a pitcher of frothy steamed milk on the side for the people who can't their chocolate this dark.  No chance I was going to dilute the dark beauty!  We sipped and stirred and dipped (the chocolate was so thick it coated the tasty little round of shortbread).  We did everything we could to make it last as long as possible.  Now I need to see if they serve this same hot choc in their other restaurants/cafes!",

I was impressed by their range of hot chocolates but just had a breakfast tea and a heavenly donut. Service was quick, warm and friendly, and it was a nice place to chill out for 20 minutes.

We decided to hold a farewell dinner on the last night of our journey and the Contini Restaurant was a wonderful place to have it.   They gave us a private room downstairs so that we did not bother anyone else (and they did not bother us, either) The food from a pre-arranged menu was served \"family style\" and it was fantastic. I am NOT a gourmand  so I can not officially comment on the quality, but everything I ate was simply excellent. The service was great and they even made special accommodations for people with food issues. The manager and staff could not have been nicer or more accommodating.  At the end of the meal, I was stuffed and could not have possibly have eaten the fantastic desserts, but I did so anyway. (and I am glad that I did)  The only slightly negative issue was a structural pole in the center of the table which made it hard to see everyone all of the time, but compared to the great service and delicious food, this was a very minor problem.",

I so love the grand interior of the restaurant with high ceilings and lots of classy space. Even the building is old  the interior like tables, chairs and the bar are of very modern design. The heating costs during winter must be extortionate.  I did not easily warm up in there.  Toilets are downstairs and very posh. Instead of music you have a chance to learn Italian words whilst in the toilet! Just repeat the words :-)  We didn't wait long for a table and the staff was very attentive.  Food and drinks kept coming.  I had ordered a mozzarella and tomato salad as a main, which might have been the wrong order for myself, as I was already very cold. The salad did not particularly wow me, but my friend had some calamari and could not get enough. The salad also had anchovies sprinkled over it, which made the salad taste rather like fish. Besides a freshly prepared organe juice, I also ordered some peppermint tea and noticed that there was not much of a refill opportunity.  I would have so loved to order an Affogato or another Hot Chocolate,  but sadly was already full.  It's a nice place for some Italian experience!",

We had the bruschetta appetizer which was full of flavour and mouth watering; with pasta pomodoro and grilled Branzino.    Although Contini may not qualify for a five star in all the categories of restaurant evaluation (they had paper napkins versus cloth napkins); the food and service are both five star.

After being seated we were greeted by the owner (Victor), who managed to greet and touch each guest that came through his doors.  He not only greeted us but stopped by during the meal to check on us and provide an excellent wine selection for my entree. Our main server (Mary) was exceptional. Service was attentive without being obtrusive.   We started with the olives and bread. The olive oil was exceptional and the olives were an eclectic mix. We had the mussels and the mozzarella for appetizers. Both were well presented and prepared. My companion had the pomodoro pasta dish but requested some specific changes that the server (and kitchen) cheerfully accommodated. I had the contadino pasta: wonderfully flavorful.

The odds were against me: There I was, in Edinburgh for first time ever, and instantly in need of a place for us to rest, recharge, and eat--and not too far from our hotel. To make the situation even more challenging, I was with my parents, who are not easily impressed, and will give up and go with the easiest eating option if there isn't a clear plan in place. But no way was I going to have my first meal in Scotland in our hotel. I had to think, fast. And then, across the street, draped in 4-star Yelp glory, was Centrotre.  Without Centotre (and the Yelp app), it would have been room service and sadness.  Instead, it was warm service and happiness! From decor to dessert, Centrotre was a carnival of old and new, delighting without overwhelming, and definitely different from what my parents were expecting from a seemingly random restaurant in Scotland.  My dad and I are big fans of gnocchi and shellfish, and the saffron-laced gnocchi with mussels had us fighting over bites. My step-mother and our family friend went for lighter options and seemed very satisfied. We ordered several types of bread--a rosemary focaccia and a rustic sourdough with ciabatta--and ate it all.  Moreover, I loved the fact that Centotre's \"Love happy food\" vision actively stands for exactly what it delivered to us--a happy (and tasty) moment for my family. Moral of the story: When in Edinburgh with your parents, go to Centotre!",

    "text": "\"I believe in miracles, since you came along, you sexy thing (sexy thing you!)\"  That's right, Monday night saw the inaugural night of the hunt for Edinburgh's best hot chocolate (that is assuming we don't all declare Centotre's to be the best and stop searching?).  An Italian restaurant isn't necessarily the first place you'd think to find great hot chocolate, and everybody else was tucking into a proper meal. But not us intrepid explorers! We were there for one thing, and one thing only. Delicious molten chocolate with a serving of steamed milk on the side. Our helpful waiter explained to us that the machine they used to serve up the chocolate has a long history of its own, having started out in a genuine Neapolitan restaurant eighty years ago and eventually made its way to colder climes. I've been to Naples, they don't need warming, comforting drinks, it's hot enough as it is (plus they have the best pizza in the world), so it's only fair that us freezing Scots get to use the magical machine nowadays.  And boy was that hot chocolate good! We'd heard tales of chocolate so thick it would stand up by itself, and to be honest that wasn't what arrived. Instead we got a cup of dark, slightly bitter, but oh some yummy chocolate, with a little pot of steamed milk to add as we wished. Some of us (Claire L) eschewed the milk and drank the chocolate as it was, whereas others added the whole jug in one go. I tried a bit of both, and frankly it was good either way.  I should mention too that because Caz had told Centotre that we were coming in for \"hot chocolate and cakes\" they'd very kindly made us up our own cupcakes, including a gluten free one. These were very nice too, and very well balanced - not like cupcakes that are more frosting than cake.  So far we've discovered that Centotre does a pretty mean hot chocolate, where to next?",
