    "text": "My initial quibble with this place are the prices on the menu but having forgotten to do a double-check of the copy displayed outside I can't definitely state that it is an out of date one. I'm of the belief that there were a bunch of dishes advertised at 7.95 that were nowhere to be seen on the copies we were given indoors. Possibly it was the lunch menu so I'm happy to be set right on that. Having got that out of the way my thoughts on the service (eye off the ball a bit in terms of water re-fills), decor and food are all positive. The selection of poppadom toppings was above average, my crab & veg springroll starter was very tasty and my main dish of beef with chilli and noodles was a good choice with a decent kick. My companion's tandoori chicken was also enjoyable and her boiled rice was nicely fluffy. All in an uncomplicated dining experience.",

    "text": "You fancy Thai food, your friend/partner/colleague is up for Indian food, you argue over it, one of you has to eat something you don't want, it all goes downhill... NO MORE!!! You can have it all at Mya, a restaurant that has both Thai and Indian menus, and a decent selection of dishes on either side. The quality of both is fairly even too, the dishes are well served and the staff are efficient if a bit abrupt sometimes. It is on a par with other restaurants in the area when it comes to price, and although you can probably find a better Indian or a better Thai restaurant, for the combination alone Mya ticks all the boxes. The decor is also a bit classier than your usual Indian restaurants, fairly minimal with key pieces giving it a touch of class, making it perfect for a date or a more intimate meal.",
