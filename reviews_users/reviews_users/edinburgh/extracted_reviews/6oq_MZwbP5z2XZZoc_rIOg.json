    "text": "It's a PIZZA HUT! They make pizza here. It is delicious. It is (not actually) a hut.  Coming from the deep south in the States, Pizza Hut brings up a strange mixture of feelings: mild embarrassment being the first and indigestion being the last. Upon entering most Pizza Huts you will be greeted with something that resembles a post-war restaurant that was forgotten in a bunker mid-'80s. The food, while edible, is so greasy you could swim in it--this is not a meal you will sit back afterward with a satisfied smile. This is the sort of food that will have you doing a furtive walk of shame out the door after.  I've known since entering the UK that American pizza chains are a horse of a different color. But Pizza Hut? Psht, no way even the UK could set PIZZA HUT to rights!  Behold my surprise when hubs and I decided to take the plunge and have a quick pizza one night. We were greeted by a whole host of pleasant young lads and lasses, the place was brightly lit and clean as a whistle, and we in no short order had requested our veggie pizza and were reaping the fruits of labor from the salad bar (I forgot how much I love salad bars, yessss). We then got a chance to fiddle with the soda machine, which allows you to mix and match and even add spurts of flavor--another thing I forgot I enjoyed, where they're a dime a dozen back home.  But dat pizza tho. IT WAS DELICIOUS. Perfect levels of crispy but soft crust with goat's cheese and vegetable toppings--needless to say we devoured every bite, no questions asked, and left happy customers. Extra bonus: the price! Psht, y'all know pizza hut be cheap as chips.  So go forth my fellow Edinburghers. Go forth and eat delicious pizza and do not be ashamed, for it is good.",

    "text": "The Pizza Huts in the UK are still restaurants.. unlike the states. This place was packed as there had been a rugby match that night and we had to wait about 30 minutes for a table and service which wasn't bad. Now since the place is like a restaurant, the prices are also like a restaurant. You cant get away with two large pizza's for $25. Our total for two (medium? large? who knows, they are one size) pizzas was $60. They do give you a place for the salad table- I say table because it was not big enough to be considered a salad bar... but since Europeans don't believe in ranch, it was a moot point. Pizza itself was good, and these Americans were happy!",

    "text": "Pizza was good, but most of my order wasn't delivered. I had to call and was told basically, that they knew they couldn't deliver the salad I ordered because of what was/was not delivered to their store that morning. Had they hoped that I would forget my own order? Also, my Hawaiian pizza was missing pineapple, a key ingredient. The 2 stars are for the quality of the pizza. I won't order from this establishment again.",

    "text": "This pizza hut restaurant has had a make over and is shiney shiney new.  I like the booths and free salad bar as well as the self service drinks.  They now have syrups that you can add to your drinks like cherry syrup to add to your lemonade, it is nice.  These guys know their stuff and do a mean pizza. I even got a little doggy bag to take my extra slices that I couldn't eat home with me.  Is it wrong to admit that I had them as a packed lunch the following day?    Really helpful waiting staff.",

    "text": "Pizza Hut's lunchtime buffet might have been a rare treat at high school, but nowadays it's just too much hassle. Fighting with proles and lardarses over the last bit of pepperoni is a hassle I can do without when I've got a deskload of soul destroying monotony to get through as soon as I leave. Inevitably I'd end up stuck with a few slices of margahrita / veggie \"surprise\", and a bitter taste in my mouth not entirely down to the e-coli ridden cheese.  It's popularity amongst screaming kids and Lidl shoppers means a sit down experience isn't great here at the best of times to be honest, but despite it's obvious, and numerous flaws, there's no denying the pizzas are fantastic in their own way. A greasy, saturated fat-laden Meat Feast won't do you any harm once in a while. Probably.",

I've always found the service to be speedy, the staff friendly and my children welcomed. The food is brought to the table piping hot and always served with a smile. The staff are constantly available should you require assistance.   I'm really impressed with this Pizza Hut. Any small niggles that may occur are quickly and pleasantly resolved, the staff really seem to care about their diners experience of their restaurant.",

    "text": "Overall, of the Pizza Huts in Edinburgh this is one of the better ones. I've eaten here several times and always been impressed by the service and the food.   I've mostly frequented the lunchtime buffet, and I'm pleased to say it's one of the better buffets I've been to. They keep the pizza coming constantly, and it clearly comes fresh from the oven straight away. The salad bar, too, is refreshed frequently and makes a nice fresh change from all that pizza!   The staff are friendly but don't hover over you while you eat and are easy to find when you need something.   If there is a disappointment here, it's in the toilets, which are literally the size of matchsticks. If you're a larger person, you may have trouble fitting in them.",
