    "text": "the monthly yelp dinner to try out new and exciting restaurants is always good fun, especially this months visit to Rodi.  this restaurant is a far venture from my usual side of town so probably some place i would have never visited had it not been for Blythe R's suggestion.  after a rather lengthy bus ride to the side of town followed by a very chilly walk past the EICC i spotted a glowing beacon of turkish food that was filled with fellow yelpers, warm bright colours, and the delicious smelling of grilled meats!  there were a good number of us and as in my usual style i was last to arrive.  however, i didn't need long to contemplate the menu and was quite happy to order when the waitress returned with my turkish tea.  i went for a starter of hummous followed by a grilled chicken dish.  i'm not sure how discrimatory i can be toward hummous as i love it and have yet to find any that hasn't been to my taste.  i was given a suitable portion size served along a basket of warm flat bread for dipping.  my rumbling tummy was suitably pleased and i started looking forward to the main course.  dishes took a bit to arrive as it appears everything is cooked fresh after you order.  there is a massive charcoal fire behind the register which is both warm and cosy for a cold night but also the palce where they grill all their meat.  which dishes did start to arrive we were given a number of side salads and dips and finally plentiful dishes of grilled meats with rice!  my grilled chicken sat atop a smoked aubergine dip and was accompanied by a side of rice and grilled flat bread.  the portion was HUGE.  seriously HUGE.  even after a hard run i was barely able to eat half before i was totally defeated.  but portion size aside, the chicken and aubergine and rice was super super tasty and i was sad to think i couldn't eat every bite!  the chicken was tender and juicy, the aubergine dip had a really lovely creamy smokey taste that mixed so well with both the chicken and the rice.  the salad dishes on the side were a nice veggie accompainment but i struggled to have more than a few forkfuls of these.  so overall i really really enjoyed Rodi.  the food was excellent and in the future i'd likely get a main dish to share with someone!  the staff are super friendly and the only negative point i can see is its rather far distance from where i live or tend to go out.  however, i would this a great place to get some dinner before the many festival shows at the EICC.",

    "text": "Our second night in Edinburgh we ventured out to Rodi, which was a quick walk from our hotel. After reviewing the menu online (thank you for having it available!), we convinced our 9-year old that he would be able to find something on the menu.  The setting is lovely, with brightly colored walls and lamps and the kitchen open to the dining area. We started with an order of falafel, which were crisp and delicious. Our son had never tried falafel before, and I'm glad this was his first encounter with it. The appetizer portion is five pieces, and our son devoured two of them.   For my main, I had the mixed skewer (chicken and lamb) and it was delicious. The marinade on the meat was warm, but not spicy, and both the lamb and the chicken were tender and perfectly cooked. The rice was tender and buttery, and the salad had a pleasing dressing. My husband's andana was flavorful and tender, and he said he definitely would order it again. Then there's our son, who as a bit skeptical of Turkish food, who ordered the chicken kebab and swapped the chips for rice. One bite of the chicken, and his eyes rolled to the back of his head - he was in love. He said it was one of the best things he ever tasted, and immediately asked for me to replicate it at home.   When I paid the bill, I asked Ali (our server and owner) how the meat on the kebabs is spiced/marinated, and Ali and his chef gave me a few pointers. They both were very pleased that our son's first encounter with Turkish food was in their restaurant and that the little guy enjoyed it.  Bottom line: Delicious food; welcoming staff; family-friendly; a gem in Edinburgh.",

The place is cosy and decorated with pretty lanterns, it was a little packed when we arrived but nothing out of the ordinary for Edinburgh on a Saturday evening. We had starters of grilled halloumi and tzatki sauce, they were delicious we practically inhaled it. I had the tavuk sis and the PIC had kuzu guvec. Perfect portions as we didn't feel overly stuffed, our waiter was very kind and offered us some tips about the city for our visit. Definitely enjoyed our meals down to the last bite, we would like to return to try more dishes one day.  PS. Everyone around us ordered by the bottle not the glass for wine...it's cheaper that way.",

We ordered a selection of starters between 5 of us and they threw in an extra one for free which was really nice. The bread that came with them was really fresh and tasty as well.   For the mains we had a selection of skewers and casserole and all the food was really tasty.   The portions were also a good size so no one (and there were some big guys) were left hungry.   Nice decor as well and all reasonably priced.  I will definitely be going back.",

One complaint comes immediately to mind - it would have made a lot more sense if they had offered to take our drink orders before we ordered our food.  That way, we wouldn't have had to sit with our respective thirsts until after we made our choices from the menu.  All in all, Rodi is a quaint and lovely place.  The dining experience would have been even more pleasant if they had more space between the tables...  Despite the above complaints, all the food we tried was tasty and reasonably priced.  Additionally the portions were huge and the prices were reasonable.  I recommend Rodi, especially if you're in the mood for something a bit different :-)",

For my starter I went for the Sucuk - a heavily spiced beef sausage that was served with salad. One thing you notice in this place is the intoxicating wafts coming from the grill - having been hungry on arrival by the time my starter arrived I was pretty much drooling. The sausage was delicious, served on a small salad and with some bread on the table it didn't need anything else. This was a sausage celebration. Huzzah to the humble banger!  For my main I opted for the lamb spare ribs, served with rice and pida ( a really nice flatbread) as well as the various salads they brought to the table. Of the salads I really liked the charred onions with pomegranate - as Blythe.R said they are intense....I like intense.  The ribs were meaty, flavoursome and plentiful....basically my ideal kind of plate. A few extra napkins would have been handy but I demolished the ribs in records time with a big smile on my face. Always a good sign.  All in all this is a surprising gem of a place! Rodi comes highly JD Recommended!",

The interior is decorated with bright colours and there is one room with plenty of space for larger parties.  They have a BYOB theme.  As a starter I ordered the Hummus with was served with a few slices of cucumber and an olive and not to mention the tasty bread. Personally I found the Humus a bit bland, but if you want to spice it up you can add some salt and pepper or other....... Then came the main with plenty of salad  (carrots, leaves, reddish..) and Turkish bread served on the side. I went for a vegetarian Guvec topped with Feta cheese. The food comes slightly burned, which  intenses the flavour. Very tasty.  I heard that this is their trademark. Even our dessert, rice pudding, had a burned surface.  The restaurant is kept clean and the staff was very polite. Prices for the meals are affordable.",

    "text": "My bedroom when I was a young teen was blue and orange - walls, ceiling and carpet all deep royal blue; all furniture, skirting boards and door and window frames were the brightest bright orange. So in a way, walking into the orangey warmth of Rodi and enjoying its shots of deep blue felt a little bit like coming home.  The effect was enhanced by the friendly welcome of the staff, and of course of the lovely Yelpers gathered around the table. It felt like a family dinner in somebody's vibrant, exotic home.  Ahhh and what a dinner. The sucuk starter was blissful - chunks of spicy sausage on fresh crispy lettuce - I could eat that any day of the week and be completely happy. My main, a beautiful chicken affair, was tender, succulent, flavoursome and seriously bountiful. My mighty appetite faltered and failed me in the face of such plenty... But not so much as to eschew the offer of rice pudding for dessert.  You all know about compartments, right? How the stomach totally has a savoury compartment and a pudding compartment? Well that's what was going on here. I was completely full in my main compartment but plenty of room for a bit of pudding.  The rice pudding surprised me as it was cold - but I liked it a lot; rich and creamy, it was a lovely new way for me to try it. The top was burnt - I think it was meant to be that way and I could see how it was supposed to work, to give a sharper kick to the sweet pudding, but it didn't quite go, for me. I ended up scooping out from underneath.  Aside from the front door, which had a tendency to stick open and let in the cold when someone entered or exited and meant that the staff frequently had to scoot over and close it (something they were always very prompt in doing) the restaurant is a lovely place. I imagine its location opposite the EICC will mean it's rarely short of business, especially in August. And if that means that Rodi continues for a long time to come, that can only be a good thing, because I definitely want to come back. Lots of times.",

    "text": "Food was decent, albeit bit pricy for the amount and quality. The waiter knocked down my beer bottle, which wasn't a problem as it happens, but he spilled about 10% of it and I didn't get another one. We got a plate of some dipping sauce as an apology instead. Also he only kept asking me if I wanted anything else, gave me the bill and only thanked me at the end, completely ignoring my (female) friend. It was uncomfortable experience. I won't be coming back.",

    "text": "Showcasing an impressive open charcoal barbecue, Rodi has transformed what was previously a rather small corner chippy into an excellent new Turkish restaurant, with room for around 30 diners.  I've eaten a fair amount of Turkish food, over the years, particularly on my regular jaunts to Istanbul. The food on offer here compared very favourably, with their meat extremely tender, and the main course portion absolutely vast. As an illustration, I had no need of breakfast the next day after dining here, as I was still full.   Overall, we said: \"Rodi is a really welcome new addition to the dining circuit. Once they've grown in to their new premises a little more, I'm confident they will become a firm favourite with Edinburgh diners, as their food is delicious. I look forward to my next visit, and would strongly recommend that you pay it a visit.\"",
