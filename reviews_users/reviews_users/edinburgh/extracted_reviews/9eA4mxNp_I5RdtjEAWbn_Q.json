    "text": "I was walking along Rose street and almost half a block away I could smell meaty goodness. I drew closer and saw a staff member carving up pulled pork meat. The other thing I noticed was that the A-Board showed very reasonable prices and that the meat is oven cooked for 18 hours. I also noticed the 'not for profit' coffee and plug points for charging phones. The woman was very friendly and ran the shop solo. This was quite a feat, considering how busy the shop got. I was lured in with the smells, and won over with the food. I bought a pulled pork wrap with crackling. I had chilli hot sauce and cheese. Basic but yummy.",

    "text": "Sad to report I'm not at all impressed. I was expecting a roll filled with hot, flavourful shredded pork topped with just enough apple sauce and crispy, salty crackling. I don't feel it's a big ask.   Instead I got lukewarm soggy pork, completely tasteless, drowned in apple sauce (only at the front, not topping the pork) and a sad little bit of crackling.   What a disappointment! I expected so much more flavour and feel like I wasted calories eating this meal.   On a more positive note, service is quick a very friendly. Unfortunately that's not enough to bring me back here and I have no plans to return.",

    "text": "Hot on the heels of my review of oink I came across this new addition to Rose St at the weekend!  Pig In a Poke is a new, trendy looking, upmarket version of its competition with some space for dining and lots of cool wood panelling.  With a selection of rolls to choose from these guys also give you a slightly wider choice when in comes to toppings! I went for the braised red cabbage and apple sauce and darn gosh if it want just a damn tasty roll.  My one critique of oink has been their ever edging upwards price.....these guys are going to keep them honest. For a size-able roll they are charging 3.80 making it a very affordable lunch time option for workers!!  Pig in a Poke comes highly Jd Recommended",

    "text": "I feel a bit 'meh' about this place. I want to give them a second chance - maybe they were having a bad day when I went on, or maybe I was?  Simple concept - pig (shredded pork) in a poke, or a roll/wrap. I opted for the roll. We were offered stuffing and 'sauce' but I was left a little baffled by the menu and not sure if I could ask for things like cracking, apple sauce, coleslaw etc. because they were on the board but I wasn't offered them. Also slightly baffled by the server who (jokingly??) shook his head when I tried to order a roll like I'd ask for the wrong thing or said it in the wrong way *shrug*.  So what I got was slightly dry pork and stuffing on a roll. The pork tasted okay, but is like to try it properly with something to add moisture to the whole thing.  Ah well",

    "text": "When Jurgen's review of Pig in a Poke came up on my feed I immediately thought, I'm having some of that! And I did. Lunchtime came and off I popped to Rose Street, conveniently only a few minutes walk from my work place, and sought out some delicious pulled pork.  And did it live up to the first, glowing review? Yes, I'd say it did.   It's cheaper than Oink, although the portion size was a little smaller. This isn't necessarily a bad thing though, as the Oink rolls can be a struggle to finish. The pork itself is very good (maybe not *as* good as Oink's, but still pretty tasty) and as Jurgen says in his review there's a wider selection of condiments to go with your pork. Today there was apple sauce, bbq sauce and coleslaw. I'm a coleslaw fiend so I couldn't see beyond that, and it was a good choice as the slightly tangy, crunchy slaw complimented the soft, yielding pork very well. There's also a choice of breads - a white roll, a crusty wholemeal and a flour wrap if that's your thing.  My only criticism would be that the serving of coleslaw was a bit mean, as was the crackling I was given. That and I feared for my teeth when eating the crackling.  Pig in a Poke very nearly gets 5 stars, and in many respects surpasses its main rival. But not quite. It is however, great value for money and close to my work (something that neither of the Oinks are) so I can foresee this becoming a regular lunchtime treat!",

    "text": "Stumbled across pig in a poke whilst out for lunch, hadn't noticed it before.  Concept is pretty simple, the main ingredient is pulled pork  you can pick up a roll with choice of sauce for 3.50 or soup and roll for 5.50 which is a great price.  Would definitely recommend the food the pork was moist and the stuffing and crackling is worth getting, the only draw back I had was that the service could have been quicker and more organised particulary at lunch time, I ordered soup but they had just ran out and needed to heat more...I had already payed for soup so decided to wait the 5 mins until new soup was heated, after waiting several minutes I was then told that the soup I had ordered wasn't the one being heated up but a curried soup...don't like curry...gutted. Ended up getting money back for soup as didn't have time to wait again. So in total...food is good and well worth checking out...I'd definitely go there again...just hope it's a bit better organised",

    "text": "Not sure what \" Pig in a Poke \" means but I will tell you I ate it like a pig eating slop! It was really really good and I was happy like a pig in the mud. Haha ok enough with the pig puns and such , this place was really good. I happened to trot on by the other day and went on in. The place is in a very good location to get the tourists and the locals such as myself. Well it was feeding time for me so I decided to get some porker in a tortilla role with the BBQ sauce and some crackling . For the price I was impressed, it was cheaper then what I usually pay and the BBQ sauce was not bad at all. The gentleman and lady who served me were very polite and cheerful. They asked me where I was from, so I went through my routine, I am from Seattle Yadda Yadda Yadda, and who would a thought the gentleman said his boss called up and told him that if your Canadian or American you got a free size upgrade since it was Thanksgiving! ( Didn't know Canada celebrated Thanksgiving) So that was very nice of them and made my day. Pork itself was nice and tender perfectly well balanced moister, not to wet but not to dry reminded me of mexican carnitas  that use a similar style of pork.  I will be back again for feeding time and have my \" Pig in a poke\" .",
