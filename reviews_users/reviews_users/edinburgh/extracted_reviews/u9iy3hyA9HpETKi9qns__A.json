    "text": "I came here on a few occasions as I was staying next door and thought the food was just \"ok\".  I'm deducting a few stars for a few reasons.  The main reason is that much of the menu is served with fish (either as an accompaniment or mixed in) and as I have an allergy to seafood, I couldn't get much of the food (for example, any of the curries).  I asked if it could be made without the seafood ingredient and was told that it was already mixed into the sauce.  I get that things are fresh, but how can you not take into account those with allergies?  And if made fresh, why can't you leave it out?  I believe I got the wrong sauce with the Roti Canai that was ordered as I've never had that type of sauce served with it before - was a tangy red sauce of some kind which did not go well with the bread, which was very greasy.  The onion and ginger chicken lacked flavor.    Overall, it was ok, but nothing compared to what other reviewers have said.  Maybe it's an off night in the kitchen.",

Unfortunately, it showed in the quality. Maybe its just me living in London, spoilt by the choice of Malaysian food here, but this was just OK. Pricing was also a bit on the expensive side I thought.  What was good? Roti Canai was decent, as was the steamed sea bass and cha kway teow. Skip the teh tarik, and the egg custard buns.",

Being part of the quarter mile I expected this place to be a massive rip off, but our group of 9 all had 2 courses and drinks and it came to 24 including service.   Quality wise I felt things were a bit mixed. I was pretty underwhelmed by my main (which I've forgotten the name of but it was the first chicken dish on the menu.) serving it in a banana leaf was a nice touch but actually I found it inconvenient. My friends dishes were all pretty damn tasty though, I think I just wasn't a lucky one.   This place doesn't quite smash it, but the staff were attentive and lovely, and we're happy to cater for our large group.",

The place is nicely decorated and pretty slow when we got there so getting a table was easy. The menu is straight forward. There was no lunch menu... Boo... Considering its next to the university campus you'd think they would offer a lunch special especially for students. They have the typical dishes you'd find in Malaysian restaurant so there's no special dish they specifically make. Since its thanksgiving, I ordered a roasted chicken... Closest to a turkey with rice. Te chicken was cooked well and seasoned so didn't need to put any salt or pepper. It came in a soy sauce base sauce so it further seasoned the chicken. In addition, there was a tomato base sauce that was on the side. The sauce didn't do much for the chicken so I stuck with the soy sauce. The dish was good overall and have no complaint about the flavour.   The staff were pretty quick and was helpful. The location is great if you need to be at the university campus it's very close, good choice for a quick lunch.",

From my first impression walking in, it looked very inviting and cozy. The staff there were very attentive, seating us and taking our orders quite quickly, there was not a long wait for the food to arrive too, luckily! I was starving!   When comparing with what I can get back home, I have had better Char Kuay Teow before, but for Edinburgh, it was delicious and the portions were very generous, I had to take away half of mine since I could not finish it. My non-Malaysian friend tried the nasi lemak and milo and pronounced both 'delicious' and had a very good impression of Malaysian food and would be willing to come back for more.  The biggest drawback from me giving the place 5 stars is how expensive it is. While I should not compare prices, it is very painful for me sitting down and shelling out 10 on a dish I know would clock in at the most 2.50 back home. The prices could definitely be lowered.  Overall, the food and atmosphere was lovely. While I would love to be a frequent visitor of Nanyang, the price for me may stop me from visiting more than every few months at a time.",

    "text": "Love Malaysian food. Love it. So when the Mrs took me for a stroll through the Quarter Mile development, my eyes lit up to see a new Malaysian restaurant coming our way. Before I knew it Nanyang had arrived and, like a mongoose, I was ready to pounce as soon as it opened.  After a starter of Soft Shell Crab, I plumped for my Malaysian staple (and the bar by which I will henceforth measure all asian fusion restaurants) of Beef Rendang. The crab was tremendous and the Rendang was different, not as dry as traditionally expected and also slightly hotter, but as tasty as ever I'm used to.  The hostess was warm and welcoming and happy to chat about the business and how they couldn't wait to get started any longer and their plans for finishing off the decorating in the following few weeks. The waiter was apologetic and charming and offered us a complimentary round of drinks to celebrate their opening. All good.  The menu was expansive, not exclusively Malaysian as it turns out, and definitely for those with an eye for the spicy. The decor and surrounding areas are very pretty and it's also good for those who enjoy a good people watch. In honesty there really isn't anything bad to say about the place...  Except this:  If Nanyang are not careful, they are in danger of pricing themselves out the market. Kampong Ali is no more than a 5 minute walk away, and Kampung Ah Lee is 10 minutes in the other direction. Both are a good 2-3 cheaper per dish and the quality is just as good, if not better than Nanyang.   With a small Malaysian restaurant contingent within Edinburgh, and if they improve their website and advertising (aside from the students and the rich who frequent or live in the Quarter Mile respectively, who else really knows there's anything down there?) they might last a while, but as soon as others cotton on that there are just as tasty Malaysian cuisine options at cheaper prices within walking distance, Nanyang could feel the pinch.  Very good, but be warned.",

Anyway, I haven't tried any other Malaysian food here in Edinburgh, but I did enjoy a good beef rendang back when I lived in NYC. I did not really care for the rendang at Nanyang though...the beef did not seem slow cooked and tender like I was used to, I found it quite chewy and tough. The sauce wasn't creamy and instead was mostly just chewy shredded coconut. Since I haven't had much Malaysian food around here yet, maybe this is the style, it just was not what I was used to (usually like it with a much creamier sauce with coconut milk) and I did not care for it. I probably won't be back anytime soon as it seems there are better Malaysian places nearby.",

This time I had an itison voucher. I had wanted to try Nanyang but was worried that being GF might be a problem, so I thought 12 for two mains means it wouldn't have been a waste if options were limited.  The itison deal gives theree options - thai green curry, massaman curry and a Malayisan curry. Due to suspect and non GF ingredients, I was advised the Malayisan curry was my only option which was ok with me. The mains came with coconut rice and they were plentiful portions. The food was lovely - well spiced, with huge chunks of chicken in my curry, and vegetables. My friends beef massaman curry was enjoyed but she would have preferred the typical big chunks of beef, rather than slices of piece.   We did both enjoy our meals and staff were friendly and attentive and took care to check I was getting the right food. I would go back to Nanyang, but much of the menu was off limits to me, hence the 3 star review. My friend who had also lived in Thailand, was surprised by the amount of wheat containing dishes so I'd like to check out other, Thai/Malaysian restaurants in the Burgh to see if this is the norm.",

The staff are SUPER lovely. Very kind and took the time to have a chat with us. Also, they kindly gave us two free drinks after the meal. As they had only been open 7 days when we visited, the seemed slightly nervous but they went out of their way to make a good impression, and they certainly did that!  As for the food, most of the dishes are labelled as spicy, and they are that. But perfectly so for me. I had the squid dish and it was delicious, i definitely have it again.
