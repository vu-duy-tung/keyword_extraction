    "text": "Dim Sum is slightly oddly named in that the menu doesn't include Dim Sum but it does include lots of very yummy Japanese food. They never seem too busy and our order was delivered within 40 minutes on a Friday night.   They have a good selection of sushi and maki which includes a few veggie options and friends who had had the fish say it's good and fresh. Where they really excel is the cooked food, it comes in beautiful dishes, well presented and the udon came with the broth in a separate pot so the noodles didn't go soggy. My favourite dish is Tori Curry also known as chicken katsu curry. It's super tasty and a huge portion. I think I've ordered it three times now.",

    "text": "We all know that Edinburgh isn't exactly a Sushi Heaven, so please take that into account. Some leeway is given when reviewing sushi places because what's 4 and 5 star here is 2 and 3 star in other parts of the world *gives Californians warning looks*  Dim Sum Sushi is pretty darn good when you take into account it is 1. Edinburgh and 2. A delivery place! I've now ordered twice form here and recieved really good quality meals each time, that were packed carefully (with a fair bit of thought) and arrived quickly.  I ordered via a centralised ordering website that has a phone app, not directly, but have spoken to the staff on the phone (they wanted to double check a delivery time) and would say that online ordering ordering is probably the way to go.  So, the food. I've ordered a range of sushi - mango maki, tuna maki and salmon maki which arrived in individual boxes each with wasabi and ginger and were really good fresh quality. My chilli tuna salad was a bit hotter than I'd thought it would be but was delicious!  Previously I ordered the seabass special, which came with rice and some pretty/tasty garnishes.  What really sells me on this place is the miso. You know good miso? Yeah, it's amazing. And this place does good miso that is filled with plenty of nice bits!    My go to for when I want sushi, but have no intention of putting on pants.",

    "text": "I live out near Wester Hailes and this is the only sushi place that will deliver to my post code, via scoffable. As I am from the states, I'm used to a huge variety of sushi available from many different restaurants. Since this is the only place that delivers to me I decided to take my chances. I ordered it and it arrived within the hour (though that's just as much deliver service as the restaurant). The menu isn't very extensive, particularly the maki itself but I ordered what I usually get, a rainbow roll, and both the spicy tuna and spicy salmon maki rolls (I can put sushi back like a sumo wrestler). As I said, it arrived very quickly after I ordered which I was happy about. The sushi smelled fresh, and came with a large portion of pickled ginger (yay!) and some wasabi and soy sauce. I probably could have used a bit more soy sauce and wasabi but I got by. I ate my rainbow roll first. I don't know if this is a cultural difference but there was only some fish on top (only two kinds, not three) topped with green tobiko and avocado and cucumber inside so it wasn't very filled. But it tasted good and fairly fresh and I happily had room for the rest. My spicy tuna and salmon maki rolls were more rice than fish (this was a bit disappointing) and the \"spicy\" sauce tasted more like not spicy spring onion, rather than traditional spicy mayo. However, again, the fish was good and the rice was sticky and cooked well. I would definitely order from here again and not only because it's the only place that delivers to my address.",
