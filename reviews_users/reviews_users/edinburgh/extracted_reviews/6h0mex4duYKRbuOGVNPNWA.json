The fish was nice and flaky and the chips nice and crisp. I probably wouldn't stop in here just to have lunch, but was a nice place to grab a bite when visiting the Botanic Garden.",

Portions were big. So tick for value. Tasty too, so another tick. We ordered Mayo but original waitress forgot it and we had to reorder. Service, average, speedy.   It's really a nice setting but it does have an open feel about it.",

    "text": "Thankfully the Royal Botanic Gardens are still free. If this addition to the site was any indicator of the way forward then it would become an expensive pleasure to enjoy.   Whilst the absence of a service charge is laudable the price of 10.50 for a Full Scottish Breakfast makes it clear at what end of the market the restaurant is pitching itself. At some point I may bite the bullet and sample this but currently I doubt, as with all such prices for such a meal, that it will be worth it.   Unfortunately I forgot to photograph the two starters I had in today's visit (the five main courses were all dearer and seemingly more filling than I was after that early in the afternoon) but safe to say that nouvelle is the name of the day. The food itself was dubious - pumpkin soup heated to within an inch of it's life in the microwave (tasty when an asbestos mouth was not required to eat it) served with a decent slice of walnut bread (memory fails me on that note) and butter that was rock hard from only just coming out of the fridge - a schoolboy error if ever there was one. The duck liver parfait was a good size but, as with many places, the amount of accompanying substance on which to spread it was rather too small to stop one feeling like a pig when making it go 4 ways and then filling one's gob. The chutney was in a dinky wee glass jar but that was also one affectation too far.   No complaints about the staff and service or the general ambience and I've chucked my business card into the bowl in the hope of winning dinner for two but that's probably the only reason I'd go back to eat here. In future the most I'm likely to bother with is a cuppa.",

    "text": "Poor. Museum cafes are always going to be a bit of a fleecing but to be a fleecing with such rotten service is very special indeed. The food was so-so. 9 for a sandwich and chips with these presented in a silly, pretend frying basket. (Hate that). The main issue was how glacially slow this entire proceeding was. Our kid's ice cream never arrived and the excuse was an overwhelmed kitchen staff. In a half empty restaurant? It was more likely to be a poorly managed kitchen and poorly trained staff. We asked to pay without having received our child's dessert. We were not charged for the dessert.  I asked the manager what the deal was and she said they had let in too many people who did not have reservations. Smells like bull to me. Don't bother. The Botanics is always a nice treat but step out of the place for a snack. Really.",

    "text": "Unless you are looking for a completely uninspired breakfast experience, I would give the Gateway Restaurant a miss. I had heard that lunching here was recommendable and so, I hoped that perhaps breakfast might be worthwhile. Of course, the venue is beautiful, located as it is in the John Hope Gateway. But, warming the croissants could not mask how stale they were. The Aberdeen buttery did not seem much fresher. The stacked Scotch pancakes, were unimaginatively presented. Do not expect the wait staff to be able to provide any details about the presence of nut contamination in any of the food - despite the menu stating that they will.  The reason that our waitress could not give us any details about possible nut contamination of course, was because all pastries are bought in from outside. This is not the first time I have been confronted with this issue and I still find it unacceptable that a restaurant, even if a food item is brought in from a bakery, cannot furnish the customer with details of ingredients, or other information relevant to the food item. Most disappointingly I suppose, was the fact that the food was not made in house. Why is it that a restaurant cannot bake/make its own food? I assume that they do have a kitchen and cooks. I know from personal experience that a scone, a pancake, a loaf of bread are not complex undertakings in the kitchen.  I cannot fault the wait staff; they were pleasant enough. (Though some training from management might have been in order for our poor waitress was most thoroughly stumped when we asked her to enlighten us as to what an Aberdeen buttery was).  Pleasant service though cannot make up for poor quality food. So, if you want to impress out-of-town guests, serve them a nice breakfast at home and head straight to the botanic gardens bypassing the Gateway Restaurant.",

It was meltingly hot in the glass framed building, and we were desperate for a drink of water and looking forward to a proper tea service. But thanks to the waiters to seemed to idling around chatting, we couldn't order anything and after a while sweating in the heat, got bored. So left. The manager kindly noted that I left my bag but didn't bother to ask why we left without ordering. Oh well!",

    "text": "I thoroughly recommend a visit to the gardens for anyone coming to Edinburgh however I must warn others about the service (or lack of) in the new 'John Hope Gateway' restaurant. The staff are very rude and look down their noses at (1) those with small children and (2) lone customers.   After a lovely spring morning walk around the gardens taking in the snowdrops and other lovely sights, I decided to stop for a spot of lunch and an hour or so doing some work on my laptop. I had noticed previously that the new coffee bar/restaurant had wifi facilities so I decided to check it out. after ascending the stair leading up to the restaurant I was greeted by a rather serious looking female staff member, when I mentioned my desire for a coffee and light lunch (as well as to use my laptop for a while) her reply could not have been more negative -continuing in the first instance with 'ok although 'we have nowhere for you to plug in the laptop' her reply left me with the impression that they really didn't like to encourage the use of laptops in the 'restaurant'. (so why advertise free wifi?) The waitress then sat me down at a small table right beside the staircase and when I asked if i could sit further away (my reason being to have a quiet little corner away from the noise of the foyer downstairs so that I could do my work) she replied in the negative stating that all other tables were booked -a blatant lie as it was late morning and there were many empty tables and I observed that many other couples coming in after me were given the choice to sit at other ends of the premises. This really angered me as it was so obvious and made me feel ostrocised for being on my own. I was so annoyed that when they came to take my order I only asked for a coffee and skipped the lunch as I did not see why I should pay 5 for a sandwich when I couldn't even sit where I wanted to   I have been a visitor to the gardens my whole life and really felt quite insulted. I will continue visiting the gardens although will avoid the 'john hope gateway' services in future, I advise others to do the same.",
