    "text": "Topkapi - Top Kebab!  On my brother's recommendation, I ate here earlier this evening.   He had the Donner & I the Lamb Shish Kebab.   Both were presented in a tray with salad separate and the kebab in a wholemeal pitta.   We sat down to tuck into our meal. My Shish Kebab was gorgeous. The lamb was lovely and tender & the sweet chilli and mint marinade very tasty indeed.   My brother allowed me to try some of the donner meat, which was very good too.   Personally, I'd have preferred the kebabs to be a little larger, but this is an extremely minor point.   Staff were also friendly.",

In Australia, what I call a kebab is called schwarma here. That's really more what I was looking for, but at midnight on a Friday I ended up here.   Not impressed. It was quite busy and I found the staff to be very rude. They took my partners order then went away before coming back to take my order after I stared them down and stated this was the same order- why wasn't I being served?  I'm also pretty sure the meat was served in a tortilla- never in my life have I had a kebab wrapped in a tortilla or wrap bread, its usually wrapped in Turkish bread.   The chips were also taken out of the cooked tray, re- cooked and served to me. I'm I'm paying money I would at least expect not getting recycled food.   Overall unimpressed. The staff looked bored and uninterested and it was reflected in the quality of the food.",

There was no line and our food was ready in about 10min; we ordered kebab and it came in a pita bread with lettuce and tomatoes and white sauce; the service of meat was very large and overall it was really tasty; kebab is usually my go to drunkish food and i am glad to say i have found a convenient stop to go near where i live :)",

But I do have to admit that they have one of the best chicken kebabs I've tasted, even sober. The place is open until really late especially at weekends for the people coming out the clubs and can be very busy but if you do have to wait it is worth it and there is also a small seating area inside the place. Well worth a visit",

Portions are generous, chicken is well marinated and tasty and salad is fresh and crunchy. Chilli sauce has a slight kick but deson't overpower and a hint of mint takes the edge off. With kebabs this good you don't even need to wait until pub closing time to justify getting one. Pick one up for your dinner sometime.",

We had a shish kebab and the meat was absolutely beautiful. Seasoned perfectly and very tender, just how it should be. Bread was so so though.   Portion was a little smaller than we would have hoped for but we'll definitely be back for more (especially considering the location).   Best kebab we've had so far in Edinburgh",
