    "text": "Dragon Way seems surprisingly little known given its location and long establishment. It shouldn't be! Perhaps this is because it is overshadowed by the ever popular music venue Henry's Cellar Bar below it.  I've been to Rainbow Arch several times now and each time it seems to get better and better. It's a dim sum specialist so while there... try some dim sum! You'll find some more creative and unusual varities. The alternative menu is decent too.  The general aesthetic of place isn't incredible but not terrible either. It had a sort of old-school Chinese restaurant feel. Sometimes the tablecloth and menus don't seem that new either.  I've heard that the staff are not always the most friendly but every time I've been in I've always found them to be helpful and perfectly amiable.  Also keep in mind that Raindbow Arch closes late, around 3am, making it one of the few decent late night restaraunts in Edinburgh.  A really great dim sum restaurant in the heart of Edinburgh,",

    "text": "Ok, so maybe dim sum is the way to go on this place. The nice thing is that they have it all the time, and this place is open late (though they closed at 11 when I was there, despite teh giant OPEN TILL 3 AM sign). So maybe call first.  It was... fine. We had duck and char sieu on rice and hot and sour soup. Though the soup had nice flavour, it was SO corn-starchy and gelatenous that you could probably walk on the surface. Or call it hot n' sour custard. But maybe that was just that batch.  Hmm, I didn't see what other reviewers saw, but oh well.",

    "text": "I know this is ridiculous, but this is seriously one of the best dimsum restaurants I've ever been to--and I've lived in Hong Kong.  The deep-fried custard buns are out of this world (and I've never actually found them at any other dimsum restaurant), and other dimsum staples like the peanut dumplings, shrimp crepes, and chicken feet are all quite good, too.  The wait staff can be super-nice or super-grumpy (depends on the person, the day, etc.), but the food is always great. A few tips: - For dimsum, go at night!  Counterintuitive, I know, but I think their dimsum chef comes at night, because the dimsum (esp. aforementioned custard buns!) are seems much fresher at night. - If you're getting a soup, I recommend bringing your own containers--they don't have great containers for taking soup home.  Definitely recommended.",

    "text": "I was umming and ahhing over whether to give Rainbow Arch three or four stars, as I've had mixed experiences with their food, but in the end I decided on four for the following FOUR [see what I did there] reasons:   1. The dim sum selection is, in my opinion, great. The mooli cakes are incredible, and all the dim sum I've had here has been tasty- my bad experiences have been when I went for items on the regular menu, as dishes such as beef ho fun noodles were ridiculously oily and MSG-esque, while my beef and egg dish turned out to be a pile of mince with a raw egg on top There was no mention of the rawness on the menu However, I'm supposed to be listing reasons why I gave four stars, and as long as you go for the dim sum I doubt you'd be disappointed   2. If you get a big enough group together you get a big circular table with a lazy susan in the middle which you can spin around to get food from the other side of the table/to steal something that someone else wants to eat/just for amusement [I'm easily amused]   3. It's around the corner from the filmhouse and just down the road from the cameo and is open all day until 3am, so there is always somewhere to go after a film gets out, which is delightful   4. Hmm The staff are sort of mean, so I can't say anything that great about them, they are quite shouty And the toilets are in Henry's Cellar Bar next door, which smells quite unpleasant OH drinks! Drinks are cheap. There we go. I'm starting to doubt my four star choice now, but I'm feeling generous, and the dim sum really is nice [and that lazy susan really is amusing] so there we go.",

    "text": "I was not very impressed with the Rainbow Arch. The staff there were rude and the place did not seem very clean. (I have since learned they have had several health code violations over the years and I have to say I am not surprised.)   The food was not bad, but not that great either. Also it was all kind of expensive for the portion sizes.   Overall the experience was not a great one and I will not be going back.",
