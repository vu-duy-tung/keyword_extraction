I would recommend paying a visit to Bar Napoli just up the road though, if you're already in this neck of the woods and are in the mood for Italian food.",

Anyway, once we got our menus we proceeded to order our food and drinks.   From then on, i cannot really fault any of the service or the food, or the price.   It was fairly busy for a tuesday night too, and seemed short staff, but the staff that were in managed to please us.",

    "text": "Wanted to try Italian when in Edinburgh. In fact my wife was more keen for it. Bella Italia has a good reputation so was our first choice. Choose the Royal Mile branch and went in with my family including my 1 yr old kid. After ordering had to wait for almost 1 hour to get our food as it seems the kitchen had collapsed due to untimely exit of the chef for some personal problems. That's fine as it can happen to anyone. The only reason I am giving this low score is cause we were not informed about this and they kept us waiting. And one can understand to wait so long with a 1 yr kid.  It was almost 1 hr after we came to know and the manager was no where to be seen. Food was good and can give 3 star for that. But not pleased at all with service. Next time if I ever go will ask waiting time first and then order. I never expect this from such a reputed restaurant. No one would I assume.",

The menu is simple and has all the usual expected options from an Italian menu. We all ordered different pastas, and they came to the table looking exactly the same. Luckily our server could tell them apart.   My Lenticchie pasta was al dente (very important) and the lentil and mushroom ragu gave a depth of flavor to the tomato sauce base. The portion was generous and was filling for a lunch meal. More importantly, I liked that they donate a portion of the sales to a charity. A full belly and helping others out!",

I had the queen margherita and expected as the description detailed,  a pizza with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and basil sitting on top.  What I got was a cheese pizza.  The sauce was not very detectable although I know some was there and the fresh mozzarella was baked into the rest of the cheese.  Are my expectations off and too California when I want what I feel is authentic?  You know, the visible marinara and clear slices of mozzarella without the shredded cheese encumbering it?  Anyway, see photo for what they feel is a margherita pizza.  I think it's way off.  The crust seemed under cooked as well.  Just by a tiny bit.",

Both served fresh in the very hot pan and very tasty for those of us who don't do additional salt anymore. The teat was great but the orange juice was a bit watery. I'd skip that next time.

The menu is very clearly labelled which items are gluten free and there was so many to choose from. My favourite italian dish is a carbonara so it was no surprise this was my choice alongside a garlic and mozzarella pizza bread.  Oh my days ... the pizza bread was outstanding!! It has been so long since i have had a decent garlic bread and this really hit the spot. A thin and crispy base with plenty of garlic and cheese. 10/10  The carbonara was delightful too. The waiter took the time to explain that there might be a small delay in order to cook the gf pasta but to be honest we didnt really notice.  My bf had the burger and was mighty impressed.  Thank you bella italia for an impressive gluten free menu. I will definetly be back!!",

I ordered Pollo alla Crema, having had it a few years before and remembering it to be pretty tasty. It wasn't great, the pasta in particular, but edible and I was really hungry. My friend's bruschetta looked good though and a very geneous portion. The wines by the glass aren't cheap, but the house white I had was perfectly okay.

I've eaten here quite a few times, and for an extremely busy restaurant, which also happens to be a chain, I'm repeatedly surprised by the quality of the food!  Bella Italia has two branches in Edinburgh, one at Northbridge, and my personal favourite at Hanover. Technically, there's no noticeable difference between the two branches; I'd even say the one at Northbridge looks nicer,  and has some pleasant outdoor seating for those few and cherished days when the sun shines in Edinburgh (jokes jokes...)  For some reason, I've repeatedly trekked all the way to Princes street, turned on to Hanover, and treated myself to the greatest pizzas and desserts! I've eaten here because I was bored, for a break from shopping, and then for my 19th birthday dinner! Service is great, and on one occasion, my pizza was diligently replaced (after I'd devoured half of it) when the waitress realized an ingredient was missing from my order. More pizza for me, so I wasn't complaining!  I would definitely recommend Bella for just about every dining occasion; dinner with friends, a large group, a date.. and they're also very affordable. The banoffee pie should not go untasted!   As I've written this, I'm quite tempted to head back real soon; I even managed to score a free umbrella from a member of staff last December, so I definitely feel appreciated as well!",

    "text": "Bella Italia seem to have been around for eternity. While more modern twists have been applied to the Italian restaurant, Bella has simply stuck to its original brief.  Expect all the usual Italian fare and with a standard level of polish. They often do a pizza/wine combo which is always there to coax the punters in, but it's just not an establishment that tempts me over the likes of Pizza Express.  This particular branch seems to be too busy most of the time and thus I often wander straight past.",
