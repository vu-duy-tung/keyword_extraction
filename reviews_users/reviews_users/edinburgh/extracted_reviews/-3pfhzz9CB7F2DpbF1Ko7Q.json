    "text": "Had dinner here in december last year, it was close to my friends apt and we just went there because we didn't want to go far. Food was nice, a bit pricey though, I had Orzo pasta, sun blushed tomato, rocket, parmesan & pine nuts, the pesto on it could've had less oil on it as I found quite greasy even for a pesto based sauce. It came with a nice salad so this was a good surprise.  We had a nice rose wine and service was alright.",

Metro is, I admit - a beautiful restaurant, modern, clean and bright. But my compliments will end there.  The meals were expensive, somewhat tasteless, tiny and my soup starter left an odd coating in my mouth for the rest of the meal. The staff were rude and unhelpful, bearly conceling thier bordom and hate for thier jobs. Service was so slow that I counted my dad checking his watch more than once with fear for missing the plane in two hours time. Not the best.  Now, I am willing to admit, we may have just been there at the wrong time or something, but still, it was an awful experience which I will not want to repeat.",

I have to say the food was excellent, the service was very good & value for money on the Sunay Lunch menu was excellent. The soup was piping hot, the Roast beef melted in the mouth! Didn't have room for puds but they looked fantastic",
