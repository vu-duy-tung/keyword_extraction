Note google maps and apple maps show the location in a close on the high side of cockburn. It is on the low side in a close. Hard to find but way worth it.",

The food was amazing, we ordered lots of pad thai and also the Krua Khun Mae noodles which were equally as delicious. The customer service was amazing, all around a very great experience and impeccable food. 10/10 would reccomend.",

This restaurant presents as very sensitive to allergies and dietary requirements, with statements on its menu speaking to the care that is taken in ingredient selection and food preparation.  I got the green curry, spicy (\"Thai spicy\" explained the waiter) and holy moly it was so good. It did not feel at all like I got a white girl version of a Thai spicy dish, it was nice and warm and balanced and delicious. My co-diners got pad Thai and a duck dish, and both were super happy with their meals. I highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "I love this place! It's cute, the waitresses are very friendly, and the food is super flavorful.  There are a few things that could be improved hence the 4 vs. 5 stars. If I could, I would give it closer to five stars. I ordered the crying tiger beef and OMG, meat was very tender and flavorful. The only thing is that it was more over than I would like so if you like your meat the right way, be vocal and tell them otherwise it will come up pretty much rare. The sauce that you can select from are hot (if you order spicy) to mild and are legit. Tons of flavor and Thai spicy level. Husband had a stir fry and it was also great. Another two pet peeves - why rice does not come with the meal you order is unusual so be prepared to pay another 2 GBP for a bowl of rice that cost virtually nothing. Also, refilling water not so often so you'll be flagging the waitress down.",

I liked that it was hidden away from the main street-- it's a total hidden gem. The employees were all very friendly. I had the pad thai, and as mentioned above, it was the best I've ever had and I'm extremely picky about my pad thai... it was so good that I came back a second time during my 3 day visit to Edinburgh.   I will absolutely be back the next time I'm in town-- I dream about this pad thai all the time! SOO GOOD!",

    "text": "Outstanding food - probably one of the best Thai meals I have had in Edinburgh, hence the 5 stars.  The restaurant is located in Old Town, in one of the closes just off Cockburn Street. Given the location, it's a bit of a hidden gem but definitely worth the visit if you're after some tasty Thai food.  They have a good selection of starters, main courses and chef's specials. Also some fusion type dishes are featured, e.g. Khua Khun Mae Special in the starters section, which is traditional Scottish haggis with Thai style seasoning. Sounds interesting, but I went for the deep fried king prawns with Thai beer batter served with a homemade mango sweet sauce. They were lovely - three large morsels with a tasty dipping sauce which wasn't too sweet.   For main course I had a duck stir fry. Again, absolutely delicious - tender and very tasty duck with vegetables. Note that they do ask you how hot you would like your food.  The waitress was very friendly and polite.",

The place is small and any group bigger than 6 will dominate the place. I'd recommend a smaller number in your dinner party 2-4 will be perfect.  As far as Thai dishes go, this has to be it. I did not have to add anything to the meal to spice it up. They have 5 level of hotness and luckily for me I chose a duck with level 4 'Hot' as that was just about right without making my eyes water (too much). Taste is IMO authentic, as far as I can tell authentic from not. Just say; very spicy and pleasingly fragrant. Service was impeccable, very attentive and unobtrusive.   I'd recommend this place to all Thai Luvvahs!",
