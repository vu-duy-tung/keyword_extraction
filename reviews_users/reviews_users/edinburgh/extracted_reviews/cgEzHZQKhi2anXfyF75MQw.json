I would always book ahead in the evening for meals but you can normally pop in and get a lunch and the menus change every day so there is normally something a bit different to tempt you.  They serve good beer, the music is really nice and the seating is again quirkily different without being too in your face. It is a nice place to pop into to get a beer and also does some really great hangover food.",

The bar staff are really friendly and all wear the fun uniform of a Hawaiian shirt. The bar is split into two parts, one exclusively for dining, and the other for drinks (and food if you wish). Finding a table when you only want a drink is difficult so arrive early, or book one of the tables on the dining side.   Drinks are pretty much standard for their price and selection, but they do have a fairly good wine list. The food is fantastic and much better than your average pub grub. It's loosely based on a tex-mex theme, but there's definitely something for everyone and at a very reasonable price.",

One half of the bar being taken up by a restaurant area and the other a seated bar area where you can still order and eat food.   The food is amazing value with massive platefuls of delicious Mexican meals being the order of the day. Drinks are reasonably prices and the friendly staff in Hawaiian shirts always raises a smile.   The bar can get real busy on a Friday or Saturday night as it fills up with pre-club goers so beware if you get there too late you may not have a seat!",

The bar has an extensive range of drinks on offer: wine, beer, spirit and cocktail drinkers are all comfortably catered for. One of the reasons why I rate this place so highly is that it's one of very few bars to have my favourite beer, Bacchus Framboise, on draught. It's a lovely Belgian fruit beer with a subtle taste of raspberries served in an ice cold glass, I can't recommended it enough! If you're feeling in the mood for tequila, ask for a 'donkey' (the bar man will know what you're on about) it comes served with a slice of orange and it's meant to be sipped and enjoyed like a malt whisky, they have been known to be knocked back as well though!  The restaurant isn't the largest of spaces and the tables are quite close together, however this just adds to the sense of intimacy. The menu comprises of a decent selection of starters/light bites and more substantial mains. Everything is freshly prepared and the food ranges from traditional pub grub with a bit of a twist (merlot and rump pie or Grolsch battered sea bass) to classic Mexican dishes like burritos and nachos. The dessert menu is quite short, but the Banoffee pie is phenomenal and they do a selection of dessert based cocktails.  Food is served from 12pm until 10.30pm, seven days a week and you can book a table via the website.",

On my latest visit I had the fish pie with boiled potatoes and salad followed by one of the best sticky toffee puddings I've ever had.   The fish pie was a very generous portion and came in at around 8.50. Packed full of salmon and topped with mashed potato, it filled a large hole and was delicious. The sticky toffee pudding was the size of a doorstop and drowned in pouring cream. YUM.   Other good bets on the menu are the burrito and steak pie. I've had the burrito and it's fab; the steak pie looks amazing too.   Highly recommended for an affordable meal, with an extensive drinks' menu to boot. Staff are decked out in Hawaiian shirts and are chatty and great for food recommendations.   There's also a bar which is frequently packed. I've only really eaten in the restaurant but it gets two thumbs up.   All in all, well worth a visit. Go go go!",

I've been a few times, sometimes for drinks and sometimes for food, and each time I do, it's because I've forgotten that I just don't really like it here.  First, the food.  It's not bad, by any tastes, but it's not brilliant.  I'm a tough judge here because it serves Mexican food and I'm a Californian who grew up on the kind of burritos you dream about when you're away from them for too long.  Ok, that's a bit of an exaggeration and kind of makes me sound like a total weirdo but the point is that I have VERY high standards for Mexican food and the Basement has never really reached them.  I do recall ordering nachos here which went down a treat and which I would definitely give another chance if I found myself back here again.  The atmosphere is what just doesn't really sit with me.  It's dark, usually quite busy which makes getting to the bar a major pain, and generally feels unwelcoming.  I think this is just not my kind of bar - it's somewhere between a pub and a bar, I think, and I'm more of a laid back pub girl.  I don't like to have to fight my way to the bar or yell above the crowds.  I imagine this place would be much better mid week or if you were sure to have a table, but it's just not anywhere I would choose to go.",

It's comforting how little it has changed in all that time: same dim, cosy atmosphere; comfort grub; good selection of drinks, and the staff still have to wear those garish aloha shirts.  Never change, Basement. I'll always love you.",

The service is really great - really friendly and chatty but also efficient. And the food was fantastic. I had a spicy pumpkin soup, which was nutty and earthy with hints of chilli and nutmeg. Really tasty. And really cheap too.  They also do cocktails and bad shirts. But we'll overlook the bad shirts because the rest of it is so great. It is a popular spot, so the restaurant tends to fill up very quickly, but it's a pretty good spot just to go for a drink.",

    "text": "Don't let the Hawaiian shirts fool you, this basement situated bar and restaurant is actually a Mexican themed establishment...I think? Well, whatever, I like the mix of banter and general good vibes you receive from this bar when you head down the stairs, and what I did approve of was that it was quite dark, but had just the right level of soft, glowing lighting, which is always flattering, and makes everyone look hot. (Note: Good for a successful date, as you don't have to worry about the horror of bright lights showing up any facial imperfections).  Anyway, I felt instantly chilled out and relaxed in here, like it was where I'd been hanging out for years, when in fact this was only the third time I'd thought of visiting The Basement in however many years of living in Edinburgh. Shame on me for being foolish and wasting my time in the same old, tired joints, because The Basement is ace. There's definitely an earthy, Aztec feel going on with the walls, quite like having a party in a cosy cave, and there's one of those neon beer bottle signs hanging up at the window, which I always approve of. There's also what looks like a couple of dentist's chairs from some kind of horror film, with a sort of steel spine that winds backwards, teamed with a table with a similar chain, tread idea going on underneath it. That was what our little group identified it as anyway, pretty much like some kind of art exhibit you can have drinks on, very cool.  Food was tasty too, my friend enjoyed his generous portion of steak and mashed potato, while I shared the simple but stomach pleasing nachos, cheese, salsa, jalapenos and sour cream dish. I'll definitely be coming back on a non-school night, when I can be more debaucherous and sample one of the tequilas or Mexican beers on offer.",

    "text": "Hidden away under the hustle and bustle of Broughton Street, another of Edinburgh's hidden treasures. It is a bar and restaurant, brilliantly retro and modern at the same time (paradoxically it works), found underground just in the nice area of Leith. The bar is a combination of traditional pub, serving a good range of beers, and then a more trendy wine bar, with some unusual cocktails being proffered.   The restaurant is great as well, but make sure you book, as it is tiny so fills up really quickly. There is tasty seafood on offer for the starters and the steaks, especially the rump are the best on the menu for the main courses. These come with a nice addition of hand cut herby chips and veg. Again for main courses the fish is also a wise choice, to be honest you won't be disappointed with much on the menu.  The prices are pretty reasonable and they do a lunch menu for 7.95. If you can get past the hideous shirts worn by the waiters then this is an often overlooked gem in the centre of town",

You'll find Mexican dishes, pub grub esque steaks, posh eatery style monkfish wrapped in bacon all served in Hawaiian shirt clad waiters.    Somehow, even amongst this incomprehensible style, the Basement manages to be somewhere you can identify and relate to: it has a particular quirky style and serves decent food to match.  The mojitos here are great too alongside an admittedly deadly Breakfast Margherita (tequila, grapefruit and marmalade)  and complement an all round enjoyable dining experience. Nothing too pricey here too, a few drinks and a tasty main course should set you back under 17.  Yet another Broughton St showpiece.",

Anyway, it really is rather large - I never would have expected this. The interior is comfortable - candles on the tables (always dangerous around me) give a lovely warm atmosphere, and the staff in their bright Hawaiian shirts really can't be missed. Well, maybeif you were blind drunk. Half of The Basement is laid out in a relaxed bar style format, and the other is set out in a more restaurant like manner. I've never yet eaten in here, but I'm sure I'll get around to it at some point. The drinks aren't too cheap, so I'm not sure how expensive the food will be by comparison however.   Outside, at the bottom of the steep flight of stairs down from the main street, there are sheltered tables, chairs and heat lamps - mostly frequented by the smokers. But for all it's outside, it really is rather toasty. Perfect for those winter months!   It's a funky, quirky bar and well worthy of a look in. But if you're feeling rather skint, then this isn't really going to be your best bet. There are definitely cheaper pubs in the area.",

    "text": "I really loved this little place, and kinda wish it was in Glasgow so I could visit more often! We only had drinks, so I can't comment on the food, but we were out exploring a part of Edinburgh we did not know that well and found this bar on Yelp (thanks Edinburgh Yelpers!).    The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, busy- but not too busy to be annoying, and had quite a buzz about it.  There were people of all ages here, from family meals to girly get togethers and mates nights out.  The decor was really cool, walls of colourful artwork on a day of the dead theme, as well as lights made from recycled Tequila bottles, and a whole wall of drinks (on the way to the toilet and by a small dining area there is a wall which is lined with bottles of the spirits which they sell, I guess it is probably meant to be functional but it looks very aesthetically pleasing and would encourage me to explore new drinks.  Their drinks list was amazing, I do not know anything about tequila and mezcal so it was cool to see the range of things which they had, and have the tasting notes.  I quite fancied the tequila taster option (flights of tequila... never seen that before, only beer or occasionally wine) but we were not out for 'big drinks', more for a nosy of a different part of Edinburgh so didn't think shots of tequila would be that wise.   We did have an interesting little soft drink shot, I wanted to get a little taste of chilli, and it did not disappoint! Apparently in Mexico people drink some palate cleaning juice between courses or even between tequilas- they have five flavours of 'amigos' to try- which come in a shot glass.  There was sadly no mango flavour left (fresh coriander, mint, jalepenos, mango juice and lime juice) but we tried the tomato one which was tomato juice, orange juice, lime juice, grenadine, cayenne and chipotle. Mmmmmm. Only 1 too!   From the ten draught beers on offer we had dark keg London Stout, which was served in branded moustached glasses.  They have 20 bottled and canned beers listed on their menu, as well as wines and soft drinks; they didn't have Jarritos (my favourite Mexican soft drink) but I can forgive them for that as it was such a lovely visit. Will definitely be back, and they have a takeaway menu too which will be great for sunny and tourist-y days or the odd day when I work in Edinburgh.  Thank you 'the Basement', you're a hidden gem.",

The food: As another reviewer mentioned about the burrito; I had one and it was nowhere near the size it used to be, you also no longer get a big dollop of sour cream on top, you no longer get the refried beans on the side or the rice. It's just a smaller burrito with a bit of salad and I think it's even more expensive.

The restaurant section is on the other side of the actual bar, so there is a very good degree of separation between the eating and drinking areas.  The bar area itself is quite spacious, with a mix of wall booths and high barstools. The cocktail list is fun and expansive, the prices reasonable (around 8 each). Really, really nice vibe in here.

    "text": "Excellent Mexican restaurant based in Broughton Street, right in the heart of Edinburgh city centre. An original decor and joyful vibes is what you can definitely expect when going to have dinner to this exotic place. While drinking one of their sweet and fruity cocktails, you'll immediately feel like being on a dreamy island under the warm Mexican sun, far away from stress, problems and the Scottish rain. Prices are average but portions are very abundant and ingredients absolutely fresh, so write it down on your restaurant bucket list, especially if you are a big fan of tender stakes and smoky meat!",

I'd certainly head back on one of our many trips to Edinburgh.",

Soft music enhanced the experience. The menu gave a nice set of options without being too much. Quality of the food was very good; having the freshly made guacamole at our table as an appetizer.

I'm a sucker for tex-mex food, for starters, and the fact that they sell alcohol too is just an added bonus. This place reminds me of Under The Stairs on the edge of the Grassmarket, but with a more latino feel to it.  That said, the food here isn't cheap. As cool as this underground bar-eaterie may be, if I'm going to pay just under 10 for a main course I could go to loads of other more upmarket places; for a gatropub-style basement place it does seem a little steep. But, there's always a really nice relaxed atmosphere to this place, thanks to its largely twentysomething clientele, and that's something that you can't guarantee in a lot of other places.  Prices aside, I love this place.",

    "text": "I used to go to this place all the time, and recently went back after about nine months - they've remodeled the place and completely changed the menu, so this was a first trip to the new-and-improved Basement.  The short version is that the new interior is fab, but the food is just ok.  The longer version: The place is comfortable, more colourful and brightly-lit than it used to be, and the service is amazing. There's some beautiful Mexican art throughout the place, and the updated bar, restaurant area, and even restrooms all look fantastic. The menu looked amazing, and they even have table-side guacamole (they prepare it at your table to your specifications), which I haven't seen anywhere in the UK before.  Unfortunately, the quality of the food isn't great. The burrito is very dry, the fish tacos don't seem much like tacos (wiry salad and cucumbers? since when is this what a taco is made up of?), the 'small bites' are a bit bland (we got the crayfish mini tacos, and there was so little crayfish and so much guacamole and raw onion that I couldn't taste the crayfish at all), and even with the table-side preparation, the guacamole was meh (though the avocados were fresh and of good quality, which is hard enough to come by!).  To be fair, I'm from Southern CA, so my Mexican food standards are probably unreasonably high, but in future I'd probably only go to the Basement for drinks (their cocktail and liquor menus are very impressive!).",

Smaller portion than expected, same with the tacos but for me I liked the smaller portion size. I then ordered the fish tacos which had a bit of a kick so I had to ask for water as well. Fresh taste though and nice presentation. I'm also just a sucker for Mexican food though.",

    "text": "What an absolute treat that turned out to be. It's no secret that I'm a fan of Tex-Mex, as is Paul, and this is what had drawn him to the restaurant in the first place, that and, \"it looked cool.\" To be fair, it certainly does. It's a half-floor down and has a very funky feel to it, it's warm, vibrant and fun.  They seem to be aiming for flexibility. While their menu is clearly laid out in the standard way, with nibbles, starters, mains and desserts, it also highlights that the dishes are shareable. They're not starters, they're \"small plates.\" The \"large plates\" are also, \"perfect for sharing.\" If you wanted to, you could just order a selection of food for the table and then mix and match.  We opted to share our starters and to order individual mains (although I've never yet eaten in a restaurant with P and not asked if he wants to taste what I've ordered and vice-versa). We went with the chicken croquetas and the duck taquitos. Then I got the fish tacos and P chose the pork burrito.  The duck taquitos were great but I loved the croquetas even more. They were golden, crispy and fluffy with gooey chickeny cheesy stuff that flowed out from the middle when you cut them open. Both dishes were served with a dip, both had a fair pinch of spice and a smattering of side salad and both made me wonder if we really might have been better off getting a selection of tapas style dishes from the small plates menu.  Until my main arrived. Battered white fish, crisp, fresh thinly sliced salad and chilis, hot sauce, some kind of spiced sour cream, soft silky tacos. So. Much. Delicious. Food. The spice crept up on me. I wasn't fully aware of it until my lips were stinging and by then it was too late. Everything was exactly what I want Tex-Mex to be.  Conversely, P's burrito looked a bit bland. He said it was good, but it didn't come with guacamole or sour cream (which made him happy because he's weird) or salsa (which made him unhappy because even he isn't that weird). The result just looked a bit plain and quite dry, but he said the fillings that were there were good, just that he'd request salsa next time.  I so, so nearly left it there. Technically, I was full. But they had churros and I think the last time I ate churros was in 2013. It's ok, I know where to get churros if I really want them, it's just that I've either been distracted, full or avoiding the extra calories every other time for the last four years. I crumbled. I have literally not one single regret about this. They were softcrunchysweetcinnamondelicious and the chocolate and chilli dipping sauce was amazing. I would literally go back to The Basement just to eat churros. I had forgotten how good they could be.",

Not until after we tried to get in through the wrong door of course (it's the furthest to the left by the way).  We were promptly seated and the staff were great. Not overbearing, but helpful enough and recommended a few dishes for us to try. We'd also read a few reviews recommending the guac, so ordered that first. I loved the fact that the guacamole was made right in front of us, and the waitress asked which ingredients we wanted. Obviously we had the lot, and although the guacamole was certainly fresh, it wasn't anything special like I thought it'd be. I'm not sure how though, as we physically saw her put the spices in it, that should make it great?! Weird.  We Then moved onto a selection of tacos and small plates for us to share. We had shredded duck, cod cheek, steak tacos and then the ribs. Again, the food was good. Not great, but we scoffed the lot without there being any problem.   This all equated to a usual 4 star review. So why the 3 stars? The main reason is because of the price. With small tacos priced at 6.50 for 2, the bill was over 40 including 1 drink each. This meant that it was about the same price as an El Cartel and unfortunately the quality was nowhere near.",

I've been here for two years and this is the first and only good Mexican I've had.   Margarita is fantastic, had it on the rocks. I only wish it was larger!  Definitely order the guacamole, they make it right in front of you. You can opt to leave out any ingredients you don't want. Avocados were so fresh!  I ordered two small dishes, the ceviche tostada and the special, a butternut squash Crustada. The ceviche was amazing and I don't even really go for ceviche normally. It had a light citrus dressing. Highly recommend for the foodie in the mood for Mexican!",

So I can only comment on it as being a bar.   This is what I would call a hipster bar. Cool, dark and with a trendy crowd. They had ten interesting craft beers on tap and loads of bottles as well. I could have spent a good while drinking my way through the various  options on offer.   Cool modern place doing good beer and I would definitely recommend going for a drink and I will hopefully be back to at some point.",

    "text": "We enjoyed a fantastic Mexican meal here after reserving a table via Yelp and Open Table. Reservations are recommended as the place gets very, very busy and tables are at a premium.   The restaurant bar is downstairs in a very relaxed atmosphere with tables and small and cosy dining booths that you share with other groups of people.   The service was fantastic, with the staff making fresh Guacamole at your table, and the food and drink was top notch. I had the Chicken Enchilada, which was some of the best Mexican food I've ever had!   There is a decent range of tasty cocktails too.  Great venue, Good food, good service. Highly recommended - but remember to reserve a table!",

It almost seems like every part of the basement is a piece of art, the food, the cocktails, the furniture & the actual paintings. Furthermore the waiters do a great job making you feel at home and taking care of you even when the place is buzzing.",

    "text": "I love this innovative Mexican restaurant. Nothing I tried was run of the mill. The guacamole is made at your table. A variety of ingredients to add to the guac are brought to the table and you choose one or all. The results were great - I just added a bit of table salt. The chicken in the fajitas was perfectly cooked - nicely seasoned, tender and cooked to a perfect temperature. The homemade hot sauces were a perfect topping. I had a chocolate and chili brownie with a scoop of surprisingly delicious and complimenting house made avocado ice cream. The chili was just a touch that brought out the chocolate flavor in the soft, wonderful brownie. The candied, strips of hot pepper garnish was so good, I could have eaten a bowl of them! The homemade limoncello and tonic was a terrific addition! I highly recommend a visit - make reservations as it is quite small.",

It's much lighter and brighter than it was before, and nice warm place to hide away on a rainy afternoon!  It serves Mexican food, it's a fairly small menu, but has pretty much everything you'd imagine.  I had a chicken burrito with green rice (still no idea what green rice is and how it differs from regular rice), it was yummy. Large portion size, I managed to finish it, but only just! The prices were pretty reasonable, and now I'm wondering why I hadn't been for 5 years!",
