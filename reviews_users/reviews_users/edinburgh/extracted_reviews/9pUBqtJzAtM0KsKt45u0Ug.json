That'll get you off right. Eat here.   This is not top supafly food. This is simple,honest food, just what you want at breakfast. And cheap. mmm. Cheap.",

    "text": "Came here for breakfast and got soup which had a large amount of pepper in it, which made the broth almost crunchy....overlooking that, the potatoes and leaks in it were great and perfectly cooked. My friend got a sandwich with a fried potato (or something of that nature) in it and she said it was good as well--but a lot smaller than we thought it was going to be.",

    "text": "Snax has become a bit of an Edinburgh institution, with branches springing up all over the city.  It's easy to see why it's so popular, as it combines the straightforward menu and unbeatable prices of a typical greasy spoon joint with the ambiance of a more arty and stylish cafe.  Unlike the one on Buccleuch Street, the Duke Street manifestation of Snax is not filled with hungover students, but rather hungover working men, appeasing their pounding heads with bacon butties, cheese toasties, and other traditional fatty foodstuffs.  It's pretty small inside, but clean and light with brisk, uniformed staff, a dependable place to replenish your energy after a night of mayhem.",
