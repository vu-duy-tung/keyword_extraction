    "text": "I came back and had to try the steaks, after watching them go by last time I was in. Coll, my affable host for the evening suggested I try the blue cheese rump steak, and boy am I glad I did. I'm normally not one for long reviews, but in this case it's merited  :) It has to be one of the best steaks I have had in Edinburgh, and almost matching up to Black and Blue in Vancouver (a compliment I would toss out lightly), I just managed to resist the urge to lick the plate to get the last of the rich blue cheese sauce.  Totally worth checking out next time you have the urge to eat steak :)  Was out and about looking for somewhere to check out for dinner, and Yelp suggested dropping in here. Very glad I did :) Burger deliciousness, they are giving Bread Meats Bread and Burger Meats Bun a run for their money. They recently renovated I was told. Very nice, friendly service, and a great burger, will have to stop back to check out the steaks I saw going by :)",

    "text": "Went here with friends on Thursday evening on a corporate retreat. We were scouting for a venue to host a larger gathering in a few weeks. Thought maybe Buffalo would be perfect.   What an experience we had! The issue was with the older male host. He was a complete prick to me and my friends. We are a quiet and polite group of 6 adults. We didn't have a reservation because it was a 4:30p and there were tons of empty tables (now I know why) but they wouldn't even seat us! He ushered us out of that restaurant like we're we homeless asking people for money. Completely disrespectful.   We took our business else where and I have told everyone on the retreat what happened to us at Buffalo and it's almost like a running joke now. No one will go there. So I guess some good came out of it.",

Now though, the place looks fantastic with a relaxed Southwestern vibe, some quirky accessories and enough cool grey paint to keep the whole thing from feeling too kitsch.  We ate the ribs and wings to start which were great (particularly the wings - perfectly chargrilled) and then both had the Boss Hog burger as our main, myself on a chicken fillet, my partner on a traditional beef burger. Both were great - well cooked and with just the right amount of juiciness.  The service we received was attentive without being overbearing - no mean feat as the restaurant was deserted when we first arrived.  Overall a great experience, and it's definitely worth checking out if you're in the area!",

The restaurant was recently remodeled which was nice because it matched the vibe of the food and felt clean and comfortable.",

The owner made sure we were out in plenty of time to make our festival show, and all of the staff were really helpful and kind. I would definitely go back. Looking forward to trying a burger next time.",
