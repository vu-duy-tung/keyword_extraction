    "text": "The food was delicious, except the chips/fries were plain. I didn't see the bill, and I was a bit sick when I was there so I wasn't really looking at prices but more for something that wasn't too greasy so that I would vomit. Therefore, I can't comment on the prices.  My issue is that the waitress was very rude. She treated us as if we were beneath her with her voice and body-language, gave my mother a bunch of attitude when she was just trying to clarify whether or not they serve shellfish (because she has a severe allergy that could kill her), she never checked on us, never brought the tea I had ordered, and she didn't acknowledge us as we departed.  La comida era deliciosa, menos las papas fritas no tenian sabor. No vi la factura, y estaba un poco enferma cuando estaba alli, asi que no estaba mirando los precios, sino mas bien por algo que no era demasiado graso. Por lo tanto, no puedo comentar sobre los precios. Mi problema es que la camarera fue muy desagradable. Ella nos trato como si estuvieramos debajo de ella con su voz y su forma de ser, le dio a mi madre un monton de actitud cuando solo estaba tratando de aclarar si servian mariscos (porque tiene una alergia severa que podria matarla), nunca nos miro, nunca trajo el te que habia pedido, y no nos saludo cuando nos despedimos.",

    "text": "There's a sign on the front window that says \"kid friendly.\" Let's start with just plain friendly.  I seldom argue or confront staff at restaurants, but the waitress was rude, impudent, socially inept and arrogant beyond belief. She didn't 'get' that my son has a dairy and egg allergy, and recommended scrambled eggs. She didn't accept that oats can and have been made with water, but went on to question 'are you a chef?' She decided to elaborate that 'in Scotland, oats are made with milk.' Overall, she suggested that my son could only have fruit or ham.  Let me clarify: Oats can be made with water - I do it and it's delicious with fruit She wasn't a chef nor a Scottish 'lass' to remark as she did  We packed up and left...I told her that she was inappropriate very frankly and to her face. Her response was simply 'that's fine.'  I hate to sound like an elitist, but differences in etiquette, manners and general politeness probably had something to do with the Brexit voters coming out en masse.",
