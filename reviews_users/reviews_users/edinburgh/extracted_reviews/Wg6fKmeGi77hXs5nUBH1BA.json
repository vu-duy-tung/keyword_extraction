I won't harp on about the surprising fact that the younger staff seemed to know nothing about whisky, which is obviously an important part of this traditional freehouse's stock. I can't comment on the owner as I don't think he was there. I love this place, its history, community and values, and was excited about taking my friend who was visiting town. I have also myself worked in hospitality for many years. So we were surprised, at the end of a pleasant quiet evening, to be very rudely bawled at by the female Polish bar manager (or senior bar staff member) who told us, with absolutely no precursor to 'get out, we're closed now.' Obviously nobody has told this person about calling time  there was no warning, and we'd long finished our drinks at any rate. Nor was it just me and my friend  she shouted at all the remaining customers. It wasn't just poor customer service  it was very personally rude. She stood and glared at us like a sour old harpy as we left and it really spoiled the evening. I hope she isn't there next time I come back.",

We ordered a Malibu and lemonade and a pint of Best which came to 7.40 which is quite expensive compared to places in town as the average price of Best is around 1.95!   However, the atmosphere (note: we didn't have any trouble with the bar staff but i wouldn't say they were the most welcoming) and surroundings made up for it, a nice quiet relaxing pub to have a drink, the pub is rather eccentricly decorated, with instruments, model planes, a big model boat(!) and all sorts of things on the walls and ceiling. My boyfriend said he could spend all day looking around and we both really enjoyed it.   I would say it was a lovely pub with a quiet atmosphere to have a drink, it is a little pricey though.",

    "text": "Well it's changed days here in morningside. For those that remember the 'mans' as a semi biker pub full of under 30's listening to good music above the rattle and chime of pinball machines, and the occasional 'exotic' dancer, you're in for a shock! The 21st C canny mans is very gentrified - aimed firmly at dragging the local middle classes away from their PCs/TVs. The pub caters for the 40s and over....look out for some serious 'mutton dressed as lamb' which is an almost permanent fixture around the main bar. It's got to be worth a visit to check out the decor and the interesting layout of the place (see other review on yelp). We always bring friends from out of town to have a look...it's big on visuals but low on atmosphere these days. Is it possible that the mgt have managed to add fun to the long list of things they ban in their pub?  Good range of drinks, especially if you are a whisky fan, often served with a wee snack on the side. Decent range of beer too which seems to be well looked after. You are talking 'town' prices here too - guess that's the price for the venue! Added bonus in summer is the small beer garden, you could easily lose a day in there soaking up the sun and several G&Ts. In summary the canny mans is definitely worth a visit but you will want to go elsewhere for a bit more fun and atmosphere!",

The whole place has weird and unusual things hanging from the ceiling and on the walls, ranging from wax models, to bits of car - you certainly wouldn't be lacking in a subject for discussion, that's for sure! This used to be a working man's pub, in fact many moons ago women were not allowed in at all! It used to be termed as a traditional 'spit and sawdust' bar but I haven't seen sawdust on the floor for many years, and I suspect if you spit, you'll be tossed out! It's become quite expensive and there is a clique of regulars who can, if they so desire, make you feel rather uncomfortable as an outsider, with simply a look. Still, you must visit this pub at least once, just to say you've been!",

    "text": "\"No phones, no cameras, no backpackers\" reads the sign that greets you to Canny Mans, also known as the Volunteer's Arms. The inside of the pub is more welcoming though: every wall is decorated with random memorabilia, giving the place a relaxingly cluttered, homely feel. There are huge champagne magnums, instruments, hanging skis and a boxed weasel all in no apparent order. My personal favourite spot is 'the Churchill Corner' where you can toast the big man as you sit beside his small shrine. It's a surreal but warming experience. In terms of drink, expect to spend over 3 a pint. This is the price you pay for the antique bar, the wide selection of spirits and the unique atmosphere. The staff are famous for being aloof, even rude, but I've never seen it. And that seems to be the thing with Canny Man's: you either subscribe to its bonkers personality or sit in the corner tutting about Morningside prices. Go see, find out for yourself.",

The plaque outside 'No mobile phones' 'No Backpackers' etc .. The bar is fantastic, with every malt whisky you could dream of. In fact, looking at the bar, you could probably order anything! The place is riddled with stuffed animals and many, many antiques. The memorabilia is breathtaking. There's even a corner of the pub devoted to Winston Churchill. There are very strict rules in here, and the staff seem friendly enough, but I reckon any messing about, severe drunkenness, or wearing the wrong, or scruffy, clothes - and you'll be out on your ear. If you do not suffer from severe paranoia, and can handle the looks the locals - and bar staff - initially give you, then it's worth a visit .. What a unique, and very interesting place ..",

Ostensibly a small place, it has two bars and serves up quirkiness in doses throughout the labyrinth of rooms bedecked in crazy bric-a-brac - from stuffed animals to colonial clocks on the walls, to a model naval vessel and female mannequin dressed in black hanging from the ceiling ...

It means that the onslaught of tourists that a place that this must usually attack with vigour, flashing snaps of the ceiling and requesting gluten free beers at the bar, are nowhere to be seen.   The bar is full of True Scots, proper locals and the odd tourist (me and the boyfriend). It serves a huge range of whiskeys, a lovely selection of wines and some of the best bloody Mary's I've ever had. The antiques hanging from the ceiling, and taxidermy on the walls tells stories that you want to listen to, and the fact that the pub has been handed down 5 generations is obvious and in your face, which I love.   It would be a 5 star in my opinion if there was a little less fear in the air (from me and the staff), but you know what, sometimes it's important to stop taking photos of your life, and live it instead.",

My boyfriend and I walked in but no one really acknowledged us.  i walked in a little further and a woman approached us and asked for drinks or food.

We said it was our first time at the place and she explained they didn't serve pub food and walked away after taking our drink orders and leaving menus.  The couple next to us, leaned in and made suggestions of what to order.  I ended up ordering the same meal she had and it was really delicious.  It was an open face sandwich and a hot potato on the side.    After dinner, I asked the manager if it would be okay if I took some pictures and she said yes.

    "text": "The Canny Man's is a sure contender for the title of Unfriendliest Pub even now, despite the passing of its infamously grumpy landlord. But the frosty reception and the air of tresspassing are all part of the theatre of this unique little boozer. The onslaught on your confidence starts outside, where a sign reads: \"no mobiles, no credit cards, no backpackers, no cameras...\" Inside, an intimidating land lady (I think) guards the door as you enter and glares. Dare to wander in? You will need to survive the withering look that follows you around the room. Take a seat and ask for the menu and you will have a white line cloth and proper napkins set up which is very nice. If you manage to understand the ordering system (write some code on paper, not the name of the dish... THE CODE and don't for god's sake try to talk to the waitress), you're in. And it is worth it! My favourite of the hundred options is the surf and turf open sandwich though the food is all a bit pricey as is the wine actually it is good for a change. Inside, The Canny Man's is like a curio shop alongside the traditional mandolins and dusty jeroboams pinned to the walls are military uniforms, paintings, swords, prams and a boat. Then you look up: a shop mannequin is skewered to the ceiling, dressed as a witch and many other sinister faces are peering at you from paintings are everywhere. The whisky selection is extensive and reasonably priced and they usually do a free buffet weeknights as well as giving a little nibble to enjoy with your drink. It is our local but despite being regulars I don't think we are very welcome but hey!",

    "text": "I don't believe the owner of this place wants any customers, he seems to hate everyone. As you will immediately notice when you walk in there is a sign saying effectively 'NOTHING ALLOWED'. No cameras (I don't know why this is an issue, how many people take places of the interior of pubs, apart from Yelp reviewers), no mobile phones (I can sort of understand but a bit impractical), scruffy people (I understand the thinking behind this but there is a very vague definition of what scruffy is, my friend was turned away because he had piercings). As well as this the manager hates students, which is his prerogative, but the bar is quite far down Morningside road and cannot be frequented by too many students.   Once you are inside, you just can't help escaping the feeling that you are not wanted there. Unusually this does not come from the regulars, who are all friendly enough, but from the bar staff and especially the  manager. The drinks are all good enough, there is a good selection of lagers, ales and spirits, and they are not too pricey, but I don't want to drink in a pub where you can feel dislike and tension always smouldering under the surface.",

    "text": "I'm updating my review based on a few new experiences here.  First of all, how did I manage to miss all of the extra nooks and crannies in this place?  It's actually much larger (though by no means large) than it first comes across and even has a pretty cool looking beer garden for those 5 days a year when it doesn't rain.  My primary purpose for my update is - the buffet.  Has anyone else been here when they've had the buffet on?  Do they do it every day or just maybe Thursday through Sunday?  Or, is it completely random and my empty belly just got really really really lucky yesterday?  It's free.  It's good.  It has things like chicken wings, roast potatoes, mini sausages and fancy sandwiches.  It's free.  It's free and it's the kind of stuff that most pubs would be charging at least 5/head for.    My tight Glaswegian was so impressed and felt bad that we had only come in for one pint each, so he left a tip.  That's how good it was.    Beyond this, what I love about the Canny Man is the fact that you can come here on a Thursday and the place is packed.  It's packed with the kind of people who are in for pints with friends, and the kind of people who are in for champagne with friends.    This place is basically legend... (wait for it).. -ary.",

    "text": "It is like other review's have suggested. I did have a bit of a 'wow' moment when I entered and first impressions were I liked its character. It does have a long list though of 'don't...' so this might put people off and several work colleagues confirmed, that at least in the past, if they didn't like your face then you didn't get in.  My single experience here is you don't get service with a smile. Border line rude actually to a colleague who is a regular which was a tad off putting and made me re-think my hastly thought plan of bringing my parents here on NY day. The wine is lovely (pretty classy actually) and they have a great selection of whiskies. The place is full of character and the little booth area at the back was perfect for our post work, post dinner drinks. It also meant we could be separate, jolly and not run the risk of being evicted for breaking the 'don't' rules when trying to phone a drunking colleague last seen in the middle of Morningside Road who hadn't made it to the pub.  So, I would go back, though probably not with guests as such, and it looks like it does great food so that would be worth investigating. So we'll see.  Note - DOESN'T accept credit cards, bank cards, etc but there is an ATM across the road!",

    "text": "Canny Man's has some wierd paranoia about anybody coming in who is potentially threatening, dirty or has a knack for taking photos.  Most places will let just about anybody in and then ask those unwelcome to leave, but Canny Man's is, apparantly, not most places.  I was kind of bewildered as to what their disconcerting sign was all about, as it's not particularly posh inside.   In fact, I thought it was kind of boring.  It's just a standard pub with nice decor, reasonably priced drinks, unfriendly staff and no TV screens.  This is certainly not the place to come and get rowdy over a heavy session, but if you're after a chilled out drink in the afternoon or evening, this could be the place.",

I had already been instructed to go in the side door, as the locals go in this way and not through the front. A bell rang as I opened the door, just what I always wanted, something to herald my arrival and draw attention to moi! :/ I got my drink and found a nice corner to settle into to have a good nosey around the bar. There's so much to see. Lots of quirky items hung about the place. I especially liked the portrait of a westie's head on top of some military outfit. They provided table service and the waiter already had change with him when e took money from us, so there was no going back and forth, very slick! I want to go back very soon to have another look.",

From the brass plaque outside banning cameras, mobile phones and backpackers to the too-bright rooms with tacky 80s furniture, by way of the 50-something clientele in expensive jumpers - I think maybe it's just not for me.   And I'm sure it used to be much more atmospheric, with low lighting and serious dust everywhere - I think they had to clean up the dust for fire reasons, or something? But I'm sure they could have preserved the old ambiance.   On the up side, it does sell good beer! For a price.",

Maybe it was the big signs saying 'no phones, no cameras' - it may as well have said 'no customers' - or maybe it was the disgruntled barman 'we're not serving food' . Whichever, I didn't feel welcomed.  I got the impression that it's very much a local pub, the same people come here all the time and everyone knows everyone and their son Jock.

Oh and no cell phones either.   Now before you turn around and leave this rather rude welcoming, please take a good look around- you are in for a rather pleasant surprise. (and find the no screens rule quite liberating- have a proper chat rather than get hypnotised by a TV screen!)   There are a variety of room to choose from to enjoy your pint of ale and all with their own individual style and serving good food (ciabattas are quite tasty). The waitress matches the entrance signs- very rude and moody but still I am giving it 4 stars not for its service more for the ambiance of the place which to be fair is quite cool.  I'm not bothered with the slightly older age group this pub is gearing to, it's sometimes nice to get away from the student dominated places every once and awhile.",

The sign outside lists six or seven types of people who will not be allowed to enter the bar. Backpackers, people wearing trainers, people holding cameras, people wearing football colours...the list goes on!   This kind of attitude is enough to put you off visiting to Canny Man's but really- it is worth persevering! The interior of the Canny Man's is phenomenal, each room has a different theme but not in a tacky Disney kind of way. The music room is wallpapered in aged music sheets and covered in beautiful old instruments. The time room is covered in clocks with a few nods to Alice in Wonderland here and there. Apparently the management kicked off (how surprising) at health and safety when they were made to dust the walls of this old building because the matted spider webs added so much character. I heard they have resorted to spray cobwebs to get the same effect. Whatever it takes for the Canny Man's staff to be happy, you can't fault them for style.   I would thoroughly recommend the Canny Man's to anyone looking for a private room for a special night. You have to phone ahead to book but you get fussed about all the more. Order champagne and a bowl of strawberries arrives too. Round after round of nibbles also helps to sober you up. Well worth smartening up your act for!",

I'm not sure if my friends and I match whatever ideal client they are looking for, but after 6 or so visits, and despite the conspicuous 'No Backpackers' sign at the front door, I have never witnessed any such bad behavior from the staff. This is funny, as I and my guests have been backpackers; perhaps the fact that we were clean and groomed allowed us special permission to be served at this historic establishment.   I like this pub because it's so quirkythere is so much random stuff tacked all over the walls that it's entertaining just looking around. Also, the Canny Man's may have the best selection of single malts of any place I've been.   I can't comment on the food, as I have never sampled anything on the menu, but I can say that this is a cool, locals-only spot to take visiting friends for a unique pub experience.",

In fact, I'd go so far as to say that The Canny Man's is the \"mad old aunt\" of Edinburgh pubs! You find her slightly peculiar, frustrating at times, but you just can't help but love the old biddy. It's SO Morningside.   This pub's unique atmosphere really has to be experienced first-hand! As long as you go with an open mind then you'll have a great time. It can seem quite stuffy l as you step through the front door to be greeted by many a notice of rules... but at least you know where you stand!   Drinks are averagely priced and there is a good selection. They do delicious sandwiches at lunch time and you can munch away whilst admiring the many ornaments, bits of bric a brac and the odd tat dangling from the ceiling!

It doesn't warrant its pretences but,in truth, its all forgiven by the fact it's one of the most unique pubs in Edinburgh- probably Scotland in fact. An eccentric mix of traditional pictures, wax models and war memorabilia adorn the wall to make it one of the most strangely furbished pubs i've ever seen   The whisky collection, and the array of champagne magnums, is astounding. The barman always gives you side snacks with every pint and there are no photographs or, supposedly, mobile phones allowed.   Still, nobody really takes much notice so i recommend you go and have a laugh there.",
