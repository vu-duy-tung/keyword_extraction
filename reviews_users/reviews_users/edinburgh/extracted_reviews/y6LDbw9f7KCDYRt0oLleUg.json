    "text": "Great fish and chips prepared to order. Fish was a very nice portion for the money. Nice beer selection as well. Mostly a carry out place, there are some seats by the window. Open late if you have the munchies. Plenty of other eat options available as well but we chose the fish. All very happy we did",
