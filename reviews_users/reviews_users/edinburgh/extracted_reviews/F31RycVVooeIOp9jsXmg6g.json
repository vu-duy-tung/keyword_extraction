    "text": "My friends had been raving about the breakfasts at The Bluebird for months - so finally I was in the city early enough to go and check it out.  Everything about the place was just lovely. From the cosy space of the cafe itself to the friendly staff - it really lived up to its great reputation.  I went straight for the stack of buttermilk pancakes, bacon and maple syrup and was not disappointed. The pancakes were fluffy and sweet, the bacon crispy and smokey. I promptly smothered it all in the maple syrup and happily inhaled the lot.  The only thing that was wrong was that I was too full to eat the sourdough toast I had also ordered.   Next time for sure.",

Everything is house made from the scones, soups and delicious meatloaf. Rory and Fergus gave us their best Scottish hospitality while we dined, luggage in tow, whilst waiting to check in our Air BnB flat directly above. My husband enjoyed the pancakes, I was lucky to have a taste, and I have to say they might have been the best pancakes I have personally ever tasted. I had a freshly baked scone cinnamon walnut scone and a delicious Americana. I went down later to take out the meatloaf sandwich and it was wonderful. Thank you to Rory & Fergus for making our morning comfortable and delicious!",

Everything was made to order and the ingredients were fresh and delicious. The ladies working there were also so friendly and welcoming and we felt right at home. We had to walk for about 20 minutes from our hotel to get here and it was worth every step!! I would highly recommend this place for breakfast or lunch, but keep in mind that their sitting room is small if you're wanting to bring a big group. I plan to come again the next time we're in Scotland.",

This lovely spot seemed like a somewhat hidden gem that all of the locals line up for around lunchtime. The staff is friendly and the interior is bright and welcoming. Try something new, Scottish, or a twist on American lunch items. The coffee is from a great little place around the corner, Artisan. Definitely suggest you try this place for a comforting collaboration of food styles.",

We chatted as she made our food for takeaway and we bonded over us having lived in Knoxville, Tennessee for a few years and her favorite band being from that area! Super cute place and we will be definitely coming back to try some more of her wonderful food on future visits!

I got my wife and I two large cappuccino's that were delicious, a breakfast sandwich with a fried egg, bacon, and haggis, and fresh baked cheddar croissant . The breakfast roll was light and fluffy, and very tasty. The fried egg was cooked perfect with the egg yolk runny and bacon was crispy, but not burnt. My wife's cheddar fresh morning baked croissant was very tasty with a nice sharp cheddar taste all the way through. Perfect way to start a Sunday morning!",

Having not really sampled pulled jackfruit before (maybe once at a potluck) and the only place I knew of offering it was one of Glasgow's vegan places,  I was keen to try it.   I'm not really sure what the texture is meant to be like -  soft or chewy. I had it with jalapenos, avocado,  and vegan cheese (Violife) on a bed of nachos,  so I just scooped it all up and inhaled. It wasn't chewy,  but having not eaten pork for over 20 years,  a replacement wasn't really something I was looking out for. Is pulled pork chewy? I have no idea. It was delicious anyway.   Service was great and the server said they're looking at making some changes to the menu - which may include vegan pancakes. Will be looking out to see if that options makes the cut!  You can sit in or takeaway.",

You were right, my friend.  Dinky as a daisy and blue as a cornflower, I can criticise this little joy in one way only - that it isn't nearer to my house. Their \"soup and half sandwich\" deal for 4.95 is pretty breath-taking - if that's HALF a sandwich, I don't wanna see a full one! You can choose the bread type for your butty as well - I went with a tiger baguette filled with chilli chicken mayo and yippity-yum was I glad that I did. Good hearty soup to go with it, too, oh yes indeedy. That, along with a generous pot of tea, hit the spot for 7.15, which I reckon is pretty darned good going.  They also, as Blythe and Julie both mentioned, do Tennessee buttermilk pancakes (ZZZZZIP) so I will be back ere long to have a chompy brekkist here as well.  The menu is presented on a clipboard and the wall is adorned with the simple but rather effective conceit of spelling the name of the cafe in large letters, each printed on A4, popped on a clipboard and stuck to the wall. The only other piece of decoration on the wall is an adorable poster for the cafe's Tennessee namesake, the famous acoustic music club.  Disclosure: I have never been the kind of person who has a yen to travel. Tennessee, however, is one of the only places in the world I have ever actually wanted to go to. And now I feel like I can trot on down there for pancakes any day of the week.",

I sampled very good soup, from a daily selection of four varieties, and quite a good hotdog. Their breakfast menu looks intriguing, with Tennessee buttermilk pancakes on offer. It might be a good spot for a Yelpy brunch visit, but given it's rather small there'd only be room for around ten people, I reckon.  Overall, we said: \"the Bluebird Cafe looks to be starting from a very promising position. They have some kinks to iron out, and some menu typos to correct, but I think they have a strong chance of developing into a real local favourite. It's a place that's well worthy of a visit, I'd say.\"",
