The menu is eclectic and everything we tried was well made and tasty. The simply decor and the atmospheric music playing at a low enough level not to harass, was an added bonus.

I was surprised how happy I was leaving this place, because I walked in tired and hungry and it could have gone either way. But nope it went so well! This is a must eat in Edinburgh.",

All three of us ended up getting a bento, mine was katsu curry with gyoza. The food was pretty good, came out quickly and was hot! I love Japanese curry a lot and the curry at Koyama met my standards. The katsu was pretty big and nice and crispy. I loved the gyoza. Overall not a bad place to get a reasonably priced, tasty dinner.",

As a local I'd really rather not pay more during one month of the year just so tourists can have extra cash rung out of them but as Koyama deploy their Festival menu during August that is what happens (don't expect any soup other than miso however as the overheads on that don't justify a price increase / it's too hard to make in August  you decide). Food-wise certainly no complaints but the staff all succumbed to blindness when it came to having us pay the bill, despite having brought it down to us. We weren't the only table to experience this so I'd hazard a guess that it occurs regularly. A disappointment overall that overshadows the good work being done in the kitchen.",

The servers were nice enough to let us and a few other people order and get our food before the kitchen closed, and we were welcome to stay as long as we liked. They even came by again right before he kitchen closed to make sure we didn't want to order more food before they closed.  We had two rolls. Unfortunately I remember the names... One roll had tempura king prawn and it was very good!! My only complaint was the pieces were SO big. They definitely should have been sliced in half for a more enjoyable meal. The second roll we got was tempura fried. The fish was NASTY. It tasted like an aquarium! When I pulled it out, it was black and gross. The cooks had already left so I didn't bother complaining to the waitress, because what good is that going to do for anyone?  We also got a king prawn noodle bowl. It was really good, except that it was 20% noodles and 80% bean sprouts. We realized this after we ate all the noodles and the bowl was still well over half full. It was just bean sprouts! What a waste. It would have been good if not for that. I kind of like more than two bites of noodles!  Service was great, hence the only reason I gave them three stars. If not for the service and the one good sushi roll, I would have given them 1 star for that nasty roll of sushi!!",

It's changed too, since my last few visits, and worthy of an update. Still, some of it rings True - the special rolls are huge, and the miso soup is still some of the best I have had here, but it looks like the restaurant has stepped it's game up in it's presentation.   Fresh on the table (for 8) were wasabi peas, crackers and still-warm fried vegetable (sushi) rolls, and miso soup delivered when we were still trying to pick. Not sure if what you get will depend on the size of table - sometimes a group helps!   Sushi was beautifully presented, much more ornate than I remembered from previous trips. I had the Salmon Hokkaido roll, a spicy salmon roll which was full of flavour. Tiger and Cod was a bit more disappointing, a panko coated cod roll topped with mango sounded like it should be insanely tasty, but the mango was flavourless as was the cod, so a little more disappointing. Miso aubergine was a little soggy but enjoyable and overall, a good meal. Will I continue to visit? Yes, most definitely.",

We also tried a beef kimchi hot plate with mushrooms and rice. We like our Korean food so this was pretty good..  Not too salty or to sweet.  Most disappointing was the salmon hokkaido roll,  which we didn't realise came seared/half-cooked.  The whole point is Raw fish and this cooked salmon was tasteless.  The service was ok- their thing was off in asking if we needed anything because more often than not we had to try to get their attention -  so they could be more attentive -  at one point we needed something and all 3 waitresses were focused on one table!  On the plus side, there a nice variety of rolls here and the sushi chef was very speedy in getting the orders out!  Hence, the 4 stars.",

I wouldn't say this is the most authentic Japanese food, but it was all really yummy, so who cares? (^^) We came in a huuuge group - I think there were 25 of us - so the staff made us a tasty set menu that was incredibly filling. The chicken was covered in some kind of gooey sauce which didn't taste Japanese...but was really moorish. The karaage, miso and maki roles were all good (although it was strange to have spicy sauce served with sushi!!)  We were with some staff from the Embassy of Japan, and the Japan Local Government Centre in London. They were so happy to have Japanese food in Edinburgh, that they all left smiling and happy! Lastly there is a karaoke room downstairs. They don't have a large selection of songs, but they let us plug in a sing-star... and allowed us to sing until we all lost our voices. Yay!  I would give this place 3 stars for the food...but the staff were really sweet and accommodating... so they get an extra star.  Ooooh! I just thought of a strange thing! Next to the ladies loo is a staircase that leads to nowhere! wtf? I came out of the loo and started walking up these trick stairs...only to hit my head on the celling! Beware tipsy folks!!",

The best was the vegetable roll. Oh, and they are stingy with the ginger. And yes, everything was rather pricey; this was mitigated by the fact that they offer a 10% discount to students (but you have to pay in cash). So far, the best sushi I've had has been No. 1 Sushi Bar in Tollcross.",

The service is friendly and helpful, they were very accommodating for my friend with a gluten intolerance. I don't believe it is purely Japanese cuisine, as I think my mother ordered something she was told was Korean. I'm a particular fan of the bento box - it's kind of a \"build your own\" deal, choosing the meat/tofu and the sauce, and any extras. I also love the vegetable tempura, very light delicious batter, and the plum wine. Plenty of vegetarian options too! Lovely decor, cosy lighting.",

    "text": "After a late start to the day, and a fabulous croissant from Valvona and Crolla with a generous dollop of Claire Leslie's strazzberry jam for brunch, I'm ready for lunch.  By the time I made my way across the Meadows, there was a growl in my belly. I've had Japanese food 3 times in the past week; first dinner at Yes Sushi on Hanover Street on Friday, then Number One Sushi on Home street on Sunday evening, and finally Izzi on Lothian road for lunch yesterday.  Today I thought I'd try Koyama on Forrest road. I've been past it on my way into town many times, but have always been in too much of a rush to go in.  My first impression on entering was this place is much larger, with a set up similar to sushi restaurants in Canada and the US. Some booths as well as small tables, red paper lanterns, and Hokusai prints on the walls.  Although I'd consider myself adventurous in what I eat, I must admit I have my 'usuals' when I eat Japanese. Unagi (eel) nigiri and hand roll, sea bass sashimi and some sort of noodle soup.  The problem was, today the menu outside was very different to the menu I was presented with. Quite a few things had disappeared, including the hearty noodle soups and the unagi hand roll. In fact, the only mention of eel was in a maki roll and in an unagi don style rice dish. I was told this was the 'Festival menu', and no, the chef could not make any of the missing items from the regular menu. Not a good start, as that just had me thinking the sushi was not freshly made.  I ordered sea bass and salmon sashimi, and decided to try the eel maki. For my main dish I had the mixed seafood yaki udon.  The salmon sashimi was sliced a bit thick for my taste, less delicate pieces of fish and more generous mouthfuls. The sea bass sashimi was fine, topped with firm roe and sliced thinly.  The eel maki had a bit too much rice and not enough eel, though there was a nice crunch of cucumber. Disappointingly, there was barely any eel to speak of.  My udon came with panko-fried prawns and pieces of various other seafood,  which tasted suspiciously like scampi! The prawns had a nice crisp crust though, which was the high point of the dish. The noodles were slightly overcooked and limp, and the sauce lacked robust flavour.  To top things off, I was then informed by the waitress that despite the sign advertising a 10% student discount, this only applied if I paid in cash! I spoke to the manager and she allowed me the discount, but I think it's a little misleading as there was no mention of cash payments only on the sign in their window!  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt here as it is Festival season, and normal rules don't apply, evidently. It was a disappointing experience and a mediocre meal, but I may go back and try their wares when it's back to the normal menu.",

    "text": "We bobbed in to grab a pre-show bite during the Edinburgh festival. The restaurant was buzzing and the menu looked good so we sat down for some noodles and sushi. Looking back I imagine this place is no way near as busy when the Fringe isn't on.  The service was a little awkward and quite slow. I ordered mixed tempura and teppanyaki ramen which took a while to arrive and were tasty, but not overwhelming. Koyama is a nice place with a warm atmosphere and a good selection of sushi, noodle dishes, curries and drinks but a lax delivery in taste and service which makes it a pretty run of the mill place for a meal.",
