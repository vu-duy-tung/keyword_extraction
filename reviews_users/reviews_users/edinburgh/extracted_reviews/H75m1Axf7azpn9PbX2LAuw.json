Others in the family tried avocado toast, fabulous, and the shakshuka, incredibly delicious as well! The coffee was perfection and the service was very pleasant. Highly recommend!",

We ended up getting some incredible filo mince pies along with our croissants.   As we waited for everything to be boxed up, we got to take in the atmosphere. Beautifully decorated with plenty of floor space, Toast is an inviting spot with a delicious sounding menu. I would absolutely love to come back for a meal in the not too distant future!",
