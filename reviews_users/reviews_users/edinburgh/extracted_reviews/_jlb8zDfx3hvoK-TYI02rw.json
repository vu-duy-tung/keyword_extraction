There is art work on display that is for sale too which is a fab. There isn't much seating though that's the only thing, a couple of tables outside and a narrow breakfast bar inside and what looks to be like a church pew along the wall but worth a pop in for a snack. It says on yelp that it isn't open on Sunday but it is, so get yourself down there!",

You'll find no tables inside; just benches and stools that you can sit on and people-watch while you eat.    I stopped by here for a quick bite the other day, and was anything but pleased; my Brie and Cranberry toastie turned out to be a complete catastrophe.  The hot cheese leaked all over my hand, and I stopped just short of dashing off to have my burns treated in the ER ;-)  To be fair, maybe their sandwiches are fine, and I need more training in eating toasties - don't know that I'm going to hurry back soon to find out though.",

Prefilled rolls and baguettes of different combinations to the usual or choose your own. The coffee was also spot on, from a local roasting company. Well worth the 2 mins stroll out of grassmarket - you will not regret it. I think we will be amending our plans to pass by tomorrow now :-)",

It's super small and is run by the single owner which is nice and patient even when there is a queue. I had a cup of homemade lentils soup and a vegetarian Haggis. I didn't like the Haggis at all, but it was sure nice to try a vegetarian version, as it was my first time in Scottland. I paid about 5 Pound for both, so overall it was a great deal. The place has free wifi, just ask for the password.",

Popular with those who work in the area you want to get in early to guarantee you get some soup and they once ran out of baguettes (hot BLT in a largish roll sufficed).  The staff are friendly and happy to make things up for you, and there is always an interesting selection of music playing in the background while you queue or wait. All in all a great place to get your soup and sandwich.",

I've been here a few times and it always offers pleasant, quick service and a comfortable environment to enjoy your lunch in.  The food is also excellent.  They have a great range of sandwiches from prawn mayonnaise to mature cheddar and onion.  I usually go for the tuna mayo with cucumber and bag of crisps.  It costs less than 3 and tastes amazing with delcious bread and really fresh salad.   Further, they're never stingy with their portion sizes and you really feel like you're getting value for your money.  Haven't tried the soup myself, but my friends rave about it, especially the tomato and pepper.   If you're in the area and fancy a delicious, cheap lunch then Bobby's Sandwich Bar is the place.",

Overall, we said: \"Bobby's served me very nicely. Both the soup and roll were very good, and the range of sandwiches on offer was such that your interest is likely to be well retained, should this be your local sandwich place. Now, if they could just get some bags so that folks can properly brown-bag their lunch, they'd have me stopping-by on a regular basis.\"",

    "text": "The best tuna with sweetcorn baguette in Edinburgh.  Fact    The tuna sweetcorn baguette was my lifeline when I was in uni.  I used to buy cheesy Doritos from across the way and put them in the baguette.  No joke, I am actually salavating a little as I type this.    I don't know what it was but the sweetcorn was wonderfully fresh and sweet, tuna not too fishy, just right on the mayo, and the baguette was wonderfully crispy on the outside and gorgeously soft on the inside.  I am seriously starving now.    When I go back, I will be getting a bacon sarnie, as per Mary L's recommendation.    My only complaint is that it's only open until 2 or 3pm (at least it used to be) so I can't go there right now.",

I think because sandwich bars are less of a one off place that you'll visit, and more of a regular everyday thing, particularly if you work in the area, it's important to find a decent place, and if it ticks the boxes, stick with it. Bobby's ticks several. It's easy to get to, being right on the main road and near Chambers St, Forrest Road, and George IV Bridge. It's also reasonably priced, and has a good variety of food stuffs to pick from, with bagels, toasted sandwiches, normal, not toasted sandwiches, and soup, all tastily filled and flavoured. The staff are super nice too, which always makes me more enthusiastic about handing my money over several times a week.",

As the ladies have outlined, it's open till mid afternoon, so it's not one to amble into at the back of 4 for a pre dinner snack. But if you can shake off the covers early (or are forced to due to work commitments), they make a mean breakfast.  Aside from selling a decent selection of teas, coffee, panini's and cake, their soup of the day is cheap and very tasty. As Lynsey said, you can go all out and treat yourself to some greasy spoon (the healthy soup cancels out the fatty fry, honest), and still find you spend little over a fiver.  For the bright eyed and bushy tailed, Bobby's does the job. It's a thriving wee business that is no doubt the first stop for many office workers and students in the area.",

It's pretty damn good, but  I have to say that It seems as though it has a pretty average selection of sandwich fillings. Theres nothing that really jumps out at you from the menu board - but its not like theres nothing that wont get your mouth watering. The fillings are usually pretty huge, and theres a nice selection of breads too.  I think this place does breakfast and soups too, as well as cakes etc. Overall, its pretty cheap, which is always nice too :)",

The queue was rather sizable, but the service was really fast, and by the time I got to the front of the queue the waft of soup had really taken me in. It was a hot day, but it really smelt amazing! That along with a bottle of Irn Bru to balance out the hotness and I was good to go.  The soup was thick and full of lumpy bits of veg and loads of lentils, which I absolutely love. I had a crusty roll with it too which tasted as though it had just been baked, delicious. It was very inexpensive too and I had change from 3, bargain.",
