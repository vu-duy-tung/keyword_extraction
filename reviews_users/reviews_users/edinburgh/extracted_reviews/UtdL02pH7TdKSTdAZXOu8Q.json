    "text": "We stopped by this little cafe today for a quick bite before the castle. I had Le Parisienne sandwich with jambon blanco.  Their baguettes made on premise are much nicer than an average cafe sandwich baguette, with a crusty outside and light & soft inside.  The cheese and ham were both good in quality.    They have sandwiches that specify mayo on the menu, of which I opted not to choose.  My sandwich came, and it was de-lish. Simple, quality ingredients.  Onto the second half..a pocket-ful of mayo! A bit taken back, as I am not a fan of mayo.  But I never say never..if done right, I can let it go.  This was the case this time, I didn't mind it so much, and enjoyed the rest of the sandwich.   A nice place to pop on by for a quickie bite, with peace and no-pressure friendly french fare.  Nice casual, simple, good.  I was hungry and left content :)   Merci~ prob will be back again",

The croissants are fabulous and exactly how they make them in France: light, flaky on the outside and buttery and chewy on the inside. The Assam breakfast tea I had was malty and comforting, and my boyfriend's flat white was good. We had a salmon and cream cheese baguette sandwich and quiche Lorraine, both of which were flavorful and satisfying. We'll likely be back this trip!",

The sandwich had been waiting 3 hours for me too, but it was I didn't even notice any sogginess ! He also brought me a chocolate salted Carmel macron which was so delicious!

    "text": "Perfect little French Cafe!  I've been to La Barantine in Bruntsfield once ages ago - loved it but am rarely up that side of town.  My friend and I had just finished the Santa Run and thought we had earned ourselves a treat so I turned to Yelp to see what was nearby and was delighted with the suggestion of La Barantine near the Grassmarket.- we peeked in and saw that every one of the tables in the tiny seating area were taken.  A friendly couple saw us and indicated that there were two stools free at the window counter.  A bit wonky but we were cold and hungry so we nabbed them (luckily the friendly couple were nearly finished so we grabbed their table).    The waitress was re-assuredly French, friendly and efficient.  Within minutes we had the options explained and had placed our orders.  The Soup and baguettes combo was the perfect choice and a nice value.  Soup of the day was a thick, rich sweet potato and parsnip.  Very tasty and the crispy croutons on top were an added bonus.   The 'Savoie' baguette was EXCEPTIONAL.  The baguette was light, crispy on the outside, soft and airy inside.  Just the right amount of filling - every ingredient could be tasted - all in balance - all full of flavour. I can still taste it now.  It was so filling that we didn't have room for cakes - but they all looked gorgeous and I did try them in Bruntsfield so I can vouch that they do taste as good as they look.    La Barantine is perfect for collecting your baguettes and croissants, or sitting in for cakes and a hot bevvie or for breakfast or lunch (if you can grab a table).",

I walked passed it at first, but was drawn to it by the amazing Eifeltower of Macaroons displayed in their shop window. So I turned around. It's a very small coffee shop with about 6 tables. I ordered a Cafe Latte, 2 macaroons (salted caramel and pistachio) and a La Croque Monsieur. They are selling some amazing macaroons, tarts, french baguette , french bread and other french pastries (like Croissants). Did I mentioned that this place is French :-) The service was a bit stiff and the prices are not cheap as you are in \"Town\", but they do some offers as well, like a drink, a sandwich and a dessert for either 7.20 or 9.80. I really liked the Latte. They know how to do a proper coffee.",

I had just gazed at a tower of macarons in the window after walking down the hill from the Royal Mile on my way back to my car parked in the Grassmarket. Within a couple of minutes I realised that my \"bonjour\" was partly to do with the fact that very little English was spoken in the cafe... I had basically just stepped into Paris from Edinburgh.   The staff in La Barantine Victoria were really friendly. It had the feel of a family-owned business, which may actually be the case.   I had the La Basque sandwich. It was a fresh baguette with chicken, mayo, roasted peppers and salad. I couldn't resist putting it down. Even though it was a big sandwich, I wanted more just because it tasted so good. I decided to go with the lunch deal of a sandwich (or quiche), hot drink, and... wait for it... a macaron. I had a nice pot of English Assam Breakfast tea which was tasty and at a good strength. And then I went with a salted caramel macaron, which was divine.   It doesn't look like it from the outside, but there's actually seating inside, so grab a table and savour the goodness of La Brantine.   La Barantine Victoria is great and should be on your list of places to try, even if you're getting a baguette, quiche or macaron to take away.",

The kind of place where the clerk says, \"Bonjour!\" when you step in and then continues the conversation she was having with the waitress in French.   The pastries, appealingly placed in a window case to attract passersby, looked divine. But as we were feeling a bit more peckish, they were not for us. Instead we ordered two coffees and some of their heartier fare: a lentil soup and La Parisien sandwich. The soup was very good, warm, creamy, and hearty just as it should be, and came with a generous serving of 6-8 slices of baguette with pats of scottish butter. The sandwich was also very tasty, although perhaps less my speed, with the inclusion of egg.   Overall, lovely place, good ambiance, and can't wait to go back and try the remarkable looking pastries!",

The vegetable quiche is amazing and comes with a healthy portioned side salad (note: salad apparently doesn't come with quiches when you do take away). Their cappuccino had some of the best art I've seen, and their croissants are to die for. I ordered both a chocolate and a regular croissant and was planning to save one for later but couldn't because they were that good...  Come here if you're visiting Edinburgh, you won't be disappointed! P.S. They do NOT have WiFi in case you were wondering (as of Oct. 2018).",

The cafe culture in Edinburgh is something I haven't been able to find yet back home in D.C., and La Barantine Victoria adds a lot to the offerings that Edinburgh has.   The atmosphere is quite nice, combining the old stone look of Victoria Street with that French charm. I ordered a cappuccino and the Le Normand sandwich. The cappuccino was the best I'd had in Edinburgh (I'd had about 4 in my 5 days there). I also really loved the sandwich. It came on a baguette and was filled with butter, ham, brie, and salad. It's something I would have eaten on my many days in Belgium and it made me feel like I was back in my childhood, which was a great feeling.   I would recommend La Barantine Victoria if you're walking down Victoria Street looking for a place to grab a quick bite or a coffee. Their pastries and viennoiseries looked really good too!",

I'm not much of a coffee person, but ordered the Hazelnut Macchiato Latte with some pastries. My drink was creamy, flavorful, and a touch of sweet. It was delicious! One of the very best coffees I've had in Europe and that's coming from a picky drinker. Also, the staff are so kind and wonderful, and the shop is adorable. Would love to come again!",

I had a very ample flat white that was absolutely the best cup of coffee I have had out in some time and I'm pretty picky when it comes to coffee. I had a croissant with butter and jam that was nice too. My wife and daughter had sandwiches which they both enjoyed as well. Definitely worth stopping in for a bite if you are in the neighborhood.",

    "text": "La Barantine Victoria is an OK coffee shop; the venue is in a really nice setting, and the overall quality is better than a typical chain coffee place.  I came here for breakfast and ordered an eclair, which was acceptable, though nothing to write home about.  It was just short of being too dry, and didn't really taste like it was worth the 6 it cost me for that an espresso.  That price would have been fine if the quality had been better, but it was just too high for the quality I received.  Given the fact that the staff wasn't particularly friendly or welcoming, and I didn't go away with an overwhelming desire to return.  The girl working the counter really brightened up when a person who was apparently a regular came in, which made the lack of welcome I encountered that much more noticeable.  Bottom line: There are a number of places close by where the coffee and food are better, and you're likely to be greeted with a smile even if you're not a regular.",

And the coffee here is just perfect. I adore the soft and slightly bitter taste of cappuccino which wakes me up instantly. Well, the owners did a great job with that place and i'm thankful to them. I think that everyone should come here at least once and feel this peaceful atmosphere.",
