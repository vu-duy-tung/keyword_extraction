    "text": "So Good is a sterling example of a Chinese takeaway, the satay skewers or ribs are great starters and the mains from Kung Po to Szechaun are enjoyable, good quality and a decent portion.  What boosts So Good above the regular good Chinese though is the Thai specialities, I have worked my way through most of these and enjoyed them all. Thai food still isn't that common in Edinburgh, so being able to pop into a local takeaway on the way home is ideal.  All in all then, So Good offers good Chinese and a small selection of Thai dishes making it an ideal takeaway.",

    "text": "It was edible. I didn't enjoy my meal. I've had much better Chinese takeaways. It was more expensive than the usual takeaway I go to. The Szechuan king prawn was terrible. They had added weird flavours that made it floral and unpleasant. The egg fried rice was over done. The veggie spring rolls were soggy and flat with a weird taste in the middle. The chips were good. The prawn crackers were dry.   The bottom line is, I will not return to so good Chinese.",

    "text": "My flatmates and I ordered from So Good a few months ago and although the food did take a while to arrive, it was delicious when it did.  We had a menu thrust under our door during Fresher's Week and it sat in our hall until we felt hungry and lazy enough to use it.   The menu has the usual range of Chinese classic dishes and I went for the crispy chilli shredded beef along with fried rice and a bag of prawn crackers.  They said they would be 20 minutes, but in reality it was more like 50, and they charged a fiver at the door for it.   Nonetheless, the food was tasty and filling.  The beef was good quality and the spicy sauce which accompanied it was delicious.   I'd certainly recommend ordering from So Good, just be prepared for a bit of a wait.",

Knocked 1 star off due to the pictures on the menu not reflecting the dishes at all. A friend ordered the Pad Thai which came in a sweet and sour sauce (not listed or shown in the picture). I would recommended the deep fried shredded chicken!",

    "text": "By far the worst Thai food I have ever eaten. I'm not entirely sure why a Chinese takeaway would try to do Thai as the food is vastly different, so my fault for ordering it I guess.   I can't even begin to tell you how horrific the food was. I knew I might be in trouble the moment I opened the container of King Prawn Tom Yom soup. It was an alarming shade of orange and had a layer of oil floating on top. I can only describe it as a bowl of oil with roughly 3 prawns and half a bottle of fish sauce thrown in, (and possibly some red/orange food colouring). It was so salty I could only take a few spoonsful then go drink a pint of water. The Thai Veg Green Curry was equally disappointing. Not necessarily as disgusting as the soup, but it lacked any kind of sauce and consisited mainly of green peppers. Now, I'm no world traveller, but I do have a Thai friend who owns her own shop so I'm pretty sure that Thailand has more vegetables to offer than green peppers. Plus, what little sauce there was tasted mainly of a can of coconut milk. None of the wonderful balance of flavours Thai food is known for. Next. Fish Cakes. Again, the alarming orange/red colour blinded me when I opened the container. They were wierd little hockey pucks that tasted like something that was scraped off the floor of a fishmongers and had the consistancy of rubber. Last: The Chili Dipping Sauce was a tub of vinegar with a few green chili slices thrown in for effect. I've never written a review of a restaurant before, so forgive me for going on about this, but seriously, this place is really really awful. Lesson learned. If you want Thai food, go to a proper Thai restaurant.",

Also, heard about the below incident with the theft of the door ornament, what isn't said here is the delivery guy returned the ornament to be assaulted by its owner! So good are one of the best Chinese takeaways in the area and would highly recommend it.",

    "text": "It is not easy to find a good Chinese takeaway in the city, although their number grows like mushrooms n a rainy season. I have always been amazed at the way owners of such small businesses choose the names of their takeaways. Another good thing about takeaways is they are almost 24/7 open, So Good is open 7 days per week, starting from 4 am until 11pm. The place prepares spicy, mild spicy and non-spicy meals. It has a good range of curries, Thai specials and a couple of good offers for vegetarians. The prices are reasonable and the quality is good.",
