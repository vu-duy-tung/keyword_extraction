Situated just around the corner from the Royal Mile, The Advocate is just a short walk from the city centre and so it is a convenient place to reach and always seems to be a popular choice with the tourists.   I don't have anything particular against The Advocate, its just that I have been here on several occasions and each time I haven't had the best experience. The pub is generally filled with locals, and if you go in during the afternoon, most of them are drunk and looking at you in a really sleazy way - not nice.  Most of the time the staff have been friendly, but occasionally there are some workers who completely fail to acknowledge your presence and you can be stood waiting at the bar for ages to be served. The Advocate serves above average pub food and the prices are really reasonable too. I would like to come back here for a meal again, but the drunk locals and the poor service has put off for the time being.",

    "text": "The Advocate is located in Hunter Square, right near the junction between the Royal Mile and South / North Bridge.  It's a place I've only been to once for drinks, and I can't say that I was blown away by what it offered.  We were in there on a fairly quiet weekday evening, and the atmosphere was pleasant enough.  Drinks were of a reasonable price, and I would have totally got some food if I hadn't already eaten that evening.  Two evening meals would have been a little excessive.  Anyway, this place isn't really on my radar now as a place for going out for a drink to.  I can't really comment on the alcohol beverages on offer, as I'm not a drinker, but everyone else I was with seemed to get on just fine.  It's not a hotspot for a night out, but still well worth a look in.",

I could have used a bit more friendliness, but as I said before, I think this is a European thing...Sufficient service at best.  There was a menu printing error regarding the special of two entrees for $10 each; which apparently was only select days of the week. Since the actual days that said special was honored were not printed on the menu the restaurant wasn't going to give us the stated price. After a few words with a manager, they honored the menu and apologized for the error +1 star for some honest business.  The food was decent; nothing to write home about, but we were full!   However, four of us didn't feel good AT ALL later that night and there was some bathroom jockeying going about. Highly suspicious if you ask me! -2 stars.",

A great option if you fancy keeping track of the match, but also want to enjoy a bit of quiet chat/banter with your friends.   The pub itself is delightful, a mix of booth seats, cosy corners and high tables with stools, warm lighting in fascinating light hangings, and walls papered with sheet music and gentle, unimposing red tartan. There is a wide selection of real ales (I had a Raven Ale from the Orkney's) and a good whiskey selection. The food is also delicious -- standard pub grub, burgers and what not, but well prepared, tasty and served with a smile to your table.   A good option if you find yourself in the Royal Mile/North Bridge area.",

Unlike the student, party like atmosphere at the Tron, the Advocate has got that slight old man, traditional feel. But seeing as not many old people, or any people really, come in here it has almost no atmosphere whatsoever. To be frank it's pretty boring. I've been in there a few times, and each time it has been really quiet and you feel awkward talking, in case you disturb the perfectly preserved silence. It's not a great feel for a pub to have.  The inside is quite nice though, with a few little nooks and crannies to hide away in. There is a big old traditional bar selling all the normal drinks at pretty average prices. They used to do a student discount, but that no longer is the case. I haven't had the food, but I would assume it is very much like the rest of the pub - dull",

That sounded crazy delicious to us, if you will, but being that we were heading to dinner, we didn't want to order a whole sandwich or a full meal with mash, spinach, etc. Originally we just decided to bag the idea, but after the bartenders conferred, they offered to just charged us 1.50 pound for one sausage, so we could try it. So nice of them! The cutie bartender also got bonus points for copious amounts of sausage jokes throughout this endeavor. Well played, Advocate!  Oh, and that sausage WAS delicious.

The Advocate features a pleasant, traditional pub decor, including a few nods to the \"American theme\" (they did offer a July 4th Independence menu, e.g.) - although the regular menu features Scottish (haggis) and traditional pub food. At least twice during my nine-day stay there was live music too: A rather talented, rather big, brawny guy. He was singing old style rock songs on one evening, more folk-oriented stuff on the other.   The selection of ales and lagers is certainly decent, the prices moderate for this expensive city. This being a Belhaven-owned pub though, the real ales they serve are from said brewery, which is certainly not the most distinguished in Scotland (that includes \"The Advocate\" beer, which most certainly is Belhaven-brewed, too).   Had the 8 Oz rump steak there (see photo), which was quite all right but certainly not exceptional.   Atmosphere was pleasant indeed, the bar staff friendly and efficient (!). This is certainly NOT \"a downmarket Whetherspoons\", as wrongly suggested by \"Emily H.\"",

    "text": "Edinburgh, August, Busy! 3 words that will always go hand in hand and, erm... a third hand? But it was getting on 2 o'clock and dinner, as my dad calls it, can't be missed. In fact it was almost unacceptable to call this dinner, as dinner in the land of my dad happens between 12 and 12.30 - 1 at the latest. We may as well have just packed up and gone home and waited for tea*. But we didn't...  We darted from place to place to find 4 seats,  no luck. But just a hop and a jump from the Royal Mile we found The Advocate. Seats -  great! We're going in! \"There must be something wrong with it\" I heard my superior scoff. But after a hearty baguette and chips and a wee pint in traditional pub surroundings, we found that there's nothing wrong with this place at all. My dad may have rejected all attempts to conform to middle class convention with his naming of meals (and too many more to mention), but he knows when he's satisfied.  * a hot evening meal eaten between 5 and 5.30 in my dad's book of everything.",

Even though it was so close to the Royal Mile, it wasn't anywhere near as crowded as the pubs up there, which was wonderful. Highly recommend this place!",

    "text": "When you find yourself looking for a quiet drink with friends around Hunter square, look no further! Even though this isn't the greatest pub around, the other bars around here are mostly aimed at students and often have loud music.... oh god I sound like a granny! The pints are fairly pricey (average 3.50) but it is the centre of Edinburgh so what you gonna do. There is a good amount of seating, and the clientele is a mixture of regulars at the bar, groups in the corners and people watching the football/rugby. Bathrooms are clean, staff is nice, drinks selection is fine. The only thing missing is a bit of atmosphere and character. All in all, a decent pub, but nothing special.",

    "text": "For reasons which were unclear to me at the time, The Man and I decided to have a beer in the Advocate in order to watch one of the World Cup games.  I'm sure there were millions of other pubs in the area showing the games, but we chose the Advocate.  It felt like a downmarket Whetherspoons, and smelled like toilet cleaner.   The bar served mediocre beers, to be consumed on sticky tables which sat on crazy old pub carpet. And yeah, the smell.  So we had our one pint, and even The Man decided that the game wasn't so important to make us stay.",

    "text": "Cozy, entertaining and whiskey choices!  Thought we needed a drink and passed by the Advocate on a busy Friday night. The Edinburgh streets were buzzing with people of all ages, creating a lively atmosphere and the pubs and bars were packed. It was really hard to get a table, well, even a chair.......  Luckily, when entering the place, we got a high table with a few chairs. We soon realized that we could get variations of whiskey choices. Good for the whiskey fanatics amongst us. The restaurant and the pub are only separated by a wood barrier and hardly noticeable. You can sit in a booth and have your dinner, whilst people have drinks around the bar.  Its a place where you can eat and drink and listen to live music entertainment. They guy who was singing last night had a very nice smokey voice (like Joe Cocker) and we all sang along: \"No women, no cry\". Whoop Whoop.  It's only 4 stars as I have not tried the food yet, and will definitely be back.",

Food is a mixture if renowned bar snacks, burgers, steaks or chicken wings. Vegetarian food is available too.  Quite a selection of drafts. Atmosphere is welcoming friendly and apart from the 3 massive tv screens it could've easily passed as an victorian pub. OK.  Coat hooks on the bar. Nice touch!",

    "text": "Dinky little pub on Hunter Square that's ideal for a quick drink heading home or just heading in to town, but not quite big enough to spend a stretch of time in without getting a little cramped.  Owned/sponsored by Belhaven, this pub is linked to the White Hart bar in the Grassmarket and the World's End bar on the Royal Mile. How The Advocate squares up to the rest of the Belhaven pubs I'm not too sure but taking it at face value it is a nifty little pub that had an impressive selection of whiskies for a small bar.  There isn't an awful lot of space in this bar making it feel quite closed in as you can be standing a couple of feet away from people eating dinner as you're drinking a beer and watching the football on the TV.  I never tried the food as I was only passing by but with what I seen it looked like general pub fare with things like burgers, sandwiches and steak pie (do you really need anything else in a pub?)  A few bottled craft beers were available from Belhaven at around 3.40 per bottle. Tucked away between the Cowgate, the Bridges and the Royal Mile, it's only understandable that they sold \"The Advocate\" beanie hats too. I have to admit that I was very tempted to get on.  Service was good, pub was nice and warm for it being a cold afternoon and the beer was cold. Definitely worth a visit if you're passing through.",
