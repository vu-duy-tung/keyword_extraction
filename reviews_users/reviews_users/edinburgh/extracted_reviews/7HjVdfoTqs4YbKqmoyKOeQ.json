But decided to give it another go and have ordered a couple of times since then and it's been fine. I really like the stuffed crust pizzas and they have quite a good choice of starters too. We love their desert, think it's called 'choccy bites' that's 48 tiny chocolate covered pieces of ice cream, they're great!",

The name change to pasta hut is not a bad choice as the pasta is absolutely scrumptious. They have a great dessert, cookie dough which in my opinion is the best dessert ever.",

They do a great selection of pizza, pasta and extras and it is great value.  The staff are really friendly and it has a nice local feel to it as the staff always seem to know people eating there. There is not much room to eat in though but you can take away or have food delivered.",

    "text": "This Pizza Hut is always a pleasure to order with for my takeaways. Staff are very polite and are great at pointing out deals and making sure you get the best out of them possible. Deliveries always in good time, usually within about 20-30 minutes and I've never had a complaint about them. Orders arrive hot and just as ordered, and the delivery guys are always very polite, so I have no hesitation over tipping them! Actually, I've just realised that it is always guys, not sure why that is, don't girls get into pizza delivery? It may well be a safety thing I guess, but I've given myself something to ponder now! I've never dealt with any other Pizza Hut outlets, but if this one is anything to go by, you won't be disappointed. I do recall once having ordered two side portions of wedges and only receiving one - I told the delivery guy not to worry about it, on reflection it was just as well as I'm not sure my hips could take it! He arrived back at the door 20 minutes later, with the extra side portion, having already deducted the cost from my bill - what service!",

The Edinburgh Pizza Hut is a clean, tidy restaurant with friendly and helpful staff. Whenever I visit Edinburgh, which is often, I enjoy a trip here for a quick bite to eat. The staff are helpful and were very understanding when my partner wasn't feeling well through a meal  they boxed everything up to go for us. The restaurant is easy to get to from the centre and close to the local Travelodge that I stay in. 5 stars!",
