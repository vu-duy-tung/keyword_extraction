    "text": "Henderson's seems like a nice place to have lunch. The atmosphere is relaxed, the service is nice and it feels like they've made an effort to make the place seem friendly and welcoming. Their menu has a lot of dishes that change regularly which I like in a restaurant although I suppose it could be a little frustrating if you wanted a good idea of what would be available beforehand. I'm not a vegetarian but I'm always happy to go to vegetarian restaurants as it stops me automatically choosing the same stuff every time I eat out. My only reservation about this is that if you're only going to do vegetarian food, it should be done well and imaginatively. I wanted to like Henderson's more than I did in the end because it seems like it should be a good place. It was ok but not great and a little overpriced especially for the drinks. Hopefully I just caught them on an off day. I had the crepe which was filled with courgette, mushroom, something else, and cream cheese although it tasted a lot more like cream than cream cheese, making the whole thing a bit too wet. It was nice enough if unspectacular and came with a good salad which was a lot better than the token garnish you often get. My parents both had soup and the lentil and apricot pate. They're both very polite and described the pate as subtle. In other words it didn't taste of anything.  All in all it was a little disappointing but I think it has the potential to be much better than my experience of it and anyone else might get more out of it on a different occasion.",

    "text": "Absolutely Perfect! Great Vegan spot and best place to eat in Edinburgh!  They have the best Jackfruit Dish.  Order: Jackfruit Tomato and Coconut Stew, Broccoli, Benromach Organic Speyside Single Malt, and Bunkertons Organic Perry (cider)  Environment: Small quaint little spot with a wonderful staff.  Service was perfect with a small menu and daily specials.    Verdict: This is a definite MUST if you are visiting Edinburgh.  Vegan or not, this place has amazing food and great prices.  The jackfruit stew was the BEST jackfruit dish I have ever had (hearty and flavorful).  The broccoli was delicious and the whiskey was superb.  Parking: there is plenty of parking (if you drive).  Walking: Easily a beautiful walk and neighborhood.  Tip #1: Go to the Restaurant - it is not the one on the corner, but down the small street Tip #2: avoid the ciders - get the whiskeys (they are superb) Tip #3: utilize Apple Pay - it will make your life easier to pay",

We shared a celeriac gnocchi dish and the veggie haggis. The gnocchi was hard and tough to chew. The haggis was interesting but too peppery for my palate. The most annoying aspect of the dining experience was two hours of reggae music.",

The first day I asked the lady behind the counter to for plate that would give me the opportunity to try as many items as possible (see picture). She was fantastic and much to my surprise I loved every single thing I tried! When we left we decided to get a hot drink for our walk through the park - the manager fixed me my first Turmeric Latte and permanently altered my palette for Chai. My new go- to-must-have  comfort drink is now Turmeric Latte. What a great guy. I spent the rest of my trip (2 weeks) looking for a Turmeric Latte that was even close to what this place makes. Non were close. They put fresh Ginger in theirs and on my last visit he said he was going to start adding pepper because it increased the effectiveness of the Turmeric. LUCKY people who live in Edinburgh!!!  Next day I tried the Beet root Latte. I want you to know I hate beets. And he told me that a woman that worked there also disliked beets and liked this Latte. So I tried. I was pretty darn good - but no where near the love affair I now have with Turmeric Lattes.   My daughter is a tiny thing - and I noticed on our second visit that she came to the table with a tray full! I laughed and laughed. She too loved this special place!",

    "text": "Henderson's seems to be somewhat of an institution in Edinburgh. They have a couple different locations, one of which I think is a bit more casual. However, the one my partner and I went to was a slightly higher end dining experience, with an excellent menu and thoughtful ingredients.  First, would definitely recommend getting reservations ahead of time. When we arrived on a Wednesday night for dinner, most of the tables in their somewhat small place were reserved. Fortunately, they were able to get us seated quickly nonetheless, which was much appreciated. Kudos to the friendly hostess, who was busy moving around the space attending to everyone's needs with much finesse.  For our dinner, we started with a cheese plate, and then shared a rice dish and haggis as starters. The cheese plate was really superb. The cheeses were cashew based, and it made me realize how much I miss having access to places that know how to do this well. The rice dish featured tofu, mushrooms, some greens, and a couple pickled veggies. The mix of veggies, particularly the pickled ones, was a bit of a surprise, but in a good way. The haggis, which I enjoyed more, was lentil based and had some delicious purple potatoes on the side.  While all of this was quite filling, we couldn't resist getting dessert, as carrot cake was on the menu! It was delightfully decadent, with some strawberry sauce drizzled over it.  After dining at Henderson's, it was easy to see why they've been a mainstay in Edinburgh for so long. Would certainly recommend as a place for a few friends to come together, a date night, or perhaps just to get a chance of pace from some of the more fast casual vegan options that tend to be more prevalent nowadays.",

The quaintness of the cafe is charming. I felt as though I was seated at home because you can see the chef in the kitchen as you are seated in the cafe, thus all the aromas gently fill the charmed space. There's WiFi to keep you occupied- in case you need it, but use the time to meet people and chat about their Scotland experiences. The food and tasty drinks and the music over the speakers made the afternoon perfect!",

    "text": "On two separate occasions we went to Henderson's, once we went to the upstairs market for lunch, the second time we went downstairs to sit for breakfast.   Upstairs: It was the middle of their lunch rush and it was our first time at Henderson's. We didn't understand how we were supposed to order, their menu was confusing and the waitresses quickly became frustrated and rude when we asked them to explain it to us. The food itself was fairly standard, it was fresh but the flavors did not mix well together and their burgers were dry.   Downstairs: Our waitress was kind and accommodating but didn't understand us when we asked her questions. For example: we asked if they had any milk alternatives besides soy, she said no, and later on we saw someone using coconut milk.  The porridge was hard as a rock and barely edible. The vegan pancakes had the consistency of wet socks. It was hard to cut even with a knife, and chewy. We presume the pancakes were not freshly prepared. They were soaked in syrup (which I assumed would have come on the side not already poured) and sickly sweet, most likely to disguise the hard pancakes. The fruit was mostly hard. The eggs were drenched in milk and inedible. For a place that claims to be organic and vegan they most certainly do not know how to prepare vegan food, they couldn't even properly prepare non vegan food (eggs).  As someone who predominately eats a vegan/vegetarian diet and has eaten at numerous restaurants throughout the United States and Europe, this place is by far one of the worst and obviously does not know how to prepare food for this type of diet well.",

    "text": "We came to Henderson's at the recommendation of my sister who hadn't been to Edinburgh in over ten years.  Coming from Los Angeles, where vegetarian and vegan food is plentiful and fine vegetarian dining is affordable, we were pretty disappointed with Henderson's Bistro.  The food was pretty \"old school\" as far as style, with huge heaps of brown rice dominating the plate and meager \"mains\" consisting mostly of 1970's ingredients like lentils and whole wheat breadcrumbs.  My dish didn't state on the menu that it was made with whole wheat, something I have to avoid, and so I was unable to eat the entire dish.  Our server (a very young girl, not too bright) failed to notice that I'd not eaten my dish at all.  In the end, we spent about $50 (US) on barely average vegetarian food that one might find in the old Lindsay Wagner cookbook.  I don't mean to be cruel, but I really could almost say that the person designing this menu is pretty clueless as is the staff.  (Our waitress didn't know the difference between white and brown rice.)  Many other Edinburgh restaurants now offer interesting vegetarian and vegan dishes.  I'd only recommend coming here if you are in the Woodstock generation and miss the early days of vegetarian eating.",

    "text": "This part of Hendersons has recently gone totally vegan - it used to be vegetarian/vegan and in the downstairs restaurant part on Hanover Street and the upstairs deli/shop you can still get vegetarian stuff.  Seating is a little cramped as the restaurant is quite small and I would say that was my only downside to the experience. Mains are a quid or two more than I would prefer to pay but it is Edinburgh, the dishes contain quite a lot of ingredients, and have a good degree of creativity to them. Also, I loved the presentation, so it's not a huge complaint.  We'd gone in around 3pm to reserve for dinner, and though it had been pretty quiet at that time when we went back later walk-in customers had a wait for a free table as the restaurant had a few other bookings, too.  As we're trying to budget a bit at the moment we got a jug of tap water and skipped dessert (the PAIN!). We shared a small nachos that was topped with veggie haggis, caramelised onion, guacamole, hot salsa, vegan cheese, and omitted the jalapenos. It was a decent sized starter for a slightly hefty 5.80 and was delicious; I'd probably get a whole portion to myself next time so I didn't need to share.    For the main I got the orange & chilli tofu nacho crumble with quinoa. The tofu is smoked, and it's marinated overnight before prepping with the crumbed topping and was really good. The side of vegetables was presented with a wedge of orange, and the quinoa with a wedge of lime, which I would suggest squeezing over the salad and quinoa to add flavour (which is probably a reason it's there and I just wasn't classy enough to figure this out!). Hubbie got the cashew fritters with rice and satay sauce which impressed him, and I was also liked from the nibble I had.  They have a specials blackboard which features a dessert, a soup, and a hummus, all of which I presume changes on a daily basis. I will return!",

There is nothing quick about this place. The services is slow, however friendly, and the food takes ages to arrive.  My partner went for the Mexican roll, which was OK - a bit on the boring side. The salad, however, was gorgeously tasty and crisp.  Risotto with mushroom was my pick after going through the menu for vegetarian/vegan food without gluten - it is amazing in itself that they could offer anything. It was OK, the mushrooms were great, but - not to pad my own back - my own risotto is better. Also, I found hair in my risotto, not that delicious. The waiters were really quick and nice to compensate for it, so no harms done.  The star of the day was the side butter squash salad. OMG! it was REALLY good - the best thing on the menu for me and probably the best butter squash dish i've ever tasted! If I had known better I would have ordered it for main. Yum!",

I ordered the nachos which were gluten free, then just omitted the salsa and instead had a delicious bean salsa. It was delicious! Plenty of cheese, sour cream, guac and nacho chips. The freshly squeezed orange juice was really nice and we had a chocolate nut cake for dessert which was nice though it was quite heavy.

I chose it because it looks exactly like Nigerian stewed beans, so my brain immediately felt it would be good. The potato salad and and brown rice are also a good bet, and the desserts are absolutely delicious. I had a fruit gateaux with soya cream (I decided I might as well go all the way) but was equally tempted by the banoffee pie which my friend raved over.  Regarding the atmosphere, it's definitely a place I could see myself whiling away the hours in. The decor is modern, but friendly and they're pictures of supposed famous people all round the walls.

    "text": "Henderson's have a bad-ass reputation amongst vegetarians in Edinburgh: i.e. it's delicious, but also a bit above our budget. It's kind of located on the Black Bo's price scale as opposed, say, David Bann's. I must admit, Henderson's Bistro was incredibly successful at getting me to eat mushrooms (I normally hate the fungi), but when I ate them there, it was absolutely delicious. Kudos to them on that front.   But, if you're a veggie, and even if you're not a veggie, this place is somewhere you really can't miss out on. So don't.",

    "text": "Finally! Made it to Hendersons - so long walking past... hello new food sensations! Well, as much as I can whilst indulging in a quite restrictive diet. Nonetheless, I tucked into a dressing-free greek salad (with feta... couldn't help myself), with a portion of baba ghanoush and Henderson's own oatcakes on the side.   So the salad - good. The baba ghanoush... a little lacking in taste and in seasonings. The oatcakes knocked my socks off. I never expected an oat cake to do that to my socks. My friend enjoyed a rather generous looking Mexican wrap.   Can't wait to try out some more when I break free from dietary restrictions.",
