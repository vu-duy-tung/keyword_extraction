    "text": "Good 2 Go offers a filling and tasty lunch for a more than reasonable price.  I often come here after classes in the nearby George Square for a great meal in the place or on the go.  As they let you know inside, they also own the Peartree and The Blind Poet, so anything you buy can simply be taken across the road.  I've never gone for this option, but it would certainly be tempting to take a nice panini across to the Peartree's beer garden on a hot day. I usually go for a cajun chicken, salad and mayonnaise panini which, along with a banana and a can of juice, costs only 3.80 - a great deal.  All their paninis and sandwiches are a good size and the bread which they use is top quality.  I recommend Good 2 Go any day for filling, tasty and cheap lunch.",

    "text": "One of the many sandwich shops on this street which has the advantage of being the only shop from which you can take your tasty treat into the opposite Blind Poet and Peartree pubs to eat. Why these two pubs don't just make the sandwiches themselves beats me, but Good 2 go usually has a very good lunch deal of panini, soup and fruit for just under 4 pounds making it an ideal spot to head for lunch.  The sandwiches I have had here are fresh and their is a satisfying choice of fillings well.   Lunch= sorted.",

    "text": "Being owned by the same people who own the Blind Poet and the Peartree House has its advantages - Good 2 Go is the only one of the many sandwich shops on West Nicholson Street that is allowed on the premises of these two great pubs - and that unique selling point has its advantages. On a sunny day, nothing is better than sitting in the beer garden with a really nice paninni and a beer. Great.  So yeah, the food here is very nice - and cheap too, with the many deals that are offered giving you option such as soup and a paninni for around 4, great value. There is also a large choice of food for you to select from, and its all fresh, which is a bonus.  On the downside, the shop is very small, so queues build up easliy, and its often slow to get service even on quieter days.  Still, this place offers a great selection of foods, and the choice to take it into the two pubs across the road is excellent.",

    "text": "The 3.80 'Panini, Soup and Fruit' deal has been a consistent staple of my lunch breaks over the past academic year. Neatly presented in a pleasant paper bag and with the freedom to eat the contents in the Blind Poet (directly opposite) I've always been satisfied by Good 2 Go's offerings.   Lunchtimes frequently result in a congested queue inside its somewhat cramped interior so its a good idea to get there early and take advantage of the Blind Poet's larger eating space. Speaking to the owner I was informed that they now do a BBQ service between 12pm-8pm at weekends in the (also opposite) Pear Tree court yard, of course this service is dependent on Scotland providing us some beaming sunshine (sigh...).",
