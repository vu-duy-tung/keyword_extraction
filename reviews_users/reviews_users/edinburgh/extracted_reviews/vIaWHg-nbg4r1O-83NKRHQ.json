Cosy, relaxed, nice service and a laid back Portuguese soundtrack all help make this a great little place. Well worth a visit, if I'm in the area I wouldn't hesitate to return!",

I would definitely recommend this place if you are around this part of town and looking forward to try more of their sweets;  Tips - On sunday, you can get 5 egg tart for the price of 4",

The Portuguese afternoon tea is a good option if you're a cake fan although the pastry on the custard tarts we had would have been better if a bit thinner.  The service is really good & the staff are all very friendly so it certainly comes across as a real asset to the neighbourhood.",

    "text": "Guys, if you want to try the best pasteis de nata (Portuguese egg tart) in Edinburgh.  This is the only place to go.  I used to buy a lot of them from Nando's but I have stopped it as this is much much better.  OK, fine, it is not as good as the original one ie Pastel de Belem in Lisbon but it is pretty darn good.  I am a loyal fan the Portuguese egg tart here but I have to say honestly that the quality may have dropped a slight little bit from when they opened a year plus ago.  However that said, it is still the best egg tart you can find in Edinburgh.  Besides that, they also sell plenty of sweet cakes, pastries and Portuguese food.  Coffee here is good and strong, just like how I like it.  They don't really advertise their egg tarts from outside so please go in and browse around.  They do finish quick.  The best time to buy the egg tarts is about 8ish to 9am when it comes out fresh from the oven.  Nothing beats a warm Pasteis de Nata!",

    "text": "A welcome addition to 'near where I live' Casa Amiga is a great wee cafe.  The baked goods are definitely where it's at, I've never had such a delicious custard tart (Portuguese stylee)- while friends bring back packets with 5 a piece that are small, mainly pastry and leave you unsatisfied though intrigued , these mo fos are fit to burst with custardy goodness. Seriously, I dare you not to let it drip.  Meanwhile the sausage rolls are definitely making a hit with the locals and the remaining goodies at the counter look so appealing I had to take several deep breaths when I entered.   Today I had the soup: potato, kale and chorizo. It was served in a terracotta style bowl with a slice of bread and butter, talk about authentic! It was moreish and reasonably priced. And, though notably hearty, it suited the sunny weather.   The staff are charming. I didn't talk much with them as the place has a quick customer turnover and though I sat in they were always busy. It seems a family affair. For all I know it's a chain -the branded cups and excellent layout would convince you of this- but I don't think so. Also, there's more seats downstairs so if you're heading here you'll definitely get one!  The number of Portuguese clientele that meandered in, in the short hour I was there, speaks for itself!",

    "text": "On my way here today I could already taste the sweet flaky pastry and creamy custard filling of the Portuguese tart I'd been longing for and I wasn't disappointed!  I've not managed to find anywhere in Edinburgh that makes these since I moved from London a few years ago. Their wee shop is on Leith Walk, family owned and run and has a colourful interior with deli and freshly baked products available to buy. It was busy and buzzy with a mixed bag of middle aged coffee socialists, a few hippies and students scattered around.  There are tables available inside and outside,  I sat on both during my visit as it was a typical unpredictable Edinburgh day :) I ordered a flat white coffee with my tart which was actually very, very good which surprised me a bit as this place is not pretentious at all. A pleasant visit and I think a bit of treasured gem.  I was impressed... But Casa Amiga you had me at Portuguese tart!",
