    "text": "Through working in the Edinburgh office for the first time today and this place was highly recommended by one of my colleagues. So glad I checked it out.  Quaint little place with lovely, friendly staff and a great selection of sandwiches. I opted for their 'Vegan Supreme' roll and it was so good. It came in a lovely brown sub roll with seeds, rocket, falafel, sweet potato cubes, pine nuts, some sort of sweet chilli jam or relish, onions and probably some other wonderful stuff. They had some nice looking cakes and can make sandwiches/baked potatoes etc up on request too. The coffee smells like it could also be a winner. Prices are reasonable for Edinburgh, especially on the Royal Mile.   There are a few seats at the back of the shop and a few up front. I popped myself out front since it was such a nice day. There's free Wi-Fi if you need it, just ask for the code.   Prices are really reasonable for Edinburgh and how fresh the ingredients tasted.  Look forward to visiting there again whenever I'm back through. Hopefully soon!",

    "text": "Do you like stale toast with your breakfast, or dirty lettuce in your salad? Do you really love long waits for your food, especially when there is no one else in the restaurant? Or really weird and awkward service?   On a Monday morning, there was no one in the deli when we arrived. My husband ordered one of their \"Hearty Plated breakfasts\", which the menu clearly states is served \"With fruit juice, toast and leaf tea or Americano.\" He asked for orange juice and tea. I ordered one of their focaccias.  Then a number of takeout customers walked in. We watched as the lady occupied herself making their sandwiches. My husband's tea came 15 minutes later, after they had all received their orders and left.  Our meals arrived at least another 15 minutes after that. Over 30 minutes' wait for a sandwich and a standard breakfast. The orange juice never arrived. My husband asked the lady about his orange juice.  \"You have to order it,\" she said, making it sound as though it were not actually included in the breakfast and would actually be charged separately.  We reviewed the menu which declared otherwise. I took the menu up to her at the counter. \"Excuse me, so the menu says that juice and tea are both included, is this not True?\"  \"Yes, but you have to order it, you didn't ask for it.\" What? Even supposing that we had not asked for the orange juice, should you not have asked, \"The breakfast comes with fruit juice. what kind would you like?\" And when we did ask you about it, should you not have just said, \"Oh yes, I will bring you some\" rather than responding as though its absence was somehow due to a failure on our part?  In retrospect, it all makes sense-- we didn't ask for FRESH toast, so we received STALE toast. I didn't ask for CLEAN lettuce in my focaccia's side salad, so I received DIRTY lettuce. We didn't ask for reasonably efficient service, so we received slow and inefficient service.  I asked for the orange juice and she begrudgingly poured a small glass for me.  Even as a cheap eat, this place is not worth the money, not worth the time, not worth the trouble.",

I was looking for a good, simple, and inexpensive lunch, so I went in.  The soup atmosphere was cozy and friendly, and the soup was delicious!  The staff are friendly and effiecnent, and were totally unphased when I asked for a different combination than what was shown on the menu.  I look forward to returning :-)",

The waitress was very friendly, but we had trouble communicating.  I ordered one of the breakfast rolls and thought it was something different than what it turned out to be.  It didn't make much of a difference to me, in the end - I just ended up eating the breakfast meats without the bun.  The fried egg was fantastic.  The coffee was adorable, with little hearts in the foam.  Nice quiet spot for breakfast, and a nice alternative to the chain coffee shops that are everywhere.  I'd definitely stop back in if I had the chance.",

We stopped in here for a warm breakfast on the way back from Arthur's Seat and were pleasantly surprised with the friendly service and delicious food. I would highly recommend the porridge with honey - so simple and delicious. They also have sandwiches and pastries to go, if you're in a rush. This is a family-owned business and the food is cooked fresh, so it may take some time for your order to arrive but it's worth the wait.",
