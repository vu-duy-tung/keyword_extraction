    "text": "I have been to plenty of indian restaurants in my life, and taken away from many more. Sonar Gao is top 3 for sure.   An unassuming little shop run by a tiny balding bangladeshi man Sonar Gao doesn't look impressive in the slightest but god damn the food is good. it arrives when you want it, and loads of the dishes come with a side for free, like the katmandhu which comes with a free plain naan.  The menu is pretty extensive, offering all the usual fare like khorma's and such, but also offers curry dishes that are a little off the beaten path. The Chicken Zheera is a favourite of mine with a Peshwari naan is back of the net food for me. Sonar Gao's Lime Pickle is also a surprise treat. Not as thick and unmaleable as Pattak's it's easy to mix with other sauces, or drizzle on a puppadom, but still has a hell of a sour kick with a warmth of chilli.  If you're in the delivery Radius, next time you want a take away curry try this place out.",

    "text": "Mentioning Sonar Gao to my new Leith-based coworkers launched all of us into a paroxysm of superlatives. We've all been going there for years! I have never had delivered takeaway, be it Chinese, pizza, or whatever, that arrives so consistently piping hot, well-cooked, and delicious. I recommend the Special Laknavi and the Bombay Muttar Saag. Some days it can be a bit oily but last night in particular it was delicious as usual and not at all oily. It can take 60-90 minutes to arrive but it's never cold. Highly recommend. Delivered 3 curries, 2 naans, poppadoms and chutney included for 20.",

    "text": "This has been my Indian takeaway of choice for the last 6 years. The quality of the food has always been outstanding - I have never had a bad meal from here.   I can highly recommend the chicken dhansak and the chicken jalfrezi, the later of which is surprisingly spicy.   The website allows you to view the menu, and you can even order online (which I've done in the past, and have had no problems).   If I had to pick a fault, it would be that the delivery can be a little slow (45 minutes to an hour from calling), but the food is still piping hot so it's not much of an issue.",
