Sure, it's a great alternative to Starbucks but not a place I would religiously choose again and again. I suppose it all depends on whether you have a passion for coffee or not.  If not, then you'll probably just be as averagely contented as I was.",

However, this is one of my favourite places in Edinburgh to eat out for lunch. My love for it began when I went along there somewhat hungover last year with my flatmate and order the chilli chicken and mozzarella panini with a smoothie. It was heavenly! One of the best paninis I've had and a delicious smoothie. I also loved the salad accompaniment as the salad dressing was so yummy.  The thing that stops me from going here too often is the price however. It cost over 3 for my panini. I guess this is what you have to pay for such good quality, yummy food.   This place is a comfortable and cosy when it's not too busy. Last time I was lucky to get a sofa and couch with my friend which was lovely. There's a selection of daily newspapers to read and the staff seem rather friendly. On top of that, students can get a card which offers them a stamp deal on coffee.   This is a great little cafe. A favourite for lunch and only my lack of finances stops me from awarding it more stars.",

OK, that's going a bit too far. But only a bit. And I'm not saying this just because they put lovely pretty patterns on top. It's not just the coffee either, the food is good and the soup is always delicious and imaginative - cheese and potato and a glorious thai chicken are my favourites so far. If you don't like coffee, never fear! There are lots of alternatives: the best, in my view, being the apple and strawberry juice. Yum! The staff are very friendly and the atmosphere is great - helped along by the bookshelf of old books that customers are welcome to borrow while they drink their coffee. Comfy chairs too. And warm. Perfection in a coffee house!",

I love this place soooo much, I meet my friends for coffee, lunch and general meets, it is in such a location that it is easy to locate and meet someone, especially for the first time, as I have often done. They have recently moved from their location, to a bigger and brighter location, a few doors away from the Tesco metro on Nicholson street,I was very impressed with the move, as, although they moved to bigger and brighter premises, they never altered their beliefs or standing in the community. They still play the ecclectic mix of french'afro, carribbean mix of music and artwork. The staff could not be any friendlier if you paid them, it is such a great place to be and relax in, and OH by the way, they have wee tickets which they stamp, so if you buy four cups of coffee, you get the fifth free.(for example). I would highly reccomend this place for all you guys that want to meet for a coffee, have a chat, have lunch, or whatever. I support these guys all the way, and am right behind them. Anyone who wants to put this to the test, Hey, well just give me a shout and lets meet for a coffee and chat sometime. p.s highly recommend the hazelnut steamer mmmm",

There are not too many tables in there so it can be quite hard to get a seat if it's busy, it can also make it feel a little cramped inside.   It is a lovely place to get a space on a sofa and read your book. They serve tea, coffee and hot chocolate, and also soup and paninis and lovely cakes.   Every time you buy a drink you get a stamp on a Kilimanjaro card so that after you buy enough beverages, you can get a free drink of your choice.   The staff are really friendly and the toilets are kept clean and tidy.   I think this is a lovely alternative to the chain coffee shops, I really think this is a little place with some atmosphere and somewhere that is a little different.",

But bracketing the potential pet, the potential contagion, etc. and in memory of Captain Li Shang, let's get down to business. The petty qualm (or qualm-y pet) takes the form of a question: what teats bore the milk of my glass? Though this should be taken strictly as an analogy, it is tantamount to the crux: what trees bore the fruit of my scone? The answer to this question remains hazy, and I'm only capable of guesswork. For instance, raison and apricot might be a good guess, but it also might not be. I'm uncertain. In any event, far beneath the fortified layers of butter and jam I erected, there were fruits. There were delish (albeit anonymous) fruits.",

I really am a huge fan of people watching, especially armed with a huge mug of tea and a slice of cake.  It's very popular so can often be hard to find a seat and I've had to go elsewhere many a time as it's just been way too full up. It's not such a big deal as there are ample coffee shops along Nicolson Street but I'd say this one has to be my favourite.  In addition to hot drinks they also have a great selection of cakes and I'm always torn when deciding what to go for, I've never been disappointed though.  I guess the only downsize is it's modest size but if it was any bigger it might take away from the charming cosy atmosphere that it has.",

    "text": "Before you read on I am reviewing two things in this establishment. In fact I have only ever sampled two things here (no sorry actually I have also had some shortbread and that was really good as well, but, let's face it, it is not the main event) Anyway, despite having a menu that always looks and smells delish, I save myself solely for their scones and their coffee.  You see, if you have not had a Scottish/British scone you have not lived and the creations here are so far removed from the Starbucks imitations it is unbelievable. They are huge and homemade fresh everyday, served with homemade jams and jellies and 2 good wodges of butter.  The jams and jellies vary everyday as do the scones. There are 2 varieties on offer, though one is usually a traditional fruit scone. I really enjoyed their apricot scone with rhubarb jam and hey, I don't really even like jam all that much!!  The second thing I order is a coffee - yummo! (Edit - many apologies for that Rachel Ray moment there!) Really nice roast and well made.  When we were back at Christmas I was gutted that it was really busy on the first day we were back, so we left it and went down to George street to do some shopping. We passed by a place called Wellington Cafe advertising freshly made scones, so since we missed out on Killimanjaro, we decided to give this a whirl. The scones were remarkably similar, served in an identical manner with gorgeous jam. We also saw that this place had been mentioned as one of the top 10 coffee houses in the UK (by the Times I think). We left pretty satisfied and glad we had found somewhere else that maybe served Killimanjaro scones and equally good coffee.  Turns out that when we saw our credit card bill that the retailer was Killimanjaro coffee - Wellington on George Street and Killimanjaro are one and the same! Whichever you go to, you wont be disappointed!",

In fact, I don't feel right until I've had it in the morning and this place and sometimes we all need a bit of pep in the afternoon and I've gotten mine from Kilimanjaro numerous times.  This is quite a cool and quirky place that is filled with students and workers alike. Inside there's a cracking sofa that I've sat and caught up with life on and even Yelped from!  My only grump might be that it's a little expensive. However, Kilimanjaro makes up for it with their brilliant selection of coffees, teas, soups and of course, my personal favourite, their cake selection. Apparently this little coffee house has been listed as one of the best in the country too!  I'll definitely be back to the Kilimanjaro for my little bit of pep and a chill out on my favourite sofa.",

Unfortunately a lot of places in Edinburgh close at 5pm on a Sunday. Lucky then that we stumbled upon Kilimanjaro! We got some lovely tea and managed to bag the couch, which was uber comfy. The staff were very friendly and did not try to rush us or anything. We ended up spending a good few hours relaxing, chatting, and just having a lovely time over some lovely beverages. It was pretty busy, but I guess that's just testament to it's awesomeness. Will definitely be back.",

Sure I stuff my face full of fried things on the regular and wax poetic about full fat dairy everything, but I also have a cupboard full of supplements, active kelp enzymes and multi-vitamins, I wish I owned a Vitamix, I make smoothies with Manuka honey and I juice.   It is my secret shame.  Before my big move, I juiced fruits and veggies daily but haven't quite made my way to buying a new juicer here in Edinburgh. Instead, I scour the city looking for fresh juice alternatives, that can tied me over until I get my own and Kilimanjaro takes this top spot so far.  My only real complaint with this place is that it doesn't have wifi, or else it would coast cleanly into a five star range. It's a great little spot for a meeting and the food here is fresh, but filling. The coffee is good - not being a coffee geek myself, I can't speak to HOW good, but I like it. So that means it's half decent I suppose.  But the nicest surprise of this spot is that it boasts some decent fresh juice, including GASP - some greens. Green juice just doesn't seem to be a thing that's caught on here, so I applaud them for taking the reigns on it. What's more, the juice is fairly priced and seems to be juiced to order (which fellow juice geeks will know is mucho important).  All in all, it's a happy little find for my secret health nut ways and though it's a jaunt and a half away from my house, I will definitely make a point to stop in when in the hood.",

The perfect size - large enough to handle the brunch crowd, small enough to feel friendly. Big windows. Beautiful.  A fantastic assortment of vegetarian brunch choices, and everything genuinely sounded good, unlike some places where there's only one obvious item that pops out, and everything else sounds meh.  We had:   * the granola (big, delicious yogurt, piled with fresh fruit. You get kiwi!)  * eggs and toast (classic, perfect, nice thick crusty whole wheat bread, came with marmalade) * zucchini fritters with pickled sweet beets and avocado (an interesting and refreshing change from classic fatty greasy breakfast foods, and a great flavour combination).  Tea came in kettles, which was nice.  Food came out fast and the service was lovely.  A perfect brunch spot. Absolutely worth five stars.",

Some of those lemon, nutmeg, and persimmony notes that lover of lighter roasts love, but which, for this less witty tongue require a bit of milk to soften the pungency.  Doesn't embrace the chocolate, sienna darkness that I require in the morning, but a good cup nonetheless, especially if you're fond of tangier flavors.

Some other notes - it's been busy whenever I've gone, but I haven't had trouble finding a table for two or three people; it's a favourite with many of my friends, one of whom regularly goes here to study; I believe that they do take-away for some of their menu items, not all; you order and pay at the till, and then they bring the food to you; they have loyalty cards, both for drinks and sandwiches - I have one, so another reason to visit again!",

Just espresso and espresso-based drinks (ex, lattes, cappuccinos, mochas, Americanos). Which are quite good, but not what I'm looking for. (Parenthetically, I would be eternally grateful if anyone would recommend a good not-chain place for regular drip coffee in this town.)  The vibe is fun, with mismatched chairs and pleasant baristas. I went at a not particularly busy time (9:30am, when most students are still asleep) and service was still slow: close to ten minutes to get lattes and some truly divine fresh-squeezed orange juice and forty minutes to get food. Their food is excellent. I ordered the vegetarian breakfast, which included grilled tomato, mushrooms, potato scone, a fried egg, vegetarian haggis (it was like a lentil patty, tasty if not particularly evocative of haggis), and a huge amount of delicious hearty bread, all for 6.20. The quality of the food warrants five stars: I'm taking one star off for slow service and the lack of filter coffee.",

As in, if you'd like a forgettable coffee in a forgettable setting served by forgettable service.  However, what I find unacceptable is that my favourite soup, the one I look forward to (the Red Thai Chicken) tasted not just bland, but actually watered down compared to Press Coffee. I have this thing about my soup, I like the soup to be, I don't know, soupie. If I wanted a bouillon, I would have ordered it. Now I go to Press Coffee a lot, mainly because I like the staff (same as Kilimanjaro I think), the ambiance, and the coffee, but the reason I go there is my soup (notice the snotty possessive). Never-have-I-ever been disappointing by Press Coffee's Red Thai Chicken. So when I popped in to Kilimanjaro, and noticed the sign for my favourite soup, I took some home with me.  I am now a very sad Lou. Imagine me, if you will, looking misty-eyed out of the window (violin? Anyone?). You see, I thought me and Red Thai were at the very least going steady, but today I found that apparently he's just not that in to me. You see, he was watered down, a fraction of his former self. It just wasn't the same soup I've fallen in love with. Also, there was a strange piece of chicken in the soup that not only looked processed (or as if it had been snipped with tongs) it had bone in it, actual sharp bone that pierced my mouth. I took at my tongue-ring for a reason, I would not like it back while eating soup, but thanks for trying. I have also had previous experience with this place serving me some accidental gristle with my bacon, but thought it was a fluke. Apparently not so much.  I'll stick with Press Coffee, thank you very much. I'm not impressed with Kilimanjaro.  Let me go stare out of that window a little more, I'm nowhere near done pouting.",

I like coffee very much and this place offers good strong coffee for those craving for caffeine. Breakfast is very good too. They've got the typical English breakfast (or Scottish since it's served with haggis?) and a veggie option (must be pointed out that their vegetarian haggis is excellent!). They've got a good range of paninis and sandwiches (the latter served with very good freshly-made bread) and soups, which are very good. I always have the chickpeas and spinach dahl soup, my favourite. Portions are quite generous so it's a good idea to consider how hungry you are before you order. They've become quite famous in the area for their scones (with clotted cream and jam). Took me some time to try them (not a fan) and they are actually very good. A good option for dessert (though their selection is rather limited) with a chai latte perhaps.  Unfortunately, this cafe does not offer internet access (if you are thinking of bringing your laptop) but this may be a good opportunity to chat with friends and even other customers!

Now there's better coffee and there's terrible coffee but everything in between is just 'whatever' to me. So... what can a coffee shop do to be better than 'whatever'? I like coffee from the worst of the worst to the best of the best, so you can't really use coffee to sway my stars.   - Atmosphere (Coffee shop-ish) - Price (Under 2 for a small latte - NOPE) - Staff (Kindness, Friendliness and Attractiveness is a 3/5) - Food (Pretty Standard, Delicious and Not Cheap) - Ambiance (Meh)  Kilimanjaro doesn't really up it in any of these areas for me.   It's a cute coffee shop. It's got good coffee. There's douchey tweed wearing German guys in horn-rimmed glasses talking about politics. There's hippie white girls with dreadlocks and there's newspapers and board games. I don't know... just not bowled over. Staff was unmemorable. Coffee was memorably smaller than other places, but delicious.   I'll come back if you invite me, but I won't suggest it.",

The place has a pretty relaxed and laid back feel and if I understood it correctly the area is fairly close to the university. Only went here once and it appeared to be very popular, packed with people so no available seats, and it looked like the type of place where people sit for hours (perhaps students studying or just slacking). So since there were no available seats we went for a quick espresso (very good) at the counter and then ordered some beverages to go.  I had a cortado and the rest (I did of course taste theirs as well) went for the flat whites. The cortado was prepared according to my wishes so a perfect blend of coffee and milk. They use Square Mile Coffee so the beans are good and the people working here now what they are doing. Still would say that Wellington serves a slightly better coffee but the service is friendlier at Kilimanjaro. The Flat White was however a bit off - first it felt is they had too much milk (or too little coffee) and the milk appears to have been steamed slightly too much but do hope that it was just one mistake.",

Everything else I've had here has been great, and as I've had to pass it everyday for the last few months I've faced mighty temptation.  Kilimanjaro's is very close to the Edinburgh Bargain Store, and a pretty cosy place to sit. Unfortunately, it could be bigger which means there's difficulties finding seating at times. The cafe is really cosy with a large leather sofa by the till, and old wooden chairs throughout. I'm a big fan of their soups, which they keep interesting; there are daily specials such as red thai and wild mushroom. However, a visit to Kilimanjaro isn't complete without trying one of their scones. And no, it's not a proper scone experience if it doesn't come with clotted cream! Morbidly, I always think of blood clots every time I'm plastering some on my scones...",

However, cracks are beginning to show in the facade.  Letrs start with the good stuff - there is a huge amount of coffee's to choose from, as well as food, soups and various cakes that are all very tasty and morish.  However, maybe it is because of the hype inflating Kilimanjaro's ego, but the prices are sky high, especially since it re-opened a few stores down from its original position a few months ago. Even with these prices, the cafe is always full, meaning service can take a while, but you usually have absolutly no chance of a seat.  Its a shame really, because this place really does do great coffee and food, its just the insane prices and lack of seating that drags it down.",

Whether its the great coffee or the free wi-fi or it's convenient central location that does it is impossible to say, however I do know that trying to find a seat in here is very often impossible.

    "text": "My favourite coffee place in town to grab lunch and a quick latte. I love their food options - great soup, the avocado chilli jelly bacon sandwich is delicious. Some of the reviews mention their pure espressos aren't too good and are too acidic. I can't say I've ever had a plain espresso here, but as far as their other coffee options go, I've always been very pleased. They have great lattes, and are always willing to substitute for non-dairy milks. They have different options different days, but usually good ones like rice or oat milk, not just soy milk (which I hate). My biggest complaint would be that there is no wifi. I come here often to do work, and this is always very frustrating. It is purely for this reason I am giving Kilimanjaro a four star review instead of five. Please get wifi! It's standard at all coffee shops and even at most restaurants these days. Especially when you are right next to the university and as such the majority of your customers are probably students. Hopefully they can finally get wifi, and then I can update to a five star review. Other than this, it's a great and tasty place to have breakfast or lunch with a latte!   I'm amending my previous review. Went in today and ordered a decaf latte. I did not get a latte. I was given an Americano. I asked the barista if she had given me the wrong drink, as there was no oat milk in my \"latte\" at all. She insisted it was a latte, and didn't offer to fix the drink. Quite disappointing. I would rate this particular visit one star.",

    "text": "Here's the deal. If you have the word coffee in your name I'm going to judge you on the quality of your coffee.   Kilimanjaro was one the first 'third-wave' coffee shops in Edinburgh which proved that there was more to coffee outside of gingerbread lattes at Starbucks. In the years since then Edinburgh has seriously upped it's coffee game and unfortunately I don't think Kilimanjaro has kept up.  I ordered a flat white and a bowl of soup which took a bit too long to come. I don't mind waiting for good coffee but the impression was that they just had a backlog they were trying to rush through. You may not be able to judge a book by it's cover but I think its fair to judge a coffee by it's latte art. Passable but not perfect. The coffee had decent flavour and they use good beans but milk was over-heated for my liking. It's definitely a step up from Starbucks but lacking compared to the serious coffee places in the capital, such as Filament further up the road.  Overall I feel like the place is a little bit tired and in need of a facelift. I don't think it has changed much in the several years since I last went in and could do with some modernisation. The furniture and fittings feel a little bit outdated but not necessarily in a trendy hipster way.  I will give it credit for being open late and if you need passable coffee after 7pm there isn't much choice. Their sandwiches and scones looked like they might be decent also.",

All the food and drink was delicious. The clotted cream and the jams were excellent, the scones were fresh, and the drinks were well made. The table was cosily tucked up in a corner, and we had access to the day's newspapers as well.

Apparently the latte was alright, whereas the espressos were almost undrinkable due to their excessive acidity. I mean, you can be wrong once, but not on three coffees in a row, and coffee is supposedly your speciality .

    "text": "Spent 6 months living in Edinburgh in 2013 and the place was great. Really embraces the city's under appreciated cafe scene. They have fresh abundant options. I appreciate a good full Scottish breakfast and the cafe's Kili breakfast fits the desire. It's a great place for a group under 3 and it's well priced. A good stop for a meal.   Update: I was there again this past week and it was just as I remembered",

    "text": "Went to Kilimanjaro Coffee for breakfast - it's been ages since I've been there and I wanted one of their scones... I was there early, before 9.30 and there were only a few customers in. What I saw, I liked. Mainly that the scones were BIG, and they had different ones: fruit, date or cheese, each served with a different kind of jam.  So I had a large cappuccino and a fruit scone with bramble jam. The coffee looked beautiful, tasted great. The scone tasted good too, however the butter was too cold and hard, impossible to spread evenly on the scone. I hate that when this happens in cafes. Yes, I know - first world problems and all that, but still. The bramble jam was ok-ish. I would have preferred a nice raspberry jam though.  Bill for a large cappuccino and a scone came to 4.85.   ps. note you can opt for clotted cream as well, for an additional cost.",

Will definitely be back here. I liked the look of the cakes too, though I didn't scoff any on my first visit.   Only downside? Very, very busy at lunch time and practically had to shout in order to have a conversation, ooft! But pick a less hectic time of day and you're probably on for a winner.",

What to do for an hour, we'll let me tell ya something. I heard and read about this coffee stop from other Edinburgh Yelpers, so wondered what all the fuss was about.   I'd not tried a veggie breakfast for a fair while literally a veggie breakfast for me recently had been beans and cheesy toast. But wow, the guys at Kilimanjaro Coffee knew what exactly should go from the plate to your face.  Veggie haggis, spinachy type greens, soy sausages or similar, toms and four rather generous slices of whole wheat seeded bread and rounded off with a egg. Soy coffee for my caffeine fix and neatly serviced very quickly before the shop got too busy, all for under ten quid.  Cool.",

    "text": "I'm super-finicky about orange juice, but this morning as I bimbled aimlessly along the street, I had a bizarre and sudden craving for a big glass of the stuff. Boy, was I lucky to be on Nicolson Street when the craving descended: I definitely hit the right joint.  This might seem an odd thing to rave about in a coffee shop but... the ORANGE JUICE, people. It tastes of ORANGES. When they say freshly squeezed, they absolutely mean it, and you only pay the same as you would for stuff from a carton or bottle in a restaurant. I'm seriously thinking of going back again just for another glass of the stuff.  For those of you less inclined to be citrically overawed, there are of course other details. The service was jovial but unintrusive. The bacon was jolly good too. There's also more seating within than you might expect from a glance at the frontage; it's compact, but not crowded. At first, I was going to say that my pot of tea was fairly generous too, since it did me two and half cups, but the cup was actually weeny. Nonetheless, it's that juice that sticks in my mind like a jug of sunshine. Tasty, tasty sunshine.",
