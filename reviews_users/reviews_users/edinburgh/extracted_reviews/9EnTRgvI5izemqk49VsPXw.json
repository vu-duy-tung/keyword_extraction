It is my super charging food, my dying wish and last rite, my desert island dream.   Pizza can be screwed up. In New York there are three joints I gorge at and the rest are for suckers. This is on my Edinburgh list. Don't let the look of the place discourage you- if ninja turtles are fine in a sewer...  Yes so I did compare this place to a sewer. But think of it rather as an adventure. And it's cheap. Plus, he will make you a large size if you ask him. He's sweet.",

The pizza was so delicious and the owner Pedro was such a sweetheart. Loved the pizza, good conversations and the hospitality!!! I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I wish this was my local pizza place because I would visit non stop. The pizza is amazing!  The Three Coins is a hidden gem of Edinburgh. While staying at the Edinburgh City Hotel I decided to try this place after reading other yelp reviews and I was not disappointed! The store front may not look like the most glamorous from the outside, but don't judge this book by it's cover.  As soon as I walked in I was greeted by the owner Pedro and he made exactly what I asked for from scratch! Nothing is pre made here - he even cuts the peppers to order it's so fresh!   My only complaints was the pizza was a little thin, so during my next visit I asked if we could have a thicker base which ended up perfect!!!!! Second time around was honestly one of the best pizzas I've ever ate.  I ordered half and half each time, chicken and peppers on one half, ham and pepperoni on the other + extra cheese. For a  12\" pizza it cost 8 and 8.50 for a thicker base. 10\" is also an option, I think it costs 5 or 6. Each time I shared half with my girlfriend and we both wished we had more.  A whole pizza for one would be the perfect order.   Sicily native Pedro is one of the most lovely store owners I've ever met. I loved talking to him, the second time I brought my girlfriend along just to meet him. His store has been around for 28 years I believe, beating away local competition that only care about the money (look across the street). Pedro is all about keeping his customers happy and it's no wonder he has 5 star reviews. He even shook my hand as I was leaving during my first visit, and when I returned for more pizza he remembered me and expressed how happy he was I returned.   The Three Coins is now a must visit every time I visit Edinburgh! I can't wait for the next time I visit my new friend Pedro to order some delicious pizza.",

Pizza was delicious, lovely thin fresh dough base, perfect amount of sauce and cheese and very generous with the toppings!  The service was very friendly and so fast! Great value for money too compared to the big chain pizza companies and a lot higher quality! I will definitely be returning very soon, just need to decide which toppings to try next time",

    "text": "Whenever I feel like pizza (which is often) I immediately think of paying the Three Coins a visit. This is my favourite pizza place in Edinburgh. Actually, I'm going to go as far and say that it's my favourite pizza place full stop. The fellow who owns and runs the shop makes the dough himself and makes it daily (it's homemade not a frozen base!!)  Three Coins opens at 5pm and stays open late most nights.   Unfortunately there's not a place to really sit and enjoy a Three Coins pizza.   I (may) have a usual: chicken, pepperoni, red onions, jalapenos and garlic sauce.   I highly recommend that if you are in the Tollcross area and you find yourself hungry for some 'za that you visit the Three Coins.",

The pizza is thin crust deliciousness.  Note: there's just one table! But others were doing take-out so we sat down. Right before the pizza came out Pedro brought a lit candle to our table and turned the lights down in the whole place to give us a more romantic dining experience! Pedro, the pizza, the place - - all fantastic! It's less than a ten minute walk from the grassmarket so get there!",
