    "text": "Edinburgh has a seriously amazing food scene. If you're a foodie, then you'll be well served in the city from tex mex burritos to authentic stone baked pizzas and burgers with a donut bun to the high end Michelin starred success of Martin Wishart every type of food you'd ever want is available. So when I heard about The Table I knew this would be a welcome addition to the Edinburgh dining scene.  I love the concept- one chef, a sous chef, a marble counter over looking an open kitchen and ten seats for one dinner seating an evening. It's a simple concept but a genius idea that gives the whole experience a bit of an underground pop dinner party feel if pop up dinners did five star fine dining. The place is chic without being hipster and the chef who not only cooks dinner in front of you also plays a wonder host throughout the evening.  I've had the pleasure of going twice now, both visits booked months in advance as availability is limited due to their small number of seats and huge success. It's 70 for a 7 course dinner, no allergies or veggies catered for. This might irk some people but I get it, in order to have a flawless service they need to serve ten amazing plates of food seven times over and having to cater to specialities would be a challenge. However they do free BYOB (as many bottles as you'd like) and according to their website they consider doing a lunch seating for over 6 people if you contact them to arrange.   Both visits have been amazing with seriously good food. The highlights for me have been a scallops in broth and poached egg over white asparagus from my first visit and a sweet and savoury cheese course and cherry and olive oil dessert from my second visit. I'd have to write a novel to comment on each course I've had so just look at my photos and know that each plate of food was some of the most amazing I've ever put in my mouth (and I've done the Michelin starred thing twice)! For the price I think the food you get is a total steal as you'd likely pay twice the cost for this meal anywhere else.   So just go, the only way to understand how good The Table is is to just go and have a meal there. Book now though as there aren't many seatings left for this year!",

    "text": "If you have an open minded approach to eating and you can actually book a seat for this place, then I highly recommend going! At 60 per person, it's not for the faint hearted. We ate a 7 course tasting menu and they DO NOT cater to dietary requirements. You CAN however book the entire place if you have 9 other like minded people who are happy to eat to your dietary restrictions.   I think we ended up having 9 plates of food including a little amuse bouche at the start and petit fours at the end and also a mini pre dessert. The portions are well sized. I managed to finish every course and left full but not stuffed.  Each plate is beautifully presented and they talk you through each plate before you eat it. As it's an open kitchen and there's only 10 seats, there is the chance to ask questions and speak to the chefs which I really liked.  There were some interesting things like freeze dried powdered foie gras which my palate was a bit confused by, but as a whole dish, it did come together if at first I wasn't quite sure. This is not a place for the non food adventurous!  I love that they're making fine dining casual, there was great banter between courses and throughout the evening.  Other reviews have deemed it worthy of two Michelin stars, I've personally never eaten at a '2 star' establishment so I can't comment about that, but the food was definitely as good if not better than some of the '1 star' establishments that I've eaten at in town.  It's also BYOB with no corkage fee, so you can spend as much or as little as you like on booze. They do have soft drinks/tea/coffee/sparkling water for sale as well but serve tap water as standard.   This place definitely is not for everyone. But if you're a foodie and have the budget, try and get booked ASAP!  (I've been debating between 4 and 5 stars as the food was excellent, and I totally understand with only two people cooking, it's very difficult to cater to dietary requirements & especially for coeliacs they can't guarantee no contamination but it seems unfair that so many people can't enjoy their food!)",

    "text": "My simple one sentence review of The Table is it is phenomenal. You should go book a table right now. Seriously. RIGHT NOW. Don't even bother reading the rest of the review. You can't get a weekend seat in this place until 2017. There's no time to lose.  If you do need a little more convincing here's my play by play of the evening. The evening started off with me arriving at 6:50 (service starts at 7pm) where the door was closed. They don't open the doors until bang on 7pm. I found it weird that we had to stand outside and wait even though the reservation email was very clear about being on time. I'm sure if it was the winter months or pouring with rain they would probably let people in a little early.   When you get in you find a seat at the bar (make sure to get the first seats as you go in that's where the action happens). Sean and Keith are the only two members of staff. Sean is head chef, he creates the dishes, does most of the cooking and Keith does a bit of everything else.   It's a seven course set menu with an amuse bouche and some petit fours. Every single course was fantastic but a couple stuck out over others.   There was a dish that used foie gras in the strangest of ways. It was a pre-dessert that was a mix of sweet and savoury. It's was very much a \"marmite\" but one of the most interesting parts of the menu.   More traditionally the Saffron Risotto was beautiful and homey. It was like a perfect fluffy mac and cheese.   Other than the food you have Sean and Keith who make the whole night personal. They keep the night flowing and the conversation buzzing. We were speaking to the other diners at the other end of the bar. It felt very much like a dinner party that is being catered for by professional chefs. The atmosphere is better than any restaurant i've ever eaten at. I left feeling like I'd made friends with people I only met a couple of hours earlier.   I got all this for just 60 per person (going up to 70 at the end of April) and the greatest thing of all is the BYOB with no corkage, so you can splurge on wine without the 500% mark up.   I think this is the greatest dining experience i've had. It's seriously better than any 1 michelin starred restaurant i've ever been to. I'm not sure if they will get a star in the guide for 2017 but i'd be pretty surprised if they aren't featured at all.   I will definitely be back at some point later in the year.",
