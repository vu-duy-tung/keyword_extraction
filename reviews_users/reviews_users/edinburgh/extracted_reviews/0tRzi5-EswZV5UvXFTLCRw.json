    "text": "I'd been eager to check out Norn since it took over from the Plumed Horse location earlier this year and hearing a lot of good things. It's a high-end restaurant that does some stunning food, and it was fantastic.   You don't really get a choice on what you eat here for dinner, only how many courses; 4 courses for 40 or 7 courses for 65 (which is comparatively good value). I think if you come here you really owe it to yourself to go all in and get 7 if you can, because you'll want to try everything on offer.   The menu is pleasingly unfussy. It comes on a little folded up bit of paper simply outlining the ingredients e.g 'mushroom, turnip, cheese'. You don't have to spend the first part of dinner on google trying to decipher gastro food speak.  Each plate of food was delicious and beautifully presented. The chefs will come out to the table and talk you through the dish, and even some of the story behind how they were conceived. The mushroom and the lamb dishes were highlights, and the buttermilk dessert held it's own against the rest of the meal. We didn't go for the matching wines but were talked through the wine menu to help pick a nice bottle. We also went for a cheese course to share (an extra 10) and did not regret it.  The venue itself is relaxed. It's surprisingly bright and well lit; it's not a cosy dinner by candlelight kind of place. It's simple, minimal and not too fussily decorated; the food is the focal point here. It was a little cold inside, especially sitting near the door, but improved as more people came in.   It can book up well in advance but for a great dining experience it's definitely worth it. I hope to come back for lunch which at 20 seems like a bargain.",

    "text": "Norn seems to be the restaurant that everyone in Edinburgh is talking about at the moment, so I knew we just had to go along for dinner when we were in town for the weekend. We'd booked back in July so had no issues getting a table but I believe that's changed now and you'll might have to wait a while for a booking.   We arrived right on time for our booking and were shown to our table which had a good view into the open kitchen. The decor is very basic, stark and minimalist - I quite liked it as there's no frills or pretentiousness. It actually feels quite casual and the staff were all chatty and warm, so a nice relaxing vibe for a Saturday night meal.   For dinner, there's two options - a 4 course menu for 40pp or 7 courses for 65. Seeing as we weren't sure when we'd be back, we went for 7 courses. There's the option of matching wines but I just had a cocktail and a glass of wine as I went as I wasn't sure I could drink that much (...again, anyway - we'd had dinner at the Kitchin with matching wines the night before).  The menu is very simple - doesn't tell you much about what you'll be getting but we aren't fussy eaters and don't have dietary requirements so just went along for the ride. Firstly, we were treated to a bonus course of a carrot dish with oyster which was a light, refreshing start to the meal. I liked how all the dishes were introduced by a different chef. The bread and butter was absolutely delicious. The bread they served is made with a wheat which is only milled off the coast of Scotland with a nicely whipped butter beautifully presented.   So onto the tasting menu - 1. Mackerel, tomato, squash, onion. Plump pieces of fish and tangy tomato was a delicious start and this is probably one of my favourite dishes of the night. There's no OTT presentation here - just perfect crockery and relaxed plating.  The next dish was my other favourite purely because it was a real surprise. 2. Halibut, cauliflower, cobnut and nut milk. I'd never order this because I hate cauliflower but actually, the cauliflower in this dish was delicious! Finally. I love being impressed by a dish so much that it changes my opinion of an ingredient.   The rest of the dishes (see pictures attached):   3. Venison, celeriac, sorrel 4. Guinea fowl, cabbage, barley, corn 5. Beef, kale, turnip  We couldn't resist the addition of the bonus cheese course here even though I was already bursting!  6. Plum, buttermilk, fennel 7. Bramble, chocolate, bay, lemon  I won't go into details about the rest of the menu as I think I'll exceed the word limit. But I do have to say that this meal is the kind of meal I feel like I'm constantly looking for - unusual combinations of flavours, impressive taste and lots of surprises. That's what makes a good meal for me. There was only one dish for me which wasn't totally perfect which was the third one as I think my portion didn't have enough celeriac (or apple, whatever the small cubes were). But that is the most minor of complaints in an otherwise perfect lineup of dishes.   Notes:   * the menu is seasonal and I believe it changes at least weekly. There's no menu on their website. As I said, we don't have dietary requirements and pretty much eat everything, so we were happy to be surprised. I'd recommend calling them if you do have a particular requirement/question.   * it's a casual restaurant - I was wearing a nice dress but with sneakers as I had sore feet and I didn't feel out of place.   * they also offer a really great priced lunch menu - 3 courses for 20 which I really want to get back to try, now that I've been and seen just how good it is.",

    "text": "Norn has picked up a bit of a buzz about it, with some glowing reviews from local and national press.  On the basis of this meal I can totally see where they are coming from - this is a seriously good restaurant, and is reasonably priced for what you are getting (especially compared to some of the other high end restaurants in Edinburgh).  First things first, it's a pretty chilled out experience.  The feeling is pretty relaxed here, with some seriously good staff who make you feel at ease, and who are attentive without being intrusive.  It's also a pretty relaxing space - definitely not fancy, and small enough that it gets a good atmosphere when full but with enough space that you don't feel like you're right next to the other tables.  Special mention for the tunes - Abbey Road, early The Who, Them - lots of classic 60's stuff at a decent volume!  For what you're getting, the tasting menu is a bit of a bargain: extremely tasty food at 40 for 4 courses or 65 for 7.  We went for the full menu, plus added a cheese course on because we are gannets!  I honestly can't fault any of it - 2 fish courses (after an amazing carrot amuse bouche - not something I ever thought I would say!), 3 meat and 2 dessert that all worked perfectly together, and did a hell of a lot with not a huge amount of ingredients.  Like any good tasting menu, it highlighted ingredients that I may not have ordered normally (cauliflower, fennel in a dessert) and showed how good they could be, and showed a good deal of invention - who knew that sweetcorn and barley were a winning combination?  Part of the fun of this is getting the chefs out of the kitchen to introduce each dish - it's a great way of asking about what you're getting, and the guys are good fun with it all.  The wait for a table here is totally justified - this is a brilliant restaurant that is well worth your time.  You may have to book in advance for it, but it really is worth the wait!",
