It's an Irish theme pub, so there are the obliatory 'My Goodness My Guiness' signs all over the place and of course, they play lots of traditional music to keep craic-seeking punters happy.   The house band is great at exciting a crowd, with lots of rousing, danceable songs. The fiddler is a real performer and regularly mounts the bar, striding along it and leaving tourists in raptures.   There isn't much to keep you coming back though. Come two nights in a row and you'll feel like a film star, but only 'cause you're Bill Murray in Groundhog Day.",

The bar staff are very friendly though and they serve you rather quickly. Not a popular place with myself, but nothing to do with the place, i just prefer things with cheesy music :) Unfortunately this place could be shut upto another year now due to a fire in the building next door.",

Everything from Irish road signs, newspapers, Gaelic/rugby stars and of course the familiar old Guinness posters adorn the walls which can feel a tad claustrophobic if stared at for long enough. They've even gone so far as to place a real Telefon box against the wall as you walk in. No half measures here. Staff seems to be all Irish made and up for a giggle. A highly popular city centre bar at weekends and for Irish matches (of course). Queues are a regular occurrence but once inside and with pint in hand, the craic surely does await and things can get quite boisterousthe emerald isle's not so far away after all!",

The vibe here, with the wood floors, music, and crowd energy is great.  The food may not be the strong suit, but the overall score is good. The drinks were served fast as long as you order beer, and especially during the Fringe, you'll have a great time with great people.",

If that's not your scene, there are a couple of tables with stools, a small room in the back, and lots of regular socialization happening near the bar. It can get quite loud to have conversation, though.  Student-discounted drinks are 2-3 GBP, and regular drink prices are pretty typical. Bar is busy, so order two at once;)",

Since it's redesign due to the fire next door it's lost much of it's \"old edinburgh\" charm - however it's now a much better space for the number of people that they like to cram into the bar. They have a room out the back which you can book and that's actually a pretty nice space.  Beer - a very important thing..... but not something that they do well here. It's pretty dull - Guinness is the pint I'll be drinking in this pub I think. They have it in cold and EXTRA COLD.  All in all - a good atmosphere for the rugby and the band they had on afterwards were not too bad also. The singer had funny tattoos and was wearing a silk waistcoat and a wife beater which basically makes him either a legend or mental.",

I've heard good things and had a few laughs here so it I have it pegged as a decent spot...  However, the bar staff in here have never been nice to me. I always get the cold shoulder and very little banter. Now, I'm not the type to chew your ear off but a friendly chat while the pint is poured is expected in an Irish bar! At least from this girl!  Most recently, the barman slagged my 'North Dublin accent' ( think ned-ish) and let me tell you something about Dublin girls, if you're not going to banter with them you do not get to slag them!  It seems nice and I'd like to go a bit more but there are much friendlier bars about, who will accept my 'North Dublin' accent!!",

Since then Finnegans Wake has been through rather a lot.  A couple of years ago I remember waking up to the news that Kushi's (my favourite Indian in Edinburgh) had burnt down and the buildings either side were ruined by smoke and water damage. One of those was my favourite club in the world, The Liquid Room (which has now reopened and is EXACTLY the same - hooray!), and the other was Finnegans Wake.  So it's nice to see that both those places are back on their feet. And Finnegans Wake is just the same - it's an Irish bar that has a live bands and sports and Guinness and stag parties. It's a fun place. Everyone's your mate in here. Not a place to go for a quiet drink, but great fun if you're in a big group.",

Alas, the bar, full of Celtic memorabilia and coloured in green decor and wooden sitting areas was no more.   However, this week I entered the new, reincarnation of the pub, and it has gone under a radical transformation. The old pub, full of history and memories is gone, replaced by a pub which is full of wood and fits into the categories of Irish themed bars that are alike in every major city in the world.  Instead of the bar being in the middle, the bar is now on the right hand side, looking modern and fresh. In the middle there are large high tables for groups, with padded seated areas on the left hand side of the bar. Further seating is in the back.  The pub has live music every week it claims, but even though it has this, I feel with this refurbishment, Finnigans has lost its old looks and atmosphere. The bar is lacking that individualistic character that makes pubs what they are.   The place was quiet and empty; the staff were new and obviously will improve with time. It was quite bland compared to the bar before the fire.  Its due a visit though, after this long closed, it will be visited by people who often paid Finnigans a visit. So raise your glass to the memory of Finnigans of old!",
