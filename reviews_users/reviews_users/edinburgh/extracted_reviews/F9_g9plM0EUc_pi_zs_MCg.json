The service was outstanding--the servers were attentive and the level of hospitality was superb. I had the vegetarian kurma, which I loved. It was delicious and the spices fragrant and just...wow. If I lived here, I'd eat at this restaurant all the time not just for the food, but also for the phenomenal service.",

It has a good menu with dishes to offer for both those who prefer delicate, subtle tastes and those who like their Indian food hot and spicy.  Pataka's portion sizes are good, and their food presentation is excellent; all the dishes I've tried have been full of flavor; the chicken was moist and perfectly seasoned; all the other meats I've tried were tasty and had an excellent balance of spices.  The prices are very reasonable, especially for Edinburgh; about the only negative I can think of is that the booths are too small, and feel somewhat cramped.",

I want to say the flavor of the food was particularly good. You can tell they use fresh quality ingredients. I had the chicken Vindaloo. The quality and quantity was superb. My wife had the lamb Pathia. Naan, rice and samosas. I highly recommend Pataka. Very good.",

It was quite busy, so consider booking ahead.   The restaurant was clean and comfortable. They have it decorated in a Rennie Macintosh design that is spot on.   It is no wonder it ranks so high on Trip Advisor for all Indian and also all restaurants in Edinburgh!!  Will be back again!",

    "text": "Pretty good, and at an affordable price.  Stopped in for lunch here with a friend, after I had told him that I missed my mother's home-cooked Indian food. I'm a Bangali, so it's often harder to find food that tastes closer to what we eat as a family. I have to say, this place hit pretty close to what I was expecting, which was a nice change,  The lunch menu had three different options for the starter and the main each, and at 7.50 for the meal, it was pretty decently priced. (The portions were just the right amount of food to fill us up but not weigh us down too much to walk back homewards.) The food was tasty and clearly not the typical generic Indian food you can get around here, so good points in my books, definitely.   Not a five-star review just because the menu options given for the lunch meal were a bit limited and kinda similar to one another in my opinion, but I guess what can a cute little place like this do on a weekday afternoon without ending up with a ton of waste?  I definitely want to stop in for dinner some time soon to try out more of their selection. I've looked at their menu online, and it looks like a fantastic variety, with plenty of Bangali food to remind me of home.",

    "text": "A decent Indian (Bengali) dining experience with a reasonable price for the generous amount of food.   We were a party of two on a weeknight with some time to spend.  Ordered a vegetarian Biryani, Okra, Chicken Bhuna, and some garlic naan, paired with the house white (a fruity affair described as \"quite nice\" by my non-connoisseur partner) and lassi (drinking yoghurt level, definitely not as thick as I would prefer it).  The staff are very friendly and courteous, and the food is quite pleasing. Each of the above dishes is well prepared - e.g. okra maintains a slight crunch, vegetables retain a mix of their own flavour and the main spices. There is a pleasing selection on the menu for vegetarians and non-vegetarians.    One main reason a 5 is not given is my high expectation, having visited eastern India. On the other hand, I forgot to request original spiciness. This would be quite tasty to European palates. My partner and I have sort of agreed to a 4.5, complimenting our sum total experience with this place.",

I started off with a couple of papadums which were lovely and crispy and not too greasy and followed this up with a chicken Rogan Josh, which was just under 6 and had accompanied this with a naan bread which was well sized. The meal was delicious, the Rogan Josh sauce was full of spice and flavour and the chicken was lovely and tender. I normally get a carry out from Pataka, but the decor inside is nice, if not a bit simple.",

Prices are moderate, and both the food and drink menus are extensive.The restaurant itself is cosy and modern, but still shows its traditional roots.  Staff are friendly and quick, plus a quick chat with our waitress revieled that Pataka has featured in one of Ian Rankin's Rebus detective novels - which was a nice suprise.  Patakas is an excellent restaurant, with good food and nice surroundings.",

The menu seems to focus in the individual chefs specialities - and these are mostly unique and tasty offerings.  I opted for the Mangsho Roti, a spicy lamb dish accompanied by a couple of light and fluffy chapattis. As my fellow diners agreed, Pataka's dishes seem to have a clean and fresh appeal that plenty of Indian restaurants seem to lack.  A little out of town, but with plenty of nearby bars to accompany a visit to Pataka you should be settled for the settled and content for the evening.",

Inside, the restaurant is Charles Rennie Mackintosh themed - offering classy dining. There is a number of high-backed black booths for more intimate eating (so I'd suggest requesting one of these). I'd also suggest sampling as much of the food as your tummy can take! However, they do offer a home delivery service, so remember and grab a menu on your way out and you can continue working your way through their lovely dishes from the comfort of your sofa. PERFECT!",
