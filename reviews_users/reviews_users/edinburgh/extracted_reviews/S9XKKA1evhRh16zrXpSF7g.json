Pepper steak is juicy *and* peppery, and comes with a decent crust. I may be slightly biased by deprivation of such pastries in central Germany.  Not much seating in the store-front, although you would want to savor them inside since they'll get cold quickly out.",

It's huge and was the perfect late night snack for a long days of walking around Scotland looking at Castles and being a tourist . The shop is small so it's for pickup and carry only. They have a huge selection of meat pies that come in moon shape as well as your typical pie shape. Close to closing time they will run out of pies. I really wanted to try the haggis pie , which has haggis and a layer of potatoes and turnips baked with it aka tatties and nips!",

A pound and a half for a large Cornish pasty that's still crisp and flaky?   It's the True opposite of health food, but you knew that when you clicked the word 'pie shop', now, didn't you?   My one regret is that it's quite filling, which means I'd run out of steam before the end of my second hand-sized pie.   I'm not local, so my filter for 'health food' might be a bit off, but this definitely isn't somewhere you can eat frequently unless you're also training for a marathon or something.",

My husband tried one that was a hotdog wrapped in essentially tater tots. I was not impressed. Neither was he. HOWEVER, the meat and veggie pies were really delicious and the crusts were flaky so overall WIN. You can't beat the prices either. If you're in vacationing on a budget, you'd be a fool not to come here for some seriously decent food on the cheap.",

With each pie at approximately 1.3, you can try as many pies as your heart desires. I wish my stomach was as big as my eyes.

The best bit is the price is good (a little more than Greggs for a better pie) meaning that on a winters day a warm pie is a no-brainer as opposed to a sandwich.  They open at 9 and offer bacon rolls alongside the pies for breakfast and close at 8 on a weekday (a bit later on the weekend), so if you want some late-ish food that hasn't been fried the Piemaker is a good choice.

Piemaker proves once and for all that pies not just have to be greasy, fatty, prosthetic pastry packets of meat slop. No indeedy not, Piemaker offers fresh, creative pies using good ingredients. It offers a range of vegetarian pies too, for a mere pittance. Okay so the food can still be a touch on the salty side, but the difference between this place and Greggs or even the popular Auld Jock's Pie Shoppe (which don't get me wrong is still decent), is quite something. Maybe I've always just got unlucky in these other places, but Piemaker really does offer good quality snack food for cheap.  I used to pop into Piemaker on my way back from the gym when I lived in London Road. To make the long journey more pleasant I would pop in and order, very often, the mushroom pie. Scrumptious!  So when I think about it, maybe my admiration for Piemaker stems more from my dislike of similar places, which sort of lowers the standards. Either way it offers a great lunchtime or snack alternative.  Recommended!",

Their sausage rolls are also great with nice fluffy pastry and good quality meat for the filling.  All their pies cost only 1.70 which is an amazing deal considering the quality.  I usually go for a chicken and ham pie along with a sausage roll which provides a tasty, filling lunch every time.

Aside from pies, they also serve a variety of smoothies, baguettes and hot subs which look really appetising!   The counter initially is quite reminiscent of another favourite of mine, Greggs. However, it's obvious they've got a little sumn sumn going on in the back as well, to be able to provide all they serve on the menu! Super cheap, and a nice place to just grab a bite on the run.",

It was a grotesque scene. I took a chomp, grease and puss just pored out onto the counter followed by a splat of pink.  I dropped the rest of it (a greasy pie casing), left, and never went back.

They serve all kinds of pies and rolls.   Both sweet and savory, what ever tickles your fancy.    I have stopped in here a couple of times.  The staff are super friendly and helpful when I am questioning them and asking for their opinions.   I have to say their Scotch pie is my favorite.  It is some kind of minced meat pie that looks like a mini quiche.   The savory pies are like a mixture of a pot pie and a hot pocket, for those folks from the states.   These are like I would imagine Sweeney Todd made minus the human part.   The pies have a great flaky light crust  like a puff pastry.  Truly melts in your mouth.    The price is super cheap.  So for a pound or two you get to have a great portable lunch.  I really wish they had these in the states.    Stop in if passing and grab you a few to go.   They even have some vegetarian and vegan pies.  If you aren't hungry at the time you are passing...They sell them frozen as well so you can take them home to enjoy.",

The two most popular pies, the sausage roll and the Scotch pie, also happen to be the cheapest. They will you run you for about 60 and 90 pence respectively. They have a larger assortment of calzone-shaped pies on the back counter. I tried the hot pepper steak and the sausage roll - both with a can of soda cost only 3.60. The meat was tender and flavorful and the buttery crusts were flakey. It was like eating a gourmet Hot Pocket (no offense, because I love Hot Pockets). The meat and potato pie is served as a more traditional double-crust meat pie and is just as tasty. This is a great place for a quick bite if you're in a hurry. I would definitely come back, just to try all the other pie filling flavors!",

In fact, the only reason I'm even writing this is because I was talking about some of my favorite places in Edinburgh, and while there's some much \"nicer\" food spots that I remember, the first thing I will always think of are the bacon baps.  My wife (girlfriend at the time) and I stopped in here for a light lunch, and were somewhat limited by the fact that they only took cash and we only had a few quid on us. However, we had enough for a two bacon baps, and they were fantastic. We sat down, ate, and went on our way.  After a few minutes of walking, I rerouted us back to the apartment to grab more cash so that I could go back and get another sandwich. The people working laughed a little bit, and then loaded it up with around twice the usual quantity of bacon. I was ok with this.  It ruined the \"light\" part of lunch, but I'll remember this place fondly forever, and always try to stop back in when I'm in Edinburgh.",

They also have VEGAN PIES!! And not just one or two vegan pies. They normally have a SELECTION OF VEGAN PIES!!!   Now, pies are not gourmet food. Pies are for when you want a quick, low-priced, warming, portable snack. Which quite a lot of people often do, so it's normally busy. The staff are remarkably efficient and amazingly cheery. I think it's because they are making so many people happy through the medium of pies.  I've been here a few times, but sadly any further detail escapes me. I'm normally just so giddy with excitement at the prospect of a vegan pie. And it's quite possible that I may have had a few beers by this point in proceedings. The only other notable feature is that there's normally quite a lot of flaky pastry on the floor, scattered by drunk pie-munchers. And that the punters tend to be very very happy with having a pie.  That's it. Did I mention there's pies?",

It's a small place with freshly baked personal size pies priced around 2 a piece.  Favs:  1. chicken mushroom pie (flaky pastry and creamy filling) 2. haggis pastry (gotta try haggis when in Scotland. Interesting taste - reminds me of pate and went well with the puff pastry) 3. Mac and cheese pie (definitely get this one)",

Steak and ale pie had good flavor and was served with a crispy top and bottom, but some of the steak was more gristle/fat than meat. Sausage roll was exactly what it should be. All the pastry dough was cooked perfectly...crispy and super flaky. Best for take away as the seating inside is limited and it is very warm in the shop. Wide selection of meat, veggie and other options for a quick bite.",

Steak scotch pie was my favorite - was simply large chunks of steak mixed with savory brown gravy inside a pastry shell. Chicken and mushroom pie was a close second, basically just chunks of chicken and mushrooms with creamy white sauce inside puff pastry. Pizza roll is worth checking out also, tastes like a much better version of a hot pocket  They also offer turnovers on the sweet side - I sampled both apple and cherry, and they both blew me away. One of these is also more than enough for two people.  Prices here are dirt cheap, most pies are between 1 - 2.50, and one pie will fill you up. I only regret not being ale to try everything on the menu",

I refused to leave the country before actually have meat pies and wished I came here from the start.  Between two of us, we had 3 pies and they were substantial.  We ordered a shepard pie and 2 others that had beef in it.  It was just divine and it was really cheap.  The guy behind the counter was really nice too and he was chatting with the regulars.

Steak and ale was just slightly above average. I did not like the scotch pie. The customer service from the man behind the counter was absolute trash. For whatever reason, I guess I rubbed him the wrong way from the moment I spoke to him. He was utterly rude with every word out of his mouth dripping with animosity. I gave this place three stars because the pie is simply slightly above average. The lack of good customer service and hostility will make sure we don't ever come back.   My husband and I are nice and kind people. If we experience poor customer service, more often than not, we are understanding that some people just have bad days. In this instance, we sat and ate at the window and watched one customer after another come in and was greeted with an entirely different and more kind attitude by the man. For whatever reason, his unwarranted animosity was just geared at us.    Bottom line? We won't come back, that doesn't mean you won't get treated differently. Food is just average.",

You're on Cowsgate Road, and at that moment you're standing directly below South Bridge, which is where you actually want to be. I'm just passing that tip along since \"a friend\" made that mistake! :)   In my week in Edinburgh, I've been to The Piemaker twice. I went with the Scottish and macaroni pies the first time, and they were good - certainly worth the price. Went back for the Vintage Cottage pie and was absolutely blown away. I only have two days left in Edinburgh, but may have to make a third trip to this place.   Doesn't hurt that each pie is generally 2 or less. And, the man who packed up my pies both times was quick and friendly. If I lived in Edinburgh, I'd be here at least once a week. Don't miss it!",

There is no other way to explain their divine flavor.  They are very fresh, flaky, and filling. The meats and vegetables inside are tender, and the sauces rich and flavorful. We especially recommend the Chicken and Vegetable, and Steak Scotch pies. The service was fast and friendly. The prices - insanely cheap!  Literally the only downside I can come up with is that the inside is a little small. However, just rethink that as cozy! If I were lucky enough to live in Edinburgh, I would be partaking of this food of the gods ALL the time! And at these prices, I could afford to do so. Cheers!",

I decided on the classic beef pie and my husband ordered the sausage roll. Our two pies plus two sodas cost us about 3 pounds- super affordable. The pies were absolutely delicious. My beef pie was flavorful with a very flaky crust. Loved it. Great option for tasty and affordable meal!",

The weather is already bad, and the sky is dark at night. I would out in more effort if I were them.  The food is edible. I got the sausage roll and mozzarella basil roll, and neither were fantastic. Very oily, and the sausage roll had a mushy texture. Perhaps I just don't understand what it should taste like, but I would not eat it again, so it doesn't matter.

I wish I could teleport to Edinburgh just for these. They also have vegetarian pies but I didn't get a chance to try them.   I saw they had a few sweet pies.

I walked in with no expectations, but I'm definitely glad I tried it.  The various pies are the things to get and I ended up getting the meat pie. Simple, cost-effective ($1.10?), and tasty. Honestly, it felt like chicken pot pie meets asian dumplings. It has the consistency of a baked pastry on the inside with a sort of meat ball on the inside.   I was pleasantly surprised by this place once I checked it up on Yelp afterwards. This is good for a quick snack or a meal!",

We hadn't intended to stay, but my partner went to throw her coffee cup away anyways out of respect for them. The guy then told her she wasn't allowed to throw away her cup in there. She wasn't going to protest, even though that was odd, but he went on to insult her anyways. He starting talking about how they hate Starbucks and anyone who goes to Starbucks. He said apparently we love Starbucks, so we supported all the awful things the coffee shop apparently does. We've never been treated so rudely, especially after just having paid someone. We said we'd wished we'd known he was going to treat us that way before we paid him and he simply said, \"well now you know.\" Disgusting service. I don't care how he feels about Starbucks, but we are not Starbucks. We're paying customers. I suggest taking your business elsewhere and not supporting such an awful establishment. I only hope he doesn't represent the rest of the staff. Truly disgusting service.",

Yes indeed, I dont know why, but that got to me.  And really, the feeling of euphoria afterwards didn't deminish - i was throughly impressed by Piemaker - I was expecting it to be a but scruffy, and generally a bit on the less savory side of things, but I was wrong.  This place is no Simple Simon the Pieman, the pies are all freshly made, delicious and actually have a decent filling in them - unlike some other chain store places. Staff are a bit grumpy, but for how much you talk to them, its not really a problem.  I really liked this place, and while Im not generally a pie kind of person, I did enjoy what I ate, and next time I need a pastry infuion, I will be heading here.",

    "text": "Have been going to Piemaker for a good few years but to be honest I don't really know why. Ok, on the positive side they have probably the broadest range of pies in Edinburgh and are of a good size, reasonably priced with reasonably priced cakes and muffins of a decent size too.  The negatives, I've never had a fresh pie out of the oven from here, it's always been lukewarm (I don't want it warmed up in the microwave that ruins the pastry!).  I usually go for the chunky vegetable with tastes a bit bland and sort of like a chunky cup a soup  in a pie, (also the pastry is really thick and doughy.) Also I had an absoloutely terrible vegetable soup from here which had  overcooked vegetables and soup that reminded me of the soup I used to get for free out of the vending machine at work. So, yeah why do I keep going? Not sure. Probably because it's conveniently located, and you get a decent amount of food for not a huge amount of money and you can sit in. However, it could be so much more. They seem to concentrate too much on having a large range of pies rather than on quality.  By far the best meat pies I've had recently have come from humble, local butchers. Just decent solid, meat filled pasties, bridies, nothing fancy, no 'moroccan vegetables' Or Cajun chicken's, just well seasoned, well filled pies. It's not rocket science surely. Quality ingredients, simply cooked = good pies, simples!  But I'll probably be back, because you can't sit in in greggs.  I've given it 3 stars, but  would have given 2.5 if I could.",

We had never been and walked past it many times so we finally decided to stop by after all the great Yelp reviews. We were not disappointed!   The place was packed as it was lunch on a weekday and it is near Uni so we got our delicious pies to go. We are vegetarian and, at first, I was afraid they wouldn't have much of a selection for veggies but I was surprised to see they did - much to our delight!  We ordered the Mexican veggie, Thai curry veggie, and one that tasted like a chicken pot pie but with no chicken.   We thought 3 would be enough and we were wrong - it was way more than enough! We got them to go and went over to the museum and ate our delicious pies on benches while staring at beautiful pieces of art. We only ate 2 of the 3 pies because they were so filling and saved the other one for later.   Great prices that can't be beat! 3 pies for less than a fiver!",

After every single performance at 1pm i would head down to Pie Maker for cheap, satisfying and tasty lunch time sustenance. It is brilliant! An actors dream. Pies are handheld, very filling and can range from 85p to about 2. My lunch in London comes to about 5 daily for similar qualities!  The range of pies they do to is fantastic. Everything from your classics such as steak and ale, cottage to Balti pies, as well as more sweet pastries. All are made fresh in store as well and very nutritious. The Haggis Pie was quite the stand out for me.  Not only that, Pie Maker do great deals - for instance 'Spend over 2 and get a free donut'!  The staff are brilliant and remember you from day to day (something you could never expect in London)  THE PASTRY IS BLOODY INCREDIBLE!  Pie Maker was a staple part of my Edinburgh Festival and helped make up one of the best experiences of my life.  I am so enfused by them that i am going to offer to build a website for them for free (which they so sorely need!)  People must know about the best pies in Scotland!",

But it's pretty difficult up in Edinburgh unless you want to spend loads getting pub food, or going to the carbon copy bakeries - Greggs etc. Problem solved. Piemaker, just next to Frankenstein's is a great little pie shop. The pastry is good and fluffy, not like that sad stuff that just folds in on itself that you can often get. And the best part is that they use real meat, not just chewy dog food which I'm sure I've had many times before.  There are both savoury and sweet pies, but my personal favourites have to be the sausage rolls. Wrapped in a double layer of pastry and seasoned with a good level of spicy pepperiness, they are the best around. As they are open late as well, you have another alternative to pizza paradise when walking back from a night out. Especially good on a cold Edinburgh winter night, when the beer jacket doesn't quite cut it",
