I also had chilli chips with cheese. Chilli is really nice, has a little bite but not too much.   I ordered for ASAP and the app said 20:20, order came just after 8pm - bonus!",

    "text": "The Burger was un edible , the Philly chese steak which was promised with mozzarella came with a crappy processed liquid american style cheese and no bell peppers . The shake was disappointing  as was the mozzarella sticks and jalapeno poppers. The chili cheese fries were decent and the only tasty thing besides the coleslaw. I will not be ordering from here again,",
