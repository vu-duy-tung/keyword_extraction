    "text": "An excellent addition to the constantly expanding gourmet burger scene in Edinburgh. The difference between BRGR and some of the other places- the prices here are amazing! From Monday-Friday, all burgers are 4, rising to a still amazing 5 at the weekend. On top of this, there are beer bottles for 2 and great price milkshakes too. Oh, but what about the quality, I hear you say. You get what you pay for, right?  Wrong, the burgers here are really good quality- the ingredients all taste good, portion sizes are great, and the variety on offer on the menu is impressive. I had a delicious burger involving haggis, whilst Mary had a vegetarian burger made of halloumi. Both went down very well, as did the delicious fries we shared.  Really impressed by BRGR. Will definitely be back!",

I received the vegan burger, but it was missing the vegan mince and extra salad, and I received the vegan nuggets but was missing the fries. Other than these mishaps, the food, as always, was excellent and I will order again in future.",

    "text": "The food here is pretty good considering it's relatively low price point compared to surrounding burger restaurants but be wary that even though it's advertised as \"4 Burgers\", you are likely to spend more than that after including chips and a drink with your meal. The problem comes in the form of spotty service from the staff. Most members of the staff are really kind and helpful, providing top notch service, however just like the saying goes, bad apples truly ruin the bunch. On our last visit, our server Ana seemed like she had no care in the world for any of her customers, acting in a very rude manner for the entirety of the dining experience. Most of the time she just flat out ignored us leaving us sitting around wondering when we would be helped.  TL;DR If you're willing to overlook the relatively spotty service that seriously needs to be addressed by management in the form of proper hiring and training practices, the food here is quite tasty!",

I would later find an answer to that in London, but I wont go into that here. This Burger is solid. No frills on this Hamburg, just meat and cheese and maybe a sauce or two. Would visit again.",

Staff was friendly and quick, even when busy.   However, I will never again endorse the business model of serving everything on disposable kitchenware while in a sit-down, table service restaurant - burgers wrapped in aluminum foil, tap water in plastic cups, salads served on paper bowls with one-use forks, fries in paper bags. It's tacky, unnecessary, and absolutely awful for the environment.",

The chips were pretty good, although I couldn't taste any rosemary and they could've been saltier. The burger was nice, if a bit dry. Nice juicy piece of chicken though.   Overall, a cool, relatively cheap place to go, but I've had better burgers.",

I got the bleu cheese with bacon burger, and the meat was clearly hand-made, not from a frozen patty. Nice size, large, tasty. I don't know how they can do these prices, but I will keep coming as long as it stays that way.  The place plays recent pop/rock music, and the service is friendly. They even have kids menus. If you're from the States, it has a Five Guys feel. The colors are the same, and the fries even come out in a white paper cup.",

Chilli cheese fried are good, but not good match with burger, next time I will try regular. And the prices are super cheap for Edinburgh restaurant. Many students and local are visiting the place, you can not miss it!",
