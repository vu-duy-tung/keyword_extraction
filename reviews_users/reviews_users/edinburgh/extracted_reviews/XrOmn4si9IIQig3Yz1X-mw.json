    "text": "Just plain outstanding. Deserves six stars on a five-star scale. Consistently warm welcome from the French chef and his Scottish wife. Great value market menu at lunchtimes (8.95 for two courses), good value evening menu and a specials board. Children's play area and outdoor dining area at rear. Cassis is all about the cooking. Fundamentally French, but using Scottish produce and with the occasional Scottish dish. Superbly executed. Not easy to find, this is in the basement of the Salisbury Hotel. As a result, no views, but the internal decor is very pleasant.",

    "text": "Wow I love it when I find a place really not expecting much but discover it offers much more than you might expect (if that makes sense?!).  We absolutely needed somewhere with a garden or play area to accommodate 5 very active kids and someone suggested Cafe Cassis on Salisbury Road. Most of us mistook it for the big place opposite the Commie Pool but it's at the other end past the Synagogue.   Anyway, it does have an excellent garden for kids and very welcoming service. Nice layout, small bistro style with a decent Sunday brunch menu (with kids options). Something really good and French going on in the kitchens which makes it a cut above some competitors. Nice Sunday Roast for 9.95, various good lamb, chicken dishes. One issue is very short on veggie options.  I had a really good quality rib eye steak, well cooked and presented, at a decent enough price.  Also good bread and butter pudding (fellow diners enjoyed the cassis sorbet).  Didn't know about this place, bit out of the way but worth a visit, and the garden makes it a real asset in the nice weather (if or when that returns).",

    "text": "My wife, 14 month old son and I ended up here after I read an email from T***advisor about pubs in Edinburgh, then started wandering around that site.  This caught my eye, so when another reservation fell through, this popped into my head.  The restaurant is underneath the Salisbury Hotel, just off Newington Road.  There's a small car park outside the hotel.  The restaurant notes itself as being child friendly, and we certainly experienced a genuine effort there - definitely one of the most friendly in Edinburgh.  There is even a play area for kids at the back of the hotel, although we didn't try it out this time.  The decor inside is nice and clean, and at lunchtime on a Sunday there was a nice buzz.  This place clearly has built up a regular custom, and all of the staff were chatting away and really helped make the place feel welcoming.  The menu is very nice.  A nice selection to choose from, with some tasty dishes, just different enough to interest, not too strange to scare.  I had poached pear on gingerbread covered in cheese to start, and my wife had mussels in a very tasty sauce.  Our mains of confit duck (again, very good) and beef (tasty) were nicely presented and good sized portions, well put together.  Our son's risotto was also very tasty.  For desert, we didn't stray too far from safety, with a tart tatin and a creme brulee.  Overall, it's a very nice restaurant doing some great food with truly engaging & knowledgeable staff.  They cater very well for kids.  I'll definitely be going back, sooner rather than later.",

    "text": "You don't have to be the most observant person in the world to notice that this part of Newington has more small hotels than is really necessary, and that there's usually very little difference between them. Which is why I think Gabbro really makes the Salisbury Hotel a cut above the others.  It's got a big garden area where you can make the most of the rare sunny days in Scotland were it's warm enough to eat al fresco, but the inside is just as gorgeous with all the dark brown leather and mirrors giving it a modern vibe.  A lot of the food on the menu sounded quite predictable, which is why I only gave it 4 stars and not 5 - things like fish & chips or risotto that you'll find on menus everywhere. But they do offer one or two really quirky dishes such as the watermelon, strawberry, feta and black pepper salad that I had for my starter. Not only was it extremely tasty, at only 3.95 it was great value for money.  Due to its location, tucked down a little side street off Newington road, not many people know about it. But it's definitely worth a visit.",

    "text": "My mom and I had lunch today at this little restaurant. The food wasn't great; my mom liked the coffee she had, but the mushroom risotto she ordered wasn't stellar. The butternut squash soup tasted entirely of rosemary (no hint of butternut squash, other than the color, could be detected) and was served so hot that I had to wait at least ten minutes before it was cool enough to eat. Admittedly it was the soup of the day, so if you visit you're unlikely to be subjected to it! The service was very friendly, it had the polished decor of a nice restaurant, and the atmosphere was pleasant. Overall, we enjoyed spending time together during the meal, even if the food wasn't perfect.",
