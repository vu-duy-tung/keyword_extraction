The standout of this location..... is the staff; they are some of the friendliest people I've ever  met period.... creating such a warm and family atmosphere that I've only experienced a small number times in years of dining out.",

The staff is a bit serious but you can crack a smile from them if you start a conversation. If you are around Edinburgh you should try this family owned restaurant.  It is probably 10 minutes from the station.",

    "text": "If you are looking for a casual Italian dinner in this past of town then consider Mamma Roma. With most mains around 10 you get a tasty meal for not a lot of money. It is *casual*, not fine dining, but sometimes that suits the bill. The staff are friendly and speak to each other in Italian (if that is important to you!). The house red is distinctly drinkable and the service is fast and friendly. We walked in here on a whim before going to Wicked and ordered a pizza & a pasta, with two house reds and a coffee. The food came out in around 10 minutes and was fresh and tasty. The bill came to 30 and was provided swiftly, knowing that we were going to a show (from pleasant small talk when taking our orders). They do pre-theatre and lunch deals too. A happy smiley place - I'd go back!",

    "text": "A three course lunch menu for under 7 is always a winner in my book, and the fact that Mamma Roma's is an Italian restaurant sealed the deal for me.   This is the type of place that I love; the type of place that feels like you've just come for lunch in the kitchen of a big Italian family. We were warmly welcomed even though it was absolutely mobbed when we went, and seated pretty much straight away. The lunch menu has restricted choices, but quite a bit of variety.  I had the delicious Minestrone for starter, it was delicious with plenty of pasta in it, and then the lasagne for my main, piping hot with creamy cheese sauce...delicious. I could hardly fit a desert in, but I did my best with a portion of lemon sorbet which was really refreshing and ended the meal perfectly. All our courses were served in good time, and even though the place was busy we were attended to really well, and asked if we were ok or needed anything about three times.   I would 100% recommend the lunch menu in here, because you'll be hard pushed to find a better lunch deal in the City.",

I'll get straight to the food, first trip I had one of the specials, Mezze Lune. Little pasta pockets stuffed with goats cheese in a creamy tomato sauce. Yummy.  Second trip, we couldn't get a table. Waited for 20 minutes then left.  Third trip I had Fieleto Diana, which was 18 but they gave me like half a cow served with a sweet onion sauce.  This place is pricey, but you're paying for the extra effort they put into the food.",

There was only one other party at the restaurant when we got there, though it may be busier with playhouse traffic. As for food, the prices are reasonable, the food was good (but nothing great or unusual) and the service was fine. The decor and music in the restaurant was a little cheesy. Though the food was good, I don't think I would waste my time going back there again as there are plenty of great restaurants in Edinburgh to go to instead.",

The menu contains most of the popular Italian dishes, however, most of them come in small postions, especially the starters, and have bland taste due to improper cooking. Perhaps the management wants to get by thin and buys the cheapest ingredients possible. On top of that, the prices are True rip off for the quality you get.",
