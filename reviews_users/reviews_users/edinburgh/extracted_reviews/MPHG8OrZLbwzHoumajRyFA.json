    "text": "If Pizza Mafia was located anywhere other than the absolutely desperate Princes Mall you'd have heard a lot about it, by now. Their pizza slices are tasty and cheap, and the service is very friendly. Worth a visit and very handy for when you getting on or off a train at Waverley station.  Overall, we said: \"if you're looking for quick, tasty and cheerily cheap in the city centre, you will be amply served by popping to Pizza Mafia. I was heartily impressed with the herby goodness of their pizza slices. I'll definitely be back.\"",

    "text": "Pizza Mafia is situated in the Waverley mall on the approach to Edinburgh Waverley Station. 2 massive slices of pizza and a bottle of water for a fiver. It wasn't too bad.  But the pizza was not the best pizza I've had. The cheese was too greasy and salty, the tomato was not all that tasty and the crust felt fried as opposed to baked. I must also admit, I was eating from this place less than a week after the pizza off, so my taste buds may have gotten used to a higher level of quality.  The girl at the counter was friendly and courteous. However, that alone and the competitive pricing is not enough. The quality has to be there. I don't know, based on this experience whether I will return here again.",

The Pizza had great hallmarks however I could tell both slices had been sitting in the air for a while as they were dry.   With nicer service and fresher pizza, this could be a great place to go!",
