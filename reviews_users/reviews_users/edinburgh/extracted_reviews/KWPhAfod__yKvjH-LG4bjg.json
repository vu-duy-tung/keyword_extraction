At 3.80 the ramen portions are small, but there is free green tea available, a variety of individually wrapped sushi options and fast service. So far I have had both vegetarian ramen options-the hell (which is super spicy, even for my crazily spice tolerance) and the miso. My friend took some sashimi with edamame beans and enjoyed it. The sushi on offer looked fresh and inviting.   The space is cute but relatively small. More of a place for a speedy lunch.   Upon leaving the chef took a photo of me with a polaroid camera and stuck said photo on the wall.",

But this time I was pleasantly surprised and had a fantastic experience.   So the atmosphere. It is tiny! But at the same time it feels like a ramen bar with the bar stools and eating against the walls. It's cozy, cute, and allows for creativity. YEah you can post on the walls and draw and whatever comes to you in the moment.   The food. It's really good. Ramen and maki is usually misnamed given that there's not much maki and sometimes no sushi. But ramen it does have and it is good. I appreciate how you can have a half size or a full size depending on how hungry you are. The full size is like a nice bowl size of ramen to fill you up. By the way they have a Hell's Fire Ramen and its super good in flavour and spicy is a nice level of heat and burn and delciousness. Be wary, it builds up. But don't worry the miso ramen is a great way to cool down the taste buds.  Vegetarian? Vegan? Don't worry they have tasty options for you! Most of their ramen can be vegetarian or vegan so no need to fret!",

Our server only brought out one ramen bowl, gave us the wrong sushi set 20min later, and forgot about the dan dan ramen so that came another 10min later. Unattentative and no utensils or even water for our seats. Service alone I'd give it 0 stars. As for ramen itself, the chefs bowl was pretty decent. Chasu was good, noodles were a bit too soft for my taste, but broth wasn't too salty. Dan dan ramen wasn't bitter as one reviewer posted, actually more on the creamy sweet side. Still not bad, just different. The sushi on the other hand was definitely worth getting. It came from the main road location though as they have an employee ferry orders back and forth for sushi. Not a big deal, but if you want better service I'd say go to the one right near the intersection on Nicolson street, which may only have sushi, but they will probably ferry over the ramen if it's on their menu. At the least your server may be better than ours",

We were invited to help ourselvea to the sushi on offer and take them with us up to the till when we were ready to order. We had the salmon nigiri and the dragon roll, both were very delicious. I am a massive fan of soup noodles and was very excited for my tonkatsu ramen. The broth was delicious, though I could have done with a bit more meat in my portion. The staff were very friendly, he took a picture of us in the end to put on the wall with a small message.

    "text": "We thought Maki & Ramen was so good the first time we went that we decided to go there again the last day of our 5 day trip to Edinburgh.  1st trip: We came for dinner on a weekend and snagged the last couple of seats along the wall. The server chick was very friendly & we ordered tonkotsu ramen with a side of skewered pork yakitori. The ramen was incredible, the soft boiled egg was cooked perfectly, and the yakitori was flavorful and tender. While we were there we saw one of the chefs flame cooking something and the server told us it was another type of ramen (sorry I forgot the name, it might have been called burnt soy?) so we decided to come back and try that one next time.  2nd trip: we came for lunch on a weekday and noticed the entire staff was different than last time. This time we were offered complimentary green tea (last time we weren't) and I ordered the tonkotsu ramen again with egg and my husband got the flame finished ramen whose name I forgot. This time that ramen didn't get the flame treatment though disappointingly (booooo) and it turned out that it was pretty greasy. Maybe the flame thing makes it less so. My ramen was tasty though yet again although the egg was undercooked and some of the egg white was still runny (gross). There were also college kids at the table near us watching Japanese game shows on their phones at full volume. That killed the ambiance a bit.   All in all I'd say it is a great place to try while in Edinburgh, although there could be more consistency. I'd go again if I was in the area, and it is walkable from the royal mile.",

The sushi sits right at the door and looks a treat even if you just peer in the window. And while I ordered to go the staff were super friendly and we talked over a couple of the free green teas while my food was being prepared.  My meal to go was a tiny feast: pumpkin croquettes, gyoza, prawn and salmon sushi, dan dan mein and yakitori teriyaki chicken. It came to about 15 and every thing was perfectly portioned except maybe the yakitori, could easily eat 5 of them!   Over all it was fast, fresh and filling. Just what a lunch should be. Will definitely be returning.",

The menu looks different to previous reviews and I didn't see an option for half bowls or free green tea, but the waitress came over with water without having to ask, which is a nice touch. We ordered octopus balls and salmon sushi set to share, really lovely salmon, and the tonkotsu and chilli ramen bowls. Both were gorgeous, noodles cooked amazingly as was the pork belly. Chilli ramen is pretty spicy so beware, but there was chilli oil on the table if you need to add. Good value. Can't wait to try more.",

It has post it notes that people have written on, you eat at a bar shelf which skirts the wall (which is great if you're alone). Your implements are arranged in front of you and green tea is free.  The kitchen is open plan and you can see the chefs at work (not Japanese, if that makes a difference?) .  Sadly the bowl of tonkatsu ramen I got was not quite so good. Firstly it was a fairly stingy serving on all fronts  for the price (8 pounds)  The broth itself was fine but nothing miraculous. There was a single slab of pork on top and a lonely pair of green leaves floating nearby.  The noodles themselves were disappointingly like instant noodles. Larger bowls for more broth would be a big improvement.  Service was ok, friendly enough but not overly so. Go for the vibe and the ok food but if you've tried ramen in Japan or elsewhere lower your expectations. They also offer sushi.",

Make sure you stake your claim before leaving the restaurant by doodling something on a sticky note or just signing it to add to the collection on the wall.  Good economical choice, and a great alternative to the ubiquitous Fish & Chips entree found everywhere in Edinburgh.",

    "text": "Out with my friend and in the mood for something noodle-y.  After consulting my phone, we ended up here because it was one of the few places that was open, and it had the word Ramen in the title. So that fulfilled the basic criteria.   From the outside it looked like it could go either way. It doesn't exactly look like a place that has put huge amounts of effort or money into modern branding or decor. It's simple and feels quite home-made. It's a very small intimate room with a couple of long bars with tables along them. The menu consisted of bits of paper sellotape to a wooden chopping board. I was hoping that this was a sign that food was their top priority.   Thankfully the food was good. I had a very nice bowl of gyoza ramen. On a cold, rainy day, it was exactly what I wanted. At around 8 for the 'full size' portion it was a good size; I don't think I would have wanted anything smaller unless I had some other things to go with it. Green Tea was available for free which I don't drink it but my friend seemed to appreciate.  If you want to embrace your artistic side then post-it notes and pens sit above the bars, and the walls are plastered with little drawings and messages. It was a fun little diversion while we waited for our food and made it more memorable.  In the end I was charmed by this place and I definitely would like to come back and try some more food. It's small and quirky and quite fun with some good food. If I was a student I'd probably be in here a lot.",

    "text": "One of the few places you can get ramen in Edinburgh that has recently opened - though it is a small space (not for big groups!!).   Compared to ramen I've had elsewhere, the broth and noodles are very nice though the pork is a little too overcooked and too lean for my taste.   The place of course specialises in maki (sushi rolls) as well as ramen. But it turns out if you order sushi, it's made down the street in a place called Maki Maki (from the same owner) then hand carried down the street to be served to you in this restaurant! A bit odd and makes me wonder about its hygiene. But hey... Food is good!  Definitely a place to come back... If you can find a seat!",

I ordered the salmon set, but the staff there made a mistake and gave me grilled set... But they were so nice that they made a new dish and gave me some of the shrimp in grilled set to me. The salmon set was actually pretty delicious! Very fresh and tasty. I loved that they put a tiny bit wasabi in the rice, which made the sushi much more tasty - and it's quite authentic way to made sushi, to be honest. In addition, the salmon set had about three salmon sashimi, two salmon sushi and four salmon & avocado sushi, and it only cost 8.8. I bet it would be way more expensive in any other Japanese restaurant for these things.  The atmosphere there was quite nice too. The posts and on the wall and fuji films reminds me of all other Japanese restaurant back in Shanghai.  One surprising but funny thing: we were provided with a menu in Chinese, but the staff there can actually understand what we ordered...haha",

Ramen selection is decent -- not amazing (though I may be biased as I've had ramen all over the States before coming here) but pretty good. Egg doesn't come with the basic ramen so you'll have to add it on for another 1.50 in addition to the 8.95 the ramen costs, but my total still didn't break the bank. Service is friendly, if a little slow. A decent option for those in the Edinburgh area looking to get their ramen fix.",

    "text": "Thanks Yelp, for directing me towards a cheap but awesome ramen place! :) I brought my friends to this ramen spot to warm up after enjoying the outdoor Christmas festivities in Edinburgh!  First of all, the place is easy to find. It's tiny and pretty underrated looking but an awesome gem to discover!   It's small and cozy inside, and we were lucky to go in before it got super busy, so we managed to snatch 3 seats just for us.   We were very hungry since we were munching while walking about but we wanted to eat regardless, so the fact that they have half portion for only 4.50 made us SUPER happy!! Good job Maki & Ramen :)   I ordered the miso ramen broth and my friends had the beef one. We all added an egg with it which was an additional 1 I think.   My miso ramen was delicious! Very satisfying and flavourful. I absolutely love savoury broth during a cold day, so it really hit the spot for me! My friends loved their dishes too seeing as they slurped it up within minutes! And that egg though!! Soft and melty on the inside, hard boiled and well seasoned on the outside! Perfection!  The staff members were coohl too. Chilled out and in a good mood. I especially liked their music playlist because well, they played a lot of soundtracks from animes Hahahaha *enter geek mode*  Anyway, loved it! Cozy place, delicious ramen, cheap and nice staff!! Really really wish they had a branch in Glasgow cause I'd be there all day err'day son",

    "text": "Deciding on where to go for dinner before going to the theatre was a bit of a challenge. I'm allergic to fish and the friend I was going with is vegetarian and gluten free, oh and was on crutches so couldn't walk too far or up or down stairs easily.   Maki and Ramen however managed to deal with all of our dietary (and time) requirements in a relaxed friendly manner. The seating upstairs is in the traditional sushi bar style with long counters and condiments on a rack. They also provide post it notes for you to doodle on and add to the very cute collection along the bar.   The menu is simple but provides a good variety of things. There is a good range of sushi and maki, six types of ramen and lots of side dishes including vegetarian gyoza. The sushi was freshly prepared to order and depending on where you sit you can watch it being made. Something that was being made while we were eating involved a blowtorch and unfortunately also fish or I would have asked what it was to order it next time.   The ramen was super tasty and a half portion was big enough to have with another side dish. The only minor thing was the noodles were a bit hard for my liking but it still was good.   Even though everything was prepared to order we had plenty of time to try the coconut ice cream moche, served with raspberry sauce. Yum!  The service was relaxed and it took a while to get the waiters attention at times but for a quick dinner it was great and only 30 for two of us including green tea and deserts. They only take cash (and need to put a bigger/more obvious sign up saying so) but there is a cash point at Tesco round the corner.",

Tasty, spicy and 'hot, hot, hot' After (well more during while) I tasted my Hot Pork belly Ramen with a soft boiled egg, I seriously considered moving in to the area as close as possible to this place. Just so I could have an excuse to be there every day.  Even when I cook myself I cannot make my ramen taste as wonderful as these chefs do it. There was no need to use any of the condiments, bar a little soya sauce. Just right.   The place is small, dinky. It resembles a Japanese street food 'corridor' with high bar stools. It seats around 10 people if pushed, but The food is swiftly served and, because it is so tasty, quickly devoured.  I don't know if they do take away, but I did see bento box offers too.  We had a fun time reading the menu, the post-it notes on the wall and we even had out picture taken for on the wall.   I'd be hard pressed to find anything remotely similar outside the streets of Japan!  Long may they stay where they are!",

(I'm serious) Smooth chewy Ramen, roasted half fat and half meat pork belly, fresh vegetable topping, roasted black sesame. The pork also melted in mouth mmmm!! I find my perfect Ramen!! In addition I order pork Gyoza, Tariyaki chicken. Oh and a Hell Ramen for my hot spicy wife. Btw, the hell ramen is not western spicy!!! So be warn.  They do sushi but have no chance to try that yet, but Maki will see me a lot. Extra points for service and atmosphere which I can't write anymore in one review.",

It feels a little like eating in a sardine can, but that somehow adds to the charm of it. There are post its all over the walls, the vibe is very laid back and though it is cash only, it makes up for it with being BYOB friendly. All in all, a good start to the evening.  With Caz H as my cohort in crime, we shared the grilled sushi and I had the vegetable gyoza and a half order of the Hell ramen. Now, i've been craving a great ramen place for a LONG while and Maki & Ramen gets pretty close to the mark. The broth was tasty and the pork belly in it was yummy, I just thought the noodles were a teensy bit overcooked. However, i'd happily take down another bowl in a heartbeat, so it really didn't sway me away from the dish.  I'd pass on the gyoza next time around but I really enjoyed the grilled sushi. All in all, i'm a little jealous this isn't closer to my house next time I need a ramen fix and if you're in the area, it's a good choice for a quick meal!",

    "text": "I had a short stay in Edinburgh last month. This place is a hidden gem near the royal miles if you crave a bit of East Asian food especially Japanese ramen. It is located near university of Edinburgh so most of the customers are students and you can expect the price to be reasonable as well. Small but cozy. Good for one or a small group of people. Lots of ramen options. It is a good option especially when it is freezing outside.",

This place is super small but super cute with bar seating for about 12. The server was relaxed and welcoming as I pulled up a swivel chair. The walls are decorated with post-it notes full of doodles and messages from previous customers. This is a really fun idea, it gives the place a personal feel and something to look at while you're waiting for your food!  On offer is good selection of traditional ramen as well Yakitori and sushi dishes. I go for the spicy beef ramen with a soft boiled egg. Coming in a just under 10 this is not too bad as far as Edinburgh prices go. The place is BYOB but they offer Japanese drinks and teas too. It is cash only.  My food comes quickly and I am very pleased. I want to dive it in but it is too hot! The broth is wonderfully spicy and flavourful. A healthy portion of medium rare beef tops the handmade noodles, sweetcorn and greens. My eggs is oozingly soft boiled. I am in ramen heaven and I finish every bit of it!  I'm definitely going to be back to sample the sushi and I want to try the pork belly ramen. Perfect on a cold Edinburgh day!  Cheers, A x",

    "text": "Incredible ramen shop very near to Old Town and University of Edinburgh. It can get busy but going right when they opened meant we were sure to get a spot. The shop is quite small on the top floor, with bar style seating and only 2 tables, however there are a few more tables downstairs to increase their capacity.   Staff were very nice, helpful, and funny. Free green tea and water waiting for you at every seat is a plus! They have a good number of ramen options including classics and some new twists. We ordered the Hell Ramen and Miso Ramen. The Hell Ramen was predictably quite spicy - but perfectly so, right at the point where it was difficult to eat but still enjoyable, with the spice a serious component but not drowning out the rich flavor. The pork was *perfectly* done, tender and delicious. This was 5/5 ramen.   Unfortunately, the Miso ramen was a big letdown. It was watery and unremarkable, and really didn't live up to it's potential. It's hard for miso ramen to stand up to a rich pork broth but this ramen didn't even try. 2/5.   Miso ramen issue aside, the experiance was overall nice and I would love to return and try some of the other dishes.",

Again noodle was a little bit softer than I prefer it.  Toppings included vegetables and shredded chicken which went great with the noodles and broth.  I then ordered another half bowl of the miso ramen.  I think the miso flavour is there but I think it is under seasoned.  I had to add a bit of soya sauce just to pull out the maximum flavour.

It was full so they sent us around the corner to Maki and Ramen and I'm soo happy we found this place.   It's been soo long since I've had a nice big, homely bowl of Ramen so I was really looking forward to getting stuck in.   It's a small, but perfectly formed restaurant that takes me back to my time in Japan. Stools and high tables along the side with a few booths for groups. Real canteen style. The wall paper was the neon signs of Tokyo.   Free water and Green tea and a great selection of other drinks at really reasonable prices.   Spicy miso and soy on the table which is so lovely to have as you'll pay for the spicy miso in most other places. The menu was just perfect for me! Ramens, Goyza, sashimi, sushi and even matcha icecream and mochi balls for desert for 1!!  I wish I could express in words how much I loved this place! But I did leave a message on a post-it note on the wall of restaurant like many other visitors.   We had the salmon broth (like ramen but with dashi base) with some octopus balls to start and kimchi salad (small portion of pickled cabbage). Yum! All of it was just soo yum and I was just soo happy to be there!   Really reasonable prices with starters/sides around 4-6. I wish I lived in this city as I'd be there all the time!   I highly recommend this place !!",

    "text": "The ramen here is pretty legit.  If you've been going to Wagamama desperate for a fix, only to be disappointed that one of the most important aspects of good ramen, that rich and deeply flavored stock, was replaced by a watery broth...  Come here instead!  My first visit was with my husband, who's probably an even bigger ramen fiend than I am. We've had some fantastic bowls in New York, Vegas (off the Strip there are amazing ramen places), Tokyo and we went in...managing our expectations because we weren't expecting a really good bowl to have made its way to Edinburgh just yet.  We both really enjoyed our meal and I love coming back.   The traditional tonkotsu ramen is done well here. The broth is very good quality. Richly and deeply flavoured, hearty. The chashu pork, egg and other additions well-made too. Noodles are slightly chewy and al dente as they often are in the best ramen.  The Master Chef Burnt Soyu has some strong flavours but I really enjoyed them. If you're a garlic lover this is ideal.   Another thing I loved finding on the menu were the octopus balls (takoyaki). They're a pretty common nibble in Tokyo but I haven't seen them as much in Japanese restaurants abroad and here they're really tasty, served in the standard style with a drizzle of eel sauce, mayo and a little shaved bonito flake fluttering on top.   Other side nibbles include kimchee and gyoza, which are decent.  The restaurant itself is small and informal, service is friendly and relaxed.   Seems pretty popular with students since it's close to the uni, but even if you're not a student it makes for a delicious and fun slurpfest of a meal!",
