    "text": "The Dean Gallery is generally pretty cool, especially at the moment when they have got a surrealist exhibition featuring some Dali, Picasso and Miro originals. But it is the cafe that takes the biscuit. Te-stefully decorated and spacious, it seats about 40 people and in the middle is a huge mechanical statue by Paolozzi which is an impressive sight whist supping away at your drinks.  The menu, if a tad overpriced, is pretty good. There are not a huge selection of teas or coffees but all the classics are there and it's good to Chai a few and share them around as they're all really nice. I had the hot chocolate with cream (inexplicably clotted cream, not whipped cream) which was excellent. The cakes are definitely the best though, once you start one scone in seconds (...sorry). They actually do sell scones, which are excellent, coming with champagne and strawberry jam and cream. There is also a multilevelled cake stand (12 per person or 16 with prosecco) which is so good it'll leave you in tiers.  The staff are really friendly and make the whole experience great. A really good way to finish a tour of the gallery, which is one of Edinburgh's best kept secrets",

    "text": "This is another favourite cafe. Very good points are that you can drive here and park in the gallery car park. If you have a disabled visitor they can enter from the rear with a lift and do not need to walk round to the stairs at the main entrance.   The cafe itself is waitress service and often quite busy. But with gorgeous large windows and black chairs and tables has a very distinctive atmosphere. Calm and serene even when busy.   The teas and coffees are good , but the cakes are always excellent. There is often a fairly limited range of baking on offer, but I have never had anything of bad quality here at all. The brownies are outstanding and so is the lemon polenta cake. Good little shop next to the cafe with presents that would suit an arty friend or relative. And have a look at the allotments on your way out - charmingly maintaining what used to be a kitchen garden from when the building was an orphanage.",

The Mackintosh seats give this cafe its unique feel too. The selection of food is more limited than the other Gallery cafes but as you would expect, just as delicious!",
