    "text": "Here I found out that I actually like haggis, despite the fact that everyone else from home advised me not to try it!  This is a very simple and yet cozy place. I enjoyed staying there and eating my breakfast (for me it was a breakfast).  The food is simple but tasty, and a bit homey, I liked it.  May be because I did not expect a lot, and because I was very hungry, I liked it that much. I will come back definitely next time i'm in Scotland.  The service is very good and the stuff polite. Keep moving on guys and making this place better, you deserve it. Thank you, great job ;)",

    "text": "OK, now you have to realise what a huge step it is for me to do what I'm about to do... (deep breath)... I'm going to award Brunch my accolade of 'best veggie breakfast in Edinburgh'. There, I said it.  It was a Sunday and we were a group of 6. The place was heaving, mainly overspill from the now-too-popular Elephant House over the road (\"birthplace of Harry Potter\", doncha know?). We had to split over two tables, but that was fine.   The staff were working flat out to try and serve everyone, but they managed to maintain a cheery disposition and were really friendly amidst the chaos. I can't imagine what was happening in the kitchen if the front of house was this manic!   But, back to the breakfast. Two veggie sausages (count 'em). Two slices of veggie haggis. TWO eggs, poached (could be any way). Beans (slice of tomato declined). One slice of potato scone. Half an avocado, peeled. Spinach. Asparagus shoots. One slice of wholemeal toast (no butter, but I didn't complain). Oh, and one large Portobello mushroom. I mean, this is not a mere veggie breakfast; this is truly a breakfast of kings! Not the cheapest at 11.95, but my goodness it was worth every penny of that.  The coffee was pretty darn good too. So much so that I had a second Americano (which I don't normally do as it makes my eyeballs do the shimmy).  I was unable to check in at the time as the Yelp app refused to admit that I was in Edinburgh. Even on the free Wi-Fi.  Brunch, you are now my favourite place for err... brunch. Officially.",

    "text": "Had the most phenomenal meal here to start our exploratory day in the city! Seriously this was probably my favorite meal I had in terms of price, variety, taste and health. I was blown away with the portion size. Being from the South in America, I found this to be a welcoming sight after experiencing somewhat smaller portion sizes elsewhere in Europe. The coffee here was also delicious. I think it might have been the best cup I had on the trip as well. They served it fresh and HOT! I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a phenomenal way to start your day out right! Not to mention it's directly across the street from the Elephant House and Greyfriar's Kirk. If I return to Edinburgh I know where I'm eating my first meal!",

    "text": "Stopped here for lunch with My wife and two kids, aged 5 and 3. Staff were friendly, which was sadly the only positive aspect of our visit.  Our waiter had to ask for our drinks order 3 times (only two soft drinks) because seemingly it got lost. Had to wait around 15 minutes for the drinks to arrive.  Ordered a chicken and bacon sandwich for myself, and a 'build your own' burger for my wife. For the kids, we opted for pancakes with berries/bacon. We had to wait around another 25 to 30 minutes for the food to arrive, which is a painful wait with two young hungry children.   The pancakes were unpleasantly dense, and cold in the middle. Turns out the kids pancakes are gluten-free, but this is not clear on the menu. The kids did not eat them, so we wasted 4.95 each.   Our sandwich and burger were not much better. My chicken and bacon sandwich was dry, a tiny scraping of mayo on the top slice of toasted white, no butter in sight. The slaw on the side was ok. The burger was average, nothing special, and the brioche bun was soggy.  When we complained about that lack of clear labelling of gluten-free pancakes, we were told \"There's nothing we can do.\", which sounded an awful lot like \"we don't care\".  37 for a seriously below average lunch for 2 adults and 2 kids is way too much. Service needs to seriously speed up, and the quality of food needs to improve significantly.",

Since we were running out of time, we changed plans and headed inside. The two waitresses are very friendly and helpful, and we were sat and had drinks really quickly. The food came out hot and fresh and in a timely manner. Everything was super delicious!!",

We both had bacon and it was the most tasteless thing I've ever eaten. All of the food appeared to be bought in - for the price I feel that homemade bread should be on offer. The coffee wasn't too bad but nothing to write home about.   Overall, wouldn't recommend as it was poor quality and expensive.",
