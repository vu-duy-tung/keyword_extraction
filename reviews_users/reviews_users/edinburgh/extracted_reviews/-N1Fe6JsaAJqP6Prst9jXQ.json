    "text": "Nice Asian fusion restaurant, inspired by Vietnamese cuisine but suited for the British palate.  Summer rolls with avocados, crayfish, or tuna, rolled in sunflower and pumpkin seeds. Not sure about the tuna. Seeds add a nice touch, especially if you have a peanut allergy.   Banh Mi sandwiches with Hanoi chicken or pork, pickled carrots and dikon, edamame pate, garlic mayo.  Friendly staff, well priced for workday bite or before hopping on the train. Will be bringing friends!",

The owner was very friendly and the ceiling was decorated with colorful paper cranes. It's in an arch under a street so the location was interesting as well.   This place is celebrating its 1st anniversary soon and the owner mentioned he would be celebrating it with himself and a panini... hope the best for the future of this shop!",

Nicely presented soup bowls too. Small outdoor and indoor dining area aswell. Great price and definitely worth it if you like Vietnamese style fusion food",
