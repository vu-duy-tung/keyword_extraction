I have a small beast at home, and I need to make sure she is alive so I rarely make my way to... call, I guess. But when I do, it's for the lovin' AND the coffee.   I don't ever care about food at coffee shops because well, I don't go to coffee shops for food. Sometimes it's necessary to eat because I want coffee at an eating time but the purpose is clear. COFFEE and when I want coffee... I want here.",

I take off a star b/c when I returned a week later for the same experience, the food was like the step sister of the former.  Same food not as fresh tasting or warm or crunchy.  It's like it had sat under a warmer too long.  Or just a different person behind the stove.  Oh well.",

Call me crazy, but is it not a bit of an error for a cafe to be closed on a Sunday?  Anyway, instead I suggested Project Coffee. After we agreed, I then read the Yelp reviews, they weren't good but i'm happy to make my own mind up.  When I got there, Susan had just ordered so I hurried over, asked for a cappuccino and then surveyed the cakes on offer. I'm not great at making quick decisions, so as I debated what to choose, the male member of staff just seemed a bit exasperated at me, not even suggesting \"oh why don't you try our tasty chocolate cake\", nope he just looked bored. I chose the carrot cake and we were told to sit down and they'd bring everything over.  The speed of the service was fine, the coffee was faultless and the cake was delicious. So the only fault, as others seem to also say, was the staff. I would go back, but I think I will go and try other places on my list first :)",

With pleasant enough surroundings, a table to do work on, with small library with local periodicals supporting local events, great barrista and prices not bad either this is so much more tailored towards the coffee meet with friends and chat style coffee house than say its big chain rivals.   Beware of the squeaky chair, no wifi so youd have to use your 3g and the fact they close well before 7pm is not the best but sometimes I dont get into town until then at weekends and end up having to frequent larger busier chains, when all you need is a bit peace to get on with what it is your doing!  Thumbs up though to Project Coffee in providing yet another place to plant your behind and enjoy the delights of coffee sampling in town.",

    "text": "High quality coffee, not quite as good as Artisan Roast (who set the bar not just for Edinburgh but worldwide as far as I'm concerned), but still reliably high end stuff. Like Artisan Roast, they know that the milk isn't meant to be a million degrees hot, and they know that a proper latte isn't a litre of milk like those ridiculous metre-tall coffees you get at some places.   Ok, it's styled in a very Bruntsfield urban outfitters yummy mummy fashion, and if you go on a Friday morning then it's mother group time, but for reliably good coffee on the go or to sit in, I think it hits a pretty good note: neither pretentious nor scruffy.  Foodwise, I've only ever had a scone and it was very good (and they have a deal on for takeaway coffee and a scone for 2.95) but the other pastries and cakes look amazing. They also have a decent looking breakfast and lunch menu. And I've always found the staff friendly, so I can't agree with that aspect of the other reviews. I pop in a couple of times a week on the way to work and now I'm the duke. Woo!",

    "text": "I usually order my coffee to go from here.  Coffee and a scone - yummy coffee and yummy scone.  It's a generally win combination.  I'm not entirely sure what takes so long to prepare the scone and think they should probably just have little take away containers of butter and jam instead of buttering and jaming the takeaway scones themselves but... well it's probably cheaper this way.  I stayed in for coffee for the first time last week. In our (cramped - this place wasn't made for groups lager than 2 or 3) group of 5, we had cappuccinos, americanos, and a flat white.  Everyone enjoyed their drink and mine (the flat white) had a lovely design in the milk.   We also ordered two brownies to share.  The brownies were ridiculous.  They were rich and smooth and gooey and generally the kind of thing you would like to eat every day for the rest of your life.  So, Project Coffee's product is good.  Unfortunately as the other reviewers have said, it's the service which really lets it down.  We were brought our coffees, which was good, but when we received our brownies they'd gotten the order wrong.  When my coworker said she'd actually asked for two brownies (instead of a brownie and something else which I didn't see) she was told \"Oh, well the brownies cost more.  I'll bring your other brownit but it's an extra 30p\" Uh ok well that's fine, except that my coworker ordered two brownies, so is it maybe a possibility that she paid for two and just didn't receive what she paid for?   Even if you can make the 30p argument, could we not have been told in a nicer way?  We had also asked for a knife to cut the brownies so we could all share.  The knife was brought belatedly and just about dropped on the table.  It was just a bit of a bizarre experience with, as I said, good product but the most bizarre and unfriendly service.  I do wish the owners would read the reviews and realise what is letting them down.  There are so many cafes in Bruntsfield, people will soon discover other nice coffee and will move on to friendlier locales.",

Project Coffee, however, seemed to not quite know what it was when I went in.  Perhaps it was because it had just opened, perhaps it was because they were wanting to be \"edgy\"....but it just came across as acceptable coffee from disinterested people.  That being said, the soup was delicious; although I have a recollection that there was some issue with the bread being more or.... similar kind of experience, really, to Emily V and the Brownie of Doom.

One day I ordered eggs benedict and was really disappointed. The hollandaise sauce was just appalling.

The chai latte was good, but not quite warm enough. The tea is good, and is loose tea, which is always a plus... but it's nothing super special.   The main thing here is that the service is slow and lacking in friendliness and hospitality. I think I've yet to see a smile on the face of anyone that works here in the multiple times I've visited. They always seem like they're ready to get my order taken and out of the way so they can get back to whatever else it was they were doing... which is probably figuring out a time consuming route to your table. The staff really don't seem to enjoy their jobs, but they show up and that's admirable.   The redeeming quality for me is that it's an independent coffee shop in a great location to meet up with friends. And it's good for people watching in Bruntsfield. They brunch looks really good, but so do a number of other places within a 5-10 minute walk.",

Usually not requiring connection 24/7, this is not my norm for a 'downside' in an establishment.  I can contently identify as a Luddite..had I no need to work.  But that was the day I had to work.  In brief, my wonderful coffee was gone too fast and I had to do a comfort coffee over at EH10 with WIFI.",

    "text": "Project Coffee do a pretty good latte at a fair price. Ideal if you are passing by on the way to town. Unfortunately, as Jurgen said, their lunch options are rather overpriced, especially for what you are getting.   Their sandwiches are tasty but do seem quite expensive. Any time I'm here I usually get a large latte and the chicken, brie and cranberry sandwich. There is a lot of flavour but the majority of the time the bread falls to pieces. It is pretty good bread though.  The scones could possibly be the best part about this coffee shop. Nothing beats a fruit scone with clotted cream and jam.  Service can be one of two possibilities with no middle ground. Sometimes service can be excellent as you are met with a very happy barista, and other times it seems a little slow although I have to admit it is usually more of the former than the latter.  The best place to be seated is right at the back of the shop on the second of two blue couches although be warned that I have fallen asleep on one of these before.",

Not much appears to be marked cake wise as gluten free and they do food too but it seems to be bread based.  It can get a bit crowded at times and seating is a bit squished which isn't conducive to having a chat without having to move to let people move around.  So, it is ok. Service can be a bit patchy at times but prices not over the top despite Bruntsfield Place location.",

    "text": "As I've mentioned before, I'm pretty passionate about coffee.  So imagine my excitement when I found a brand new shiny coffee house called 'Project Coffee' just seconds from my flat (it's actually not shiny at all, it's decorated very tastefully and the sign is most definitely a matt finish).  Now being a coffee enthusiast (snob) I tend to have one stipulation about a coffee house. And that is that they can make a flat white. Oh can this place make a flat white. Perfectly extracted espresso, milk steamed perfectly (creamy, not frothy) so it had that delicious sweetness. They even pour it with the fancy rosetta, which left me little choice but to take a picture of it.  There are, however, a few reasons this place doesn't get the full 5* treatment. It's fairly reasonably priced (my flat white was 2.10), but you can get better coffee cheaper. Also, they do only serve one type of coffee. But then , this was only their first day of business. A few teething issues aside, this place has massive potential. A very, very impressive start.",

    "text": "I can't really judge this place as I only had a chai while there, but going off the scones and atmosphere, I would say it is a nice stop in the Bruntsfield area. It was right next to where our family booked a holiday stay and every time we walked by it was full and busy. The initial service was a big slow considering how busy they were, but they were friendly and we got our drinks very quickly. The scones were very delicious and well sized for sharing. The chai was okay, very sweet, but fine if you are looking to. It over dose on coffee.   My sister in law said the coffee was good, and it looked well made so I think it would be a good option if you are looking for something less crafty then Artisan Roast. The only annoying thing is that they have these fluorescent lights, which are very unattractive and makes it feel more like a quick stop cafeteria then a nice warm cafe. The interior is very nice with rough brick walls and a comfy couch in the back, but the lights make it not a very nice place to sit for too long.    All in all, a nice stop for a quick drink on the go.",

Their full breakfasts are great but if you're looking for something a bit more healthier they do great smoothies and granola with fruit and yoghurt. Oh and a full selection of different egg dishes which i haven't got round to tasting!l  Be warned though this coffee shop is very popular and fills up very quickly especially Sunday so if your after breakfast you should go fairly early.",

The interior is quite stylish, keeping with the identity of the neigbourhood, and you have a mix of comfy sofas, tables and a counter by the large windows where you can just sit and do some people watching. The music is pretty good, not too loud, and bless, no wifi, so none of the herds of students you get in other places!  A great place to meet a friend for coffee, cake and gossip.",

I ended up having a Parsnip and Chilli soup which was nice, if a little under-seasoned BUT they do small or regular portions which went down well with me as I wasn't after too much.   The layout is a little confusing, we sat at our table for a good wee while not realising that it wasn't table service!? Also, anyone and everyone knows I love a good bit of cake. And even though the scones sounded delicious I have to admit the cake cabinet looked a little bit sad and empty!? Never a good thing.  The service was ok, I didn't really like them passing our soup to us over the counter cause we were sitting near it. I would rather they had come round and put it on the table, it just seemed a little lazy and they weren't exactly busy. Coffee was quite good, but I don't know if I would choose to come here when artisan roast is so nearby.   Overall, it was alright. I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't massively impressed either.",
