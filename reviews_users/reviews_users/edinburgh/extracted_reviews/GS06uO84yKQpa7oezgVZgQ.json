    "text": "I was expecting big things from Cafe St Honore, having heard only compliments about it and I have to say it didn't quite live up to those expectations. That's not to say I didn't enjoy it. it was all very good, just not the jaw-dropping experience I was hoping for.  As a mitigating circumstance, the entire upstairs of the restaurant was taken up with one party of about 30 which seemed to be distracting them a little. Considering this the atmosphere and the service were very good, although they did bring my brother the wrong starter, something that wasn't even on the menu. Not quite sure how they managed that but it was all sorted out very easily. The other thing is that I probably chose the wrong things off the menu. It's not a big menu - 4 starters, 4 mains - and has a few very seasonal options on it which is always a good thing. I went for a fishcake of some description (I don't remember what the varieties of fish in it were, definitely salmon plus a couple of others) which was probably a mistake. A fishcake's a fishcake to be honest no matter how much you tart it up and is never going to be that exciting. However, it did come with razor clam which I've never tried before and loved which made up for the fishcake which was just a little bland. I had Venison as a main course (again quite a boring choice) which came with a potato rosti and some kind of red cabbage and spinach. The venison was delicious and cooked perfectly but as a whole I felt the dish was lacking something. The rosti wasn't up to much so it was lacking a base a little. Whereas I perhaps chose the wrong things, my girlfriend chose differently and loved everything she had so probably I should have had something else. Anyway, I'm looking forward to having another crack at it and picking more wisely.",

As ever we went at lunchtime & the saving was not massive as they do offer a lunchtime menu at a reasonable cost. The ambiance was lovely, the staff were friendly & welcoming & the tables beautifully set. We has a choice of 2 or3 items for each course. I started with the soup of the day whichwas mushroom. It was delicious. Hubby had the smoked trout salad which looked fantastic too. At this point in time I should point out that all of the ingredients are locally sourced, or as many as possible. The quality is outstanding. My only disappointment was the risotto, I don't think it was made with proper risotto rice & the texture was just not quite right. Also being made with smoked haddock it was a bit too salty. I should on reflection have chosen something different as I always have this dish when I go to Skippers & in my eyes it can't be beaten. That said we had a lovely meal & the bill was as we expected. Well worth seeking out if your in the area. Booknig recommended!",

The atmosphere is quite broody with candles and ambient lighting, so perfect for a romantic night out. The staff are attentive and friendly and the food was good. The menu consists of mostly local fare - a lot of fish, haggis and fresh local vegetables - and is tasty with not too large portions. The creme brulee was divine. Water and bread are provided for all tables and the wine list is extensive with a good few decent choices (I am not a wine drinker so cannot comment on the quality of the wine particularly). Overall a pleasant place to spend an evening.",

We went to celebrate our first wedding anniversary earlier this year and had an absolutely wonderful meal. It's not really French any more (apart from in name) but instead they focus on using beautiful, local ingredients. Many restaurants talk about provenance but rarely deliver - the opposite is the case at CSH. Everything on the menu is described in terms of where it came from - they can almost tell you the field that the beef came from or the name of whoever picked the broccoli. The dining rooms are lovely - quite small, but intimate and very classy. The service was fantastic - very professional and slick. They have a great knowledge of the food and the wine they sell. All in all it's a fabulous place to go for a treat-yourself meal. When we were there during the festival I did a double take when I walked past Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens enjoying a meal together.",

The place itself is tucked away on a little side street just behind George street (lots of lovely pubs). It is small, candlelit and plays the part of fancy little French bistro in every way! Menu can look a little pricey, but they have a cafe classics menu which offers two or three courses for a very reasonable 18/23 respectively. Not as many options, but I really enjoyed my meal!   Starter of smoked beef with sundried tomatoes was light and fresh, with a lovely smokey flavour and served with peppery rocket. For main I had the venison Shepard's pie which was rich, gamey with meat that just melted in your mouth. Mash topping was smooth and salty, with just the right amount of crisp from a good grilling. Dessert was a perfect vanilla creme brulee - any French restaurant worth its salt should be able to nail this dish, and cafe saint honore was no exception!   Wine selection was varied and quite well priced, and staff was quite knowledgable in advising a selection to perfectly match my menu choices.   Highly advise a visit if you are in Edinburgh! Booking recommended :)",

Light refreshing with just amount of seasoning to bring out the wonderful flavour of the trout.    My main was the steamed east coast plaice.  I don't know how they do it.  I have to say wow with a standing ovation.  It is the most perfectly cooked fish I have ever eaten.  It basically just ... melts in your mouth.  Even the large prawns are perfectly cooked.  Smothered in a creamy Sauce and underneath, a bed of vegetable that still retains its crunch.  I was in heaven.    To finish off, I ordered the mint creme brulee.  Not the best in Edinburgh I have to say. But the starter and main has won my heart so I will let this one go.   This has got to be one of the highest rated restaurant on my list.  Unfortunately, I was masturdating (yes it's a word) so I didn't get to see and try other dishes.  However, I will definitely be back again to try the others.  It is just perfect.",

I heard about Cafe St Honore and their dairy free menu one day, so I decided to take a chance. The dairy free menu is really just a menu with all the courses that can be altered TO dairy free, so it was a tiny bit disappointing to me that it wasn't the super helpful, allergy friendly menu, but it was better than nothing!  After some help from a very nice waitress who assured me that the chef will be extra careful with my food (she also said he was magic and can make anything that suits anyone's dietary needs), I settled on the Angus Beef Breaseola with red onion jam, leeks, and vinaigrette. It was absolutely AMAZING! The onion jam was really good and its sweetness was a nice contrast with the leek's bitterness. It was a nice portion, too- it filled me up well!   While Cafe St Honore is not super allergy friendly, the chef can alter your dish to your needs and still have it taste delicious!",

Chef Neil Forbes has established himself as one of the countries too chefs, known from local produce and sustainability. From Slow Food to the Sustainability Restaurant Association he has been a vocal advocate of all that's good about Scottish food right now.  The setting feels like a village bistro is the Loire valley, the service is attentive but relaxed and the wine list is balanced from affordable to the slightly more extravagant.  The Cafe have a Classics menu which changes on a seasonal basis and it's has to be said it really is a delight. At 18 for two courses or 3 courses for 23.50 available all night it's also a bargain.  For my starter I opted for the hot smoked mackerel salad. I am a fan of all things smoked it has to be said but this salad was so light and the fish was delicious. The balance of the flavours with the peppery rocket was well.....nom!! Not the most eloquent word but you get it.     For main I went for a superb dish of plaice, one of my favourite fishes to find it on a menu for this price was a lovely surprise. Served on creamed leeks with a potato rosti and bacon the balance was as you would expect from this chef just right!!   The other main on the menu which I tried and loved so felt I had to share was a venison cottage pie. Tradition with innovation and local produce.....for me that sums up this place.   I am for sure going to come back and try the a la carte but for now I will just reminisce and enjoy the memory of my lovely meal.  In the end Cafe St Honore come Highly JD Recommended!",

Located a little off the beaten path (the address says Thistle Street but it's more on an off shoot alley of Thistle but that may be just how they do it here) Cafe Saint Honore did it up right for me on my last night in Edinburgh.  This charming place is quaint mixed with some Old World Charm that makes it the perfect place for a special dinner or date.  We sat on the main level in the front room and had both excellent service and excellent food.  The bread comes up warm and crunchy served with fresh butter.  The wine list is not huge but large enough where you can find something that is perfect for your evening.  It was warm on the night we were there and the house Sauvingon Blanc, while a little fruity, was quite good.  For my starter I went with the risotto with goats cheese and my friend had the pork rillette.  Both were good and very flavorful.  I had the sea bream served over vegetables as my entree and my friend went with the lamb.  Here again- they were cooked perfectly with plenty of contrasting flavors.  For dessert they served something of a deconstructed strawberry shortcake and clotted cream.  Delicious!  Somehow the berries in Scotland are so much sweeter tasting than the ones I get at home.  A lovely restaurant, a lovely setting.  If you like French food- Cafe Saint Honore should be on your list to try.",

So, as apart of the Yelp Eats offer, I made my reservation here on the first day of the offer to see what it would be like.   I felt as though I had gone back to paris, the mirrored walls with the lighting and decor felt like a True french cafe. As I arrived, I had no problem being brought to my table, and with theyre expectation of my arrival they knew where I would sit right away with my candle lit. The service was great, after I ordered my wine my glass never went empty. However, they didn't seem as though they were hovering.   They were also very organized with the Yelp Eats Menus and had them printed and ready to give to us. I ordered the Pumpkin Soup whilst my boyfriend ordered the Game Terrine. I was happy with my choice since as delicious as his starter was, I didn't realize his game would be cold. Obviously I didn't know the definition for terrine but generally when people say game I say 'yes please!'   The soup was perfect, amazing texture and so buttery and smooth. I don't think I could have improved it in any way.   For the Mains we both enjoyed the Plaice. It was a full fillet and was cooked perfectly. It was served with watercress and potatos. I was very impressed with the way the fish was cooked since the bones were still in, but you could pull the meat apart without munching on any bones (not ideal date food etiquette) but as i said, this wasnt the case!    I finished with a artisan roast coffee (jennys fav!, haha)   Overall the staff were fantastic, very friendly and even offered to order us a cab afterwards to get us home as we got our bill.Great evening, go here! I'll definitely go back soon",

The atmosphere was probably more intimate rather than lively and the service was friendly and top notch and they were more than accommodating when i wanted to choose food from 2 different menus.    The food was of excellent quality. I liked the dense, warmed bread given at the start. Nice touch. My confit of duck was lovely, crispy skin and fell off the bone the way it should. I just wish it had come with the traditional puy lentils instead of mustard mash but that said, I ate every scrap and enjoyed it! My friend had the pork belly and said it was delicious.   The menu is very fishy so if you don't like fish or seafood you might struggle with the food choices as its a smallish menu. However I managed to find something i really wanted from both the al a carte and bistro lunch menu and they were happy for me to pick from both. The wine wasn't too expensive, there was a good range for every price bracket.   Would recommend.",

    "text": "Great find tucked away down a little cobbled lane off Thistle Street. I arrived for lunch on a Thursday with 3 colleagues, having booked ahead the previous day for a table of 7. It's a fairly compact dining room inside so I'd no doubt wreaked havoc with their careful seating planning by turning up as a 4 (in my defence, the others bailed on me with only 5 min notice!), and yet I was received with a gracious smile, only a momentary forehead wrinkle and pause, then gestured towards a table for 4.  The service from then on was a little slow, particularly when there's only max ten tables in the place! But they did eventually bring over some menus and later refill bread and water. My boss is quite thrifty so we'd chosen it for the superby-valued express lunch deal, with 2 courses for 14.50. And what good value it was (if not as 'express' as you might expect from the name). The food was wonderful, and that's even after expectations were raised by knowing it's the restaurant of 2014's Scottish Chef of the Year. I'd also suspected we might get hamster-sized portions to nibble on but they were almost too generous. My colleagues were all slightly jealous of my tomato and crowdie (apparently it's a cheese!) starter which was bright and fresh. Then we all chose the venison stew for main, nicely avoiding any food envy. It was so tender you could actually eat it without a knife, though also so rich that I couldn't quite finish the large plate.  The interior of the place is almost stuck in a time warp, with this very olde worlde Parisian bistro feel to it. The incongruity of being in such a romantic little place with my boss and two other guys from my team was actually quite entertaining, in fact looking around most people on a weekday lunchtime seemed to be there on a work day to take advantage of the (not so-)express lunch. I liked the fact that they don't pack the tables in despite it being a small place, so it stays quite intimate and classy and I suppose helps them maintain the quality of the food - it really felt like they took time and care over each plate. Highly recommend for the value for money - I left suitably stuffed and found myself wishing my office had somewhere for an afternoon nap when I got back to work.",

    "text": "I ate in here almost a year ago, and had always planned to write a review. At the time, I was not on yelp, so I think I reviewed it elsewhere, but I felt now that I'm yelping all the time, I should pay tribute to this outstanding eatery.  Set in Thistle Lane, this restaurant offers not only outstanding cuisine and service, but a truly memorable dining experience.  I was there with a party of 8 - and the first thing that impressed me was the service; efficient, friendly, quick - some of the staff are like magicians, performing slight of hand, refilling your glass without you even noticing.  The cuisine served here is what you'd expect from a French restaurant, but what it manages to do so very well, is have an authenticity that you'd be hard pushed to find outside France itself. Having lived in the aforementioned country for a year, I'd consider myself well-versed in genuine Frenchness, and this delightful eatery gets it bang on.  Put simply, they know what they are doing here - everything is cooked with flair, charm and skill. The service is among the best I've ever received. If you're in Edinburgh, and want a meal out that feels like a special occasion, this is definitely nombre une!  An amazing sensory experience!",

    "text": "This is really a delightful restaurant. It has all the style and ambience of a real traditional Parisian restaurant.  The food is freshly prepared daily from local suppliers and really is top notch!  I am not a fan of meat cooked really rare but my two companions both ordered the steak and were extremely impressed. The tartlet I ordered to start and chicken for main was delicious and very moist! My cousin (all the way over from Sydney was really impressed, as he felt it really special place to get taken too for a celebratory meal).  I must admit, the only down point on our last visit (I've been a few times) was that a large group of people were seated next to us, so we felt the service kind of lacked and spoiled the atmosphere a little bit. Saying that, we did have an enjoyable evening, I just feel it's a little too small for large groups. It's certainly more for an intimate evening - and definitely will be very busy come Valentine's day!  I would definitely recommend this hidden gem - and watch out for the lovely harley davidson parked up outside - that made my night!",

    "text": "Last time I was here must have been 15 years ago and the interior hasn't changed a bit. An Edinburgh institution, the mirrored walls and old-fashioned turn of the century decor is like stepping into a time machine. The menu has changed though, updated with a lighter hand and more local produce in evidence.    I was with a small group for a Christmas dinner, and we were all very satisfied with our meal. I started with Stornoway black pudding salad, perfectly cooked. most and flavourful. A classic beef bourguignon  to follow with the meat almost melting in your mouth. Christmas pudding and cardamom ice cream rounded off the meal nicely, although I was casting envious glances at the cheese selection - definiately looked like a winner.  Despite it being a Saturday night and full, service was excellent, from the moment we stepped in.  Still one of the best city centre restaurants if you fell like a treat.",

    "text": "I will admit, I was a little apprehensive about dining at Saint Honore.  First, the location.  When I looked up the map on my iPhone, I was kind of shocked to see it located in an alley.  Of course, I thought perhaps it had the location wrong.  However, the approach was right, and I was even more skeptical walking down a dark, wet alley past the backsides of other restaurants and garbage bins toward the end of the street.  Finally, we saw a lit storefront, and there was the cafe!  The menu changes daily, and the offerings may turn some off as they seem to be quite specialized for the day. However, we were very happy to have stayed.  I had the lamb, which was roasted perfectly.  It was served with a piece of rolled lamb's belly (in the style of a rolled pork belly) and fried.  My friend had veal, which was very nice in a mustard sauce.  Both dishes were well prepared, and very tasty.  For dessert, I had a chocolate tart which seemed to be of a classic French style, and my friend had a Rhubarb tart which looked more like a Bakewell style tart.  Again, both very nice, and very delicious.  Overall, an excellent meal, even with a curious location.",

    "text": "The defining factor of this restaurant is the decor. It feels like you've stepped back in time to old fashioned, romantic Parisien bistro, and really transports you to another world. I had the pleasure of dining here for a very important anniversary of my aunt and uncles about a year ago, and it was really a great experience.  I don't particularly eat French food as a rule, and would probably never choose to eat somewhere like this on a whim, but this restaurant will definitely go down as one of my absolute favourites. For a start, it's a hidden treasure. It sits down a little inshot off of Thistle Street, and to be honest, it looks like a bit of a dodgy place to put a restaurant. However, as soon as you go inside the place it takes your breath away.  The menu is expensive. Way too expensive for a casual dining experience, but, as this was a special occasion, the meal had to follow suite. Put it this way, I'm glad I wasn't picking up the tab!  The menu actually changes a lot, sometimes daily, depending on the produce that can be obtained and the seasons. I like the idea of this, as it always ensures that the food you get is fresh and cooked there and then, which can mean the service is a little slower than elsewhere. I can tell you now, it is definitely worth the extra 15 minutes wait, as the food is simple and flavourful, and feels like a really special dish.  The standout for me was the North Sea Fish pie, which was packed with mussels, white and smoked fish, and creamy potato. It was perfectly seasoned, I didn't even have to add my own salt or pepper (which for me is a big deal, I am a seasoning addict!) and the portion was small, but perfectly formed. A glass of Pinot Grigio (which I later found out was a whopping 9 for a 250ml glass) was the perfect accompaniment. Everyone at my table thoroughly enjoyed what they had, and my Dad still talks about his steak to this day! The sign of a stellar establishment.  Make the wee bit extra effort to hunt this hidden gem out. You may need to take a few extra pounds, but for a special occasion, I wouldn't recommend anywhere else.",
