    "text": "Originally, we had planned to head to a cheese place, I can;t remember the name, but it was shut, it was raining, we were hungry, and this place looked good.   We were seated immediately, by friendly french staff, not a scottish accent in earshot within the servers, which threw us right off!   The decor was lovely, wood, cotton, linen, adorable vintage posters, and bottles and bottles of wine on show, we ordered a red, Malbec if I remember rightly, and it was lovely. I'm no wine critic, and I've stolen someone I used to know's philosophy on wine matching;  \"Do you like the wine?\" Definitely, yes...  \"Do, you like the food?\"  Here? Even more than the wine!  \"Then it matches!\"  And the food! We were brought choices of fresh bread, which smelt amazing and were hard to pick from! Yum And we ordered up.  My picks were;  Savoury cheese mille fueille (autocorrect harassed me on that one!)  Black pudding parmentier Tarte Au Chocolat, with creme anglaise and salted caramel sauce.   My starter was gorgeous, the pastry itself was even rich and cheesy, it was a little bit of a wobbly stack, packed with caramelised onion chutney, it was lovely, and hard to eat politely, without scattering shards of flaky pastry across the oh so french striped tablecloth.   My main, I am actually going to attempt to cook for my partner next week when he visits, it was so good. Very hot, so don't dive in too eager, but it was seasoned perfectly. I find that often, already very herby/peppery things such as haggis and black pudding have too much thrown in with them. And although black pudding is quite a dry thing in itself, this was wonderfully moist.   I'm not always a chocolate pudding person, but I was drawn in by the creme anglaise and salted caramel, it was so lovely, rich and dar without being bitter, the anglaise was perfect, and  not over sweet with the salted caramel on top.   Everything about this place was lovely, and I'm not surprised they have michelin stars displayed on the door. I will be back!",

The waiter was kind, if a bit aloof (maybe they were trying to be truly French?). The snails are delicious, as is the boeuf bourguignon. Lovely wine. A cosy atmosphere. Would definitely recommend !",

    "text": "From the witty and eccentric French waitress, to the complimentary crusty bread, to the steaks, to the cheese, to the absolutely delicious Vouvray the uber trendy sommelier recommended. We. Just. Loved. It!  So French you may start wondering if you accidentally hopped aboard The Eurostar. Tables slightly to close together, though they manage to make this feel cosy instead of clumsy. Simple tablesettings with luxurious starched linen napkins - massively underestimated! Who doesn't love a proper napkin?  Crusty bread arrives not long after you do and is swiftly followed by a tasty and unpretentious amuse bouche, which will keep you entertained while sipping an aperitif.  The menu is incredibly well thought out and a perfect balance of different meats along with interesting fish and veggie options. Sustainability also plays a part with the menu detailing the origin of key menu items and a brief bit of info on the importance of seasonality. Their talented kitchen team work with whole animals and are trained to break down carcasses and learn to make use of every part. This is great for small holdings for whom it is much better to sell a whole animal than just the desirable cuts.  The food is just brilliant. Generous portions of rich, classic cooking, all tasting spectacular. I don't know what else to say on it without sounding like a broken record. De-frickin-liscious!  The closest thing Edinburgh has to France.",

Dinner with colleagues tonight and the restaurant served a superb meal. The steamed mussels were tender and delicious with a fresh taste of the sea with cream and garlic. I ordered a steak entrecote served medium rare. It was a generous steak rather than a paper thin one. The meat was well cooked with a little get crop char. The jus complemented the steak. Even the purple potatoes and the seasonal vegetable were delicious.   For dessert I tried the year old plums soaked in Bas vArmagnac syrup. Different but good finish to a wonderful meal. Highly recommend this restaurant. The sister restaurant, L'Escargot Blanc serves more traditional dishes like Cassoulet. Will try it next time.",

This is a very nice place and I had a great dinner with some Scottish-French fusion dishes. Rillette de Lapin, (rabit) was nice but a little dry and I actually would prefered French style bread with it in stead of the (I guess Scottish?) biscuits.  The entrecote of Scottish beef was beautiful and tasty. I saw on one of the neigbouring tables a great Cote du boeuf    The french (and maybe also some Scottish) cheese plate was good. The (expensive) Chateauneuf du Pape wine was excellent!  The waiting staff was very attentive and fun as well.",

A real taste of France in our little city.  On my most recent visit Steph and I had a superb 3 course meal with some of the houses very own table wine.  For starters I had the filo Camembert with beetroot salad. These are flavors which I can confirm go well together, really delicious, the quality of the cheese really made the dish with the flavor coming through strongly.  For mains I went for the rack of lamb, lamb is something I think I do very well at home so for me to be happy this was going to have to be very very good! It was a risk but sa it turned out one well worth taking. Pink lamb, rich sauce with nice sides.......happy JD!!!  I didn't need a desert.......bum lets be honest I had one :) crepes in a chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream... simple ...tasty... opulent.....delicious!!!!  Very Happy Jd!!!",

    "text": "L'escargot Bleu was voted the best newcomer of the year in 2009 due to the quality of its service and the range of the ingredients used in the food.  It's contemporary French cuisine made from locally sourced Scottish ingredients.  They also sell horse meat.  Now, plenty of people think it's some kind of heinous crime to eat horse meat because they 'like horses'.   So what if they like horses?  Does that mean they'd happily eat a chicken, pig or cow because they don't like them?  Of course not, they just don't fancy the idea of eating a half-domesticated animal.  Man up! Everything on the menu is pretty expensive (especially the horsemeat), but I had the coq au vin which was chicken in a rich red wine sauce.  It was delicious, but cost about 13.  I would certainly come here again as it offers an interesting menu and great service, although the prices do match this quality.",

    "text": "After a hard days work and a little tipple it's always best to grab a bite to eat, on payday you get to upgrade the kebab to something a little more extravagant. On this occasion I was heading down Broughton Street so decided to give L'escargot Blue a shot. I had heard some very good things and thought why should I not give them the chance to impress me??  A roller coaster of an evening was what I discovered ahead of me.  As it's not the biggest I was very fortunate to get a table without a booking. The initial service was very good, they seemed to be a bit rushed off their feet but still attended to us in a quick and polite manner. a good start. A double serving of their pistachio pate amuse-bouche didn't upset me too much either ;-)  It then went down hill.  As a starter I ordered the steak tartare and after the show that was the preparation of the dish - they bring out all the ingredients and make it all in front of you - unfortunately I think it would probably be better if the chef had a bit more input into the food then customer. It certainly wasn't the best I'd tried.  The next part of the meal however was an extreme high. The main I ordered was a Chicken and Ham pie served with a few bits of carrot. Nothing special there you say, and you would be right. A very tasty and enjoyable pie it was, a rich creamy sauce smothering large chunks of perfectly cooked Chicken and succulent Ham. The thing which drew me to this particular meal was the inclusion of Rose Veal Sweetbreads. This was my first experience of the ingredient that seems to be a firm favourite of chef's everywhere. If they all tasted as great as they did on this night then I want them to be included in more dishes.   An absolute highlight to any meal I've had.  Next came the vertical drop.   I had been preparing myself for a hefty dent to appear in my bank balance but the innocent looking piece of paper placed in front of me held a secret that would make (insert name of current banker/politician in the news over being greedy here) blush.   For the overall service and quality I would say this place would be good value if it shaved 15% off it's bill. We were there slightly after the 7.50 menu finished and I think their policy is to make everyone else pay for the rest of the earlier bills!  I would never tell anyone not to go here in fact the opposite go and try it, but save up first.",

This is not the only establishment in the world, or Scotland for that fact that serves it. I don't want to eat it, but nobody is forcing me too. There obviously must be a market for it because it's on the menu, so each to there own. So I'll stick to the restaurant as a whole.  My dish came out very quick and the staff were nice.

All the staff are French so you can hear them all speaking French to one another so its easy t forget you are in Scotland!  The food here certainly isn't on the cheap end of the scale but the ingredients are of the highest quality and you can tell by the taste. My soup was delicious, and this was followed by cassoulet which once again took me right back to my summer holidays when we ate cassoulet at least 5 times a week!!  Great experience and a good escape to a French bistro in the heart of the French countryside (you'll have to squint a little for the French countryside bit!!)",

    "text": "L'escargot Blue, the sister restaurant to Queensferry Street's L'escargot Blanc, is the most recent winner of the List's Newcomer of the year award. You can see why: not only is it beautifully decorated with huge antiquated posters advertising liqueur alongside simple furnishings and typically French chequer tablecloths, but the food is packed full of flavour, and expertly cooked. I went for lunch, and had three courses for 20. You could spend a lot less by only having a main, as they are very reasonably priced at 7.50 each. Beware of the evening, though, as that price rockets up.  They do normally have farmhouse apple juice, but had run out when I visited so I opted for freshly squeezed orange juice. Many restaurants are lazy when it comes to stocking fruit juices, so I was impressed by their attention to detail. Freshly squeezed orange juice is hard to beat when it comes to full-on flavour, and this was a good one. The waiter was friendly, very attentive and sharp.  And the service was very prompt. The was fairly basic but tasted good. I ordered a side dish of provencale aubergines to , and they were lovely: buttery and very soft. For pudding I had a tart tatin, which was incredibly boozy. In case you are wondering, there is nothing wrong with that at all. It was approximately 95 percent apple and 5 percent pastry, so there wasn't a great deal to soak up the powerful kick of the apple. Luckily I'm not the greatest fan of pastry and would much rather have a more apple than pastry. For some reason, it was served with strawberry ice cream, which kinda threw me. Strawberry and apple don't get along too well, that's why. Still, there's no way that pudding could be called bland.  I couldn't fault much about the lunch. The starter could have been a bit more exciting and the pudding could have done with a different ice cream, but considering the value, and the quality of the cooking, these are small gripes. This place really feels like the real deal. There's even an epicerie downstairs selling amazing french produce including cheese, meats, wine, coffee, buscuits and bread. As a lady near me eloquently pointed out, \"it is quite French\".",
