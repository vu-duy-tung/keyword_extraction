    "text": "I hadn't eaten all day. It was 3:30pm. A very unusual situation for me. Every other eatery along my North-Westbound walk was closed. I walked into The Sandwich Shop.  The Sandwich Shop is like most Scottish establishments of the same nature- tiny eating area and carb-heavy food. But one way it differs is selection- although primarily offering 'breakfast rolls' (served all day) and sandwiches, the possible filling combinations are many. Relatively rare items- such as jalapenos- abound.   Another way it differs is value. For just over 5 I got this: a sausage link breakfast roll; a small soup of the day (tomato and chorizo sausage); a salami sandwich with lettuce and jalapenos, in combo form alongside a bag of salt & vinegar Walkers crisps, and a bottle (yes, bottle- not a can) of sugar-free Irn Bru. All that for JUST OVER 5.  My meal filled me up and that is rare.   But here's the kicker, Yelp- the woman who made my sandwich- she literally covered it in jalapenos. This was not a typical, single salad-tong-full of four or five slices spread over the length of the sandwich. She carefully placed the jalapenos in a spicy blanket over the entire surface area. Perfection.   For a tiny, cheap sandwich shop- THE Sandwich Shop lives up to its name.",

    "text": "This tiny little shop on Dalkeith Road was a pleasant find. Studying (or at least trying to) in Pollock, I felt hungry but didn't want to walk far. I found the Sandwich Shop on Yelp and popped out to have a look. The interior is absolutely tiny, with only two little stools to sit on. I imagine most people take away. The menu boards are, however, extensive. As well as serving breakfast rolls all day, you can have a sandwich with a huge variety of fillings. I chose a hot steak baguette.  Prices are great, and you can even get a sandwich, crisps, and drink sub 4. Top quality. The place wasn't busy when I went, so I was served very quickly indeed, and I was back to \"studying\" (YouTube) before I knew it. Recommended.",

    "text": "Okay, before I even start - the coffee cream biscuits are to die for. If you get anything here, get those!   Otherwise, they serve a wide selection of sandwiches, hot or cold, along with drinks, crisps and homemade desserts. They don't really have the room to eat in, so it's get in, grab what you want and get through the crowds to get out again.   The staff who work here are really friendly and helpful, even to clueless Americans such as myself who kind of point at things and go, That one please. They always have a smile to spare, and that really makes a difference.",
