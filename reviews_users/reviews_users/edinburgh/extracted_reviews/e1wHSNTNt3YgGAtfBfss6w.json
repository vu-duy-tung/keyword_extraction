The resemblance with one of the waiting staff there is so uncanny, you should really check this one out for yourself !!   That's not the only reason you should visit this cafe however. Cafe Truva is so good that I've visited twice. In the space of two days.   I think it's the incredibly friendly staff which makes this cafe stand out from its neighbours on the Royal Mile. That, and the Turkish authenticity of the food, the decor and the coffee.It's a great spot for lunch or a cuppa (on visit #1 I had a strong brew accompanied by a yummy muffin) with a varied, reasonably priced menu (on visit #2 I had a roast veg & hummous wrap- DELISH!). Full marks.",

I couldn't quite work out if the place was a restaurant or a cafe, looking around I was noticing some people sitting down to a dinner with a glass of wine and others were simply drinking coffee and chatting. This I found a little strange but maybe this is the feel the owners are going for.  I had the soup and lamb moussaka lasagne and my fiancee had the Kofte Gratin, all were very well cooked, not too salty and were delivered well on the plate, you even got a little dolma on your plate which I have been missing since my last time in Turkey almost 2 years ago. After dinner we had a look at their cakes which take up a large portion of their front counter. Everything from Carrot cake to tiramisu and all of them looked beautiful.  The decor of the place was very 1990's Scottish cafe. Woodwork that was in need of a little varnish, carpets that had a design that Pink Floyd couldn't create at their most \"creative\" and couches that had almost the same design as the carpet that hadn't been touched up in quite a long time.  Overall we had a very nice and enjoyable night and would recommend people to try here if you are at this end of the Royal Mile and fancy something different for dinner.",

So today I finally decided to see what  this buzz was all about, and needless to say my expectations were exceeded from the moment I entered the store...   The store holds a beautiful ambiance with lots of traits from Turkey, the staff are really friendly and the owner is a delight to speak with!   For 8 I ordered the cafe's special dish 'Shish Kebab' and for that value I was delighted with the taste and size of portion I received. They have a  ridiculously large selection of chocolates and cakes, and it was a treat to scuffle down a blackcurrant cheese cake. Their Turkish coffee is a MUST to try, and get ready to be treated with a couple of Turkish delights as leaving the store!  If you ever pass by  Royal Mile, do not hesitate to enter  I definitely recommend Cafe Truva!",

Armed with a craving for cake, we marched through the crowds (even on such a rain drenched Sunday) wandering the Royal Mile watching Fringe groups tout their trade to find a coffee shop that would sate my need. Cafe after cafe we wandered until we hit Cafe Truva which had a nice looking array of choice. We plumped for two coffees, a slice of cherry and custard cake as well as a slice of apple and caramel tart. Both were super sweet. The cheery bit through the very custardy custard, while the caramel was the main star of the tart with strong support by the apple (could have been more apple though). The coffee helped clean up all that sugar.   Here, the service is very friendly and it was only when I paid (fifteen quid for the above) did I make the connection with the cafe in Leith. Turns out there is another at Tollcross (I think) which our waiter rated pretty highly. Seeing that I have been to two now, it would only be fair to visit the third, just, well, you know, because. It's a hard life, I tell you, but I'll do it, if only for the sake of Yelp.",

It's located at the bottom of the Royal Mile and like most cafes in the area, is always choc-a-block. Like most cafes on the Royal Mile, I had my reservations when I sat down for a cup of apple tea wondering if it was just an overpriced tourist trap cafe with no substance. When I saw their HUGE selection of tasty cakes all was forgiven and I spent ages deciding what cake to go for.   As it is a Turkish cafe, Cafe Truva has an excellent selection of Turkish foods and teas and as I looked around at other patrons I could see that there wasn't one thing on the menu that I wouldn't have liked.   I devoured my large slice of chocolate cake in mere minutes and sipped my apple tea whilst doing a spot of people watching.  Overall, this is an excellent cafe. It may be busy all the time, but I guess that says something in itself. Once you've had a slice of cake from here, you'll be going back time and time again for more.",

Cafe Truva is a Turkish cafe located at the bottom end of the Royal Mile, the slightly less tourist exploited end. It isn't the cheapest cafe, but its not bad, especially by Royal Mile standards.  I've been several a times and each time the staff have been very welcoming and accommodating. Apart from tea and pastry (which is lovely), breakfast at cafe Truva is also a surprising treat (served all day).  A potential tourist trap, Cafe Truva turns out to be much more, selling decent Turkish meals and snacks, good coffee, and all importantly apple tea.",
