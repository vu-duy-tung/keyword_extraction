The beautiful stained glass lights that hang everywhere capture your fancy, and it really portals you to a different place.   There was a deal, for $10 you get to choose 5 options, so we got two of these deals, and shared 10 options between 4 people. This was the perfect amount of food. The very sweet and calm waiter gave us some recommendations, and with a mix of spicy, non-spicy, vegetarian and meat, we got to taste so many new things.   There was some grape leaf wrapped vegetarian item, and it was such a different flavor, really unlike anything I had before, and I loved it! The spicy food WAS spicy, and there was a chicken item with a creamy kind of sauce, that I gorged on. So, so good.   It's BYOB, so we had two bottles. And they let us stay there for about 3 hours, I think. There was no rush, no worry, just a long meal, and long conversations, filled in by amazing Turkish music.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to visit Empires for ages so when I was going to a Festival event in the area, it seemed like the perfect time.  First oddity came from a miscommunication with my friend in that we both called to book- I was able to while my friend was told they don't take dinner bookings during the Festival. At least we got our booking?  Second oddity was when I looked at the menu online but was presented with a different one when we arrived. What I'm assuming is a Festival menu, breaks the food into four different platters with no substitutions. I'm assuming that the platters must have been pre-made, with the hot options zapped in some way just prior to serving. This menu, while much easier for the kitchen, left us with food we weren't interested in eating and also seemed unnecessary as the restaurant never got completely full while we were there.   I love mezze and Turkish food but found none of the items particularly stand out delicious, though equally nothing was bad.  The restaurant itself is charming and cozy and staff are nice.  I may return after the Festival but only because I don't know of another Turkish mezze option in Edinburgh.",

The place is small but so cosy one wish to never leave and continue the journey along the streets lit by the moon light and sounds of a multicultural mecca.   Ceiling is covered with colourful lamps from the gran basar, oriental carpets and pillows. On week ends musicians plays and the atmosphere is rising to the corners of the neighbour hood on St Mary's Street.  The food is delicious and healthy! Simply!  Great place for parties as well as 1 to 1 dinner.",

I stopped in later on a Tuesday evening for dinner and ordered the Three Meze dish and found that the serving size was perfect for one person where afterwards I was happily full but not stuffed. My lamb musakka could have been a tad hotter (in terms of temperature), but the taste was definitely there. I also ordered a small teapot of their apple tea, which was so delicious! Finally, the baklava - which was a lot larger of a dish than I expected - was sweet and crunchy and the perfect ending to the meal. The prices are reasonable, but remember to bring cash as they do not accept cards!",

    "text": "First off, as others have mentioned: cash only! It's a bit of a walk to the nearest cash machine, so fill your wallet before sitting down to order.  We were caught in a typically grey and rainy evening in the middle of Festival season, searching for somewhere that was both open and not fully booked. From the outside, Empires looks every bit as hipster as it truly is. Slightly run down and tacky, but emanating a warmth and friendliness.  We were seated upstairs in the somewhat claustrophobic loft with low ceilings and not much air to breath, but it was comfy and casual. The service was quick, attentive, and friendly - one of those restaurants with a student kitchen kind of vibe to it.  The food is good if not great. We went for the vegan platter and the hot platter, which was more than enough food for two people. This need to order one platter each means that the price climbs pretty quickly, and I'd say it's somewhat more expensive than it's worth. The variety is nice though, with several types of Mediterranean meats, cheese, salads, dips, and so on. I do wish the pita bread was more fresh though!  If you're looking for something that's not a pub, or somewhere where you can just sit back and relax, then you could do worse than Empires. Four stars for the service, 2.5 for the food.",

Both a good 5 min walk away.  So after a detour to get cash (am I the only one that is over reliant on the plastic in my wallet?) we returned to a cozy table in the corner. Except the staff kept opening the front door to get rid of the incense smoke & each time I was hit with an icy artic blast...  It's byob which is cool. Neither I nor the new Mrs G were drinking. She had the mint tea & I tried the pomegranate juice. Both were fine. Water was presented in a lovely silver jug.   Food wise we each opted for a 3 dish meze. I had the chicken, the meatballs & the olives. Mrs G had the halloumi, stuffed peppers & something else I can't quite remember. What we had was nice & tasty. We weren't told that they were out of pitta so it was a bit of a surprise when our plates arrived with some brown bread. Not what I was expecting & no comment/acknowledgement from the waitress either.  Unfortunately the bread had seeds in it which Mrs G can't eat (allergies) so I asked if we could have an alternative. The waitress was polite but adamant they had no pitta & even when I asked if they had anything else. Eventually I spoke to another member of staff & eventually we were offered some rice. Fair enough. Too much palaver though. It should've been much easier to sort out.  That's why it only gets 3 stars.",

Particularly for people like myself who get ridiculous food envy/can't decide what to have for breakfast in the morning, so the mezze 'element' (meh) of the menu is ideal - pick a bit of this, dip a bit of that, done, you feel like you've had a bit of everything.  It was BYOB last time I checked, so remember your bottles if you want to have a bit of the hard stuff with your mezze. Also, it is wee as highlighted at the start, so book ahead if there's a bunch of you. There's a cool, almost loft-like space at the top of the restaurant for chilled dining, and there are often bands playing too.",

I have been here several times and with the mezi being around 3.95, my friends and i get around 4 each and with the small corkage fee and tip this amounts to around 18 each. The only thing i will mark them down on is the fact that the menu hasnt changed over the 3 years or so that i have been going. I always enjoy what they serve but perhaps a bit of innovation is needed with the menu?",

Despite having a newspaper on hand, I still felt obliged to explain my singularity to the guy working here via a half-hearted \"I'm just on my lunch break.\" I got a sympathetic nod in return.  It was worth breaking the social boundaries however, and was the best lunch I've had in a while. There's only a very limited menu of 3 mixed meza plates on at lunch, and I went for the only meat-laden option. Grilled garlic sausages, chicken, i basket of flatbreads and a fantastic yoghurt sauce were all good, but the rubbery, meaty cheese was the star of the show. Utterly fantastic, especially when dipped in the sauce.  Great service too. I'll be back soon, hopefully minus the stigma.",

But open it was on a dark and cold Sunday night and what a warm, welcoming space it is for a Scottish winter. It's a cafe serving Turkish mezze - your standards - hummus, baba ghanoush, falafel, moussaka (Veggie and not so much) as well as more interesting choices such as crushed hazelnuts in a tomato sauce (delicious, thank you for asking). Served with warm plates of pitta studded with caraway seeds, mezze it might be but we came out stuffed. We also did take advantage of the size of our table and ordered the entire menu to try the lot. Overall, I didn't find any particular bum notes - although I was disappointed with the baba ghanoush personally, but everyone had their own opinion on what was best. I loved the char grilled aubergine, the boy thought the air dried Turkish sausage was delicious. The parents tucked into crushed walnuts and meatballs with gusto.   If I went through everything we ate, it literally would be everything. We washed it down with pomegranate juice and mint tea. Water is served to the table in beautiful metal jugs (the decor of this place is just fab). Your meal is accompanied by an eclectic collection of music including local artists who also perform there live from time to time. I absolutely fell in love with this place. The boy (also known as the silent reviewer) argued that the price we paid was a little steep... I would argue for five mezze per person (16 quid), it was more than enough for one person.. three mezze may be just right. But for a throw caution to the wind and try everything meal, it was fab.   Oh and before I forget - it's BYOB with a corkage fee and cash only payments - be warned!",

We were seated in a lovely area, the tiled walls had Turkish mosaics and murals on them which really set the scene for a great meal. There isn't a great deal of space but the atmosphere is great and the staff are all very friendly and happy to explain any dishes that you're unsure of to you, which for me was every one!  I decided on the falafel with humous to start which was lovely, I could eat it all day and not get bored, then moved onto a dish called Beyti, a chicken dish marinated and rolled into a flatbread served with a tomato and pepper sauce and garlic yoghurt. It was delicious, tasted fresh and healthy and I was left really satisfied and curious to try some of the other dishes, everything looked awesome!  We left after having a Turkish apple tea which was sooooo tasty! I will definitely be purchasing some to have at home, it really was delicious.
