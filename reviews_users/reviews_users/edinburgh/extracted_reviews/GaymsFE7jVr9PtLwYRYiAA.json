The waiters were welcoming and the food didn't take too long arrive.  The food, although not particularly bad, was far from being the best Indian food I've tasted.  I ordered the chicken bhuna with pilau rice and I'm pretty sure the chicken was overcooked, but the sauce was excellent with a good mix of vegetables and spices.  The rice also tasted a bit overcooked and soft, as if it had been sitting out for a while.   In its favour, the menu is enormous with plenty of curries, kebabs and vegetarian options, all of which are pretty reasonably priced around the 5 mark.  Although my meal wasn't the best I've heard good reports about it and would probably give it another chance.",

With Khushis having opened up just down the road, they have revamped the interior, which I think definitely encouraged us to go and give it a try. I wasn't sure what to expect but I really was surprised and will most definitely be back.  We had the poppadoms as an appetiser  - which came with a really good selection of different sauces - not just the usual mango chutney.  I had the mixed kebab starter which was really good - especially the spicy mini lamb chops. I wasn't so sure on the shish kebab but my dad loved it! The chicken tikka bites were delicious.  I had a special chicken bhuna with steamed rice - which was a nice change to the usual basmati. The portions were good sizes and for once I didn't feel too full after the main which was ideal.  Their selection of Movenpick ice creams was great - try the mint choc chip one! They also had a selection of Indian desserts also.  The bar list was not extensive but just what you needed and pretty reasonable.  It was quiet, although it was a Monday night but a fair few folk came in around 10ish after the Playhouse opened it's doors. Shame some of the people sitting next to us were very ignorant, 'do you do prawns? My friend doesn't like rice!' oh dear.  I would definitely recommend, just a shame the staff have to put up with some really awful people!",

I had the special chicken Karachi which was so bad that I ended up leaving it. I had also ordered a Lamb Biryani which was an even bigger disappointment. The Biryani was served in a massive bowl which was more than half empty. Not sure why use such a big bowl if they intend to leave it empty. The rice was half cooked and the chef had not bothered cooking it at all. In short, stay away if you want real Indian food. However the servers were very friendly and the decor is kind of  hip.  I won't ever eat here again?!?",

I wasn't too impressed on first impressions of Shezan. It sort of reminded me of a takeaway with it's neon lights and menus sellotaped into the windows, but it just goes to show appearances can be deceiving.  I was impressed with the decor inside, nothing too OTT just nice simple tables and chairs which is a nice change from rugs hanging everywhere and flock wallpaper. I didn't have the same problem as the other reviewers did with the service, infact, I had the opposite problem! We had barely sat down when the waiter asked for our order, which I thought was a bit rude! We ordered our meals, feeling a bit rushed, and they came out in double quick time.  My chicken tikka bhoona was very nice, a massive portion, and just the right amount of spice. The rice was nice too, if a little cold, but I didn't mind that too much. The price of the meals weren't too bad at all, with my curry and rice totalling about 12, the rice being nearly 3 alone, a bit steep.  It was OK. Not great, not awful, just OK.",

They asked if we had reservations (which we did not) and he asked us to wait for a minute. He came back and said we can stay but they need the table in an hour, which was perfectly fine to us since we just wanted to eat and go home.  Food 5/5:  One of the best Indian cuisine I have had. And that's saying a lot since I've eaten Indian cuisine all over the world. I had the lamb biryani which was fantastic. Medium spice was the perfect heat. My mother got the chicken curry and the chicken was perfectly cooked - very tender.  We had regular and garlic naan, which we two massive pieces of naan. Great tasting and textured naan. One piece is good for 2 people, so we were very happy.  Note - if the dish doesn't say it comes with rice, I recommend ordering a side of rice. The side is a small bowl of rice.  Service 5/5:  The staff is very friendly and come to ask you if everything is okay. The food comes out quickly and fresh too.  Overall 5/5:  One of the best Indian cuisines I've had. Glad I stopped in and they took us!",

To our surprise, garlic naan was a monster size bread full of flavor! Chicken was nicely made and tastefully presented. Chicken biryani was served with a sauce which was tangy and it jived well with biryani (no raita was served though).  One of the servers was a bit eager to ask if we were ready to order, if we were ready to pay, if we surely did not want to order tea? A bit weird, but i am sure it was all in innocence. Ignoring that bit.  I would like to come back!!",

We even got lots of little munchies with small dipping sauces to start.   Surprisingly the service was kind of weird and a little overbearing.

I tried the chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, and aloo gobi, and all were very good quality, not too greasy, and flavorful with just the right amount of heat...hot but not too much (I'm sure they could dial it back on request though).    My only complaint is I found it a little pricey for what you get, I especially wanted a larger portion size for the pilao rice, larger samosas (my family typically shares a two piece order four ways, but these were almost too small, better suited for two), and more chicken in the tikka masala which was mostly gravy.",

    "text": "For those of you who have yet to experience it, let me just say that there is something so comforting about seeing a \"People Love Us on Yelp\" sticker in the window of a popular restaurant in another country when you've been wondering around without access to the app and are almost too tired and hungry to care where you actually eat.  With that said, thank you Edinburgh Yelpers for this treasure.  After a full day of walking and touristing after a full week of pub grub, we were ready for something different.  I'd tried to find an Indian place recommended by the guide book from memory, and failed.  So we headed back towards our guest house, remembering several busy Indian places on Leith Walk.    Shezan drew us in with the bright and modern decor, self-described in the menu as \"Bollywood.\"  We were seated immediately, and eagerly perused the menu trying to figure out which dishes were the cause of all the tantalizing smells from those around us.  We decided on samosas, chicken tikka masala, chicken karahi, a side of saag, rice, and naan.  The samosas (3, with a selection of 3 sauces) were crispy on the outside with fluffy and flavorful fillings.  The mains were amazing, particularly the karahi.  The karahi had so much flavor but without filling heavy.  It was plenty spicy in a way that had just enough heat to wake you up, but not so much to cover the other flavors or make you reach for something to cool off your tongue.  The naan was huge - the size of my head.  Perhaps I'm just accustomed to other restaurants that cut it into peices rather than presenting it in on big piece, but I've never seen naan this large.  It was crispy on the bottom and fluffy on top, delicious.  The food definitely deserves 5 stars.  The service, not so much.  It started off well, but even when we'd cleaned our plates (and yes, there were no morsels, not even of sauce left), and there was nothing left in our glasses, it took several minutes to get the attention of any staff to ask for the check.  It's probably us not being accustomed to the European way of lingering at a table all night, but still felt like we'd been forgotten.  That aside, I'd still highly recommend it.",

So we walked down the street to Shazam and wow - so glad we did.   Super flavorful food - we had the Chicken Rogan Josh, Lamb Byrianai, and Saag Paneer. Great portions, super tasty food and a staff that was on top of anything.   Definitely worth a look if you are in the area. No desire to try any of the other Indian places nearby, I'll always head here due to the staff.   Cheers!",

    "text": "Not gonna lie, it was a massive disapointment. Me and my fiance went because it had really good reviews. We went, we got a table all was fine. We order the food and wait, and wait. An hour and a half later we get our food (both fairly simple dishes). We noticed in this long wait that 3 tables that had come in 45 minuets after us where recieving food, this was more noticeable seeing as we where the second table in at the time. When we eventually got our food, it wasn't anything special, the chicken didn't absorb any of the sauce, we'd of been better ordering an Indian from any of the other 5 Indians on that street. Further more the menus was rather plain, I prefer my dishes to be lamb (which is traditional) an option that they don't offer. All and all I wouldn't go again, but the waiter we had was very kind but did come across as kinder, when he asked for us to review them and add his name on trivago. Not impressed.",

    "text": "Shezan's browser logo is the first letter of their name which in their customized font and hue resembles a coiling mountain of excrement towering like Babel crowned with a thin streak which could be mistaken for the gaseous side-effect of such a discharge.        Now that's out of the way, Shezan is one amazing restaurant.   That's Shezan, not Shazan, which I originally thought, or Shazam, which I so desperately wanted.   We (including girlfriend) had tickets to the evening show of Gravity at the theater up the street (immediately dating this review).  Gravity is awesome, see it or buy it, 'nuf said...going off topic.  We both felt incredibly lucky to find Shezan--well, my girlfriend already knew about it; I just let myself by guided, which is...OK.   Shezan claims to be an Indian restaurant but it may be too trendy to be one.  It's a colossal bistro with intentionally mismatched white and black chairs divided among polished wooden tables spaced generously but seemingly chaotically about the floor.  Huge photos plastered on the walls offer the impression that I should be trying on a pair of designer Armani slacks.  There's actually glitter on the walls, that's how flashy this place is.  It didn't look cheap.  I didn't see a buffet anywhere; in fact, I couldn't see a single hallmark of Indo-Canadian cuisine.  The menu confirmed those suspicions, offering numerous items seldom seen in Western restaurants.  The biggest surprises were the prices.  They weren't expensive.  Even taking conversion into account, I'd say Shezan was downright reasonable.  They even offered a three course pre-theater menu for 17.50, or about $30 Canadian, and with that you get a lot of food.   I know I'm losing your interest.  I should be nitpicking or exasperating a minor quibble into a huge crisis.  I'll soon mention the food, which will convince most people in the area to try out Shezan if they haven't already.  I could carp on their portion sizes being perhaps a tad TOO generous, but what kind of criticism is that?   We opened our meal with a poppadom and pickle tray and followed that with butter chicken and chicken biryani, the latter a virtual unknown dish in Canada.  We also ordered a peshwari nan which is a naan bread made with coconut milk.  I thought I had good naan, but peshwari makes previous naan feel like that slightly depressing opening act before the Blue Man Group takes the stage.  (I'm sorry, that's the only band I've ever seen in person on stage.)   However, the portions were so large we were both unable to completely finish our plates, precluding the opportunity to take in a dessert, which we both badly wanted to try.  Not for any unique Indian dish mind you, but rather for a couple scoops of moevenpick ice cream.  It was winter and I didn't care; I wanted ice cream.  My girlfriend and I made guesses about what the other would order.  I would have tried the white chocolate and caramelita, though the pistachio and maple walnut looked pretty good to.  Unfortunately we didn't order any of them, an issue worthy of mention again.  I appreciate the desire to make us satisfied but it looks like more and more restaurants are perhaps making us TOO satisfied, preventing us from making it three courses instead of two.  I'm just saying I would have paid for ice cream if the meal portions were a tad smaller.   I know, I'm waiting to be tarred and feathered by a mob of overweight Americans who would then promptly try to devour me for looking like oversized chicken in a black polyester longcoat.  And I do acknowledge my reaction upon discovering the 12-inch poppadom, a stretch of starch eclipsed by the naan which followed.  I was overjoyed by such generosity.  The final bill came to a few pence over 30 pounds, making it cheaper for two people than an average under-posh meal in my home town.   A final word, once again I paid with a card and once again there was no tip option.  Since I had no cash on hand, I couldn't drop down a few bills for the exceptional service provided.  I felt like crap afterwards.  They totally deserved gratuity.  At least I could repay them this way, by recommending Shezan whole heartedly.  Just try to ignore what the first letter of their name resembles and you'd do fine.  I should run a list of restaurant which I would frequent IF I lived in Edinburgh.  Shezan would be near the top of a very short list.  DECOR:  8 PLATING: 8 SERVICE:  8 FOOD:  9 VALUE:  10  OVERALL:  8.6 out of 10",

    "text": "Outstanding Indian food in a very Scottish town.  After eating our fill of fish and chips and meat pies for 10 days, we ventured out for something different for dinner.  A local cabbie recommended this place and it was OUTSTANDING.  They had a broad menu, as most Indian restaurants, with a lot of variety including some dishes I haven't seen before.  The Naan was excellent, and our entrees were both beautiful and delicious.   Impeccable service and a very clean and slighly modernistic interior. Highly recommended!",

    "text": "I live almost opposite Shezan Tandoori, and I have to complain about all these restaurants in the area! It's seriously hurting my bank account and making the previously enjoyable task of cooking seem rather tedious.   Shezan, which serves Indiad food, is definitely in Italian restaurant territory, with Ferri's, the Sicilian restaurant and Guiliano's surrounding it... However, it's probably what makes it (as well as Phuket Pavilion right next to it) a little refreshing, so a friend and I decided to get take out one night. We weren't that adventurous, opting for simple naan bread and Chicken Bhunaa, which hasn't disappointed me anywhere I've gotten it! I didn't have much to complain about, and I'm keen to have an actual dining-in experience there. The number of diners seems to have picked up recently, probably because we're in the tourist period, but this makes it look much less dodgy than I previously thought it was!",
