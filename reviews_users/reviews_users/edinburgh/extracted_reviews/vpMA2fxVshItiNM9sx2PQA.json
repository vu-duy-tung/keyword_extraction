    "text": "The Dome is just a wonderful place to go to in Edinburgh. It really is special, and  is something tourists have to see. The dome Garden Cafe always looks wonderful too. It is in a great location, on Rose Street but down a few steps so it's in its own little world. It's always busy too, despite being al fresco.  I totally agree with Fiona, it really is an oasis! Because it is down some steps it is in its own little cul-de-sac, avoiding the wind yet trapping the sun. If it rains they have a lovely cover too. It's a great place!  The food is really good, if a little pricey. They offer lovely lunchtime sandwiches or salads, and have a bigger menu if you fancy. Their chicken salad is my favourite.",

    "text": "Had to visit this place for a drink, after passing it on a tour and the tour guide highly recommended it. It is amazing to see!  Beautifully decorated, very expertly run and very welcoming. Sampled a 14 year old Oban, the Honey had a glass of wine and we shared a cheese plate. An excellent experience!  The server who took our order was very knowledgeable, efficient and courteous., as was the server who brought us the drinks. The entire experience was very satisfying. Must stop here when possible!",

    "text": "The Dome is made up of three different restaurants, and they're all so different I thought the Garden Cafe definitely deserved its own review.  Slotted in on Rose Street, at the back of the huge and imposing columned Dome buiding, this gorgeous little city-centre oasis is the perfect place to rest your shopping-weary feet and have a tasty lunch. It's only open from april to early september, and although it's tucked down a narrow street this place is a great little suntrap.  You can get wraps, salads, soups, burgers, that sort of thing here - not a full a la carte lunch, but the portions are fairly generous so you'll only need one course.  The service was ok, but our waiter didn't even bother to bring us our change back. We had been planning to leave it as a tip for him, but we thought it was a bit cheeky of him just to assume, especially when service is already included in the prices. For a salad and a soft drink you'll spend just over 10 a head, which makes it slightly pricier than a lot of other lunchtime cafes nearby, but this setting is just so gorgeous I'd happily pay the difference.",

If you want to sit back and relax all afternoon, this might be okay.  Though it's noisy since they pack so many tables in there.  If you want a quick meal, look elsewhere.",

We waited 20 minutes to get served. It was a Saturday afternoon but they could at least got the drinks orders in. When the food finally came (45 minutes) it was great.  Worth the wait, not sure.",
