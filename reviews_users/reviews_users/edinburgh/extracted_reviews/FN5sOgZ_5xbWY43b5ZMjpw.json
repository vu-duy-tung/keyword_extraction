    "text": "This place looks extremely busy behind at the kitchen.  The kitchen is an open kitchen which may mean they are not afraid to show the cleanliness of the kitchen.  Upon arriving there are a few people waiting for their takeaway.  There were only about 6 tables and the seats were still stacked up with 2 tables where the dirty plates were still lying around. When we told them we need a table for 3, then they started cleaning the tables.  This establishment did not provide me with a good first impression as they failed to provide us with menus and there were flies flying around.  The menu however was extensive.  Seems like their specialty is grill and barbecue as the place was filled with smoke.   We had the mixed grill special for 2, Chapli kebab starter, fish pakora, peshwari naan and chappati.  I won't go into details for all of them as we ordered quite a lot.  I rate this place a 3 as I think I had better Indian food in Edinburgh.  The chicken and the lamb chops in the mixed grill were tough and dry.  Kebab was only so so and chicken wings was nice. The fish pakora was fresh but I felt a bit under seasoned and a bit overcooked.  Chapli kebab was also a bit bland. Overall I think the establishment provided food quality that was just enough to pass as Indian food. I didn't think there was anything spectacular about the food.",

    "text": "Yum. Yum. Yum.  Fantastic food!!! To be fair anywhere that char grills stuff is a winner I my book but the curries and the flame grilled things are equally tasty. Very unusual and varied menu too.  The butter handi is amazing as is the bhuna and Palak.   I have used them for takeaway many times and twice to  sit in ( byo) I wouldn't recommend sitting in for dinner as the service was pretty much non existent (45 mins between poppadoms and starters) and very cold due to the door being wide open during December. It was also cold when I popped in  for lunch.  The food is excellent though and please do order takeaway!",

    "text": "So, Desi Pakwan is a bit of a strange one. Their menu is vast and encompasses an impressive range of Indian dishes, but also a BBQ grill selection including burgers and steaks. Their chips are absolutely tremendous, too, and where else in the city can you get BBQ liver tikka? They have some additional specials on at weekends, which I'm assured are very good, too. But the premises are really strangely configured and not the most welcoming for dining in, so I'd definitely point you in the direction of taking away rather than sitting-in.  Overall, we said: \"Desi Pakwan is a fairly odd little place. The quality on offer is surprisingly good given the impression the haphazard interior creates. Our scoring below doesn't make it sound too promising, but I'd definitely recommend that you give it a shot as a takeaway place as I think you'll be pleased with what you'll get. I'd be happy to visit again, to sample further dishes from their menu.\"",
