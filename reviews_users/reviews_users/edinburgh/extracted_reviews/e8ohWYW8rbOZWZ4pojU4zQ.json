    "text": "I sang karaoke in here once when it was The World, or at least I think that was its name. I'm not sure if the karaoke nights still exist, but the place has certainly been revamped to quite a large extent, and is going for the classy wine bar feel, rather than traditional pub vibe.   In deceivingly quite large premises on Thistle Street, Bon Vivant has the dark and mysterious, candlelit thing going on really well. I've been in here with a few friends for after work, midweek drinks, which went down pretty nicely, and the dimmed lighting and relaxed atmosphere makes you feel nice and warm and slouchy, so you get the impression that chilling with a drink for a few hours won't be a problem. Why does it seem that in some bars it would be a problem? Hmmm, in any case, there is a good selection of wines here, plus a more than average number of champagnes available by the glass, great if you're parched and feel like a glass of fizz would fill the void, but don't necessarily want to splash your whole night's funds on a bottle.",

I chose the Wellington for my main and hardly a word left my mouth as I stuffed it with crispy pastry, beef and the most delicious pate topping AMAZING!   The bar and restaurant were rammed, but the atmosphere was really chilled. The drinks menu was also fantastic and cheap!  This is definitely on my places to re-visit when I'm in Edinburgh next!",

    "text": "Okay, so I went here last night.. and I loved it!!!  First, the staff are super friendly and always smiling. They definitely made me feel welcome. Our waiter took the time to explain the menu for us, and was very helpful by arranging our meal to be brought out in the desired order my friend and I wanted (we might have ordered pretty much everything)   So I tried out all the bites except for two, and had some of them in the 3 starter size, all of them to share. They were really quick at keeping our table nice and orderly (we honestly had so many plates), but didn't seem intrusive.   I liked the food a lot too. I'd have to say my favourite starter was the Mackerel. yum.   So even with ordering 4 starters, 1 bite, and a side of garlic potatos, we might have still been a bit peckish. So if you're the type to want to try EVERYTHING because you're indecisive like me. I'd recommend to still order a main and a couple bites. After we had finished what we ordered, instead of going for dessert we went for the chorizo and bread to fill us up.   All in all, the bites are really bites, but the food is great and i loved the atmosphere. I'd definitely consider going back again. The tapas style really is quite fun!!",

We chose food from the bites menu, 1 each. Obviously as the names suggests they were literally bites. But you can order some, then order more if you are still hungry. I had breaded brie with pesto, haggis balls, black pudding, squid and i couldn't fault any of it.   Basically i can't wait to go back as they just left me wanting more! :)",

This place is incredibly cosy, comfortable, full of character and has an amazing air of romance about it. It is the sort of place you see yourself settling down for the evening with a nice wine (the choice is very extensive), some nibbles (which looked devine) and then suddenly checking your watch and the hours have flown by! A good place to come with someone special. I would totally come back here, it may not meet this over the top hollywood-style liaison I have mapped out in my mind but coming here would be a damn good start!",

    "text": "I want to give Bon Vivant 3.5 stars but Yelp won't let me, and I can't quite bring myself to up my review to 4 stars.    Yesterday was our very first Edinburgh Yelpers Massive.  We had a whopping turnout of 3 Yelpers (myself included) with two Canadian non-Yelpers in attendance.  The plan was to go enjoy the couches and cocktails in Underdogs but for some unexplained reason, it was closed.    So, we headed to Bon Vivant, just around the corner.    When we walked in from the bright day I was immediately hit with how DARK it is inside.  That's all well and good when it's dark or dusky outside but seems a bit extreme in the middle of the afternoon.  We were immediately greeted by a waiter who handed us a wine list told us that while we were welcome to sit at any of the tables generally reserved for diners, we might need to vacate if the table was needed.  I thought that was completely fair and very nice of him to let us know the low-down ahead of time.    A couple of us got the beers in and I was very pleased to find that the mugs were refrigerated which made the beer that much tastier.   It didn't quite warrant paying 3.60 for said beer, but I guess that's what you have to pay in New Town these days.    We had a great time chatting away about the kind of topics you don't normally bring up with people you've not met before, but then I can't really give the bar credit for that.    I've heard very good things about the food and the fact that the portions are served in \"normal\" sizes as well as 1 and 2 tapas sizes sounds like a great idea.    But even after all of that I just can't bring myself to give it 4 stars.  I think the problem is that it's maybe just a little too posh for me, a little too stuffy.  The staff aren't stuffy mind you, so it must be the decor I'm commenting on.  It's not very comfortable, you don't feel like you could stay for hours and hours.  At least, I don't.    So I stand by my 3.5 stars but will definitely go back and try some of those tasty looking tapas at which point you will be hearing from me again.",

    "text": "After discovering the Bon Vivant as an escape from crowded George Street bars on a Saturday afternoon, the first visit was purely for a late afternoon glass of wine. It's intimate atmosphere is the perfect place to relax and catch up over a few glasses of wine but can get very busy from around 5.30pm onwards. A great wine list is available, showcasing an excellent range of wines and champagnes to suit different budgets and the provision of water without it being requested, is a nice touch.   We were intrigued by the offers of 'little bites' to then book a table for dinner which did not disappoint.  A small but varied menu offers lots of choice of seasonal produce with meat, fish and vegetarian options available and for anyone with special dietary requirements, then the staff are more than willing to accomodate you (I'm GF and never been poisoned thanks to the very knowledgeable staff). Past options have included pork and lamb (none of which I would normally order but have been divine) but the little bites, which can include calamari, whitebait, haggis, haloumi and many other choices, are a great way to sample multiple little dishes tapas style and start from only 1. Dessert is a must and the chocolate mousse is to die for! I am a huge fan of The Bon Vivant and have introduced both local friends (as a non Edinburgh native) and also visitors who always suggest a return visit when planning their trip. Staff are friendly and attentive without being intrusive. The initimate atmosphere may suggest a romantic meal but equally, anytime I have been in there have been larger groups of friends in too. Only piece of advice - book in advance!",

Well, get over it and go for a full roast at Bon Viv's. It'll be better than any fry up you can make yourself and makes you feel warm and fuzzy like you've just been born.  An unreasonable amount of perfectly cooked meat (other options for you too, veggies), the crispiest roast potatoes and veg like something from an M&S ad (the slow mo one, not the one with that guy talking about girls in knickers)  To avoid all disappointment when it comes to pudding - for once, you can have everything as for the costly sum of 1 you can have a little portion. I highly recommend having a trio, because hopefully like you, I have no concern for the size of my arse as my priorities lie with my taste buds.  Thank you, Bon Vivant. I love you.",

The service was really on to it although the particular server didn't seem super confident in knowing the wine we asked about she recommended the one we were looking at and it was delicious. We ordered the lamb appetizer, which did take a wee bit of time to come out considering they weren't busy, but it was tasty when it arrived. I can get what some other reviewers mean but them being a bit cold, the bartender didn't greet us and seemed out out when I asked for a wine list, but the girls serving were nice. I will come back and try to have another go as I do love wine bars and it is a nice place to bring friends.",

With a good wine menu (perhaps slightly over-priced IMO) and a good combination of food this place is a winner for a number of eventualities. Post Friday drinks and nibbles = tick, Sunday Prosecco and nibbles = tick, mid-week casual date option = tick!  The staff are good, know the menu and know their drinks, the ambiance is nice, the music seems to be chosen by some of the rather ecclectic staff so can be a bit hit/miss but overall a great member of the Thistle St bistro scene.

I was very pleasantly surprised as I actually had it down as a super posh boozer, but it was just a really nice, comfy pub with just a little bit of understated class. Ooh La La!  They sell 31 wines by the glass, and seven different kinds of bubbly, including Krug champagne. I just plumped for a glass of red (well, my wallet did) and the barmaid/waitress recommended a nice Rioja to me, so who was I to argue? A large glass of wine and a pint only came to around 8, which I thought was great value, especially with the charming surroundings.  I noticed that the bar bites all cost 1, and looked absolutely yummy, including things like arancini's (my absolute fave!)  We visited on a Sunday afternoon and the smell of the Sunday dinners being served up was almost too much, so we left, but will definitely be back, maybe for some food the next time!",

A dreary Monday night, we sat down right away, glad to be warm in a pretty room, but after that our friends the staff didn't seem to pay strong attention to us and our order.  We told the waitstaff we were starving and that this was why we ordered bread along with our pork belly appetizer (which was delicious), cod main dish and boiled potatoes side.  After the pork belly was eaten we sat there, mentioned our bread several times to the staff who came around to move the plates.  Apparently our request didn't get passed up the line and we didn't see our actual waitress again or any bread until the main dish arrived -- which was nicely cooked and tasty -- forty minutes later.  Wish we'd sent it back as the white floury bread was terrible and redundant at that point since we had the potatoes.  At two pounds fifty, certainly not worth it....  Everyone was pleasant and kind and the food was okay, the wines delicious.  However, a bit more focus on us would have left us a lot happier.  We went for dessert at Fishers across Thistle Street to make ourselves feel a better and told each other we wished we'd eaten there, instead....  And the music was a bit weird ... pure electric guitars... I thought it was an emergency vehicle at one point.",

The bar has a pleasant atmosphere and we very much enjoyed the food, which was very reasonably priced - good, honest grub. The starters and puds are split so you can buy a bite size for a pound or so or a portion for 3 or 4 pounds. We split 5 of the bite starters between three of us and enjoyed the variety. Did the same for the puddings which were delicious, although I'm not sure I'd order the strawberry and basil cheesecake again, it certainly was an interesting taste. Looking forward to going back.",

My friend opted for the Matinee cocktail which was a gorgeous concotion of rum mixed with kaffir lime leaves and some other items i can't remember nor can i find a cocktail list on their website to tell me...  i did have a taste of the cocktail and thought it was so good i ordered one as soon as i finished my wine!  the restaurant portion of this bar is lovely with a sort of gothic chic design.  the food menu is quite clever as all their starters come in two sizes, a start portion or a bite portion.  the bites are each 1 and it's a great way to try a few of the tasty starters they have on offer.  we ordered the crispy prawns, the breaded brie with pesto, the falafel with a chili and pumpkin sauce, and queenie scallops with garlic butter.  all of these were delicious and just the right size to enjoy as a nibble while having drinks.  the bites were also the perfect size to leave us with room to have a look at their dessert menu.  we shared a portion of the chocolate mousse with caramel and a quince and pear crumble with a side of pear ice cream.  both of these were absolutely delicious and were quickly polished off!!  the perfect end to our time at bon vivant and our catch up.  it was also good timing as the table was reserved, but i have to say that helpful staff never rushed us to leave which i thought was a nice touch.  my last comment about bon vivant is that the drinks may be a bit more expensive than other bars, but everything else on their menu is incredibly good value!  the bites at a 1 are so good and the desserts were only 4 for a size that was big enough to share.  it's also worth noting that their desserts also come in a 1 bite size.  and really, the cocktails are so good they're totally worth the price!!  looking forward to another visit some time in the near future :)",

Really great looking, atmospheric bar. Quite dark and moody looking, makes me think it would definitely be a better night time, dinner option than lunch.   There was no tables available when we arrived so we got set up at the bar for a 45 minute wait, which totally flew by thanks to the great music, chatty bar staff and great drinks. I had a cocktail from their extensive and unusual list and my boyfriend had an absolutely brilliant Icelandic pale ale which I thoroughly recommend.   When we got seated, we ended up trying the haggis, croquettes, squid, and crab and crayfish cocktail. They really are just small canape style snacks but that was exactly what we needed. All very tasty, the croquettes were definitely the best thing on the plate. Squid a bit chewy, and I'm fairly certain the haggis was actually black pudding.   We then went on to G&T's, speak to the bartenders about your gin preference. They are very knowledgable, enthusiastic and eager to help you pick out something different.   All in all, great place and I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "Ok so I feel like I may get shot down in flames for saying this but I find Bon Vivant so disappointing...the first time I entered this place it was fab. Not overly packed, good service and nice drinks but since returning several times over the past few years I've left each time feeling glum after the experience. I apologise to all the diehard fans of this place but each time it was packed to the rafters, the service at the bar was quick but typically cold and rude and the cocktails really off in taste....I will no doubt find myself tagging along in the near future with some of the diehard fans of this place and I hope my mind will be changed but for now I'd rather try somewhere else :-S *Don't worry diehards, if my mind does change I'll update my review ;)",

A few of the appetizers were fried (spring roll and samosa) but they were not too hot to eat, nor did they shatter. They were both fried just right as to be crispy.  The harissa and pork belly were also both excellent -- maybe slightly salty on the harissa.  Compared to other nearby restaurants I tried this has much nicer and more modern food at a similar price, so the value is definitely superior as well.",

    "text": "Woweee,  Despite recommending people head here a bunch this was my first visit to Bon Vivant. I genuinely didn't even actually know where it is, but we were in that end of town looking for a table for 6 after some drinks with work and I suggested heading along. We were STARVING and THIRSTY.  In we went and first impressions were that if you wanted a cosy drink, or to eat with friends then this was the place to be. It was a tad dark in that I couldn't see what was in the fridges, but I got over that rather quickly. The staff were really friendly and clearly really enjoy working there which is always good to see.   We were seated after about 10 minutes which considering we just wandered up at 9pm on a Thursday isn't at all bad. Olives and bread ordered (tasty) and eaten, we ordered mains and more drinks.  **ISSUE BREAK** My two main issues with this place 1) beer - get some bloody decent beer in. San miguel is alright but a decent craft beer wouldn't have gone amis. NOT INNIS AND GUNN - you're a restaurant not a sweetie shop. Something like Cesar Augutus from williams brothers or Schiehallion on keg would have been spot on. Light, fruity, refreshing.   2) Toothpicks - get some wooden ones. The plastic ones for the olives were annoying.  **/ISSUE BREAK**  Now we're done with that.   Food - most of us ordered a magnificent roast lamb with mushrooms and ducks hearts. Oh my word it was awesome. I don't even want to describe it as no doubt the menu will have changed, it changes daily, so just trust me when I say put their food, in you, NOW.   Staff were attentive and smiley, water glasses were refilled almost scarily quickly.  All in all it was an awesome venue.  recommended.",

I probably showed myself up with my ignorance of cocktails, their ingredients, serving paraphernalia, names and sizes, but a drink was ordered and a drink was drunk. Sadly my cocktail didn't come in a small metal bucket, but my fellow drinker's did so I was at least able to enjoy that vicariously. (Mine was in a glass that reminded me of something my socially aspirational gran would have had in her sideboard. It was called an 'Elderflower Gimlet'. (The drink that is, not the glass. Or my gran: she was call Win. 'Elderflower Gimlet for the Win'?))  3.5 stars would perhaps have summed up my sense of ease in the place, but we'll go the four because it was a birthday celebration, and the bar tender and waitress were both very kind. I drink cocktails even less frequently than I have hot drinks (combined totals in 2013: 3 thus far), so giving more stars also means I got better value for money, right?  I shall be back, but it'll take a birthday to get me there I suspect.",

It has the cosy boozer vibe down but without straying too far into old-man-pub territory. The quirky historic decor on the walls and dimly lit atmosphere help with this - it'll actually probably be too dark for some people's liking but I loved the romantic touch of having candles everywhere. It's particularly nice when you duck in from the cold and rain outside! We popped in in quite a large group which they handled well when we took over most of the bar area. The guy behind the bar was wonderfully patient when my colleagues kept changing their drinks orders and was also happy to give me some ale advice. I'd like to come back in a smaller group or cosy up with a date here - it seems like a fine choice for a pre/post dinner drinks stop on this side of town and I spotted some yummy-looking bar tapas being ordered too...",

Their all day menu, showcasing a range of \"bite\" starters, ranges from 1 for a bite, to the mid-teens for main courses. The quality remains high, throughout.  Overall, we said: \"the Bon Vivant serves really impressive food, in lovely surroundings. The service couldn't be friendlier, but could be a trifle speedier. But for a relaxed lunch in a smart pub setting, there are few better places in our fair city. Bravo, chaps - I enjoyed my visit very much.\"",

They have a lovely range of aperitif martini cocktails at a reasonable price which you can sip in the comfy seats near the front. The food is lovely, fresh and Scottish fusion I would say, reasonably priced too. I only went to that place once but cannot wait to go back. With an intimate decor, it's a great place for a romantic night or just for a drink and food with a couple of friends.  I have only been during the week but I believe the place must get quite busy at weekends. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "We spent a lovely evening here last night, catching up with family long not-seen. I'll echo other reviews in noting that the bites are a great idea, and as a person who likes to try everyone elses food, I got to indulge that in having a selection of bites to myself. Breaded brie - too strong for my tastes, overpowering the tomato salsa that is was accompanied by; fish dumping - tasted fabulous and I could have eaten 10 more; charred halloumi with some seriously tasty (nut-free) basil pesto. The SR checked out the haggis bonbons with chipshop sauce (chipshop sauce not as good as the real deal apparently), and my nephew loved the lamb offering.   For the mains... I'll admit, I was surprised. Given that the bites are truly bites, I didn't expect the portion sizes to be as big as the mains were - not massive, but solid cuts of fish and meat were on display at the table. Most of us tucked into the John Dory, which was cooked beautifully with a seared diver scallop (so tender, it was embarrassing how much I enjoyed it) and a wild salad... the nephew had the sea trout with a solid serving of mussels, and the SR had the pork belly... which disappeared almost instantaneously as it arrived. Triple-cooked Chips (cooked in veg. oil) were fantastic, and the only downside was some nasty tasting asparagus (felt like they had been burned by garlic... didn't taste right personally, but my sister and her friend both enjoyed it).   Of course we had to have dessert as well, and the bite size came in handy, as I really only wanted a little sample rather than a whole dessert of the chocolate and raspberry tart... and the richness of the dish really meant that bite size was more than enough for me.   I think the only downside is that while the waiting staff were very friendly and pleasant, at times I felt pretty rushed, and while we were left to our own devices (despite being told we were supposed to vacate by 9... we left after 10), no-one really came by after dessert, so any prospect of drinks disappeared... not that we needed anymore - but it felt rather like a feast, then a famine. Otherwise, loved BV, liked the restaurant, would love to visit again.",

    "text": "I went here for date night with my sweetie while in Edinburgh and was thoroughly impressed. This little hole in the wall was just perfect - cozy atmosphere, wonderful drink selection that included inventive cocktails and a decent wine list, a creative menu with delicious appetizers, entrees and deserts. The servers were also incredibly knowledgeable and spot-on. I went with all the waitress's recommendations and was not at all disappointed.  I love their menu layout. The appetizers are available in two sizes: the \"nibbles\" are enough for a bite or two and run about 1 each and then there is a larger portion enough to share between two or three people depending on the amount of dishes ordered. We ordered a few nibbles and one larger appetizer and all were wonderful. The best dish of the night was the roast pork with onion marmalade. If I go back I am ordering two of them as my main course! Every once in a while you have a dish that just makes you go \"wow\" and smile from the inside out. Yes, this dish was that good. We also had little fried fish with mustard sauce which were great as well as fried haggis balls which my BF assures me were awesome but I am just not able to get behind.   Entrees were delicious as well. Liver and onions for the BF and duck for me. Both were tasty. Desert was also very good. They once again had the \"nibbles\" option for dessert which I really appreciate since I am usually too full for something big but like ending on a sweet note. We had petitfours which were more like truffles and extremely tasty. It was the perfect ending to a wonderful meal.",

The room is dimly lit, and there are comfortable chairs and candles throughout.  The atmosphere is cozy and intimate.    I had a glass of champagne first, from their very nice selection.  All their champagnes are dry - I had the sweetest one and it was still barely sweet at all but still very nice.  My next cocktail was basically an elderflower gin and tonic which I loved.  The last cocktail I had was something called the Dutch Courage (I think, can't find the list online) and it was my least favorite.  A strong orangey flavor in there that was a bit too cloying for me.  My boyfriend enjoyed his masculine cocktails and we both nibbled on tasty olives.  Though beware, the olives come literally in a bowl of oil - when you bring one up to your face, it will drip - on your trousers, as he learned!  The cocktails are indeed presented beautifully, with interestingly shaped ice cubes and clear precision from whoever is behind the bar.  I will say that we hoped they would be a bit stronger.  Two cocktails and champagne for me, three cocktails for him, and we both felt barely buzzed.  Not that the point is to be drunk, of course, but you know...would've been a plus!  But I suppose the good thing is that you can come and try lots of cocktails without being on the floor!  Prices were better than I thought too - champagne was pricey per glass but many of the cocktails were only 4 or 5 pounds.  Would return anytime for a drink and a snack!  So glad my friend told me about it as we could easily have walked right by!",

Bon Vivant has a wonderful intimate atmosphere, with dark paneled walls and candles in wine bottles on the tables. Being a French restaurant the wine choice was superb and the staff are very knowledgable about finding something to your preference. I like to think it's because they've gotten to taste all of that delicious wine!   Whilst the mains selection looked very tempting our table was swung over by the 'bites selection' which is very much a taster menu. Being the greedy guts that we are we all just wanted to try EVERYTHING so this was perfect for us. What was even better was that once you found something you really liked you could go on to order a slightly larger portion (sharing optional.) The menu changes often so it may not be available but I absolutely recommend the black pudding with homemade tomato relish, it's divine!   And best of all the puddings come in bite size portions too so you can easily try everything on that menu too!",

Although by appearance it is very romantic with dim lighting, candles and dark wood furnishings it is a great place to meet the girls for dinner or a drink or to have a quick meal.   I like the concept of this menu, a great wine/champagne menu paired with appetizers, small plates of mains and desserts (though there are few items that you can get as a main course). This way you can try lots of different dishes without committing to just one dish. I'm a huge sucker for variety and this is a great way to accomplish sampling whilst dining alone.  Another huge plus is that since there are small bites, the food comes out virtually instantly. Love it! I'm usually starving so the idea of ordering and it comes out right quick is very appealing. It's quicker than a fast food restaurant.  The only drawback I think to the menu is that although very tasty, most of the items are very indulgent - either deep-fried or in pastry. I know the portions are small, but when you add them up, so do the calories and fat. However, it's not say that the food was not excellent because it was.  To top off a wonderful meal, the wait staff was very friendly and accommodating.",

Our waiter recommended fabulous drinks based on our preferences and the food was delicious. We ordered a series of the Bites and each was a thoughtful creation of flavour and texture. The sweet corn Panna Cotta with subtle garlicky back notes and the chorizo and smoked cheese croquettes were stand outs for me. Interestingly, the only dish that wasn't great was the chips! I think the oil might not have been hot enough as they were a little soggy and oily.  Although bordering on full, we chose to press on and shared a main. And how glad we were. The apple smoked duck with hazelnuts and cherry was a smokey punch in the face but delightfully so. Often when a dish is described as smoked you really have to search for it, but this was by far the smokiest dish I've eaten. The richness of the duck the perfect vehicle for the smoke, and the cherries brightening up the whole dish. Superb.",

    "text": "I wanted my friend who was visiting Scotland for the first time to try some Scottish food, but wanted her to also try a variety so I chose this place since they served up Scottish type tapas.   Bon Vivant is a dark, sexy, loud, but intimate type restaurant/bar. The tables are small and the space is tight but the place has really great energy. It offers amazing small dishes and also main. The small plates varies and include haggis balls, arancini (Italian rice balls), pork belly, chorizo, and many more. One piece cost 2 and 6 for 3 pieces. The bigger portion can be around 8-9. Their main courses cost around 15-20. I prefer ordering the small bite dishes cause you can try many different types and they are truly tasty. The haggis balls sits on a sweet Asian style pepper sauce and the combination works very well. The pork belly was my favourite. It's decadent, flavourful (from the fat) and satisfying. One bite of it was more than enough unless you want to over indulge.   They have extensive drinks menu which includes beers, red/ white wine, and many different types of cocktails. Their cocktails are strong, tasty, and creative.   The staff are quick and helpful. The place isn't the best place to take someone on a date unless your both comfortable shouting at each other cause it can get loud. This is a great place to go with friends while enjoying good food and drinks.",

Of note: Portions were healthy, except the gnocchi, which came with 6 pieces. Normally expecting a bowl full, but the taste and veggie made for a filling experience.    The Venison was 3 healthy pieces and was a great experience.    The trout was something we thought looked like salmon.  Again a solid portion all tasty     The wait between courses was a bit longer than expected, but the place was packed.",

We enjoyed sitting at the bar and watching them make cocktails.   I highly recommend anyone to pop in for a drink. It's a perfect place for date night.",

Look for the blue doors and walk into a low lit bar with lots of places to sit and or stand and sip a cocktail or few.   The menu is extensive and there are a few bearded bar tenders mixing up a great variety of cocktails. There are cocktail specials on the boards and an extensive cocktail menu.   They do serve food here however as we did not eat here cannot comment on the food. The crowd is generally a little bit older and probably over 25 rather than under.   I would happily come back here for an evening with friends and spend a lot of money trying different cocktails. It's not cheap but well worth the money.   The service is excellent and they even replaced one of the cocktails on a mere notion that it did not taste right. They did go our of their way to please and that is always a hallmark of a good bar.",

    "text": "After my fifth visit in this dark, decadent drinking hole, I thought it was high time I reviewed one of my favourite bars in Edinburgh. They've really embraced the dark, eerie buildings that the cobbled roads of thistle street offer, and not tried to modernise or lighten it in any way which I love. With dark grey walls, beveled mirrors and candle light adorning the bar, it's one of those places that you could stay in for hours. Sunday's they play a mixture of singer-songwriter indie acoustic music, which makes it feel a more chilled out vibe that Sunday's are all about.   If the atmosphere in the Bon Vivant isn't enough, the cocktails really are stupendous. Hand crafted expertise isn't quick, but I'm glad that the drinks here are never rushed, even on a busy Saturday night. They offer a diverse menu of fantastic drinks ranging from whiskey based hard hitters to the more delicate gin based cocktails that match the pretty girls drinking them. They also have specials which change regularly on a black board opposite the bar, which are great for locals to try something new.   I've eaten here once or twice, and the food is good, but the five stars I'm awarding is purely for drinks. My advice is drink your fill here, then nip across the road for some delicious tacos at El Cartel. It's the perfect way to spend any day, with fabulous drink, and fabulous food.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place, but it didn't do it for me, I was quite disappointed. We went here for a nice dinner but left still hungry!   The atmosphere is beautiful, dark, romantic and has a good buzz. Unfortunately, this buzz was ruined by Octoberfest drunks, who were luckily just leaving as we arrived, but were quickly replaced by a group of 30 freshers at the bar. I get it's Saturday night and people want a drink, but the Bon Vivant can't both be a cute restaurant and a loud student bar. Either refuse the large group or change your venue to a bar.   I wanted to drink an alcohol free beer as I'm doing a sober October, but they didn't have any. Really? The staff was in a hurry and didn't offer me a drinks menu, nor an alternative, so I just ordered a coke. I would've gladly had a virgin cocktail or a more exciting soda, as I know they probably do them!   Food arrived quite late, the nibbles (now 2 each) were OK. I had the tiny venison burger and crab cocktail. Not very exciting to be honest, the burger was incredibly plain, dry and hardly had any sauce. The crab cocktail was a little better.   After this, our mains were delivered and I was stunned. I ordered trout with seafood and a cauliflower puree, assuming this would be a full main. The piece of trout was very small, maybe a handful of seafood and the cauliflower puree wasn't a side - it was 3 small dollops of sauce. I literally did not expect that the food would come out in incredibly small Michelin style sizes. For 20 a plate, I didn't think I had to order a side to be full. The flavours weren't amazing, the fish was dry, the seasoning was off.   After asking for my partner's wine (twice) and for the bill (twice) I was quite done with the restaurant. In my opinion, they need to do one of two things: really go upmarket, make their food a little better and just have people dining, without any people standing at the bar. Or they could lower their prices/double the portions and become more of a middle-weight bar-type restaurant. What they're doing now is trying to do both, and it just isn't happening for me.",

    "text": "Meh. If you like beards and waistcoats, are very into the current trend for drinking fancy gins, and would maybe stretch as far as to say you had hipster tendencies this is probably the bar for you. Don't get me wrong - there's nothing the matter with any of these things. I just felt that it was trying a bit too hard.   We were only here for one drink so I will condense my usual essays into a few sentences. Good things involved an extensive drinks menu, attentive service, and I really liked that the servers brought iced water as soon as you sat down (I always feel cheap asking for tap water but often like to quench my thirst before I sip a tasty beverage). Prices were fine, more expensive than your regular old man pub but nothing really over the top. And the staff were super nice.  Bad things included having a wine/cocktail/mixers type list that had every type of drink imaginable EXCEPT any of the draft or bottled beers, ciders or softs. Just because you serve fancy cocktails doesn't mean everyone wants fancy cocktails all the time! It was also pretty dark inside on what was otherwise a fairly bright day, but if you prefer to start drinking early and keep going late then that probably won't bother you. On this occasion we were waiting for a friend to arrive for dinner so when we stepped outside it took a while for eyes to readjust, and that was at 6pm so it was a tad dusky.   But then again this is the bar owned by the same people that own El Cartel, the wee mexican restaurant across the road. For that alone I would give it another half-star because the linking of the two venues across the lane from each other is rather lovely - if you can't get a table in EC when you arrive they will tell you that they will come and fetch you from BV if you want to stop in for a drink.   I wouldn't rush back but if I was in the vicinity I wouldn't avoid it either. Just so-so really.",
