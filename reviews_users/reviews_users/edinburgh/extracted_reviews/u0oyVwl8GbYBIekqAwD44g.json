Our orders were on the table so quickly one might think it was prepared in advance but everything was so fresh... Kudos to the chef.  Oh the food... It was just fabulous! Every dish was just perfect.   Highly recommended a great experience and a welcoming ambience.",

Their cocktails were so amazing I had three different ones.   I wanted to go back but we were only there for two nights and wanted to try some different places!  So delicious.",

    "text": "If I walked in and was given the fries alone I would give this place 5 stars. Those fries are well seasoned and I loved the hoisin mayo they got going on.   Just went in for some snacks and a couple of drinks but definitely will be coming back for the food and more. The smell was intoxicating with all the spices and flavours in the air. It had me and my girlfriend saying \"I wonder what they ordered\" and grabbing the menu to figure it out.   The atmosphere is nice and chill but the service was fantastic. We were at the bar and had a good few chats with the owner and Jared the barman. They were friendly and attentive to everyone that walked in and helpful with decisions on the menu.   We had a couple of cocktails and the selection is a combination of classics with a oriental twist. The martini was alcoholic and delicious.   All in all: drinks great, atmosphere chilled, food tempting but the fries! Have I mentioned the fries???   Definitely hit it up if you're about the area",

We mainly ordered from the wee things section of the menu, sharing lots of dishes between the three of us. My favorites were the fried tofu and the veggie haggis wontons. Everything was tasty.   Service is friendly, and the atmosphere is cozy.  Good selection of bottled beers.",

The service was incredibly friendly and I was touched by the Chef/owner sincere interest in taking care of the customers.    Highly recommend.",

The squid, chicken wings, spicy beef on lettuce leaf etc, all brilliant. Had king prawn dish with rice and a lovely sauce - sorry can't remember the exact dish now but top class. Think I'll pop back here with my wife and kids to have another shot.",

Probably safe to say I have found my new local! Having brought someone different each time, I think I might have found a few peoples new local.  The wee Buddha has a rest bar vibe to it with incredibly friendly service. Only trumping the service is the amazing food. It's evident a huge amount of thought has been invested into the food. My personal favourites are the wings, pork belly and chips!  My new local! Will be back soon!",

    "text": "Like others have said, Asian with a Scottish twist and I enjoyed it and would be happy to return.   Everything is cooked fresh so they can accommodate dietary requirements so gluten free me was a happy bunny! They are also working on sourcing a coeliac friendly soy sauce which would be used across all dishes so thumbs up!   Being gluten free, I didn't share with the rest of the table who got the evil stuff. I loved the salt and chilli squid which was perfectly cooked and totally gluten free. My prawn Singapore noodles were a-ok, not mind blown wow but left me with a happy tummy.  Estrella Dura gf beer is available here which is a nice touch. We split the bill as there were 5 of us but I think the squid was around 7.50 and the noodles around 9 so not a wallet busting meal.   I'll go back :-)",
