But what sets it apart is that you can enjoy all this in their special kids area at the back, complete with toys, books, and even a micro for heating your bottle. A real oasis on those shopping days down town, or to meet up with other parents.",

    "text": "This pub is definitely owned by people who are integrated into their community and understand what their customers, many of whom are students, want.  As soon as you walk in it feel clean and well organised, and on the walls there are plenty of adverts for events including charity auctions and and a weekly jog on Tuesdays at 7pm to a place called Sofi's and back again.  I'm not entirely sure why they do this, but it apparantly attracts quite a crowd. Apart from this, the drinks are well priced and the service is friendly and effective.  The food is proper gastropub stuff with posh poached eggs on ciabatta toast and a wide selection of crepes.  I had a smoked salmon sandwich with salad which cost 5.  This seems a lot, but it was a good portion which provided a filling meal in itself.   Joseph Pearce does excellent business and you only have to visit once to understand why.",

Where as I would not *normally* go for potato salad and (normal) salad with my meatballs, J.P. did and it works well. Other meals on the table included an aubergine steak and a chicken-with-chorizo dish (which actually looked small compared to the other mains served). Of note is that even though we had a dinner reservation time of around 7pm, many of the mains (three out of the six or so on offer) had already sold out - annoying to say the least..  Service was OK, a little hit and miss. One waiter was awesome, the other one disappeared at random and we ended up having to go down to the bar to order drinks back up to our table.  No kids-books-disguised menus during our visit, just (not enough) drink menus.. had to track one down on many an occasion :|  But, all in all, good food ... service _could_ have been better, but it's a pub, so...",

It would probably consider itself a pub first and a cafe / eatery second, but the standard of food served here is honestly better than most of the restaurants I have visited in the city. Top-class stuff. During the day there is a section at the rear of the bar dedicated to customers with young children, something I hadnt seen before and thought I would hate, but it actually creates a really friendly, cheerful atmosphere in the bar.   There are often events like art auctions and baking competitions held here, which although twee sounding, help add a unique flavour to the place and really help Pearce's stand out from the crowd. Great for a drink or a bite to eat on a sunny afternoon, as well as a relaxing pub to unwind in during the evening.",

Having lived in Sweden for two years, I noticed the sign outside advertising Swedish cider. Many restaurants offer that these days, but once you step in you can't miss the large Swedish flag and paraphernalia on the walls.  The menu is a clever mix of Swedish pancakes, cured salmon and a smorgasbord, and some more general European dishes such as Barcelona salad and tiger prawns with gazpacho!   Jonathan Pearce is quite large, and the rooms near the rear are very nicely decorated. They hold several theme events throughout the year and my friend and I are anxious to go to an all day barbecue there this weekend!",

I have always wanted to go here and when I arrived in all honesty, I was not quite sure what to make of the place. It was pretty busy and I was huddled by the door, and not too happy about it! But we did manage to get a table! And I managed to nab myself a wee rocking seat in the corner..... old age, here I come!  The drinks selection here is good but it is a little on the Pricey side. I bought an elderflower cider ( which was lovely and would recommend, much better tha the Kopparberg version I have had) and a pint of Stella, or something like that. I got little to no change from a tenner. The surroundings are great, comfortable, quirky and cosy. The menu sounds tasty and I would come back to sample something! The mix of people was a little odd, but other than I enjoyed my drinks here and would come back but I wouldn't spend a whole evening here, I couldn't afford it!",

I'll have the JP Smorgasbord.\"  Good choice.  The variety plate was chock full of tastiness, and the Gravad Lax salad Joe ordered was out of this world.  Not the cheapest lunch I've enjoyed here in Edinburgh, but a light and delicious meal shared with friends on the outdoor patio under the shiniest sun we've seen in this side of the Atlantic.

    "text": "I really like this pub, although I immediately feel the need to qualify that statement. It has its detractors, and their criticisms are valid, but like any successful brand, its smugness is the price you have to pay for the quality of the product. So I guess that makes JP's the iPod of pubs.  First, the good. It's big, nicely decorated, has a variety of seating, from couches to tables, and they have a variety of international beer. Only one real ale on handpull though, which is a bit of a travesty in Edinburgh, but they have some in bottles. Most Edinburghers will be familiar with this Swedish theme shtick (they also own Victoria's, Boda Bar and Sofi's), but what can I say, it works.  Then the bad. It's ridiculously overpriced. At 4.40 a pint, it must be the most expensive pint in Edinburgh (for a pub), making London look reasonably priced. I really can't believe I would pay that much for a pint, but when you're on Leith Walk and looking for a good pub, or a handy meeting place, or you want to park your fixed wheel bike, sink into a couch and whip out your MacBook, then this is the place. Hang on, didn't I just say I liked it here?  Another downside is the noise. There's something about the acoustics there that makes it really hard to hear what people are saying. Or maybe that's just my age. What?!  They also do food. I've never eaten there, but I've heard it's good. During the day it's a yummy mummy hangout, with a play area and light lunches. One of their quirks is to put the menus in old Disney comics. I was a bit embarrassed once when a waitress asked if I was ready to order but I wasn't looking at the menu; I was reading the Donald Duck comic!  So yes, it's smug, expensive and tends to be frequented by 30-something middle class people. But it's big, beautiful and central. I think a few years ago I would have said it was too posh and up itself. But now I'm a sad 30-something and I like it. Hey, it has wifi and Birra Morretti on tap. Now where's my iPod?",

If you could imagine a pub that knows its clientel, and aims to keep them - its Joseph Pearce.  The food is splendid, and while may seem over priced, it is actually good value for money - not only does it taste great, there are some whopping portions as well. The decor is relaxed and stylish, while the staff are friendly and welcoming. Drinks are a tad on the expensivce side, but there is a large selection and you always get the good stuff when you ask for a spirit and mixer.

The space feels lovely and airy upon entering, with nice relaxing music on the stereo. Fantastically individual atmosphere with birdcages hanging from the ceiling and interesting artwork adorning the walls. Staff seem friendly enough, if a bit impersonal; I ordered my black coffee at the bar, was given a menu (bound in a hardback copy of Disney's Beauty & the Beast no-less), and took my seat.   Coffee is from Artisan Roast on Broughton St, so I wasn't surprised to taste a superbly balanced cup. Marvellous.   I ordered the burger to eat. Extras such as cheese and bacon are available on the menu from 0.50 to 1, but I ordered it 'as it comes'. No mention of accompanying fries or potato wedges is made on the menu so I held my breath. I thought \"Surely for 8, I'll get fries AND a cherry on top!\".   I got out my laptop to do some work while I waited. The free wifi worked for a few minutes before chucking me off and ceasing to function.   My burger arrived accompanied by small, but lovely, rocket, tomato and olive salad. Fresh leaves and nicely dressed.   Besides the salad, there was nothing else on the plate apart from a hearty looking bun containing a burger, and a few wilting leaves.   No fries, no onion, no cherry on top!   \"Oh well\", I thought, \"the burger must taste excellent, surely, with an 8 price tag!\". To my disgust, the first bite revealed a barely cooked chunk of mincemeat.   Now I love my burger on the pink side, but this was a step too far.   At the second time of asking, my burger arrived and I ate, but it felt overcooked and tough this time. Perhaps finished in the microwave, to ensure no more raw meat mishaps? Who knows.   When I finished eating, I sat in front of the empty plate for fifteen minutes before I left. Surely 'good service' stops when your guests leave your establishment, not when you've just messed up their order and they're sitting at one of your tables!   I've eaten many vastly superior burgers in my days and paid less for the pleasure. The cheaper burgers all came with fries too!   Still waiting for a cherry on top though.   I probably wouldn't go back to this bar, certainly not to eat anyway. All in all, a crushing disappointment. Especially on a quiet Thursday afternoon.   High point - fantastic coffee from Artisan roast, tasty rocket with the burger.   Low point - leaving the place with that same bitter taste in the mouth you get when you've been mugged in broad daylight in a dodgy bar.",

But after it was bought over and refurbished it is now an exciting, trendy bar with beautiful decor and great food and drink. It is distinctly Swedish, with an exciting menu (cutely placed inside a childrens book), with much better than average pub food. Meatballs are the speciality but there are other dishes such as fishcakes and avocado salad.  By day, Pearces is a trendy cafe/bar with a specially set aside childrens area where parents can meet up, have a drink, and trust that their children will be amused with the selection of toys and books (there are even safety gates by the loos!) It's a great place to grab a coffee, and the wifi is an added bonus. By night, the lights go down and its a buzzing atmosphere with drinkers from all walks of life sampling the exciting drink menu, and chilling out on the sofas and cushions.  As one of the aforementioned drama students who loved Pearces before it went trendy, I was gutted when it changed. But now, having sampled the new, fun Pearces, I have to admit it has totally changed for the better! A great place to hang out!",

We both ordered the steak brunch which according to the menu comprised sweet potato rosti, black haggis and a 3 oz steak, topped with a poached egg for 9.70. Our food arrived quickly- it was a well presented plate with a decorative salad garnish around the small stack,  but our meal was completed quickly as well because unfortunately,we found the portion size was far from substantial. I guess the sweet potato rosti was meant to be the potato element of the dish but we both felt it would have benefited from some heartier accompaniment such as chips or even a basket of bread to fill us up. Everything was very tasty and well cooked although there was a bit of fat on the already tiny bit of steak. For that price, we really felt it was not very good value and we were actually both still hungry afterwards. On that basis, I don't think we'd eat there again although it looked like a nice place to sit with a drink.",

The atmosphere is relaxed and our table upstairs looked over the back garden; very pretty!

The terras is as sunny as ever , and if there is a chilling wind the colourful Ikea blankets are a great warmer and wind breaker.   The bar is always busy, but many of them are familiar faces - they truly live up to the moniker 'local'. The prices have increased since last year, but so have those over many other establishements.  The beers served are global brand and local brew side by side, so a Kronenburg 1664 and a Blue Moon is perfectly possible.   They also have their own Swedish ciders called Iduns and this is a joy to drink over ice when catching some sunshine.   This is to me a friendly neighbourhood pub & restaurant with some international allure.",

    "text": "I'll be honest, this will constitute quite a generic view for all the bars these guys run (Boda, Victoria and Joseph Pearce), but as it's closer to my house (and as such, more likely to find me inside) it will still be quite JP-centric...  All the bars have a very laid back atmosphere - it's nice and effortlessly cool in all of them. Many places try this, but end up falling into the \"trying too hard\" category; always a pet peeve of mine. (Treacle, I'm looking at you...)  There's even outdoorsy bits in them all too - great for our 3 days of sunshine a year. The space at JP's is quite large as well, perfect for people watching down the Walk.  Beer selection is great, and doesn't leave you feeling the need to take out a mortgage part way through the evening too, always a bonus in places that steer clear of the general Fosters-vapidness. They always have Tunnocks Wafers on all the bars as well, which I feel finally constitutes adequate compensation for the total lack of Vimto I've encountered since moving up a few years back.  Best of all though, is the epic brunch menu, which served up steak, egg, black pudding and hassleback spuds all on one plate. Winner! There's a very Scandinavian bent to all the dishes here, so makes a great change to all the repetitive Scottish/British hybrid menus we get elsewhere (don't get me wrong, I love the food, just a bit of variety is always welcome).  Overall, great bunch of pubs, with JP being the best for diners. Cue weekend beer-crawl",

I also like the decor and feel of the place - it's got a community vibe to it even though it's a boozer. Outdoor seating along Elm Row to boot.

It' a place for all occasions: After work, Christmas, New year, Birthdays, General celebrations - simply enjoying time with your friends.  The inside provides a very comfortable atmosphere. The staff is very friendly. Sometimes it takes a while to get served, but considering that the place is very popular, it's still within an acceptable time.  The drink and food prices are in alignment with city life. In the summer you have the opportunity to sit outside and watch people passing by.  I especially like the rocking chair in the back room. Funny one. It's a good place to take a group and share stories around or across the table.  Just lovely!",

So where do you go?  Being YF&S (well Y'ish' anyway), balmy nights like this would naturally lead me to George Street but I wandered down past The Omni and remembered a long lost love that didnt have a flat on Albert Street and a cat that hated me. This forgotten gem was of course a bar called 'Joseph Pearce'.  It had been 2009 since we last met and 'Joseph' had gone all 'Sven' since then.  The essentials remain the same though, cracking location especially on a night like this, a 'cool without trying too hard' interior and staff who are on the ball without being in your face.  Perfecto.  I ordered a bottle of House White which was Spanish, under 13 and perfectly quafable.  Ice Bucket in hand, I settled onto a Stool by the window to wait for my hastily texted friend and watched the party unfold in the outside seating area.  It is such a lovely space to do this, as airy and laid back a bar as you could ever want to visit with a clientele so mixed and interesting you should be barred if you dare web browse your smart phone rather than wonder what their stories are?  So why only three stars? Well, two reasons for losing two stars. Firstly the Gents Toilets are Grim with a capital Grim.  I appreciate that it is a limited and rather restricted space but it is just not good and a broken cubicle lock when there is only one anyway = fail.   Secondly the food just didnt rock my boat at all.  To accompany the second bottle of vino we had a selection of 3 starters to pick at, Tigers Prawns, Hasselback Potatoes and the obligatory Meatballs.  The 'tatties' were the highlight simply because they were cooked properly and had nice garlic mayo. The meatballs were 'yeah whatever' no better or worse than any supermarket could knock out. The 'mint and cucumber yoghurt' however reminding me of something the aforementioned cat might regurgitate.  The texture was more 'cucumber and mint in milky water'...which, whilst being no 'chef', I suppose is bound to happen given the water content of cucumber?  The Tigers were 'fine' but I do object to getting mine 'Headed & Whole' and therefore having to perform the equivilant of a crustacean autopsy just to get a mouthful of prawn.  In conclusion, a winning place with friendly staff to meet friends for drinks or hang out alone and watch the world go by.  However if you want to avoid the loo, you might also want to avoid the food!",

Exciting, trendy bar with beautiful decor. Floral, oriental-looking pillars, birdcages hanging from the ceiling, nice relaxing music on the stereo, free wifi, bright coloured cushions / sofas and interesting artwork for sale on the walls.  By day the pub is geared towards families, with a child area located on a raised platform to the left of the bar, which is filled with child's toys and places for them to draw.  And by night the bar is transformed into a funky social drinking night spot with dim lighting and groovy tunes. Serving their famous Iduns Swedish ciders and speciality spirits and beers. It has a laidback atmosphere and the staff are nice but maybe a bit impersonal at times?  There is always events on as well and they have a real community atmosphere much like their other bars. And the best bit... they give bright green blankets for when you sit outside.",

Heading up the stairs to your left, you come upon the bulk of the seating in what looks like a small alcove...that gets bigger and bigger!  The mood is relaxed, the decor helps with low lighting in the evenings.  Artwork that's all for sale adorns the walls and there's some kitschy cushions scattered around. The selection at the bar is pretty good and the usual drinks associated with the chain are, of course, available (hello elderflower cider!)   In the evenings you need to get there earlyish if you're with a group but if there's just one or two of you there'll be a few chairs knocking about. A definite 'meet your friends for a few mid-week' type of place.",

I don't think I ever went before its Swedish reincarnation - I gather it was a bit of a rough old place. That's hard to imagine now, with its lovely high ceilings and nooks and crannies. There's lots of shabby couches and quirky fittings, and it just feels a really comfortable place to be.   There are little cosy corners around the entrance/ bar area, and then a more open mezzanine above. There's a child friendly area down the back, too. I don't know how you'd get a pushchair up there - the stairs are steep and narrow - but there's a few toys and things to keep children amused.   It does tend to be where I go with girlfriends, in small groups - I think a big group would find it hard to get comfortably seated together, and it can be noisy. The beer selection's not the greatest either. So, hey, we're forced into getting a nice bottle of wine instead.  And the food! I almost forgot - the food is fantastic. You find the menu hidden in a Disney book on each table, and there's always a good range of interesting salads, hot sandwiches, and swedish meatballs. One eccentric touch is their refusal to serve chips, because 'Scottish people eat too many chips'. Hmm, ok - but then they serve Hasselback potatoes: roasted potatoes covered in cheese. I'm not entirely convinced that's a step up nutritionally - but they taste good, so I'm happy.",
