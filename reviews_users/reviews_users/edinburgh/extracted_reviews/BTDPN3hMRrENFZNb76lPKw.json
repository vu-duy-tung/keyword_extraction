    "text": "The Slug and Lettuce in the Omni centre is a decent enough pub for one that belongs to a chain. The decor is pretty standard for this type of pub, with large squishy sofas and comfy seats to encourage you to stay longer. As with all chain pubs, it's slightly lacking in atmosphere and the bar staff aren't terribly friendly, but no worse than i expected.   The drinks are a bit more expensive than other places in the Omni Centre, but watch out for their promotions as there is always something on special offer. The food is over priced and really of a pretty poor standard. There are so many other places to eat in the centre that taste nicer and are much better value, so i generally avoid eating here.",

Their policy is that a party with children (aka a \"family\") MUST have meals off the menu and \"snacks don't count\". That makes no sense whatsoever, as basically they're letting me know my business is not important to them, but it was hard to get further information as the server didn't seem to understand the policy either, and if she did she certainly couldn't explain it to us.   Lest anyone think we were running amok it was two adults a 15 and 7yo and literally minutes after we sat down and said we were just having drinks we were asked to \"please leave\". This was quite upsetting, embarrassing and confusing  Anyway, I can't swear to it but I'm pretty sure that's illegal as there was a group of for adults just having drinks. I don't think a restaurant can discriminate based on age/ family status.  So if you're a family they don't want your business and if you're not a family do you really want to support a business that discriminates?",

It looks more charming and relaxed than the other places, and the food isn't horrible. With the look and feel of the place, I kind of expected a classier menu, but it is just pub food! Don't be fooled :) The 2 for 1 cocktail deal is really the reason to go here with a group of girls, not the atmosphere or the food. The cocktails are delivered quick, they're cheap and they're well tasty :)",

The last time I was here it was a bit awkward when I walked in with my friends. There was no hostess to greet us and we just stood there waiting to be seated while several servers walked past us, stared at us, and proceeded to ignore us. Finally one attentive waiter asked us if we were waiting to be seated and we said yes. Why else would we be standing there looking expectant? The best thing about this place is the great daily deals. 50% off food on Mondays, 2-4-1 curries on Tuesdays! You can't beat that.   Also, as a vegan I was happy to see that they have one completely vegan (and healthy!) meal on the menu, the sweet potato salad. It was actually quite good, I'd order it again. Before I was vegan (was vegetarian) I had the veg curry (has dairy in it) which was just okay, obviously not as good as a curry from a proper Indian eatery.",

The chips let it down a lot. I wasn't impressed by anything they brought out but I was filled with chicken so fairly satisfied. It was a bit pricey given the quality though.Think Wetherspoons-esque menu but a burger is a tenner.   Cocktails are half price at the weekends. There's a decent selection but honestly Ms. Lightweight over here could barely feel them. They were tasty in that 'Sugar is tasty' way.   The restaurant and the bar are separated, which I approve of and the tables and chairs were well spaced out. We didn't have anyone earwigging and it was easy to ignore those around us. The whole place has a 'modern' look to it, which is where I get my airport impression. You can tell they've gone for simple and reasonably minimalist but didn't want to go too far. The crowd was mainly tourists it seems, with a few locals, particularly large groups of wine drinking middle aged women. There was a few lads dotted around who I imagine would be 'suits' Monday-Friday. They clearly get a lot of the out-to-the-cinema trade too.  The staff were lovely. They were clearly run off their feet but they were on the ball and friendly whenever they came over or we called them while they were in the middle of something. There was even some banter.  Overall it was a decent meal in a decent place but if I had a choice I'd head somewhere with more character.",

    "text": "many years ago i crossed the thershold of Slug and Lettuce for a post movie drink on a sort of date/sort of not a date evening.  the venue was fine, my gin and tonic was fine but besides that i can't really remember much else.  however i was pleasantly surprised when i crossed the threshold again this past friday for pre movie dinner and drinks with some friends.  the place itself has had a massive refurb (i think quite recently...) so it's now all bring colours and fancy light fixtures.  the refurb has really made it into a nice light space which if i recall correctly is certainly an improvement from itself previous look.  now coming to a chain restaurant i don't set my expectations high.  food is usually standard and very often not made entirely on the premises.  so with this in mind we looked over the food menu and decide to share the poppy seed crown with warm manchego fondue and veggie crudites and a  chicken flatbread tostada between three of us.  this was accompained by a few cocktails as their whole cocktail menu is half price on friday!  normally i probably wouldn't have bothered as their cocktails are fairly pricey- nothing under the 8 mark on the menu, but half priced meant i could basically get two for the price of one.  food arrived and we were pleasantly surprised by how tasty it was.  the manchego fondue was quite nice although came in a rather small pot for a sharing dish.  the poppy seed crown was warm and although possibly just heated up in the oven seemed it could also have been fresh baked.  the flatbread tostada was more like a wrap that had been topped with some chicken and cheese/artichoke spread then slightly warmed.  it was ok, fairly tasty but not by any means amazing.  since all this sharing meant small portions we decided to have dessert as well and i ordered the chocolate and caramel bar.  this actually turned out to be incredibly good with a nice balance of rich chocolate and salted caramel toffee sauce in the middle.  it was also a good portion size that would make it ideal for sharing.  after finishing off our second cocktail we paid our bill and were on our way.  while two courses and two cocktails only came to 20 i'm not sure how value this was for money.  the cocktails were just ok with my passionfruit bellini tasty mostly of sugary passionfruit syrup and less of the actual prosecco.  the amaretto sour i had was nice but again not very strong on the alcohol front.  so overall for a chain restaurant this place is decent, it has good menu options and half priced cocktails on a friday.  it's definitely a step up from the nearby wetherspoons and i'd happy go here for a quick cheap eat before a movie again.",

I had a numb bum, tired eyes and a rumbly tummy so we decided something quick and easy will do. My friend was desperate for a Sunday Roast so this place fitted the bill.  Or so we thought, after being shown to a table and deciding on what we wanted we were told there was no Sunday Roast left...... I saw his eyes sink a little. Gutted. On a side note, please either decide if you are going to have table service or order at the bar, I find the mix of the two really rather bizzare.  So, I ordered a Mojito as cocktails are half price at the weekends!? Meh, I would not have it again if I were to return. It was a little lacklustre. I then had a butternut squash, spinach and goats cheese lasagne - sounds yum, tasted yum. Up until an hour or so later, I did not feel well and having eaten nothing else I can't see what else could have made me feel so queasy. Rather disappointing really, wish I had gone somewhere a little more exciting.",

    "text": "Distinctly tepid soup, an eclectic car-crash menu, and friendly but slow service. This is not the recipe for a happy lunchtime.  Overall, we said: \"the Slug & Lettuce wasn't great. They absolutely, categorically need to chop their menu at least in half, if not further than that. They have eight different burger options, sitting next to a similar number of curry options, sitting next to a broad range of pasta options, and from what I could see, none of it looked too appetizing. They need to focus on a much smaller number of dishes, and try to inject some quality. For now, I couldn't recommend the place.\"",

    "text": "Half priced food on mondays.  YES!   We had to wait 45 minutes to order food because the kitchen was so overloaded with orders - but the drinks we ordered in the meantime were tasty and decently priced.  I had chicken curry with rice and my husband had the steak.  Both were really delicious and you just can't beat the price.  All the entrees are fairly priced to begin with, so 50% off means they're super cheap.  All the sandwiches and burgers looked really good too and the portions were big.    Service was great.  Our server was getting slammed due to the 50% off food special, but she managed to come around a few times and apoligized for the wait.  The bar area has a great atmosphere too which made the wait managable.  My recommendation would be to come after 7PM, as it died down substantially after that.  Tuesdays they have 2-for-1 indian entrees which is a great deal too.  I would definitely go back if I lived in the area!",

    "text": "The Slug and Lettuce may not be exciting or original but it is a reliable go-to if you are after a few drinks or bit of food before the cinema or theatre.  There's loads of space and a section at the front with really comfy leather and seats and couches if you've had a long day and want to relax.   There's quite a varied menu and everything I've ever had has always been tasty and good value for money - particuarly love the risotto and tostadas (somewhere between a fajita and a pizza) and the puddings are generous and yummy aswell. They also do an offer on Monday's where all food has 50% off which is a great bargain.  The cocktails are really basic, don't expect anything authentic or memorable but at least the service is good so you'll get it quickly!",

It's dirty, the carpet always has food mushed into it, the tables are never cleaned properly, the wine is warm (!!), the food is horrible re-heated crap, the prices are extortionate and the staff are moody.  I;ve been here several times and come to the same conclusion. I thought it was ok because it was beside the cinema etc etc - don't make the same mistake I did!!",

    "text": "This bar is absolutely fine to pop into for a drink. But I'd never eat in there again. We'd stopped in for lunch one day and I'd ordered a pasta with roasted peppers and a tomato sauce. Only it came with virtually no peppers at all (I was lucky if I had two slivers) and the sauce? What sauce?   I don't agree with paying around 8 for a bowl of bland pasta with virtually no vegetables or sauce. Hell, for that price, I could have got myself a decent two course lunch elsewhere.   Needless to say, it didn't do much for my hangover, and I couldn't bring myself to finish it either. My mate wasn't exactly fussed on hers either - so that too got left.   Bland, microwaved pre-cooked food. No value for money at all, and I just can't recommend it. Stick with the drinks. You know where you stand with those!",

    "text": "I was very let down by this place, as i have been to various other establishments owned by the same company and the food and service was far superior! I had ordered a chicken and pasta dish, and my friend had ordered a pasta dish which was supposed to have roasted vegetables with it. Instead my chicken dish came with the roasted vegetables and my friends dish came with a miniscule amount of pasta sauce! The service was not great either, oh, and my chicken was dry! I did have soup for a starter though, and i must admit, it was nice. Thank goodness i did have that as i'd been leaving the place as hungry as i was when i walked in otherwise! I dont think i'll be back!   It is a nicely decorated place, and i have been in for a quick drink before heading to the cinema, but food wise, i'll give it a miss in future!",
