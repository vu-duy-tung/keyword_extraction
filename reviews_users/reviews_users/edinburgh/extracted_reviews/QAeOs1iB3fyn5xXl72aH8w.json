    "text": "Tourista's observation:  Solid French Brasserie food in Edinburgh!  If you are staying in New Town, probably using AirBnB, Cote Brasserie is a very good option for Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner. Easy to get into without reservations!!!  Great location easy to get to by walking or taxi/uber.  Cute ambiance(<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cote-brasserie-edinburgh-edinburgh?select=9Aqlsk0mmOemoOKwMoVPkw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cote...</a>) with a very french bistro feel (thus the name).  We ate breakfast here once and had dinner as well.  Service is very good: polite and efficient  Breakfast options of Scottish Salmon and eggs (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cote-brasserie-edinburgh-edinburgh?select=lBIj-Hh-CIHbQXt5rvw7tw&userid=kroQYWSj-BhIEXT4VwLRHA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cote...</a>)  Full  breakfast (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cote-brasserie-edinburgh-edinburgh?select=NrEvudWnKytEFndW4L0wZg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cote...</a>)   Vegetarian breakfast (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cote-brasserie-edinburgh-edinburgh?select=23WfMxSqoV0-h5UHTrxfIQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cote...</a>)  All of these breakfast options were fantastic and moderately priced.   Dinners are just as good:  Appetizers of Asparagus (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cote-brasserie-edinburgh-edinburgh?select=28hU-ctma0-4vorqHgbJ3A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cote...</a>),  Baked goat cheese (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cote-brasserie-edinburgh-edinburgh?select=X5QGd4KylKIA1jjYOhzjFA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cote...</a>),  Steak tartar..talk about classic bistro food! (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cote-brasserie-edinburgh-edinburgh?select=HGeTXvSGR1BVjIf_LVJQPw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cote...</a>),  And Chicken Liver parfait with toast points (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cote-brasserie-edinburgh-edinburgh?select=o30PoUUz7Dw0tzQYih39ew\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cote...</a>)...  All were exceptionally well crafted, well plated and simply delicious   Entrees were nonetheless exceptional:  Fish Parmentier was something I had never heard of before...yes sure the ubiquitous Hachis Parmentier. However it was really great. (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cote-brasserie-edinburgh-edinburgh?select=r0vWVDX1eJzjR6I5R53ZtQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cote...</a>)  I opted for a french version of fish and chips and was not let down (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cote-brasserie-edinburgh-edinburgh?select=vtxfEuy6wClGScThMD6fTw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cote...</a>)  Even a simple chicken dish turned out to be a wonderful surprise of super fresh and very unique ingredients (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cote-brasserie-edinburgh-edinburgh?select=hsEKJeaIPDhMspx7yM01jg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cote...</a>)  Simple but good wine list offering nice french wines (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cote-brasserie-edinburgh-edinburgh?select=gO6fOLKvib29IhdAcrj3nQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cote...</a>)  If I were back in Edinburgh I would dine here again no exception!!!",

I've been to many with fancy schmancy ingredients and etc but the service and food you get at Cote for 10 freakin pounds BLOWS me away.   also I had no clue till later it was a chain but I dont get that feel at all!  you can get a few different breakfasts include a fill e flush breakfast PLUS hot drink, a juice, and filtered water all for 10. however what blows me away is the level of service at the various locations ive been to. its very applicated but approachable. j truly feel the experience and food allow it to charge 1.5x more in my opinion. you may think it's questionable food for that price but it's actually legit. they put chives in the eggs and even the butter is SOFT not frozen.   also I get a croissant now and they warm it up which is like crack. it's so good by itself.   i love this place and could only imagine a place like the four seasons London could beat but overall value I doubt it can be beat.

You can guess from this review that Cote was one of them.    I am completely genuine when I say it is one of the best meals I have had.  We came two nights in a row.    Me: French onion soup. -perfect ; salmon - absolutely perfect (try cooking salmon and avoiding it being completely dry); order of french fries shared with husband - perfect  Husband: French onion soup; yesterday - linguini with seafood - perfect consistency ; today - prime rib no bone (perfect).  His birthday, so we got creme brule - perfect.  Need I say more?  I am not sure we can stay away tomorrow - it is that good.  Oh, by the way, the service is impeccable.  I am not sure I would expect this if I came at the highest season, August.  Go here, you ill not regret it.",

It was not yet busy, which worked for us since we had no reservations.  We were greeted promptly and taken to a table towards the rear of the restaurant.   The list of wines revealed nothing that we were familiar with, so our waiter suggested a bottle of Viognier that we took. It was a good wine for us...not too dry. We also ordered bread & butter. The bread was a warm, soft sourdough that was excellent.   My wife ordered the chicken with garlic butter and a side of creamed spinach. I had some of the chicken and found it to be quite tasty even without the garlic butter, which added a very good complimentary taste. The creamed spinach was quite different with a bit of Pernod added (if I remember correctly).  It was very unique.   I had the fish parmentier. It was very good, although the portion seemed to be on the small side. The dish had been baked in the oven to finish it giving the potatoes a nice golden color that was appealing.   We had the crepe grand marnier for dessert. It was very good.  Our waiter lit the grand marnier when he served it, which was a neat presentation.   Overall, the service was good.  Our waiter was attentive without being overbearing, which enabled us to have some good long conversations. The ambiance was welcoming...soft music in the background, and not too loud. When we left the restaurant, it was very crowded and much louder, but not to the point where we had to shout to hear each other.",
