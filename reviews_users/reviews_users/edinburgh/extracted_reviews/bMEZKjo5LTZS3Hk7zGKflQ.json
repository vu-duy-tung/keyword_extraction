    "text": "This is the first time I've been to Nando's and I was really impressed with the food.   It's more a fast food style of service, so you get a table and then order your food and drink at the bar. The food is then brought to your table.   I had a half chicken with sweet potato mash and it was really good. I had the hot spice and it certainly lived up to the name!! It wasn't a huge chicken and I could quite easily have eaten more. My husband had a plain chicken burger which he said was ok. The olives were good and one of my friends had the cous cous salad which looked pretty good too.   It was pretty busy and noisy (it was a Friday night so to be expected!) but teh service was still quick, although queueing to order took ages.   As it's in fountain park theres plenty of parking, and if you get your ticket validated by the restaurant the parking is free.   There is also a take away service",

The staff suggesting it's my fault.   Spoiled the night. Customer not coming back. EVER.   But of course I ate there before this happens, food is good quality and very nice ambiance. Only service is poor, but it still counts, though.   Sorry but I will never suggest Nandos in Edinburgh ever again to my friends and to our 5-STAR HOTEL GUESTS. Sorry!",

This place does flame grilled chicken and its always lovely and tender and delicious. The peri peri chips are quite nice and the cole slaw is different, in a good way!   The only thing I am not really into is the sauces. I have tried all of them and don't really care for them but to be honest you can get the chicken plain and its still super tasty which is a True testament to how nice the grilled chicken is. This particular location is quite popular but almost always has seating. Though, the booths fill up quickly.  Also a big thumbs up for the customer service. I only have good things to say about the people who have served me there. Very nice and helpful.",

I like the portobello mushroom wrap with hallumi cheese & pineapple. The sweet potato mash is great too.   The staff are nice although their staff turnover seems pretty fast as always new faces when I go in.   It is in the fountain park complex, so handy pre cinema for a quick tea.   I would ideally like to see a completely separate area for preparing & cooking veggie options rather than different sides of the grill, this can freak me out if things get too close and there is a meat cross contamination incident!

I feel weird to say it, but Nando's trumped a large majority of restaurants that profess to have greater quality menus out there, and could learn a thing or two from it i.e. a variety of options, and interesting ones to boot.",

They introduced beef, and chicken thighs.   The service is friendly, helpful and efficient. The tables are clean (not sticky as I originally noticed in my previous review).  I like the refillable icewater and bottemless soft drinks.  Their sauces include new varieties Garlic, Lemon, Wild Herb, which are tasty and hot.   Their fries however have taken a battering (.. see what I did here) - they were a little limp and soft, with minumum of peri peri salt.   Still a great contender in the Edinburgh 'Wings' quest - If there was one. (perhaps I should start one..)",

I do not however think that the restaurant is particularly good value for money - 12 for an ordinary sized wrap with two modest servings of rice/veg is steep. The pricing structure across the board is also rather bizarre. Where else charges 3.01 for a beer (never mind that one of them is Super Bock, which Oddbins practically give away, not that it's a bad beer in any way)? Possibly this is due to the recent vat change but it strikes me they could either have absorbed that or re-priced in a more sensible manner rather than littering the menu with pence amounts of 13, 26, 64 etc. On this visit they also ran out of knives (and those on the go looked rather less than totally clean although that could have just been dishwasher smears) and they could do with a larger soft drink dispenser as on busy nights it appears to run out of content on a regular basis due to the free refills available.   For 2nd tier fast food I would choose the La Tasca or TGI Fridays chains above Nando's.",

    "text": "edinburgh used to be a sad city with exactly zero nandos in its city limits.  and then one opened....and then a second, and finally a third.  and then my heart was happy because nando's is one of those places that is just good.  and it was perfect for a pre-rugby lunch when our prefered choice of venue told us they had no tables.  nando's however, was still fairly empty as it had just gone noon and most rugby going fans were in a pub with a pint.  we however were being swifty shown to a table with menus and the promise of food very soon.  i decided quickly because despite nando's being known for its grilled chicken, i always get the grilled portabello mushroom and haluomi pita.  it's delicious and haluomi cheese is just amazinggggggggggg.  i ordered this with a side of fries and macho peas.  the boyfriend went for a double chicken wrap with corn on the cob and some fries.  we also ordered the hummus with peri peri drizzle to share.  i know so much food, but i was suffering some bad hangover blues and needed some nando's loving!!  orders taken quickly and we were back at our table with drinks and followed by the hummus shortly.  the peri peri drizzle came in an adorable little bottle so you could add as much or as little as you wanted.  and loads of pitta bread for dipping yummmmmmmm!!  we had a bit of a wait for our food, but i think that that was the hangover hunger monster being inpatient so it wasn't actually that long.  my pita was awesome with a huge portabello mushroom and lots of grilled haluomi cheese!!! the chips were ok (not quite as crisp as i like) but the peas were super tasty with just a tiny kick of chilli.  the empty plate across from me clearly signifed that my boyfriend enjoyed his wrap as well.  so nando's gets a hearty four stars from me.  it's consistent, the food is of good quality, it has the option to go healthy if you wanted, and they have grilled haluomi cheese.  this is a chain i will happily go to when in need of a satisfying and quick dinner.",

    "text": "Even thinking about Nando's makes me a little bit hungry for some chicken.  If I want to eat out at Fountain Park, I will automatically first think of Nando's.  Trouble is, quite often everyone else has the same idea.  This won't stop me coming back here though.  I'd never even heard of Nando's before I came to Edinburgh.  I had no idea of what I was missing, and it was only when I moved into Bruntsfield a couple of years back that I realised the error of my ways.  The idea of Nando's is simple.  You can get chicken done to differing levels of spicyness,  These can then be had with a variety of side dishes, or as a burger, wrap, pitta, or other things.  There are, of course, provisions made for any vegetarians who may come along.  The kitchen at Nando's feels much like a part of the restaurant.  You can see the grills at work as you order your food, and watch the magic unfold.  Nando's feels a bit like a fast food place, in that you place your order at the counter, and collect your own cutlery and sauces.  On the sauces front, try the extra extra hot sauce (in the black bottle).  The consensus amongst my friends is that it is not the hottest one they offer.  What do you think?  I have never been disappointed with the food I have got from Nando's.  It is often busy and so, the food can sometimes take a while to arrive, but you'll forget about that once you start eating.  If you have never eaten at Nando's, I have no idea why.  You are missing one of Edinburgh's great culinary experiences.!",

As Mark says, this is the first option people opt for when they go to Fountain Park, and there is a very good reason for this, because the food is so tasty! I can be a bit of a pig when I go here, my usual choice I go for is the 1/2 chicken, bathed in several layers of chicken peri perisauce, with this I usually order a side of chips and a corn on the cob. You can get garlic bread as a side, but I would suggest against this, you only get a couple of slices, and it really doesn't provide you with good value for money. This meal comes to around 9, but considering a meal at Burger King costs around 6, the few extra quid, really is worth it and puts them a cut above such fast food joints.",

My partner and I have been going to the Fountainpark branch for years as a pre-cinema pig-out and have sampled pretty much everything on the menu (yes, we like our chicken). During that time we have only had one less than great experience with the food (cold mashed potato, but when we sent it back we got it for free) which isn't bad considering the number of times we have eaten there. The menu is varied and although chicken features heavily there are veggie options and a steak option for proper carnivores. The veggie beanie burger is actually delicious. Also delicious are the salads, proper big portions and taste very fresh. The chicken is always very tender and not at all dry and of course you can see the kitchen/grill area so you know they prepare to order.   The staff here are super friendly and always smiling, even though it is sometimes really busy and they look like they are doing 100 jobs at once. It's also very clean and that includes the toilets. It does get very busy here and you can't reserve tables (unless you're in a large group I think) so sometimes there is a 20 minute+ wait for a table but it's worth it.  Nandos is a chain and if you go there expecting silver service and haute cuisine you won't find it. But what you will find is darn good chicken cooked to perfection for a very reasonable price.",

The Fountain park branch is only a few minutes walk from my flat so made it an easy choice for Sunday dinner when feeling too lazy to cook. The place was big enough that we didn't have to queue to get a table but not so cavernous that it ruins any atmosphere.   Being a bit of a chicken wing fan I went straight for the portion of 10 with a side of chips. I am Scottish after all. My partner has a quarter chicken with sides of rice and coleslaw. The staff member at the counter asked if we'd visited Nando's before and told us we were very brave opting for the hot sauce as first time visitors. We're fans of spicy food though and would probably have rated this more medium than hot. Just a pleasant amount of heat with plenty of flavour.   If there's not enough heat in the marinade for you they prvide bottles of sauce of each heat level to take to your table so you can spice it up 'til your hearts content.   The wings were perfectly cooked with the meat just falling off the bone. Chips are chips and I can't think of anything exciting to say about them.   With top-ups of your soft drink also included and a takeaway service available I'll be more than happy to become a regular at Nando's",
