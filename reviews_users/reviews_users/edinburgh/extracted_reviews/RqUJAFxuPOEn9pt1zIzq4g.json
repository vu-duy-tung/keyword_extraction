    "text": "How does this place not have more reviews?! We were staying a the hotel down the block from Chop House and decided to have it as our first dinner in Edinburgh as we woke up from our afternoon naps. This. Place. Is. Bomb.  We were seated at the bar since we did not have a reservation. The bartender was very attentive and patient with our questions on the menu. 1. Scallop & pig cheek starter - So the pig cheek looks like bacon when it comes but can you imagine something more delicious than bacon? It's pig cheek. You have to get it. 2. Bone-in rib - We got the smallest portion since it was just 2 girls but it was a good size where we can barely finish it by stuffing ourselves. We both wished it was done a bit more rare (the hostess did recommend it at medium). Otherwise great flavor and texture. 3. Beef dripping mushrooms - A bit too salty but goes well with the steak 4. Oysters - We couldn't help but ordered 2 local oysters at the end of our meal even though they were a bit expensive at 2.5 gbp per. They were creamy, flavorful, meaty, delicious and fresh. If I were any richer (or more hungry), I would've ordered a dozen for myself. They make their own mignonette in-house from scratch!!!  The bill was definitely smaller than I expected since, in my opinion, we kinda went all out. Great service. Great food. Great vibe. Would recommend in a heartbeat to anyone.",

They dry age in house and have a great selection of cuts for any taste.  They also have great sides and a good bar selection.  The portions are big and one could consider sharing the sides.  The mac and cheese is excellent!    The service was excellent and you'll enjoy the decor being that the restaurant was made under a road arch.  Very creative.",

    "text": "Must be a brand new restaurant in this part of Edinburgh. (Uber couldn't find it. Gps wanted to take us to London. The place is next door to Vino so I'll be the first to write a review.) The place is modern and refreshing to see how Edinburgh is also taking up the baton of local crafting of beers and unique, individual creative infused menus.  Chophouse is fantastic in being a steakhouse. Prices are reasonable - portions are adequate. My monkfish cheek fish and chips (scampi) were delicious and I'm still in tranced in the taste. I'm uploading a pic.  Ribeye is 350 grams for about 22. Cooked perfect. No pic. My buddy downed it in his second bite. Kind of selfish but he has a huge smile.  Sides were tasty and high quality. Mushrooms, bacon cheese cauliflower. Coleslaw.  Burger is one of the best we have had and we are from cattle communities. We know are meats.  Mushrooms with goat cheese was a good dish for our vegetarian friend. He licked the plate.  Beers - butcher shop brewing  80 shilling ale. It's a cream ale. Looks like a Guinness top but blonder taste and smooth body. Head holds the whole way down. Reminds me of a good bj. Definitely just as satisfying. Multiple of those please. Keep them coming. .  Service friendly. Overall happy and very glad we took a chance on this place.",

    "text": "I had a nice meal here last weekend but I admit to being torn between three and four stars.   The food was quite good, though in the case of the starters and sides I'd say they were quite pricey for quantity (2.50 for a single tempura prawn, for example) and over-salted.   We each had a cocktail which were delicious and probably the creative highlight of the evening.   Two starters, two tempura prawns, two mains, two cocktails, one glass of wine and one dessert - 100. It was never going to be a cheap night out but I do find that on the steep side.   I was a bit disappointed about being told halfway through the meal that we only had the table for two hours. As we neared our two hour limit, we were reminded again and invited to shift to the bar. I could have understood enforcing this rule if there was actually someone waiting for our table, but there wasn't. We both would have liked an after dinner drink but decided against sitting at the bar to do so.   All in all not a bad experience but not necessarily somewhere I would rush back to, but for the drinks. Definitely high marks on the drinks.",
