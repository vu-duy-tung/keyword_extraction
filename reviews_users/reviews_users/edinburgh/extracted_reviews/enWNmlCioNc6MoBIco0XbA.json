The food is amazing and I posting this too close to lunch time and I am too far away to be thinking about how good there sandwiches are.  I always opt for the soup and a goats cheese/peppers bagette. The bagettes are rustic and the cheese peppers are a perfect combo to this.My friend always grabs a Croque Madame, whcih here is bechamel and cheese done over a grill. She is never a big eater so I always fall air to half... yep she is the perfect lunch companion! The coffee is the main reason I keep coming back large cups of americano with swaths of \"la crema\". They really know there food and drinks here. The couple that own the place are the nicest people you could meet. Thumbs up from me.",

    "text": "We were out on one of those warm summery days and found ourselves searching for a wee sandwich shop in the area. We had never heard of this place and decided to take a chance. The decor was brilliant! You feel like you are in a real french cafe!  You could tell that they took their food seriously as well as they had very rare treats such as a special pate, and cheeses that you rarely see around. I am not very familiar with French food but wanted to try the ever so famous Croque Monsieur. Apparently these bad boys can go for 20 euros at the hotels in Paris!! Here however they are much more reasonably priced.   Basically its an open faced sandwich (baguette) with bechamel and emmental cheese. Its grilled and the baguette gets a bit crunchy (Croque Monsieur means Mister crunchy in France), and the cheese toasted and even a bit burnt, which I love cause its crunchy on top yet bubbly and beautiful underneath. I asked that he put a bit of dijon and pepper on it which gave it a bit of kick. LOVED IT!   They also have fresh squeezed orange juice which I have come to understand is quite difficult to come across in these northerly parts! I can't even tell you how many times I have asked the waiter if the orange juice was freshly squeezed and for them to tell me yes, yet  when I receive the juice it is clearly from the carton and not even tropicana quality! ugh. yes, this is a pet peeve of mine, but is it so hard to understand the concept of freshly squeezed juice???? Anyways, they do have it here and I love that.   The price is reasonable and the place is quaint and delicious. They also offer student discounts (10% off).",

    "text": "Made in France is far more than your average deli. The owners have sourced everything in the shop themselves from independent French suppliers to give the customers a far more authentic French experience. Real Toulouse sausages and Raclette cheese hang from the shelves between bottles of wine and vinegar. For me though one of the nicest things I discovered were the tiny pots of apple puree that you get in every French supermarket but are impossible to find over here. Basically it's baby food, mushed up apples in a squeezy pot, but wow it just tastes so good!   It was only on my second or third visit here that I also discovered that Made in France hire out Fondue and Raclette sets too. Having never had the urge to hold a fondue party (I lie, I always have the urge but I fear it would be a habit I couldn't quit) I'm yet to try one of these sets out myself but I bet it would be a lot of fun. The shop prepares the cheese for you so all you have to do is melt it and dip stuff in. Cheesy deliciousness!",

    "text": "This is a gorgeous little deli, tucked away on Lochrin Place, serving the most delicious and incredibly strong coffee with a selection of tarts, cakes and pastries to go. It's filled with pretty unmatched polka dot and floral tablecloths, which adds to its quirky charm.  I visited today and treated myself to a cafe au lait and a brioche to take away, which came to a very reasonable 2.25. Incredibly strong and incredibly delicious coffee, to the very last drop. What I loved most about this place is the customer service, displayed as the staff chatted away to a lovely lady, who was dressed up with full hair and makeup, for a wee afternoon to herself filled with coffee and cake, while the staff conversed with her like an old friend. A charming and delicious deli.",

    "text": "With the recent sad closure of Jacques, Made In France is holding out the French fort in Tollcross.   They have a lovely selection of French produce on sale and walking in feels like arriving in a little deli in the south of France.   The selection of food at lunchtime is excellent - as is the quality. I've treated myself to a good few smoked chicken sandwiches and last time I went for a sit-down quiche and salad, which was absolutely delicious.   All in all, thoroughly recommended!",

    "text": "Made in France is a typically French deli/cafe which stands out from the crowd of sandwich shops and cafes in the Tollcross/Lothian Road area. They sell lots of authentic French products such as sauces, jams and biscuits. They will even hire out fondue sets for the weekend which I think is a great idea. The freshly prepared baguettes and meals (eg quiche, crepes, soup) are lovely with great quality fillings. I recommend the croque monsieur - just like you get in France and perfect comfort food for a winter lunch. The takeaway prices are slightly higher than other delis in the area but it's worth paying a premium for the tasty baguettes and hot meals",
