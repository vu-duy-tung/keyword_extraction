They had a lot of cakes & pastries that made the place look like a lovely little bakery.   My server was really sweet, but I forgot her name.",

Egg, sausage, toast, scone, hash brown, mushrooms and baked-beans all perfectly cooked and delicious. The cafe Americanos was perfect too. Great service and a good price. The place was full and everyone seemed to be well served and happy. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",

Where else would your waitress be willing to do that? Very friendly personality and she didn't try to snow you with BS like many servers try to do to jack up the bill. Very honest and forthcoming when asked her opinion. She was caring enough to come back and ask our opinion on the different whiskeys we ordered. She was genuinely caring. We appreciate that. Thanks. You should give this place a try. It was really satisfying.",

The two people at the front kept looking at me knowing I was annoyed but never asked if I was doing okay or if I wanted anything else. It wasn't until I asked for a refund that they apologized and offered another coffee lol, all I wanted was some pancakes that take about 5 minutes to make. So disorganized, there are a lot of better cafe's around this area.",

I've stopped in for a quick coffee while I'm walking around like a tourist and I've also stopped in for several hours to eat a meal and use the wifi.  Indeed, what brought me in in the first place is the great free wifi signal, but the reason I come back is the people and the food.  The owners and the staff are very friendly and engaging and will treat you like family if you engage them.  A lot of locals eat here which a great sign.  The prices are about what you'd expect for a cafe in a tourist area but the serving sizes are huge!  They advertise 3-egg omelets but I swear there are 5 eggs in there.  I particularly like the lamb koftas.  Great cafe!",

    "text": "As Stephanie said, you're not expecting a wee cafe like this to wow you with its performance. It's the kind of place you duck in to grab a roll and then go. So I was very pleasantly surprised with the service I received in Cafe Keno today!  Serving up panini's, baguettes and some bigger dishes, Cafe Keno is quite spacious when all the doors are open. Inside it's got a nice, bright colour scheme that makes it look zesty and fresh. It's very clean and there is enough room to have a look at the full cake stand without feeling like you're getting in anyone's way!  Opting to come in here instead of spending 7 quid for a panini somewhere else on the Royal Mile, I wasn't disappointed. I was quite surprised to receive table service here, since I just expected to wait for my food to be heated. The staff were very attentive and checked to see if I was enjoying my panini. The pot of tea was massive and I got at least 3 full pours out of it - it's the little things, y'know!  I liked the Greek options on the menu and the food was fresh. But what did it for me was the service. The staff couldn't have been nicer, and that plays a huge part in how you perceive a business. Absolutely lovely, I would definitely recommend going here over some other places on the Royal Mile (which may be more inclined to rip you off).",

    "text": "Whilst I don't seem to have had quite the same terrible experience as Gavin, Cafe Keno didn't exactly bowl me over with awesomeness.  Cafe Keno is a fairly standard affair. It offers decent coffee and tea, and substandard British cafe food. The problem basically is that at the heart of Edinburgh, on the High Street, why not go elsewhere? There are a million other very high standard cafe and restaurants nearby. Cafe Keno just doesn't really stand out. Perhaps it has room for improvement though, it certainly isn't a bad place.  In its favour there is usually plenty of sitting space outside which is nice on a summers day to watch the busy tourists go by, especially as they serve ice cream to go with it.",

And took them forever. It was pretty busy when we were there so I understand maybe they aren't used to it, but I asked for water twice and I never got it. Service was so slow, that my friend had to leave before I get a box for the food. Maybe if you are there during off season, you may have a better experience? I don't know... I would definitely go back there if I'm getting just tea or coffee though.",

'Fine' isn't exactly a glowing review but I think maybe people forget that this cafe isn't claiming to be anything other than a pit stop for a bacon roll and a cup of Nescafe, and that's exactly what this cafe offers you.  How it makes enough money to stay open I don't know, because there are so many other, superior cafes around the same area, but if you need a quick bottle of Coke or a wee snack to munch whilst exploring the Royal Mile then you can't go wrong with this place really.   I have to agree with Gavin though. The pictures of the food don't do this place any favours.",

The food is incredibly shite. It's as simple as that.",
