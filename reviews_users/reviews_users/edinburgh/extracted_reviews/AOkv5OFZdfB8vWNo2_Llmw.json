It had nothing to do with the McDonald's staff, but the customers that were next to us. I'm so glad that an employee named Ross at this location stepped up and asked whether or not we were ok during this altercation. He was concerned over our well being because we were clearly trying to eat in peace without any altercations,but the two guys next to us were clearly harassing us. Thank you Ross for checking in. I hope that other employees are as observant as he was, because this is a serious issues internationally and could be made a bigger issue.",

Anyway the food was warm not hot, we had to stand and eat our food as the priority seating for parents with children or old people was full (mostly young teenagers and couples)   wont ever go again, Burger King is a lot better",

    "text": "Ah McDonalds, you old dog (which is probably what you put in your burgers), we had some good times eh? To think I actually used to get excited about a McDonalds all those years ago.  This is actually a branch of McDonalds I used to still visit a few years ago when my family visited Edinburgh. Other than the decor, not much has changed.  This is possibly Edinburgh's \"premier\" McDonalds. Situated on Princes St, it boasts two large floors. Apart from \"water saving toilets\" (ironic for a company known for its destructive environment policy) and free wi-fi there isn't anything special about this McDonalds. It's dressed in that new McDonalds style, with natural organic colours, combined with tidy leather, to give an impression of both health and sophistication (the latter a la Starbucks). This hip new feel seems to be the result of the heavy criticism the corporation received at the beginning of the 2000s on health and ethical grounds, and its increasing reputation by the middle classes as somewhere they wouldn't want to be seen dead in, which was unfortunately one of the potential side effects of eating there too much. All this culminated in the well known documentary \"Super Size Me\" which documents a McDonalds lifestyles drastic effects on the film maker's physical and psychological well-being, and discovers the company's corporate influence, including its encouragement of poor nutrition for its own profit.  Like all McDonalds, come to the Princes St branch knowing what you're going to get. If you want cheap, convenient slop, flavoured with salt and sugar to hook your primeval taste buds, then so be it. But don't expect a nutritional meal, or fine cuisine. After all this is the place where a Cesar salad contains more fat than a burger.  I looked into this branch because, I'll admit, I was curious. But I really have no desire to eat here. I last ate a McDonalds when I was stuck overnight in a German train station and there was literally nothing else to eat. But with knowledge of McDonald's track record of opposing unions; their contribution to the industry which causes more carbon emissions than the entire transport industry (as the world's largest user of intensively farmed beef); and their repeated threat of legal action against critics, means I am a more than just put off by their soggy chips.  I also find it unfortunate that our capital city's main shopping street, is now totally overpopulated by chain stores, with an ever dwindling number of local, traditional and independent shops that can not possibly compete.",

During the busy periods you might wait for your food quite a bit as the service isnt the fastest. The staff working there is rather friendly. The food isnt always to highest quality.",
