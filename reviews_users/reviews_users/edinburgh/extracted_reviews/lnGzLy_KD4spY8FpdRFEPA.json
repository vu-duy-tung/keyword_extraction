The ingredients are fresh and high quality and contrary to what I read in some reviews, I think the food is quite flavorful (just not spicy).",

    "text": "It's no Chipotle, but it will do in a pinch if you need a burrito. Be warned, not nearly as much flavor as in a Chipotle (or really any American restaurant's) burrito.   I've come here a few times. The steak can be tough so I tend to avoid it and go for the chicken. I'm also not a big fan of the beans so I stick with the veg.",

    "text": "A cool burrito place, mostly good for takeaway.  - Their small burrito is for 5.50 and regular is for 6.50.  - Not the cheapest but you can get a 20% student discount. - The burritos are delicious. You have a choice of spicy and normal beans, many meat fillings but I got the vegetarian peppers and mushrooms. - The salsa is the shit, the 4 options of salsa go from chopped tomatoes to extra-hot. - Well-wrapped good burritos for a full mean or even two!",
