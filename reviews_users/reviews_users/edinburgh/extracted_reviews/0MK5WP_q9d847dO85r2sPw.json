    "text": "This was the most solid breakfast we found in Edinburgh  On a quite busy street, this small unassuming place is easy to miss - we actually did and went down the hill behind it (don't do this, Edinburgh hills are no joke). They have a few tables and booths inside, and if you're there the one day a year it's not raining a few outside. It was magnificently sunny the day we stopped in, so we chose to hang out front. The menu is diner-esque, ranging from full breakfast options to sandwiches and pies. My fiance went with the mini breakfast (which was quite large) and I went with a Scottish meat pie, because, well, pie. Both were fantastic, but I would recommend opting for chips over the mash, as the whole pie + mash affair gets quite heavy (albeit delicious).   Come eat here for a central, affordable, and delicious option the next time you're in Edinburgh",

    "text": "We had the most delightful waiter (at least until about midway through our visit, when he took off - guess his shift was over!). He made everything so pleasant for us when we came in for brunch. He had some tourist tips for us, and he also let my son and youngest daughter help make the fresh squeezed orange juice (with the help of special juicing machine). Great juice they said! I had French toast with bacon. It was good, especially with both syrup and jam. My wife and oldest shared a ham and cheese panini, which they said was just ok. It was accompanied by fries and slaw, which they said were not good. Still, I give this little spot four stars for a friendly and fun brunch experience.",

    "text": "Honestly, this was such a fantastic find for breakfast. There was always one table available for us. The staff were all so friendly. Even with the Fringe Festival going on around us it was nice to just sit and have a bit of food here. If you can grab a seat outside, you spend all meal people watching. Inside is tight but cozy.   I grabbed the mini breakfast both visits. It was such a great size and not at all mini. One fried egg with two sausages, two slices of bacon, beans, toast. The works. The pies were really delicious and the gravy was perfect for dipping fries in. The pot of tea was perfect to warm you up for the Scottish morning.",

    "text": "***FAST, FILLING, AND REASONABLY PRICED***  I had just gotten into Edinburgh the night before and slept in so late that missed free breakfast at my hostel.  My breakfast dedication undeterred, I set out to get some authentic Scottish breakfast without breaking the bank.  I then stumbled upon Angus Fling Cafe, knowing the breakfast gods had answered my prayers.  For breakfast options, you can choose between an authentic Scottish, English, and American breakfasts. Naturally I went with the first one.  For about 8 and a have Euro, you get a fresh egg, tomato, potato patty, toast, beans, and a (surprisingly flavorful) black cake thing (pardon my touristy ignorance).  It was the perfect remedy to cure what ailed me! I didn't get a look at the lunch items but from what I could gaze on the tables around me the meals looked tip top.  Bottom line: If you're looking for a star quality meal at off Broadway prices, come to the Angus Fling Cafe!",

We were thrilled to find this place. They offer British, Scottish and American breakfast and a few other items. My husband, daughter and I each had a different breakfast and all of it as wonderful.   I wish I had insisted that my 11-year-old daughter try the Scottish breakfast but I also wish that my husband hadn't turned haggis into dare food by telling her what it was made of so there's that.   The food was great, perfectly done at a good price. I would highly recommend and since Edinburgh is my new favorite city ever I hope to eat there again. The staff was friendly and prompt, the location was clean and there were even tables out front just in case we developed a desire to eat in the rain.",

If you can find a place here, it'll be one of you best dining experiences in Edinburgh. The service is top notch. The waiter was incredibly attentive and engaging. The waiter made our meal very fun. My only complaint is that he got my son hooked on Irn-Bru (and we came here for breakfast). We had the English breakfast, the Scottish Breakfast, and the salmon and scrambled eggs and all three were perfect. This was the best Scottish breakfast that I had in Scotland and I had one of these almost every day while here. The prices were amazing considering the service and quality. The service is what makes this place special. I was also incredibly impressed with the respect that the cook and waiter showed toward each other. These guys are True professionals and gentlemen.",
