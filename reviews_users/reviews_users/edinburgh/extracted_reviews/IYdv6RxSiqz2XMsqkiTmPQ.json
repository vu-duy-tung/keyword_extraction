    "text": "Word of Mouth was the first place my friend (a former Leith-er) ever took me to in Leith. I was starving and she had some errands to run, so I promised that I'd go with her if and only if she took me somewhere good to eat. And she did. And I ate spanicopitta (delicious!) and something else I can't totally recall, but I remember it being fairly delicious and pretty affordable.  We didn't get to stay very long as my friend had to run to catch a train, but it felt like the kinda place I could definitely sit around drinking coffee and having wee bites to eat.",

    "text": "I think this place has a pretty cool name which is definitely in tandem with its clean, vibrant and almost retro image.  The interior is stylish and modern, but feels a bit ragged round the edge which suits the whole ambiance of the bistro.  I don't have a particularly sweet tooth but they have a huge range of tempting cakes and muffins.  Further, just about everything on the menu is made from ethical sources and its a strong advocator of Fairtrade produce.   I had the scrambled eggs on toast which had herbs mixed in with it and tasted delicious.  The service was friendly but everyone at the counter did seem to be waiting for quite a while.  Nevertheless, the food is certainly worth the wait and their lunchtime menu has plenty of tasty-looking and healthy Mediterranean options like olives with feta cheese and cured meat.   If this isn't enough they also do open mic and even poetry events which they advertise inside.  Word of Mouth is a great place to get health, tasty food or even some evening entertainment - well worth a visit.",

It's a really good cafe, slightly bohemian in feel with some great lunchtime choices. I had the lamb patties in tzatziki dip and pitta bread, which came with fries and salad. I couldn't quite finish it... not because it wasn't nice (it was) but because there was so much of it! This one definitely sands head and shoulders over the bulk of cafes (generally of the greasy spoon variety) in the Leith area.   Certainly lives up to its name - you'll want to spread the word!",

Chillout music (although the pace clearly changed as we left, music from 40's-50's to Indie Rock), the eclectic surroundings. I was however a little disappointed in the menu given previous reviews and found it more limited than what I was expecting. I had the morroccan cous cous sandwich - couscous stuffed into pita bread - the couscous was bland and the chilli mayonnaise, distinctly lacking in chilli. Frozen chips that were distinctly cardboardy. The boy was expecting his breakfast roll to have two halves of ciabatta, not one. Not sure where we missed out here. Despite that, WoM has heart, which is nice to see in any business, but it's probably not one I'll frequent.",

The chips looked so tasty (wish I'd had them now) and seemed to be covered in herbs.

The two times I've been, the experience has been spoilt by the staff. It appears that they run an outside catering business and the first time I went (with friends) they were too busy working at that to serve us (even when I approached the counter to order). The four of us ended up leaving, unserved. The second time, on my own, the service was fine, but it wasn't a very peaceful place to be because the staff were discussing their catering loudly in the seating area and shouting to staff downstairs.   It's relatively new, so hopefully these will just be teething difficulties.",

    "text": "Tucked away up a side street near Edinburgh's takeaway epicentre, finding Word of Mouth is like uncovering hidden treasure!  Individual, eclectic and carrying the personality of the staff, it is a rustic looking coffee shop selling hearty portions of healthy food. The menu is contained, but you are given many options as to what you desire on your sandwich or ciabatta bread. The staff make a wonderful coffee and boast of having a huge amount of veggie options.  My ciabatta was gorgeous. Went for the Greek fillings as usual (I am so boringly predictable) but it makes me a good judge of food from the Med since I've tasted enough sun dried tomatoes to know quality by now! I can happily report that my lunch was delicious, not to mention healthy - my ciabatta was engulfed by salad!  The staff were relaxed and breezy, but left me with a bit of peace and quiet to read my book as the Beatles played on in the background. But aside from all these plus points, what makes Word of Mouth so special for me is the fact it is entirely individual. It's personal, plays a part in Edinburgh's creative culture by hosting various evenings, and sells prints made by the people working in the shop. Its walls pay tribute to bygone era's, with a lot of 50s pin up art gracing the walls. It's not the kind of place where an employee is going to get sacked for wearing a headband and hanging a picture up in the wrong place, which is what wins me over most of all. With its kitschy, home kitchen appeal, hodge podge of wall art and card collections, I guess Jonathon was right in saying it fronts a coffee shop revolution of sorts. It's unique and isn't trying to be uniform, which is enough of a revolt against commercialism to get me coming back for more!",

The first gripe I heard was about the distance of the staff; apparently a bunch \"day dreamers\". This was not the case, they girl that served me was very friendly and asked me how my day was.  What sets this apart from the other numerous cafes in the city are the wonderful home made cakes. If you've read my reviews before you'll know I'm a sugar whore, so this place was bound to please me. I got a little fairy cake (nice manly blue one) and a latte which were actually very reasonable at about 3.  The only bad thing I can say is the seats out front are like being back at school. Book your chiropractor appointment before your visit.  The word of mouth...it's great!",

Nikki was able to bring her gorgeous wee four-legged pal along because (Major Bonus Points number one) it is dog-friendly. I ordered the lemon chicken wrap, which was (MPB#2) GIGANTIC. It came wrapped in flatbread, rather than a tortilla, so it was pretty (MBP#3) hefty, and (MBP#4) the filling was super-generous. And, more to the point, (MBP#5) extremely good. No doubt with regard to the lemony flavour, and the chicken delicate and tender... Word of Mouth, could you be any more wonderful? Methinks not. Five stars for you, my love.",

The yogurt parfait was actually really nice and didn't feel like a healthy cop-out, it's actually really enjoyable and if you get it, you won't necessarily feel envious of your neighbors and their meals.  Lots of yummy fruit flavor, a bit sweet - but I like it that way!  Pain au chocolate was quite good, very flaky and full of chocolatey goodness.  The full breakfast was a classic - really enjoyed the black pudding, dipping my crisp toast in the runny egg, and the savory bacon and sausage.

Downstairs there is a veritable treasure trove of crafty delights and gifts, ideally placed on the way to the loos. I find myself pottering around downstairs looking to spend pennies, before I actually, well, spend a penny.   There are paintings from local artists on the walls for you to buy, retro sweeties and a big selection of cakes and other sweet treats lining the counter. I've eaten here several times and the food has always been good.   Last visit saw me chow down on leek and potato soup with crusty bread. It was like a farmers' lunch - hearty or what.

    "text": "My fellow Leithers rave about Word of Mouth, but I live but a hop, skip and a jump away from the Bonnington Brunch so my breakfast roll allegiances lie there.  However, as the Brunch staff have recently selfishly decided that Sundays should be a day of rest, I'm without a cafe to supply me with sausage rolls on the Sabbath.  So far I've just restricted my breakfast roll habit to a Saturday, but as I recently had guests staying over who were in need of meat and bread I made the trip to Word of Mouth.  Alas! I have been spoilt by the Brunch's super cheap prices, and was aghast to see that Word of Mouth charged about 3.50 for a roll with 3 fillings, and about 2 (I can't remember exactly, might have been anywhere between 1.80 and 2.20) for one filling. That is an expensive roll when I'm used to a base price of 1.40 plus 40p per extra item.  Fortunately the quality of said rolls just about justifies the expense. These are ciabatta rolls (the owner said he much prefers them to normal bread ones), and the quality of the sausages, bacon, eggs etc is wonderful. Delicious. A bit mean to cut the link sausages in half so you actually only get 2 sausages in your roll, but tasty at least.  Now it only takes me a little over 10 minutes to walk there, but I feel that's too long to be walking back while my food is getting cold, so my trips there in future will be restricted to either sitting in or the rare occasions (such as last weekend) when I have the use of a car. And the vast difference in cost between it and the Brunch means I'll really only make the journey when I NEED a breakfast roll. But, the cafe itself looks lovely so it may well be that I'll be back soon - but for a sit-in lunch this time.",

    "text": "While staying in Edinburgh I set up camp in Leith Walk and happened upon this charming cafe which, all charm aside, happened to be a few blocks away.   Convenience alone drew me in the door but I'd be lying if I said convenience was the reason I kept coming back.      I ordered a \"veggie breakfast,\" which I'm not entirely sure is on the menu.  I wouldn't be surprised if they made it custom for me, the shop is just that kind of place.   It was a fried egg and mushrooms, over some flatbread, with a side of baked beans.   Sounds humdrum and ordinary but this is one of the best breakfasts I've had in the world.   So much so that after a tour of Scotland I planned a out of the way trip back to Leith Walk the morning before my flight out.   Add to that a cool atmosphere, down to earth locals, and dedicated staff you have a win win for my favorite cafe.   I only wish I lived in Edinburgh.      Check out the geometric graffiti mural on their shutters as well.   A great place with par excellence food and coffee, good energy and fantastic people.",

Being the True coffee snob I am I ordered tea and I can't say the coffee looked amazing, as the mild was really foamy, but again, coffee snob! I did however love the crepe I ordered. I think it had cheese and roast veggies and was very good, and was less then 4. A total steal! A nice little local, although I haven't gone back since. Would be keen to see if their breakfast is any good?!",

The breakfast (toast, beans, rashers, sausage, tattie scone, egg, black pudding, mushroom, tomato and what I think was sage and black pepper sprinkled over) was just what the doctor ordered for me. The Scottish breakfast tea I had was proper builders strength. Across from the breakfast roll looked damn appealing and the coffee was met with a look of approval.  The guys behind the counter were very nice and though the breakfast took a bit longer than I'm used to, the service was quite good. The cafe also has plenty of knick knacks on sale, from moustaches for your cupcakes to tat for your wall (or as the OH calls it 'Sara things') which I approve of.   As the OH isn't the smallest of guys we were a bit cramped on one of the middle tables so a bit more space would be nice but you can't have everything...*sigh*",

It's bad enough to not smile at customers, but to look at them as though they're something slightly puzzling that has blown in under the door really isn't the best customer service. I wondered if I had jam round my mouth, or twigs in my hair, but no, my companions got much the same look when they arrived. And an underwhelming apology when they had to send coffee back for being cold.  So - it's a nice wee cafe, the coffee was good (when it was hot) and the croissant delicious.

I like the fact Word of Mouth is away from the hubbub of the centre of town, tucked away down a side street off Leith Walk. No doubt a lot of Leithers will already frequent Word of Mouth, but the simple, wooden furniture, modern, coloured lamps hanging overhead and relaxed vintage feel of this cafe will definitely tempt me to walk a bit further away from town in the future. The staff were lovely, and the feeling of the clientele and the place was chilled out and easy. Much to my annoyance, I wasn't at all hungry, but the mezze section of the ethically sourced food menu looked fantastic, as did the homemade cakes on display. I also noticed the cafe holds performance poetry and music open mic nights, which felt entirely right to me, as this seems like the perfect venue for such events.",

Word of Mouth also happens to do some really cracking coffee and cakes, at reasonable prices too. There is a selection of hot foods too, including a mezze for around 15 which although I didnt try, I really really want to because all of the dishes looked amazing as I jealously watched others order. Staff are friendly, although they tended to be a little slow, but no matter because it realy is worth the wait.  Word of Mouth is a great little place thats doing things its own way, so pass it on.",

So how pleasantly surprised was I when what looked like your ordinary little cafe offered all sorts of unexpected treats?   My simple scrambled eggs on toast was made with rosemary and thyme (they also had pesto scrambled eggs on the menu, which sounded really good). My hot chocolate wasn't just simple Cadbury's mixed with water, but made with steamed milk, topped with whipped cream and marshmallows (which were nicely aged -- it sounds weird, but slightly stale marshmallows melt very nicely in hot chocolate).   They have free wifi and the staff were super friendly; we were the only ones in there and they were attentive but didn't hover.   Their lunch menu looked really good, too: lots of Mediterranean snacks like olives, feta, houmous, and halloumi.   I'll make a point of seeking it out the next time I'm in Edinburgh.",

I have to say that while the food is great, I did feel a wee bit uncomfortable when I was in here dining alone, which might have been largely to do with the big group of foreign students that were sat right next to me. It's a small space, so it couldn't really be helped but it made what started off as a nice quiet experience a rather unpleasant one!  That aside, the food is awesome. I had the butter beans served in a gorgeous tomato sauce, some grilled hollumi and olives with bread as a little Med feast to myself and it was yummy! It isn't the cheapest place but I wouldn't say it was unreasonably priced, and I enjoyed every mouthful.  Brilliant wee place, but I emphasise the 'wee', if you're in a big group then don't bother!",

It's outside of the main tourist belt and it felt and looked very much like a local coffee shop. I was surprised to see that they had a little grill behind the counter where they do all the cooking.   We enjoyed the Full Breakfast and the Veggie Breakfast. They'll definitely fill you up, but we found them to be just the right amount and not food-coma-inducing. I was a big fan of the veggie sausage, grilled tomatoes, and haggis!   Don't skip the haggis. I was pretty reluctant to try it (if you don't know what it is, Google it and you'll be reluctant too), but it's tasty! It tastes like a combination of blood sausage and black beans. Maybe that's a weird combo, but it's good. Try it, damnit!  Sorry, anyway. It's a nice spot for breakfast and doesn't feel touristy, though it's interesting that most of the reviews are from tourists. Regardless of who's eating there, it doesn't seem to get jam packed like some of the other spots in town. Give it a try!",

Croque's madame and monsieur are available, fresh brewed covfefe (sorry, it's the American spelling) to order and sweets galore. Free wifi and window seating, WoF is always an easy walk from which ever airbnb I happen to be staying.",

I was craving Benny's And coffee. It looked decent from the yelp page and it was fairly close to our hotel.  My friends and I got cafe lattes, English breakfast, and of the the Benny's. Seriously the best hollandaise ever!!!Eveything was fricking delicious. We traveled to London and paris and the breakfast here beats all of the pleases we ate previously. You have to come here. The only down side is that it doesn't come with hash browns hahah.   I still dream about he Benny and the cafe lattes...",

    "text": "The staff was very friendly as I came in with my giant dog to have a coffee and a bite while I waited for my phone screen to be replaced. It looked nice and cozy, and I figured I'd give it a go, despite not having my phone with me and I wasn't in a mood for going to a cafe blind without checking the Yelp rating.  Turns out, Yelp ratings wouldn't have helped...  When I asked for a flat white, he asked me if I wanted a single or double shot. Flat whites are always double shots, but whatever. That can just be a concession so you don't get questions from confused people who just want a weaker flat white while not angering the annoying nitpickers like myself who expect a flat white to be one thing and one thing only. I asked what size cup he uses, just as a precautionary measure, and the size of a double was a latte cup. Even the \"single flat white\" was bigger than the \"standard size\" of a FW. Fine. I did as I always do in these circumstances and asked for a double shot in the smaller of the cups.  Fine. Doesn't mean it's a BAD coffee. Again, good coffee places sometimes make concessions to not alienate the customers who aren't as Into Coffe as people like me.  I decided to go for an almond croissant as well, because they looked quite tasty there on the counter. the trouble with croissants is that they could be five years old and look EXACTLY the same as a fresh one! I'm not sure this one was much fresher than that... He asked me when I ordered if I wanted it heated, and I see why. It was just so dry and hard, even before I bit into it I could tell this wasn't fresh, just by hand-feel.  I didn't complain. What's the use? It wasn't like he would have made me a better coffee or magically found me a fresh croissant if I'd mentioned it. I paid and left and resolved to myself that a place called Word of Mouth should probably make sure that word of mouth would work in their favour.  Again, though: very friendly service and a cozy, wooden-chaired interior. Shame about the actual product.  (It's also entirely possible that I would have had a different experience had I ordered off the menu to get something freshly cooked. Problem is: now I'll never be back, so I won't find out)",

Only complaint is that at the end when we went to settle the bill my partner paid and I received criticism on 'letting' a woman pay. It wasn't friendly banter - I had to reply that the lady wanted to invite me, why the justification?",

It was casual and cosy, frequented by everyone from a couple on a date and a girl doing a faux interview to a woman reading a book and two guys taking a work break. There were flyers for local events near the bathroom.  My cup of tea was fine and my pastry was fresh. Because of the assortment of sweets in the counter, I didn't even realize there was a table service menu - but there is. I would return.",
