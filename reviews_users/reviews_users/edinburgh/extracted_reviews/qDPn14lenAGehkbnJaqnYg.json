    "text": "First sign that things had changed was the missing mobility scooter that was for ever parked outside the old place.  I hope the owner is still alive and well and has just powered on to another boozer.    Inside the new place is all leather couches and exposed brick work, and while this isn't really what I'm looking for in a pub, it hangs together pretty well. Decent beer on draft and a cocktail menu just calling out for one of my famous hangovers, I think this place will quickly establish itself.  I didn't eat, but the food looked pretty good....burgers actually looked exceptional.   The only trouble for me is the position. I'm Bruntsfield based but if I'm going for a pint I'm more inclined to choose a place off the main routes into town.  This area has always felt like a space I have to walk through to get home so I never really feel like hanging around for any length of time. Maybe the Blackbird will change that.",

I ordered fish and chips, which to the chefs' credit arrived in good time. My battered fish was square (have you ever seen a square fish?) meaning the fish was stacked on top of itself and the batter to flesh ratio was waaaaay off. You order fish and chips for the battery goodness - there needs to be a bit of crunch when you eat the fish!  The plate of food was just totally average. Nothing to write home about. But it set me back a tenner. Ouch. It was also presented on a piece of wood, a pet hate of mine. I went with a group of Yelpers and some of their dishes looked like winners, so perhaps I ordered the wrong thing?  Also, bring a torch if you want to read what's on the menu. There's not much light to see anything and the words are black ink on brown paper. Argh!",

    "text": "I spent the second half of my summer flitting between my parents home and Edinburgh. I passed this place in late August and as far as I noticed it was still the former old-man pub and when I next saw it in early September it was The Blackbird. Interested, a group of 5 of us went along, I think it was perhaps the 2nd or 3rd night of business and it was reassuringly busy.  A mixture of folk but the prevailing demographic was well-heeled 30-somethings. It seemed busy as people tended to cluster near the door but further back in this narrow but long-ish pub there was space to be found. I ordered my drink but waited, genuinely, 5 minutes for it to arrive. Initially being the only lad in our group the barman, disguising it as beer advice, spent the ensuing time chatting up my mates. I thought he'd forgotten all about me and was about to re-order from his colleauge when he began to pour it. OK. Nice pint, not much change from a fiver.  The decor is OK. It is fresh and it is trendy but it all seemed pretty dark. Colour and lighting. Maybe that's trendy too though. Soon, a couple more joined our party and orders were taken from the table by a waitress, just for two pints. Over a ten minute period the drinks were chased up twice. A very polite girl came round 4 times for empties before the fullies eventually arrived with apologies. I could probably have turned up with 20 supermodels and been served quicker at the bar.  This place is potentially cool, and given the benefit of the doubt the drinks fiasco was probably teething problems.  On the up-side Blackbird has several London-brewed beers (on tap as well as bottled), so you can just pretend you're in London when you get silver back from your 5 and have a lovely night looking at the pretty girls and boys.  We enjoyed the night, but we haven't been back yet.",

    "text": "Best enjoyed in the sun  I'm glad I waited to review this place after a few visits, as if I based it on my first experience it would have been lucky to get 3 stars. It seems they have got their act together a bit, and I'm happy for them. I hope to become a regular here ....  Service is very casual, trendy beautiful people are relatively attentive, though quite happy to chat among themselves which can be a bit annoying. The decor is best described as Urban, my favourite part being the mini fire cans they use for ashtrays in the beer garden.  The beer garden is awesome, one of the best in town, and you don't get the student masses that other beer gardens tend to attract. It fills fast, so get there early, and they do table service outside, which is a massive bonus - though if you are peely wally like me its often good to walk inside and stop the freckles from merging into one.  I can understand some of the below comments about the food, it was my biggest disappointment first time round, but since then (take note Blythe!) the burger has come on leaps and bounds. Its no gastronomic delight, but good modern pub food, and decent sized portions.",

The decor was understated and quite chilled.  The bathrooms were immaculate which is a bug bear of mine.

There probably aren't enough staff on the bar and if they are serious about doing cocktails then this will need to change. As it stands making a cocktail or even a latte seems to be at the detriment to the service of those just wanting a pint.  One plus, though a little irrelevant for this time of year, they have made a nice job of the beer garden/outdoor seating area.  I may return (perhaps in a few months they will have found the right balance) but I won't be rushing back.",

    "text": "the blackbird left me disappointed.  i had such high hopes since i'm a big fan of both hamiltons in stockbridge and treacle on broughton street.  somehow though, the blackbird doesn't hold the same charm of either of these places and it just fell flat for me.  i'd met with a group of yelpers for a pre-theatre dinner and drink and on first entering i really liked the space.  there is two rooms (and possibly what appears to be a beer garden out the back...?) that are decorated in a sort of shabby chic old man pub/trendy bar mix.  i liked it, definitely the sort of place i would wander into based on appearance alone.  the waitress was helpful letting us order our dinners as we arrived when we explained we were happy to have the dishes arrive at different times.  i opted for the veggie burger which sounded tasty.  it was a mix of chick peas, broad beans, and cumin with a cucumber raita.  i definitely thought it would be awesome, but the burger was a bit bland, rather dry and crumbly and i didn't taste any cucumber raita at all.  the chips were tasty, they were of the potato wedge variety and could have been a bit more cooked.  the small salad was fresh and had a really tasty dressing, which i think was actually my favourite part of the meal!  oh wait, that would be the glass of house red, which was fruity and tasty and easy to drink.  definitely enjoyed that, but can hardly give credit to the blackbird kitchen for pouring me a good glass of wine.  paying at the end of the meal was a bit chaotic.  they agreed we could pay seperately, but then just handed us a print out of the whole bill and asked us to tell them how much we wanted to pay.  umm ok, not brilliant customer service and i'm pretty sure in an effort to make things easy on myself i may have over paid a pound or two.  i put this down to my annoyance of telling the waiter behind the bar what i ordered so he could tell me what i owed but then he just walked away and started talking to one of the other wait staff.  so just no, customer service seriously lacking!  i'm not impressed with the blackbird and will not be rushing back.  it's handy for a pre-theatre drink if you're going to the kings theatre but not much else unfortunately.",

    "text": "The Blackbird is a new bar/restaurant near Bruntsfield in Edinburgh. I had read about it in the Evening News and online and decided to try it out for dinner with a group of friends. The bar is owned by the same team who own Treacle in Broughton Street and Hamilton's in Stockbridge. As I am a big fan of both, I had high expectations for The Blackbird, which I am glad to say were exceeded!  First of all, the place looks incredible! I remember it when it was the Auld Toll and it is like a completely different place. They have cleverly separated the dining and bar area and there are wonderful exposed brick walls, vintage mirrors, beautiful and colourful artwork as well as a huge Alice in Wonderland inspired mural which is very cool. We were shown our table in the dining area and given menus at once. I found the staff very helpful and friendly, the whole experience was very comfortable. I ordered the crispy chick pea and broad been burger which came with home cut chips. I'm not actually a vegetarian but this looked too good to pass up and it was delicious. One of my friends had the roast half chicken which she loved and my other friend had grilled salmon which I think had chorizo through it. Yum.  The drinks list was fab. As I hoped, the cocktail list was just as extensive as Hamilton's and Treacle and the staff were great at recommending drinks for us.  We had such a good night at The Blackbird, I am anxious to go back! A brilliant addition to the area.",

My friend and I were shocked to see the drinks menu cover, which had incredibly racist imagery and text of Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee as monkey-like figures with giant red lips that STRONGLY resembled blackface. Underneath was a quote from Dirty Dancing - \"I carried a watermelon\".  When we asked our very nice server, she said the intention wasn't racist, that other people had called it into question (someone had written \"is this acceptable\" and \"racist\" on ours), and that it would be expensive to reprint.   I support local business and don't think customers being easily offended is a reason they should lose money. But this is not a case of that.   The historical significance of that imagery should offend everyone, and that cover NEEDS to be removed. With the combination of the blackface and the watermelon text, it seems far too coincidental to be an accident. Changing it would prove it was not intentional. Leaving it would make me question their motives, and until they do, I wouldn't visit again.",

Despite that fact and what seemed like a plethora of bar staff, it took an amazingly long time for our orders to be taken and our drinks to be served.  It took so long, if several of my friends hadn't already placed their orders, I simply would have thrown in the towel and left...  My friends having already crossed the Rubicon, I decided to make the best of it.  Fifteen minutes later, it took me FOUR times repeating my order before it was finally taken.  I've had that problem in bars sometimes at midnight, but it was only 5pm!!  Quite some time after we arrived, our food and drinks finally came.  The food was well presented, and when the service actually started, service was quick and efficient.    Bottom line: despite a reasonably good ending to the experience, the monumental waste of our time waiting and ordered tainted my experience here.  I definitely won't come back for another meal, but I might be persuaded to come back for a cocktail if one of my friends really had a craving for this place.",

    "text": "I am generally an accepting person.  Hence it is not lightly I leave a 1 star review for a business. The reason? Total lack of professional behaviour on the staff's part.  I witnessed staff ignoring customers, playing on their phones until it was convenient for them to look helpful, not giving full measures, and, unbelievably, doing rows of shots in front of customers and while said customers were waiting to be served. Added to the fact it was totally overpriced, even by Edinburgh standards, I was not impressed.",

    "text": "Had dinner here with four friends whilst we were all visiting Edinburgh. Our table was booked for 8pm on a Saturday, and the place was absolutely heaving with people in the bar area.  We had a nice table, and although the menu isn't huge everything sounded delicious. Probably not the best place for veggies as there was only one option that I could see.  I had Toulouse sausages with butter beans and herbed gnocchi. The sausages were amazing, definitely cooked over coals, with a wonderful crisp skin and smoky exterior. My only quibble were the gnocchi, more like the size of dumplings, and very sticky - not what I was expecting. Luckily the generous serving of sausage and the butter bean sauce saved it for me.  We all shared the 'Elvis' deep fried peanut butter and jam brioche sandwich for dessert. Although it looked really impressive I found the taste quite bland.",

    "text": "A tad disappointed by The Blackbird on this visit and this seems to be replicated across all the Yelpers on this night. We were meeting up prior to our theatre trip for a bit of food and being just across from the Kings Theatre makes it a perfect location.  Looks wise, I would pop in if I was in the area. Its a few months old, but still a bit sparkly and new, with lovely (unstained) cushions and comfy seating. It's the type of place where you and a few friends get together for a great catch up over a few drinks. It is a popular place and was busy on a Tuesday night which is always a good sign.  Food wise, it was disappointing. Being gluten free options are limited - food is very pub like so fried, deep fried and battered but the burgers (minus the bun) are GF. My burger was disappointing. No great flavour and over cooked so a bit dry (nothing in comparison to the Southern). I subbed the chips for pumpkin in chili oil. It was lovely and comes served in its own little metal pan but near the bottom, there was too much oil. Fellow Yelper Katey ordered the chicken which looked lovely, as did Jenny L's venison and pumpkin mash. I had tried to view the menu prior to going but apparently the website is coming soon - fine if the place isn't open, not so when its been going for several months in this digital age...  So, I can imagine I would go back for drinks, but I probably wouldn't for dinner due to the limited options. It is a nice place, I just wasn't blown away.",

    "text": "Finally made it to The Blackbird! Had this place on my list for quite some time and was happy to have a chance to pop in. First impressions? Nice decor, easy location, friendly staff. As a past server/bartender I have to say that I really judge a place on how they treat you when you come in during that odd period between lunch and dinner. So many times you are either ignored or get less-than-stellar service. High five to our server who was on point and very good!  As for the food and drinks, it was 3pm on a weekday, so we were not getting our drink on (sadly), but the cocktail menu looked pretty awesome. Was satisfied with my plain ginger beer. As for food, I had one of the best 'meat boards' I have come across in Edinburgh (sausage, HUGE breaded shrimp, jerk chicken, DELICIOUS BBQ ribs). Up there with Three Birds meat board, which I also love. Everything seemed nicely homemade (bloody mary ketchup? yes, please) and had good flavor and seasoning (pet peeve!). Our fish and chips was also very good. Not too heavy on the breading and a killer caper tartar sauce. Only thing I didnt really love about Blackbird was the jerk chicken and the fries. The chicken was very dry and sort of low on the flavor. As others have said, the fries here are one of my pet peeves. No one wants huge, soft potato wedges in a cup. Give me a thin, crispy fry or give me death!",

Pros:  - they have hoegarden on tap (at least they did when I was there last) - the aforementioned beer garden  - good bar food - especially lunch. I typically go do the po' boy sandwich  - great location. You're not really in town (a la George street or Cowgate) but it's a busy and burgeoning area   Cons  - toilets can be hit or miss (I once walked into a stall w a floater) - can be busy at times especially during nice sunny days   Overall a great place to enjoy some good times and high fives.",

    "text": "I never like to leave a bad review for a place and like to give most places a second chance but this is the first time in a very long while that I felt compelled to walk out of a bar due to the service. The decor of the place was great, it looked very appealing from the outside and was pleasant within. Once my girlfriend and myself fought our way to the bar we were greeted by an extremely uninterested barmaid who was more focused on taking shots (yes she did a shot in front of us) than serving customers. After paying what I can only describe as \"London prices\" for two drinks we enjoyed our drinks while standing at the bar. Meanwhile a guy with disabilities waiting to be served next to us was passed over and ignored by the bar staff for a good 10-15 minutes. The final straw was when two young women approached the bar to be service were encouraged by the barman to push us out of the road to be served even though there was space besides us at the other side of the bar to be served. Once my girlfriend and I were shoved out of the road and drawn dirty looks from the barman I simple put my drink down on the bar and left as I was extremely annoyed by this and didn't want to ruin our weekend away.  I would recommend people give this place a wide berth. The staff are extremely unprofessional, drinking while on shift and too busy playing on their mobiles and flirting with each other instead of serving customers.",

Not comfertable and I was struggling to get comfertable. Finally settling at a table in the back I feld like Alice in Wonderland as the table side came to just under my shirt pocket. I am 5'9\" when standing up so this was a little awkward. I was pleasantly surprised with the platter that was served and the beer selection is good . In all I would have liked it here more if it wasn't for being so uncomfertable.  They have a small but well presented food list - vegetarian option and locally sourced. As they were just opened the portions were generous when I visited, but as with many places that serve food that will probably be evened out over time.",

    "text": "One word... disappointed!   I've been looking forward to visiting The Blackbird for quite a while now. I finally went there with the Yelp book club this week and it wasn't. I love it inside, it's nice and cosy, I really like the decor, the lighting is subtle, all just lovely. The problem lies with the food...  I ordered Chorizo and Roasted red peppers on a toasted ciabatta. It turned up on a wooden board (of course, everything does now) and the chorizo and red peppers were in a mini frying pan which was quite sweet, they were fine, not amazing, just fine. The 'ciabatta' however was non existent. What I was presented with was a tiny end peice of chewy, slightly stale white bread. It was awful and I wasn't really sure what I was meant to do with it. I was starving so I chewed on it for a while but didn't finish it. Plus it was just so dry I didn't really have anything to eat it with apart from the tiny amount of oil from the chorizo.  Oh and another thing, their website has been 'coming soon' for quite sometime now. I wish it would just get here. And I also wish they'd respond on Twitter.  I will go back, but just for a drink. The cocktail menu looks fab so hopefully they are as good as they sound and The Blackbird redeems itself!",

Tollcross has lots of good dining options, so this place is for pre- or post-prandial drinks, only.  Overall, we said: \"while the Blackbird is quite a smart place, and I thought the service rather good, it needs to get to work on improving its menu. The burger I had was one of the saddest I've tried, to date. It was way too lean, and pretty much just a waste of good beef. As it stands, I'd say come for drinks, but eat elsewhere.\"",
