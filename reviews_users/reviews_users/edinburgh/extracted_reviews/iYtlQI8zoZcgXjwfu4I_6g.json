    "text": "We stumbled in, as the other Korean restaurant I was wanting to go to was closed. Lucky us, because this place did not disappoint. I haven't had lots of Korean food before, so wasn't sure what to expect exactly. They were full, but offered us one table by the counter. The service was very friendly, but slow, however, we weren't in a hurry so didn't mind. Not long after being seated we received some small dishes, one with peppered bean sprouts, one with a picked radish and the other some potatoes. All were so tasty and a nice complimentary starter!   We started with the kimchi omelet, which was unbelievably delicious! Very good flavor and texture, I could eat one every day. I ordered the raw fish salad for my main and my partner got a beef noodle dish. My salad had fish that was very tasty and fresh, with a mix of veggies and a very nice spicy sauce on the side with rice included in the salad. I really enjoyed it and it wasn't too heavy as I feel my stomach can think with Chinese. My partner really enjoyed his broth and noodles, which also came with a side of rice. I can't fault the food in any way.  All in all a delicious meal and I will certainly go back to try more! It is also BYO, so that will be happening next time. A very casual, homey place to enjoy a good bite!",

    "text": "Alex G. My wife and I found this treasure last Sat 29th Dec. We were impressed with the friendly, happy and smiley welcome and were quickly shown to a table. As this was our first experience of Korean cuisine, the lovely girl explained a few items for starters and what were main courses. We were soon into the menu. Our starters were two omelettes with side dishes, they were very tasty and enjoyable. Our mains were huge but very wholesome with veggies, meat and rice, we began to think we need not have had the starters. But we finished the meal completely and extremely satisfied. We washed the meal down with jasmine tea a grand accompaniment. We are now looking forward to our next visit, which we hope to be soon.",

    "text": "So before i begin, let me just say my context for Korean food is primarily in America and Korea. Or course, i didn't expect the quality/authenticity of Korean food in Scotland to match those of Korea or even America. Still, i was fairly disappointed in the amount of ban chan. Didn't give you a lot...i could actually say they gave you a little. And sul lung tang was ok at best. The meat they used was stringy and rough.",

    "text": "Great Korean restaurant. Even better than Kim's although Kim's is on the Michelin list. Exactly the same taste I had in my Korean classmate's home. A very small restaurant with reasonable prices so better reserve a table before coming. They serve a great variety of food and a soup with shellfish and tofu was the best Korean food I ever had(name forgotten). Great place to dine with two or three friends in a cold winter night.surely would like to go again.",

    "text": "Finally got to try this place over the weekend and to quote an old movie, \"can you just be whelmed?\" Because that's what the experience was.   The service was friendly but quite slow though the place was only half full. The decor is minimal and furniture looks like it's from everyone's favourite flat pack box store.  My friend and I got a large kimchi jigae to share and it's kept warm on an electric hot plate which although great to keep the soup hot, completely dominated the table which made eating seem really cramped. The dish itself was tasty enough but didn't blow me away.  The small side dishes were potato, bean sprouts and cucumber.. All pickled or glazed as per usual Korean fare.  This is the third restaurant on the street serving Korean food and they'll need to up their game to become my top choice.",
