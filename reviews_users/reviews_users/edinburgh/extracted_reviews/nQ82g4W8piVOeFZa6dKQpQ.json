    "text": "Excellent Chinese takeaway in Newington. I have been to Hot Kungfu with friends many times, and I've never been disappointed.  The food is always prepared fresh and quite quickly. Prices are good and include rice, which I always thought was the norm but often is not the case in Edinburgh. Drink prices are also good value, so I can get an entire meal for 6-7. You can't really beat that.  Food tastes good, staff are friendly, and there is an efficient delivery service too, if you're not able to collect. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Popped in here to order a little bit of takeaway on a rainy Friday night. Contrary to the other reviews I have seen online, I actually found the service to be quite friendly. Though when I asked what the difference really is between the large dish and the small dish, I was just told the large dish is bigger than the small dish. The food itself was not bad, it didn't exactly blow me away. I went for the small chicken chow mien (no veg because I am weird like that), which is actually is quite big, so who knows what the large is like! The chicken was a little on the dry side but the noodles were pretty good.",
