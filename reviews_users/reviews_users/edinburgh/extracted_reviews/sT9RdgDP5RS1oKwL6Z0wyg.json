Oh boy it's just too tempting! A nice bag of chips, salt and brown chippie sauce. 1.40 for a bag of chips does seems a lot but they are good.   A very busy little place so be prepared to queue, however they have a very efficient system for serving so you do get served quite quickly.",

We once ordered a huge stack of different suppers to bring home for a crowd of visiting guests and everything was spot on. We even converted a couple of guests to the deep fried mars bar!",

    "text": "The staff here really are first class so I do feel a bit bad saying this, but the food on offer isn't quite as good as what you might get elsewhere and even though it isn't expensive I cannot recommend this as a place to get an easy dinner.  Where it does do well, however, is with its convinience.  It's right on the bus stop, so if you're waiting for a bus it does seem very handy and will tempt you into a sale.  I must admit, I've only ever been here at the end of a night out and at that point it generally does the job required of it, but it's nothing to write home about.",

    "text": "In my opinion, the best chippy to be found in the Tollcross area. They generally get the chips spot on, and they are much crispier and less soggy than the kebab shops' chips for some reason.   Although to be honest, if it's 3 in the morning and you've just been out all night, it really doesn't matter which greasy chip shop you go to. It's all the same when you're wasted.",

    "text": "Chips with chippy sauce are decent, and they have a bizarre collection of grocery items. If you ever need Rice Krispies, dog food or loo roll at 2am, Concorde is your place. Otherwise pretty standard chip shop fare.   However, this is one of the cleanest take-aways ever. Even empty shelves and the window sills are scrupulously clean, which shows a certain attention to detail if nothing else.",
