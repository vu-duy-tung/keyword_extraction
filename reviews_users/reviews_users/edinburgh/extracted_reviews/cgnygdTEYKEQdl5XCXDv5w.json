It has a great patio view and well decorated.  The staff was very friendly.  It wasn't too noisy either.  The most important part, the food, was awesome.  Both of us had the Chef's Surprise, which was a three course meal, and loved it.  I was not given any discount or any other type of compensation for this posting.",

The food is upmarket without being pretentious; and if I can't speak of their desserts that at least tells you the portions are more than hearty and didn't leave any room to try them! My companion qualified her starter of tomato and basil soup as pretty much a meal in itself.   Very good service too in formal yet relaxed surroundings. Don't watch the large clock on the wall and let your lunch hour go...",

The next day after attending the \"Open\" at Muirfield, we went back for dinner and it was the opposite of the day before. The food was not good, especially not worth the dinner prices they charged. The first waitress was bad , but the second waitress was nice and a good waitress. it was a classic example of Dr Jekyl and Mr. Hyde from a restaurant quality standpoint. I would have second thoughts about going back.",

Heads up, prefix ends earlier in the day! Either way, the menu looked tasty so we settled in, grabbed a gin and tonic and decided on what we wanted.   The space was nice and cozy with multiple areas that you can tuck a larger party without being overwhelming. They did not have wifi and since it is a lower level, I didn't have wonderful service. That did not bother me much. I can live without wifi for an hour and a half.   The servers were incredibly nice, albeit a little absent minded (forgot a few items and we had to remind them). I decided to get the spring greens risotto with lemon. My mother got a burger. Chuck got fish and chips. I am SO happy that I got the risotto. It was very tasty. It was filled with crispy kale and peas. I really enjoyed it but I wish there was a touch more lemon flavor.  I would like to return and see if they have other seasonal flavors as the year goes on.",

The waitress was new on her first day. She had great support from her colleagues though. I had a beer recommended to be like Guinness, but wasn't anything like it. Old Engine Oil beer. I should have had water too. For my meal, I had a burger with a slice of haggis on top and french fries. My second go around with haggis and I had a bite of it plain to see how it tastes. On the burger it was perfectly good too. I had coffee to end the night. The desserts looked fabulous, but I was so full, I couldn't do it. It was a super meal, quick efficient staff, and i'd go back if I didn't live in the USA. I was not rushed in the least either.  The only odd thing was my check said gratuities had not been included which was a first for me in Europe. I had added 10%. I hope that was ok.",

    "text": "We stumbled in here randomly looking for a place for lunch near the castle that was completely jammed. We really didn't know what to expect, but with half our party getting \"hangry\", we thought it best to just go in and take our chances. Luckily, we were able to get a table for 4 right away.  Small cozy place, with friendly service and good (but not amazing) food. The lunch specials are a fantastic value, however. 10 gets you a starter and main - you'd struggle to find a better deal than that in this part of town. I started with the soup and followed with the fish of the day. They were both nice. One thing to note: My dad ordered the veal and it was served medium-well, so if you like your veal a bit more on the pink side (like me), make sure you request it specifically because they don't ask how you'd like it.  I wouldn't make a special trip out but for the price and convenience of location, it was perfect for us that day.",

It's quite similar to the Olive Branch with the same quality feel, nice ambiance and great food, but it shows its autonomy through its new patisserie which offers some great pastries and cakes.   I came here for dinner with some friends only a couple of weeks ago and we all had a top meal with quick service and amazing food.  The menu has an excellent selection of meat and vegetable dishes which all sound amazing.  I went for the smoked salmon starter followed by the grilled chicken with cheesy mash and asparagus.   Both tasted incredible and were served in filling portions.  The quality of the food, however, does come at a price.  We paid about 17 each for our meals.  This is definitely a case of getting what you pay for.",

It's easy to walk past due to being below street level which is a real shame but being selfish it does mean that I've not struggled to get a table!  One of the best and most unique things about it is the Chef's Surprise! Which basically does as it says on the tin.. if opting for the Chef's Surprise the waitress just asks what if anything to avoid (gluten for me as Im Coeliac) and anything you really like and thereafter it's up to the Chef to come up with a new and different two or three course meal! I've had this a few times and have yet to be disappointed, have tried things I probably wouldnt have ordered from a menu and really enjoyed them!  We booked through toptable and so received 20% off the food bill which makes for fantastic value for money! Definately worth trying!!",

Worrying as there were only 2 other covers in at that time. It then took 15 mins to take our drink and food orders. The starter arrived pretty quick but we ordered the artisan bread to share. It was lovely and fresh and soon disappeared. It then took another 15 minutes to take away our dirty plates. We then sat there for an hour waiting for our mains. I had ordered the fish and chips. The chips were cold and soggy and the fish was more batter than fish. The tartare sauce also had an unusual taste, I couldn't quite work out was was different or wrong with it. By that point I just wanted to leave. We tried to get the staffs attention but we were ignored. Only when a new waitress started her shift did we get the attention you would expect in a restaurant and we just got the bill and left. We noticed that many of the other tables that came in after us were also getting extremely frustrated and the table next to us were given food without cutlery and when they asked for some it took a long time to resolve.

This, however, certainly isnt the case for The Cellar Door, which professes itself as a restaurant, chocalatier and patisserie all at the same time.   The restaurant itself is a nice little place, tucked away on the ground floor of a building facing onto George IV bridge. Its smartly decorated, and certainly has the feeling of being 'new'.   I was genuinly impressed at how nice the staff were, even on a wednesday afternoon which had the Cellar Door full of people. The food was excellent, although my girlfriend complained that hers was a tad on the cold side, but again to the staffs credit, she waited only a few moments before a fresh (and almost too warm) plate was brought out which was good.  I really like this place, mostly for the friendly staff and the quality of the food,and it would have earned five satrs had that small hiccup not happened!",

No idea how good the wine list is so holding off with the stars but my haggis fritters with sides of cauliflower cheese (very good indeed) and chunky chips went down a treat and my companion loved her burger. We shared the chocolate trio dessert and it too provided no reason for complaint. I've eaten here a couple of times since first writing it up and it's maintaining the same good standards of service & quality of dishes. Following the very tasty ham hock terrine last night I opted for the 2 course surprise (19.95) so ended up with well cooked duck with black pudding & mash followed by a good sized tart with peanut ice cream. Washed down with a decent bottle of Grenache this was 34 well spent. Repairing the hole in the wall in the gents, having the toilet pertition secured to the floor & changing either the towel dispenser or the brand of towel so, as to avoid them spilling out into the sink, would enhance the experience further.",
