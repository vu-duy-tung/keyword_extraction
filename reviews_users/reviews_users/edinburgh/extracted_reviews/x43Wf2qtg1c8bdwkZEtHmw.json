The food is average, the music is average and staff are friendly enough, the place is clean enough...it's boring. The cost of the food is literally the average of the 5 other places I checked out that day...Yes, I was so bored I did the math.   It's not a bad place, but it's certainly not worth writing to your aunt peggy about.",

    "text": "I have to laugh because I feel the exact same way as Sam, when he said that the word 'guts' in the name of a sandwich shop conjures up all sorts of images that makes me want to keep on walking by. Eww.  This place is like a snack van without the wheels, you won't find anything fancy in here, and when I went in the place was mobbed with workies in dirty boots filling up on rolls and sausage and cups of tea in polystyrene cups. I couldn't really see anything I liked, so I politely bought a can of juice and made an exit. The fillings weren't varied and the fridge didn't actually look as though it was on, which really put me off.  For builders, van drivers and workies. Not for me!",

    "text": "There's something about the word 'guts' and the general sloppy, greasy nature of the food that puts me off this place.   Nonetheless you should expect the usual builder's favourites of sausage and egg rolls with a generous dollop of brown sauce and other portable greasy spoon fare.  Cheap and cheerful, but not tempting enough to lure you all the way down to Leith.",

Apparently thats the reason they called the place Greedyguts in the first place, if you believe local legend. I enjoy sandwiches, rolls, soup, salads (and most definitely baked treats), all of which you can receive promptly, efficiently and reliably from the dutiful staff at Greedyguts.",
