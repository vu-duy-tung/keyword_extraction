This place gets a 5 star on 2 important counts:  1. Value for money. I got a massive chicken wrap and a can of juice for 4. It was almost too big, i think if you're the kinda person who doesn't want a big lunch a salad or simple roll my be better suited.  2. Quality of food. OMGZ tasty! Maybe I was hella hungry, but my spicy chicken wrap was sooooooo good. My usual haunt has been shut last 2 weeks so I've been trying out a bunch of places which have mostly been bland and over priced but not these guys.   Their service system is a little unusual, it feels like there's 3 queues at once, but it all seems efficient enough.  I'd highly recommend getting to this place for lunch if you're even vaguely nearby.",

    "text": "Let Me Eat is an unassuming cafe that serves wraps, salads and paninis, but don't judge a book by it's cover - the food is wonderful, and the portion sizes are Ginormous!  You can easily make an entire meal out of what might be described as a \"snack\" here.  Last time I visited, I wanted a wrap - they had four vegan options, so I decided to go that way and was very happy about my choice.  The roasted veg wrap was great - it was made fresh in front of me, completely delicious, and big enough to choke a horse!  Let Me Eat is a delicious, healthy choice - recommended!",

    "text": "Salads! Really good salads! Inexpensive! In Edinburgh!   Excellent spot for lunch in grassmarket. I came here on my lunch break today after passing by many times, and I'm so glad I finally decided to pop in. It's a nice spacious cafe. I got my food for take away but I could definitely see myself enjoying a tasty lunch inside too.  I was so so excited to see a large lists of salads on their menu. And quite a range, too! I spotted chicken caesar, roasted vegatable, falafel, tuna salad, many options for whatever your taste. They also have coffee, paninis, a breakfast menu, and more menu items that I can't remember. I opted for the roasted pear salad. It. Was. Delicious. And such a deal for 3.95 for the large size! The man at the counter (might be the owner?) let me know it would be a little while to prepare the salad so I took a seat and flipped through some newspapers. It really wasn't that long of a wait, and it was definitely worth any extra time. Lovely leafy lettuce, tasty slices of bacon, bits of blue cheese, toasted walnuts, sweet roasted pear, and a balsamic dressing. Mmm. And he threw in some free bread!  The staff were extremely friendly and personable, and I hope more people visit their cafe! A great addition to the area. I will definitely be back to try out the rest of their menu.",

    "text": "Since starting work round here this has become my go to place for coffee and lunch!  As Joe.A says the main event is for the sure the Weeping Tiger Wraps on Wednesday and Friday but in general they just do awesome and generous food! I try to have their salads most days, lots of toppings and tasty dressings make even lettuce taste good!  Their Polish specials are always a treat, the perogi and the beetroot soup two of my favourites.  Cool staff and a particularly cute & witty girl that works the till at lunchtime make for a pleasant break when getting lunch. They also do a great very well priced coffee.  The music also randomly adds to the experience with some particularly good jazz played most days.  Maybe not as refined as their neighbour but more heart and more banter!",

    "text": "Strength to strength, what more can I say.  Their rolls and wraps are absolutely packed. You can opt for their menu's best (personally recommend the Garlic Cheddar Chicken), or you can play jazz and request whatever filling you like within their means.  Their soups are diverse and plentiful. Personal faves include Teriyaki Beef, Mexican Chilli Chicken, Bombay Potato or their authentic Polish soup, Jarzinowa.  Their coffee has been lauded in the local papers, check out their front window if you doubt. I'm no coffee man but their equipment is high end and their menu again looks diverse and interesting (Vietnamese specials?).  But the latest addition to their menu deserves a star all its own. Tuesdays and Fridays see Michal {mee-hal} and Piotr break out the Weeping Tiger Wraps. Sometimes pulled pork, sometimes pulled beef. But each and every time it coem served up with onions, tomato and lettuce, packed generously, wrapped up tight and toasted til lightly browned. They are what Friday lunchtimes are AAAAALLLL about!  Go out of your way for one of these beasts. They are magnificent.  On top of all the wonderful offerings above, the owners and their staff are constantly friendly, even in rush hour. If you are lucky enough to become a regular, and you give them enough banter to remember you, it's most likely they will reward your chat or tips with a freebie once in a while. Absolutely great service and a proper gem in Edinburgh.  PS. They also have some of the best music to ever play out of a lunchtime deli.",

A bonus is the chilled vibe and pumping music (sometimes classical), even for a few minutes it's a contrast to the work day.",

    "text": "My review might be a wee bit biased because Ive come to be pals with these guys but as far as lunchtime meals go, there really isn't anywhere better in Edinburgh.   The first thing that springs to mind is the amount these guys give you! How many times have you come away from a  cafe thinking they are obviously counting every piece of chicken/lettuce/tomato etc? At this place they just throw on half a chicken!   it's also cheap and much cheaper than their disinterested neighbour, Foodies. hell, I've had so many free coffees and even the odd lunchtime vodka from these guys, it's just another great aspect.   Food aside, the guys are great and play some great music. The short haired girl who works there is so lovely and looks like something out of a French New Wave film.   Just go, you really won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Ok...... so this place just opened today so it was maybe a little disorganised, maybe a little frantic when the lunch rush hit...... but I liked it!   The best thing about this place- it is MEGA cheap! All the paninis, sandwiches and salads are under 3! Granted my tuna nicoise salad wasn't huge but it was all I needed! And 2.85 or so, for a smoked salmon salad...... pass me three!!!   The coffee was tasty and strong. The service was nice and friendly, they didn't look at me like I was crazy when I asked if the tuna had Mayo in it, clearly sensing I didn't want, that the reply was- Yes, but we can make one up for you without it. Brilliant!!   Only downside to sitting in to have my quick lunch today is that the table/seats are those awful diner-style things that i hate, they are not comfortable. But I guess this place is more for grabbing something to takeaway. Overall I enjoyed it and would go back for sure!",
