    "text": "Great place with fresh food on my commute to King's Buildings. I generally pop in quickly for a takeaway sandwich, and have not been disappointed with the quality or the quantity of food up to now. The staff are friendly and efficient, and I can get whatever items I want in my sandwich. I just have to be careful not to let it fall apart in my hands as I eat!  The sitdown cafe looks really nice too- a nice selection of hot drinks, cakes, and soups. I will pop back to give it a try some day soon.",

    "text": "Smith's Deli is very close to our new flat, and I have to say we were very grateful to have Smith's just round the corner when we were doing the flat up and has no kitchen.  They sell lovely soup, normally lentil and another 'special' soup and of course numerous different sandwich fillings.   They also sell bacon rolls, which I am told are excellent. My other half has one at least once a week, and we bought them for some friends who came to stay. They definitely enjoyed them.  If you are in the area and need some breakfast or lunch I would definitely recommend Smith's.",

    "text": "Reading Mary S's review below, I could pretty much repeat it word for word! We moved in close to Smith's a couple of weeks ago, and it's been great - they made me a batch of much-needed coffees on our moving day, despite being in the middle of closing up, and we had delicious sandwiches the following day when our kitchen was too much of a muddle to cook. I'll definitely keep going there, it's a great wee place to have on your doorstep.",
