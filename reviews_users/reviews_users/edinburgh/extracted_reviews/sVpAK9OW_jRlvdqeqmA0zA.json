    "text": "I was looking for a vegetarian friendly Mexican restaurant, and Las Iguanas had all that and more! We arrived a bit early so we had a lovely cocktail to share at the bar. The friendly staff let us know a particular rum was out of stock, so some cocktails couldn't be made, but recommended us a cocktail that was lit on fire. Of course we went for that one, and it was delicious. We were soon guided to our table and given menus. The vegetarian choices are plenty, and so were the meaty choices. There are different types of cuisine (Brazilian, Mexican and some other), and dishes I had never even heard of. I went for a Brazilian dish and my partner in crime for fajita's. As a starter we shared the 'holy guacamole' (create your own guac) and some pasties with brie and cranberry. All the food arrived promptly, it tasted amazing and the waiter was fast, professional and friendly. We had no space for dessert so left after we had drank our beverages. I am very impressed by the quality of the food and service, and I would almost give this a 5 star review! I think my preference lies with smaller restaurants, and as Iguanas is big and works like a machine (very smoothly). That does make it feel a bit less personal as well, especially if there are groups of hen do's in the same restaurant as you! That is the only negative I can think of for this place though, and I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Been here a few times now with friends.  This is the Edinburgh branch and they have a lot of branches mainly in England.  Very simple South American restaurants with a few dishes from different countries to choose from.  I got the whole spicy Blazing Bird with slaw and sweet potato fries.  Chicken is extremely succulent and tender with enough hot habanero to give me a kick.  The great thing about Las Iguanas is that they do a 2 for 1 cocktail during happy hour.  Definitely will be back to try the other food.  Probably best South American food in Edinburgh.",

    "text": "I've now eaten here three times and it's been ok all three times. The lunch menu runs until 6.30pm and is good value with most mains at 6 to 8. Sunday to Thursday they have a selection of cocktails for 3.90.   They do all the typical Mexican food and have a good range of both vegetarian and gluten free options. They also stock gluten free beer which was a pleasant surprise for our GF member of the group.   The service can be a bit slow at times. It took an hour an half to serve two courses for three people and the restaurant wasn't full. When I went for lunch it took 10 minutes after we finished eating for the plates to be cleared. If you're not in a rush then it's fine but if you have something to get to make sure to let the staff know.   Generally fine for groups with lots of options and able to deal with large tables.",

    "text": "Cheap cocktails, decent food and a central location. Las Iguanas is ok, I've been twice, enjoyed it twice. I don't think there's anything too standout about it, but for a quick Mexican fix you could certainly do worse! If you sign up for their mailing list, you can get buy one get one free on certain items on a Tuesday. That added to 3.50 cocktails means you can have a nice dinner, dessert and drinks without breaking the bank. The thing that lets it down is the toilets, away downstairs, you need to walk through the bar to get to them. Last time I was in there was an open mic night going on in the bar and you had to walk right through the midst of it to get to the toilet, not ideal!",

    "text": "An A-OK place. Our table was HUGE so everything (apart from getting drinks mind which thankfully saved me from moaning) took forever. I think we could have been waiting near enough 45minutes to get out main meal. If you're in a smaller table you're likely to get a better experience.   Service 4* The wait staff are nice and friendly. As I said drinks were swiftly delivered.  Drinks 3* They have some great cocktail offers on although twice I tried to order a drink and they didn't have one of the main ingredients to it.  Food 4* tasty food and different to most typical Latin American places you go to. The Guac was small to share between two but delicious. An extensive menu too.  Ambience 4* nice joint. They have salsa classes downstairs on a Monday but it's right in the middle of the route to the bathroom which must be incredibly annoying for those paying for the class.   It's a cool place. A little generic in terms of decor but somewhere I'm likely to return to for lunch when I'm in town shopping.",

    "text": "I had a good meal here with the girls and would be happy to return. The tex-mex was plentiful; I had veggie enchiladas and a side of cooked plantain. Both were very tasty and I had no complaints. I had churros for pudding with the toffee sauce, which had another name but was majorly yum. If you fancy the churros I'd just go for the small portion - it was more than enough.    The space is huge. There's also a downstairs so I think it's unlikely you'd get turned away. It was really busy when I went on Saturday night, and packed with hoards of females on nights out (weird - nothing in the place makes me think it's a girly option). So it's clearly good for larger groups.",

    "text": "Las Igaunas has a lot of good things going for it, so don't be put off by my three star rating. It's certainly a place I wouldn't think twice about visiting for food and drink. It's got all the essentials covered: lots of seating available, solid food and drink, specials of drank offered most days of the week, and for me, a whole separate vegetarian menu offered at the door if you so desire one (score!). Even more so, it's a place you can take a risk on busier Friday and Saturday nights at possibly getting a seat at, even if you may have to wait a short while, which you really can't say for many places in Edinburgh.  Both times I've visited I've had decent food and drink, but I can't for the life of me remember much about my first visit at all, other than that. My second I had a shared beverage with my partner in crime which was lovely (if a bit seedy), and some pretty dern good veg fajitas. I was a little let-down with the \"make your own\" guacamole appetizer (\"Holy guacamole\" if I remember correctly), but that's only due to the extreme pampering I've had in that regard with homemade guacamole back in the states. (The portion served was a bit measly to share, TBH, but maybe that's just my American talkin'.)  Despite the lovely food, for whatever reason Las Iguanas just doesn't steal my heart away. Perhaps it's the \"chain\" vibe--perhaps it's the cut-and-dried service--perhaps it's the cost of those adult beverages (7.60!) on not-special nights. In reality, Las Iguanas is totally fine, it's just lacking in that extra \"oomph\" and personality that makes a place shine to me. Either way, I wouldn't scratch this off my list of joints in the city--I just wouldn't count it among my first picks.",

    "text": "Went back here for a Sunday boozy cocktail lunch!As I desperately want to be vegetarian I went for a Bean Burger. Oy, there's a lotta bean in that burger, a lot! It had a distinctly earthy taste what with the beetroot added to the patty and the fact it had been charred within an inch of turning into an art utensil. Since we were there for cheap cocktails, we had to indulge! We ordered a round which took a while to arrive and was then shortly followed up by another round we hadn't ordered!! How weird! We then actually ordered a second round and I can say the drinks were quite tasty. On receiving the bill one round of cocktails had been charged at full price after the manager had taken my charred main off the receipt, so luckily my sharp eyes noticed the discrepancy and there was much fluffing to get it corrected. I can say our waiter was the best thing about Las Iguanas, he was very attentive and lovely, but still looks like the restaurant has some kinks to iron out.",

The food is great and so is the ambience (typical lovely Las iguanas decorations). Their cocktail promotion from Sunday to Wednesday for 4 pounds is a plus, and their cocktails are string and tasty. The only minus is the service which is a bit slow and not that organized so far.",
