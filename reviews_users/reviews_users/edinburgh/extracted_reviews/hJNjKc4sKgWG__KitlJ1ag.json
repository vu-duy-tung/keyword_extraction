They definitely could have saved themselves the trouble and sent us on our way, so it was very much appreciated.   We ordered a pitcher of margaritas (yum). The glasses came pre-salted, so if you're not into salt with your margaritas, there's your heads up. Warn the waiter/waitress ahead of time. Or just stop being so picky!  The food was great. I can't even remember what I ordered because I was so hungry and it was so good and who knows if I even chewed because it was gone in about 2 minutes. Thus, my only complaint is the portions sizes could be bigger.",

    "text": "BEST MEXICO FOOD IN ALL OF SCOTLAND!  Okay you might ask why do I want Mexican Food in Scotland, anyway?  I first went to Viva Mexico at the ripe age of 23 as a graduate student at the University of Edinburgh.  The original Viva Mexico was down a Close (walking corridor) very close to the current location on Cockburn Street, I remember how we used to finish up our studies and head out for some Mexican beer and nachos.  I was in Edinburgh in August for the Edinburgh Festival to see Paco Pena's new Flamenco premiere, so I convinced my travel companions to join me on a trip down memory lane to an old-time favorite eatery.  I'm not sure how to describe the food, except to say that if you have had stuffed nopales in Oaxaca or the street tacos in Cancun, you will appreciate when I say that this place is AUTHENTIC.  Not a Brit's idea of what Mexican food 'might taste like' if they didn't buy everything at Tesco, but instead an authentic, home made assortment of traditional Mexican food with moles and ranchero sauces when and where you expect them.  A wonderful find, a wonderful opportunity to relive my school days, and very happy to see that the kids are now running the restaurant in its larger, more posh location.  VIVA -- Viva Mexico!!!",

However, I love the chimichangas at Viva Mexico, especially with the carnitas.  This time around it was a little dry, but it was still full of flavor and delicious.  The beans are great, but the rice could use a little more flavor.  To start, try the chips and pico de gallo.  The pico de gallo has great flavor and be warned it is very spicy, but absolutely wonderful.  The margaritas are strong, and the cerveza is ice cold.  I love the atmosphere, the staff are friendly, and every time I bring new friends, they love it!",

    "text": "I'll start off by saying that I'm an American with American standards when it comes to Mexican food. Add to that list that I'm also originally from Texas and half Mexican and boy does that make me a picky eater. :) I've yet to find any Mexican food in Scotland that has lived up to my standards but decided to give Viva Mexico a shot!   My friend and I spent the day a few weeks ago in Edinburgh touring the Castle and taking in the sights. After passing a few random cafes that served the same ol' stuff, I noticed Viva Mexico and with slight suspicion, decided to take a look at their menu. Being vegetarian, we're usually put off by loads of meaty meals, but at quick glance, we noticed a wide variety of veggie offerings and decided to try it out.   I was immediately happy to see the colourful flare the restaurant had with all Hispanic memorabilia. We were taken downstairs to the lounge area and handed menus.   We ordered Sonoras and Nachos to start and then order a veggie burrito and chick pea and potato enchiladas for our mains. I was bummed when I forgot to order rice, because in my mind, if the rice is bad, there's no hope for any other food on the plate. It was to my surprise that my meal came with rice and it was DELISH. My friend and I were amazed at the fresh ingredients, the taste of spices in each bite and the quickness at which the food was served.   To top that off, we ordered the Chili Chocolate Cheesecake! Let me just tell you that you HAVE to try this dessert. It was amazing and spicy....but not too spicy. It was a perfect combination of flavors and it was the perfect ending to an otherwise perfect Mexican meal in Scotland.   Even though the train ride to Edinburgh is 13+ pounds one way, it's so worth it knowing that Viva Mexico is there to greet us!",

    "text": "I had a bad experience at Viva Mexico in the late 90s.  At least I thought I did.  It's now lost in the mists of time and alcohol inhibited brain function. It now occurs to me this 'incident' may have been imagined.  For years, I have moaned about Edinburgh's chronic lack of decent mexican restaurants.  Often someone would pipe up that we already had one in Viva Mexico, and I would launch into a tirade about painfully average mexican fodder slopped out to the uninitiated masses who hadn't savoured the True beauty of real Aztec dining.  Recently, my friend and frequent dining partner McChan had suggested I was barking up the wrong tree and urged me to give it another crack of the whip.  I decided to take his advice, more in defiance than expectation, and book for a work meal I was organizing.  I calculated that any food related disappointment could be quickly washed away upon a sea of tequila and santa themed merriment should I be proved wrong.  The restaurant has a cheesy but effective mexican themed decor with black and white prints of the likes of Pancho Villa adorning the walls.  Split over two floors it's a wonderfully weird and idiosyncratic shape with lots of little alcoves and rooms downstairs.  Seated upstairs next to the impressively stocked bar full of different types of Tequilla we quickly made ourselves comfortable with a jug of  Margarita (16.95).  Served with Rock salt around the rim, these were amongst the best I have tasted.  The Cointreau and tequilla were expertly measured with just the right amount of fresh lime giving the drink a real vim to go with its natural kick.  Using rock salt rather than table salt is a revelation and will now enter my rules of culinary fulfillment alongside the likes of never drinking cappuccino after 11am. It really does lift the whole drink.  We were soon  brought our menus by the friendly, efficient and helpful staff. The classic way for a foodie to spot quality is in the size and scope of the menu.  The bigger the menu, the less fresh the food and the more sloppy the chef. It's a guaranteed formula.  Here the menu is small with quite a few dishes outside of the traditional mexican comfort zone of Burrito's and Fajhita's. So far so good.  For starter(pictured after a few had already been nibbled!) we ordered the deep-fried squid rings served with spicy chipotle mayonnaise dip and a wedge of lime(4.95) and a plate of cheese stuffed jalepenos with a sweet chilli sauce(4.95).  The squid was perfectly cooked and very tender in a lovely soft batter.  The chilli mayo was simply to die for.  The Chipotle has long been my favourite of the chilli family thanks to both its 8/10 Scoville heat and its very distinctive smokey flavour.  Infusing it into mayo makes a perfect blend of creamy, smokey and spicy to dip your calamari in. Lovely.  The stuffed chilli's were not in the same league.  Slightly overcooked they could have benefited for a little more cheese, I suspect some of it escaped as part of the cooking process.  The dip was once again the highlight of the dish.  Less a traditional sweet chilli sauce than a thick, spicy jam it perfectly complimented the creaminess of the cheese.  For mains we went for the Cabo Style Fish Tacos ( 11.50).  Served in traditional, small flour warps rather than the hard tortilla shells people often associate with Taco's in the UK, this dish was just terrific.  The breaded fish was perfectly cooked, fresh, and incredibly moreish.  Covered in  spicy, crunchy breadcrumbs it resembled a posh fish finger but the taste wasn't in a different league, it was in a different sport!  Adding to the flavour was a homemade cabbage coleslaw and white sauce made from yoghurt, mayo and those lovely chipotle chillies! Messy to eat, this dish is amongst the finest mexican cuisine I have tasted. My only criticism would be that the rice on the side tasted like it came straight out of a packet.  Replace it with a nice fresh side salad and the dish is a 100% winner. Fantastic. All dishes were served with homemade spicy salsa on the side at no extra cost.  It's lovely but go easy because it has a kick.  Well priced, with an average 2 course meal and a drink costing around 20, Viva Mexico is a gem.  If you can get hold of a corporate Snapfax you can enjoy 20% discount on all food and drinks which makes it even more appealing.  Value for money is matched by quality food and I can definitely see why the restaurant has lasted for 28 years at the sharp end of Auld Reekie dining. I won't be leaving another ten years between visits!",

There may be a limited choice of Mexican restaurants in Edinburgh, but this one doesn't compare to the restaurants I've been in Mexico and Texas. After eating Mexican food weekly for the last two decades, I'd have to say this is the most disappointing.",

Yes, the place is decorated like a Tijuana gift shop, but everything was so delicious, I'm willing to overlook that.  There's a pretty standard selection of yum yums: nachos, tostadas, enchiladas, chimichangas, etc.  The bar also serves up a delicious frozen strawberry margarita in addition to several mexican beers.    If you're looking for tacos that consist of pita bread filled with rice (curse you, Chiquito!!) then this may not be the mexican food for you.  But if you hail from West Coast and would shoot a baby penguin for some decent guacamole, you're in luck!",

It had been several weeks since I left the west coast of California and therefore just that much time since I had enjoyed a burrito...or even a taco.  I could feel the absence of Mexican food and it weighed upon me.  Then, one evening, as I glanced out of the window from where we were staying, I noticed the \"Viva Mexico\" sign.  \"Mexican food...in Scotland? Get the [insert expletive here] out!\" I exclaimed. I was sure it was merely travel weariness playing tricks upon me. So, we went the next evening to check out what I was sure would prove a mirage.  The \"Viva Mexico\" experience did not disappoint.  The price at first was shocking for thanks to geography, I'm accustomed to getting superb Mexican food at bargain-basement prices.  The food was was in retrospect, acceptable, but at the time the fact that it was Mexican food (extra star!) made it taste as if each dish were sprinkled with magic.  We ordered a tomato-based tortilla soup, quesadillas (they call them quesadas and in their defense, they were big), Sonora style-refried beans, and they special made some potato-chickpea flautas.  We topped these off with freshly made margaritas.  The dinner was expensive but the atmosphere was lively and the staff was both sweet and accommodating.  And, it instantly cured my culinary case of homesickness.   TIP: If you go, sit in the back.  You'll get a glorious view overlooking Waverley bridge.",

The staff are great, the decor brings all the vibrancy I expect when I think of Mexico, and the food is amazing.  During the day you can choose from their lunch menu which is surprisingly generous, offering the Sopa del Dia (soup of the day), with a choice of (chicken / beef / pork / veggie) burritios, tacos, enchiladas and chimichanga. The burritos are awesome, definitely go for them but the other stuff is really good as well.   Moving onto the evening, it is a good idea to book a table, as it fills up quickly. I was always a bit sceptical of Mexican restaurants, as I thought I could just make it myself but Ay Yay Yay!!! how wrong I was. Well I can make Mexican food but just nowhere near as good as these guys. The camerones (king prawns) in chipotle sauce are de puta madre! (lets translate that as absolutely spiffing darling), and the fajitas are pretty damn fine as well. The atmosphere is really good here, it is always vibrant and the staff are really friendly. It is pretty good value as well for the quality of the food on offer.  If all Mexican food is as bueno as this then definitely Viva Mexico!!!",

I just dropped in for a quick lunch as I heard that they had a good lunch menu, well priced and perhaps a bit different from all the other dull lunches on offer around the city centre.   I had the Tortilla soup followed by chicken enchillada. I had a cappuccino before eating.   I was blown a0way by the soup - Jamie Oliver has recently been on TV talking about how good mexican soup was and this was definitely the case, absolutely delicious.   The coffee was great too. Lots of Edinburgh eateries let themselves down by their coffee - this place does great coffee!!! I found out that the beans come freshly roasted from a specialist local coffee place.   And of course I have to compliment all of the staff (I was served by three different people throughout the meal) and they were all attentive, friendly and knowledgable.   Last but not least look out for the cool (and very traditional) model mexican market stall in the restaurant window - lots of people were taking photos while I was there.   5 * review and I will most certainly be visiting again!

Although the notion of authentic Mexican cuisine in the middle of the Scottish Capital sounds...well, a little far-fetched, wait until you've dipped some crispy calamares into a spicy chipotle mayonnaise dip and lapped it up with a chilled Modelo Especial, then the idea of authentic Mexican food in Scotland won't sound so outlandish! With some truly cracking enchiladas and equally tempting sizzling fajitas, Viva La Mexico is a sure bet for a flavour packed evening with friends and family alike. Unless your planning on dining with a large group (6 and above), in which case I would advise booking via phone, its usually possible to get a table on an adhoc basis. An average meal (Food and drink) is around 20 per head, so it shouldn't be too hard to rally some amigos, huddle around a table and savor the delights of some Mexican food that packs a flavoursome punch. Oh, and make sure you order extra re-fried beans, a trusty accompaniment for any wholesome Mexican dish!",

    "text": "I decided to celebrate my birthday at Viva Mexico based on all the good reviews it has received, over and above that of other Mexican restaurants in Edinburgh. Initially we were really impressed, the decor was fun, service was excellent and the waiter was keen to recommend some of the Mexican beers on the menu which was appreciated. My criticism is regarding a lack of attention to detail with the food, it was like there was two people in the kitchen and one of them just couldn't be bothered. Highlights of the meal were the chipotle mayo which was decidedly moreish, the fresh salsa provided at the start of the meal and my incredibly tasty mole sauce.  My brother also opted for the steak (rare) which was a big hit, really well flavoured and well cooked. The other meals though....massive disappointment and all the same complaint.  We had a slow roast pork with salsa verde chimichanga, Tacos and Enchiladas de Mole.  The meat in all of the dishes was well cooked but had no flavour whatsoever, the chicken in my enchiladas could not stand up to the mole sauce at all. The sides were similarly unappetising; refried beans which tasted like they'd been initially overcooked and then reheated and rice which was colorful but again, overcooked and bland. A big giveaway, I thought, to the malaise in the kitchen was the side salad;  tasteless and dried up. As someone who works in a kitchen it tasted as though they'd prepped it two days ago and then left it sitting out the fridge every night since then.   We didn't clear our plates and left with the food sitting heavy in our stomachs, all in all a massive let down.  I've been really interested in Mexican cookery of late and this appeared to be the most authentic place to experience it in Edinburgh.  Although there were flashes of flavour in some sauces the rest of the meal was lackluster, heavy and without any flair. I hope this complaint is the result of a temporary staffing issue and is not the new order of things at Viva Mexico.",

It was almost 9pm when I arrived with my two young children, we had been watching Flawless and even though I had to sit at the front surrounded by teenage girls and a dance group that took every possible opportunity to show off their torsos my children decided to take the last pound of flesh from me by insisting on waiting an extra hour after the show had finished so they could get their autographs! Anyway, by 9pm we were all absolutely starving and we weren't disappointed.  The food was outstanding and made me wish I didn't live so far away as I would certainly like to come here again. I ordered the shredded beef burrito but if I were to come here again then I would arrive much earlier and be far more adventurous.  It would be great to order three courses to see how good this place really is and I have already decided that I'm definitely coming back next summer!",

The salsa tastes pretty authentic (not out of a jar) which I appreciate, and their fajitas come with freshly made pico de gallo. Does cater to large groups, so don't go there if you don't like crowds. Surprisingly good food for a heavily tourist area.",

    "text": "viva mexico is one of the few mexican restaurants i had yet to try in edinburgh, so when dinner was arranged here for friday night i was looking forward to going.  i had a quick peak at the menu and was slightly disappointed that i may not be able to eat a lot of it as it's still passover and bread/grain options are off limits.  still though, margaritas were still allowed so i knew it would still be a good night!  i very carefully walked down the hill that is cockburn street in 4 inch heels to arrive at viva mexico.  from street level the restaurant looks tiny as there is on a front room to be seen.  but on entering i was instructed to head down the stairs to the back dining room which was much larger and there is a second dining room as well so loads of seats.  i definitely was digging the decor, it was super colourful and stereotypical and cheesy but i thought it suited the vibe of the restaurant.  the pinata was a nice touch and after a few jugs of margaritas we were tempted to hit it and see if there was candy inside!!  so the margaritas were awesome!!  a wee bit expensive though as a jug was about 25 or so.  this did provide about 10 small glasses of drink though, so i'm not sure what the value for money is on that... we ordered some corn tortillas and guacamole which after some googling i realised i could eat as they were gluten free and only made from corn.  in fact after that i realised that a lot of the menu was available to me and it was quite handy that they had marked all the GF items!  the guacamole was super tasty and quite garlicy, some of the best guacamole i've had in awhile.  it was quite obvious this had been made in the restaurant and not bought in which was good.  for mains i ordered the pork tostadas and this is where my three star rating comes in.  when my dish arrived it looked tasty enough (i've posted a picture), but on digging in i wasn't overly impressed.  there was no taste explosion and the pork wasn't super tender it was actually a wee bit dry.  the corn tostadas got rather soggy underneath all the pork, refried beans, salsa, and guacamole as well.  but the rice on the side was quite tasy and overall my dish was ok but not as good as other mexican i've had.  the portion was also fairly large so i only managed just over half of it.  on paying the bill we all commented that prices were a bit high for what we had gotten, which is another reason for the 3 star review.  we did pay a lot for the margaritas but mains were also a few quid pricer than any other mexican i've been to in edinburgh and not as good quality.  so i think overall i had an ok experience here and some of the food was very good, but my main was just ok.  i would go back here, but i'd probably opt for another mexican first.",

    "text": "A group of us went here for dinner here last week. All I knew of it was that it was a Mexican Restaurant on Cockburn Street, so I had no prior expectations.   When I wondered in it looked tiny but when a lovely woman showed me to our table to meet my friends I realised the place is like a rabbit warren and much bigger than it seems. We were sitting in a fairly big room downstairs, full of Mexican trinkets and seemed great fun. So far so good, but then came the problem...  When scanning the menu, everything seemed rather over priced. I was a little strapped for cash so instead of joining in on the rounds of 25 Maragrita pitchers I opted for a couple of glasses of average white wine. I also wasn't that hungry so I opted for the haggis and cheese quesadilla starter for 5 and just had it as a main. This was a mistake as it was tiny and had very little haggis in it. Although I didn't have any envy of everyone's main courses as they also seemed pretty average and not very big.   Considering you can get mini haggis quesas from Illegal Jacks for 3.50 and they are twice the size and have lots more filling, and not just haggis and cheese, I felt a little cheated.  Overall, I loved the quirky Mexican decor and the staff seemed really nice. I wouldn't mind the prices if the food was great but I thought it was barely even good.  In my opinion, for a decent quesadilla or burrito I would far rather go to Illegal Jacks on Lothian Road or Los Cardos on Leith Walk, unless Viva Mexico ups it's game.",

    "text": "It probably isnt fair for someone from the west coast of the US to rate a Mexican restaurant in Scotland...  ... but I am going to anyway.  After living in the UK for 3+ years and having constant, massive Mexican cravings, I have recently taken my Mexican Mission to Edinburgh. After searching around, Viva Mexico seemed to have some of the best reviews, so off we went! The location is dubious as it is just off the Royal Mile and makes you think it cant possibly good, but happily this is not a problem.  The ambiance is very nice, lots of lovely 'authentic' Mexican decor and the servers were very friendly. Happy to say there was a good selection of drinks, including Mexican beer, sangria, and margaritas. Sangria was very good, with the proper amount of fruit, etc.   We started with some appetizers. The boy had a set of three mini-tacos which he was very happy with. That is surprising as he is very difficult to please when it comes to Mexican. I had the ceviche, which was good, though it was a bit different than any I have had before. Unlike another reviewer, I wish the chunks of fish were bigger so I could distinguish them, and the reddish sauce sort of threw me off, but otherwise a very acceptable ceviche.   For mains the boy had a something grande and I had a shredded beef burrito. The Grande said it was supposed to come smothered in melted cheese, but didnt. Otherwise it was good, though not amazing. The burrito was good. You could tell the meat was good quality and slow-cooked, and it was fairly big.  Overall, a very acceptable Mexican experience. Definitely satisfied the cravings for a bit. Wasnt the best Mexican I have had, but very good for the UK. I am with others who say it is weird to give free salsa, but not chips. Also, overall the meal was very expensive for Mexican. Maybe we are spoiled by our American roots, as I kept thinking how I could get an amazing, massive burrito in California for $2. Though it was good, I think this would have to be only an occasional treat as the prices make it difficult to justify anything else.",

The mole enchiladas were especially fantastic and authentic, and at a great price for such a delicious sauce that is both difficult and time-consuming to make. We had them both times we came and also enjoyed the Plato Nacional variety platter of appetizers. It's rare to find such good Mexican food in the UK, and I love this place. I will be back!",

    "text": "We stopped in here for lunch on our last day in Edinburgh. The reviews on Yelp looked good, and I love great Mexican, so why not?  We ordered a pitcher of margaritas. We forgot to mention we like it on the rocks, so they were with crushed ice instead of ice cubes. The flavor was alright. More lemony than I'm used to my margaritas being, but not terrible enough to not drink them!  For lunch, we split an order of Haggis nachos (not traditionally Mexican, but sometimes you have to try the fusion) with a side of the extra hot salsa. For our mains, I had the chile verde pork Chimichanga and the other half had the beef Enchiladas.  How was the food? Yeah it was good. Not great, but good. The nachos were tasty, but the extra hot salsa was barely medium in my book. Good flavor, but far from the \"extra hot\" the menu was claiming it to be. The mains were alright too. The beef was better than the pork (in my opinion) and I used the rest of the extra hot salsa to spice up my Chimichanga a bit.  Overall, it was decent Mexican (considering it's in the UK, where a lot of stuff is terrible). I would have preferred it hotter. Given the national dish of the UK is curry (or so some claim), I would expect that people here would like their Mexican a bit hotter. Unfortunately, the waitress claims that people really don't want any spice in their Mexican at all. Maybe these are the people who order Korma at the curry house. I don't know.  I'd probably go back if I were in Edinburgh, and I were with people who wanted to go. The lunch prices were fantastic (5.75 for the mains, and about 4.50 for the nachos we split), and the food was decent. However, if this is the best Mexican in Edinburgh as some of the other reviews claim, then Edinburgh is in dire need of something better.",

We were sat downstairs and I loved the colourful decor and pictures in Viva Mexico which I would give 5 stars to. Our several jugs of margaritas went down really well and although, there was quite a bit of ice in them watering them down, they hit the spot for me.   The corn chips and dips to start with were great and I could really taste the freshness of the guacamole. For my main, I had Enchiladas de mole - shredded chicken in wraps with chocolate sauce, refried beans and mexican rice. I asked for cheese inside the wraps too - wasn't sure if it would go well with the chocolate but I really wanted cheese which they were happy to do. When my meal arrived there was a healthy spread of chocolate on top of my enchiladas and I was excited to try this out. However I'm glad I asked for cheese as I couldn't taste the chocolate at all - I expected a nutella kind of flavour. The chicken was moist and delicious but the tastiest thing on my plate ended up being the mexican rice. I'd need to try other Mexicans to know if this is how general Mexican flavouring goes.   Overall the meal satisfed our hungry bellies however we felt it was quite pricey for what we had.",

Only on special occassions really, and even then, I'm uncomfortable spending that much money.   And that's Viva Mexico.   When I arrived on Thanksgiving Day I wanted a special meal to remember all of the important historical American facts about Thanksgiving and I thought Mexican was a pretty decent cuisine to eat considering we annexed most of their country in the past and there's not much American Indian dining to be had in Scotland (or anywhere for that matter). Mexican it was.   Oh and it was damn goooooood. It tasted like sweet, sweet colonozation.   Sangria went right to my head. Beans and rice, cooked just right. Warm tortilla chips and a prawn/shrimp filled plate. I was full and happy... and then I ordered the Chili Cheesecake and I was having inappropriately romantic feelings toward Viva Mexico.  Then I got the bill. And It was 80 dollars. That's 55 pounds. That's a f*cking lot for Mexican food, of any sort, even the best sort. It is, in effect, beans, rice, cheese, tortillas and ground meat (the guacamole and sour cream are extra). I know how much that stuff costs. And it's not visa prices for your staff because as I could see... there was only one Mexican guy (if he's even really Mexican, he just spoke Mexican Spanish).   There were no gold specks in my food and they didn't give me a foot massage or even a hot menthol towel at the end... and if I am going to spend my student-y 55 pounds, I want orgasmic piles of food and three days worth of leftovers or some sort of Mariachi band and Spanish Fly.   Here's a tip: Free tortilla chips and salsa are f*cking MANDATORY for a good Mexican food experience. I'm not talking take away burritos (that's a horse of a different color) but if my ass is going to sit down and spend 55 pounds - gimme free chips like they would in real Mexico (I think).",

I must say that the prices are high for mexican food and I am not used to that. The spiceness was not really rich and food was decent to quite good , but not special at all. I happened to see the cooks inside the kitchens and they were british-looking youngsters.   The starters mix was pretty good buy costed 1 pound per small bite! The mains were nice, but half filled with salad (75% shredded letuce, and ocassionally a cucumber slice, peas, and cheap grocery things) Not even a piece of  jalapeno or a chili pepper. On the other hand, the steak and chicken were great and the sauces were very good (but not very spicy despite I ordered a medium not mild spiceness).   The waiters and their service was excellent, and the Sangria pitches was very nice. The room (floor down) was smally giving a quite atmosphere and the lights were dim and golden. It was very comfortable and warm, so the experience was very good.  All in all it is an OK Mexican restaurant, and you would get a mexican type of food, but it failed to impress me compared to the mexican restaurants I am used to. I would give it another try in the future.",

But listen, I lived in California, L.A. to be exact, for a year AND my best friend is Mexican AND I dined at their grandparents ranch. So I know Mexican food, right? Not even close? Deal with it.  I LOVED IT. But man, I'm with Steph D. on this, it is expensive. I won't compare it to regular U.S.A. prices since their food is ridiculously cheap, but no student can afford this more than once in a blue moon. Mains are above 10pound easy, and starters are around 6-7, with a drink, that's well above my weekly budget for going out.  That being said, I had a killer Margarita here with rock salt, I know, I know, rock salt (forgive me Jenny!) but I love it so. I know it's bad and I'm trying to kick the habit, but it tastes so goooooood.  Right, on to the refried beans: I want to bathe in them. Now it is a well-known fact that when I'm slightly tipsy, everything tastes good. But usually, I'm not much of a fan of refriend beans, but these little buggers just hugged my stomach until it felt so warm and fuzzy, I could've been a damn Telletubbie (sp?).  Dear me, was it good. Oh do I want to go back, but not unless someone else is footing the bill, I can't afford it. So I think I'll just play matchstick girl outside for a while until someone takes pitty on me and gives me their leftovers. I've been practicing on my Puss-in-Boots sad-eyes.",

    "text": "It was a rainy Saturday evening during the Fringe and we needed to find somewhere to eat. We phoned around a couple of places we had been before who all said they were fully booked or weren't taking bookings, you had to show up and wait for at least half an hour. I checked yelp and read the reviews for this place so decided it was worth a try. I'm so glad we did.  When we arrived we were told that they would put us on the waiting list and we'd need to come back in half an hour as there wasn't room to wait - we pretty much expected this so went elsewhere for a drink and came back. The place was heaving (as I said - Saturday night during the Fringe) but we were seated as soon as we came back - the place is huge downstairs.   Our order was taken quickly and within about ten minutes I was presented with an awesome veggie chimichanga and a small jug of frozen strawberry margarita with a gorgeous mojito and tostadas for the boyfriend. The margarita was lovely although not the best I've tasted but the food was gorgeous. It was a really good portion size (I'm pretty greedy) and we didn't need the salsa that we'd been given on arrival as the food was perfect.   We were pretty full but as I have a second belly just for dessert I opted for the chocolate chili cheesecake. It was pretty rich and had just enough bite to slightly make the back of my throat burn a bit - lovely!   The staff were friendly but obviously run off their feet and although it was pretty noisy there was a nice atmosphere. The decoration looks as though whenever the owners see anything slightly Mexican-looking they buy it and throw it in there. This means there's plenty to look at and the place feels really relaxed.   We loved it so much we went back a few days later, my burrito was gorgeous as was the boyfriend's lemon cheesecake (which I had to test so I could review it obviously), If we didn't have a show to go to I'd have happily sat and had a few more jugs of margarita and don't think I'd have been ushered out.   The only things I'd change is that they bring your drinks just after your food rather than when you're waiting for it and the jugs of margarita are quite expensive for the size.  That said, this is now my favourite place in Edinburgh and I'll definitely be back next time we're there - I just wish they'd open one up in my home town!",

Well worth booking a table in advance as it can get busy, however, I have also gone in on a whim and been accommodated. Pleasant waiting staff who are happy to chat and make recommendations.  Nice bright decor and general pleasing aesthetic really add to the ambience. A lovely place to spend a relaxing evening. Food was delicious and a good portion size, it was also inexpensive despite it's central location. I particularly recommend their refried beans and guacamole  delicious accompaniments. Nice variety of drinks  both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. Highly recommended",

    "text": "4.5 from me.   As someone who has grown up on the Arizona/Mexico border, I would say I'm a pretty good judge of Mexican food, and Viva Mexico is pretty darn good considering how far from Mexico they are.   I stumbled upon this place on a Friday night and had fairly low expectations (so far Mexican food in England has been dire). I was really presently surprised. The margaritas were delicious and authentic, the guacamole was fresh and the pico de gallo was very good. Had the fish tacos which were not quite the same as traditional baja fish tacos (different batter) but it came with a lovely chipotle sauce, cabbage and some very tasty refried beans.   The restaurant itself was really cute. Very funky, fun Mexican decor with an eclectic mix of music. The staff was really friendly and the place had a fun, vibrant atmosphere. I would definitely recommend this place!",

Despite being a nice enough looking Mexican in a great location, this place goes to support the theory that it's hard to find decent reliable food in the touristy vicinity of the royal mile.  So disappointing to find both our shared starter of chicken nachos and our mains of pork burrito and chicken fajitas tasteless and honestly substandard to something I could have rustled up myself from an old El Paso dinner kit in the flavour stakes.  The presentation was pretty (1 star) and the staff friendly & efficient (2 stars) and so the only ingredient missing was - well - the ingredients! Won't be returning!",

And we were,luck to have been. Food was great, service fast and friendly.  Margaritas were good...as the menu says, they are not sweet....on the bitter side...very traditional and fresh... I like them very much.  Food was good all around. Quite flavorful, meat fresh and moist.  We all enjoyed, kid friendly so that was nice.  Portions for kids a pretty good size.  I would highly recommend. I give it a 4, just because we like our Mexican food being from the states and have good points of comparison.  I would this locally...this ranks as a 5/5 in the Mexican category....",

The big windows decorations just scream to come in and try a Mojito. Oh yeah. There is not much space upstairs. A few tables utmost. There are no table cloths, but the wooden tables match the rustic mexican interior with its yellow walls. I like it.   It was Halloween, so the waitresses made efforts to dress up in scary costumes.  I ordered the Mojito, which came in a small glass with large ice cubes. Hmmm, not enough Mojito and largest ice cubes ever, such a no no.  The burritos came with beef, rice and various mexican typical sauces . I missed the proper spices for my taste buds.

The menu is good and everything looked tasty but the food was very pricey. Mains were around 13-14 which for a burrito is a bit much, especially once you order starters/drinks.   The main issue was that we waited a LONG time for our food. We were a group of 9, but it took well over an hour to come. This meant several rounds of drinks before even getting starters and lots of rumbly tummies round the table.   When the food eventually came some of our order had got mixed up, though they did sort this out relatively quickly. The food was tasty, and we pretty much inhaled it after the wait (hence the lack of picture).   After our mammoth wait for the overpriced food they also added on a service charge, which was rather cheeky I thought. The restaurant itself had a pretty view out to Princes St and the Balmoral, this was probably it's highlight.   Overall I probably wouldn't recommend this place.",

We did also try Micheleda for the first time and would thoroughly recommend this beer based cocktail.   My chicken tacos were delicious and came with rice and super tasty refried beans. My partner had a chimichanga which was also hit the spot. I think the only let down were the starters, the nachos felt a bit lacklustre so could perhaps do with some sour cream / guacamole so this is where the star was lost for me.

Service was painfully slow, and it didn't seem to be particularly busy to warrant the length of time it seemed to take to get anything from a glass of water to a meal (ok, meals I am ok with on the timescale, things have to be made, not reheated).   The tortilla soup was standout for me - first time I've tried it, and i was ablet o get past my own personal yuk factor of corn chips in soup (much much better than I thought it would be). I followed it up with the potato and chickpea burritto - I haven't had a burrito since leaving the States, and this was disappointing in comparison. Not awful, but the potato had an oddly runny consistency that made the meal slightly unpleasantly odd. The boy, an ardent Mexican fan, just looked disappointed. I wished I had stuck with the fajitas.   I really wanted to like Viva Mexico, hoping that it would have brought a little injection of Mexican sunshine into a wintery Edinburgh, but I was left wanting overall.",

My rice felt undercooked and the baja fish burrito was pretty plain, alone on a plate with a little rice. It was just okay. Fish was kind of dry. I came back again a couple months later hesitantly and ordered the same thing. And wow! It was COMPLETELY different. It had far more filling, more sides (a salad and rice and I think beans, if I remember correctly; first time it was essentially a plain burrito alone on a plate), and actually tasted really good! I've come back another two times since. I'm wondering if they maybe changed some of their menu items due to criticism? If you've gone in the past and not enjoyed it, I would definitely say it's worth another try now. Probably best Mexican I've tried in Edinburgh. Also our server was really nice, and they were able to make a lot of substitutions for our table full of vegetarians and lactose intolerant people. It's far better than it once was. Great taste for a pretty good price!",

It also has the required cheesy Tex-Mex ambience factor and it's a convenient Royal Mile location.   Now, me? I am from California. As pasty as I look, I am half hispanic. I can make pretty much anything on the menu if they sold the dang ingredients anywhere convenient in the UK for a reasonable price (mission impossible!)... so you can guess where this is headed. To me, this is watered down Tex-Mex faire. To an American reader, I would liken this to something you might find in the midwest or a strip mall somewhere... not horrible, but not exactly good. Definitely nowhere in the neighborhood of authentic. Not even a distant cousin of authentic. And *so* not worth the price....UNLESS you are stranded in Scotland and craving something resembling Mexican food and this will do. Particularly, I have to say the sangria really let me down. I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about. Insert Mexican sad-face here. It impressed the man, who'd never had it before... but I found it to be not so bueno.   Anyhow.. the bill came, it was pretty large for what would have been about 30% of that in the states (and tasted 300% better) but the man was thrilled with the experience so it wasn't a total loss.",

    "text": "Pay heed to the previous reviews - the servings at Viva Mexico are SMALL!  Other than that, I was pretty impressed by Viva Mexico.  Upstairs was busy, but there's a good sized area down the stairs, which has windows onto the back of the close, not dark and dingy at all like I was expecting. And the entire time we were there they played Bob Dylan, marvellous!  Lunch time meant that we had a slightly more limited menu to choose from, but there was still enough to satisfy me and my vegan friend.  I had the beef enchiladas, my friend had the vegetable fajitas (minus the sour cream and cheese, obviously). Enchiladas are something I really enjoy, but hadn't ordered in a restaurant since the time in Amsterdam where the woman at the table next to me threw up all over the table.... But rest assured, these enchiladas were very nice and not at all vomit-worthy (not that the Amsterdam ones had been either mind). And my friend was suitably impressed by how many peppers were in her fajita mix, as she's a bit of an onion hater.  But, like I said, the portions were small. They weren't remotely spicy either, but that bothered me less, and I enjoyed the rice that was served with them too.  My enchiladas did only cost me 5.95, so I wasn't expecting anything huge for that price, but given you can get monster-sized burritos elsewhere in Edinburgh for the same price, Viva Mexico really do need to work on the portion sized.  Oh, and as others have said, what's with the lonely salsa?!  Still, I enjoyed my lunch. I was still hungry at the end of it, otherwise there'd have been a 4th star, but what I did eat was pretty tasty.",

I wonder if the owners are from Mexico or Spain, because the food was anything but Mexican, or maybe because we come from a place where we can find very decent and good Mexican food. The waiter was no friendly at all and very slow, he did no understand that we just wanted to drink water, and no alcohol or sodas, I think that upset him, it's pretty common in US and in London to drink water in restaurants without any problem. Anyways, I hope the owners of this place read this review, they need to put order with their employees and try better with their food. I ordered for a pollo asado and they gave me pretty much chicken nuggets and rice, my sister ordered for chicken quesadillas and they gave her 2 pieces of pita bread and boiled chicken. At the end we wish we never went there.",

This restaurant serves the closest thing to authentic Mexican food I have experienced in Europe. My wife ordered the Chicken Fajitas cooked fresh and served with flour tortillas. She said they were very delicious. I ordered the beef enchiladas lunch special that was served with rice and tortilla soup. The enchiladas were tasty, however I think they were prepackaged and microwaved before served. The soup was delicious and was topped with sliced avocado. They only thing that would make this dining experience more authentic is if they served complimentary tortillas chips and salsa as you were seated. #edinburghmexicanfood #edinburghmexicanrestaurants",

The soup came out as an appetizer and it was good; very spicy, had literal tortilla chips (not the strips) but I liked it and it was filling! They wait for you to finish your appetizer before bringing the main out. While there are only two taquitos with the lunch portion, it comes with a side salad and rice. The taquitos were SO GOOD. So much so that I'm sitting in the airport at 5am right now craving them. I was worried that two wouldn't be enough but again, the soup was very filling, and coupled with the sides I left satiated. I washed everything down with a couple of gold margaritas. I wish I had time to return and sample more; they are not quite authentic but they do hit the spot!",

They brought me downstairs to the most adorable and semi-empty room and gave me a menu. I ordered some sort of chicken tostada meal -- the \"cheese\" part drew me in. I also ordered a cup of tea. It was basic tea but there's nothing better than tea on a cold night!  When my plate arrived, the portion was massive. Way more than one person could eat. I overheard the folks at the table next to me say the same thing when they couldn't finish their meals. Now, the food was okay, don't get me wrong, but the tortilla was a bit overcooked and the chicken was dry. I didn't taste much cheese either. My rice accompaniment was crunchy like it needed to be cooked longer.  If not for the welcoming atmosphere, this would probably be a 2-star review. If I lived in the area, I'd try something else but from the other reviews, it looks like my experience was typical unfortunately. Scotland is rather far from Mexico.",

These were fried in house but didn't come out warm and must have been done earlier. They were still pretty good although unlike in the US there was a charge for the tortilla chips rather than complimentary as many places in the states provide.   Chicken fajitas were nice ( I tried my friends) but there are better things on the menu that are tastier.  I had the shredded beef chimichanga with refried beans and rice. It was good and I'd recommend it at 13.50 as very reasonable for central Edinburgh. My other friend had the chicken burrito with black mole sauce. I tried the mole sauce and it was good although pretty sweet an I didn't get much more than sweet chocolate coming through. I'd personally get it on the side but if you have a sweet tooth go for it.   All in all very good and I would definitely come back again.",

    "text": "My disclaimer: I'm biased when it comes to Mexican food thanks to growing up cooking and eating the home cooked variety as well as being surrounded on the West Coast by fantastic Mexican restaurants.  That being said, this place was decent.  I have to give it some credit as I wouldn't expect actual authentic Mexican food in Scotland.  Tired of the pub fare, I decided to try this place with my husband.  The menu looked promising as well as their drink selection.  I had a strawberry Margarita and their chicken enchiladas.  My husband had their fish and rice dish with a local beer and then a shot of tequila.  For a starter we had guacamole and salsa with chips.  The guac wasn't bad at all and generous, considering the avocados have to be imported. Their salsa had a nice amount of kick.  The chips tasted a bit soggy, however.    When we got our main dishes, I found the enchiladas were okay.  The jalapenos helped give it some spice while the refried beans were tasty.  The rice I had had a bit of an issue with as it was undercooked (needed about two more minutes).  The flavor was good despite being a bit crunchy to eat.  My husband seemed to enjoy his fish and rice.  For dessert, besides flan, don't expect the dessert menu to be ethnically correct.  I had went for their caramel apple pie and ice cream while my husband had their chilli chocolate pie.  Both were delicious but not authentically Mexican.  What I do give them merit on is effort.  The interior is joyfully decorated with Gods Eyes, pinatas, and pictures of famous Mexicans (i.e: Emilio Zapata).  The walls are colorful and vibrant while the tables have fun placemats and paper flowers.  The food gives a Scotsman's nod to the Mexican culture and tries its best to offer an authentic taste.  Can't beat down the gringos for trying in this corner of the world.",

    "text": "So we'd been in the British Isles for over two weeks, having more than our share of fish and chips, shepards pies, and hamburgers. By night number sixteen, who wouldn't want... Mexican food?  Well, we certainly weren't going to pass up on the idea, if for nothing else than the irony. It was located just a few blocks from our hotel, and there wasn't anything else ringing our proverbial bell, so we acquiesced. The night was cool, with a layer of fog enveloping us, setting the mood to be more London than Tijuana. Nonetheless, we were greeted by their sign in front which advertised \"With Real Mexicans\" (In your face, Donald Trump!).  We were asked if we had reservations. While we did not, we were quickly seated anyway, by a white woman. We witnessed to other gringo employees, with nary a Mexican in sight. We should've sued for False advertising. As it was, I had to have a shot and a beer or I was going to fill completely unfulfilled. To soften the load on me tummy, I had a fish burrito, and I'm happy to report that I did not get sick that evening. Wife also enjoyed the meal, but pointed out that the meal really wasn't authentic Mexican.  As we were in a festive mood, we elected to have dessert - for me it was a chili chocolate pie, expecting it to make me yell out \"DYNOMITE\". It didn't quite have that effect, but it was sweet enough.   So, if you're looking for something unexpected, Viva Mexico certainly fits the bill. And if you're looking for something that'll fill you for a not unreasonable price that tastes decent, it will also work. Just don't expect it to be like something you'd get in San Francisco's Mission District. For that, you have to go to San Francisco's Mission District.",

We were seated in the basement and the service was pretty slow, not sure if they forgot us a few times. I ended up feeling quite sick from whatever I did intake - was not a fun experience at all. The table legs were uneven and the table surface was sticky - not a good look guys, not at all.",
