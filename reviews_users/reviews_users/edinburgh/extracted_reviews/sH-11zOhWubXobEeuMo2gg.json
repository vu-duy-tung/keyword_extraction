For the next three days we kept stopping by after closing =(  Finally on our last day we made it. It seems they prepare one pig and when it's gone it's gone. And by that I mean there is a cooked pig in the window. Some are turned off by this sight. Do not be frightened by the pig he can't hurt you.   We each had a sandwich with haggis and apple spread. Couldn't have asked for a better meal. Don't let the name or the ingredients give you the wrong idea, haggis is delicious! How I wish we had been able to eat here everyday.",

We were up in Edinburgh for the fringe festival and there are so many choices for fast and on the go food to maximise your time at shows and this is definitely the place to hit up.  My Yelp app is definitely my fave travel companion!    My bf and I decided to share the larger sandwich on a white bun with stuffing and mild chili sauce.  It was oinktastic!  It would be dangerous if there was a place like this in London 'cuz I would probably go there weekly.  I'll definitely be back when I am next in Edinburgh.",

You get three sizes, depending on your hunger, starting 2.95 to 4.95 - so price is incredible for what you get! The bun - yep, then either haggis (come on you're in scotland!) or sage stuffing then the sauce apple or a chilli sauce then the pulled pork and ask for the crackling - OMG yum. Seriously was in edinburgh for 6 days, almost ate one of these a day! so good, good value. If you're lucky will get a seat, but generally its eat on the go or pray its not raining (unlikely, you are in scotland) and you can head ot the grassmarket and sit and eat outside. Overall, this is a must stop when in edinburgh!",

The roasted pig in the front window is no gimmick - that's the actual porker they started roasting that morning - and when it's consumed that's it for the day. That's BBQ at it's purest!  The portions are ample, but unless you're not very hungry I'd still recommend ordering at least the \"Oink\" size. The \"Piglet\", while adorable, really isn't enough meat for any self-respecting carnivore.  I tried the brown roll, sage and onion stuffing and chili relish on my first try, and I have to say it was heaven. My next visit will probably involve haggis and some crackling, so I'll report back then.",

    "text": "Oh, Oink. Sweet, sweet Oink. This tiny place is nestled amongst the various shops and boutiques of Victoria Street. It can get hot and crowded inside, with only one table for dining-in, but the service is so quick and efficient that you can be in and out with a piping hot sandwich in just a few minutes. Make sure to bring cash, since they don't accept credit cards.  They sell two things: pork sandwiches and drinks. But let me tell you, these are no ordinary sandwiches. Every day they serve their pulled meat from one pig, and one pig only. You can see it sitting there through the window, head and all. It's pretty unique, and you know it's incredibly fresh.  There are three sizes: Piglet, Oink, and Grunter. The Oink is probably the best deal, 3.60 for 160g of meat, though the Piglet is ideal for a tasty snack. I saw someone order the Grunter, and though it looked way too huge for me, it looks like it suits a big appetite perfectly. Each one comes overflowing with juicy pork meat. You can choose your roll, toppings, and sauce as well. Grab an Irn-Bru to go, and you're all set. I've had an Oink with BBQ sauce on a white roll and loved it so much I stopped by for another with apple. Both were outstandingly delicious.  If in Edinburgh, make sure to visit Oink. It usually closes quite early in the afternoon, when the meat runs out, so stop in before it's all gone!",

Don't give me your excuses that you're too busy or you're strapped for cash, it's a fiver and you're never too busy for this sort of food. Never.   Oink is a small takeaway joint on the Grassmarket that sells, you may have guessed it, pork. A whole lot of pulled pork. On a roll. Once you go on, there's 3 steps to ordering. Choose your size, Piglet (small), Oink (medium) or Grunter (large). You then choose your filling on the white or brown roll from sage & onion and haggis, and finally choose your sauce, where you can choose from BBQ, chilli cheese or apple. And you can also top it with crispy crackling if you want. Doesn't that sound heavenly? It is.   Today I went for a Grunter with sage and onion and chilli cheese sauce. Ugh, absolutely to die for. I didn't actually notice at the time you could order crackling on it, only through reading other reviews, which I'm slightly saddened by as I love crackling. Oh well, just another reason to be heading back here soon! At only 4.60 for their most expensive option, how could you ever say no?",

    "text": "I'm not normally a fan of pork, given the choice in a restaurant I'll usually go for another meat first but this is deliciously different.  Oink is different, it's a tiny little cafe on Victoria Street, surrounded by (mostly) high quality shops and restaurants.  They sell one thing :  Hog Roast rolls.  Take one pig, roast it, stick it in the window (head and all), keep selling it on rolls until the little piggy is gone and then close the shop.  Pulled roast hog served on a brown or white roll in small, medium or large sizes, with a choice of Haggis, Sage & Onion stuffing, apple sauce or chilli sauce (all for under 5).  If you get there early enough there might be crackling still available too, if you get there too late they could be closed.  They also sell tea, coffee, hot chocolate & cold drinks and occasionally soup.  Sounds simple and it is, but it is gorgeous! You'll be licking your fingers and mopping the juice off your chin by the end, if you're anything like me, it can get a little messy as the juices turn the roll soggy :-) . I personally go for the Haggis & chilli with crackling if available.  The cafe itself is small and fairly basic, I normally take mine (wrapped in tinfoil) down to the Grassmarket and stuff my face on a bench.  They also have an outdoor catering van which you'll find at the Edinburgh Farmers Market every Saturday morning on Castle Terrace, which serves exactly the same thing. A great option for brunch while you do some shopping.",

The bread they use at Oink is the perfect juice soaking fluffy goodness a pig could meet. (hey, I wasn't talking about me!)  BTW, seating is quite limited. I recommend finding somewhere to sit either inside or down the street before eating lest you might lose bits of glorious meat down your shirt and that would be a shame.",

The meat is super flavorful and juicy. The amount of sauce was minimal and not spicy at all, and I think having the bread toasted would've made it perfect.

Sage and onion or haggis are stuffing options, along with you choice of sauce such as apple sauce, mustards, I had chilli cheese. My arteries hardened the minute I walked out of that place, but my mouth is watering just thinking about it, oh my god just go there!!

The pulled pork I found to be a bit bland, but maybe that sort of plain-ness is normal.  It is, however, supplemented by incredibly flavorful fillings and toppings, and the meat is basically just a medium for all that goodness.  Definitely ask for some crackling if you're a fan.",

There was so much meat in the sandwich though; I wish there were more sauce and more vegetables! The pork was pretty good and flavorful, although I think my sandwich was too big. Towards the end of eating it, I no longer wanted to eat it because there was too much meat! Good place to try out though.",

Their oven is custom made and fits up to 20 pigs which are monitored the entire time they're cooked (12 hours).  These guys sling up to 1500 sandwiches a day during busy festivals. They also cater large parties and weddings. BBQ sauce was added a few years ago mostly due to the demands of Uhmerricins. Before then they were so proud of the product they wouldn't allow it.  The guy behind the counter (round salt n peppa head) explained it all to me at the end of a long day. His buddy (ginger) was nice and helpful as well. True gentlemen. The pork was amazing.

I lived next to the market where the Oink hog was marched to on a saturday, in the days before their shop opened on Victoria Street, and I would be lying if I said I wasn't captivated by its piggy mystique. Maybe it awakens a hunter gatherer impulse within us - or maybe we have seen too many episodes of Lost - but, for some reason, the sight of an entire dead pig (think apple in the mouth) gives an incredible and inexplicable urge of \"I want that inside me\".  I'm afraid, however, that the reality is that it tastes OK and not much better than OK. Once you get over the fact that the butcher has just done slightly less work on your lunch and that you are not in fact standing in the wilderness, but on a street which has become reminiscent of a building site, this piggy mystique begins to vanish.  To put this another way, imagine a Yelp friend proclaiming the latest city lunch craze city to be a kebab shop with an entire skinned lamb revolving slowly in front of a small radiator, head, legs and all. You may begin to be willing to reappraise your dining priorities.   In short, it's tasty enough, but lets not go over board here people. How often would you choose a pork sandwich when given a choice? Just imagine they kept the ingredients in the kitchen, like everyone does.",

The reaction, however, is the same- glee; pure, unadulterated glee. The first time I walked past this place I quite literally shoved my head against the window and stared at the glistening roast hog for at least 75 seconds. Then I stared at the people who worked there for a little while, in a poor orphan Annie kind of way, in the vain hope that they would throw me some scraps of crackling. Then my friend made me leave. BUT THEN I returned one other day, and realised I'd found my spiritual home. I'm not allowed wheat so asked for just meat and sauce, no roll, and that is what I got- a big pile of juicy meat, some crackling and some delicious sauce. Now my friend got a roll, and it looked pretty good, and she made noises which I don't think anyone has ever been able to extract from her before, so delicious did she find the sweet sweet meaty goodness enveloped inside her bap. All in all, this place is amazing, albeit terrible for my arteries.",

It was one of the first things he mentioned after we got off the train at Waverly Station, and it kept creeping into conversation as the days in Edinburgh swept on by.  We finally had a chance to give it a try the day before we were set to leave for Prague. We each got the \"The Oink\" - which is a regular-sized version of the sandwich. I chose to dress my brown roll with sage and onion and the chili relish, while my husband chose the apple sauce and chili relish on a white roll.  They are cash only, and their \"dining room\" is almost non-existent, so if they're busy, you may have to take your sandwich to go. As it was, the one table by the window was taken, and the one bar area (with four chairs) was also taken. We were just discussing where we could go to eat when the guys at the bar offered us their seats, as they were finishing up.  The sandwich was good, but I wasn't blown away by it. I guess I had built it up in my head so much over the months - we talked about it, we drooled over the pictures - so I was expecting it to knock me on my bum.  It was decent, and it filled me up. Plus, it was by far the cheapest meal we had on the entire trip, so that has to count for something.",

Hog roast/pulled pork the way it should be done. They have the whole hog they roasted and pull from in the window. It's locally sourced from a farm outside of the city, which I am pretty sure belongs to the owners. They know pigs.  I got a Grunter (the largest size), with haggis as a topping (because it was delicious and only the good die young), and tried a few of their creatively made sauces. You can get two smaller sizes, and other toppings are available. They also have sandwiches to go if you are in a hurry. The bread holds, bites, and chews with the best of them, but the highlight is obviously that sweet sweet pig. Here's the kicker: It's super affordable...  Go to it. Seriously. Get up, get a Grunter, waddle off the food baby on the royal mile, then go to the grassmarket and get your second. 5 stars well deserved.",

    "text": "We were heading to collect our torches for the torch parade - with only minutes left on our parking meter.  We were speed walking up Victoria street and caught a glimpse of Oink.  It was after 3pm. There was a line.  There didn't appear to  be much left.  It only took a second to hatch a brilliant plan:  I would go for the torches while my husband would get in the line a grab a couple of pulled pork rolls.  It wouldn't take any extra time and we could still get back to the car before the hi-vis clad parking attendants pounced.  the outcome???  I grabbed the torches and jogged back to Oink.  Just as I neared Oink I saw them putting a 'Sold Out' sign on the door.  I looked around and couldn't find my other half.  Was he successful?  Did he get some rolls?  Ahh....there he was, coming up the road and what did I see?  2 foil wrapped rolls in his hands.  Success!    We made a bee-line back to the car  where we were able to take a few minutes and tuck into our little parcels of delight.  These really are the best pulled pork rolls I've ever had.  The meat is soooooo tender. It's 'pulled' but not too stringy - there are big, flaky chunks to sink your teeth in.  And the juices are savory, delicate, and compliment the meat perfectly.  You can get bbq sauce on top but I prefer au naturale.  In fact, I don't like it when some places cook the pork in a barbecue sauce - too over powering for me.  A brown roll and a little applesauce were my perfect combination.    Pictures?  Not this time.  They didn't last long enough!  But don't worry - we'll be back!!",

The bread roll was soft and the savory haggis with chili relish was the perfect spread to compliment the pork. I had the middle-sized Oink roll, which was a good portion for lunch. When the man offers you the crispy crackling, don't turn him down. The crackling (crispy pork skin) was the best part! If you're a hog fan, Oink is a great place to stop by for a bite without hurting your wallet.",

Their simple menu lacks variety, but more than makes up for it in quality.  You can make your own sandwich- size, bread, meat/topping, and sauce selections.   I was really hungry after going on a long walking for of Edinburgh, and I needed something quick. Oink was perfect for that. I ordered my sandwich and had it in my hand in less than 5 minutes.  Recommend for lunch in a busy day. You won't regret going to this great sandwich joint",

    "text": "Walking through the streets of Edinburgh on our way to Holyrood, my new husband and I casually looked through a window to see a fully cooked pig, half of it's body pulled apart into glorious, tender looking pulled pork. Even though we had already eaten (an a stinky lunch at that), who can resist pork that looked as good as that? No one I tell you. No. One.   There are a couple different size options, filling options, and sauce options. We had it twice in our trip and pretty much tried everything. I would suggest getting two small sammies, one with the sage stuffing and one with the haggis stuffing as both are great. There barbecue sauce is pretty darn amazing and the price is totally worth it. For a small place, they sure do a lot of business and that shows how good the food is. Definitely worth it to stop in, especially while wandering around Edinburgh!",

Today was the day when I told that guilt to just get lost and let me enjoy a delicious roll. I'm so glad I eventually let the meat eating side of me wine. Oink certainly lives up to the hype. I went for the Oink with haggis. I ended up avoiding the relish, as I am a picky one and wasn't sure what to expect from them. The meat itself was just wonderful. There is always a worry that pork will be a quite dry but not with Oink. There is a larger option available but personally 'The Oink' was big enough for me. Go along and let your meat eating side win!",

Obviously, I ordered the Grunter - the largest hog roast sandwich offered. The real dilemma came when choosing a base and a sauce. The server recommended the sage and onion layer, so I went with that. I asked that he put the apple and chili sauce in small cups so that I could try the sandwich sauceless, with the sweet apple sauce, and chili sauce.  All three combinations were great. The sandwich was excellent on its own. The apple sauce added an interesting element of sweetness while the chili sauce added an element of tanginess.   The most memorable part of the experience is seeing the hog in the storefront.",

(To be fair, I think I've ruined my taste buds with hot sauce and chillis over the years.)    I've actually been past a few times and wanted to pop in, but it was always after they had run out... while normally this irritates me, the potential for irregular hours, I get it at this place... as others have mentioned, whole pig in the window is what they do, when it's gone it's gone for the day.  I was really hoping that Oink would change my mind for these type of sandwiches, it looked fantastic, even though I creep myself out thinking \"that crispy skin looks tasty\", but it is what it is, and I've heard many good things about the place.  I had the medium sized sandwich with haggis and the spicy cheese sauce... while good, and definitely on par with similar places, it still didn't rock my world.  (Trust me, I feel terribly bad about this... I spend time pondering what must be wrong with me... I mean, it looks fantastic, is perfect on paper, and everyone else loves it... so what gives?)  I was really hoping the haggis and spicy cheese sauce would jazz it up, but it still just fell a bit flat for me personally.  All of that said, I can definitely see why people like it and the prices are great for where it is so I feel anything less than four stars would be unfair in this instance... but, if you happen to be the other 1 in 1,000,000 that doesn't love plain(ish) pulled pork sandwiches, then I'm not 100% certain that this place would change your mind.",

It used to be hot and the apple sauce was much better then. The crackling used to be better with a harder, more satisfying crunch to it. The one we had today was cold, some bits were burnt and only the top of the skin was crunchy while the rest of the fat below was still there in a hard gelatinous form.   The bun was also cold which didn't lend to the tepid pulled pork. In any case, the flavor was still there from back in the day. It was delicious nonetheless but I guess when you've made it big and have a storefront (or two, in this case), maybe you just don't work as hard like you did as a food truck only business.

I opted for the sage & onion \"stuffing\". It's really more the consistency of creamed potatoes and they do a small swipe of it on the bread, then the pork and a squeeze of sauce. It's good. The \"oink\" portion is plenty unless you're starving! I had wished I had ordered the \"piglet\" size because it's a hearty sandwich. Definitely worth trying.",

The pork was incredibly tender and the bread was super soft. In fact, I had to eat it still in the wrapper as it would have been impossible to pick it up otherwise. Delicious onion and sage stuffing (actually just a shmear). Tip - no inside seating was available as the place was SUPER busy when we arrived around lunch time. There is a decent amount of seating down the street at the square which, was only a short walk. So, grab a big pork sammich and don't forget a few napkins.",

Much to my pleasure, there on the left I saw a magnificently large roast pig in the window of a place called 'Oink'.   The name alone would have brought me in, but that pig in the window looked delicious.   The inside was cute, clean, and the staff was very friendly! But the food... holy hell the food! It is what dreams are made of! I quite literally will dream about those pulled pork sandwiches for the rest of my life!   I ordered mine without the haggis, and instead had the chutney jam; LIFE CHANGING! I don't think I even breathed while I ate that sandwich. And when it was gone I literally wanted to go order another one.   I did... but I waited until the next day! I could eat there everyday if I lived in Edinburgh.   The price was fantastic, and the food is amazing! Do yourself a favor and go Oink yourself the next time you're in Edinburgh.",

    "text": "\"How big is the 'Oink' sandwich?\"...  First off the mark I have to give a shout out to the staff who answered this question again and again with smiles on their faces while I was there. A valid question, in fairness, as the 'Oink' is the most popular choice here, but probably not great craic if you get asked it every five minutes.  Located on the very picturesque Victoria Street, Oink is the perfect place to go if you're looking for delicious food on the go. What you see is exactly what you get here, pulled pork sandwiches done really well. There's a very small seating area at the back but most people get their food to go. The service is excellent and turn-around time is probably only a couple of minutes. So how does it work? You choose your bread, size, sage and onion or haggis stuffing, sauce...and enjoy! I'd highly recommend grabbing a sandwich from here and rambling around Grassmarket, an afternoon well spent in my opinion!",

I saw the pig in the window so we jumped in line, which was out the front door but moving quickly, for some assuredly good eats.    This is a takeaway, so not much room to sit down (if any) but we took ours down the street to Grassmarket and had a picnic there.

I decided to sample some hog roast, in a tub so no roll or stuffing and the girls in store thought it might be GF but weren't totally sure. I asked for a Oink portion (3.60 for an Atkins diet dream portion of pig) and it was delish! No poisoning or GF after effects so I'll definitely return to Oink for a portion of fab hog roast :-)",

Its probably for the more carnivorous amongst us, some people may be put off by Babe in the window. But it is delicious! I like mine with a little apple sauce. I leave the crackling though, that grosses me out a bit too much. The pigs are reared on the owners farm, so its good quality meet too.  Its maybe quite gimmicky, but worth a try.",

    "text": "If you can eat pork then I cannot recommend this place enough- just thinking about it makes me drool. It serves one thing and one thing only: hog roast.  The meat is always cooked to perfection- melt in your mouth and the crackling has always been satisfying! The buns are fresh and even though there is not a huge variety in additional fillings (the apple sauce and sage and onion combo are delicious) they do them very well. Prices are not the cheapest but trust me- you will want more.  It's a tiny shop with one table and some stools so be prepared to take away. Even though the hog roast comes in buns it tends to get quite messy as they are quite generous with portions. Also the crackling goes early. What is most striking about this small modern food shop is the actual carcass of the pig is a window display. I suppose this is the best kind of advertisement. It also is quite amusing when people watching the reactions it gets- I am sure the staff here are used to the snapping of photos.   I love this funky little shop and the food is delicious. Your vegetarian friends might be in for a bit of a  shock though.",

I had told her that we need to eat haggis at some point because someone back home will ask and we cant wimp out and say no.  The very nice young man at the counter told us our sandwich options and when the dressings included haggis I asked him if it was good ( as if Id know the difference!) and he said \" yes, its homemade by my Aunt\".  Well who can say no to good home cooking?  It was actually good and I had that, the sage and onion and the applesauce on my big oink sandwich and was very happy with the entire experience as well as being able to scratch \"eating haggis\" off my list of things to do. Edinburgh in general was a wonderful place to visit and I wish we had had a few more days, but oh well, guess we'll have to go back!",

    "text": "A really original little lunch spot just up from Grassmarket, Oink was a favourite of mine during long stints at the National Library. With a whole hog roasting in the window, it reminds me of one of those Medieval feasts, eating whole animals while quaffing wine. Well there was less quaffing to be done here but the food is exactly as mouth watering as Robin Hood led me to believe as a child.  The pig is slow cooked, so is really tender and flavoursome. And thankfully it is nice and juicy as well, not dried out like pork in so many other places. You don't really have much of a choice if you want food here, you're going to get food so lucky it's really good. You do have a choice with the extras though, you can add a selection of the following: - sage and onion stuffing - pork crackling - apple sauce - chilli sauce  The rolls are about 4 quid, and whilst a bit more expensive than a sarnie from other cafes, are absolutely amazing. They are also ridiculously filling as well, so you don't have that feeling half an hour after you walk out where you're hungry again. If you want excellent, slightly original food then look no further.",

    "text": "I like pork a lot, so I guess it makes sense that I'd like A LOT of pork.  Situated on Victoria St. right off of the grassmarket, Oink is an honest, unassuming eatery specializing in pulled-pork sandwiches.  Did I say specializing?  Is there a word for \"it's the only thing on the menu\"? There isn't?  Well alright then.  If you do not like pork: first of all, what the hell man?  Second of all, this isn't the place for you.  In fact, you probably should have been warned off by the roast pig carcass in the window.  Yes, they have one of those.  You walk up to the counter in what is a rather small looking space, with seating for about 5-6 people.  There you can order one of three things.... ALL OF THEM ARE A PULLED PORK SANDWICH!  Just differing sizes of such.  You have the choice of the roll (white or brown), the choice of topping (haggis or sage and onion stuffing or both) and the choice of relish (apple or chili).  This may seem like a difficult decision, but let me assure you: THERE ARE NO WRONG ANSWERS.  Any and every combination will be no more or less mouth-watering and delicious as any other.    The person working there (always nice) will then proceed to scrape a generous portion of pig (as in directly from the pig) onto your roll, wrap it some plastic and deliver it to your trembling hands.  This will set you back between 3 and 5 quid, depending on the size.  Now there's not a huge amount of seating, so if you go on a weekend, you may find it difficult to find a place to sit.  This is ok, however, because there are no end to the benches down on Grassmarket.  Plus, several of them have a view of that castle-y thingamajig everybody seems to rave about.  **Hint, if you leave make sure to grab a fork and a napkin (pulled pork has a tendency to fall out of things...)  I hope I have conveyed (without actually saying so) that Oink is awesome and you should never eat anywhere else and you should give me all of your money.  But in case I haven't made that clear... GO TO OINK, you won't regret it.  I accept most major credit cards.",

    "text": "As I was wandering the streets of Edinburgh in search of a quick lunch near the castle, I came across Oink. First off, what a great name. Seriously, Oink? Add to that the fact that the storefront is accented with a flamboyant shade of hot pink, and you've caught my attention from afar. But wait, it gets better. As I approached the storefront, I was greeted by the sight of a whole-roasted pig, head and all, staring back at me through the window. Sure, I loved Babe just as much as the next child, but any time a roasted animal is presented to me, any affectionate childhood memories I may have had are pushed to the backburner.  Since I'm Chinese, I am perfectly comfortable with and used to seeing animals cooked whole, head and all. Suckling pigs, steamed fish, and roasted chickens are all commonly prepared and served with their heads still on, so seeing a cooked animal head isn't particularly shocking. But for some reason, many Americans get freaked out or disgusted by seeing animal heads. Does the fact that the animal's head is still on somehow make the food seem more alive or less suitable for consumption? I don't know, it just seems so irrational to me when someone is grossed out by seeing a cooked chicken head but is perfectly content with eating chicken wings and drumsticks from the KFC down the street. They all come from the same animal, so what's the big deal? Besides, when was the last time you had a whole-roasted animal that wasn't delicious? Right, never.  Okay, moving on to the actual food. Well, if you couldn't tell by the name of the store or the fact that there's a roasted pig sitting in front of the window, Oink specializes in hog roasts. There's one thing and one thing only on their menu: pulled pork sandwiches. The only choices you have are the size of the sandwich and the type of roll, spread, and relish. Since I'm a fatass and of the belief that there is a positive correlation between the amount of meat on a sandwich and said sandwich's tastiness, I went with the \"Grunter,\" which has more than eight ounces of pork stuffed inside of a soft roll. Topped with haggis and both the apple and chili relishes and crowned with a piece of crispy pork crackling, this was a behemoth of a sandwich and quite a sight to behold. Not greasy in the slightest and with all of the subcutaneous fat rendered, the pork crackling was superb, reminiscent of the crisp skin that you would get with a Chinese suckling pig. The sandwich, overflowing with so much meat that you can't even see the bottom bun in the pictures, was exactly what you would expect more than half a pound of pork stuffed inside of a roll to taste like: insanely delicious and fatty. The meat was actually a bit on the dry side, but that's where the haggis, apple relish, and chili relish came into play, as they all helped to add a bit of moisture to the sandwich without completely soaking the bun.  Ten minutes and countless napkins later, I sat back in my seat with an immense feeling of satisfaction. I'm no pulled pork connoisseur, but this was most certainly a terrific rendition of the sandwich, so much so in fact that I hopped back on line to get another sandwich for my dinner on the train ride home that evening. 4.60 for a sandwich of this size is an extremely fair deal, and I walked away perfectly sated and content. If I should ever find myself back in Edinburgh sometime in the future, Oink would definitely be near the top of my list of places to visit.",

Ladies and gents, your attention please.... I. Am. In. Love.  They say the best ideas are simple and this is no exception. In a nutshell, this place sells pork sandwiches. End of.  Oh okay there are a few variables to throw in there for the thinking man (or woman!):  Small, medium or large? White or brown? Haggis or stuffing? Cranberry or apple sauce? Drink?  Wow, lot to think about there. Now I'm hungry again..... wonder if I can get up there in 20 mins...? Traffic should be alright......  Whoa! Talk about digression! Oink clearly brings out the caveman in me! Actually I'm surprised I didn't come up with this idea as this is pretty much all I ate in Sydney as they have these roast delis all over the place. Good job I didn't as there's no way I could compete with the meaty perfection of Oink.  Absolute godsend.  Bloke behind the counter is a good lad too.  COUPLE OF TIPS FOR THE NEWBY:  1) The crackling is phenomenal. Get there early, ask for crackling.  2) The hog is cooked in gravy. If you like gravy, be sure to ask the guy for the meat at the bottom of the dish. Wow!",

If you're from USA like I am, you might think you'll miss the smoke flavor in what looks a bit like pulled pork. Trust me, you won't.  This whole pig is lovingly roasted for 12-14 hours and then carved into sandwiches, served on a soft white or wheat roll with either rosemary onion relish or haggis (trust me, get the haggis) and sweet chili sauce or apple sauce.  The haggis provides just the right level of earthiness to cut through the salty fat of the port.  And don't forget to ask for cracklin, a square of crispy skin cut with kitchen shears and placed on the roll.  Get there early as they make one hog a day, and they sell out.",

I told her that was an incredibly rude thing to say and she said we weren't welcome back. By far the most awful dining experience I'v ever had.

Then serve up big shredded portions of him on a bun with a choice (or combination) of sage and onion, apple sauce or sweet chilli relish. Additionally you can get some crackling for an extra 50p or so. Brilliant.   I'm deducting 1 star for the fact that you can't get a nice cold beer to wash it down. Otherwise no complaints from me!",

We were wandering down Victoria Street looking for a Middle Eastern place where my daughter could get a falafel when we passed by OINK.  There's a beautiful golden roasted pig in the window that they are pulling the meat off for sandwiches and I know that this is my lunch.  Not many options at OINK: White or brown bread Haggis or sage stuffing Apple sauce or chili relish Crackling or no crackling Small, medium or large  There is a counter with a few stools and a table with a couple of chairs but mostly it is a carry-out business.  It was a beautiful day so we took our sandwiches down the block to a small square at the intersection of Victoria and Grassmarket and ate on a bench outside with the pigeons.  It was perfect.  It's that simple.  The staff were delightful and the sandwich was even better.  This is quality stuff served up by people who love what they do and they do it well.  I would travel the 3000 miles back to Edinburgh for another one of those delicious sandwiches.",

    "text": "Brilliant idea. Put a roasted pig in the window and feed him/her to the public. When the meat of this pig is gone, close the shop.  All they sell is this pig all day. What a wonderful concept, so simple and soooooooooooooooooo delicious. The taste is more like American style pulled-pork BBQ, though without the smokiness or BBQ sauce. With this, you get sage and onion seasoning sprinkled on it, and perhaps some haggis or sweet apple sauce on top. I live in Germany now, and this would be the only place outside of Germany in Europe that would make me forsake a Bratwurst.   Only caveat--- the bread was cheap, horrible hamburger buns straight out of the supermarket aisle. Yuck! They need decent bread, something as hearty and heavy to stand up to the pork. Some artisan, handmade bread would complement the handmade meat, instead of being a cheap-ass afterthought. I deducted 1 star for the horrible bread rolls.",

You get through the line fairly quickly and once you get the food, there's usually a seat to sit and enjoy the pork.  People were steaming and flooding this place all day.

So we had some lunch options, one was a tattie place, or another pub if that was busy, but this was beckoning to us.   We continued our touristy walk down to Parliament Building, and came back up the street.  So simple.  Pick a size, pick a bread, want stuffing, pick a sauce.   I didn't want to ask a ton of questions because of a food allergy, so I asked for chilli cheese sauce on the side.   It was a little spicer than I wanted, but the sandwich did NOT NEED IT.  It was SO damn moist.  (And I hate that word). Usually pulled pork needs some sauce, living in the US, it's BBQ, or slathered in something - this DID NOT.  I honestly didn't notice the sage onion dressing until my last bite, so all I got was pork heavenliness.    Nice sit down place to rest and enjoy your meal.",

Try walking by the massive, chopped pig with head on in the window and NOT stopping to salivate. Just try it.  This sandwich is hands down the best in Edinburgh. Order whatever size you think you can handle with the haggis stuffing and apple sauce. Your mouth will come alive like Lazarus being raised from the dead.   As a self-professed roasted, chopped pig aficionado, I can guarantee Oink will be one of the best, if not the best, pork sandwiches you will EVER eat. Let us all pray that they never move from their delightful Victoria Street storefront, unless it is to open up delicious franchises all across the country.",

So it was a little strange to walk around Edinburgh and see (a much smaller) whole hog in the window at Oink.  Strange but tasty.  This was a little different than the whole hog that I'm used to in Middle Tennessee, but it was excellent.  Really liked the piece of crackling on the sandwich - that was a really interesting texture on top of the pork.  Friendly staff, sell what you cooked and then that's it.  Just another great spot in Edinburgh.",

    "text": "Piggy goodness!  Look, I am a shameless carnivore.  One of my two favorite shirts is from Boccalone in San Francisco (Chris Cosentino's salumeria).  The other is a print of a creepily delighted pig slicing itself into saucisson.  So when a joint advertises itself by placing an entire roast pig in the window, which is gradually being shredded bit by bit over the course of the day, I'M THERE.  For some, the sight of a whole roasted animal being slowly pulled apart is grotesque.  For me, it is grotesquely delightful.  And oh, was it succulent, my friends.  And oh, my children, did the crispy exterior merit the high praise of PORK CANDY.  I can't believe I'm saying this, but now one of the best pulled pork sandwiches I have ever had was in the United Kingdom (and proud nation of Scotland!).  To be fair, I'm an Amurricun, and my great preference for pulled pork is with a healthy dash of low-temp smoking and some Carolinas/Arkansas-style vinegar sauce.  But the methode-UK isn't so bad, either...I would've opted for the haggis and chilli sauce sandwich, but they were out of haggis.  I was already in a festive mood from the Christmas Market, so I plopped myself at a table, my massive sandwich bedecked with sage and onion stuffing and applesauce.  I will be hard pressed not to eat one of these every time I go to Edinburgh.  Keep me away from Victoria Street, I beg of you!",

    "text": "It isn't everyday you come across a whole roast pig. That is unless you are in Spain or France. Both countries notorious for their love of pork and roasting the piggies in their entirety.   I was immediately drawn to this place. A decade ago I probably would've thought it barbaric to see such a sight, but now with two Pollan books under my belt I feel better about actually seeing the pig that I am about to eat Of course the next step according to M.Pollan would be to go out and kill it myself. Well, we just haven't reached that level yet. But I like that instead of seeing dissected pieces of meat in no way resembling a pig, we actually see what we are eating. It's much more of an organic experience, one step closer to nature. Yes, I do realise I am getting very philosophical. This is something that tends to happen quite often.  They were out of the brown buns so we had the white. The buns are the traditional scottish rolls that I have come to love. In total you are entitled to 4 choices here.   1. The size of your roll.  2. Whether or not said roll is white or brown  3. The filling: sage & onion stuffing or haggis  4.  Lastly the sauce, apple sauce or chilli sauce.      Thats it.  To many, that may not seem like enough choices. As consumers nowadays we love to have millions of options. Yet, I have come to understand that when a place has less choice, this means they get to concentrate on obtaining excellent quality ingredients. That is exactly what has happened here. Because this place only offers one sandwich they have perfected it.   Another plus is that they have root beer in the fridge.",

My advice however is to get there early, because OINK is very popular - mainly because it offers the chance of something different to eat in the city.  Speaking to the jolly man who served me, I also found out that not only does OINK have its own premises, it can be found in the weekly farmers market along with the two farmers who own the place, still selling thier wares.  OINK is something different, and very tasty - if you can get there in time!",

The options fairly simple--you choose your bread (white or wheat), and your filling (slow-roasted pork, haggis, or both), sauces (there are several options) and crackling or not, and that's pretty much it. The sandwiches are definitely tasty, but ultimately not especially interesting, though they hit the spot for us and fortified us to continue our walking through the old town.",

For under 6 I got a medium pulled pork serving which was quiet plentiful in my opinion and filling. The pulled pork tastes wonderful and is highly comparable to proper american BBQ. The place always would seem to have a line out the door and is fast at getting you your food. For this quality pulled pork you really cant manage to find anything that could beat it for the price.

I ordered the grunter which is the largest size sandwich and paired it with haggis and spicy cheese sauce. This was my first time trying haggis and it was very good, but if that isn't quite your taste, then there are other topping options like sage and onion!  Great location as well and very friendly staff that helped me make a decision (I needed help deciding what to pair with Haggis).",

    "text": "This place came super recommended. It's just on Victoria Street, so it's very convenient for seeing the sites and stopping by for lunch. The interior is really cute and homey. It's pretty good deal (There are three sizes for pork rolls: Piglet 3.40 pounds, Oink 4.60 pounds, grunter 5.80 pounds).   Tastewise, it's a'ight. There wasn't anything special about the pork itself as it was quite dry and bland even with the sauce. The bun was just your regular run of the mill.   Bonus: If you do check this place out, make sure you ask for the freeee crackling (aka roasted pork skin). Be sure to get there early for lunch as they may run out.   We went around 1pm and there was a long line out the door. So perhaps aim to go slightly early to beat the crowds. The place itself is quite small, so if there is a line, you might not be able to wait it out and snag a seat inside which is just as well because eating in a park or on the go is just as fun.",

It's especially cool because they display the pig so you can see the progress. I would walk by at different times on different days and it was fascinating.   When I ordered one for myself I got the small with mustard mayo and onion sage stuffing. It was delicious! The meat is tender and juicy, with seasoning not too strong.  Worth going back a few times to try the different mixes they offer. I only had it once but had I had more time, you bet i'd be spending it here.",

Only downside is that its a small shop, so if its busy you may not get a seat. I would stick to either right before or right after the lunch rush to get a table.

A) because they taste amazing. Oink slow roasts one pig a day and serves it till it runs out. The meat is extremely juicy and flavorful.  B) prices are very good. A good size pork sandwich on roll with either haggis or stuffing is 4.20.  C)  The experience and scene on Victoria street is entertaining.  I would recommend the larger sandwich the grunter, with haggis, and pepper jam. It's mind blowingly good. Ask for some cracklings with it. They are free with the sandwich and pork skin heaven.  Take Away plenty of napkins as it's messy",

I do like that they give you pieces of the skin (which is the best part by the way).  The shop is extremely small - only room for maybe 20 total diners. My family of 5 decided to order the meat in a togo box and eat with a fork.   Overall it was really good. The apple sauce was maybe a little too sweet for my liking. I wish they had Mang Tomas as one of the sauce options.",

This sandwich made me feel like I needed to put Haggis on absolutely everything going forward. The taste was perfection. It was a well crafted sandwich.  I was pleasantly surprised by the cost - it was less than what I was expecting to spend.  The staff worked quickly and efficiently and got through the line very quickly.

You first choose the size of your roll (piglet, oink, or grunter) and type of roll (white or brown). Then, you pick the stuffing, sage and apple or the traditional haggis (both are delicious!!). There are 5 different sauces you can choose from to finish off your hog roast roll (apple and chili jam are my top picks!).   There is seating inside (stoolside), but very limited. The sandwiches come wrapped in foil, making it really convenient to take on the go! The pulled pork was so good we had to get more for the road! Be sure to ask for crackling!",

Between 3 various sizes of sandwich all below 8 pounds, you get a ton of pork, some stuffing (haggis or sage and onion), and a sauce to choose from. The pork is really tender and tasty. Bread is decent. Haggis acts some great texture and flavor. I really wish they had more sauce since it would really inject some more flavor. You can also get it without bread in a take out box. Overall, a really good value and would recommend. Only downside is the lack of sauce and wee size",

Ok ok, there are other really memorable moments in my trip, but I honest can say that if I have to list my top 10 most memorable moments, Oink would be somewhere on top.  If I am to list my BEST meal in this UK trip, Oink is DEFINITELY on the tippy top.  It's that good.  It really is....   Hubbo and I first shared a \"grunter', their largest size sandwich.  We picked their spicy chili cheese sauce and haggis with lots of cracklins.  After my first bite, I told him to get his own...  I polished off the grunter and got up and bought a t-shirt and another grunter to take with me.  The store clerk asked where we were from.  \"Jacksonville, northeast FL\", I replied.  He was surprised and said he thought we would have plenty of BBQ pork places like Oink.    Yeah, not like this.... roasted whole hog stuffed with herbs with crispy skin and haggis?  Nope, definitely not.  The next day, we returned and bought three more grunters and asked the store clerk to 'package them well cause they are traveling'!  Yep, we took them on the train with us as we were leaving Edinburgh.",

The space itself isn't the most attractive or welcoming, and I briefly attempted small chat with the two workers but quickly discovered that they pretty much wanted to fill my roll and be done with me.    I got my roll with haggis and a chili relish and while it was tasty and juicy, I appreciated the chili relish for the zing it added as without it, the roll would have been pretty bland.  I was given and saw no napkins, so felt that I'd rather made a mess of myself as well.    All in all, a rather disappointing experience.

    "text": "My husband & I were really excited to try Oink based on the strong yelp reviews that it had AND based on the fact that many, many locals told us repeatedly that it was a go to spot for them.  We actually tried to go the day before after a scotch tour but arrived too late in the day & they were already sold out (3:30pm).    So sad to report that we were quite disappointed.  I'll start w/the good: LOVE the location.  The street it is located on is a super adorable windy street w/tons of great shopping, pubs & whiskey shops nearby.  In addition, the roasted pig is presented right in front of the store front window so you immediately see it & it definitely catches peoples attention.  However.....maybe it's just because my husband makes AMAZING pulled pork & sauces and but I found the pork & sauces themselves to be just meh.  The pork really lacked flavor & spices - was actually quite bland.  I chose the sage & onion stuffing & the chili sauce as my two condiments & again, I just felt that both really lacked any flavor & bite to them.    I still give this place an extra star for uniqueness & it's ability to pull you in - but when it comes to the actual quality of the meal - I hate to admit it, but I was quite disappointed.",

I had added this on my list of places to try in Edinburgh because the husband and I are both fans of the pig, and with all of the rave reviews, we figured we couldn't go wrong. And we were right!   We stopped by for an early lunch after visiting Edinburgh castle, and Oink was everything we hoped it would be. Pink storefront and roasting pig in the window? Check! It doesn't get much fresher than that.  There was only one person in front of us, and two people enjoying their sandwiches at a table near the door. Because it wasn't packed, the owner bantered with us for a few minutes and he was very friendly.   We each ordered the medium sized option - mine with haggis, apple, and chili sauce on wheat, and my husband's with haggis and BBQ sauce on wheat. The owner also threw in a piece of crackling for my husband, which my husband loved. We grabbed a bottle of water, a handful of napkins, and were able to snag two of the seats indoors where we thoroughly enjoyed the porky goodness.  It was a perfect, delicious lunch. We didn't spend much money and left full and happy. Until the next time, Oink!!",

    "text": "The phenomenon of  \"Roadkill cusine\" has popped up in the media semi-regularly over the past few years as an alternative to Waitrose for thrifty carnivores nationwide. Unsurprisingly, flicking on the hazard lights and popping to the side of the road to bury one's head in the entrails of a recently flattened fox is still an acquired taste to some, but for those \"on the fence\" so to speak, Oink provides the ideal introduction.  It's fair to say that the British office monkey can often feel limited to a number of fairly sanitised options. The neverending stream of social-climbing delis half-heartedly scoop out bowls of hummus or red pesto chicken onto a tiresome array of flatbreads and as we fester in the queue, running down our precious minutes, the feeling that we're eating inauthentic crap made by arseholes, for arseholes never strays too far away. But Oink is different. There's not a ciabbata in sight. Just some plain bread rolls, some rudimentary sauces and the putrefying remains of an unfortunate local swine. Be in no doubt that this is the grisliest, most brutal and downright best lunch on offer in Scotland.  The animalistic experience on offer at Oink really is second to none. Looking on, mouth watering as the staff hack at the rotting carcass before feasting upon the ragged, sweaty flesh of the wretched pig is the closest most of us will ever get to those basal predatory instincts long lost to evolution. And all for about four quid.  After just one visit to Oink, you'll see a congealing tub of room-temperatrure mediterranean tuna salad for what it really is. Pathetic.",

If you're a red-blooded carnivore, you'll surely enjoy. I hope you enjoy. Please enjoy! I love this place and if YOU, dear reader, don't like this place, I don't think we have very similar tastes and my reviews are probably wasted on you. Exceptions for vegans/vegetarians.  Life-pro-tip: Probably not a good idea to go swimming for a day or two after eating at Oink. Actually, you probably shouldn't attempt ANY vigorous activity, because this place is like taking a delicious meaty headbutt to the stomach.",

We had 3 sandwiches (2 for the husband, 1 for me) and 2 bottles of water for under 15.

For less the a fiver you get a good sized roll with heaps of meat on it. You can choose from a white or whole wheat bun, one spread and one sauce. You can get either haggis or apples and then bbq sauce or a gravy I think. Either way, anything they offer is a tasty addition.  I opted for the haggis as I hadn't really tried it properly yet here and it added a nice flavour with the deliciously, well-cooked meat. I am not normally a pork eater, but on this occasion it was totally necessary as it was a delicious and different eat. We took it away and ate it in the park off Grassmarket, to bask in the sun and stuff our wee faces. It is a very tasty option and doesn't feel too gluttonous, as you can order a kid sized roll to feel less like a carnivore. Although for the price, go big or go home I say.

    "text": "Visual of the whole roasted pig draws you to this place.  Expecting an above average to stellar pulled pork was implied given their simple yet fun menu.  The pork was good, but methinks a bit too salted with the crackling and haggis. Darn, shoula woulda gotten the applesauce to mellow it with some sweetness..but thought it a bit overboard w/ toppings.  It was good enough for my lunch/snack(?) but nothing beyond the norm.  It wasn't great, just simple straightforward good- enough. Would not mind trying another, next time with a fun mix of different toppings.  Its a fun joint for a hearty, on- the-go bite but not necessarily my first or second choice.  All in all, not bad.",

This little place is great for meat craving. We got a pulled pork roll with stuffing and we managed to grab a little seat next to the window and chomp chomp. Its not the fancied of places, infact id say that its more of a takeaway, grab and go styleee. Definatley worth trying and great value for money.",

Day 1 - got the regular roll, wheat bread, sage and onion stuffing, apple sauce.  forgot to ask for a cracklin.  Don't forget to ask for the cracklin!!!  As I was eating it, I knew I would be back.  I actually planned my day to make sure I could get back.  Day 2 - got the bigger sandwich, all of the above, some mil chili sauce and remembered the cracklin (whew.  What kind of Southerner am I, forgetting a cracklin?  Oh wait, I am a Northerner; I just live in the South.)  Note - minimal seating, so be willing to cram in next to some new friends.  Mine were two old gentlemen who were taking a break from rugby watching.  They made sure I had napkins when I needed them.  Got a mocha both days - very good!",

Since I'm pregnant and not trying to be healthy like usual, I indulged in the delicious pulled pork (literally straight from the roasted pig in the window) on a brown roll with sage/onion stuffing and applesauce - divine!  Would highly recommend that combo, although my husband would say he likes it with haggis and hot chili sauce, but that's the best bit - there's something for everyone.  Sandwiches come in different sizes so you can stuff yourself or just have a bit of lunch.  It's cheap, the meat is delicious and juicy, and the condiment choices are simple but brilliant.  It's an Edinburgh staple and a must-try if you're in town!",

My girlfriend and I split two sandwiches - one with haggis and mustard mayo, and one with sage and onion and apples. Both offer something a little different and are equally excellent. The sage/onion/apple pairing is probably the better overall, as it mixes some good sweetness to counterbalance the richness of the pork. That's not to say that the haggis and mustard isn't good, it's just richer. I'd happily have again either in the future.",

    "text": "I was catching up on what's new in the Yelpiverse, when Oink fell into the top spot on my \"Your Next Review Awaits\" queue. I'm obviously slacking.  So... this Oink is pretty much a carbon copy of THIS Oink: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/oink-edinburgh-3?hrid=3jEMkh0j3cmGh_nPJpdNqQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)\">yelp.co.uk/biz/oink-edin...</a>  Therefore, my sentiments in that review ring True for this spot as well. Oink remains to be one of the best spots to score a quick meal under 5. I still opt for The Grunter, because i'm still a monster. I have branched out into apple sauce (I know, so cool.) and my intuition on the extra sauce was on point.   So what new tidbits have I picked up since last year in the land of Oink?  Did you know you can order a WHOLE HOG?! I was delighted. I have yet to do it, but the fact that it's an easily ordered possibility makes me happy. Unfortunately, I rarely have occasions where I need to feed 130 meat eaters, but I remain hopeful.  The catering option I most recently found and will likely weave its way into an event soon is the Leg It. You can order a whole leg of pork that feeds 25 people for 90. It even comes with stuffing, rolls & apple sauce. So that's brilliant.  I'm always on the look out for spots that could potential feed an event with very little effort on my part, so this was a happy happenstance, but until I get my hands on a reason to order a hog leg, i'll happily stick with Oink being my \"i'm lazy and it's cheap\" lunch refuge.",

We came to eat here twice and had:  the Oink (medium sandwich) on brown bread...one with haggis and one with sage and onion stuffing.  the Grunter (large sandwich) on white bread (a whole lot more meat)...this time both with haggis...one with mustard/mayo sauce and one with sweet pepper jelly.  So. Dang.GOOD!! Great prices too! Kept us fed and warm during our stay.  You gotta go here! Staff are VERY friendly and quick with the orders.  Tip: the Piglet is a small roll with meat. the Oink is a medium size roll with meat and the Grunter is also a medium size roll only with double the meat of the Oink. Only two choices of bread; brown or white..(but you don't need more than that)",

We got a piglet with stuffing and apple and an oink with haggis and homemade BBQ sauce. Of the two, I highly recommend the haggis and BBQ sauce combo. It was really flavorful and complemented the pork. The stuffing/apple combo was a little bland by comparison, although still good. A great place to grab a quick, affordable and tasty lunch!",

Basically Oink kills a farm-fresh pig everyday, cook and season the meat, and sell the pork sandwiches until they run out of pork from that ONE pig that day. Let me tell you this meat is delicious. So flavorful, so juicy and perfectly seasoned. You can get your sammy with 2 choices of bread (white or brown), 2 choices of stuffing (haggis or onion/sage I think -- BOTH are delicious but I prefer the latter), and a choice of topping. My favorite is their apple relish. OMFG. This pork with pieces of apple and the stuffing on the toasted soft bun....HEAVEN. I ate here twice on my 5 day trip. I just couldn't get enough! Seriously, I wish we had something like this in California. Farm-fresh meat and quality sandwiches = a winning combo!  BONUS- Super affordable to eat here. A piglet sized sandwich will fill me up and it's only $2.60 euro or so. C'mon what a steal!",
