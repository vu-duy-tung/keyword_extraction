We shared an appetizer plate with a variation of meets, cheeses, and olives. We also tried the crab spread, which was so yummy! For meals, my husband had the mussels and I had the beet and goat cheese risotto. Both meals were wonderful!",

    "text": "The only downside to Ecco Vino is that it's always busy, so if you don't get here early to secure your wine tasting seat, you might end up being disappointed and having to trundle off elsewhere. Situated on good old Cockburn Street, this is a fairly recent addition to the Cockburn hood, but has definitely been a popular one.   I really rate the look of Ecco Vino, with its wooden wine cellar feel and European bar atmosphere to it. There is, of course, an extensive range of wines on the menu here, so if you're a bit of a connoisseur, or fancy yourself as one, then this is a brill place to come and try out different wines. The food is also super tasty and reasonably priced, with the menu including some Italian pasta options and the ever spot hitting Antipasti. Very, very cool.",

We were so unlucky with out timing that they were still preparing the food of the people who'd got there 5 minutes before we had. So there we were, sat in this lovely little bar-come-eaterie, surrounded by the tantalising smells of garlic and cheeses, watching others eat, whilst we were starving! Oh well, we'll have better luck next time.  Where we missed out on food, we made up for in wine. What a fantastic selection. Some by the glass, and some by the bottle. I treated myself to some delicious Malbec.  Cosy, rustic decor, and really friendly staff, make this an ideal spot for a quick bite to eat or whiling away the hours stating into the bottom of your glass.  And yes, the food looked delicious.",

The wines themselves,  go down very nicely thank you, particularly when accompanied with some of their delicious bread and tasty olives.    The real working fire makes you feel all warm and cosy, particularly against a backdrop of an inevitably wet and windy Edinburgh. It;s the equivalent of a nice hot bath with a mug of cocoa or wearing your comfiest cleanest pijamas.   The staff are brilliant. A perfect mix of competent and nonchalant, to make you feel perfectly at ease.

The menu goes on for miles and miles and miles. SO much to choose from and decide between. The food here was delicious and so fresh and seasonal as well. I devoured my plate of perfectly flavoured king prawns that were absolutely drenched in garlic. It was absolute perfection with my glass of Argentinian malbec the size of my dome. Man, I'm salivating just thinking about it all again...  The restaurant is quite small, but very intimate and tastefully decorated. Be sure to book, this place fills up fast. But it has a lovely ambiance and a wonderful buzzing feel to it in the evening time.   I was not able to try dessert here, but I must say whatever chocolate cake they had on the menu looked like a piece of heaven.",

I didn't even include what my date drank. The bill wasn't pretty, but the bar was, even after I drunkenly knocked my glass over. It will be a wonder if they let me back on the premises, shame on me indeed.",

I walked inside and the place was packed, so we went and took a seat in the small blocked off street area just outside the pub and had browse at the wine menu.  Ecco Vino sell loads of wine by the glass, but we thought we would get a bottle...why not eh? After much deliberation and a mini-argument, I admitted defeat and went for my other halfs choice of white. We got a bottle of Alpha Zeta Pinot Grigio for 18.50, much more than we would usually spend on a bottle of plonk but we decided to treat ourselves! The barman brought it out in a cooler bucket and set our glasses out for us, allowing us to taste it and see if we liked it (its wine, I like it. End of) Very professional and made it seem a bit more reasonably priced!  I would definitely come back here, the outside seating is prime for people watching and great on a sunny day.",

    "text": "Wine bars in Edinburgh are peculiar places as they always seem to be tucked away on the quieter streets or under bridges and Ecco Vino is one of those too!  Great wine list - selections to suit all budgets. I was here for a post Doors Open Day glass of vino which turned out to be a bottle between 3 once we saw the wine of the month was a cheeky little Picpoul. Tasty and it went down too well, we resisted temptation to order another bottle. Service was great and we were under no pressure to vacate our table, so we had a lovely gossipy, catch up time, savouring food and wine.  I didn't have food but the dessert portions look very generous and the seafood looks very good and cooked perfectly. I'll definitely return  and next time, I'll be settling in for some nibbles and some more vino.",

We were told that it may take awhile to get our food as they were short staffed but since we weren't starving we decided to stay. The service was a bit slow but I didn't think it was any slower than other places in the UK. I ordered a glass of wine and the risotto of the day which was a broccoli, leek, and Gorgonzola risotto. It was delicious! It was a little greasy but I assume that was from the massive amounts of cheese in it. I would definitely try this place again on my next trip to Edinburgh.",

    "text": "I found this place for dinner in Edinburgh because I know how much the other half loves wines and wine bars. A friend had suggested quite a few places for dinner, but none of them seemed overly exciting to him, so we came here.  We came in on a Thursday night around 6:30 and the place was already quite busy. For me, that's a sign of a good place! We were seated at a table, and quite soon afterwards a large party came in, so we all shifted around to give them more seating (which turned out to be a HUGE mistake).   We started with a bottle of English white wine and a cheese plate. It consisted of three cheese. We chose it over the meat and cheese plate solely because that one contained manchego and gorganzola. Both nice cheeses, but nothing special. One of the people at the other table really wasn't paying any attention to anything around her except chatting while trying to get up, so she knocked a bottle of water over onto our cheese plate. They did end up getting us another cheese plate (which hey, it might have been cheese overload, but oh well), which consisted of four cheeses instead of three. And two of them were different. It's a bit strange that they opted to give us the manchego and gorganzola on the second plate in place of one of the cheeses, but maybe they were out.  We then ordered some Italian red wine and the spaghetti with salami in a garlic cream sauce and the ham risotto. It took awhile due to the large table next to us, but we weren't in a hurry so we just enjoyed our wine. The mains were good. We also split the sticky toffee pudding at the end with some port, and that was probably the least good thing of the night. It wasn't sticky enough for me!  The table of twelve next to us kind of ballooned into around 20 by the end. It was a bit too much for such a small restaurant. I kind of wish they told them they couldn't accommodate such a large party, but I don't even think they thought it was going to get as big as it did!   The owner (I think he was the owner, who knows?) came up to us at the end, and he started talking with us a bit about wine. He said we had good taste and picked some of the better wine on the menu. That's always a pleasant surprise!",

It's got a really comfortable atmosphere, and nothing about it feels pretentious, which is rare for Edinburgh. Their food is yummy too, I shared a small starter with my mum to line my stomach before a bottle of Sincere (cold, I might add) and desperately want to go back for a full meal.

    "text": "I never thought I'd be a wine bar kind of guy. I'm still not sure that I am. But I went to this wine bar and I liked it. And then I went again. And again. So there you have it. The thirty-something bloke doth protest too much, methinks.  Ecco Vino is best described as a wine bar but you could consider it a cafe or even an informal restaurant. You can just pop in for a couple of drinks or you can have a light bite (like sharing an antipasti plate) or have a starter and main just like anywhere else. They don't take bookings, so that keeps it fairly casual, although that can be a pain when you want to meet people there and don't know if you'll get a table.  The style of the food is modern Italian. Antipasti obviously, with a selection of salads and pastas but not your usual chequered tablecloth standards. More like chorizo, peppers and tomato or salami, mushroom and rocket.   It fills a niche in the Edinburgh dining scene, hitting the spot when you want a couple of drinks and nibbles or something light but you're not sure what kind of place you're looking for. Not quite a bar or a restaurant, somewhere with a bit of class but not stuffy (I was going to say \"just like me\" but I already used that line in my last review - I really need to update my material), centrally located so you can go before or after some other engagement. Stop beating around the bush, you're looking for a wine bar. And so, I guess, am I.",

Granted there seems to be quite a few in Edinburgh in particular but this does not mean that the clients who aren't willing to bring out the plastic card aren't worthy of some sort of service!   I came here with three friends to celebrate a birthday. The girl serving us gave a little huf when we hadn't booked a table (for a Wednesday at 6pm we didn't think there would be a rush) and seated us in a corner. Turns out this was her blind corner and proceeded to ignore us for the rest of the meal.    Other than this, it's actually a lovely little restaurant, quite small though. Don't bother with the anti-pasti dish- it's a bit of a rip off, but the main courses are delicious and the atmosphere (apart from the waitress) was grand. It's actually a wine bar more than a restaurant and it would be ideal for a special date!",

It brings a touch of continental flavour to this part of Edinburgh, with its open bay windows, and contemporary interior. Wine lines the walls, and the dimmed lights make for a nice, easy going ambiance that takes you a step away from the busy throng of Edinburgh's city centre..  They have an aboslutely delicious menu available from lunchtime, where you can get anything from soup and a panini to mackeral salad (which is making me ravenous just thinking about how tasty it is). They also have some gorgeous spaghetti dishes, including one with capers and anchovies (so this place is winning me over by the second). They also have some less frilly options for those of you who don't like capers (seriously, how could you not?), and their cheese is supplied from the prestigious cheesemonger Iain Mellis.  There's a nice, refined and relaxed atmosphere in this restaurant. Even when it's raining it still gets a lot of business and is beautiful to sit in. They know their wines, and the wine list is detailed, informative and classy. They offer up very tasty whites, reds, rose and high quality champagne. Prices vary from 3.70 a glass to 50 pounds for a bottle of the really good stuff. If you can't be tempted by their wine specialities, there are chilled Kronenburg and Sam Miguel on tap.  It's the kind of place you can have a meet with friends, a business lunch or a memorable first date. Absolutely lovely.",

The service is top notch and they were very helpful about getting us a great table on short notice. It always appears to be busy, which is a comfortable sign for travelers.",

We went back for dinner the next night and shared the mussels in cream sauce for a starter; they were really delicious!  The small serving was quite enough for the two of us. For a main course I had the catch of the day, which was rainbow trout that day. My husband had pork belly. Both dishes were tasty. We shared a bottle of wine which was quite good, it also was a special that day.   The place is popular and we had to have our drinks and appetizer outside. We moved inside later when a table opened up. Maybe book a table if you want to be sure of seating.",

Yes, it's as good as everyone says. We really loved the selection of food and wine options here. A great experience for our first night in Edinburgh after a long day of traveling. Perfect spot for a romantic date, too!",

    "text": "A lovely place for warm-up drinks before going to see a stand-up show at the fringe - though it turns out we didn't really need it, he was actually very funny sans alcohol. At least I think he would've been.  We were craving wine and cheese (admittedly I seem to do so for most of my waking hours) so this place halfway up the most amusingly named street in Edinburgh (yes my sense of humour is quite immature sometimes) seemed an ideal spot.  It wasn't too busy on a bank holiday weekend early evening and after a moment of dithering we took a high table for two next to the bar. My friend chose us a Portuguese red wine from their hefty selection that I hadn't heard of before; a great choice on his part as it was really delicious and went down far too easily. As did one of their large mixed sharing platters - I would've liked a bit more cheese relative to the amount of meat though. The salmon and pesto struck me as oddities too - maybe swap those out for some grapes and chutney instead?  The service was very friendly with our waitress happy to have a bit of a chat when she brought the wine over, but otherwise I guess we were quite low-maintenance customers. We ended up spending more than we probably intended on drinks and snacks but then we kinda skipped lunch... ok never mind excuses, sometimes you just need good wine and cheese and this place delivered :)",

The amount of food for the price was good but the taste was horrible considering the price. Additionally, the service was bad",

Unfortunately it was all booked- we reserved a table for Saturday instead.   The location of the little restaurant is awesome, the interior is authentic Italian. The food was quiet good, we choose a boring wine (a shame - but our own fault), the service wasn't really there and the atmosphere unfortunately didn't live up to my expectations.   If I had more days, I would give it an extra shot, but that's not the case! Hope others will have a better service and done there a day where people spend more than1 hour on dinning.",

I definitely recommend you try this and add a bottle of wine! The mushroom risotto was a miss, I expected it to be much creamier.  It tasted like I was eating rice not risotto. The pomodoro and spaghetti & meatballs were simply \"ok\". The menu had  2 pages of wine selections which is always good for a wine enthusiast. Overall the service was good.",
