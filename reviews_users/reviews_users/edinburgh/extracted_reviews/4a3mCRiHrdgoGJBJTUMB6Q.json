Pizza Paradise is a fast food eaterie, where apart from pizza slices you can indulge yourself with a falafel, chicken burger or any fast food lunch item that could be found in any similar place. The staff is ok, although sometimes you have to prompt them for things like sauces, spices, etc. It is not the most clean place but for a quick and cheap lunch - it is ideal. Besides, you can always opt for a takeaway order and enjoy it under the sun in a quiet park opening views to beautiful sights or architecture.",

The only drawback is there is a lack of seating. Although some is provided at busy times there's not a chance! However, take away is a good option.",

I certainly didn't regret it, and while I think perhaps a whole pizza from here is a little bit too gluttonous even for me, a slice here and there is utterly fantastic.",

The salami pizza was hot, spicy and tasted very fresh! It did not look like it had been sitting there for days on end! On my other visit I tried a roll with a spicy chicken filling, the chicken was quite tender with a creamy sauce. All very nice!  Inside, the place is quite small and does have a limited amount of seating, but if you get a seat by the window, it is a great place to watch the countless number of people going by.   Pizza paradise is a great place to go during the day or after a night out, and the pizza is tasty and quite cheap...Perfect!",

The reason is simple- a HUUUUGE slice of pizza with a variety of toppings to choose from and a can of fizzy juice is around 2. The bargain of the century in my eyes. Its not just pizza though - Pizza paradice does all the other fair you may expect such as burger, kebabs, and really nice chicken pakora's. During the day the pizza tastes just as great, proving that there isnt some form of beer goggles for the taste buds.  There is however two problems - the ham and mushroom pizza is always the frist to go (shame as its the best) and Pizza paradice closes faaar too early.",

There's not really that much to separate the generic fast food takeaway places that you never seem to go to when you're sober, but if my heels will allow it I always tend to gravitate towards this one.  For starters, you get student discount on absolutely everything, as well as student-only promos like a huge pizza slice for only 1.50... absolute winner. The food is always cooked well (in other words, I've never got ill from one of their burgers/kebabs!) which is generally  more than can be said for a lot of places like this.   But what I think really swings it for me was the freezing january night when a friend and I were queuing out the door in the snow, to find that the staff were going along the queue handing out free chips to warm you up while you waited. You can't get any better than that. The only drawback? It's not open late enough!",

Of course I ate it, I was wasted. But I knew, deep down, that I was being made a fool. I knew I should have gone back to my apartment and eaten a frozen pizza because it would have been far and away more delicious.

Or even if they have, one thing has to be said about Pizza Paradise - it's far more memorable when drunk as a skunk. At two in the morning there is nothing better than toddling in here for a portion of chips and a great big dollop of soft pizza. It does the job of soaking up the alcohol and stops any frenzy about having to get up for a train back to Glasgow at early o clock with a blazing hangover.  It's simple, good old fashioned fast food. I've never been particularly drawn to coming in here with a clear head but that's not to say I wouldn't. I've always enjoyed a munch from Pizza Paradise and with their patient, efficient staff they do the trick at three in the morning!",

Perhaps some people eat here during the day at normal hours like lunch or dinner time, which is fair enough, but I think the doughy wares of Pizza Paradise are best enjoyed after midnight, as that's when the street party begins.  I have vivid (and at the same time blurry) memories of many a night out in the Grassmarket, in the days where I would take out 20 for the night and that would be it for drinks plus taxi fare. The 20 did not allow for the alcohol fuelled idea, and luxury, of buying a whole pizza to chomp on the way home. Therefore, my friends and I, some of whom were in the same predicament, would slyly socialise with many of the innocent pizza eaters standing outside the shop, who would then, more often than not, offer us some pizza, probably to get rid of us more than anything. The point of all this nostalgia is really to say that Pizza Paradise is brilliant for a post night out pizza fix, and very conveniently located on George IV Bridge.",
