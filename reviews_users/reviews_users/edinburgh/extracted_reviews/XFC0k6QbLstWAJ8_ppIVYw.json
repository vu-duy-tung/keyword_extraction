The service, the drinks, and the food. We got the imberico  ham and manchego cheese started and we split the two person seafood special. It was nothing short of perfection. Thank you for making our weekend perfect.",

    "text": "My wife and I visited Cadiz after reading a review on another website.  It turned out to be a very busy Tuesday evening as the University graduation ceremonies were in full swing - we didn't have a reservation.  The restaurant staff were very polite and managed to find us a table (we really should have called to make a reservation...).  I had oysters to start followed by the Cadiz version of 'fish, chips and mushy peas' while Jilly chose calamari and a fillet of sea bass - all of which was served piping hot (except the oysters), beautifully presented and really delicious.  We chose beer and a cocktail but there is a pretty comprehensive wine list - mostly Spanish.  All in all, we really enjoyed the Cadiz experience.  The staff greeting us on arrival and the waiting staff were very attentive, polite and friendly.  Five STARS Cadiz !",

    "text": "What a beautiful new spot for some great cocktails and seafood. You can make a reservation in advance - and you'll probably need it. Grab a craft cocktail or glass of wine at the bar while you wait, and prepare for some delicious seafood.  We were visiting Edinburgh and didn't expect to get so lucky with a new restaurant, but we really lucked out! The interior is beautifully designed and the vibe is modern and upscale. Dress a little nicer than jeans to come dine here.  Make sure if you have a nut allergy, you let your server know. The sol had hazelnuts in the breading, which couldn't be avoided, so we picked another entree.  Prices are moderate, but well worth it. Food is delicious and I can't imagine anything on the menu being less than superb!",

    "text": "Had an enjoyable meal after hearing some good reviews from a couple of friends. Love seafood and Cadiz didn't disappoint.   A nice selection - 90% fish based. A bit pricey but acceptable. Had a great asparagus/egg dish starter then monkfish/scallop main. Main was lovely but fish flavour was a bit lacking. Can't fault presentation and accompaniments. To finish off, had an amazing warm brownie/ice cream combo. This was perfection and a great way to finish.   Overall I would recommend Cadiz and would happily return for another meal anytime.  A nice addition to fish restaurants in Edinburgh.",

    "text": "Before heading out to Cafe Anduluz's new venture, Cadiz,  I did read a few reviews - all quite glowing so I went with fairly high expectations.  The restaurant is next door to Cafe Andaluz - on the first floor and I assume they share the same kitchen as quite a few things are similar - but with full size portions at Cadiz.  We were greeted at the bottom of the stairs with a friendly smile and made our way up to the smartly decorated restaurant.  They have the decor right.  A touch of nautical, but not tacky, smart but not stuffy.  Good start so far!  It's not very big and we were seated at a very small table in a corner.  The host did not give us menus at the time of being seated, so we waited for a waiter.  And waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Every time a waiter came near we made a little wave - but they didn't even look into our corner.  Finally the table next to us were getting their bill and 15 minutes after being seated, we were given menus and a sincere apology.  So, not off to a great start but we weren't in a hurry and if the food was good, then we wouldn't be bothered.  Looking over the menu I was a bit disappointed in the choices and high prices.  The reviews I had read all raved about the langoustines but, the price was very high for just a few.  I live close to Welches Seafood and can get langoustines at a third of the price, and they only need to be steamed so nothing cheffy. We decided to go for things that took a little more skill to prepare.  I ordered the calamari and the sole; my husband got the salmon and the scallops to start.  Both starters were very good and nice sized portions.  The mains weren't as satisfying. I was hoping for something along the lines of sole meuniere (which I have yet to master) but what I got was just pan fried with lots of butter.  No flour to give crispy bits, no browned butter to give depth of flavour, no wine to add an acidic bite.  Just butter, lemon to squeeze on myself and a few capers (the pics on their website show sole doused in capers, I got about 5 and they were the best bit).  The sole was tasteless.  Not fishy or bad, just nondescript.  And the sauce (pure butter) was just too greasy.  Every time I put my knife on the edge of the plate, it would slide into the centre and end up covered in butter, which then went all over my hands when I tried to pick up the knife.  The biggest disappointment with the sole and most of the mains, was that they were not cleverly put together meals, which I was expecting at this price level.  My sole came with fries.  No veg, just fries.  To give us some greens, we ordered the Pimiento de Padron.  I wish I had asked to swap the fries for new potatoes (which were on the sides menu).  Even better, they could state on the menu that you can have a choice of fries or potatoes.    The salmon was nice but again nothing really complicated to cook, and came with spicy, stewed chickpeas one of the only mains with sides built in.  The chick pears were very good; I would eat them on their own.  However, my husband was disappointed as the menu said they came with Chorizo and there was NONE to be found.  Desserts were basic but tasty.  The creme catalan (aka creme brulee) come 'flaming' which was a nice touch but I had to wait for the flame to go out to eat it!    When we received the bill, we were given a 10 discount for the long wait. A nice touch, and we were debating about a tip, so we were happy to add this back on and not have to give any more.    Our bill, with only water to drink was just over 80 with the discount.  For that, I would expect more highly crafted seafood meals, not just a piece of fish and some fries.  The nice starters and dessert, and apology for the long wait keep it in the high 3 stars.  A-OK but room for improvement.",

    "text": "Seafood and cocktails... advertises the new Cadiz restaurant on George street, the perfect combination on a sunny day! The restaurant is beautifully and freshly outfitted, a lovely bright welcome met us on the first floor with smart furniture, gorgeous big windows, Spanish style tiles and seaside decor. It's upmarket but has a casual friendly feel and the menu is seafood, Scottish and Spanish themed. We had a lovely welcome by staff and they remained attentive through our meal. For me any trip to a Spanish restaurant isn't complete without a plate of Iberian ham so we had a plate to start which was delicious, unfortunately not served with the traditional tomato bread but we had a lovely basket of artisan bread instead with sea salted paprika butter which was different and tasty! For main course I had the whole Scottish lobster with garlic butter and skinny fries. The lobster was cooked very well, moist and delicious but unfortunately swimming in garlic butter and although I enjoyed dipping my fries and bread into the garlicky goodness, next time I will ask for it on the side as it was just a was just a bit too much for my taste.  I also thought at 48 a bit on the steep side but it was a treat! My partner had surf and turf, nicely cooked steak with half lobster and salad which was delicious. We left room to share a cheeky desert and glad we did... Homemade praline cheesecake with salted caramel sauce washed down with a last glass each from the bottle of Gaudi's rose cava which was absolute treat and complimented all our courses very well. Overall a nice experience in a prime spot in town. I think these guys need to really ensure exceptional food and service to keep up with the other more established seafood restaurants in Edinburgh if they are to stay on the map. Nevertheless I would visit again and the restaurant is a welcome addition to the George street crew.",

We each ate one pepper and despite our high tolerance for spice, these peppers were painfully spicy and intolerable. It was clear that the chef hadn't even bothered to taste any from the batch. On top of that the food was bland. To all, stay away from this place.",
