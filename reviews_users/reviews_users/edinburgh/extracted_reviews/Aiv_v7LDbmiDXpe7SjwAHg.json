Recently refurbished, this McDonalds if a-ok.   But! What gets my goat about McDonalds is that at 2am on a Friday/Saturday night they entice you in by being the only food outlet open for miles. Well, what feels like miles when your drunk and feet hurt. So you go in and drunkenly order a pile of munch, then realise that when they are open late they bump the prices up by a fair whack. The cost of your post night out munch ends up costing more than your night out did in the first place!  Props for being open late over the weekend though.",

The line at the counters was several deep. Our experience went very well for a McDonalds. I would not normally rate a McDonalds but it deserved it due to the speedy delivery of our food. I'd give it a 3.5 if I could.",

    "text": "This branch of McDonald's is seriously, seriously annoying. For several reasons. Whether it's the constant flow of chavvy teenagers in hoodies clogging up the place, or having to climb up several flights of stairs to get to the main seating area, or having to use an entry code to use the toilets, you'll always encounter a problem of some sorts here.  This particular visit wasn't particularly great. I had to queue up for over 15 minutes among the chavs and then I went upstairs to find that all the seats were taken. After hanging around like a lemon for ages, I finally found a seat and tried to connect to the free O2 Wifi in the restaurant which didn't work.  My food was okay but it was a bit cold by the time I sat down to eat and my strawberry milkshake was liquidy and strong, as if the syrup hadn't been mixed  around properly.  After I finished eating, I wanted to use the toilet but I had to go get the entry code from the staff as I had misplaced my receipt. Why would they even bother putting codes on the doors if the toilets are all the way at the top of the stairs? It just makes it more inconvenient for people who may not know about the system.  I think I'll head over to the store in Waverley Mall or even the one up in the West End by House of Fraser from now on as this branch is just a huge pain in the arse.",

    "text": "It's McDonald's. In terms of the food, you know what you're going to get. This particular branch is fine. Unfortunately, it attracts a lot of loud, drunk people on Saturday nights, which I guess is to be expected, but is also typically the only time I go. Food is good. I usually ask for my burger without one ingredient, to make it more likely I'll get a fresh one. Staff are quite efficient, and I'm always in and out with little time wasted. It's greasy and unhealthy, but also cheap and cheerful. As Yelp says, this McDonald's is A-OK!",

Yes  It annoys me how people lie when they say they hate McDonalds and would never eat there. They do. Everyone does, and everyone secretly loves it. They're not the biggest fast food company in the world just by chance.",

    "text": "Had problems with this mcdonalds before, one was when my strawberry milkshake was not made properly and it was very strong, so I took it back. They tried to say it was fine when it clearly wasnt but took it back anyway. Then next time me and a couple of friends went to get a mccdonalds and my friend ordered a chicken burger. It was rock solid, clearly had been from the day before or just not cooked correctly, however she never ate it and wasted about 4 on nothing. To be honest though, most of the time the food is nice and enjoyable and would recomend going 3/5",
