This swanky restaurant is located on the B1 level of the Balmoral Hotel.    Pre-appetizer \"tastes\", appetizers, mains & desserts were all perfectly executed and deliciously tasty.  The petit fours topped off the meal... A dining extravaganza!  Highly recommended.  Beware, top notch dining comes at a top notch price but OK to splurge for that special occasion.  Just be sure to check that you have a sufficient credit line on your card before attempting to pay :)  Dinner for 2 with gratuity came to  240.",

We've had the tasting menu twice and both times it hit the mark.   They are happy to tailor the menu to special dietary requirements, and the adapted dishes are no less glorious than the originals (at least in my experience with the vegetarian options). The only thing I don't like at Number One is the art on the walls, but it's easy enough to ignore that and instead focus on the art on the plates.",

Went for the tasting menu/degustation (it was seventy pounds without wine, six more than the three course option) and it was absolutely fantastic - the scallop and steak were both stand-out favourites around the table.  Service, impeccable. One of my fellow diners is allergic to both caffeine and chocolate (yes, poor thing) and the staff at Number One happily worked around these allergies.  DO IT!

Meaty for my parents so everyone could enjoy   Pre-amuse busche - 4 delish little nibbles like pea mousse, beef tartare (for parents), tomato & radish, mozzarella phyllo   Amuse Busche- Butternut Squash Veloute & Mushroom Soup. Both were rich, thick, savory & creamy. Couldn't decide which was better   Starters - asparagus tempura w/ asparagus mousse & quail eggs, mushroom soup w/ summer truffle.....give me truffle on anything & it's a winner, no question!   Mains - sea bass w/ veggies thinly sliced for parents - said it was the best fish they had in the country   I enjoyed stuffed artichoke w/ cauliflower gratin, summer truffle & veggies tender & extremely flavorful - w/ walnut gnocchi was creamy & yummy & the gnocchi were the fluffiest little pillows of deliciousness. perfect tool for scooping up all that yummy walnutty creamy sauce!   Pre-Dessert of praline cheesecake & chocolate sauce   Desserts were raspberry souffle w/ choc macaroon; choc granitta was the lightest, fluffiest souffle I've ever had.   After dinner treat was 5 desserts like lemon Turkish delight, passion fruit sorbet bite, & little choc bites like choc hazelnut, choc mint, mini choc bomb   There was a travelling Scotch Cart, travelling Bread Cart ( which was phenomenal! ), everything travelled right to you.....and when you thought you should say no, it would be way too tempting & we'd find ourselves saying okay   They also had a travelling cheese cart that looked awfully tasty but by this point, there was *no way* we were getting even 1 crumble more into our tummies.....next time my Number One!   Number One was our #1 most expensive meal in Scotland - but totally worth it!",

Totally opposite experience to James O, so maybe they've stepped up their game since that review was posted.  We had three courses, and each one was interluded with a tasting style menu of canapes.  The bread and cheese trolley was out of this world, easily found in any artisan bakery.  The food was one of the best meals I've had in Edinburgh, every course was delicate and full of flavour.   The loss of one star is due to the atmosphere. It's a little pretentious. It has a dining room feel to it, however your fellow diners are banker types in suits, and the odd couple on a romantic date. We didn't feel as relaxed and made a move as soon as the bill was paid.",

    "text": "This was one of the worst restaurant meals of my life.  My fiance and I came here on a recommendation from our hotel, and after hearing how many Michelin stars this place had been awarded, we figured we were in for a fantastic meal.   Firstly, let me say that this restaurant has absolutely no atmosphere.  It's incredibly stuffy and just generally very old-world, whilst simultaneously trying not to be. That being said, I wouldn't have really minded had the meal been enjoyable.  The meal started with several canapes that didn't seem to go together, much less taste good on their own.  I had a feeling after tasting the foie gras macaroon that the meal was only going to be down hill from there. Nevertheless, I tried to maintain an open mind.  However, each dish that they brought us proved to be one let down after the next.  By the end of the meal, I was so looking forward to dessert - but even the souffle was horrendous.  We have eaten at restaurants all over the world, and never have we had a recommendation that proved to be such a massive let down.  We had a far more enjoyable meal the following night at Ondine. This restaurant needs to make up it's mind (and replace the carpet).   Will be shocked if they get a Michelin star for 2013.",

    "text": "Number One is the Balmoral Hotel's Michelin starred restaurant, which in itself gives you an indication that the food here is going to be far greater than your average hotel restaurant fare. Michelin Star handouts in Edinburgh are few and far between, so if you get the chance to have a culinary experience in any such starred establishment, I would free up a space in the diary.  Number One sits quietly in its prime Princes Street position, not doing anything too outlandish or showy, but making a classy impression, which mixes tradition with style. The consistently tasty dishes are classic in execution, but with a modern twist, so you're not in danger of those unimpressed looks some dining companions give to modern, tiny food, which is sometimes almost unidentifiable because it's been so artistically tampered with. The ambience here is smooth and relaxed, and there's very little chance you'll be disappointed.",

    "text": "I was lucky enough to eat here as part of a Youth Food Week run by Michelin starred restaurants in Edinburgh. Two of our university lecturers took 9 of us here for dinner (they didn't pay) and it was a very memorable experience. The menu was a set three course menu at 27.50 a head with wine pairings for each course. I doubt there will be many times I will eat at a Michelin star restaurant for such a low price with as much wine as we wanted included in the price!   The duck starter was heavenly and for the main course I had the most amazing steak I have ever eaten. Of course it wasn't just a big lump of sirloin, it was all fancied up in ways I didn't understand, but it was out of this world. The only downfall was the dessert which was a chocolate pudding thing which was far too sweet for me. I normally munch down a dessert in record timing, but I couldn't eat it all because it was too much for me. I felt jealous of my neighbours interesting cheese board!  Despite the fact we were eating on the cheap in such a fancy restaurant, the staff couldn't have done enough for us and treated us like we were normal paying customers. The Chef even came out for a chat. The restaurant is beautiful and comfortable. I really would love to eat here again and again and again.",

    "text": "Time to get my snobbery on.  Again yelp you have hit the hammer on the head of the nail with the \"Meh. I've experienced better\".  Number One is the place you go if you have lots of money, and want people to see you.  Nice decor that is open despite being underground.    My lovely date (Jeanne) and I, are on a quest to try all the creme a la creme places of Edinburgh, and Number One was next on the list.    And perhaps I should start off by stating that my rating is terribly harsh, and the only reason really, is because they are not delivering what should be in the price.  We arrived, (reservations are suggested) while we were there, we represented 22% of the people.  Bread trolly was surprisingly uncreative, with much of the standard rolls one could find at a good bakery; butter was nice and fresh, and our starters were fine.  My goats cheese was overly mild and wasn't distinct, but was very soft and fresh.    Jeanne and I both ordered the hay beef with marrow and rib with a truffle glaze.  Her, rare, me medium rare.  Now come the mistakes, and I really don't mean to get too snobby, but when one pays the prices one pays, you don't make mistakes.  Our total bill came to more than half my months rent (Marchmont rent) for a dinner for two, 3 courses and 1 glass of wine each.  1.) Waitress served me wrong wine.  She later notified me of her mistake, however charges were still on bill of the more expensive wine.  2.) Jeanne and I's meat were both served the same, i.e. both rare.  Also the truffle glaze was impossible to taste, and left us wondering if it had been forgotten.  3.) Jeanne, being from France (and from a respectable background), is use to having her silverware placed in a specific way with the fork facing down, not up as is customary in this country.  After the waiter had place her cutlery down, she and I both flipped it in her \"french style\".  When the waiter came to refill our glasses he changed it back.  Jeanne and I both changed it again, with again the waiter returning it to the british way.  While Jeanne and I both found this \"silent\" battle to be very amusing, it violates a crucial rule that Number One seems to believe they are above.  The Customer is always right.",

    "text": "On our first night in Edinburgh, we ate at the lovely Number One restaurant in The Balmoral hotel. The decor is a bit odd. There is a lot of artwork on the wall (and two that we were sitting next to that were half below our table), and they seemed quite eclectic in style. Some we really enjoyed, others seemed quite bizarre.  That being said, we were seated at our table and given the menus to look at. We were on a package deal which included the tasting menu, so we had that of course with the wine pairings.   The first fun thing was the bread trolley that they wheeled up to your table. There were three types of bread: a spelt baguette, cheese bread, and a rosemary bread. The breads were sliced for you at the table, and the bread slicer gave you the option of the end of the loaf (if that's your thing... it certainly is mine so I took him up on the offer). We were also served a few delicious bites at the beginning.   To be honest, it was hard not to compare some of the courses to some we had at Andrew Fairlie a few days earlier, since both of the meals contained foie gras and scallops. The seared foie gras was amazing (better than the foie gras at Andrew Fairlie). It was decadent and having a bit of truffle with it was just the icing on the cake. The scallops course was also slightly tastier. It wasn't as refined, but the flavors were out of this world.  For the rest of the courses, I wasn't overly excited about the cheese mouse that came between the foie gras and the scallops. Nothing wrong with it, but a tad boring (for me). The beef was cooked well, and it came with tongue and sweetbreads! I'm definitely an offal sort of guy, so this was very nice. The dessert was good. A bit chocolately and a good way to end things.  We opted for the additional cheese course, and I'm glad we did. There was a huge selection of cheeses available, and while the cheese man was willing to give us a plate to share, we got our own (mostly because I love goat cheese, and well, the other half hates it). We were both quite happy with the selections we had with the cheese.  The meal was really tasty. Maybe not quite as refined or interesting as some of the other places I've been, but everything was well cooked and enjoyable.",

It was quite intimidating, since I was eating alone at such a nice place, but the service staff was welcoming and attentive. Although the menu items were listed as five course meals, they allowed me to order and pay for a few individually.   I was just looking for a cheese board and a nice glass of wine, but ended up trying the foie gras (why not? I thought. never tried it before...). It was pretty pricey, but I was paying with my monopoly money (foreign cash). I loved the bread, and the little tasty treats they served before and after the meal (the official name escapes me).

    "text": "The mission of my moment is michelin dining!     I'd been dying to visit Number One Restaurant for ages and they are not normally open for lunch, but they do open for a few dates in December for festive dining at a very reasonable price of 35pp for 3 courses with coffee and petit fours.  I'd noticed this last year so had a mental note to book ourselves in this year for a pre-christmas treat and well, treat is an understatement!   It was fabulous, so much so, I want to move in!  Going downstairs, you enter a bit of the unknown as you can't see from the outside what its like, but you find yourselves welcomed into a very cosy bar area where coats are taken from you and you are seated in the lounge bar.   Nice touch to have a pre-lunch drink whilst you peruse the menus.   We had a glass of champagne and shortly after our lunch and wine orders were taken. We were then left to relax with drinks until our table was ready and escorted through just before the starters arrived.  Lovely table for 2.  One thing I like in this restaurant is there is plenty space, so you have your own little oasis.  Lovely big comfy chairs, you can be seated a while, so give into the experience and enjoy it  :o)  Starters - for me it had to be the Crab, Red Pepper Espuma, Avocado, Tomato, Crispy Squid whilst my boy had the Maple Glazed Pork Belly, Surf Clams, Broccoli, Chorizo, Apple Salad.  I have to say, this menu had me really torn!  I wanted to try it all, really tough choices.   My starter of crab was delicate, light and refreshing and loved the crispy squid, perfect.   The pork belly was apparently delightful and the boy could have eaten more, not that the starter was inadequate in size, just he loved it so much.   We normally give each other a wee taste of what the other has, but not this time, it was finders keepers!!  Main courses - we both opted for Roast Pheasant Breast, Slow Cooked Leg, Leek Puree, Herb Jus   OMG, fabulous!  First time I've had pheasant and I'm in love with a bird!!  Lots of oohs and ahhs whilst eating this.  At the end of this course, we both looked at each other, there was some telepathy going on, can we lick the plates!?  The jus on the pleasant was delicious, and if I'd been at home, my bread would have been mopping it up, but this not the sort of place to be doing bread mopping.  Dessert - another tough choice - I love cheese and I love pudding, I really wanted both, but as the boy decided to have the cheese, I thought I'll have a dessert and sneak some cheese off his plate! So there we have it, Sea Buckthorn & Chocolate Trifle, Pear Williams Sorbet.  The coolness of the pear sorbet against the chocolate was refreshing and light and as trifle goes, this was good, not sickly at all and loved the biscuit crunch in it, compared to the usual sponge.  Yummy.   The boy's cheese plate, oh yes, I had a taste and it had one of the best goats cheeses I've ever tasted.  All served with lots of delicious oatcakes and biscuits.  Last but not least, your choice of tea or coffee and petit fours.   Throughout our meal, warm baked bread, water and wine was re-filled as many times and the service was welcoming, friendly, excellent from start to finish!  I wish wish wish I had could have taken photographs of our food.  Aside the taste, the presentation is fabulously pretty, but phones are a definite no no in this restaurant and quite right so.  I'm afraid, you're just going to have to go and dine here, to get the full experience and I hope that you have as good a time as we had.  Same time next year, we've already ear marked a date for December 2012 to go again, if not before, to try out the dinner menu when we are feeling a bit more flush!",

Their reservations staff are not great - when we made the room reservation, we also booked the restaurant - with quite a few e-mails back and forth.  When we got there, they had made our reservation in their sort of dinky bistro restaurant, not the nice one.  So we tried to change it and were told that there were absolutely no tables available.    When we went down for dinner, my husband said \"let's just look in on the nice restaurant and see if they have a table\"  I am so glad we did as the place was about half empty ,AND STAYED THAT WAY, which is too bad if others missed out on a wonderful meal.  The chef uses local, Scottish ingredients, so the menu changes.  Everything was deliciously prepared, elegantly served, and interesting without being odd or overwhelming.  We had a wonderful meal and found the service attentive and pleasant.  Like the hotel it is in, it is not cheap, but unlike the hotel, it is worth the price.",

We couldn't believe how complex and absolutely delicious every single thing was. (We did the tasting menu + wine pairing.) Lastly, and maybe most importantly these days...the service. Absolutely impeccable. Our wine was always perfectly timed with our food. The level of finessed collaboration was impressive. Everyone was extremely knowledgeable about what we were eating - not just a couple of people. We loved that there were only a few different types of bread to choose from (vs 8, for example!) We felt like Number One is just the way a very fine restaurant should be. Particularly a Michelin starred restaurant. It was divine. A wonderful, special treat that exceeded our expectations. Thank you for such a special and delicious evening.",

This is a fancy restaurant, with multi course meals, excellent service and a price tag to match.   We ordered the tasting menu and 1 drink each and the total came out to around 230 pounds.  The smoked salmon and Scottish hogget (lamb) were the two stand outs for me.    I mean it was an enjoyable meal but to be honest as far as high end dining experiences go it was not particularly memorable ymmv.  If you are in Edinburgh and can stomach the prices than it's a good option, if you can't, you ain't missing all that much  Solid but not amazing,  which to to be honest is a lot more than you can say for many other high end restaurants :P",

First on our list was to try Scotland famous dish, haggis. It was such a hype built around this that we couldn't wait to try it. It was surprisingly good and if you were blindfolded what it tasted like was a peppery stuffing at Thanksgiving.   We also ordered the Sunday special which was called Gammon. That's ham in America. It was served with sweet cabbage and these balls that look like hush puppies and that is what Scotts call stuffing.  It's always a little bit wobbly learning how the service works and how tipping works but we managed to get through it....with the help of a local dark Stout ale.",

Food-- we started with squab pigeon and the Dingwall scallops, dinner was Scottish beef fillet and east Lothian lobster, and we finished with a couple truffles off the sweets cart. Complimentary bites included an amuse-bouche and a small tray of savory pastries at the beginning our our meal. Wine selection was good.   My favorite part of the meal was the squab pigeon appetizer. I wish there had been a main course option-- it was amazing! I love game birds, and that dark meat with sliced truffle was a dynamite combination. My Scottish beef fillet dish was decadent, served with a dark cream sauce, morel mushrooms and foie gras-- delicious! My husband's lobster was cooked perfectly. Everything was spot on, as expected of a Michelin restaurant.   But as someone who has experienced some pretty good meals in her life, I'm not sure that the food fully justifies the price point. That is to say, I'm really glad we dined at the Number One, but nothing makes me pine to return, especially for that kind of money.",

In Number One, the experience really lived up to the restaurant's name. Food was excellent and plentiful, might I add. Dishes were creative and had verity of ingredients. The bread service, which I do not normally partake in, was phenomenal. Probably best bread I have had in my life. It was hard not to overindulge in fact.  I did not elect to have the wine tasting with my meal as the rest of my colleagues had. Half way through the dinner however, I was so intrigued by the sommelier and his wonderful stories, that I wanted to try some wines. He was glad to bring me a glass and offered a tasting at every step thereafter.  The sommelier was one of the best I have had the pleasure to meet. He was not only knowledgeable, but kept our attention by telling us detailed narratives of each wine and reasons why he selected them to accompany the meal. At the end of our dining experience, he wrote down the wines for us to have. I wish I remembered his name to commemorate him here, but I did not. He really was fantastic and made the dinner that much more special.  This was fantastic experience and meal!",

I had made a reservation for 6 people but two family members showed up in Edinburgh as a surprise and the restaurant could accommodate us even though I changed to 8 people 3 hours before our dining.  Excellent service from the time we entered the door. The summer tasting menu was fantastic and an extra plus for making mine dairy free (which I had informed of when reserving the table). The wine pairing and the sommelier's info of the wines was perfect. Without a doubt one of the best tasting menus and dining experiences we've had!

    "text": "In my opinion, there are three key areas that work together to make a dining experience what it is: the setting, the service and the food. Normally scoring highly in any two of those three areas will give you a better than average dining experience, but every now and then you are lucky enough to experience all three at a their peak and that results in a truly remarkable experience, and this is exactly what happened when we had dinner at Number One.   From the moment you step into the space you enter a tranquil ( not boring) space that is ideal for a romantic dinner, or any special occasion. The music is excellent and never intrusive, the perfect soundtrack to your evening.   The service is attentive and exacting, and the staff are engaging, welcoming and extremely knowledgeable, which makes you feel right at ease.   As for the food - whether you go for the a la carte menu or the tasting menu I don't think you can go wrong. We had the veloute and foie gras to start and the lamb and grouse for mains, and I won't bother to detail the dishes other than to say that they all were detailed, complex (in the sense that there were many components working together) and utterly delicious. Seriously well put together food.  And I didn't even mention the complimentary amuse bouche or the deserts which were of the same standard and are a delight for the senses.   All in all I can honestly say that our dinner at Number One was easily one of, if not the, best meals we have ever eaten.   Now, you get what you pay for and it isn't cheap, but if you find yourself in this amazing city and want a truly exquisite dining experience, I cannot recommend this enough.",

    "text": "My partner and I are in mutual agreement. This is the best meal we've ever eaten in our lives.   Let me take you through this epic culinary journey from start to finish. I booked a place three months in advance for my partners birthday just to secure our place.   Upon arrival, we walked down a flight of stairs to get to Number One. We were greeted by one staff member who took our coats, then another who led us through the dining room than another who say us down. Oh and another serving water and another serving canapes.   I have to admit I was a bit apprehensive before going in because ultra fancy is usually not my style. I was worried whether I was dressed well enough and whether I'd know which cutlery to use and when. Well, I didn't need to worry about that at all! Despite its five star status everyone was welcoming and friendly. Not an air of doucheyness or pretentiousness in sight.   So we were provided three canapes each upon sitting and offered aperitifs. When my partner asked for the selection of whiskey, well, they just bought the whole tray over!   So after some general chit chat and a brief look at the menu (as if I didn't check beforehand!) we ordered the 7 courses with tasting wines.   So our seven course dinner became a four hour event where we ate, laughed, and learnt about an array of amazing wines, each perfectly paired with our meals.   The amuse bouche to start was a small amount of lobster, perfectly cooked and seasoned with grilled cucumber which blew my mind.   Next came the balmoral smoked salmon with lemon curd, caviar and a quail egg. My partner has named this \"the best dish I have ever eaten.\" Enough said, even of you don't go with a 7 course meal just coming for the salmon will change your life.   Next up the heritage beetroot. Sweet, soft, salty and crunchy this was a curious dish topped with a dijon mustard icecream.   So by now we were three  glasses of wine in a safe to say, I'm feeling pretty giggly by this point.   Then came the wild halibut atop boiled potatoes. Seriously the best fish I have ever eaten in my whole life. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned, really delicate and perfectly paired with the Ataraxia Chardonnay.   Then the main: aged beef fillet with mushroom and a truffle jus. This meal was quite strong in comparison to the others had, but was cooked to perfection and was so tender.   We were then offered the selection of cheeses which we gladly accepted. We were quite full by this point, but who am I to pass up cheese and fortified wine?  We then had the pre-dessert, which was a mix of strawberry and watermelon to cleanse the palette.   Dessert was a caramel souffle cooked to perfection with pecan and banana. Paired with an amazing port with undertones of toffee which paired well with the dish.   This was truly an amazing experience I would do again in a heartbeat. The cost of this meal was not cheap, but if you can spare the  then this is a must try.   The dining room was spacious with ample room, far enough from other diners so you can fully immerse yourself in all these culinary delights.   The staff were do professional and friendly and at times it was like watching a dance- the timing and graceful way they moved around the dining room seemed effortless. Our sommelier was extremely knowledgeable and each wine complimented each dish perfectly.   I cannot reccomend Number One highly enough, it was a truly unforgettable experience.",

It was not just the well-crafted food that made for a lovely evening, but the delightful staff and atmosphere added tremendously to my experience.   I am not going to go into great detail to describe this experience, others have amply documented the triumph of Number One. Instead, I am going to give you some advice:  If you are in Edinburgh... GO TO NUMBER ONE WITH SOMEONE YOU LOVE AND SHARE A FOUR HOUR EXPERIENCE WITH THEM! IT WILL BE SOMETHING  YOU NEVER FORGET.  Thanks,  JA  P.S There is an outstanding establishment just up the street from Number One with a wide selection of scotch and beer.",

Each table is far enough away that you are not a part of someone else's conversation. The menu is challenging but not so far out of most people's comfort zones. The ingredients are absolutely fresh and combined in such a way that the flavor of each stands out in every dish. The staff is courteous and professional and the Sommelier is exemplary. He is knowledgeable and flexible in adjusting selections to your individual tastes. The food is delicious and well portioned. I would expect no less at an establishment of this quality. We had the seven course tasting menu with premier wine pairing and it was lovely. The wine pairings were not a nice addition to meal, the pairings elevated the meal from great to memorable. Will definitely re-visit",

    "text": "A really lovely dinner for two from start to finish.   We had the set tasting menu with wine pairings, all of which beautifully complemented each course they were served with. Waitstaff also shared a short bit of information on the background of each pairing beyond the usual types of flavors, acidity, etc... one could expect.  When I ordered I asked if it was possible to replace one course with a John Dory (with langoustine and smoked bacon) I saw on the a la carte menu, because I hadn't had excellent John Dory in a while. Easily accommodated and as expected that course was outstanding as well.   My personal favorite courses were foie gras (perfectly seared, silky and buttery), the aforementioned John Dory and beef, which was easily among the best I'd ever tasted in terms of quality and ideal level done-ness.   If you enjoy cheese courses, Number One has top-notch cheese offerings, including many Scottish varieties. Try as many as you can!   It was a lovely, memorable evening thanks to the excellent food and service and I hope to return soon.",

I expected more from Number One and thought I was going to give it five stars. That said, my friends have given Number One a second chance and reported improvements in the tasting menu. I'd probably give it another try.",
