I had a great experience here:   I booked a 6:30 reservation for 3, but we showed up early around 5:40 just to check the place out. We were unaware that they didn't open till 6, but the staff was so friendly and brought us over anyways and let us order our food and drinks early.    I ordered the pumpkin gnocchi for dinner and the chocolate ganache for dessert. Both were incredible! I would definitely go back!",

Staying at the hotel we decided to try out the breakfast here. The breakfast served was outstanding: plenty of options with freshly baked breads, fresh fruit and juices, lemon juice. They also had hot breakfast options from which I ordered the omelet with ingredients of my choice and it was made the perfect way. The food was presented nicely too and was delicious. The service was excellent in a nice atmosphere. Recommended this to my friends too who tried this the next day and they were impressed too.",

Nice atmosphere, good service and the food was excellent. I had butternut risotto, which was very good but the zucchini fritte side was to die for!!! OMG!!! Really a great meal. There's a small outside terrace too, if weather permits.",

We are staying at the hotel and found breakfast to be quite nice, but the dinner was just awful.   The endive salad was bizarre. We couldn't identify some of the ingredients. I've had better pasta from Chef Boyardee. And the tiramisu consisted only of store bought lady fingers, cocoa powder, whipped cream and amaretto.  Our server was wonderful and apologetic. We didn't complain but he comped out pasta when we didn't finish. He could tell we weren't happy.",

Dinner 2 stars: Average food. The rabbit ragu was very salty. I've only been once and haven't returned since - not a high priority on my list.",

    "text": "Don't know how it survives except that it's down about a block from the castle  Was at castle and it was raining  My husband and I left to find something hot to eat to warm up. After checking out the menu out side the entry to cucina and it looked good There was Only one other couple  dining ( it was lunch hour) there was several employees standing around and a photographer taking photos of nice looking food Anyway , we were not greeted at the door we had to approach  them  It took over 5 minutes to just get a menu  I asked for a glass of Pino Grigio ( Italian restaurant) and was told that they don't have Pino Grigio  by the glass , that they only have Italian wines. The manager or maybe he was the owner was summoned by the waitress . He told me they only serve Pino Grigio  by the bottle  But that he could recommend another wine - great recommendation , I liked the wine  We realized most likely the service was going to continue to be bad and we didn't have all day so we decided to just get a quick bowl of soup and then go somewhere else  We ordered 2 bowls of Minestrone soup and  my husband wanted hot tea and we asked to ice water we were asked if we wanted sparkling and we said no just flat regular water No kidding about 10 minutes later they came with water and bread . I asked about the tea which then took at least another 5 minutes - it took about another 20 minutes for our soup to get to the table . I don't know why it took so long because the soup seemed to be hot water with semi thawed frozen carrots & peas, lots of diced onions& celery and some kind of undercooked dried beans   My husband ate his and I couldn't eat mine . No one asked how it was , We asked for the check and when we got it I explained that the soup was horrible . When our check came I couldn't believe the total bill was 38 pounds . They charged us for water And speaking of water , I'd swear the so called soup was just hot water with stuff thrown in ! Glad we did not order a whole meal ...",

I went for lunch - set menu (2 course for 15) and really enjoyed both meals - although was not fond of the dessert the first time (tiramisu) so opted for a starter the second time.  So! For lunch - both times, it was pretty quiet.  We were seated quickly.  Both times, service was a little slow, but not from the kitchen which was fast (the waiter at one point mentioned they aimed for both courses in 45 minutes), taking orders, getting the bill etc was slow.  Not that I minded but  - I suggest if you are in a hurry for lunch - tell them so that they wait on a you a little quicker!  Decor! Well - for me, it's too busy! There are lots of stripes, zigzags and dots - which I'm sure are lovely for some - but actually at time made me dizzy! Ooops.  Heartily recommend and am now really looking forward for an occasion to go for dinner!",

    "text": "This place just takes itself a little too seriously.  I like nice decor and surroundings just as much as anyone else when I go to a restaurant, but I really don't need to read about who designed it/what fabric they used for it/where this particular cushion was imported from in the menu. By definition, when I open the menu it's because I'm hungry and I want to eat.  After all their obsessive descriptions about every aspect of every single item that was within a mile radius of the restaurant, I couldn't help but suspect that they were doing it to dazzle you so much that you wouldn't notice if the food was mediocre. And it turned out I was right. I have no doubt that the ingredients were all grown especially for them and probably flown in on a private jet or something equally ridiculous, but there are so many other great food places along George IV bridge that I did feel a bit ripped off.  Being part of the Hotel Missoni, people will always eat here. Mainly because of it's reputation and because it's the kind of place that you can name-drop. But unfortunately the quality and style of Missoni clothes doesn't transfer to their hotel restaurants.",

This emperor's-new-clothes fusion of patterns is a lot of hipster lite claptrap. The food, though, is top-drawer Italian, made and served by the paisani.  They made a beautiful Risotto Milanese and a potato-parmesan stuffed ravioli with a black truffle butter sauce that were foundational elegance della Cucina Italiana.  Bring sunglasses and enjoy the food. The hipsters will just think you're famous.  Reservations are best, or the host will ask you how fast you can mangia before he fills the table again.",

    "text": "Everything about Hotel Missoni is newly stylish, immaculately finished, and trimmed with an edge of slightly eccentric fun, including Cucina, the Italian restaurant that makes up part of the hotel.  This is definitely a classy Italian dining experience, where you're served by smooth Missoni clad waiters, who are the kind of waiters that seem to glide along quietly doing their thing, not interfering too much with your meal, but making sure that everything is attended to nonetheless.  I had freshly made penne pasta with a pork ragu sauce, which was fantastic and full of flavour, followed by a good old glass vessel of Tiramisu, very much on the coffee tasting side of things, rather than the sweeter edge served up in some restaurants, and really, really good. This restaurant gets a no hesitation recommendation from me, although strangely for a Thursday night, normally a fairly busy evening in town, the restaurant seemed pretty quiet. Probably just a one off, because town didn't really seem that busy anyway on that particular evening, and sometimes it's better to have a bit of peace and quiet while you have some quality pasta and parmesan time.",
