    "text": "I woke up with another hangover this morning (it is the festival after all). One of those rotten, throbbing hangovers. A 'thick head' I like to call it. The kind where all you want to do is eat something hearty and unhealthy. So I took a wander into Morningside.   No I don't want a brie and cranberry bagel. Neither do I want a pan au chocolat and a latte. And I absolutely do not want parmesan and rocket foccacia drizzled with extra virgin olive oil. I want a fry up. A massive greasy fry up. And then I found the Yellow Cafe.  Now it would be completely unfair to describe this place as a greasy spoon. It absolutely is not. It's much more refined than that. What it is, though, is an unpretentious, family-run local cafe, selling simple, home-made food.  They put a Mediterranean twist on things, but that's OK because they do it well. My breakfast was great. Good music too. Back to bed now.",

One small negative: the furniture, although new and clean, does not feel very warm and welcoming but this is a minor detail, perhaps eventually some more solid wooden furniture would complete the experience.",
