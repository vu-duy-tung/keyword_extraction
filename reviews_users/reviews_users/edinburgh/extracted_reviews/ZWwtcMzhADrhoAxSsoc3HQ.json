Wanting to experience Scotland/UK culture in all its culinary opportunities..high tea where the Queen has it...seemed right!  It was a treat and it was very good! They start you with a full glass of champagne then you pick your tea type; they bring a beautiful tea pot out with the tea leaves in it and hot water.. steeping as you eat. Be for-warned the champagne is NOT part of the tea experience and they don't tell you that when they offer it... and it was the most expensive champagne we ever had! Next comes a little taste of a soup in a tiny tea cup.  Our 1st tower of food was all savory treats.. two of each so we both try the same items. Though they appear small in size they were full of flavor.. delicate and good!  Then another full glass of champagne (again, you'll pay).... Next we were brought a tower of sweet treats...again small but rich in flavor. More champagne offered but we still needed to find our way back to our hotel..lol! (Thank goodness or we'd be washing dishes!) Lastly a taste of a sorbet to refresh out palate! Lovely experience!",

If you've never experienced afternoon tea in the U.K., this is the place in Edinburgh. Service, presentation, taste, atmosphere -- everything was impeccably executed. The staff makes you feel so special.   My suggestion is that you don't eat before you get here. Though little, these tiny bites add up. From the soup course, to the savory tea stand, to the sweet tea stand, and then finally the palate cleanser-- with all the tea you can drink-- you'll feel like you need to be rolled out the door afterward. Every element was so beautifully crafted. If you are staying or live nearby, though, they're more than happy to send you off with a box to take leftovers home.   I really hope to be able to experience this again. My husband and I had so much fun. We were on our honeymoon in Scotland and afternoon tea at the Colonnades made it so much more special.",

From the amuse bouche which was a Thai sweet potato soup to savoury followed by sweet trays and finishing off with a sorbet to the impeccable service. I can not recommend a better way to treat yourself while visiting Edinburgh. Not only is there a fine selection of teas but they also offer champagne and cocktails. They also accommodated me as a pescatarian with equally delicious options. We were also told by one of our servers that the Queen of England herself just had tea at the Colonnades this month. If the Colonnades is good enough for the Queen it most certainly is good enough for me.",

And let me tell you, I cannot imagine a better place to have done so. The whole experience of the Colonnades, tucked away inside a library building right off the Royal Mile, was simply divine and decadent in the best possible way. I strolled in and used the lavish bathroom while I waited to be escorted into the library and seated. I was solo and given a nice table tucked away in a little outlet by a window. The entire dining area is within a lovely library. The staff is wonderful, kind, and attentive. The tea began with a lovely bit of cream soup and serving of the tea, delicious strawberry. Then came out the savory tower. Loved that they provided separate towers. Definitely you preference over scones, sandwiches, and pastries all being in one tower. The little bites and sandwiches were absolutely fabulous. Then a little sorbet palette cleanser. I loved all the little touches! It really was a full, unique experience. And the sweet tower certainly didn't disappoint. Yum!! Minimal on the scones but heavenly bites indeed. Overall I enjoyed every minute and every morsel, anyone looking for a wee, relaxing break in a busy day of touring, take some tea at the Colonnades. Simply wonderful.",

    "text": "Having skipped out on afternoon tea experience during our last trip to UK, we decided to make this trip count and \"went big\". The Colonnades did not disappoint. The day we are in Edinburgh was especially cold (though I'm a Californian weak sauce), so it was perfect to spend the afternoon in such an elegant setting. This is basically a 4 course experience, starting with an amuse bouche, a set of savory snacks, a set of sweet snacks, then end of with a palate cleansing dessert. It seems that their food changes often so I won't go into the specific, but all the food was elegantly and freshly made, taste amazing! Another differentiation is their amazing tea selection, with a great Asian tea selection. On top of everything, their service was great, and they often check to make sure you don't need to refill on your tea. Overall, afternoon tea can't get better then the food and setting here. Absolutely recommend it for anyone who's looking for a great experience.",

The afternoon tea itself is separated into savoury and sweet and you are also allowed unlimited tea and coffee. The food is presented very delicately on high quality silver platters and is importantly, very tasty. While you may not think you'll leave feeling full when you first see the size of each of the bites, trust me, you will be satisfied.   They also cater very well for vegetarians as long as you let them know at the time of booking - if you want a high class afternoon tea at a reasonable price, definitely visit Colonnades!",

    "text": "I love going for afternoon tea but if you are looking for a seriously indulgent afternoon tea experience, you need to visit Colonnades. It is seriously impressive.   Set within the beautiful Signet library, you are served up a four course afternoon tea in the most beautiful surroundings. None of the tables are too close to each other and everything is beautiful - you are made to feel very special and treated to a little bit of luxury.   Two waiters attended to us during our visit. We booked the afternoon tea online which was 25.00 each (it is usually 30.00) and on arrival, we found out that this included UNLIMITED TEA. You could literally try as many different pots of tea as you like (and they encourage you to do so and be creative!). And if you are not a a tea lover, this also includes coffee and hot chocolate.   The first course was a small cup of onion & thyme soup. I thought this sounded a little strange, but wow - it was one of the best things I have ever tasted! Creamy, delcious and the perfect portion size.   The savoury stand arrived next with plenty of amazing treats to choose from. Think that beetroot meringue doesn't work? THINK AGAIN! It was so beautiful and the small beef wellingtons were equally as tasty. There was also a gorgeous savoury cheesecake topped with pesto which I could have eaten all day. Again, portion control was perfect!  The sweet stand was what my friend and I were eagerly waiting on and we were not disappointed. An eclair that tastes of parma violets?! It happened! There was a beautiful champagne jelly that was just melt in the mouth. There was far too much and our waiter very kindly agreed to box up my leftover treats to I could take them home. And they didn't just come in a simple box - they were boxed and placed in a lovely reusable bag making them so easy to carry around. PERFECT!   And finally, the experience was ended with a lovely lemon sorbet that cleansed the pallet and just rounded off a beautiful afternoon.   Offering me unlimited tea probably isn't the best thing to do. I tried the Signet Blend which was beautiful and very much like a strong version of Tetley. The Jasmine tea was really nice too. I wanted to try more tea but I was literally full which is a pity. All of the teas are served in gorgeous teapots with separate strainers which I did want to take home with me - everything was so beautiful!!   At the surrounding tables, couples were enjoying a romantic afternoon tea and families were celebrating milestone birthdays. I completely understand why they chose to visit Colonnades. The staff do an exceptional job and nothing is too much trouble. If there was a way to give 6 stars, I would immediately! I cannot wait to visit Colonnades again.",

Located just a stone's throw away from the historic Royal Mile of Edinburgh lies the Colonnades tea room, set within the beautiful Signet Library. There's a real sense of occasion when you take Afternoon Tea at Colonnades - as you walk through the hall the main room opens up before you with beautiful Corinthian columns towering above diners, and old books lining the walls and galleries, handwoven carpets and mirrored tables reflecting the ceiling detail. It really does feel a very special and awe inspiring place for tea!  The recently opened Colonnades tea salon is part of Heritage Portfolio's collection of stunning venues. Their afternoon tea will be served year round alongside light lunches and cakes, and the menu will change seasonally depending on what is available, often featuring produce grown by the team in their gardens in Leith.  Starting with the tea - there is a good selection on the menu with their own Signet blend too, not to mention coffee and alcoholic choices too. Fans of last year's Pommery champagne bar will be relieved to hear there is still a huge choice of champagne and cocktails on the menu. I tried a Lapsang Souchong and as the refills are free I also tried a Russian Caravan blend which smelled like a summer evening by a campfire! The staff were so welcoming and friendly offering suggestions on the teas and patiently explaining every course in detail.  The Colonnades afternoon tea is slightly different to many I have had. They have made as much effort with the savoury course as they have the sweet. Each course is treated as a full course in its own right. The Savoury course arrived all on its own with three tiers, yes all three tiers, of beautifully presented goodies including an Aberdeen Angus mini burger on brioche bun, a flaky hot cheese tart with caramelised onions, fruity mini prawn cocktail with mango salsa and a Shetland Salmon tartare on oatcakes.  I thought it couldn't get any better after the savouries but then the sweet course arrived with another three tiers of deliciousness! My favourites included an incredible mini lemon meringue tart, a passion fruit eclair and a mille feuille with Perthshire strawberries and grahams organic cream. They really did look and taste perfect! My partner is a chocolate fiend, you cant leave anything in the house and expect it still to be there the next day! He was head over heels in love with the Belgian chocolate and sea salted caramel tart. I always order the fruity puddings but I have to agree that this little treat was something special. If they were available to order I'd be there waiting to collect! The chocolate ganache was rich and creamy, the caramel just salty enough to balance the crunchy pastry tart case - Wow!",

The service is top notch the stands contain a wide range of savory delights and sweet desserts. The amuse was a sweet corn soup with smoked paprika which everyone loved. There are numerous teas to select from and they are unlimited so you can try several and the server can find one to please you. The savory stand had a wide range of tastes. We all enjoyed the variety. The sweet stand also had many textures and treats. We were full and the remaining treats were packaged in takeaway containers and placed in a lovely souvenir burlap bag. We were celebrating my daughters 21st birthday and they came out with a lit candle on the dessert. The finishing touch was a delicious lemon sorbet. We enjoyed the presentation and encourage you to try the tea for thirty pounds. It was a good value for such a wonderful meal. We had five in our party  could not say enough how we all enjoyed this. They have champagne and cocktails as well. Family friendly for well behaved children.",
