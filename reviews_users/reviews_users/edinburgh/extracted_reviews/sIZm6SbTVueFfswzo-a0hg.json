    "text": "First things first - Mexican food is something that I can love one day, and hate the next, so for my review I put on my unbiased hat and entered Mariachi's.  First thing I noticed is how glad I was that I had booked ahead, as the moderatly sized restaurant was jam packed with customers and full of people looking hungry as they waited for a free table. So tip one - book!  That aside, the traditional mexican music that is barely audable above the hubbub of diners and the neutral decor lends a relaxed atmosphere and the margaritas we had while waiting in the bar area was second to none.  The menu is jam packed with traditional mexican and tex-mex foods, but we had to wait a little while for our orders, and the food was basic and according to my dining partner, the fajitas were bland.  That said, Mariachi's is smack bang in the middle of the city, and is always going to be busy with its trade from tourists - so the atmosphere is great, even if the food is a little uninspiring.",

    "text": "being a natural yelper, when i saw this was where the HR christmas night out was booked, i immediately went and read all the reviews.  which in turn caused me to be a bit concerned that the meal would be a flop and my 22 would not be well spent!  however, on the night of i found my meal to be more enjoyable than expected.  the restaurant is quite sizeable, which i didn't expect walking through the door.  they have the ability to set up long tables for larges parties which is quite suited to a night out as many other office parties seemed to agree.  however, there is a strange downstairs bit that must be for private parties but then you have to walk through the party to get to the toilets, so not sure how great that is....  the festive menu was compromised of a number of items from their normal menu which i greatly appreciated as i've had a few too many turkey dinners as of late!  i choose the nachos and the pulled pork tacos accompanied with a shared bottle of white wine.  i felt our starters came out fairly quickly and i really enjoyed the nachos.  the salsa was super tasty and fresh and the portion was just the right size.  at the same time though, it's a bit difficult to mess up nachos, i mean melt cheese over tortilla chips top with salsa and sour cream.  however, the fresh ingredients definitely help to make the dish better.  my main course seemed to be a bit delayed as everyone else was served their meal and i was left sat at the end of the table with a sad face that had no food in front of it.  the waiter noticed and came right over to check what i'd gotten and then assured me it would just be a few minutes.  now a few minutes while everyone else is tucking in feels like forever, but my pulled pork tacos did arrive shortly and i tucked in as well!  now pulled pork is a recent discovery of mine and i have to say the best come from other tex mex establishments in edinburgh.  however, the tacos were tasty and stuffed full of meat and salsa, but could have used more sour cream.  i ended the meal by sharing a few bites of a warm chocolate pudding with ice cream.  it was tasty, but i'm pretty sure it was store bought and not made on premises.  overall, i enjoyed the meal and may be tempted to return.  however, i didn't feel like this place stood up to my favourite tex mex locations which is why it's only 3 stars.  it seems like a good party location as the waiters are friendly and helpful and more than happy to provide shots of strawberry margarita round the table.  but for a more enjoyable tex mex fix i'll be visiting somewhere else.",

They, like the others I've tried, have no idea what refriend beans should look like. They, like others, use not only the wrong kind of bean but seem to just bake them or somesuch.  And this is coming from a woman who hates beans with a passion.    That said, they also mixed beans into the meat for the tacos. WTF? That's just WEIRD. (and caused me a lot of extra work).  I give my tacos 2.5/5 stars.  The nachos get 4.5/5 - they were superb. And my boyfriend's steak fajitas looked great (and my stolen nibbles give them a 3.5/5.    I'm waiting for a Mexican place in the UK that does the traditional North American thing of a bottomless supply of fresh tortilla chips and salsa on the table as part of the meal.  Having to order/pay extra for it is silly.  Since I got the nachos to start I didn't bother, but otherwise I really want to be able to expect it and have it there.  The decor was pretty nice and the waitstaff was friendly and attentive.  Not a perfect Mexican, but getting closer to what I hope for!",

    "text": "I am a mexican from california and my wife wanted to have mexican food for dinner. She wanted the tacos and I wanted the burrito, but for 11 I wasn't sure how big it was or now good it would be. I asked the waiter how big it was and was pretty disappointed in the size but a man in a suit came by and said he has never heard any complaints in the quality of the burrito. WELL LET ME BE THE FIRST!!  For starters, your appetizers were bland. Your chips and dip was over 4 and the \"tortilla\" chips did not taste like corn tortilla chips. At least the guacamole was good. Your salsa was just big chunks of tomatoes. Your Camarones Picante was pre-cooked shrimp and then recooked with some spices laid over some veggies. The pre-cooked shrimp didn't soak in the spices so it tasted plain. What a disappointment.  The burrito came out and it was small but I was hoping it would make up in taste what it lacks in size. WRONG! This 11 burrito tasted like someone went to Tesco and bought a small tortilla and a can of chili con carne, wrapped it up and made it into an over priced burrito. My wife's two tacos; fried corn tortilla taco shells filled with the same chili con carne and sprinkled with cheese. The refried beens tasted bland and the rice was WHITE RICE. You don't serve WHITE RICE at a MEXICAN restaurant!! You serve red, mexican rice!!!  my 42 bill was $67US Dollars of disappointment that I will never get back. I even told people that were looking outside at the menu not to waste their time.",

Watery salsa, shop bought tortilla chips, unnecessarily large splodges of sour cream,  and a limited selection of beers tainted my image of the place and I nearly got lost heading to what seemed like an endless journey to the gents.  Nonetheless, I left suitably sloshed and with a full belly. Diners can expect to pay around 12 for a main course and 5 for a starter, which considering some of the afore mentioned minor niggles isn't that bad, its just not particularly good either.",

However I'm easy to please as long as my meal is warm, fresh, tasty and nicely presented I'm a happy bunny.   My vegetarian main course was none of those. The vegetables actually weren't that bad, but the rice was bland and cheap, the refried beans were almost cold and none of it tasted particularly fresh. I would have expected a main-course mexican meal to arrive complete with fresh salsa, but it did not, so there was no spicy foil for the guacamole and sour cream, which were unceremoniously slopped on top of the wrap. As a result it looked about as appetising as a dog's dinner and didn't taste much better.   Add to that the fact that a vegetarian main course at lunchtime cost a whopping twelve pounds and you'd be forgiven for thinking I was disappointed. The place was pretty empty even though other nearby restaurants had people queuing at the door. Given the sub-par meal and the grubby/tired restaurant decor, I wish I'd joined them and waited a little longer for a better meal. On the plus side the margaritas were good, but that was no compensation.",

    "text": "Arriba Mexico companeros!   Any guesses?... Yes, you are right!  This is a place is a typical Mexican restaurant with one of the nicest, but not too overcrowded, decoration in Edinburgh. I say this, because La Cantina (another Mexican restaurant near the shore) has almost no decoration at all!   Lovely, cosyYou can find paintings in the yelloy-ish walls, as well as robes and of course, typical Mariachi hats!!!Which is what is actually giving the name to the restaurant.But if you find the absolut need of getting one of them, you can do so for just 5!!! (And you will actually be sorted for the next costume party that you might have)   The restaurant is reeeeeally spacious and has another floor underneath where the toilet are located, but they also have a disabled toilet in the main floor so it is accessible for everyone. Great place for children but also a busy place during the weekend so highly recommended to book in advance.   The food is just traditional Mexican food (although you can have some more continental food as well, especially for children), from Fajitas, Burritos, Enchiladasto handmade guacamole and salsas.   Surprisingly you won't only find super hot food but also nicer and milder food. For those of you who are not familiarised with Mexican food and want to try a bit of everything, you can always get a couple of starters and get a great idea of how real Mexican food is like.   Now about the staff, great people, reeeeally helpful waiters and staff in general. I don't want to forget to mention that the chefs are some of the nicest in town and will only be more than pleased to have a little chat to you, but they never give out the recipes so don't even try!   Vamos, let's all have a margarita!",

The Guacamole has just the right consistency, and is truly delicious!  We all ordered different dishes and then shared to enjoy a wide range of tastes and flavors.  All the dishes were quite good; no one was better than the other three.  That said, if there was a stand-out in that meal, it was the Refried Beans - if you order nothing else when you visit Mariachi, get the Refried Beans and you'll be a happy camper :-)  The next time I'm craving authentic Mexican food in Edinburgh, I'll visit Mariachi for sure!",

    "text": "Summary: Great service, great chips & dips, average food otherwise.  The good: The service was fantastic, with having the right balance of checking to be sure things were going well without being intrusive. The chips, salsa, and guacamole are also probably the best we've had in the UK. (Having lived in Texas for many years, many Mexican restaurants in Europe are just disappointing, but their chips & dip were a tasty surprise.)  The bad: The chicken tacos and cheese quesadillas, while not bad, were not as flavorful as desired. The beans were also a little odd - not really British, not really Mexican.   Overall a great place for drinks and a snack, just perhaps not the full meal.",

I ordered the shredded beef burrito and it was so delicious. My husband ordered their fajitas and it was delicious as well. The chips, salsa, and guacamole were exceptional. Stay for the dessert. The churro's were warm and good. Bottom line is if you're craving Mexican food, this is the place to be. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Mariachi is a good sized Mexican restaurant near to a large number of pubs. A great place to stop by to feed after a drink!   We made a reservation for a group of ten visitors to Edinburgh on a Wednesday evening. Staff were friendly and even when we expanded the group by another two people, they looked after us admirably.   The food at this Mexican restaurant was delicious. I had a Chicken Enchilada which was delicious and served with a side order of refried beans and rice.   There is local beer on the drinks menu, alongside traditional Mexican beer, wine and other beverages.   Our bill came to 27 per head for a two course meal with drinks. Good value!",

    "text": "We went for that lunch offer 2 course 10 and 3 course for 12,5. The restaurant was pretty much empty-that's why I guess it was so cheap. None of the staff was actually Mexican-just as a note.  On offer were chicken wings, nachos and button mushroom in chilli salsa for starter. As main you had the choice of burrito and fajitas.  To be honest: the burrito is not Mexican but ok. The filling of sour cream rice beans and salsa was quite ok but it was not authentic. Same for the fajitas.  The tortillas were flour which is fine. The salsa was suspiciously similar to the one you can buy in supermarkets called 'Old El Paso' Mexican dishes to make at home.  The best though was the dessert. I had a non Mexican dessert: vanilla ice cream topped with espresso, patron cafe XO and whipped cream-it was very good. The churros are very good and their chocolate sauce is amazing. I could take daily baths in chocolate and I can tell the chocolate sauce was very good.  Overall it is alright to go there but it's not authentic enough for a Mexican to be satisfied I would recon.",

The waiter was absolutely amazing- professional, helpful and humble. We had Nachos, fajitas, mussels, and enchilada, and none of us had a single bad thing do say. The salsa sauce was tasty, the nachos and cheese well cooked, the mussels were served with a great tomato sauce, the fajitas sizzling hot and wonderful, and the enchilada cheesy and creamy. The interior is greatly inspired by Mexico, and it was overflowing with people in the evening when we walked by. I understand why- the drink menu looked to die for! Toilets are clean and fresh. I have nothing to complain about. Will return as soon as I can!",

I got enchiladas which were fabulous- a perfectly crafted sauce on too, shredded pork inside, and guacamole made from a real avocado! They had a great margarita selection as well. I got one with patron silver, lime juice and agave nectar, shaken and served straight up in a martini glass with a salted rim. Service was a bit slow at first but did improve. All in all, I'd recommend this place!",

    "text": "This is the closest I've come to stereotypical, completely inauthentic yet delicious Mexican food that you can find in the states. Technically this place would probably garner a solid 3.5 from me, but I'll round up here out of fondness.  My partner in crime and I ventured here on Valentine's day. Surprisingly we managed to find seats quickly, although it was luck of the draw for couples appearing later in the door--they ended up sending quite a few people on their way, so we enjoyed our good fortune! The interior of this place is larger than it would appear from the outside, and comfortably decorated with big hats and maroon walls. Not bad--it did remind me a bit of Mexi restaurants back home there.  However, where you would immediately be greeted by friendly staff bearing gifts of (free) bowls of chips and salsa back home, here you had to order nachos to get the same experience. Le sigh. It's okay though--the nachos were quite delicious, topped with sour cream, peppers, cheese, and the like. We promptly tore into those, which made eating our decently sized main course all the harder. At the same time we'd ordered two \"Perfect Couple\" special cocktails, designed to be a His and Hers sort of thing, that weren't bad! Couldn't tell ya what they were, but I appreciate the diligence for the holiday.  The main courses--for me, vegetable fajitas, for her, a fajita salad--were pretty dern good if a bit perplexing for me. My vegetable mix contained things like baby corn and sweet potato. While delicious, and I'm not complaining, I've never before seen that sort of thing in a fajita mix. I will however issue a hearty complaint at the lack of refried beans and rice that didn't magically appear with my meal. Perhaps I should have studied the menu more, or perhaps I just need to lower my expectations for \"the real deal.\" Seriously though... no refried beans?! What world am I living in here?! Excellent healthcare and public transport totally doesn't make up for this offense!  Anyway, if you're looking for a decent meal of Mexican fare in a pinch, I'd give Mariachi's a go! Just don't be alarmed if you're American when they don't  swamp you with free chips and beans.",

    "text": "I had my doubts about this place - in the middle of tourist central, slightly garishly painted frontage, and blasting salsa music out into Victoria St. Hmm, tacky much?!   But I tried it out with a mate who is a keen bean when it comes to Mexican - and was actually nicely surprised by the food. Portions are pretty big, as we discovered when our starters could've been a whole meal on their own. I went for the chilli mushrooms in their special mariachi 'HOT!' sauce, which were indeed as spicy as the name suggested. Chicken fajitas for main were fairly standard but tasty (and I always enjoy their DIY fun).  Highlight was the drinks menu - tempted as I was by a jug of sangria and a straw, we enjoyed sipping some Modelo and Pacifico goodness mmm. The atmosphere inside is also quite fun - salsa tunes, red walls and all.  Lowlight of the experience was how slow the service was - friendly yes but it was nigh impossible to catch anyone's eye and we had an unreasonably long wait in between courses (though we did need a break after the starters), and an even longer one for the bill.  Probably a useful stop if you're in a large group and not in a rush - it's much bigger inside than it looks and certainly more so than other places on Victoria St. Bonus tip: leave for the toilets in good time - they're a bit of a trek down a warren of corridors downstairs!",

It would be almost like cheating on them if I did that.  But, if you're reading this Mariachi, you're really not that great. When I go to a latino restaurant I expect a great lively atmosphere, cheesy latino music, and amazing home-made food. Unfortunately, the only one of these criteria that Mariachi met was the cheesy music. And 1 out of 3 definitely is bad.  The food was mediocre at best. Having lived in South America for a year you could say that I'm being a bit harsh on them, as nothing back home ever tastes as good as the real thing. But Tex Mex 2 on Thistle Street absoutey blows that theory out of the water, as well as offering much better value for money.  If they insist on charging as much as they do here, they should up their game. Otherwise, they should lower their prices. But until they do, I don't see this place being the massive success that it should be given its location. I'm not surprised the Potterrow branch of Mariachi closed down!",
