    "text": "Salt 'n' Pepper is an amazing place to visit for a healthy and delicious lunch any day of the week.  The shop has a freidnly, relaxing feel to it and you can either sit in or take you food away to enjoy it.   As it's located on George IV Bridge it's ideal for grabbing something quick and easy on the go.  They have a huge range of sandwich fillings, all of which are fresh and many are locally sourced.  There's smoked meats, cheeses, fresh salad and an extensive selection of sauce to choose from.  I usually go for a turkey wrap with cheese, salad and mayonnaise which costs about 2.90, tastes amazing and is the perfect size for a filling lunch.",

    "text": "Lunch places, and the places you jump in for a sandwhich to eat on the train, can be incredibly hit or miss. Well, this place couldn't be more centre in the bulleye.  I popped in today for something to fill that hole between lunch and dinner (it is usually quite a big hole) and I was not disapointed. Decided to choose the falafel wrap - something my carnizerous side gave into last summer - and boy did it satisfy. The falafel was delishious and the cucumber and chili sauce was the perfect addition.   The woman that works there and I imagine owns the place too was very nice and attentive. Thumbs up all round and the price added to that! 3.25 for a crackin lunch!",

As my mum used to tell me, never judge a book by its over - never has a Truer word been spoken!  The staff are lovely here, really nice and happy. It makes a difference when they're happy, doesn't it?!   As for the food - yum. Ok, it's not the most amazing food I've ever eaten, but it's certainly up there. It's a lot  better than your bog-standard sandwich place, it must be said.",

    "text": "Along with the surge of satisfaction that comes with a solid, healthy bowel movement, the feeling of being pleasantly surprised has to be one of life's greatest joys. Salt 'n' Pepper is a sandwich bar that provides such an experience.  It looks bog standard from the outside, but the wraps here are far removed from the tasteless pre-packed chicken ceasar dullness you'll find in the big chains. Huge, loaded with filling and given a couple of minutes on the grill, they are from the very top drawer.  I went for a chicken tikka option with a bit of chilli sauce. I quite literally could not believe how bloody good it tasted. It was almost too good, and I actually felt quite a pang of sadness when it was finished. It really was utterly tremendous, and I'll be back next week.",

They do a subtly spicy chicken tikka wrap that left me tempted to order an other, alongside a number of other tasty fillings.  Prices are average and service was rapid, a fair choice if your milling around George IV bridge.",

    "text": "Yet another sandwich bar in Edinburgh, but they are so hit and miss that you just have to try them all to scope out the extraordinary ones!  Wraps, bread sandwiches, baguettes and paninis can be bought from this well stocked wee deli, and they have plenty of fillings to choose from. Traditional cheese and pickle to falafel to chicken tikka, you will find something you fancy, and, unlike loads of other sandwich stores, this place seemed to have everything in the fridge that it advertised on the board.  At around 3 for a wrap packed with a filling of your choice and wads of salad isn't bad going, and you'll be hard pushed to find anything better than this in the area.",
