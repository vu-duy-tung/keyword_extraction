    "text": "New whisky bar in the west end. 400 whiskies to choose from and a few gins & beers. Lots of Scottish food on the menu from Cullen skink to balmoral chicken and cranachan.  Big bar table, few seats at the bar then low tables and little private booths/cubbies for drinking & eating. A curtain pulls across if you want respite from prying eyes!  Quite noisy and the space was nowhere near full.   Not a bad place to stop in for a drink but would definitely want to be in a booth for more than just one.  Well worth checking out!",

Not only do they have a tremendous selection of whisky including many rare bottles, but we experienced two different people working there who had complete knowledge of all of them. Both times we described what we wanted and they delivered perfect examples. They were also both very friendly and willing to share their time and expertise. The atmosphere is very relaxing and beautiful in a cave-like basement conducive to a memorable experience. Highly recommended!",

As a tourist, I eat at random times but I like to avoid tourist traps. I popped in here in the middle of the day after the castle, and I was still able to get good food. The fish and chips was the best, certainly better then anything I've ever had in the states.  I also liked my cocktail and the service was gracious.",

    "text": "Oooooh, this was very nearly a five-stars for me. Usquabae is an absolutely lovely place and, if you're looking for a nice meal or a good drink, you could do far, far worse.  As far as I can tell, this place is fairly new. It used to be part of Ryan's bar, but they've cleaved-off one part of it and turned it into a thoroughly Scottish (but not at all touristy) bar and restaurant affair.  The upstairs area is a bar with a strong emphasis on the whisky. The decor is sort of contemporary but has an old-fashioned pub feel with low lighting, stools and leather-covered sofas and lots of wood and brass. The atmosphere is actually pretty good and definitely a good shout for a libation. They also do food upstairs but I'm yet to try it!  Downstairs, though, is where the action happens. Beneath street level is a really cool cellar-bar/restaurant. It's very dimly lit, furnished in lots of dark wood and leather and displays their impressive and comprehensive collection of the old fire-water.   I'd strongly recommend calling ahead and reserving an alcove! These tables tucked away in individual recesses give an intimate and utterly unique feel to your face-stuffing experience. I'm not sure what the capacity of each alcove is, but they're quite large and could probably fit at least eight.  The menu is reasonably well thought out and contains some great traditional Scottish dishes amongst the more conventional modern offerings. My one criticism, though, is that they have only two veggie dishes, one of which is an extremely boring and predicable risotto! There's a good chance that you're not a veggie, though, so you'll find plenty of variety to suit your tastes!  Another thing to give a shot is the whisky tasting. The website says you must book in advance, but during the weekday afternoons they are very quiet and could probably handle a walk-in. Their entry-level tasting is only 16, which includes four excellent drams from around Scotland and a half-hour guide through their tasting. That is excellent value!  On the whole, I'm forced to give Usquabae a reluctant four stars only because they have a pretty disappointing selection for non-veggies and are a shade on the expensive side. But if you're looking for a nice place to take some visitors for a meal in an intimate and distinctly Scottish setting, this is perfect.",

The second time I brought a group of friends for a nice meal while they visited and it was fantastic!  The starter of a bread and cheese board wasn't much to write home about but the main courses and the drinks were on point. Chicken stuffed with haggis, game pie, fish and chips and pasta - all good food and good sized portions. The service was amazing as well, they were helpful with the drinks and the food but also were attentive.  We made a mistake thinking vegetables came with a dish and so asked if the vegetables were coming. The waiter went to the kitchen and brought back a portion of veg to which we apologised for our mistake and he said not to worry! Awesome service.  Also a fantastic atmosphere for a first date - busy enough to not make it awkward but private spaces enough for a nice chat!",

Steak and ale pie came out stone cold, and the lamb chops bordered on inedible as they were undercooked. No follow up was made once a replacement meal was delivered, so the waitress had no idea if the meals were ok, or if we needed more water.  This restaurant lacks management, in both front of house, and kitchen staff. Best to avoid.   They comped my replacement meal, but at the lesser value of the two meals (I ordered something different). Wasn't worth my time to complain, and the indifference added further to the bad experience.",

They were doing a group whiskey tasting in the bar but still seating dinner guests in the restaurant.   We got a great \"booth/cave\" table.  The menu was great.  Both local meats and seafood as well as starters and local desserts.  My wife had lobster and scallops.  I had lamb.  Friendly, knowledgeable staff.  We chose dessert and told the waiter the typical whiskeys we like and asked him to choose matching whiskeys for the dessert.  Everything was great and we left stuffed.  2 mains, a beer and a cider, a terrine appetizer, dessert, 2 whiskeys for 80 pounds.  We topped it up to 100 with tip since the service was so personable.  We booked reservations for later in the week when we return to Edinburgh.",

My first surprise was that the name roughly translated means \"whisky\".  All I can say is it was on overall terrific surprise!   My wife and I had a reasonably long day of tourism and while we enjoyed our entire day we were thrilled with how it ended. I'd made a reservation and  had asked for an intimate table. When we arrived they placed us in a 2-person nook.  It looked like they also had a 4-person and maybe 6-person nook...I don't recall :)  But ultimately these are tables which are a couple of steps down off the main dining area which are surrounded by glass encased, shelved walls which encase various whiskies. And each nook has curtains outside the steps which can be drawn for privacy.    Naturally the whisky menu was extensive and prices were reasonable, the service was very good and the food was also quite good.  They also allowed us to take our time and enjoy our evening.  In all seriousness, we could not have been more pleased with Usquabae!",

My wife and I arrived without a reservation and were given the choice ti sit in a room that would soon be occupied by a large party or the bar.  We chose the bar and started with a single malt.  The bar staff is extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  The food was superb.  I had the stuffed chicken which was easily the best chicken I've ever eaten.  I rarely order chicken when dining out but was tempted by this choice and was very impressed.  The food was fresh, hot and cooked to perfection.",

I really identify with this place. Interesting layout, we're currently sitting in our own alcove. I started with pea and ham soup, one of the best I've ever had. Of course me and my wife had the haggis. Very generous portions. My eldest daughter's boyfriend had the haddock and says it was lovely. My youngest had a medium rare rump steak which was very tender. The choice of whisky is incredible, you'll be hard pushed to decide. Highly recommended, book in advance if a weekend.",

    "text": "Minor disclaimer:  This review applies to the downstairs bar section rather than the restaurant itself.  Usquabae is a bit of a hidden gem in Edinburgh.  There is no shortage of whisky bars in Edinburgh, but this one has an amazing collection of malts and impeccable service.  Michael helped us navigate amongst many options that evening.  Now this is a person who knows how to make cocktails, and then some.  Case in point, we opened with a gin martini which sounds relatively simple, right?  Well, his martini was one of the best ones we have ever tried.  He explained the process, the ratios of gin to vermouth to ice, and so forth;  everything precise and logical yet tailored to our palate.  Anyways, onto the scotch.  Michael sat with us for a few minutes and asked us for both a flavor profile and a price point.  It was really a conversation rather than some kind of questionnaire from which he could grab a few bottles that might kind-of-but-not-quite meet the criteria.  We tried a few scotch flights.  Every single selection was great:  these included some of the well-known makes along with distillers few have heard of, likely because production is small or does not make it out of Scotland.  Just as when we ordered, Michael also sat down with us roughly midway the scotch flights to make sure we liked the selection as well as provide some curious insights/history/trivia on the bottles we were trying.  He also helped answer some specific/obscure questions about scotch (we didn't ask these to be snobbish or difficult or the such, but rather because we had in front of us someone who definitely knew this stuff well).  As for the atmosphere - the basement bar has a few private two to four person small coves with comfortable chairs surrounded by shelves upon shelves of whisky bottles.  It's perfect for a quiet and intimate evening;  relaxed and not pretentious.  Bottomline, make sure to visit Usquabae.  And don't be afraid to splurge a bit on their malt collection - you probably won't find many other places with that selection and knowledgeable staff.",

The prices here are reasonable, the service is good, but unfortunately the food is mediocre at best.  My pie and mash main dish didn't come with shortcrust.  As if that wasn't bad enough by itself, there was no grave and the meat was WAY too salty.  All of my friends at the same complaint about their food being much too salty :-(  One of my friends actually took only a single mouthful of his meal, and pushed the whole plate aside saying it was too salty to eat another bite.",

    "text": "Usquabae! A wee hidden gem I've only recently discovered in Edinburgh. I'm pleased that I have--as a recent Scotch convert, Usquabae's West End location and surprisingly expansive Scotch menu had me at \"whisky tastings.\" Good service and lovely meals top this one up to a place you can stop for either a nice dinner, atmospheric drinks and chat, or both!  Usquabae appears to be a newer addition to Edinburgh judging by its clean and modern interior, which is refreshing--old man pubs are great, but it's nice to see something new crop up in the city. It sits in the downstairs portion of Ryan's bar, which makes it easy enough to find, and because of its underground location it has the whole dimly-lit, atmospheric vibe going. It has normal tables and even a few \"bunkers\"--little booth seating areas where you can have a meal, which is nice if you're looking for some privacy.  For me, Usquabae ticked all the boxes for a fantastic evening. As my folks were visiting, and that lead to us deciding to check out Usquabae because they do whisky tastings. For a very reasonable price of around 17 pounds, you can sample the \"Taste of Scotland\" range of Scotch which allows you to try a Lowland, a Highland, a Spey, and an Islay whisky. All this while being guided through your drams by a knowledgeable whisky aficionado makes for a great night. My dad ranked it one of his favorite things done while over. Sure, it's no distillery experience, but when the nearest distillery (Glenkinchie) is 16 miles away and not readily accessible except by car, you make do. And Usquabae provided!  So chuffed with our whisky sampling experience were we that we decided to reserve the same bunker we'd sat in for dinner later. Upon our return, we were served promptly by a chipper young gal who was absolutely lovely. Our service was on point, even despite the fact that there was a party of around 60 youngsters keeping her on her toes most of the evening. As someone who used to be a waitress myself, I clap bravo to her for being giving such excellently friendly service on top of dealing with all that.  So let's talk about the foodstuffs. The food arrived quickly with steak mains for the parentals, and the two veggie options available for the hubs and I. All the food was excellently cooked and delicious, even, surprisingly, my husband's veggie haggis, neeps, and tatties. I don't normally care for veggie haggis, but Usquabae has some sort of magic worked there--it was surprisingly good! Not only that, but my folks' side of chips were perfect. I mean it. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, ugh. So good.  My own risotto was just fine, but there lies my only real beef with Usquabae, but it's quite mild beef if anything. As a veg-head (*queue audience groaning*), risotto is just not my favorite. I mean, come on, it's rice. You can get pretty creative with rice sometimes, but it's still rice. The menu pinned at the door of Usq does mention a veggie pasta alternative, but it isn't listed on the main menu, which gives veggies all of two options for mains, which hubs and I have now exhausted in one fell swoop. That said, the prices were reasonable enough and the food was good, especially according to the folks. I think if there was just one other option for veggies to eat and said veggie portions (and the chip sides so I could stuff my gob!) just a smite bigger, I'd upgrade my review to a solid 5 stars, no questions asked.  That said, I could see Usquabae being my new go-to restaurant to take visiting friends and family for a nice Scottish meal. I could definitely see myself going there for a nice, quiet dram or two if the desire so struck. Keep up the good work, Usquabae--you're a lovely joint!",
