And I heard the avocado toast and french toast were as well. We felt so welcomed and ccomfortable. A truly lovely experience!",

Let's start with the things they're doing right. First of all, I love the interior.  They've chosen the most beautiful, light airy unit and have been respectful to the original features (especially the gorgeous, large windows). The branding is cohesive and extremely endearing, with little bees on most things from the menus to the counter.  They are also part of a charity which helps the preservation of bees in the UK, which I loved!  I'm also pleased to see them using Artisan Roast beans for their coffees and lots of locally sourced produce for their food.   So what's the problem I hear you cry? Well it was one simple (yet usually delicious) word: PANCAKES! I ordered them and they were completely raw in the middle. Again, I'm hearing you say \"3 stars for raw pancakes is a little harsh, isn't It?!\"  So I spoke to the server about my raw pancakes, to which they said sorry and took them away to make me a new batch.  Now, the pancakes that were returned to me were burnt with a slightly, less raw middle. They were genuinely worse than the first ones. Not one server came to ask me about the second lot , and the owners and managers never came over (even though I saw that they were informed in the first instance). When my plate was taken, the waiter asked if they were any better because I had left all but one bite of the burnt pancakes. I explained they were even worse and this guy is the reason that honeycomb aren't getting 2 stars! He apologised and agreed with how bad they looked. He also took the pancakes off the bill which I really appreciated.   So all in all, go here for coffees and to sample their cakes but \"bee\" careful not to order the pancakes!",
