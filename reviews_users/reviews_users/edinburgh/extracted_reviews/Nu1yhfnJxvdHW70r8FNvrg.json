No. Are you going to have some delicious tapas and lovely service that makes the price worth it? Yes.  Came by on our first night in Edinburgh with my boyfriend because of some decent yelp reviews and we weren't disappointed.  The host/server (manager? owner?) took the time to explain ALL of the dishes to us, including all of the specials. [sidenote, being from CA, and hearing Catalonian Spanish with a Scottish accent was such a trip.] He presented and explained all of the dishes table side like you expect in a fine dining restaurant, and brought some olives and bread on the house. We had the four specials, papas bravatos (I think) were my boyfriend's favorite, and the Sancho and Calamari were menu staples that were lovely. Everything we had was cooked perfectly to us, and all of the meats so tender. We washed it all down with a liter of sangria, which had cinnamon as a new twist for us.  Great service, great food, no regrets!!!",

    "text": "El Quijote is a small restaurant that specializes in tapas; it also serves larger dishes.  When we visited here, we found this a bit confusing, as it was difficult to tell from the menu whether a particular selection would be sized like tapas, or a more traditional entree-sized portion.  We ordered what we hoped was a good cross-section of tapas, thinking that if we hadn't ordered enough food we could simply order additional dishes.  After a somewhat longer than comfortable wait, our food started arriving one or two dishes at a time.  That's the way we were expecting it, so we started eating.  Eventually everything we had ordered was served, and we realized that all the portion sizes were small AND expensive for their size (3.50 - 5.00 each) :-(  Did I say small, make that TINY, and ridiculously overpriced.  Even the patatas bravas cost almost 5 for a miniscule bowl...  Having realized that ordering enough additional food to make a reasonable dinner would cost three times what a meal like this should cost, we left hungry, with our wallets and bellies decidedly not full :-(",

    "text": "Came here for a yelp girly lunch following Jenny's weekly newsletter on the best Spanish food in Edinburgh. My taste buds were a tingling. And tingled they were!!   The tabla quijote platter of meat and cheese allowed us to taste every variety on offer. Some were nicer than others (I'm not a fan of blue cheese!) but it was a great sharing plate for anyone who loves cured meat and chorizo. I also ordered a tapas sized of small peppers with white asparagus and topped with an Andalusian sauce. Phallic looking as they were (haha!) I rather liked them. The dish was chilled, asparagus was soft (not crunchy how I normally like asparagus) but tasty nevertheless. The sauce was nice too and I'd order them again.   For my main I ordered the Pork Cheeks stew which was recommended by jenny. I went for the medium side but boy it was big! watch out on the sizes if you're having starter tapas too! The stew was basically a big bowl of soup like stew. Not what I was expecting but extremely tasty. I've never had pork cheeks before but the meat was slow cooked and fell away from the fork. Yum! The only thing was the lack of \"chunky homemade chips\" as described in the menu. There were bits of potato in the stew but chips? Nope.   Would I go back? Definitely. The food was authentic and tasty and its really near my work so v handy! It's small but cute with terracotta pots and plants dotted around inside. Quite quaint. If it wasn't for the garlic in the food it would be an ideal date venue! :)",

    "text": "I think it's fair to say that Spanish cuisine hasn't caught on in the UK in the way that, say, French or Italian has. We're all au fait with authentic coq au vin and insist on our pasta being al dente, but, despite tv chefs throwing chorizo into every second dish, how many of us really know what Spanish food is all about? Tapas and sangria might be holiday staples but when looking for somewhere for dinner Spanish doesn't seem to be the first thing that springs to mind.   El Quijote has changed all that, and in doing so has leaped right to the top of my list of favourite places.  It's small and cosy, with a sort of rustic decor that doesn't overdo it but still manages to feel welcoming and snug. I'm glad we booked ahead as it was full and they were turning people away. The staff are friendly but not overbearing, and the menu is just extensive enough to require some tough decisions but not to leave you languishing in the slough of menu despond.   And the food, of course. Man. That was some of the best grilled meat I've had in ages. We started with some simple tapas: the obligatory chorizo and manchego, and some piquant grilled peppers, to go with the complimentary bread and olive oil. Then onto the main courses. My grilled Iberian pork was incredible (see photo). Tender and pink on the inside, with that nice grilled outside, little bits of crisp and crunch, just heavenly. And the simple accompaniment of potatoes and salad was all that was needed.   I didn't particularly like the wine I chose, so I made up for it by finishing the meal with some unctuously rich sherry from their short sherry menu. Much better than having pudding. The next day I was dreaming of that grilled pork and we'll be back soon to try the rest of the menu.",

    "text": "Wow. Either I've eaten at the wrong place or none of these reviewers have actually been to Spain. I don't mind paying through the nose for tapas. I've been to Tickets and Bodega 1900 in Barcelona which are as about as expensive as you can get in Spain.  What is damning is that they don't have any prices on their website?? The food here was as expensive as the best stuff I've had in Spain but with the poor quality of something you would find in the most touristy place on Las Ramblas. If I can order a leg of the highest grade jamon iberico de bellota for the price you pay in Spain plus 20 EUR shipping I don't understand why it has to be so expensive here.   Most of our best produce goes to Spain as they are willing to pay a higher price, especially for our seafood. Walking around the market there all the langoustines and shellfish come from our West coast. I packed the wee buggers one summer on the Isle of Skye and every day refrigerated Spanish lorries would pick them up live to drive back to Spain. The Spanish are very very particular about quality of ingredients and this place did not follow the tradition.   An order of small calamari was something like 7 and the earthenware bowl it came in had a crack in it. Not a chip, but a crack where you can get dirt and it won't wash out. That would fail a health and safety inspection double quick time.  The mains are pushing high teens. I was dubious after ordering a starter and seeing the prices upfront so didn't go crazy and was glad because of it. I also had croquettes which were decent but the side salad was wilted and horrid and the type you get from 3663 or brakes.. Why even put a side salad with croquettes? Oh maybe because you are charging more than 6 for them.. They should be on a small plate adorned with only a small piece of paper underneath to catch any oil. It's deep fried bechamel sauce, about the cheapest food you can possibly make!  Wine choices as well were pretty dear. You could fill up a van with stuff to supply a Spanish restaurant for a good while and drive it back making a tidy profit which is what I imagine they do.   Do not recommend.",

Like others have said, this place is authentic. No oily, weird UK tapas here. The selection is classic with a few surprises here and there. They also have a daily specials board. Interior is small and homey and the service is very good, very friendly. Good selection of wines at a good price.   We had a mix of several things. The Tabla Iberica plate is a mix of cured meats. You could order ten of those and be satisfied in Spanish meat heaven. It is delicious. Also tried the fried cod, calamares and pork cheek stew. Yum, yum, yum. Squid is fresh and has a delicious light batter. Love that it isnt some frozen, prebattered stuff. Cod was equally tender and juicy and in a lovely light batter. Pork cheek stew was in a delicious broth and the meat was fall-apart tender. You could eat a huge pot of that.   Really happy we came across this place. El Quijote has restored my faith in Spanish tapas in the UK. Skip all the chain tapas places and just go here.",

They made sure that our dinner party of three were as comfy as can be and this is really important cause we were dining with a toddler.   The waitress was very friendly with my wee one and even took her back to the kitchen to say hello to the chef and show her stuff! It made me feel like I was back home in Spain.   Now to get to the food. It was great. By far the best Spanish food I have had in Scotland. The Gordiales were authentic Sevillan olives. The salmorejo (a type of gazpacho) had punch and was very tasty. The chips were perfectly fried and not greasy. The chicken was scrumptious and juicy. The cook even created a special plate of food for my wee one, tortilla francesa con tomate! Basically an egg omelet with tomato wedges.  You gotta love this kind of personalized service. Its a special place that makes such an effort with your childs needs and also serves quality tasty food. I will most definitely be going back.",

Firstly the waitresses were extremely accommodating, we were late, and when i called the resturant to advise of this it was no problem! The restuarant is very small and can likethe other reviews suggest be quite cramped. We ordered the platter, which comprised of a selection of Salami & Cheeses, you could certainly taste the quality of the food! The Rioja was lovely and the ambience was very romantic.  Only slight downside was their was only 2 waitresses serving and service suffered slightly ( but only a tiny bit)  If you are thinking of going here, then do!! Its worth every penny &  remember to book in advance!",

Authentic spanish food; the famous iberian ham where the pigs eat only the acorns, delcious manchego cheese, and the olives!  To be honest I'm not even sure where to start, perhaps the ham, jamon.  Cut in the traditional thin slices it melts in your mouth with a delicous savory salty essence of Spain.    There was also an amazing venison dish, with black salt on top!   The meat was a bit on the tough side, but the flavours and the spices truly brought me back to my times to Spain.  Atmosphere is rather cute of them trying to transport you to the Frontera, but its the food that succeeds in this desire.  In my top 5 restaurants of Edinburgh!",

Prior to eating in EL Quijote, i wasnt overly impressed by any of Spanish the restaurants in Edinburgh. On the outside, it is very unassuming without the cliched decoration featured in the likes of La Tasca - here is traditional ceramic crockery, surrounded in a Truely authentic Spanish setting.  When my partner and i entered were instantly made to feel very comfortable and given the best seat at the window. I visited Barcelona in the recent months before and eating here took me back to the delightful experience of eating rustic, fresh Spanish food - at not too much of a cost ! I had the Spanish Fishcakes - and i can honestly say that they were the nicest fishcakes i have ever tasted, oh and the manchego is lovely. Fairly priced. i would recommend this wee delight to anyone looking for a nice Spanish meal in Edinburgh. I will definetely be back.",
