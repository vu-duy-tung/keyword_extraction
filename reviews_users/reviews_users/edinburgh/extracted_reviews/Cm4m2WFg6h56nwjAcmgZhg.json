    "text": "A very happy accidental find. My family and I were trying to find a restaurant for dinner and this was our third attempt -- without a reservation.  (We are tourists...who makes reservations in a country they don't know?!)  Between the intermittent rain showers and the Fringe Festival going on, the crowds were everywhere.  This place was off the Royal Mile so it seemed approachable enough.  Anyway, we walked in - cold, tired, and hungry.  This place accommodated my family of four without a reservation. Yeah!! At first glance - tres chic and bistro like setting.  Two dining rooms - one smaller for intimate groups of 2 or 4.  Then the larger adjoining room for everyone else.  It was quite lively in that room vs the more intimate room where we were seated.  The food was excellent but the service was very lax.  It took about 20 minutes before anyone came to our table to take our order - even though in 2 minutes time after being seated, we were served flat water.  Being annoyed now, as we watched a waitress going back and forth; no one came over to take our order. Soon, other tables seated after us all ordered (to be fair, they waited as well just not as long) and yet we were last. Grr. Some confusion as it seems - the one person that brought us the menus along with the water (with lemon, a plus) was supposed to take our order.  Not knowing he didn't, the waitress we saw many times, assumed we did.   I took my time oogling the menu over and over - finalized my choices to the below, all were scrumptious.  (Hence the 4 stars for a superb meal - almost deducted a star for the lack of service in the beginning but they made up for it somewhat after).  Believe me, the menu was so appetizing, it was hard to choose.  Appetizers: seared scallops with black pudding, bacon and pureed peas... meaty and balanced (menu said crispy pancetta - it was bacon strips = same difference). The scallops were meaty, quite large in size and looked different from what I usually get in the US.  These still had the coral still connected (see photo).  So succulent.  The pork rillets over salad (with toast it said but no toast came with).  The plating looked like a pork belly stir fry over lettuce - not quite pretty but definitely savory.  A tad too salty for me but hubby liked it a lot.  The meat was tender and flavorful.  Every piece bite size and juicy.  If this were an Asian establishment, I would think it would be great if served in lettuce cups.    Onto our entrees:   The duck with Drambuie and Raspberries - I saw quite a few recommendations for this dish and it was a reoccurring photo on Yelp, so we had to try.  The duck was roasted, medium well - still pinkish color on some pieces.  Some pieces were a tad tough to chew, especially for my son, but the flavors were on point.  Beautifully plated and tasted just as good overall.  I had the lamb loin and haggis - figured I should try the National Signature meat while in Edinburgh, Scotland.  For those that don't know, Haggis is a mix of minced ingredients - sheep's heart, liver and lungs, combined with onions, suet, and spices.  The lamb and haggis was wrapped in a puff pastry and served with a cracked pepper sauce.  If only I had more puff pastry or bread, I would've sopped up all that sauce.  The lamb combined with the haggis was a superb combination.  The lamb was not gamy at all; juicy and tender all around.  I loved it.  Hubby ordered the whole boneless sea bass.  Presented \"en papillote\" (cooked and served in a paper wrapper), presentation was so inviting.  The hot ginger gave it a nice tingly finish.  And the accompanying prawns were quite sizeable.  The dish resembled a Thai Curry to me - both in color and smell.  It was just the dish to hit the spot on a cold, damp evening.  Given the slow service and lack of...we skipped on dessert.  If only this place could pick up the pace, then it'd be a 5 star experience.  But many thanks to the manager that agreed to seat us.  We still left a tip for the waitress given she looked overwhelmed.  And while not obligatory to even having to leave a tip (UK is different than USA), we figured it was in good taste.",

The staff were very helpful, when we originally booked we didn't know how many there would be, we started off at 5 and ended up with 18. They let us have a semi private room which was fab for us and the other guests as we were a bit noisy.  They phoned us to confirm a few details and were just great.   I had the duck breast and sweet potato side which were just delicious. Every single person in our party really loved their food.   Actually I can find no fault in their restaurant hence the first 5 star review I have ever given!",

    "text": "As a regular visitor to Thistle St, I had perused the menu at Iris once or twice on the way to the Bon Vivant. After reading JD's blog and seeing the picture of the duck dish, I booked for a friend's visit to Edinburgh.  Our food was excellent. Having already had mini bites and wine late afternoon at the BV, we went for a main and pud. The duck was beautiful - cooked pink, decent sized portion and the raspberry sauce added a lovely sweetness to the duck which didn't over power. You do have to order sides separately, so we went for winter vegetables and sweet potato wedges with chili and coriander mayo. Winter veggies were lovely and cooked to perfection but the sweet potato wedges and mayo was divine! Seriously, we both loved this dish  and I would even go back to have this side on its own as a drinking munchy snack.   Pud's were good - I'm GF so the cakes were off limit but I had a (warm) plum compote which was normally served as part of the crumble with vanilla ice cream. It was decent enough but not wow, though this can be tricky with puds which are GF. My friend loved her key lime pie.  We were around 60ish for two courses each (main and puds+2 sides which you order separate to your main), 2 soft drinks, a bottle of red (lovely). Probably not the cheapest meal but it was very good quality and would be good for a treat or if they do set menu's which other reviews have suggested (just not when we were in).  Staff were friendly and service was good. Atmosphere wise, we probably weren't in the best place - we sat at the side near the door, so you would get a bit of a draught and it was a bit of a tighter space, so if you book in advance, it is probably worth asking for a table in the main part of the restaurant.  So, well worth a visit",

I was in love with the scallops and fried prawns and everything on the menu was so tempting it was hard to chose. We used to go from loads of big ground nights out because of the layout tables could be pushed together easily.  A modern wine list is present and staff are friendly but I grew out of love very fast when it the newness became a bit boring and when we walked in off the street and stood at the foyer/till waiting to be seated, not only were there no customers, there was no staff.. after 10 minutes and trying to find someone who worked there we gave up and went elsewhere and I haven't been back. It seems to have lost all it's appeal and I hope that it'll bring it back because the chef's really were fantastic.",

Situated on Thistle Street, Iris is right in the centre of the New Town area of Edinburgh and it is just around the corner from the main shopping street, Princes Street, and so it is a convenient place to reach.   Iris is really small from the outside, and walking past it I didn't think it was a restaurant at all. I came here a few weeks ago with my parents for lunch and we had a wonderful time. Iris's menu offers a decent choice of authentic British dishes such as steak, lamb and roast duck. I had the scallops for a starter which were really beautifully cooked and served with ham which tasted amazing. I then had salmon with anchovies and tomatoes which was gorgeous - I didn't think I liked anchovies, but they tasted amazing with the salmon - yummy! The portion sizes are really decent and the prices are super reasonable too, with two courses costing about 11, and a three course meal costing 15 - what a bargain!!   Iris is a great place to go for a wonderful tasting meals at amazing prices.",

Overall, we said: \"Iris offers extremely high quality food, in swish surroundings, with excellent, friendly, knowledgeable service. The only other person I've heard extolling its virtues is ardent Yelper Jurgen, who is a great fan of the place.

But the plus side of this is that the competition among them means that the good ones are usually extremely good.  Iris is the newest addition to this collection on Thistle Street. Although their A La Carte is a little too expensive for what it's worth (hence only 4 stars and not 5), their set lunch menu offers great value for money. I'd highly recommend their Mussel starter - it comes with toaste pine nuts, bacon and fresh basil cream. It'll have you racking up the hours in the gym in the days that follow, but it's so worth it!",

A good quality, well priced wine list (including two rose when many places mysteriously only manage one)sets off well the food menu (half a dozen reasonably priced starters, 8 or so main courses leaning strongly towards the top of the 9 - 15 bracket, 3 cheaply priced salads, half a dozen medium priced side-orders and a handful of mid-price desserts (cheese 5.90)).   My duck was melt-in-the-mouth tender and the ginger infused sauce a delight whilst the side order of green beans were cooked to perfection. Desiring more than one type of veg with your main dish could though start making thigs quite pricey so sharing is a good idea. The lemon tart with blackcurrant coulis was a pleasant dessert and the Spanish rose washed it all down well.",

I was happily surprised to see the trendy and elegant decor inside, without it being overly pretentious.   The thing that shocked me (in a good way!) was how delicious and elegant the food was, without having to mortgage the house to pay for the meal. As an American, I am already pissy when having to spend pounds v. dollars, so the fact that I was able to have a delicious meal, with starters, mains, dessert, and 2 glasses of wine for a reasonable price shocked me. Not to say the a-la-carte menu was cheap by any means, but for the tasty food, nice decor and good service I was very happy to pay what they asked!  The garlic fries that we ordered as a side to our black pepper steak was the best garlic fries I've ever tasted in my life. The steak was tender and was like butter in our mouths! The wine list was fantastic and the dessert menu was innovative.  Would definitely recommend this spot and can't wait to try it again!",

    "text": "My 100th review!!! WOOT WOOT. I remember when writing 100 reviews seemed like an impossibility but here I am. Just finishing my 100th and I feel on TOP OF THE WORLD. wwwhoooo hoooo. Ok enough of that on to reviewing this restaurant.  I went to Iris with my parents after it came highly recommended from some Scottish friends of mine. At first when we walked in the restaurant was completely empty and I got a little worried (I mean after all it was 7:30... not an unusual time for most people to be eating dinner...) but needless to say that by the time we left the restaurant was full of people. It was nice though because for the 20 minutes we had the place all to ourselves.  We ordered the lamb loin to start and it was SCRUMPTIOUS... we all inhaled in in like 10 sec. and the roasted tomatoes were done on the vine which I thought made them even better and sweeter.... Would totally order it again though the portion of the lamb was a bit skimpy... but then again that's one of my large critiques for the whole restaurant - that the portions were really small and that there wasn't much meat for cost... which is a no no in my book and thus -1 *.  For dinner I ordered the Monkfish which I would have to say though beautifully cooked had an extremely disappointing sauce. The sauce almost tasted like mulled wine and while I applaud the chef for thinking outside the box... any sauce that tastes like mulled wine just does not fly. Also, the monkfish just sat there on the plate with nothing under it or no vegetable of any kind which I though was extremely embarrassing and that it goes against one of the fundamental rules of plating when it comes to food.  Despite this shortcoming the sweet potato fries that I ordered where absolutely AMAZING and I loved them and in fact I could make a meal out of them. Thus solidifying the 4 star rating.  For desert I had sticky toffee pudding and it was absolutely AMAZING too.   Needless to say I would totally go back. The wine we had was good and our server was nice. The atmosphere was cozy and modern and the street it was on was cute and quite. I would totally go back and if Iris was in St. Andrews I would be going there for my birthday.   --- What great resturant to make my 100th review on!!!---",

The interior reminds me of something you would find in a hotel, with fancy, patterned wallpaper, plush seats and clean lines, giving off a very modern and cosmopolitan feel. The waiter who took us to our seats couldn't have been nicer, and pulled my seat out and everything. Chivalry is not dead, it would seem!  The menu is European, which makes for a nice choice if you and your dining partner can't agree on a cuisine. It does a particularly lovely line in seafood, which suits me down to the ground, yet repulses my partner. Luckily for him, the menu is rich in red meats too, which is ideal for his tastes. Everyone's happy!  I had he scallops with Iberian ham for a starter, which were tender, juicy and most importantly perfectly cooked. I can count the amount of times I have had perfectly cooked scallops on one hand, but I continuously get them just incase they happen to be done right, and when they are, they are the best things ever! These were probably the best I have tasted.  I decided to stick to fish for my main, and had the panfried fish with sweet and sour dressing. I don't usually go for sweet and sour but this was really outstanding. It was fresh, tasty and zingy, it really packed a punch. It came with a salad but I ordered sweet potato fries to go with it, which were so tasty. My boyfriend pinched a few too, and couldn't rave about them enough.  We stuck to the two courses, which came to 11.95 each excluding drinks and sides, so the menu came to around 30 for two courses each, a side and a couple of drinks, which I thought was great value. Next time, I am definitely trying the lamb though...the table next to us had it and the smell nearly had me sitting on the guys knee! Fantastic.",

Our starter was given away to the table behind us (with no apology, though we could clearly hear the servers discussing the mistake), my husband did not get the menu item he ordered, and my dish (lamb rack) was hardly tasty enough to make up for the tiny portion and eternal wait. When we got our bill, the server left us with the credit card machine for so long that we finished the process ourselves and had to leave the machine on the table. I think most of these issues could be solved with more employees.  I'd steer clear of Iris until they get more and/or better staff.",
