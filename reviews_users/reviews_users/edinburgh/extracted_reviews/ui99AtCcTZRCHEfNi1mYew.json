Best of all it feeds you cheap tasty food with no concession to style or trendiness. Lunch is such a bargain though the puds are a bit dull",

This place is great for kids - the staff are excellent with them, and will take then to see the pizzas being made and baked in the wonderful stone oven at the back of the restaurant - and they are quite flexible about your orders so you can quibble until you've requested what you really want. The staff are quite good generally, and the maitre-d' is practically an old family friend these days as he always remembers us and will reminisce about how small I once was. Which all makes me wish the food was spectacular. But it isn't. The last four times I've been here they've burnt the base of my pizza, and the fish is not the best, by any means. It's all a bit uninspiring. However, if fussy, unpredictable children are who you're basing your dinner plans around then it's definitely to be recommended!",

    "text": "Got there for a Monday evening meal (only 2 more tables occupied, the rest was empty) and order a pizza capricciosa and a Moretti bottled beer. It was my third visit in 20 years and unfortunately for its punters and me the overall quality is still very poor. The interior and deco look like a derelict picture of a tacky mid 80's cheap food parlour in Staten Island, NYC. Soft drinks & sodas were half full big plastic bottles kept outside the fridge, only cooled \"on demand\" by adding a couple of ice cubes...zero CO2...satisfaction unguaranteed. Service wise....only includes taking your plate/drink from A to B and vice versa... The food: You cannot aim to make a first class pizza with second class ingredients (apart from the small slice and a half of Parma Ham that topped it). The tomato sauce topping was scarce and tasteless, the mozzarella was \"serie B\", black olives were C class ones, the salami was the one sold pre-sliced & pre packed to be avoided at all costs, no after taste of yeast or basil from the dough & topping sauce (real and desirable stuff that you can get from a truly Neapolitan pizza) ... the egg on top was True though...  The result is a bland, insipid and truly unremarkable pizza. On the pro, the pizza was photogenic.  In any case that stuff is not even acceptable after a binge drinking session at 3AM...but don't worry they are close at that time of the night. The place is strategically located in the Elm Row area of Edinburgh/Top of Leith Walk and makes it's living under the shadow of the Playhouse Theatre and its public...it could be a real knock out...but is obviously not.",

I stuttered in amazement when one of the staff told me, as I was sure he'd made a mistake. But as many other Edinburgh businesses, they've been around for donkey years!  Although the menu has the usual Italian dishes (pasta,meat etc) this place seems to pride itself on their pizza; they've got a traditional log fired pizzeria and at least 30 pizzas on the menu.  I wouldn't say Jolly's is the fanciest of the Italian restaurants in Edinburgh, but it's definitely cosy!",

    "text": "In Scotland for a month, and living in a third floor flat on the corner next to Jolly Ristorante.  Had wondered by several times, but finally decided to swing in for their 5.45 three-course lunch.  While it's True that it's not exactly much of a looker inside OR out, I have to say that it's probably the best bang for my buck I've found in Edinburgh at lunchtime.  I started with a tasty if not spectacular tomato soup (w/bread and butter), then had to pick my jaw up off the floor when the server followed it up with a HUGE portion of carbonara and HALF of what must be a large margherita pizza.  The pizza was fantastic, and the while some might accuse the pasta of being a little too rich, I thought it was quite good.  After somehow managing to shove all that food in my face, I couldn't even think about dessert, so I took the pineapple fritter home.  With a wide selection of both Italian and Scottish starters and entrees, and two dessert choices you're likely to find something you like in this lunch-deal, and equally likely to find yourself unable to muster up enough of an appetite to eat the rest of the day.  Not fancy, but decent grub at a great price and thoroughly filling.",

Some compromises have been made on quality, but that's an inevitability at the price they charge.  Overall, we said: \"Jolly is a bit of a curate's egg. The starters weren't great, but the mains were very good. Overall, it's a really good option if you're looking for a large lunchtime feast, perhaps to be followed by an afternoon of hearty imbibing in one of the local hostelries. The pizzas are definitely their strength, with their full menu offering a wide array of choices, so should definitely be sampled during your visit.\"",

It's not a pretty restaurant in my opinion but the interior was much better and I decided to stay and have a pizza because I had heard that the log fired pizzas were brilliant from here.  I have to be honest, I don't really rate this place at all. The service was quite unfriendly, I felt bad for asking the waiter to bring me something else, which seemed like a chore and the pizza wasn't as good as I expected it to be.  The choice of pizzas are vast and I'm sure that its a matter of personal taste but the food didn't do it for me. It wasn't too expensive and there were other choices on the menu, so maybe I should have went for something else.

Special menu for pre-paid meal. 5 starters and selection of mains. All of us had something different and all of us were disgusted. Pastas totally uneatable. Full of fat and cheap cheese all over the place. Soup with piece of white toast bread (Italian?!?!?!?!). Rose wine was actually water with hint of rose. 3 glasses of rose on table (the same one) all 3 different color Cutlery  every single one different. 1/2 pizza and 1/2 pasta served on one plate. If it can be called plate. It was some kind of plastic round tray and seems to be used for years. Pizza dipped in fat from pasta. Jug of water on the table  dirty.  We've all had a feeling of not being very welcome. You pre paid, only 26 for 4 so eat fast and go away!.  Not very good service as at the time when 2 of us were finishing starters other 2 just got it. Same with mains.  Sorry guys but groupon will not help you. This place is dying. It has not been refurbished for at least 20 years. It's a bit ugly, with no atmosphere and not good food (except pizza). Very, very very disappointed.  Would it be different if I'd go there without groupon??? As I can see on other reviews it's possible. I'm not going to check it, sorry.",

They've had the same menu for years, but what I found annoying was that a lot of dishes didn't have descriptions so if you don't know Italian or are familiar with the names then it means having to ask.   My starter was mozzarella rice balls, priced around 5, which came on a huge plate with different meats, olives, salad etc! I wasn't expecting any of that so it was a pleasant surprise and great value! However there was a lot of olive oil and the actual mozzarella balls didn't seem to have much mozarella which was a little disappointing.   For my main I had a 'Opera' pizza (chicken, bacon and olives) which was lovely, only negative was the bacon was in tiny thick cubes that were very dark!   We decided to have a strawberry cheesecake to share, but would definitely not recommend it!! It was mushy, tiny and covered in cream. If you've ever had a frozen one then it's similar to that but worse! Extremely disappointed by that.   But overall, good value and the staff are very friendly and helpful.",
