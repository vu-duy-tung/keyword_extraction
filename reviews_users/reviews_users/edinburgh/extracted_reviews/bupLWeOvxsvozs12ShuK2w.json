    "text": "I have been getting my coffee and lunch from here for a while and i thought its time to review the place. First of all i want to say there are several option right next to this shop but I must say that the quality of the options here are much better than the competition. Its not the cheapest option but quality outweigh the price difference.  Their black americano is my normal choice and its full flavored, rich and served hot. The sandwiches and salads at lunch are also quite luxurious and i can only recommend that you try it if you are in the area.  Lastly even when the shop looks under siege in the morning and around lunchtime the service is quick and with a smile.   Simply a great place",

Caffeine has changed hands a couple of times but it remains one of the absolute best coffee shops in Edinburgh. By focussing on one thing and doing that one thing extremely well the friendly and efficient staff service a huge bunch of satisfied (and probably addicted) customers. There is a small seating area and newspapers are thoughtfully provided. The coffee is, of course, Illy - the machine itself is a work of art. There are splendidly tasty cakes, buns & biscuits sandwiches and soft drinks but it is the coffee makes it so perfect.",

Picked up a sandwich this time too which was awesome, really fresh interesting, quality fillings and they also had a delicious selection of salads aswell, next on the list is the butternut squash, feta, red onion and lime dressing salad, looks ace. Found out they're associated with Clarks of Bruntsfield so would explain the uptake of more food offerings.   Definately worth a visit.",
