    "text": "Juice Bars are easily my favourite things on this planet, from the whole fruit smoothies to the fruit and veg blended juice drinks, I am in love with it all. This is some of the best I've ever had. And I've tasted a lot.   I was in Hula Juice Bar today and had the Blue Hawaiian smoothie, which contains blueberries, strawberries, banana and apple, and was absolutely beautiful. I didn't try any food but I'll definitely be back to do so as it looks amazing. I have so many reasons to come back; hundreds of juice and smoothie combinations to try!  The venue itself is so accommodating and friendly. The vibrant colours and the eccentric mismatched chairs add a happy atmosphere, which is helped along by the friendly full-of-smiles staff, who seem to know quite a few of the regulars by name.   If you're craving a juice fix, I insist you head down to the Grassmarket and try some outstanding smoothies. You'll thank me later!",

I had come here once before and ordered a cinnamon latte. When I returned for my second visit, they didn't seem to have it on the menu. But when I asked about it, they were more than happy to make me one! Delicious..  They have just undergone renovations, and it looks great! A lot more Hawaiian/hula themed, and just as cosy as before!   The soups of the day are fantastic and I would highly recommend them. I've noticed that the ingredients they use seem very fresh. Definitely my lunch/coffee place of choice when hanging about the grassmarket!",

The manager is a very friendly and dedicated lady and this adds to the quality of the experience. The menu is very rich and it always includes a fairly good selection of cakes.  I personally love thicker drinks, so I definitely appreciated the possibility of adding frozen yogurt for only 50p. It makes the smoothies absolutely outstanding without ruining the taste.

    "text": "Last time, I gave Hula 4 stars - they charged for GF bread so that ticked me off. Didn't stop me from going though and I do visit more regularly than my check-in's suggest - namely because I head in, grab food and then have my hands too full to use the Yelp app (and iphones are fragile little darlings and don't react well to cobbles) as I'm walking up Victoria St.  I love Hula. When I'm tired I head to Hula. When I have crap hair and dodgy skin, I head to Hula. When I've walked into town and need refreshments, I head to Hula. So why is this? I love their smoothies and juices. As I said in my last review - I eat my veggies, but as far as I was concerned, veggies were for eating, not drinking. Now, I drink my veggies courtesy of the Popeye - spinach, apple, lemon and nutmeg. It is divine! It is my cold curer - get in there as soon as the sniffles start and if skin and hair looks ropey then I order a large Popeye and I soon have a ready-brek glow.  Food is great too :-) No charge now for GF bread - hurrah but something happened on my last visit. Something immense that only GF people can understand. Normally chicken soup is off limits. Creamy (not overly so) chicken soup, with chicken bits and is good for the soul, but usually comes packed with wheat flour so is off limits. But at Hula - I HAD CHICKEN SOUP FOR LUNCH AND IT WAS AWESOME! It was gf, had ginger in it - ha! potential cold had to go somewhere else after that - and it was so damn good and reminded me that I miss having chicken soup for my lunch if I'm out and about. I had the soup and sandwich deal (gf bread) which was tons of food with my sandwich packed full of spicy tuna and only 5. Worth more for the virtuous healthy feeling I had leaving Hula.  So, yep Hula is well worth a visit. You know already that it's a great wee colourful haven on a dark, cold winters day with friendly staff, free wifi, awesome drinks and food, so if its been awhile, its time to get reacquainted.",

And now, I find that in that very spot exists the infamous, wonderful smoothie hula haven I've heard so much about! (And they really do go to town on the hula theme!)   Hula is just the right sort of small to feel cosey and not cramped. The staff were super welcoming and it was great to see that we got 10% off our order when we checked in on Yelp. Hooray!  I went for the Betty Ford with strawberry, peach, apple and banana and my smoothie significant other went for a Ginger Jack fruit juice with carrot, ginger, apple and orange. Wow! I will not accept any less than the smoothie scrumminess that is Hula. They tasted like pure fruit and were blended to perfection.   With our yelp discount, it came to about the average cost for two large smoothies at any smoothie bar. But tasted like one of the best smoothies I've had. And I've had a fair few! (Got to get them fruits!) Now to say I'd get the train to Edinburgh just to get my Hula fix would be a crazy lie. (Boy, I wish I could!) But when I'm in town, it's first on my agenda!",

Ginger?) but once I heard those things I was like - SOLD.  We got a wheatgrass \"booster\" too which didn't affect the taste like I thought it would, fortunately.  I think it was about 5 for a large with the booster.  Worth it!  My fiance and I shared it, though I drank most of it because it was so addictively good.  So fruity and yummy, you'd never know how many vegetables you were consuming!  I watched them make it, which was really fun, they have these crazy industrial blenders and just jam whole apples in there.

What a score to find Hula.   The decor is bright and tropical themed (as one would hope with a name like 'Hula' - it will help you forget a damp grey day for sure.  The front room was bustling, but there's a back room, and that was nice and quiet, we managed to have a great meeting over lunch back there.  She managed to have more than just that cup of tea she'd been planning on sipping - the juices on the menu fit into her plan that day, and the green one she picked out was really nice, tasted like 'home juiced' if that's a thing.   I had a spicy tuna wrap (chilli tuna, guacamole, rice, cheddar, mixed salads), it was a solid 'good', I remember feeling like it could've had 'more' - not sure what, cheese for sure, salsa would've lifted it beautifully, I don't remember thinking the rice added much.  The salad falls on the short lists of salads in restaurants I will eat - I remember it being full of bright, vivid colors (I am very picky about salads).    All in all, for price, convenience, quality of food, ability to accommodate me and my friend, it was the perfect spot for lunch that day.  I have since recommended Hula to a coworker who was out for a lunch a few days later.  He reported back that he liked it and would be back.   I work in the neighborhood and based on my own experience, and what I've read here - I'll pop back in sometime to try something else - a friend of mine has raved about the soups.  Might come back here after and add a star...",

It wants to be a healthy cafe, it wants to be a hip eaterie, it's colourful and on Victoria street. There is wifi. It has a lot of potential.  I got soup today. Tasty, but at 4.25 a little on the steep side given that so many other places in town offer more for less. My friend paid around 5 for her smoothie, which though tasty was certainly not worth the high price tag.   I had a look at the cakes before leaving the shop, a few gluten free options but nothing particularly inspiring.",

There is outdoor seating along the front for nicer days. Inside in the main room there is some seating but if you venture in, there is more seating! Very comfy and cozy place.   We didn't stay, I ordered the Popeyes juice cause I love those super-jam-packed, full of vitamins and goodness type of juices. It was very tasty and my toddler approved. We also got a veggie wrap which had some creamy guacamole and loads of fresh crunchy veggies!   All in all  very tasty and one of the only places in Edinburgh to offer fresh juice. And by fresh juice I mean, freshly squeezed or liquified right  in front of you. None of this bottled none sense. Fresh and unapologetic.   Definitely will be coming back! Child friendly and good wholesome fresh food & juice. Really couldn't ask for more.",

It's a small spot, but with a lot of character and they like to highlight local artists on the walls. They have very impressive vegetarian and vegan options for those with dietary restrictions and they make truly wonderful smoothies if you're not in the mood for coffee or tea (seriously, you've got to try their awesome fresh fruit smoothies!).  They have some very unique menu creations which will keep you returning to try new dishes each time and nothing we tried was even remotely disappointing. Every bite was pure culinary genius!  If you're headed to Edinburgh, this is a really great place to get breakfast each morning.",

The drinks are a little sweet for a real juicer like me (a little too much apple), but still healthier than the fake sugar in most other mainstream juice places. And since juicing isn't really a thing there, some sweetness is to be expected.   So I can appreciate that they are trying to spread the juice culture to Edinburgh - they even had a class about why you should juice.   Nice people and good sandwiches/wraps as well. I hung out there and used their wifi while eating and drinking healthy stuff.",

Located in a great spot for tourists checking out key areas in the city, it's in an ideal spot.  It looked warm and bright from the outside so we headed in with ideas of coffee and cake.  They were able to accommodate five of us in a back room that you wouldn't know existed if just looking in from the outside.   Decorated with lots of cute pictures of animals it was a fun place to spend an hour warming up, reliving tales of Hogmanay and cure our weary bodies.  Once we glanced at the menus we all swiftly changed from wanting coffees to wanting to try something from their extensive juice and smoothie menu.  I opted for a delicious and zingy smoothie of Apple, lime, ginger and lemon, with an added energy shot of guarana and ginseng. Just what the doctor ordered!   They had some lovely gluten free cakes on offer, but my smoothie was sufficient for me. Some of my friends got cakes though and really enjoyed them.  The smoothies very tasty and healthy, though a tad expensive at 5 for a large. We were pleased to find we could unlock a 10% off code when checking in on the Yelp app and so we had that knocked off our bill. Every little helps.  This is a really cute, wholesome cafe. A great little find.",

There is free wifi for you to while away the hours as you enjoy the brilliant selection of smoothies (my personal favourite is the Whirling Dervish with an energy shot), coffees courtesy of Artisan Roast and the most amazing selection of cakes.   The ethos in Hula is definitely around making the customer feel important and you always feel the personal touch, even when it is incredibly busy which it usually is for most of the day. The new refurb has made the space a lot more open and the extra large windows give a great view of the passing crowds in the Grassmarket and Victoria Street.  I can't recommend Hula highly enough, if you are in that part of town, go in and try for yourself.",

Each and every one was lip-smackingly good and you even get a list of when you drink each juice, so your energy levels stay up.

I'm sure the wide selection of juices on offer will do the owner proud. Smoothies are a bit steep - it's almost 4 for some of them. But for a treat you could do an awful lot worse!   Pleasant ambience in the cafe - plenty of seats to rest your weary toosh, and there's a section through the back if it's all looking busy when you first step in the door.

I saw loosely because the decor consisted of a few hula skirts.   They offer a range of smoothies and will even add anti oxidants or energy boosts to your chosen drink. I had a Betty Ford smoothie, which I think was banana, peach and I'm going to say strawberry. See that is why I'm not a huge smoothie fan, because they all taste the same no matter what you put in them. After I ordered I noticed Tiffin Milkshake was the special of the day and was gutted I hadn't gone for that. The nice girl made the smoothie in front of me while multi tasking by serving the people seated as well. Hula also do sandwiches and soup so great for a quick lunch. Not too overpriced either considering it is in tourist territory.",

I left feeling completely satisfied and happy with the meal. As I strolled by the storefront about 10 minutes later, a staff member was setting up chairs outside and flagged me down, saying she was so happy to catch me because she had accidentally charged me a few pounds too much.

There were several types of fruit, all of it ripe, delicious, and beautifully presented. My husband had a pesto & chicken bagel with brie, which he loved. I'll admit, I was eyeing up everyone's food at our neighboring tables, and everything looked scrumptious...especially the thick slices of whole grain toast with peanut butter. Yum. Unfortunately, I have to knock off a star for the rather slow service...our empty plates sat in front of us for ages while our server absentmindedly peeled fruit behind the counter.

After reading through the menu of porridge options I decided to go with their popular honey and blueberry porridge. I thoroughly enjoyed this with it's natural sweetness... and they give you a HUGE bowl of it.

The atmosphere is lively and bright and the menu has some really delightful looking bagels that I unfortunately couldn't partake in as we were to eat soon. I hesitated between a milkshake and some frozen yogurt (the obvious choices on a cold rainy day, no?) and opted for the latter topped with fruit coulis and granola. My boyfriend had green tea and a slice of carrot cake. I have to say I'm not a hardcore carrot cake fan but it was really good. He had never tried it and was also impressed.   What's more you get 10% off the bill for checking in on Yelp. If I was actually living in Edinburgh and not just visiting, I could see this place being a regular stop for me!",

On a warm, sunny beautiful day in Edinburgh my esteemed colleague and I popped in for a healthful lunch. I had the Mexican hot wrap (tuna, avocado, veggies) and the house salad (bleu cheese, walnuts, apples)...GORGEOUS. Simply wonderful, and just what I had wanted.   Followed with a delicious smoothie (hold the banana!) with rasperries, strawberries, blueberries and an antioxidant booster for good measure I felt a wee spring in my step as I exited.   The staff are ever-so-lovely and unfailingly helpful. The place is a rainbow of colors and offerings, many items gluten-free, veggie-friendly, etc. Their listings of juices, smoothies, boosters and concoctions must be unparalleled! ALL THE JUICE. ALL THE FRUITS. ALL THE VEGGIES. (And some cakes, for good measure, of course!)   A must-stop in Edinburgh, will not disappoint .  *free wifi (easy connection, passwords on tables!)  *many outside tables in good weather, great location on a beautiful, bustling street.",

Yes, ok, that probably raised my expectations quite high!  Cute place, love the colorfulness. Looked for healthy options but ended up with the bagel with salmon and tomato soup. It was 'OK', nothing extraordinary... I do have to say I might be a little spoiled healthy food places wise, but so 'healthy' I wouldn't call bagels with some toppings. Another time I had the chicken pesto bagel to go but all the chicken was on 1 side and the fresh tomato on the other.  Quite steep prices and nothing that blew me away... Have not found other 'healthier' options around yet so I do understand the popularity, but really a bit under impressed. They do are very proud of their status here on yelp and offer a special discount when you check in in the restaurant! At least at the time I was there.  Not bad, not amazing, quite expensive, cute interior, thats it...",

Those huge oversized polo shaped guiltiness can be filled with a variety of things, but I went for the unhealthiest you can manage in this shop, cream cheese.  They also do lots of nice things, and super coloured juices that I am slightly afraid of.  Great place to get a quick bite while in the grassmarket.",

Their wifi is great and there are loads of small tables so you don't need to take up lots of space or feel the need to be rushed out.  The service was great - happy workers equal happy customers.   If I'm being honest, my salad looked a lot better than it tasted. Don't get me wrong, it was perfectly nice, but just lacking in some thought about the mixture of flavours. I got carrot and coriander soup though which was lovely and hearty, if a bit on the thin side.   I would go back.",

If I stop here for lunch I go for the wrap and soup deal. Not only a tasty wrap and bowlful, it's awesome for value too. I ponder usually on what wrap I go for as I get stuck between the veggie and the tuna!

First of all, there's nothing worse than opting for the healthy option and then having to endure tasteless, boring rabbit food. That's miserable, quite frankly, and nobody wants to pay for that! Luckily for Edinburgh, Hula serves nice healthy food that you can feel good about eating, that tastes amazing!  To drink, I had the Pop-Eye juice, whose main component was spinach, if I recall correctly. Now, for me, choosing to drink spinach is a bold move, and always a risk... but it tasted fab! It was just fruity enough to take the edge of the vegetables, but not so fruity that it felt like it was packed with sugar. The portion was large and it was freshly made right there and then (as it should be) by the lovely and friendly staff. All in all, a great (healthy) juice!  I then had their hummus salad to eat, which was equally delicious. Packed with flavour, this dish was full of great taste, textures and ingredients. I finished the whole thing and felt decidedly satisfied at the end of it! :)  The place itself is very cute too, though it was a little noisy at points because of the juicing! We also suffered a little wifi breakdown while we were there, however I'm still marking these guys as a 5 star, because if you want perfect wifi, go to Starbucks! The menu and food here was too good to deduct a star for technical difficulties, in my opinion!   What a great little find in Edinburgh! I'll be back here again, for sure!",

Aurelie M and I were lucky to get a table - we arrived right at the start of the lunch wave; ten minutes later and it could have been curtains for our lunch plans. Lacy, gently wafting curtains...  I opted for the Cajun wrap, which was wonderful, toasted to crispness on the outside and burrito-like in contents. With the side salad it was the perfect amount. I also had the Betty Ford juice, which was delicious and tasted very wholesome. I tried Aurelie's Pink lady too and it was SO GOOD. I want a whole one to myself!  Aside from a slightly perfuctory dump-dishes-and-run moment from the staff member so brought our orders (totally understandable given that the place was packed by then) this was a wonderful experience from start to finish and we never felt rushed to move on despite the people who never stopped appearing.",

All of which can be accompanied with something from their selection of freshly squeezed juices, smoothies or coffees and teas.   This place definitely has its dietary options down. Gluten free, vegan, they've got it covered with loads of options for making certain dishes vegan if they aren't on the menu.   I'm a little guilty of ordering the same chicken pesto bagel when I'm here so I don't have a great idea of how good everything else is on the menu. The juices and smoothies are amazing however. I've tried almost all of them and they're all delicious. The added boosters make them even healthier! Today I am enjoying the delightfully festive got Apple pie smoothie. Apple, cinnamon, hint of ginger, heated up! Yummo!   The coffee here is some of the best I've tasted in Edinburgh too.   Another very cool thing about hula is that it's not just a cafe, it's a gallery too. The place is full of bright colourful art from a different local artist every few months. There are also other things like Christmas cards and loose teas for sale here too. It's a lovely representation of how into local business Hula are, sharing their space for mutual benefit!",

It is well-located right off of Grassmarket on the sloping Victoria Street (filled with its own delicious wonders), and was the husband and my favorite place for breakfast during our few days exploring the city.  The staff was incredibly friendly and gave helpful recommendations, not just about the fare but also about local places to check out around Edinburgh.  Their porridge made me really love Scottish porridge, and their hot drinks (teas, coffee, espresso drinks) were well made.  It was also the first place where we tried a flat white, which hasn't made its way to the \"colonies\" (aka the US).  And they stock our favorite porridge bars (a great upgrade from the sad, hard granola bars we know across the Atlantic).  I know Hula is called a juice bar, but for some odd reason - perhaps the hour of the day - we never got juice there.  Next time, though!  I'm looking forward to dropping in on our next visit.",

The only thing I personally would like is more of a cross over time between breakfast and lunch options, or even all day breakfast options!

We grabbed a seat out the back (this area didn't used to be there, did it?) and were pleased to see they have table service. I had a mint tea (properly brewed with actual mint leaves) and a piece of carrot cake which was just divine.   While the wifi out the back isn't amazing, I didn't let that spoil my visit. I can't wait to come back to properly try out the food!   Note: they have customer loos and lots of seating, but it does get really busy as the place is very popular!",

    "text": "Managed to nab a seat during lunchtime rush on a busy Saturday in the city. Although small the cafe has a nice amount of seating and doesn't feel too crowded even when full which is nice.   Myself and my lunch date were both feeling something light so opted for salads: the watermelon olive and feta for myself and fig and prosciutto for my mum. These we accompanied with a Popeyes and oscars smoothie respectively. The juices came quickly and were both delicious, light and nutritious. The salads soon followed and lived up to expectations. The watermelon salad was bursting with fresh juicy watermelon, balanced with salty feta and topped with a sweet dressing and seed mix.  While the smoothies were expensive at 4 pounds for a regular size you can't really expect anything else for fresh juice? I would recommend Hula for anyone looking for a light fresh lunch and intend on coming back ASAP to sample the extensive breakfast menu!",

But we were actually looking to work on our laptops so chillaxing wasn't the number 1 agenda item and with on and off wifi it was very much perfect for the heavy brainstorming we had in mind as opposed to internet heavy donkey work!  Great selection of cakes (the carrot and caramel brownie were great) and coffee was tasty. I didn't venture into juice land but seemed pretty good in terms of selection.   Good stuff!",

If you're looking for a boost then the hot apple pie has ginger and cinnamon so will keep you going through the afternoon.

    "text": "Our hotel was literally around the corner from Hula, on Grassmarket Square, we discovered Hula Juice Bar on our first morning, when we had hearty, long-cooked oatmeal (porridge) and a pot of tea. After our first experience, we ate there almost every day. Many mornings, I had a bowl of flavorful, creamy yogurt with fresh local fruit and granola (pictured).  Hula is way more than a juice bar - there are soups, salads, wraps, and, at dinner, a hot dish. Although much of it is vegetarian, there is also chicken on the menu. I heartily recommend their soup of the day - someone in the kitchen has superb skills when it comes to seasoning, and I (a very choosy eater) throughly enjoyed everything I had there. Try a soup of the day with a slab of their \"doorstop bread\" with melted cheese! And enjoy trying out some of the great smoothie/juice choices.  The atmosphere is informal and cheerful. They seat you quickly, and the people who work there are very friendly. On our second morning, our server greeted us with, \"Welcome back!\"",

    "text": "As one of the few predominant vegan options in Edinburgh, we had high hopes for Hula, so much so that we came back to the restaurant on 4 different occasions during the month of August.  The Food: fresh ingredients, tasty and decently prepared.  The Service: waitresses are uninformed about the food that they are serving. Not only are the ingredients in the food not listed on the menu, when you ask the waitresses what is in the food they don't know.  We asked about the mixed veggies in one of the sandwiches and the waitress couldn't even tell us whether it was cooked or raw. When we asked what was in it she listed the wrong ingredients and we spoke with her 3 different times before she finally went and asked.  I ordered the rainbow bowl and it came with ingredients different than what was listed on the board and different than what the waitress told me. On another occasion we ordered the vegan poke bowl and it came with avocado smash which we didn't order. When we asked her if we'd be charged for it she looked confused and then informed us that they were out of tofu and automatically replaced it, only asking if it was okay after we'd been served. If you have food allergies, I would absolutely avoid this restaurant.  Ps: it was different wait staff each time.   Tldr: the food was good if you don't mind not knowing what you're getting, but not worth the rude and incompetent service.",

It was a little tricky to find because it wasn't exactly where Yelp said it was ( turned out it was slightly more down the block on the next street).  The place was in high attendance and has both inside and outside seating. And there is definitely more space inside than pictures let on so don't be afraid to bring a group and take a seat!  My only complaint about the atmosphere was that the temperature was a little warmer than I think was generally comfortable.  They have free wifi there so it would seem like a good place to get some work done, provided you're put off by all the noise of people talking and the noise from the machines preparing food.  Bottom line: a good place to stop off from your weary touristy travels of sightseeing and window shopping. Give yourself a break (and a boost) and go to Hula's!",

It's literally impossible not to feel healthy here  - from the quirky patio furniture to the tea towels on the walls and astroturf at the front, you basically lose three pounds just walking in the door* (*results may vary).  I frequent this place most when i'm feeling a wee bit homesick. It's a little snippet of my yoga crazy, green juice chugging, home town tucked away in the Grassmarket.   Like most brilliant health conscious places - they make you feel good about eating cream cheese. I'm serious, you will feel like a million bucks for choosing that smoked salmon and cream cheese bagel. Is it the healthiest thing on the menu? Heck no. But you're also having a peppermint tea and a green juice, so that cancels out any harm caused by your full fat dairy indulgence: science.  This theory works with most of their menu. Delicious, healthy options with a heck ton of cheese - often melted. God bless you Hula.  Don't get me wrong, if you want to go the True blue health route, it has you covered as well. From heart healthy salads to house made soup - you can find a decent meal here with or without cheese cheating.  Bonus points for gluten free options.  It also boasts the best juice selection i've found thus far in Edinburgh and *drum roll please* - they carry green juice! Add a scoop of frozen yogurt and have a double lunch!  Hula will continue to be my go-to when I want to feel hip, healthy and/or need a quirky spot to host a lunch meeting. My only complaint? I wish they had better wifi. This gal needs to internet gush 24/7.",

I let my mom test it (we love bowls) and she agreed something was off. My mother also ordered an avocado toast, juice, and a regular latte. She liked the avocado toast a lot and said the juice was amazing. I don't remember the exact one she chose but I think it was ginger flavored. Overall, not sure I would come back here.

I ordered the avocado toast and decided on the pink lady juice. I don't drink juice often, but this did not seem like it was made correctly. It was a simple four ingredient drink, but all I could taste was an overwhelming ginger. I tried a few more sips but could not even, it was just too strong. I would have complained if anyone asked me how my food or drink was, but I was never checked on. The avocado toast was pretty tasty, but I have never seen so much avocado on toast!! I had to scrap off what seemed like an entire avocado worth. After finishing my meal and placing napkins over my plate I still could not get my servers attention to get a bill or to say anything. I eventually came to the counter to ask if I pay here. I got a \"sure\" although I think I saw others receive a bill at the table. When they asked how my food was I said the drink was overwhelmingly ginger and I just got a \"oh yeah sorry\" and that was it.",

The mix of vanilla, bananas, maca and almond milk is such a delicious base and then top it with blueberries, granola and the ever crave worthy peanut butter, this is complete happiness! Wowza!

I got mine with smoked salmon on it, and I loved the combination of tomato oil, avocado, chili flakes/seeds/salt, greens and lime. It was so flavorful and had a tiny bit of a kick thanks to the chili flakes. The smoked salmon was definitely worth the added 1.50. I also got the Pink Lady juice, which is a blended juice of apple, lemon, lime and ginger. It was a nice refreshing drink that soothed my post-flight stomach. The cafe is pretty big, although a little cramped, but you shouldn't have any trouble seating a few people around lunch time.",

Note that they have extra seating in the back.   We tried the avocado toast, several smoothies, and the acai bowl. The bowl was kind of small and our smoothies weren't as cold as I would have liked, but they were okay.   The avocado toast was yummy - the chili/tomato paste they use as a base was a much-needed addition. I wish they would use more of it. They give a very generous amount of avocado. The second time it was almost an unreasonable amount of avocado for the size of the toasts . Perhaps order an extra piece of toast if you want an easier time eating it. The only thing I wish the avo toast featured was a unique garnish that would zest it up. Maybe some spicy pickled onions or some lime.",

I tried ordering their avocado toast, but unfortunately, they didn't have that at the time--no matter though, because everything else on their menu looks amazing! I've had their acai bowl (vegan + gluten-free, with a blend of acai, banana, strawberries, blueberries + coconut milk and topped with toasted coconut shavings, chia seeds, blueberries, cacao nibs, gluten-free granola + banana slices), and also their sriracha chicken wrap, which I took along with me to a hike up Arthur's Seat.  Their Sunshine In A Cup smoothie (also vegan + gluten-free) has mangoes, peaches, pineapples, and oranges in it. :] Definitely was an awesome way to start the day!   I have no idea how I managed to miss the fact that they have poke bowls here, because I would've jumped on that otherwise! *-*  The juice bar has a very casual and friendly vibe, not unlike the cafes in Hawai'i where I got my acai bowls the year before! They're open every day from 8am-6pm, and are an awesome place to check out for breakfast, lunch, or a snack! Indoor + outdoor seating available! :]",

I ask the server at 9:30 a.m. if it was too early to get soup and she says, \"It's never too early for soup!\" My kind of place. I ordered a chicken corn chowder which seems to have pureed potatoes as part of the soup base and comes with great thick slices of crusty grain bread and butter. Yummy and just the thing to warm up with.  Later in the day, I returned for a large Orange & mango smoothies w/ energy boost. This too was good. The business has a great vibe with locals, international visitors speaking multiple languages, friendly staff, good eats, and wifi. This was another place I was lucky to stumble upon that I remembered reading about in Yelper Jenny L's reviews.  Well worth checking out.",

I don't know how anyone can say they don't like fruit, when the magic of a blender can sort you out with any combination of edible items you like in a tasty juicetastic form.   Hula does in fact feel a bit Hawaiian, or like a cafe you'd go to abroad at any rate, and it has a really cool vibe to it, with equally cool and banterful staff.

So, after a long absence I went by Hula again for a proper juice and lo-and-behold: they have changed the chairs and benches to fit people of my legginess! Ooooh. I am a very, very happy camper indeed.  I had the soup and my girl-date had the bagel with added bacon, nom, and the Pink Lady Juice. It was absolutely hilarious to see her geek out over such delicious flavours, as she had never been to Hula before. I think the terms \"Seventh Heaven\" and \"Organic Squee\" were mentioned. I'm pretty sure that Hula has a new regular customer!  My soup was lovely, and my Dutch sensibilities were sufficiently freaked out by eating soup out of a bowl on a slope (this is scary to me, my country is flat) to not notice the somewhat less comfy seating outside on the terrace.  I love this place, and what they stand for. The healthiness of it, the organic nature. I love it. What's not to love? I'll clearly be back again.  If I'd have to suggest something, it'd be that the waiting staff, though lovely, needs some organisation. There was no menu for us to order at the counter, and the waiting staff seemed incredibly frazzled running all over the place, but it was a Saturday, and that might have been why. Either way, they're friendly, if a little frazzled, and that's all I care about. Go here? STAY here, that's my advice.",

I really need to toughen up!!       Obviously Hula is as popular as ever, mobbed today (bank holiday Monday) and perhaps the only real downside was I felt the staff were running to stand still.  My juice arrived after I'd finished my bagel and my partner's coffee midway through her breakfast.  Staff were very apologetic about the wait and you could tell this wasn't the norm.

It's also a little cramped, which makes it awkward for customers trying to get past tables to find a seat. The staff were very friendly and attentive, I also think its value for money. While they do advertise free WiFi, I couldn't access it at the back if the cafe. I'm still giving them 4 stars as the proof is in the number of customers they had in and the quality of their food was excellent.",

It seems every man and his dog offers smoothies these days without actually doing the product any service, Hula on the other hand know exactly how to make them and damn they're good. Inexpensive too.  Also, the staff are warm and inviting, seemingly taking pride in making your face beam with a sip of their goodness packed delights.",

    "text": "Hula smoothies are as addictive as crack...FACT. The good news is that they are a million times healthier for you than a class A drug.   When I need a little pick me up there is nothing better than a Hula Blue Hawaiian smoothie. I've even gone out of my way to go and get one from their cafe in the Grassmarket, they're that good! (Usually its gulped greedily down at such a speed that head freeze is a forgone conclusion...patience is not my forte.)  But Hula don't just serve fabulous healthy smoothies, they do amazing food too. The soup and a sandwich deal is brilliant value so I usually have a chicken pesto bagel and soup when I drop in for food.   But what I love most of all is how friendly and accommodating the place is. There's a great, almost bohemian, vibe to the place and a warm glow that seems to tempt you in from the cold during the winter months. I have a food intolerance so I have to make some changes to my food and drinks orders, but this is never a hassle with the staff and they'll even go out of their way to suggest alternatives that wont make me ill.   Roll on the summer months, I'm dying to sit outside on a table in the sunshine enjoying my smoothie.",

It looks great - still quirky and cosy but a bit more modern in its stylings. I had a whirling Dervish which was a delight of tangy flavour. My friend had a Ginger something or other which was pretty good I think - well she didn't let me have any so I assume that it was good!   Anyway this was about my dozenth or more visit to hula and I felt it was time to review it. So although today I only had a smoothie - in the past I've had soups, sandwiches, bagels, cakes and other exciting things!  So the five stars is not just for today but for the whole Hulaexperience.

A huge range of fruit (and some very odd 'alternatives') smoothies and juice drinks is well priced, and freshly made in front of you. If however, a super berry smoothies isnt your thing, Hula does coffes and teas as well, with snack food at a reasonable price.  One of three local stores, the grass market Hula has a performance area for local musicians, so the atmposhpere is very relaxed and chilled out.  A great little find, and I will be coming here more often than I go to the shops for carrots and brocolli.",

After viewing a few, less than exciting places in Haymarket I wandered back into town and immediately headed right in this welcoming little cafe. Smoothies, yum, Bagels, yes please!! It was lovely the first time round although I did not hang around too much.  Today I met up with Jenny for a nice leisurely breckie. What could be better for you than a lovely smoothie jam-packed with fruits. How very healthy of me. Great thing is that we both wanted something a little different from the menu, I wanted cheddar instead of brie with my bacon croissant and Jenny prefers her porridge made with water and not milk. Not a problem.  Bonus of going with someone who is clearly a regular - we got to try a new juice the owner is mixing up at the mo. Beetroot, apple, lime/lemon, and ginger. It would have been very nice except me and ginger try to avoid each other, he always leaves a nasty taste in my mouth.   Overall a great little place tucked away down in the Grassmarket. Although I do find myself drooling over the selection of shoes as well as the food!!!",

    "text": "Nice zingy green/mixed juices, creative fruit smoothies, and hearty wraps, lighter salads, one or two soups of the day. In a town of haggis, potatoes, fish and chips, the option of detox and immune \"boosters\" is a refreshing break! But for the less angelic eaters, there are also bagel sandwiches, milkshakes, and yummy looking cakes brownies and shortbreads. You can grab or go, but better to sit and stay a while with the wifi and quirky lighthearted atmosphere.",

    "text": "Hula is kind of like ... a hug. I know lots of people love it, but I really didn't expect a  juice bar to make me feel so cosy and friendly and happy!   I had a Pink Lady which is apple, lemon, ginger and ... something. Can't remember, but it was delicious. And orange. Okay, pinky-orange. There's lots more seating inside than I imagined, free wifi, the friendliest staff, and I got a 10 percent Yelp discount!   The only downside, and it's maybe a silly one, is that I'd like my drink in a glass when sitting in, rather than a takeaway tumbler. That just would feel nicer, I think. But it's only a little thing, and I'll definitely be back for another juice hug.",

Soup & a bagel/sandwich for 5.00 is an amazing lunch deal, the haggis soup is must try. They serve good coffee and a nice variety of cakes, one of my favourite places in town.",
