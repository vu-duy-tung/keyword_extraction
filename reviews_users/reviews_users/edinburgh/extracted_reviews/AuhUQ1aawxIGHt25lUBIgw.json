    "text": "I was a guest at the Hub for three days as part of a Marketing Conference. It is a beautiful venue with very friendly staff who looked after us expertly. Often times, Conference venues can let themselves down with the simple things such as making sure delegates have enough drinking water and snacks. The Hub had no such problems with the staff being dutiful.   The venue itself is gorgeous, with high ceilings in the Amphitheatre and a great vibe. There is also a quiet backstage space for speakers to conduct interviews and prepare.   The Wi-Fi at the venue was complimentary, but sadly, like so many free Wi-Fi offerings, failed to cope with 120+ attendees trying to use it with connections timing out and failing.  I didn't get an opportunity to try the tourist visitor area downstairs, but I spotted a Cafe and some relaxing spaces.   Great venue that I'd highly recommend to any conference organisers. I'd give this venue 5 stars if they could install some conference strength Wi-Fi facilities, as this is a must for any modern conference guest.",

    "text": "We walked by The Hub a couple of times before actually deciding to go in for lunch. It was a near thing, but I'm glad we chose to stop here.  The building is impressive on its own, and the space that The Hub occupies is just as lovely. There are leaded, tall windows that let in a lot of natural light right next to modern art and chrome. It doesn't sound like it should work, but it does.  The dining room is warm and inviting, with tables for dining and couches for relaxing. They have a pastry bar up front, if you're so inclined, or a full kitchen in the back.  We were shown to a table right away, and placed our drink orders - chai latte for me, regular latte for him - before taking our time with the menu. Most of the things looked really good, so it was hard for me to choose, but I eventually decided to go with a half sandwich (smoked salmon) and the soup of the day (creamy tomato). My husband got the mushroom risotto.  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful, and seemed almost reluctant to interrupt us if we were in the middle of a conversation. But, she was sweet and efficient, which we both really appreciated.  The food was actually really good! I didn't expect a whole lot, to be honest, but the quality was there. I enjoyed my sandwich - the fish was smoked without being too smoky, and was served on artisan bread with condiments and a small salad on the side. My husband's risotto was the clear winner, though. I shamelessly helped myself to more than one spoonful off of his plate, and was surprised to find that the risotto was creamy and full of flavor. It was also a rather large serving, which was a bonus, since I couldn't stop myself from eating off his plate.  This was a very good find - from the location to the service to the food. Had we more time in the city, we would have absolutely gone back for another meal.",

    "text": "The service is perfectly friendly and the atmosphere has a nice cultured feel.  It is a bit robotic and not very personal, but perfectly decent.  Like many restaurants that are attached to  larger galleries, theatres and so on,, there is slight feeling of leaning on being a central place of culture.  If this restaurant was not attached to a central place of culture I am not sure it would be full or even surviving.  We have the soup which was fine, not good not bad just fine.  The desserts were a small collection of cakes and pastries in the corner that somehow were not massively appealing.  A nice place if you're wanting to be in a cultural building, but the restaurant in itself is nothing remarkable.  If you are wanting a place where can hang out for ages, relaxing and chatting with friends and not be pushed out.   Then this might be the place for you, as that of course presents much greater value for money.  This probably is why it is full more from older people and families who could happily while away the hours there.  This factor also makes it more popular with locals.  I made the mistake of not checking in on Yelp before paying the bill, I should have done so and gotten in the offer.  Then the lower price may have meant it would have been worth more stars!",

Great food and lovely set-up. The colors in the main hall are garish and take away from the beautiful aspects of the carved ceiling, I feel. But it didn't detract too much from the lovely and intimate balcony setting of the wedding itself and the great space in the hall for the reception dinner and dance.   They were a bit let down with service. It was here and there. Great at some times and totally lacking at others. The manager for the day was clearly present, but didn't always keep her staff on the same page. Our table barely got dessert. This was sad because I love cake.   Very beautiful setting that lends itself well to smaller and larger groups, as I experienced.",

The hub is situated centrally near Edinburgh castle and a convenient place to hold events or to enjoy a quick coffee downstairs in the coffee shop.  The event  I joined was arranged from work and we had plenty of space to wonder around, enjoy a few drinks and being seated comfortably to dine in an interesting environment. I believe the room we were in contained an altar and praying space in past times. What do we expect, it was a church, once .....! Having said this, I liked the quirky touches to the room, which still maintained some of the churches character.  The room was very well prepared for the afternoon and evening entertainment. The staff was really friendly and helpful.  The food was nice, the wine ok and the ambient efficient.  Would I recommend this place for certain business events ? Yes I would. Would I recommend this place for private parties? Not sure. I assume it depends on how personal your taste......and for what you want to book the rooms for....  I also want to mention that I have only seen one section of this place and hopefully one day I will be able to see more.",

The Hub is housed in a really striking renovated church building near the top of the Royal Mile, and is a pretty clear landmark for anyone trying to navigate their way around the Old Town.  I've been to the Assembly Hall upstairs in the Hub, plus another one of the smaller rooms for an arts event, and they both provided a pleasant atmosphere for socialising and relaxing. The interior of the Hub is bright and modern, in contrast to the gothic exterior of the building. The cafe comes well recommended, with its selection of hearty breakfast and lunch options, all at inexpensive prices.",

Converted from a beautiful church, this main festival venue, which can be hired out for functions, also contains a large cafe restaurant. The beautiful church facade is unfortunately a little let down by the modern interior.  I've been to the Hub cafe a few times to meet people for coffee or lunch on businessy sort of meetings. Its a fantastic location, right at the top of the Mile and just around the corner from the castle. This is probably the main cause for the Hub's business.  Despite the beautiful building and the convenient location the cafe isn't the best. It serves ordinary sorts of teas and coffees and light lunches. The lunches themselves aren't terrible, after finally extending their menu, but the prices are. For what you get, which is fairly small portions of \"fancy\" food dressed up, the cost is too much. In the past the staffing has been too slow and a bit inconsistent.  A great location venue but with a poor cafe and a lot of room for improvement,",

It also doubles as an event venue, and has private meeting room upstairs, in this structure that dominates the city skyline...but for me I have yet to fully experience a show or some food here.  For me the its location is fairly central in an converted church, now a regional meeting place where its quiet enough to escape the hussle and bussle of outside, during busy tourist season!  Enjoy the shop, free maps and guides, chatting to Hub staff finding out if there are any tickets left for usual sold out events that Edinburgh is famous for, and the afternoon weekend teas are great as well as weddings and pre-tattoo suppers.  They have wifi, not sure if it is free but according to the ticket staff, you cant get access to www from the shop area but possibly need a password from the restaurant staff.

We actually went here just before we went to a gig in The Hub itself, and really enjoyed the food. The decor is of the traditional church interior, except painted bright yellow, with glass panels separating it from the venue.   We took advantage of the lunch time soup and sandwich deal for 5, which runs from noon till 3pm. I had a nice tomato and red pepper soup with a plain cheese sandwich on brown bread, and it was just what the doctor ordered! We were starving and it was nice, home-made comfort food which was perfect for what we wanted.  Nice yummy food but not too sure about the yellow decor! A little mismatched for the building.",

(reminder a flat white is essentially a double shot latte in a normal size tea cup) they do table service which isn't built for speed so you do need to be a little bit patient. the coffee was too hot but not completely scalding. it tasted like hot, bitter milk with some saving graces of flavour, but not many. it was reasonably strong which was in it's favour but no milk texture and flabby, whipped egg white-like froth popped on top for effect. i have to admit i expected worse in the epicentre of tourist-ville but it definitely rates as bad coffee. to rest your weary legs when you're on the sightseeing trail though, it's a nice enough spot to relax. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fedinburghcoffeelovers.blogspot.com%2F&s=47cb50a04dcbf1685d7e5617e7d2ff7d74789e9d1b9310e46ae725be053e7eb6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">edinburghcoffeelovers.bl...</a> twitter: @edinburghcoffee",
