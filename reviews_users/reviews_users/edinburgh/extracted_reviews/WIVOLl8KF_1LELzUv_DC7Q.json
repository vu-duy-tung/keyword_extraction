    "text": "Just opposite Doodles, Ceramic experience looks like a bad copy of the original. However, great opportunity for kids' play with pottery painting and a good cafe area for the parents. One of the small attractions of the place is the ball pool. If you like silver jewllery perhaps the shop could interest you in their latest idea - miniprints silver piece of necklace. You can have the prints of your little ones on a silver plate hanging on a silver chain around your neck for the rest of your days. It might sound a bit unaesthetic but do have a look at the sample on the webpage and judge for yourself.",

    "text": "This is definitely a kid-friendly place as there is a soft play area attached. This is great if you have kids, however, I don't so it was a little irritating as the kids seem to run loose in the shop. Having said that, a good place. Very friendly and helpful service. A good selection of ceramics to choose from. The paint selection is not as good as it could be, a few added colours would do the trick. In its quiet moments....a very relaxing experience.",
