    "text": "One of my favorite places to pop in for a quick sandwich or snack. There's one on almost every corner it seems like through most of England and Western Europe. Everything is fresh and ready to go. You'll be in and out in a number of minutes, ready to get on with the rest of your day. Over the past few years they've been adding more and more options, but my favorite is still one of their great sandwiches. Try the ultimate BLT!",

Yeah, they might make the sammiches on the premises, they might make everything fresh on the day. With the exception of whichever herbs it is that they fly in from whichever middle eastern country it is, they don't contribute to airfreight. They may well label everything with a calorie count, so you know exactly how fat it's going to make you... They may well do all of this, but it's still Micky D's in disguise right?   Well, here's the thing, the staff, and a couple in particular, always have a smile for you. That is just as addictive as the spectacular posh cheddar and pickle baguette, or the ham, cheese and mustard toastie... or the superfood salad... hell, it's just nice to get a nice smile :)",

    "text": "Yet another branch of Pret A Manger dotted around Edinburgh, this one is well organised, has friendly staff and always has an excellent selection of freshly made goodies. I can't get enough of Pret and can honestly say I haven't found a bad branch yet.  After doing a spot of shopping in Habitat just further up the road, I decided to sit down here for a cup of tea, a cheese ploughmans sandwich and a slice of millionaires shortcake. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have my favourite chilli prawn subs left but the cheese ploughmans was outstanding so I'll let it slide. The shortcake that followed was also delicious, very moreish and I could have probably eaten about three but I decided I should just stick with having one.",

    "text": "I've only recently came round to the joys of Pret a Manger and while there's not a branch close enough to my work to merit regular visits, there's a couple of snacky options that I'll regularly drop in for when I fancy a nibble on the go.  They do excellent yoghurt / compote / muesli things that make me feel moderately healthy at breakfast time and much to my delight, they've also begun doing huge pretzels for a pound. Not as good as the big salty buggers you get in Deutschland, but a good substitute.  I was somewhat parched the other day so also went for a can of their fancy-looking fizzy orange. It's fantastic, almost as good as the San Pelligrino stuff you find in Italian takeaways.",
