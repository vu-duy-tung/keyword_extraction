    "text": "I've been meaning to visit New Chapter since it took over this location a few months ago but it seems to be keeping busy and was often fully booked at weekends.  I came here for lunch on Sunday; it's a nice bright venue and when it's busy it has a nice atmosphere. It's a good place to come for a relaxed but more sophisticated lunch with a glass of wine.  I had a crispy poached eggs and sprouting broccoli as a starter which was cooked perfectly and was delicious. I went for the main course of coley, beans and artichoke and for dessert a brownie with honeycomb and ice-cream.  It isn't trying to do anything to outlandish; it is just simple well-executed classic dining.   The reason that I've pushed up into 5 star territory is the price. At 9.50 for a two course lunch of this quality it seems like ridiculously good value. I couldn't fault the food or service at all and the portion sizes were reasonable.  I'd probably still come in the evening and pay the full prices (which seem to be around 15 a person) but once you get into that price range competition becomes a bit stiffer.   For a weekend lunch though under a tenner I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "My date suggested New Chapter and I was hesitant because of my 'vegan fluid' (read 'vegetarian in a pinch') diet. But when we couldn't find the other restaurant we were looking for, we went in. First of all, the place is lovely and the wait staff were immediately kind and welcoming. We sat at a table in back and ordered. I ordered the wild mushroom arancini (fried rice balls with cheese) and potato gnocchi main. Oh, man, they were both out of this world! The arancini had two 'creme' dips and both (separately and together) the black garlic and (white) black truffle was just marvelously flavorful! The balls were fried to perfection and topped with pecorino. I could've ordered 3 plates for my main although then I would've missed the potato gnocchi. Gnocchi can often be two dense and too rich but these little dumplings were lighter than air and perfectly complemented by the sauce it came with. (The plating for all our dishes was also quite beautiful.) We ordered the side green beans with hazelnuts which were cooked to perfection; I mean really!! For desert, we had the wild blackberries with (I believe) coconut ice cream and sorbet - which I can't imagine weren't made in house. The ice cream was so dense and creamy I was in heaven. It seems like they change their menu weekly/monthly - if not daily - so I apologize for not getting the details correct (our menu was not on their website for me to confirm) but open the book and treat yourself to this New Chapter!",

    "text": "For a restaurant which has been open three weeks, this is a very smooth operation.   Looked it out for dinner based on a friend's recommendation as it was close to the botanic gardens where we'd been for botanic lights.   Quick look at the menu in the window and we were impressed with the options and more importantly the price point!   We were greeted at the door and able to take our pick of tables. Menus were produced and water brought promptly. Our wines were brought quickly and starters didn't take too long to arrive.   The restaurant filled up quite a bit and with a large table in, the atmosphere was quite lively, but not too loud.  Our plates were cleared once we'd finished and there was a good amount of time before mains. They were happy to give us a break before dessert as well.   All three courses were delicious, everything perfectly cooked and flavours well paired.   For the quality of food and price, top marks! Would happily go back if I'm in the area, can happily recommend it.",

The menu is limited to 5-6 choices for each course, which is not in itself a bad thing, but when you are a vegetarian who is tired of eating risotto, it can bring down your interest level. (Chefs of Edinburgh, why do you think vegetarian food consists primarily of risotto (or gnocchi)? Who taught you this? How do I get you to un-learn it?) As the menu at New Chapter changes with what's in season, I have hope that there will be more interesting vegetarian mains in future.   This place feels promising, but not quite there yet. Most of the food was tasty (especially the cream-soaked kale with chestnuts). Service seemed a bit over-stretched at times (we had to ask multiple times for a cooling bucket for our white wine), but was generally good. We'll probably give it another try in a few months or so.",
