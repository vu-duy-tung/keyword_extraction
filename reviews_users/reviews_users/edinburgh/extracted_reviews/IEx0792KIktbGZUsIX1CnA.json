I come here 3 times a week, and have just finished their entire menu. The wraps are all perfectly toasty and flavorful, but I recommend the avocado aubergine or the falafel fuul.",

    "text": "A surprising little gem! I nearly walked away after seeing the place inside. The display cabinet was incredibly bare and looked a bit like a deli that had stopped trying, and the menu items looked too simple to be worth trying. Before I could suggest we continue our search for food, however, my friend had already started ordering. Oh well, I figured, I can at least try it. I went for the falafel and Fuul wrap with cheese, and she the falafel aubergine.  Turns out, the display only shows you a small section of what's actually there.  What happened next was a huge surprise to me! As we bit into our respective wraps, we concluded that they were surprisingly complex to the taste. Every bite had layers of taste, and it really just worked incredibly well. I actually had to put my wrap down for a few minutes to just let the tastes linger in my mouth before I continued eating.  The falafel recipe they use here is different from anything I've tried before, and incorporates dill, which was a bit strange at first, but again: It works!   I will definitely come back here some other time, and you'd do well to give them a go too!",

The wraps are double toasted for the perfect crisp without compromising texture, and of course the flavor is what brings me back five times a week! Once I get my wrap The back room is the perfect relaxed environment to enjoy a wrap and a coffee in the middle of a long day. Oh, did i mention the place is super cheap!?",

    "text": "Well I can definitely attest to the fact that Magnus H returned to this place, because he brought me with him. You see, the Fringe has been a magical place for my brain but hell on my eating habits. Don't get me wrong, it's a pleasant sort of hell, but on mid-day Sunday when I realized that all I had eaten so far was ice cream... steps needed to be taken. I was craving something somewhat healthy and with the options in and around the festival being more of the \"burger and beer\" variety, Magnus suggested we go here.  I actually laughed when I read his review, because the same thing went through my head when I walked in the door: this place looks like it has given up. The little deli counter has a few dishes plunked on it and the menu looked OVERLY simple. But all I had eaten was icecream and even an overly simple falafel would be better than my all dairy diet, so I ordered a wrap and kept my fingers crossed.  Magnus did not steer me wrong: for 4 this wrap was a good size, with a surprising amount of added toppings that magically appeared from under the counter. The ingredients were fresh, it was actually wrapped in a way that makes it perfect for traveling while eating (you'd be surprised on how many wrap places miss this mark) and I agree - the dill in the falafel was surprising but really dang good. It will definitely be added to the places for a quick meal in the area and I daresay, will become a Fringe staple for me for this next week. Worth popping your head in the door.",
