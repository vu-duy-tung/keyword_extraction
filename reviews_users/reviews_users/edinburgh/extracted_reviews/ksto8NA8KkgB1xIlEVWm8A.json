Otherwise, the portions are ridiculously gigantic. A medium is TWO POTATOES! One is more than enough. My friend got the small potato with sweet corn and I got a small potato with the avocado salad. Everything was fresh and simple yet done so well with such flavor! I also do appreciate that they have plenty of vegan and vegetarian options. Great service and atmosphere - we plan on going there a few more times during our stay in Edinburgh.",

I got one with cheese, and if I have one comment it is this: that, my friend, is not a topping. That, is stuffing. I could swear I heard the potato squeel when the friendly boy was ramming the cheese into that poor potato.  Back at home the cheese had become all melty and gooy and my face was one big potato-y mess. But oh man ohmanohman, was I happy.  Joy.  Value for money? Absolutely. Foodcoma? Garantueed.",

    "text": "A popular one with the tourists (as the rave reviews suggest), I guess the Baked Potato Shop is seen as somewhat of a novelty to people visiting Edinburgh for the first time.  It serves up fresh and hearty baked potatoes (no, really?) for a reasonable enough price - although it has the traditional, additional Cockburn St tax. So if you're stopping by for a bit of a stodgy meal, be prepared to empty your wallet of an extra couple of pounds!  Saying that, the portions are generous and well made so you don't begrudge paying the extra money. Cockburn St is a nice location to grab some food, and if it's a nice day you can always sit out on the Royal Mile to savour the fresh air as well as lunch.  It's always packed and it's vegetarian friendly. There are a ton of other pubs and diners in the area which serve up similar potato options, but the homely exterior, great cooking and good service of the Baked Potato Shop keeps the customers coming through the door in their flocks.",

Lots of toppings/fillings to choose from  - certainly some odd ones, but generally all amazing.   Prices are decent for Cockburn Street, and staff are great.

They offer small, medium and large which are not just different size of potatoes, but actually whether you get 1, 2 or 3 whole potatoes. The toppings varied from cheese to curried corn to almost anything in between. We also walked out with two mediums (i.e., 4 potatoes) for less than 5 pounds. It's really hard to argue with that.",

Overall, we said: \"the food from the Baked Potato Shop was first class, and the lunchtime deal represented good value. I'll certainly head back there again, and maybe this time I'll go for one of their famous baked tatties. Now if I could just convince them to dispense with microwaving the soup...\"",

My first job as a school kid was in a baked potato shop, so I have a nostalgic affection for the baked potato as a meal. These guys didn't disappoint.  They were getting smashed me when went in, but the guy who served us was friendly and efficient. And as helpful as we needed him to be.  We ordered the medium size. I was planning on ordering the large as we had been walking around town all day and I generally have a big appetite anyway. But ended up opting for medium. It was perfect. Verging on too much, but that was what I was after. My mother couldn't quite make it to the end, but enjoyed it also.  Their is a good combination of toppings, everything looks fresh and there are a decent selection of treats and drinks.",

I had spicy hummus with a few extras and it was a huge portion and very filling. Nice range of vegan and vege friendly cakes also on offer.  As others have mentioned, as it is a small shop, there isn't a great deal of sitting space but given its close proximity to Princes Street Gardens, I find it quite pleasant to walk downhill and eat my food there. Unfortunately if the weather is bad you might not have many options  which is why it has lost a star.  Food is a 5 though, well worth a visit",

They're huge!  (admittedly, I eat a lot more now, so it's just one meal for me these days)  As far as I am aware they only have veggie toppings.  I'm a meat eater but have no problem with veggie food and when it comes to a BP even prefer the veggie stuff.    Every time I eat here I choose the three bean topping with cheese.  The beans are cold, unfortunately, which means that the cheese doesn't melt, but it doesn't even matter; the taste is phemonenal.    My only gripe is that they have space for about two people to sit in which means that every time I've been here I've had to find a place to sit and eat my meal somewhere around the Mile.  That is fine in nice weather, but we're in Scotland here, and nice weather doesn't come around that often.    But, they work with what they have and do a fantastic job of it.  I'll definitely be coming here next time I have a few after work pints in that region, because I am craving a baked potato now.",

The toppings are pretty impressive too with a staggering range of veggie and vegan options from humous, peppers and avacado to veggie chilli, veggie curry, beans and cheese, coleslaw and cheese, tuna and sour cream.

My one experience here was 2 stars, but as a disclaimer, if I came back and knew what to order and what to stay away from, it could go higher.   I was so excited to see a shop right next to where I was staying in Edinburgh on the Royal Mile with vegan options! This shop is all vegan and vegetarian, which is so cool, and still fairly rare in the UK.   I ordered a small baked potato (the other reviewers are right, a small one is definitely big enough for 2 meals!) and after much consideration, got it topped with baked beans and with avocado. Everything on the menu that is vegan is labeled V for vegan, and apparently they even have vegan butter.   I was starving, so also ordered a packet of crisps and a slice of chocolate cake. (Sometimes after a gal is done climbing Arthur's Seat, she's just gotta carbo-load, ya know?)  When I got back to the flat I was staying in, I excitedly opened my huge and messy baked potato, starving and ready to demolish it. with my hungry girl appetite. I noticed the avocado wasn't actually avocado, but guacamole. That's ok; I wouldn't have ordered guacamole and baked beans, but I was willing to try it. When in Edinburgh, after all. After a few bites, I noticed the guacamole had something else in it. Cheese.   Wah-Wah.  Who puts cheese in guacamole? I get that might be a thing, and some people might like loads of cheese cubes in your avocado dip; hey whatever floats your boat. But at a cafe that caters to vegans and knows what a vegan is, I think it's strange and disappointing to put cheese in a dish that traditionally doesn't call for it. And I hadn't thought to ask if the avocado was vegan, because duh, it's a fruit. I didn't know that avocado meant guacamole, and that their guacamole would have cheese in it. I did ask if the butter was vegan, which I would have super appreciated if the word vegan would have tipped off the gal making my potato.   So I moved on my to my cake. Which tasted like vegan cake from 1977. Very dry and crumbly, not sweet.   But, the server was very nice, and there were lots of options to choose from. If you go and you're vegan, just make sure you ask lots of questions and read the menu carefully.   And now I'm going to move my review up to 3 stars because I'm happy there's a vegan option close in Edinburgh and even though my food didn't work for me, I would try again if I were in the neighborhood/city/country again. And because they were nice.",

You can choose from a variety of toppings, including a slew of vegetarian and vegan options, which is great. The small potato with cheese I ordered was actually two potatoes that were literally covered in cheddar-y goodness. Very messy, very hot, and very good. The toppings may look like too much at first, but there is enough to last through the whole thing and never leave any bare potato. Once you reach the skin, if you still have any room left in your stomach, eat the skin. It is delicious.   If you can, upon receiving your warm and crispy potato, find a place to sit (Scottish weather permitting), and enjoy people-watching while stuffing your face.",

    "text": "If small is so big, I know want to know what medium or large look like!  This was the first place I came to when I moved to Edinburgh, I had been looking at reviews and was determined to find the vegetarian side of the city. The baked potato shop was very high up the list of recommended places.  It is small inside, there is very little room, but on offer are many options for vegetarians and vegans. They do some fantastic vegan cakes, samosas, soups, and of course, baked potatoes.   I ordered small with haggis and baked beans. It was humongous! This was my first experience of haggis, and though I can't say I'm a fan, I'm glad I got the opportunity to try it. The potato was cooked to perfection and considering the size, it was great value.  This is a really conveniently located little place for tourists, students and businessmen alike, just off the royal mile, near St Giles cathedral, the castle and Waverly station. If you need comfort food (and you will during the Scottish winter, believe me), do try this place out.",

Let me clarify: I LOVE potatoes, and most people/restaurants in the US don't have any appreciation for potatoes (much less understand the concept of jacket potatoes) unless they come as french fries.  But, really, baked potatoes are my favorite thing.  So, naturally, I got a medium potato with some kind of greek salad, cheese and avocado, and it was fantastic. I only wish I could eat here everyday.",

Baked potatoes for around the 3-4 mark are exceptionally good value for money, especially for its location in the city centre.   The staff are friendly and cheerful on the whole.   There are only two slight problems I have ever had with the shop, one is the music can be a bit 'niche' (but I've only ever had takeaway so haven't had to endure it for any length of time) and the other is that, if, like me, you're an omnivore, you're out of luck on the bacon front as they're a vegetarian and vegan outfit. That said the spuds are great with crispy skins and great fillings.   Good, honest, filling, inexpensive.",

And I like the healthy fillings rather then the 10 fillings all swimming for their flavour life in mayonnaise or dry chicken option. All options are vegetarian or vegan and I like my meat but these mixtures are all making that thought not important at all. I can't decide my favourite which is great for both sides as I'll walk any hill and cross any screeching amateur bag piper to get to this cosy potato shop again.    \"I think the pipers would make more money if they rather stopped then playing when given money\"",

When it makes so much sense, so clearly meant to be, that you can't believe it's somehow happening to you for the first time. Where are all the baked potato shoppes of the world, with their steaming jackets of soft, buttery, salt-studded potato filled with the sumptuousness fillings of your choice-- creamy mushrooms?? Egg salad?? Curried tuna??   Gooey melting cheddar and sour cream is what I ended up with, but I could have gone back every day to sample all of their comfort food offerings. Except maybe the vegetarian haggis---I don't need to try that one ; )  The medium potato was SO big and SO filling, I'd like to see Michael Phelps finish one on his own! And yet as my body started to feel like it was morphing into an actual stuffed potato , I couldn't stop forking more of that salty, gooey yumminess into my mouth. The skin! the melted cheese! The love of pure, unadulterated carbohydrates! And for three pounds.   Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes.   Such a simple, sustainable food that has been the poor man's supper for thousands of years still brings so much comfort and pleasure, that  it makes you stop and ponder all those expensive nights out at posh, elitist fusion restaurants.   Long live the potato shop! Please expand to the United States!",

The staff get to chose the music which ranges from Pantara to SClub7! Best thing they are open late, though mind the homeless folk who go in to steal drinks from the fridges, usually late when there's a shift change. Amazing cheap and healthy food folks - yummy!",

During my days at college I would eat a large potato (which normally come with a warning from the staff of \"they're pretty big) on the way home and it would hold my hunger until at least the following morning.  It's a tiny little shop - you can probably only fit a handful of people in the shop at any one time - so in the month of August the queue normally starts out the door but the portion sizes normally increase with it a large potato becomes a meal for two or maybe even three!  I love a classic cheese potato but there are a number of other veggie options. I can only imagine the guac is made fresh every day as it is always on point.  The only downside is there is nowhere to sit an eat. They only have one table with a corner bench that fits around four people. I don't mind sitting next to people I don't know but when you are with a couple of friends you might not be able to eat in the shop - which is never great in a Scottish November.",

    "text": "Erm. It's the Baked Potato Shop. An Edinburgh institution! It does baked potatoes and they are absolutely amaaaazing. They only do veggie and vegan fillings, which means a rainbow assortment of toppings for your tattie, and they do not scrimp on size.  The tatties provided are monster portions, so be aware of this when ordering. I remember I once saw a family of Spanish tourists order four large servings - they could have had one between the family! They were swimming in baked potatoes.   One small baked potato with one filling is all you need to feel full as you like. There is one tiny table to sit in with - the place does well for tourists and folk on the go.   Love, love, love the Baked Potato Shop!",

    "text": "I ventured here after a long walk up to the top of Arthur's Seat and then was heading to the Castle via foot on the hunt for food. A friend who was visiting said he felt like a baked potato, so we ventured to the Baked Potato Shop as I had remembered passing it before and thought it smelled amazing.  Now, it was a gray-sort of slightly-cold day and I in my American-ness was thinking baked potato with broccoli and cheese sounds amazing, but low-and-behold, they don't actually offer many hot toppings for your hot potato. If my memory serves me correctly, it had maybe 5 or 6. The obvious baked beans or chili were options and while both sounded good, they weren't anything too out there.  It was new to me to put chilled sort of salads/mixes on top of a warm potato, but they all looked quite tasty and delicious and extremely fresh so I thought I would try the 'Mexican' topping of kidney beans, corn and peppers atop my potato. I ordered the smallest one and had to say it was a bit pricy for a potato, almost 5 pounds for a small, and in my mind, potatoes are dirt cheap...  Anyways, I am SO glad I opted for the small. Despite my ravenous, long-walk induced appetite, it was entirely too massive. It would have been nice to have one slightly smaller, that was slightly cheaper. Although tasty, it didn't really strike me as a great and absolutely essential food buy for the money I spent on it.  They do have a large array of options and think they have lots of vegan options, all healthy, so that is nice for anyone looking to carb load via vegetarian.   They weren't busy and the service was friendly, but a bit slow. The other friend we were  with just got cheese and most of it wasn't melted, so it was just a giant pile of grated cheese and didn't really meet his expectations. They do put butter on the hot potato if you would like, which is nice, otherwise it might be a bit dry as most of the toppings don't have a sauce...think, veggie salsa or salad on top.  My boyfriend had the chili, which was pretty good, so if I ever go again I think I would opt for the comfort of some chili and cheese on a massive potato. They are also cash only so make sure you've got some on hand. There also is only one small table inside, maybe big enough for 4 max, so it is best to take-away and eat somewhere near by off the Royal Mile. Although, a potato is not really a summer crave when sitting in the park, this is certainly a winter-warm type destination in my mind.",

    "text": "I seem to remember an old advert in which a Lancastrian family was having an argument and their entire vocabulary was the word Potato.  \"POTATO! POTATO-POTATOOO!\"  That's pretty much what my brain shouts whenever I walk into the Baked Potato Shop.  It's definitely what my tummy's thinking. Hefty portions, perfectly cooked, fresh fillings piled on to bursting point... yes, yes, and yes.  (And by \"hefty portions\" I mean that I, self-professed Sultana Of Starch, can barely finish the tuberous exuberance they so whimsically refer to as Small.)  It's only a teeny shop, so if one of the staff is downstairs mixing up some more fillings you might find yourself queueing out in the cold; having only one server instead of two seems to make a disproportionate difference to the speed of the queue. But what a reward awaits the patient. Spud in abundance. Also, if you order the avocado salad from the vegetarian half of the menu (as I unerringly do), there are big lumps of cheese in it that you only notice when you eat it. And what's the best kind of cheese? Yes: SURPRISE cheese!  The other half of the menu is devoted to vegan food, and there are vegan homemade cakes on the counter and vegan box drinks in the fridge. It's great to see vegans so comprehensively catered for instead of being an afterthought on a sub-menu. But even for a dedicated beastie-biter like me, the meat-free delights of The Baked Potato Shop are a must on a trip down Cockburn Street. I'd wager that potatoes elsewhere in the city are just green with envy over these designer jackets.",

They have a great selection of fillings that you didn't know that you wanted until you see, seriously avocado, cheddar cheese, onion and tomato is a genius combination. Although all the fillings are vegetarian there is such a huge range that meat eaters don't really notice and they are super yummy. The portion sizes are huge, I struggle to eat a 'small' potato and a medium would easily feed two people. Also they stock cans of Arizona Ice Tea which I love.   The staff are all super friendly and happy to give suggestions when you are being indecisive. There isn't much seating in the store but get take away and head to the Royal Mile to watch some street performers and you'll be more than happy.",

I was very confused with all the available options and how they count as fillings.. But managed to get what I wanted.. (Mexican filling + cheddar = 2 fillings) cheddar rocks btw.. But next time I think I'll go for the vegetarian haggis..  Also, the prices are very reasonable for the outcome (really full belly)!!

Before coming here I definitely didn't think of Scottish or British food as being synonymous with vegetarian friendly but after visiting this place I definitely had to reevaluate that.  I took a medium potato with sour cream and mushroom. I kind of figured that the mushrooms would be cooked so I was surprised to find that they were raw. While I think I might have preferred them to be cooked, with the sour cream they did go quite well. I also had garlic butter on my potato which was awesome! There are few comforts greater than a garlicky perfectly baked potato.  The place is tiny and only had one table, so we took our potatoes to eat at Princes Street Gardens about a block down.  While there are many reasons to return to Edinburgh, Baked Potato Shop might just be on the top of that list.",

    "text": "I went here during a recent stay in Edinburgh, and I really hope I'll have the opportunity to go back. I realize it's just a baked potato shop, but it was so nice to have such a quick and simple fast food meal. Coming from the US where a fast meal = 1500+ calories of greasy death and digestive upset, it was refreshing to get an actual plant and have numerous vegetarian options for toppings.   The shop was relatively crowded when I went, but the staff was friendly and patient with everyone (while still keeping things moving along nicely). Prices were reasonable, and though there was no seating, it was easy to find a place outside to eat and enjoy the sounds of a random guy with his bagpipe. After my visit here, I find I've gotten a lot more creative with my baked potatoes. I can't wait to get back to Edinburgh next summer.",

In fact, it's probably the only restaurant in the world where I've actually received a satisfactory amount of sour cream! The cheddar cheese and hummus also came in epic proportions!  The menu offers 28 toppings, some pretty innovative, and even my picky son found something he liked. It's not a bad stop for the family.

    "text": "the Baked Potato Shop is located in old town very close to Edinburgh Castle making it a very convenient stop for an expected comfort meal after having visited the castle. this happened to be our order of operations.  though i can't say we were totally disappointed by our visit, we expected more flavor, period. we started out by sharing a haggis samosa which we both decided should not be a thing. the concept of a vegan haggis was intriguing, so we went for it, but the clashing of cultures in the pastry did not work and the haggis was lacking in character. i've never had a traditional haggis, so i'm not sure how to compare it to what we had, but if that's what haggis is supposed to taste like, why bother? my boyfriend and i each got a large potato with three fillings. from what i remember, mine included the spinach salad, hummus, and baked beans. my partner got the vegetable curry, hummus, and spinach salad. the man behind the counter was great at making suggestions, though in retrospect mixing the hot and cold toppings was probably not a wise choice. the temperatures fought each other resulting in a luke warm glop of topping over a steaming hot potato. there were no complaints about the size of the meals, because the potatoes themselves were huge! that having been said, either more of each topping was needed or the salt and/or herb and spice factors should've been amped up. i added quite a bit of salt to mine to make it palatable. the Baked Potato Shop is intended to be a grab and go place, but they offer a small seating area which consists of a somewhat large wooden dining table surrounded by benches resulting in the sharing of food and space by different parties of people. this aspect of the shop i liked. it gave a good opportunity to share space with locals and visitors alike.  a solid positive about the eatery is the wide variety of plant based options on the menu, including potato fillings, snacks, and desserts! the prices were right and the atmosphere was comfortable. if i were judging The Baked Potato Shop purely on the food, i definitely would've knocked it down a star, but the service was good enough, the comfort level of the place was good enough and the menu offerings (lack of taste, outstanding) pumped it up a star. the concept of the eatery is unique, so decide for yourself if it's worth a visit.",

It was mostly just a soggy old potato with about 3 cups of sour cream and 4 cups of cheese on it. Yuk. I couldn't even finish it. My advice is to put a little love into this. Add ingredients that taste good. Put thought into the recipes. It could be sooo good! Bleh. How about some pesto aioli? Or, fresh roasted Mediterranean vegetables? How about a Greek potato with sundried tomatoes, feta, olives and spnach with an italian dressing? How about a Mexican Potato with chipotle sauce, corn, beans etc?",

Located just off the Royal Mile down a tiny little street that will take you to Newtown if you keep walking down.    We selected 2 medium potatoes with 2 toppings each.  Both the husband and I LOVE food and can eat...our medium potatoes were so big we could only finish half each.    Mind you this is a vegetarian baked potato shop so you won't find any meat products.  We are not vegetarians either so don't let that sway you. You can survive one meal sans meat!!  They ask if you'd like butter or garlic butter and then actually work it into the potato.  They don't just drop the toppings on top and let you do the work.  We were pleasantly surprised.  I had the chili and avocado salad.  Both were great.  The chili was perfectly spicy.  The avocado salad was awesome!  It had gigantic hunks of cheese and tomato mixed with some red onion.    They have one small table that would seat 4.  We took our potatoes back to our hotel and enjoyed from our room while watching TV:-). If the weather is nice, grab your tattie and stroll to the park.  The potatoes are so hot even 30 minutes after we got ours.  Would be nice if they offered \"traditional\" broccoli and cheese but hey...who's tradition is that anyway?  I'm giving this place 4 stars simply because they don't offer any real meat chooses.  With that aside, the food is great and the meat wasn't really that big a deal.",

I KNOW I can make a better baked potato at home, but it wasn't just that.. it was the fact that we got two potatoes but when we asked for a separate container to put the other potato, since we were sharing, we were told that it would be the cost of another potato. What? It was also that there was one table in there. Just one. So I guess it's a takeaway place.. but as a tourist, eating a potato outside in the rain is just not appealing. We waited like 20 minutes for a couple to get up after their potato and then sat next to a random girl who stayed while finishing hers. They were out of guac the day we went, could not taste any butter, had to add salt on top, and then there was just potato left with no toppings. Also the girl was very flaky and you had to repeat things a few times for her to understand.. We were all very disappointed and do not recommend and will not return.",

Well, I love potatoes... so initially I was very freaking excited. And oh my... this place did not disappoint.   Right when you walk in, you can feel the heat of the ovens hit your body. The shop itself is very small. Only has one table that sits about five.   Unfortunately, we arrived a little later in the day, so a lot of the toppings we wanted were all out. So all of us settled with a baked potato (you can choose small, medium, or large) with garlic butter (absolute heaven), salt and pepper, and cheese. And oh my. Sounds plain and boring right? No! Not right!   This baked potato (after a minute or two of mixing so my cheese completely melted) is by far one of the best things I have ever eaten. Holy moly. It was freaking delicious. And very fulfilling.   I love how quaint the shop is. And the best part is they cater to vegans and vegetarians. Big plus in my book! They even recycle. Yay!

I've never seen such an extensive potato filling menu, with all the classics and plenty of vegan friendly options. I also never thought I'd get so excited about said potato filling menu but there you go!   We went for the medium size and these were honestly ginormous, I can't even imagine what the large ones are like. I opted for the classic cheese and coleslaw combo with butter and it hit all the right spots.   There's only one small table here which we were lucky to get so you wouldn't be coming here with a large group for lunch but this didn't stop the constant flow of people from coming and getting their food to take away. Clearly a popular spot and I can see why!",

Their hours on the website said closed at 5 or 6, but since is was the festival month of August, we decided to stop by to see if they stayed open late this month.  Our luck, they did!  We stood in a decent line to get our potatoes.   I was bummed that they were out of the avocado one, but switched to just a medium cheddar cheese and garlic butter that I shared with my 8 year old.  That was plenty for both of us.  My two teenagers each got their own small and did the deal for purchasing .  The potato was so creamy, almost like creamed potatoes inside a baked potato.  We all enjoyed it and I highly recommend.  Very conveniently located and cost us about 16 pounds for 4 people, which included 2 small potatoes, 1 medium potato, and 2 drinks.  One of the better priced meals we had in Edinburgh.",

    "text": "We had the beans and cheese potato and the chili potato.  Both were deeply satisfying, filling, and yummy.  Afterewards, I just wanted to take a nap.  I would like to try some of the other toppings there, too, such as the avocado salad and the soured cream.  Service was good, but it was very crowded, and the noise level from the radio made it hard to understand what was being said.  There's no room to eat in there, so we took our food, walked up the street a few yards and put it on one of those black boxes and ate.  There is a circus-like atmosphere during the Fringe Festival--a massive crush of people walking the narrow streets, loud talking and boisterous laughing, pretty girls walking by in soft wool sweaters, people singing the blues, bagpipes playing, a girl with a unicycle, men dressed as women---but none of that existed.  IT WAS JUST ME AND THE POTATO.  I was lost in my own world.  Transported.  I washed it all down with a extra-large IRN-BRU, a Scottish soda pop that tastes like a cross between an orange soda and a cream soda.  For afters we bought a slice of Tiffin cake and a slice of ginger-lemon cake.  The Tiffin is quite good--it has a chocolate topping with coconut   The ginger-lemon cake tasted suspiciously like a banana-date cake, like an old-fashioned tea loaf recipe that grandma used to make, so I think we got the wrong cake, but it was tasty.  We got all of this great food for around 12 pounds--a bargain.  I thoroughly enjoyed this meal, but I can't help but think that a wedding of soured cream and bacon would be the supreme match of flavors with a potato.  Sadly, this isn't likely to happen at a vegetarian establishment.  Give me a meat option and I'll give you 5 stars.  It's only a matter of time before they discover a method of inserting a Snicker's Bar in it and deep frying it.",

For 3.75 that's one of the cheapest lunches I can have in the city without cooking myself. My partner's favourite is the (warm) vegie curry.   The staff is very friendly and efficient - you don't have to wait long even if there is a line. You may choose to eat in but I never do.

    "text": "This review will be small, much like the Baked Potato Shop.  Though small in size, this predominantly take-away restaurant offers a fast and healthy alternative to fish & chips, doner/kebab or deep-fried anything. Not only is a baked potato incredibly nutritious and good for you (don't forget to eat the skin, people!!) the BPS offers a range of scrumptious vegetarian toppings of all sorts to don your tattie. Avocado, red pepper and cheese; cous cous, beans and peppers; curry rice; hummus; pineapple; coleslaw... the list goes on!  With small, medium and large potatoes to choose from, they make a tasty treat for yourself or to share. Though there is very, very limited seating in the place (a small square table with a bench) I've always managed to snag a spot and have actually met some pretty interesting people and had some great conversations over our baked potatoes. A  British/Korean couple from Australia, a homeless lady, and a mother, son and daughter from Spain who I gave bar recommendations to. I suppose it's those experiences which have contributed to my likeness for the Baked Potato Shop.  If the cramped quarters don't suit you, then get your potato for take away and go for a stroll along the Royal Mile, or head down Cockburn St. to Princes St. Gardens, grab a bench, and watch all the gothy-punk teenagers flirt with each other.  The staff are a bit hippy-ish but are friendly and helpful (ask for a sample if you're curious about a certain topping!) and always play obscure music. The BPS also offers veggie/vegan samosas and haggis (be aware those with nut allergies), and a few vegan dessert treats as well. There's a fridge stocked with all sorts of pop and sparkling juice too.   Overall, the Baked Potato Shop offers a tasty and enjoyable potato eating experience!",

The skin is very crispy, and although I don't usually eat the skin I dug right into this one. My cheddar cheese had just about completely melted by now and I sat on a bench scranning it, lovely.  I have to say I didn't think it was that expensive for the popularity of the place coupled with the location. The tatties were about 3-ish depending on what size and what you have. My lunch came to around 4.50 with a juice.   I can only add to the recommendations of others, that you should go and try this place at least once whilst visiting Edinburgh for a hot and tasty lunch!",

I had cheese and spinach, my partner had egg mayo and spinach.  Only problem is the staff are incredibly slow and (when we went any way) have incredibly LOUD music on, which was very annoying when combined with slow service.  Tasty tatos, though.",

It's cheap, you get a lot of food--the potatoes are as big as your head--and it's very filling and satisfying. Ideal cold-weather food.   Baked Potato Shop is also very vegetarian and vegan-friendly, like a lot of places in Scotland. And how else can a vegetarian try haggis? They have a veggie haggis potato topping! Now I want to go back, although I'm good on the veg haggis.",

It's a takeaway (there is one table for four in the front but good luck getting it) so we had to eat our baked potato goodness on the pavement out front, leaning on the shop's windowsill.  It was a bit intimidating/confusing upon entering and when I asked what a cheese and bean was I got a bit of attitude (perhaps deservedly?) and also when I asked what a small was, but the potato made everything okay and I'll go back often.  A small is two small-sized baked potatoes and a medium is three midsized baked potatoes.  We each had the cheese and veggie chili and both of us thought it was amazing, with lots of chunks of veg.  The two orders were less than 8 (no drinks).  This place was heaven on a cold day and made our insides nice and warm.  A great alternative to soup or chili by itself.",

For instance, having decided you fancy curry in your spud there are then about 5 options you could take from there.   Be sure to take your time as you eat at the solitary table as hurrying along ruins the experience. Fellow tatty lovers join you as you dine, imparting their philosophy on what should and shouldn't fill a potato. Gig and exhibition posters dress the room and give an alternative air to proceedings.   The staff are friendly and knowlegeable, often throwing in suggestions on what to try next. The glaringly tasteless tip cup is rarely less than full as a result.",

In one line I can tell you that even months after that we keep raing about this place!! It's totally awesome!  Since it was quite a few months back I forget the exact name of the dishes that we ordered but one was basically a baked potato and the other was a platter. The baked potato is so different and tasty from what we get in the US! We absolutely loved it! The platter was a hit too! They've great preparation and the prices are reasonable!  I miss that baked potato so much that I wish there was a place like that here!",

I can rarely walk by without popping in as the smell is amazing.  I guess the only downside is the fact that there's no seating area, but if it's a nice day there's nothing better than getting a piping hot buttered tater and finding a seat along the Royal Mile to sit down, eat and watch the world go by.",

I've been here a few times and sometimes the skin is a bit tough for my liking, but the potato itself is amazing! they have your standard fillings, mu personal favourite is good ole tuna.

It's vegan.  The first on proves a problem as it means that if I choose to eat here, I probably have to drag myself back to my work to sit and eat it, when one of the main joys of lunchtime is getting out of the place for an hour. On the subject of number two, vegans irritate me, so I'd rather not give them my money.  Despite the lack of freshly slaughtered animals on the premise, the taters do taste great, so it's still worth four stars.",

Between the crowds in the streets and the crowds in the restaurants, even the best laid dining plans can fall apart in a hurry.   Thank God for the Baked Potato Shop.  Conveniently located just off the Royal Mile, the Baked Potato Shop exists to serve starving patrons who have had their fill of experimental theater and street performery and need full stomachs to match. As you might guess from a place called the Baked Potato shop, you shouldn't expect too many fancy culinary surprises here. For that matter, you won't even really find much in the way of seating. What you will find are some unfrigginbelievable baked potatoes with all kinds of delicious toppings, on the cheap and served up quickly.  Truth in advertising never tasted better.",
