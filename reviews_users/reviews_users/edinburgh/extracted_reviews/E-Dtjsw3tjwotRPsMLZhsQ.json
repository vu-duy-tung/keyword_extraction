    "text": "I came for the Steak, I stayed for Desert.   I was craving steak, so we decided to try Wildfire. I had an 8oz Ribeye, with Mash. The Ribeye was...\"OK\". Just OK, really didn't live up to what it was billed as on the Menu (Aberdeen Beef). To be honest, I'd had better Steak at The Keg (Chain in Canada), which made the cost of the entree a bit hard to swallow.   However, the Desert's were sublime. We decided to take the shot-gun approach and order the Honey/Oatmeal/Whisky Ice-Cream with berries, and Chocolate Torte with salty Caramel Sauce...oh, and a single Malt from Skye. It was sublime! I waddled out of there with a very happy stomach.  Great selection of Single-Malt's for desert too!   Total was in/around 80 (pounds) for two entrees, two glasses of wine, two deserts and a single-malt. Bit overpriced, but the desert(s) really overshadowed the disappointing Steak.",

    "text": "After a long day walking from the old town to Leith, along the waterfront, and back, I was starving -- my smartphone at the ready, I was convinced that the one thing I was craving was Scottish steak.  I didn't have a reservation, but the do-everything host and server was able to squeeze me into a gap.  It was warm and cozy within, a welcome relief from the chilly night riding on the back of a cold, grey day.  Their salmon special for the night looked delicious, as did several other items, but freshly seared moocow was on my mind, and I ordered the very reasonable steak, rare and bloody.  Now, I am a stickler for meat being cooked to the order specs.  I rarely send anything back, but I have been known to gripe, bitch, and moan when the done-ness isn't quite right.  No worries here, though: my rare steak was cooked to absolute perfection.  Pink but not cold, plenty of give, buttery in flavor even without the garlic butter I drizzled atop it, and perfect with the glass of red I needed on the side.  It does cost a bit, but compared to other steak specialists, the prices here are very reasonable, and the service is quite nice.  The wine list is decent, and the atmosphere is intimate without being stuffy.  From one carnivore to the rest, you ought to go here.",

The steaks were cooked exactly how we asked and the sides were a great addition. There beer selection  was small, but they were quality beers. The Dark Island was fantastic! I hope to go back next time I am craving a steak! The food and service were great!",

The service was spotty in places, but was generally right on, and our water glasses remained full!  The steaks here are really, really nice--Aberdeen cuts cooked just the right amount, served with watch-it-melt butter.  The fries on the side were generously portioned, the salad small but delicious.  Small but very nice wine selection.  Tasty but pricey desserts and dessert drinks.  It's a cosy (read: small) restaurant, with a handful of tables inside, and a handful of tables out.  Make a reservation; we saw many eager customers turned away for lack of tables.",

As a regular, I can vouch for the excellent service, seasonal menus and I recommend Wildfire to everyone I know! My favourite is well-done steak and it is often difficult to get a steak cooked that retains the flavour and moisture. At Wildfire you get exactly cooked steak, to your liking and the most flavoursome moist texture that seldom needs a sharp knife. As the daughter, granddaughter and great grandaughter of Master Butchers, I know the difference and have a very high expectation. Wildfire never disappoints. Well worth booking due to the popularity. Lunches can be two or three course for people in a hurry, but once you try the starter you'll just want more and more. Everything freshly prepared and such a wonderful choice, you too will return again and again!",

We chose the Wildfire as we're keen seafood and steak lovers and the reviews were very good. We chose the smoked haddock chowder and salmon salad for starters. Both were divine, the chowder had a lovely creamy texture and the fish was mildly smoked. For mains we had surf and turf Ribeye (medium rare) with blue cheese sauce and the baked salmon. The steak was cooked perfectly and with a little bit of fat if that's how you like it. The salmon was juicy with the skin quite crispy and well seasoned. We topped it off with sticky toffee  pudding & ice cream and the whisky ice-cream- absolutely delish! Highly recommend.",

    "text": "I usually try to avoid using superlatives, but this was the best steak I have ever had, full stop. Maybe it's because I'm American or just because I looooooove me some red meat, but I am very good at eating steak. I do it a lot. And saying this was the best wasn't up for debate in my mind.   Friday evening, just got into town, having a drink with a friend and we are both craving steak. Of course I search steak in my handy dandy yelp app and Wildfire shows up. My friend tells me we would be lucky to get a table there as it's small and insanely good. She even booked it for her uni graduation a couple of years ago. I called, they had one spot open but we had to get there in 10 minutes. She wasn't kidding, it is small. They must do only 2 covers each night. We went straight for the steak mains.   I wish I had taken a picture, but I dove right in. By the end I was scared to finish because then it would be over. And I loved that medium rare ribeye so much I would have cuddled it. It comes with a bit of garlic butter, I got their special blue cheese and something or other sauce as well, and a side of garlic mushrooms. I'm salivating writing this right now. The worst part about the meal was the end because I was so forlorn that I couldn't keep eating the delectable bits of steak, the shoestring french fries, the sauce! Oh lord the sauce. The entire meal was a religious experience.   How did I spend a year in Edinburgh and not go here until I come back for a short visit?!  Go. You won't regret it. Unless you're a vegetarian. Then it might be awkward.",

I can still remember the wonderful steak and the skinny fries we were served.  It is a small place, but it will sit about 20-25 diners to capacity, it could feel a little cramped when seated in the middle.   I remember that the prices were a little high, that said, I remember eating more expensive restaurants with less tasty offerings.  Although we did had an anniversary dinner here it is not a romantic or quiet restaurant. A place near the window corner will allow you to feel a bit more private.

The only down side I must tell about is that I was sat in the middle of the room which has of course frequently brushed by the staff, that wasn't the issue however I had half of my chair on a trap door and when anyone stepped onto the door as they walked by my chair moved and this really stressed me out for the first hour, until I got a few beers in and a great steak to focus on! Although annoying it doesn't warrant losing a star in my review. Thank you for the great meal!",

But for a very central restaurant, the portions were generous, the food was tasty, and the bill wasn't that bad at all. Wildfire is a small Scottish restaurant just off Princes Street that specialises in meat (think Aberdeen Angus Steak) and seafood. I had the special of the day, which was a pan fried cod with vegetables in a cream sauce, which was just amazing. Dessert was good too  my whisky and honey ice cream was some of the best desserts I've ever had. Definitely will be going back to Wildfire again on my next trip to Edinburgh.

    "text": "If you are looking for a restaurant serving traditional Scottish food, Wildfire is the place to go. Situated in Rose Street, Wildfire is right in the centre of the city and it is just around the corner from the main shopping street in Edinburgh, Princes Street, and so it is a convenient place to reach.   There is a very homely feel inside with the restaurant, with stone walls, wooden floor and a wooden burner, making it look modern and giving it a relaxed atmosphere. Wildfire's menu offer traditional Scottish dishes such as Aberdeen Angus steaks, mussels and a vast range of seafood dishes. I came here one evening with my parents for dinner and we had a lovely meal. I had the seafood chowder to start, which was absolutely amazing - it wasn't too salty which it can sometimes be, it was perfect. I then had the salmon fillet marinated in cajun spices which full of flavour and tasted really fresh - yum! My dad had the steak which he said was one of the best steaks he had ever tasted, and that is saying something!   The prices are on the whole pretty reasonable, with most starters around 6, and main courses about 15 and the steaks priced at about 20. Set lunches are available, which cost 10 for two course which is excellent value. Wildfire is a great restaurant to go to for a real taste of Scottish food.",

Not normally a fan of the fat but even this was cooked well, and melted in the mouth.  Girlfriend had the chicken and I was lucky enough to try a bit before she polished it off. It was amazing. Succulent, juicy and tasted as if the chicken had spent a lifetime bathing in flavour before willfully transferring itself onto the plate. She doesn't nornally finish her meals but this time round the plate was clean, that just about sums up how good this place was. Nice service too.",

The atmosphere was cozy and classy and the service was non-invasive but very accommodating. We tried a few things for the first time and can't wait to return one day for another go at them. The haggis was delish! It was light, not fried, and served with a lovely drambouie sauce and a shortbread cracker. It melted in our mouths and even my 7 yr old son loved it and also will  forever remember their grilled prawns! We also tried the Cullen Skink and - oh my gosh - it was sooo good!! Lastly - the homemade hot butterscotch sauce to pour over the ice cream my son had was so decadent. Thank you so much Wildfire - well done!! We can't wait to return!!",

I didn't have a reservation, but managed to snag a seat. The waiter said that they usually keep a table for walk ins and it's based on a first come, first serve basis. I was lucky enough to be first, and watched as numerous walk ins after me got turned away.  The servers were very friendly and helpful. They didn't make me feel rushed, which is always a bonus. I ended up getting the mussels to start and the ribeye steak as my main. Both were absolutely phenomenal. I dream about them still. The mussels were in this delicious garlic and white wine sauces. Perfectly cooked and so, so, so flavourful. The exact same thing could be said about my ribeye, which was incredibly tender, melting in my mouth. It was just as good the next day as leftovers. Definitely one of the best steaks I've ever had in my life.  Absolutely wonderful place to stop in for a meal. After such good food it was impossible to feel anything but pleased with the world.",

If you trying haggis for the first time, then you chose a great place for it as their haggis appy is delicious.  Goat cheese tart with caramelized onions layered throughout is one of the best I've had.  Fricassee was equally as good.  Entrees were salmon, Aberdeen Angus ribeye, and seafood pie. Salmon was seared skin on atop a bed of green beans and snap peas.  Perfectly cooked.  Ribeye was full of flavor and also perfectly cooked.  Seafood pie was a their rendition of shepherds pie, really prepared well.  Service is great.  A great find in Edinburgh!",

They are friendly to gluten free and other dietary needs.  The standouts are their pies, which seems to be what they are known for.  Service is good and the prices seem to be reasonable compared to similar places found in more touristy areas.",

    "text": "This is a great example of when Yelp is useless, nee a public nuisance. I'm in a city for the first time and looking for a place to eat. I have the concierges recommendations but I want to life dangerously. I search yelp for recommendations. Wildfire pops to the top with gushing quotes like , \"maybe it's because im an American but the best steak of my life\" etc. I assume that since I'm in Edinburgh, the second best steak of his life wasn't at Outback, and the steak may be good.  Well I was wrong. His second best steak must have been at Ponderosa. A pleasant enough atmosphere, but seriously the steak must have come from an ancient oxen that had used to plow fields for the prior decade..  Not good. Go with a legit review source not this bogus Yelp. Sometimes web 2.0 is an improvement to the status quo, e.g Wikipedia, sometimes things like restaurant reviews should be left to the experts.",
