    "text": "Was heading to Sainsbury's Local for something cheap and instant for dinner but stopped in here instead. Wasn't really hoping for much but was surprised by the service. I was obviously a foreigner but treated me like a regular, I only say this because two regular customers came in before and after me, and it was the same easy-going familiar greeting. Like, 'no worries, I'll take care of ya' type of tone. And I didn't have to struggle to get attention. Didn't rush me for my order as I asked questions about different items. Even took the time to answer each one with care so that I understood even the size/shape the meat came in.  SPACE// Nothing fancy. A couple chairs for seating, but not enough to accommodate groups. What you'd imagine a takeaway-only place to look like.   FOOD// Food portion was good. Most items are pretty cheap. I had the chicken kebab, thought it was good. Watched him make everything to order. I noticed price on take-out menus and menu board didn't match though. So if you grab a menu to take home, keep that in mind.",

    "text": "Spicy bite still does great pakora (still made on site) and decent kebabs, pizzas and burgers, however I have now had a chance to try the curries and they are good... The food is great value (7.20 for a curry and rice, 2.50 for veg pakora) and it is tasty and filling so at the end of the day Spicy Bite is a small unassuming takeaway which delivers decent food at a good price.  It doesn't look like much on the outside but Spicy Bite is a good choice for pre/post cinema food (I would go with pre given the quality and price of cinema food) and it serves the kebab house staples until late.",

    "text": "If you want luxury, you will not find it here, if you want a filling meal at a bargain price, you will find it in abundance. Situated close to Cineworld, it is ideal for a pre or post film munch. There is seating inside, although quite limited and most people opt to take their food out. I generally go for the pizza, which is admittedly quite greasy, but at 3.20 for 10 inches of Margherita pizza, you can hardly go wrong. My friend usually goes for a burger and chips and you are able to customise your burger with a choice of sauces and salads. There are also burgers and chips, curries and kebabs on offer, all very modestly priced too. Further, the staff seem very bubbly and happy to have a chat with you while your food is being prepared too.",

    "text": "It is a takeaway shop although you can have a bite inside it too. It offers a wide range of pizzas, burgers, and kebabs. The prices are ridiculously cheao, you can get a big portion of chips for only 1.20 and all burgers' prices, including a fresh fish one, range between 2.50 to 3.60. You can choose your own salad and sauces, according to your taste. The shop is just opposite Cineworld complex and is a much better dining place to any of the restaurants and cafes in the complex.",
