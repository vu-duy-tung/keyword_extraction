Inside this whiffy shop, you'll find cheese. Lots, and lots of cheese. I think Scottish cheeses are very underrated, and I absolutely adore Clava Brie having tasted it at a very swank dinner party at Christmas, so I was over the moon to find it here. As well as cheese you can also buy fine foods like meats and preserves, which are all of the highest quality, which is reflected in the price.",

I could not finish the whole plate, which was a crying shame, but I was running a food marathon that day and had to pace myself.

We ended up buying:  - Isle of Mull cheddar: nice and sharp  - Hebridean blue: a bit creamy and nutty - Dinarski extra mature: I've never had cheese from Croatia before  - Reypenaer Gouda VSOP (2 year): with salt crystals and all - this is my usual go to cheese   Others we tried:  - Old lochnagar: a deep orange, reminded me a bit of cheese for American mac n cheese  - Auld reekie: smoked; good, but the smokiness was overpowering  - Anster: from Fife; fruity  They also have many of the usual accompaniments, including a good amount of charcuterie, crackers, etc.   Customer service here was wonderful - she even packed some plastic knives for us since we were heading on the road.  I like that the receipt actually listed everything we got since most other places don't label the cheeses nor tell you what you got.   Definitely check this out for some unique Scottish and European cheeses at good prices.",

Although they were out of it on my visit today, they also stock a Hebridean naturally peat-smoked sea salt that has been a great addition to several dishes I've prepared.   The tiny store can get a bit packed during peak times and the service might seem a little slow to some, but the staff there really does seem to want to be thorough when answering questions and helping customers.   Whether the shop has been packed or I've been the only customer, I've received good service and of course love the selection of cheeses and other treats.",

And no, I'm not over-exaggerating!  I've never seen so many cheeses crammed into one tiny shop. There's a huge section of blue cheeses (but they're kept separately from all the others in case all you people who are allergic to penicillin were wondering), a huge section of local cheeses as well as another section of more exotic ones.  They are definitely pricey. Prices range from 20-30 per kilo, so it's definitely not the sort of place you go to get your cheese on toast ingredients, but for a special occasion (or if you're just loaded) it's perfect. But the friendly service eases the pain on your purse - not only did the woman that served me know exactly what she was on about (I didn't know there were so many flavours you could get out of one tiny bite of cheese?!) but she also let me try a nibble of as many as I wanted.

It's easy to see why; there are countless varieties of excellent, quality farmhouse cheeses to choose from and something to suit all tastes, whether you're looking for something mild and creamy or strong and smelly. The staff are incredibly helpful and will let you sample before you buy, I could easily spend all day in here sampling everything! Given the high quality of the produce, the prices are also quite high, but the old cliche 'you get what you pay for' is very much applicable.

Now that I have grown up a bit and really appreciate fine produce, I have grown to love the aroma that wafts up from this shop on Victoria Street.  I J Mellis specialise in cheeses from Scotland, England and Ireland, and are great at showcasing the cheese that is produced practically  on our doorstep (not literally, of course - that would be weird!)  So even though I have never experienced someone stirring dairy produce outside my house in the morning, I have tasted some gorgeous cheese made in Arran, up north and in Ireland. The Ireland cheese in particular is scrumptious - it's billed as being salty, but I find it gives it flavour. They also sell Scottish outcakes, delicious milk and some deli appetisers.  It's pricier than going to the supermarket, but then you would expect that from a place with such quality foods. People certainly don't seem to mind paying extra either, since these cheeses are treats. Great for cooking but also for special occasions - some of the flavours in here would make for a very colourful cheese board indeed! I'd recommend trying the blue cheeses - I was a bit shy of them before I tried I J Mellis since they are typically potent, but some of the Scottish blues sold here give you a good introduction.  You could almost say I J Mellis reeks of quality, but to suggest that would be cheesy(!)",
