    "text": "This is, unfortunately, our designated branch for deliveries.   I really enjoy Pizza Hut, but when ordering from this branch it's a bit hit and miss as to the quality of the pizza.   Sometimes the pizzas are lovely, but I've had many a soggy base overloaded with sauce. I've also had lots of instances of being brought the wrong order and having to wait another 30 minutes or more for our order.   The staff seem to be a bit clueless when you call and not very apologetic when a problem arises.   I do still use this branch occasionally, but I do so with the knowledge that it's a 50/50 chance whether we'll enjoy the food!",

    "text": "This Pizza Hut is awful. I ordered at 520 for a pizza to be delivered at 8. We waited till 830 then called, and were told that it would come at 9. Then at 9 we were told it would be another 20 minutes. So we waited an extra hour and twenty minutes for a pizza we ordered two and a half hours early. The lady on the phone was NOT helpful and did not care that we had been waiting. I would give this zero but I can't. I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM PIZZA HUT AGAIN.",

    "text": "Probably the worst pizza I've had delivered to my house. Ever. I ordered a 16.99 pizza but thankfully had a voucher so it only cost 9.99 - Thank God as it wasn't even worth that.  The base was uncooked and the amount of toppings was laughable. I've seen more topping on a bog standard supermarket pizza. I also asked for three dips, a simple request which they also managed to get wrong.  I had to fire up my oven and cook it properly which kind of defeated the whole purpose of a take away.     Not good enough.",

    "text": "Pizza hut offers a huge challenge - all you can eat for 7.99. Your buffet can include the salad bar as well, which offers refreshing fat-free intervals as you prepare your stomach for more onslaught. Or you could just go for a nice pizza and coke! The staff are always friendly, and appreciate you are trying to eat your money's worth! Overall good value for money.",
