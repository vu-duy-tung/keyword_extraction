There wasn't much on offer to eat but the staff were lovely and can't complain when they are providing a service a day after Christmas! At least I got a cuppa!",

    "text": "Ah, Starbucks. How the mighty have fallen. Once the bright blazing new star that tried to convert us tea-drinking Brits into caffeine-fuelled maniacs, now you are  nothing more than a tawdry tarnished tinsel-clad fairy lying forlorn and forgotten at the bottom of the tree.   At half past four in the afternoon on Lothian Road and desperate for some coffee, the options are a bit limited around here, so Starbucks with their prime corner position seemed the safest choice. How wrong I was.   The place was in need of a good clean, there was only one person doing everything;  they'd run out of clean mugs for those sitting in so I had to make do with a paper cup instead, and when it finally arrived I ended up leaving half of it as it was so pathetically watery.   Please would somebody open a Caffe Nero or a decent independent coffee emporium here? Pretty please?",

It's a very convenient location for stopping on the way into town and it's quite good for people watching if you can get a window seat. The wifi worked fine so you'd be able to work from here easily.",

    "text": "Arrived here this morning for a filter coffee.   There was a bunch of people waiting for coffees and one barista on the machine. That didn't deter me as filter coffees in Starbucks don't come from the fancy machine. So I ordered from one of the two girls still taking orders. She took my name and I repeated I wanted a filter coffee.   Then I waited and waited. I was feeling pretty annoyed when my bus switched to due and I still didn't have my coffee - and no time left to do anything about it (my own passiveness makes this three instead of two stars)  I left to run for my bus. I am coffee-less.   I was not informed when I arrived that there would be a wait, my coffee does not require a wait, why did I have to wait?! Not only that but why were two people taking orders when only one coffee machine is working? That just compounds the problem.   *Tuesday morning feeling-entitled rant over*",

    "text": "Having switched up my early morning off-to-work hustle, I spend a wee minute on Lothian Road most days trying not to melt into a puddle of sleepy sadness while waiting for my bus. Spending all your time bleary-eyed on the same stretch of road every morning means you get quite familiar with the coffee shops nearby.  This Starbucks along Lothian/Bread Street is fine. I've been at least two or three times now, and haven't had a bad experience yet, nor any particularly exciting experiences. The service is fine and prompt, and the baristas seem very mildly, perfunctorily friendly. I've at least witnessed a few of them smiling and chatting with each other whilst going about their business, so perhaps they just may be human after all, not just caffeine-dispensing early morning machines.  Perhaps it's the foyer of the place that doesn't give it a very relaxing feel--most of the seating is further back into the building. If you're coming in to get something for takeaway you may find yourself shuffling about amongst others in the narrow bit between the counter and some tall bar-style seating nearest the windows.  I think, all in all, it's missing a little of the charm and personality other Starbucks--and dare I say it, Costas--achieve depending on their location (Forrest Road branch still has my heart with their friendliness and free cookies). But if you're looking for a normal ol' cup of joe, you can't really go wrong here.",

Either the beans were old or the coffee was burnt.   It was also over filled when served to me, in my mind common sense would dictate you'd just pour a bit out before giving a drink to someone knowing full well they're about to go walking around town with it.   Unimpressed. I'm sure you'd find better coffee sonewhere else, ANYWHERE else in Old Town.",

And no one serves coffee with cream or half and half. I don't like just milk in my coffee.  So, I hit this Starbucks and they gave me a huge piping hot cup of coffee and when I asked for cream, they said, SURE. And then they said if I bring my empty cup back, I get a free refill. Great morning. However, the almond croissant was a day old. Other than that, happy day.",

    "text": "I like this particular Starbucks because it seems the ideal place for hanging out for hours and writing, or talking with friends over coffee.   When you come in, the shop seems very small, but there are actually two further rooms toward the back, both with several table and comfortable chairs. The room at the very back is my favourite. It's furnished with comfy sofas and tables at just the right height to rest one's laptop on and type away while drinking coffee.   The art on the walls is from locals, and I think some of it's for sale - I'm sure I saw price tags on some of the paintings last time I was there. So if you take a fancy to it, you might be able to go home with it!   This Starbucks is one I'd pick for meeting up with a good friend on a rainy day and spending several hours chatting about nonsense and drinking several coffees in a row, with a biscotti or some cake. It's also the one I'd pick if I wanted to take my laptop out of the house and go write somewhere comfortable and cosy just for the fun of it.",

    "text": "I disagree with the previous review. This is a nice little Starbucks, much more intimate than many of the larger ones in Edinburgh, and a very comfortable atmosphere. Sure, the prices are quite high, but that's to be expected from a premium coffee chain such as Starbuck's. The coffees are perfectly reasonable, and at 1.60 for a freshly-brewed coffee, including a free refill, can even be a bargain! Lunchtimes are often very busy, however, and the lines can extend out of the small shop at times, so try to make it down after peak hours if you want to snag yourself a quiet little corner. And, like all good coffeeshops, this is a great spot to people-watch.",
