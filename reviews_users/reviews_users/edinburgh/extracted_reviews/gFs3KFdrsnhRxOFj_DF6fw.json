The lower level accommodates the bar, and offers mostly 'standing' space, however there are plenty of tables and seats within the upper level.   The bar offers a very good selection of drinks, and while I've not eaten in here myself, the food menu appeared to include a good selection of both snack and full meal options. Less options were available for the vegetarian howeverif I remember correctly, there were snack and light bite options available, but absolutely no vegetarian main courses, which was slightly disappointing.   A nice bar though. A place that I would visit again!",

It sometimes feels a little out of place down in Leith as it's one of the more upmarket options and very much fits the wine bar mould of bright lights and chrome fittings. It's quite pricey, even by Shore standards and has a more impersonal feel that most of the surrounding bars but if you enjoy dance music and being seen then this might be the very place for you. Occasional drinks promotions, slow service on lunchtime food and slightly cool atmosphere, not in the good way.",

It's much more of a bar than a pub which sets it apart from most of the places along the Shore. However, like many G1 bars in the West, the Granary is let down by its food. The restaurant section in the back is dark and feels cold rather than, compared to the airy bar area in front. The service is very slow and forgetful (I've waited 25 minutes on one occasion before being told the chef had forgotten our order so we would have to wait another 20). The food is average at best with little menu choice. I recommend coming here for drinks but going to one of the other great pubs and restaurants in Leith for food as you will be disappointed here.",

For starters we had the patatas bravas ( overcooked / burnt but I sent them back and it was quickly rectified) and a scotch egg. The scotch egg was great and I'd recommend this. The patatas bravas had chorizo. I probably wouldn't have again as wasn't anything to rave about.  For mains I had fish and chips which were ok but unmemorable. The chips were unevenly cooked and I get the feeling were two different batches as some were undercooked and others overcooked. I wish they were handcut rather than frozen. I also got a side of rainbow slaw. It tasting of nothing but was ok once I added salt and pepper. Not worth ordering.  My other half had a burger with pastrami on a pretzel bun and this was much nicer and I wish I had ordered this as I had a bite to try and it was tasty. Again her chips were subpar. I had a pint of beer and she had two coronas and the total for all this including tip was 50 which is pretty reasonable for the location just a shame the food is so close to being good but just falling short of what it could easily be with a bit more refinement. Service was excellent though.",

The interior is build like a farmer's stead and stone flooring and dark wooden balustrades on the top floor complete that look. It does make a a bit dark when there is no sun to shine through to floor to ceiling glass front.   Either in Winter or Summer it has a sun during the day time (when it is out) and the best seat in the house is at the back near the window panel and the fireplace.   The service is mostly courteous and friendly. Not too efficient, but it does add to the chill out factor of this place.  I want to like it and I have visited on many occasions, however if my favourite spot is taken it is not very pleasant. There are too many dark spots in this bar restaurant and that creates a chill factor. The second part I dislike is prices. they are ever so slightly more expensive than other bars.   The food doesn't come up to a standard that warrants a 'I have to come back' comment - it is fine, being it a tad on the bland side.   No doubt I will be visiting more as the summer is approaching, but I doubt if my rating is getting any better.",

I went in with a party of 8 (4 adults, 4 kids) and only one of us enjoyed his food (he had the steak & ale pie).   Our poor server was the only one in the restaurant, so we rarely saw him, but to his credit he was quite nice and did everything he could. The kids got cheeseburgers and mac-n-cheese.  The burgers were dense and stiff.  The mac-n-cheese was mealy and underseasoned - from scratch! but the roux didn't make for a smooth sauce.  The kids made some good faith efforts to eat their dinners, but after tasting their food the parents didn't ask them to eat more.  They feasted on chips. The mussels.  Ugh.  Worst I've ever had.  Ever.   I was hungry! and I didn't finish.   Three of us had them and all agreed - awful.  The mussels were old and had a grainy mouth-feel.  There were a lot of cracked shells, as well as unopened ones.  The white wine broth had a funky waft and tasted underseasoned (again). Everything was an overall disappointment here.",

Good selection of drinks (lagers, beers, wheat beers, wines, gins, cocktails, etc.) is available but rather overpriced. During evenings the place can get busy (nice atmosphere, though) but the bar staff is not renowned for their speed, so if you are queuing for a pint and the bar tender is making a cocktail, well...you are kind of doomed...

I've only been here a handful of times and haven't been overly impressed by what was on offer, but last night i was mainly there to partake in the pub quiz fun.  On arrival and after some directions from my friend, i managed to find my way upstairs to the loft bar which is above the mezzaine bar via a slightly hidden staircase near the toilets.  The loft bar itself is rather chic, with dark colors and all modern interior.  This is starkly different than the ground flood which has a fireplace, arm chairs, and a more cosy pub feel.  It was nice, but a bit generic at the same time.  We ordered some nibbles to have during the pub quiz and i can report that they do nice chips, but found the onion rings a bit greasy.  my friends assured me that the sticky toffee pudding was quite nice though.  drinks were drinks, and since i was only drinking diet coke it would be pretty hard to mess that up.    the pub quiz was a good laugh although our team only won the prize for best team name!  still quite chuffed with my Real Radio mug though.  However, The Granary made little impression on me to make the effort to go back to try any of their main meals.  It was a bar that served the function of holding a pub quiz in comfortable surroundings.  I can't say much more than that unfortunately.",

The prices aren't cheap so i would expect better.  I was back down at the Shore again at the weekend so decided to give it another try. A decision i regretted. I ordered the soup and sandwich of the day, parsnip and carrot soup and bacon, brie and cranberry sandwich, for 5.99, not too bad. The soup was extremely bland, not a good start. The sandwich also wasn't great, the brie seemed more like feta which was a bit odd.  So basically i have tried with this place but never been impressed.

I work down at the Shore and wanted to like this place because it is so handy, but it just does not floating my boat! ;) I've eaten here 3 times (I gave them a few chances, hoping it would get better) but the quality of food was either cold/luke warm, cheap or poor quality.  The menu is uninspiring and standard pub grub, nothing to get excited about.  It's a shame, because if they improved the menu and standards, this place could be really buzzin'!  They have a small gig/function space upstairs (they even hold poll dancing classes up there), a mezzanine level for diners and cosy armchairs at the front. In the summer they open the full height windows onto the street, prefect for a sitting in the sun with an ice cool pint.  They often host live acoustic sets next to the fire place from Wednesdays-Fridays too.  So they are getting there!   I last visited in November 2013, but in recent news, on the 21st December 2013 just before Christmas, a blaze ripped through their kitchen forcing customers and staff to be evacuated.  Luckily there were no casualties, but the fire spread to the roof and it took around 30 fire-fighters extinguish the blaze!  The kitchen is currently getting repaired and we are yet to hear when they will be re-opening for food, I do hope they improve the food quality at the same time!",

    "text": "The Granary is one of the much spoken about Glasgow group G1's first forages into the Edinburgh market and has many of the traits you would expect from their Glasgow west end establishments..... well put together, great decor, ambiance, superb staff...so why such a low score!  Well usually I go to old faithful Kings Warf for my brunch but with Mum she prefered the look of the Granary so we went there. I was very tempted to get my favoured eggs beneduct but with my hangover going in to over drive the only sensible thing to eat seemed to be a fry up!!  Grilled bacon, sauage, mushroom, grilled tomoato, egg as you want it, haggis, black pudding, tattie scone and toast - the words had me salivating!!!  Now I have said many times on here that the key to any meal is good produce and I think the great Scottish breaky is a perfect example of why - all the ingredients laid bare with only their taste and a bit of ketchup to help them up!!  That was issue - cheap plastic pork sausages (you know the kind), ultra thin black pudding with zero flavour, chewy partially burned bacon, gloopy haggis, oil filled tattie scone......! In a word........yuck!!  This place could be and should be the brunch place of Leith. great coffee, teas all served by great staff....but if you are going to cut back on food qaulity YOU WILL LOSE!!!!!  Wont be back to eat any time soon or untill i hear the words....new management/chef!!  Jd = not impressed!",

    "text": "Not impressed. The reviews weren't too great so v hesitant to try it but I gave it a go. I ordered their soup of the day and found the soup to be bland and found a piece of tooth pick in it to top it off! I decided not to give my main a go so canceled that. The drinks maybe go but didn't come in for that. Wouldn't recommend it for food.",
