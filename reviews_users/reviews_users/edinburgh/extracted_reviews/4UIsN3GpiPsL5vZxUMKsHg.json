Your server is also the cook and all the baked goods seemed to be made in house. Coffee was amazing and the full breakfast had everything to sample for a Scottish breakfast. Black Pudding was very good as was everything else on the plate.  A nice find to be able plenty of items to sample for someone looking for something True to the city and not cookie cutter.",

Her eggs, scones & other baked goods, mixed salads, coffees - all amazing - eggs and creams are just better in this country than in the states from which we hail. I had cappucino, eggs and toast - simple stuff really but amazing by her hand. A special place, friendly and comfortable - highly recommend it.",

    "text": "There are so many restaurants to choose in Edinburgh that the process of choosing can be a little overwhelming sometimes; I'm glad that the last time I ate out, I chose Laura's Kitchen.  There's isn't a lot of seating here, but if you can't get seated they also do take-out.  You'll find a lot of good choices on the menu here.  Some of the dishes you'd expect to see in a place like this, others you wouldn't.    Tip: Be sure to check the Specials Board :-)  I often like to request a sandwich or a toastie made from ingredients displayed in the counter.  They also serve house-made cakes and soup.  Everything tastes and looks fresh; this is a great place to stop for tea and/or a snack :-)  The staff is patient, friendly, and attentive.  I particularly recommend this place if you're interested in an inexpensive, homey place to escape the hustle and bustle of High Street!",

The porridge has the perfect consistency and the toppings fresh. The waitress was even willing to add apple as a topping even though it wasn't listed as an option. Very few restaurants around here are able or willing to fulfill at the customers request, so it was a pleasant surprise! The service is prompt and the waitress pleasant. A friendly and clean atmosphere, though small, you can feel comfortable here. Decent Americano as well. I would absolutely recommend this place!",

A sweet little place with a few small table rounds and a longer bar against the wall, it was more than enough for a sit down.  I ordered the full Scottish breakfast and husband ordered a ham croissant and hot chocolate. My full breakfast came out with all the trimmings overflowing the plate: fried egg, beans, pancake, hash brown, mushrooms, bacon, sausage, haggis, corned beef, black pudding, toast and coffee! Talk about FULL. :) Everything was great - even the black pudding, which I ate until I made the mistake of asking what was in it. :P Rookie tourist.  Husband's hot chocolate was beautiful and brimming with whipped cream and white and pink marshmallows.  Laura (I assumed that was her name?) was lovely and friendly. The prices were much more reasonable than any recommendations from our hotel and I'd definitely lead people here for a proper authentic meal!",
