Make a reservation or come earlier or later without. It's popular locally. The most delicious of Puglia recipes served efficiently and beautifully.",

Really had no idea if it was even possible to get this all done so quickly but the wait staff and chefs were amazing! All of our food came with much time to spare and the drinks were great also. Glad to have had such a great experience here. Bruschetta was delicious",

Daily local seafood catches are also featured. Though beer is limited to standard Italian labels, the wines are more than adequate and available by the glass, half carafe or bottle.",

My family (4 adults 2 kids) each had a starter, entry, dessert and a bottle of wine and drinks for the kids and our bill was under 75. The portions were of good size and everything was delicious. The service was amazing and the restaurant (and bathroom) was very clean.   Highly recommend!",

    "text": "What a delight. We were in Edinburgh in August, 2017, looking for an Indian restaurant when we decided to look at the castle from below and walked past Il\"Castello. The scents coming through the open door were amazing, so we looked at the menu and decided to forget Indian and have Italian. The minute we walked in, it was like being in Italy. The staff, the smells, the dishes just took me back to an Italian vacation years ago. Nothing was Scottish. Everything whispered Italy! Our dinner and house wine was excellent, even though we are always on a budget so we ordered one of the least expensive dishes. My only regret is that I didn't splurge and have the house special that night of mussels--and maybe order a pasta to go with it. If I'm ever in Edinburgh again, I will go there and this time splurge. Heck, it's less expensive than a trip to Italy.",

The food wasn't good enough. We ordered calamari as starter and the oil for this fried maybe was too old. The main dish was disappointed for all of us. The portions small, the pasta typical of discount supermarket. For 14 pounds you can get an small piece of lamb with chips. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",

My starter wasn't particularly great, but the main course of lamb cutlets was really good. It's very reasonably priced and the staff are friendly, welcoming and knowledgeable.  Overall, we said: \"I rather enjoyed Il Castello. Their take on melanzane wasn't for me, but that aside it strikes me as a very reliable, friendly little place. And what's more, their espresso was so good that I had a second one. Next time you're in the environs, pop in for a warm welcome and good Italian fare.\"",

    "text": "Taking its name from the most famous of land marks whose shadow it sits in, Il Castello is a dissapointment from the moment you walk in.  Despite being recently redecorated, the outside still seems shabby, and already the place is starting to look as though it could do with a lick of paint on the inside. As we arrived we were greeted by a surly waiter who communicated soley in grunts, and then promptly forgot about us. It took almost 20 mins to get a seat in a deserted restaurant.  The menu is huge, so there is little chance of finding something you dislike - but the food itself was on the tasteless side despite being well priced.  Overall, Il Castello wont be somewhere I will be frequenting.",

It's popular with office workers from nearby Castle Terrace, especially on a Friday, although I've never had to wait for a table. The food is delicious and the portions are a good size for lunchtime - satisfying without making you feel too full. The waiters are very friendly, and happy to chat away to customers as if we're friends, which creates a great atmosphere. The food appears freshly prepared and the service is quick enough to comfortably fit into a lunch hour. This place might be quite small, but it's a regular venue of choice for a Friday lunch out that's inexpensive and tastes great!",
