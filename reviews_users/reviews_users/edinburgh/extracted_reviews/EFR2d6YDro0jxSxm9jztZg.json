    "text": "While planning a visit to Scotland with my wife, we came across a review of Illegal Jack's online.  My wife being from Texas figured it wasn't going to be authentic enough, but I convinced her to give it a try.  Having lived in Scotland for some time I felt a personal conviction to defending my statement that Scottish Tex Mex is authentic enough!   I decided to take the reigns from a food selection standpoint.  So once inside and with the menu in front of us, I ordered the staple Tex Mex...chicken burrito and steak tacos, to show that the food is comparable.  Then out of my own curiosity I also ordered the Haggis quesadillas which was a challenge since I also had to explain to my wife what haggis was.  A few minutes later the food emerged from the kitchen piping hot.  As my wife looked at the food, I took the first step and reached out with my right hand...while also keeping my left hand under the table with fingers crossed hoping the food would actually be good!  The Verdict!  The burritos were large, flavourful and juicy. The beef tacos were extremely tender The haggis quesadilla was remarkable!  The flavour of the haggis itself was married beautifully with the cheese, sour cream, and salsa to produce a unique spicy/creamy flavour  While my wife will never admit to saying it was as good or better than anything she would have eaten in Houston, she did say... \"So... we are coming back before flying to Toronto right?\"  4 Stars!",

    "text": "Just went in to Illegal Jack's for takeaway. The tables were not full and there were 2-3 Deliveroo riders waiting ahead of me. I was not greeted by any staff or told that someone would take my order, so I decided to stay and wait until they'd finished the Deliveroo orders. While I was waiting, a man came inside and asked to speak to someone working. The woman behind the counter essentially ignored him with a flustered \"we're busy.\" He waited for a few minutes while the woman was continuing to prepare the same burrito she had been making since I entered the restaurant. Finally, the man very politely said that he wanted to let someone know he found a piece of plastic in his burrito, and repeated he'd like to talk to a supervisor. The staff member informed him it was probably from the top of the squeeze bottles and ignored his request. She did not say so much as \"I'm sorry to hear that\" or offer any compensation. All this time, I'm still standing behind the counter, not being helped. After nearly 10 minutes of waiting without being addressed, I left without ordering my takeaway, and it was probably for the best. Found the name of the restaurant offensive anyways...",

    "text": "OK, we're all geeks here, right? Right. We've all seen Guardians of the Galaxy?   The scene in the prison where all hell breaks loose, and Rocket and Groot are fighting bad guys, and the bad guys are all like \"PEW! PEW! PEW!\" and Rocket doesn't have a gun, and then Drax arrives and is like \"BAM! BAM! BAM!\" and kicks people and throws Rocket a gun, and Rocket says \"Oh.... yeah!\" in an almost religious way?  That \"Oh... yeah!\" was how I felt when I took my first bite out of a Jack's burrito for the first time in a long time this evening.  I donated to the Jackstarter to help Illegal Jack's return from the dead, so I popped in today for the first time since the reopening to see how things had gone (and pick up my swag bag, priorities, people!) and I didn't plan to stay and eat due to lack of time...  Then I saw a couple of burritos being built in front of me. And I smelled the pulled pork... and I caved, people. I folded quicker than a paper tent in a hurricane.  I watched the staff look after the woman ordering two burritos to takeaway, wrapping the first one and leaving it where steam and heat would stop it going cold while the second was assembled. I love attention to detail like that. Also, using the lid of whatever filling you choose to catch any spillage so the fillings aren't cross contaminated. Little things make a difference, people.  It came to be my turn. I opted for carnitas (that's what the pulled pork smell wafted out of) with a mild salsa, sour cream, pinto beans, seasoned rice and cheese. I watched in awe as the burrito was rolled. I really need to learn how to do this myself some day, I took my cup, filled it up with Coke and sat down.  One bite later, I was back in Tex-Mex heaven. I'd missed Jack's, I really had. Other places may have more branches, but quantity isn't quality. Jack's is quality.  The new premises are still a work in progress as Mr. Jack (nice bloke!) explained to me, but are still clean, bright, comfortable and welcoming, and even the music being played ticked all the boxes for me. Black Crowes, Lynyrd Skynyrd? Perfect Tex-Mex music.  Honestly, I can't fault it. I will be back, I will eat too much every time I go, and I wil swear that I'll never do it again. But it's a lie. It's all a pretty little lie...  Oh, and if you're in over the next week or so? Ask about the cranberry salsa - it's astonishing!  Welcome back, Jack. You were missed..",

    "text": "BURRITOS! WHO DOESN'T LOVE EM??  Last night after a long and rainy day at work I coerced two coworkers of mine to join me for a bite out. My bus routes being what they are, I'd not only seen the remnants of the old Illegal Jack's on Lothian Road (though never got to try it), but now had spotted the new location along St. Patrick's Square nestled in the corner. Because we were looking for a budget meal that we could still sit down to, we decided to give Illegal Jack's a go.  The first thing that became apparent to us is that Illegal Jack's has actually employed friendly staff. Wha... what? Where even am I? Walking in the door to being greeted with smiles and genuine friendliness is such a novelty when so many places give you the ambivalent \"I'm being nice because I have to\" luke-warm treatment at best, or downright snubbing at worst. And yet when we walked into Illegal Jack's the two gals at the counter of wonder were chatty and all smiles, and we had a short conversation about how good the music they were playing was. (Guardians of the Galaxy soundtrack anyone?)  Next comes prices. I got a small veggie haggis burrito (score!) that was somewhere around 6 pounds. Normally I'd be greedy and add chips or sides, but even this burrito being small, it's actually massive (I was impressed the gal at the till managed to perfectly roll it, and even smush it all around so the proportions were evenly mixed--MY HERO). So I topped it off with a nice wheat ale from Stewart's and left with my bill around 11 pounds. Not bad at all for a solid beer and a solid burrito.  Next came seating. Illegal Jack's isn't quite up to restaurant standards of atmosphere for obvious reasons, but the seats feel a lot cozier and less standardized than your typical Pinto's or burger chain. We sat down next to a gentleman mysterious staff member who was doing some laptop work--he very nicely jumped to shift some of his things to the side for us so we could sit. Again, as I was remarking loudly that the music was lovely he thanked me for noticing as he must've been the man in charge of the playlist (come on, Grateful Dead was playing, my hippie heart rejoiced!).   But enough about my music tastes. How was the burrito, you may ask? Delicious, of course! That was a really damn solid burrito. My coworker even did a happy dance (twice) whilst she ate it, which I think is a good sign for any burrito. Even more than that, when the gentleman staff sitting next to us noticed my bottle of Louisiana hot sauce on the table he disappeared into the back and plopped down a bottle of Scotch Bonnet + Mango hot sauce from his personal supply in the back for us to try. Damned if it wasn't delicious, but whoo it had some great heat!  Overall I left this place feeling 1) chuffed as all get out 2) with super duper happy tummies 3) pleased at how NICE everyone was and 4) STOKED that I have found an amazing burrito place that I can easily get to (lamenting the fact that Los Cardos is all the way on the other end of town in Leith!).  So if you're fancyin' a fairly-priced burrito in a joint that feels just a little bit closer to home, give Illegal Jack's a scope. I know for certain I'll be back!",

I am going to give the crew a second chance at some point as I visited during the first couple of weeks of opening, so I'm hoping by now they found their feet.  It's a smaller place than the old one on Lothian Road and it does feels a little tight in places, plus the noise carries a little from other diners.  Like Paddy, I do agree on reserving your table as it does get busy at peak periods - Jack's team are more than happy to do this via twitter!  Like I said, I'm not writing this place off and I'm still wanting to go back and be wow'ed ( I really want to be wow'ed).  Just, my quesadilla wasn't really rocking my world this visit and I'm just hoping it was because of the festival crowds and the first few weeks.  I'm pleased that Jack is back and didn't lie down too long and let his dream fade.",

    "text": "I used to frequent Illegal Jack's went it was on Lothian Road. It managed to feel somewhere in between fast food and somewhere were you could sit with friends and have a couple of beers with your burrito. There is no Chipotle in Edinburgh and Jack's managed to do alright as a substitute.   After a hiatus, Jack re-appeared in Saint Patrick Square. I was here earlier in the summer soon after it opened and unfortunately had not been very impressed. It seemed to be lacking a lot of the charm that it once had and the food had been below bar.  I tried again and found things had improved (or I had just had bad luck the first time). It was a lot quieter which helped. The burrito was pretty much what I expected; it didn't blow me away but then again it's still a burrito at the end of the day and you can only do so much. I went for the Carnitas pulled pork - it was good but it could have been warmer. At 8 it's not the cheapest meal but it is pretty sizeable. Their spicy salsa seemed pretty fresh but it didn't have enough kick of my liking.  The venue itself definitely lacks compared to the one on Lothian Road. It feels a lost more like a fast food place and not somewhere you would want to meet with friends. They are making the most of a small space though.   If your after a burrito... well there isn't much choice. I don't think Jack's doesn't have quite the same appeal as it used to but I much prefer it to Pinto's offerings, so I will give it 4 stars rather than 3. Los Cardos on Leith Walk would still be my number 1 though.",

If it's busy find your table first then queue.  A really decent haunt for tasty Mexican grub. The burritos are ridiculously large...like I could club someone to death with it large! If you're just a normal human being level of hungry then order the small one. The carnitas here is really tasty and the salsas are tasty too. The tacos I'm assured were equally as lovely. The only thing I would say is that a token few tortilla chips on the side wouldn't go a miss. Other than that the service is friendly, The food arrives quickly and it's pretty yummy. Pretty much all you need to know really.  Oh the parking around the restaurant is seriously lame so factor that into things when you head here. You may be better off catching a cab or bus :)",

From the moment the kickstarter opened on for new investors to help open the new improved restaurant I couldn't help but put a few quid in.  Until today I hadn't managed to get over to try their magnificent produce. They are about a 15 minute walk from the royal mile but we'll worth the trek.  Rough and ready interior but it suits the venue and the atmosphere.  The staff are amazing really nice polite and know their stuff.  The food is unbelievably good.  A nice menu with lots of choice.  A good selection of beers and soft drinks. And the prices are in line with Edinburgh rates for good food.  Get down to jacks and enjoy.",

The new place on St Patrick's square is a lot smaller than the old place on Lothian road, so I'd advise booking ahead, I bet this place fills up fast. For those that remember the decor of the old place would probably agree the new spot has a warmer, and more rustic feel too it, and certainly doesn't have the \"this used to be a Pizza Hut\" vibe about it.   As for the familiar, there's AC/DC blastin out the stereo, and the food is rich and filling. My burrito was a little imbalanced, with mostly rice down one side of it, but when I managed a big mouthful I got the amazing fresh salsa, guacamole, and juicy chicken all together which was lush.   If you loved jacks before then you'll be delighted it's back. If you weren't then I suspect the new spot won't win you over. Jack has a dream and he won't let a silly little thing like his business getting liquidated get in the way.   Jackaholic4life.",

All the original hitters are still here with a few tweaks. Can get busy but they now reserve so plan ahead or get it to go.
