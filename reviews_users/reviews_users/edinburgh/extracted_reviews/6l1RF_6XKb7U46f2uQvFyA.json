There is a fully stocked bar with a wide range of Gins and Vodkas on offer as well as a nice wine selection by the glass. There is also an extensive cocktail list.  The food was fresh, very well cooked and packed with flavour. It was also notably well presented.   The meal was extremely good value for money and I would definitely return if in the area again.",

    "text": "The OH spotted an itison voucher for 5 tapas to share & a drink each. neither of us had ever tried The Priory before we decided to give it a shot.  Service was good but the tapas was a bit of a letdown. We went for the haggis dumplings, meatballs, calamari, fishcakes & the croquetas to share.  The haggis dumplings just didn't work. The haggis filling was nice but the dumpling was too chewy & too large & not a good match the strong flavour of the haggis. The rest of the tapas was mediocre. There was nothing bad about the other dishes but nothing great either. In a city with lots of tapas restaurants they need to up their game to compete.  Maybe the other food on the menu is of a better standard. I wouldn't rule out popping in there again if I was in the area but I wouldn't be making a special trip across town to visit.",

    "text": "Either I'm missing something or the Priory is missing something because whatever it was just wasn't entirely right on my visit to the Priory Saturday night.    Were we too early?  We arrived just before 6 and left just before 7 so maybe that was the case, but I've never before been in a bar in Edinburgh on a Saturday night and had it effectively dead. I mean, I think there may have been four other people (two groups) before we arrived?    The Priory is decorated in that standard way of wood meet industrial meet quirky accents. I like it, but it's not exactly clever anymore is it?    It also looked like they had a function room downstairs (the Priory is surprisingly massive) which comedically contained bright purple upholstered booths.    The other reviews talk about a good cocktail menu and while I love a good cocktail, boozy drinks aren't exactly on my radar at the moment so I gave this a pass. I did wish they had a few interesting non-alcoholic options as those on offer were pretty bog standard - Schweppes ginger beer, fountain soda, probably some juice, not much else.   Flip side, the boys seemed happy with the small but adequate selection of draught beer and we were able to get a table no problem.  Additionally the girl who served us at the bar was very lovely and chatty.   So, all in all the Priory was a-ok for getting a pre-dinner drink but with all of the great bars in Edinburgh, I probably won't be rushing back.",

My cocktail was a bit meh but Jenny and Laura's choices were lovely. Menu looks great and I do plan a return visit to try as lots of tasty options and I would like to further explore the cocktail menu...",

We ordered the sea bass, which was delicious, and the beef burger, which was very good though the chips had a little too much salt on them. However, that was a minor gripe. I would definitely eat here again and would recommend it to others.",
