    "text": "Wonderful wee coffee shop that embodies everything I love about Scotland...stone walls, slate floors, functional plaid seating and tons of reclaimed wood. This place has a really cosy and warm feel. Congrats to whoever designed the space I just love it. The staff are so kind and are welcoming...they'll let you sit and work while leisurely enjoying your drink or baked good. There's good banter and not to mention compliments from the staff too. Really honest and sincere baristas! Have only been to a few coffee places in Edinburgh as I normally make my own, but out of those this is the best. The coffee, tea, and scones are also wonderful. I had a triple shot flat white which was wonderfully prepared and presented in a lovely blue cup. I got a fruit-based tea called Cloud catcher and this came wonderfully presented also on a tray with the teapot, cup, and an adorable little hourglass to help time steeping. The sultana scone was again most well served with two artisanal clay pots of Graham's butter and what I believe was Bonne Maman Strawberry Jam. The scone was melt-in your mouth biscuit of British deliciousness. I could spend the rest of my life studying in the corner of this shop with my laptop (and yes free wifi!) watching the locals and tourists go in and out as I contemplate the meaning of life. Can't thank my barber, Luke at Sink & Anchor enough for recommending this coffee shop! Best thing that happened to my boring WASP life.",

The coffee  and scones were good ( coffee was very small) but my daughter asked if they had any sweetner to which the reply was just No ! Then they carried on chatting amongst themselves ..I think we were disturbing them and also the rugby he was either watching or listening too. Our cups and plates were whisked away without asking if we had finished ( my daughter hadn't ) and we felt they wanted us to leave. Which we gladly did . Shame really as it could be a nice cafe .",

It was lovely to get away from the large groups of visitors walking up the royal mile while enjoying some great coffees and pastries.   This small cafe has a very nice atmosphere that feels inviting and cool without being to hipster-y. The barista was very welcoming and worked quickly to serve everyone in a timely manner.   We got two drinks, a simple latte and a mocha, both were very good and the flavor of the blend was very pleasing. The mocha did not taste like a simple hot chocolate as so many other places' mochas normally do. We also had two pastries, a chocolate croissant and and an almond croissant. Both were light and buttery, and the chocolate was nice and rich.   I will definitely be stopping in again next time I'm in Edinburgh!",

With seating for maybe 5 people and no other standing room your only other hope is then really to be a takeaway coffee shop but there isn't really the service space for that and the ordering/collecting point are side by side so there's no place for a queue to form and feed through to.  The coffee is nice, my flat white was pretty good. The roast is subtle so for me as a flat white is lacked a bit of a kick. We went for the lemon drizzle cake, GF which is nice. The bake was dense and not as light & crumbly as I would like. The cake had peel baked it which was bitter, quite nice.   If you're not a take away and you don't have space for people to sit and relax I just struggle to see how you will compete with the likes of Wellington for city centre business.  I do however wish them luck.   N.B. for business owner: tell your staff to get off their mobile phones in front of customers its not very professional especially when its in front of you.",

    "text": "Love it! Cozy little artisan coffee and tea shop tucked in-between a line of shops, across the street from a steep staircase leading away from The Royal Mile. It reminds me of the hipster specialty coffee roasters in Midtown Sacramento (home in the US). I ordered a mocha, my husband ordered a latte, and we split a scone. All were divine! What I love about the mocha is that the dark, bitter chocolate makes for a more subtle flavor (not sweet), and it collects in small bits at the bottom of the mug (so I enjoyed scooping it up with a small spoon at the end). The coffee art on the latte and mocha were beautifully crafted. The scone was a bit crumbly and also moist, which I was pleasantly surprised by (most scones I've tried have had a drier texture). The Milkman sells chocolates, which look like mini peanut butter cups, in a jar by the register for 1 pound each -- SO WORTH IT -- These rich, dark chocolates are filled with peanut butter and caramel and sea salt is sprinkled on top. I loved the vibe and tastes of this place so much that I insisted we return the following day (and am so glad we did)! The baristas are friendly and chill. The indoor seating is rather limited (only a handful of places to sit) and there are a few chairs outside, but of course no one sits there when it's raining (which seems to happen somewhat often around here). Luckily, we stopped in when it wasn't busy and had our choice of indoor seating. I definitely recommend this place and would love to return yet another time if it works out during our short time left in Edinburgh!",

And I'm glad I brought a good friend with me to share this beautiful moment of excellent flat white skills.  But first, I'll try and give you a picture of what it is like inside.   It's pretty cosy - say 10 seats at most and would potentially fill up quickly. It's very rustic but has a trendy vide too. The background music is quite chilling and not too loud if you were trying to have a conversation. The staff are super nice and a have a dab hand at doing latte art too.  Now the flat white. So let's get down to business ... So creamy and smooth and my friend agreed wholeheartedly also.   There are pastries and cakes too but I was too full from lunch.   But I did have room for one more super smooth flat white to help me bounce all the way home :)",

Perfectly nutty and delicious flavor -- they even warmed up the oat milk on the sude. Super cozy spot near the train/bus station with great people watching. Pastries looked delicious as well.",

My party and I had been looking for a quick place to get warm and stumbled upon the Milkman, since it was close to closing we initially felt bad because the staff was cleaning up. To my surprise they stopped all they were doing and helped us even when we couldn't decide which treat we wanted! I was very appreciative of their patience and we were thrilled by the taste of the coffee and cakes! When back in Edinburgh I will be putting the Milkman on my cafe musts!",

We couldn't drop our bags at the house yet so it was very nice to be able to come here without getting nay gripe from the baristas for having a suitcase.  The latte was fantastic and beautifully made. I loved the decor - chill vibe and eclectic style. It's a small shop but feels cozy. I had a cinnamon bun that was yeasty and delicious - fresh a couple hours earlier i am sure. Highly recommended!",

Definitely a place to stop if you are picky about your coffee while in Edinburgh.",

Excited that I was (finally) able to source some gluten free pastries: the salted caramel brownie.  The texture was more than favorable for gluten free and the flavour excellent.   Prices fair for quality as 2 coffees and 3 pastries ran 14.   Small space surrounding inside. provides about 6-8, maybe 10 seats. Two tables are outside when the weather is fair.   Milkman came highly recommended and didn't disappoint.",

    "text": "Going to local, independent businesses is important to us when we travel. So searching for a local coffee shop brought us to the Milkman. It was a Tuesday morning around 10:30. There were some people at the tables out front, and some inside. It appeared to be a mix of local business people and students. It seemed like we were the only tourists, which quite frankly, I loved.   The ambiance is delightful with old stone walls and charming decor.   The man and woman working there welcomed us warmly. Good people can make or break a place for me, and these people were friendly, helpful, and efficient.  I got a mocha. Delicious. My friend couldn't decide, so they recommended the Cloud Catcher tea. When it cooled down enough to drink, haha, it was quite tasty. Fruity but natural flavor, not the cloying, sweet artificial fruitiness. They do have food that looked really good, but as we didn't eat we can't vouch for it.  Though it appeared to be mostly locals as patrons, it is in a great location for travelers... close to Waverly station, or easy access from High Street via one of a few closes, or just down the hill of Cockburn St.  We enjoyed it so much we went back the following morning. And we will go back again, next time we're in Edinburgh.",

Luckily, this gem was located just down the hill from our Airbnb (shout out to Andrew, the best hockey-loving, Scottish Airbnb host)  When I visit somewhere new, I like to try a different coffee shop every morning. Out of the 3 we tried in Edinburgh, this was by far my favorite. Ordered the latte and a  breakfast version of a Cranachan. Both solid choices.  Best Part? The historic storefront is absolutely adorable (dare I say, instagram-worthy).  It's cozy (aka small with a few chairs) on the inside but doesn't seem to get too crowded.",
