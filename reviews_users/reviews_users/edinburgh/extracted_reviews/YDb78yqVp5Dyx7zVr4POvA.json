    "text": "We stopped in for dinner with a large group of friends and we were quite pleasantly surprised! The restaurant was very accomodating to a large group despite not being a huge place, and the food came out relatively quick! The service was nice and we were all able to relax with plenty of water refills and pints. It was a stormy evening but if the weather was better, we would have loved to take advantage of the patio area. It's in a very cute part of Leith so I'd definitely recommend stopping in.  I had the mussells and they were cooked well-very tender and lots of zest. Dessert is my favorite part of any meal, so naturally I got enough for 2 all to myself. The wine selection was also awesome and my glass of wine was very smooth. The vibe of the place is sophisticated yet casual, making it a friendly favorite for couples with children as well as flying solo and sipping a coffee. I really enjoyed my experience here. What a hidden gem!",

Some of the fish went back, but I think that was the person eating it and nothing wrong with the food.  I had beef with a mushroom gravy, which was pretty nice.  A few folks had pork belly, and they said it was nice.  A good drink selection was available as well.  The main drawback to this place was the noise.  It was so loud in here with 40 people that you couldn't have a normal conversation with people nearby.  Made it difficult to enjoy the meal.",

    "text": "Decent spot to grab a bite, but nothing special.   Came in because I was staying close by. Sadly they don't offer lunch until noon, so I had to settle for the breakfast menu. The restaurant is nice, with an indoor-outdoor space in the back. Service is nice too, if a bit slow because they're a bit understaffed.   I ordered the egg benedict and mocha. The egg benedict was good, but a tad overpriced for the area. Perhaps worthy of 4 stars, but what brings down the rating is the mocha. They didn't make it properly/stir it, because all the chocolate was clumped at the bottom and it didn't taste sweet at all. Disappointing...   I think perhaps this place would be nicer for lunch or dinner, but don't waste your time here in the early am with so many other fantastic restaurants around.",

What I don't like is the flavour of the food, or rather the lack of it.  It is too bland for my taste. I ordered a Onion soup and a Croque Madame.  Both times the bread was 'big' but small on actual flavour.   adding salt 'n pepper does lift it up a bit, but I think base flavour should be there. True, this is subjective, but nonetheless annoying.",

Only criticism was it lacked an authentic French feel about it. With a surf & turf option and a burger on the menu it felt a little muddled what type of restaurant is was pitching itself as. Maybe catering for a wider audience. Only a minor thing really as the quality of the food is what counts. Really enjoyed it.",

The interior was extremely comfortable and they had a fantastic selection of European wines. They also had a very quaint outside over-looking the river.  The staff was helpfully to assist us in picking our wines, since we are from the states and not versed in the region based naming of their wines. I noticed they had a selection of foods and desserts, but did not consider them since we were about to go to dinner next.  I wished I had more time in Edinburgh because I would have liked to ate here, so if I am lucky and get to visit Scotland again I will definitely stop on in.",

    "text": "I have to agree, this new French-influenced restaurant in Victoria Quay really deserves high praise, and is great news to those of us still mourning the loss of Daniel's Bistro a few years back. It used to be a pretty mediocre Mexican joint, where I once got a bowl of chilli before the cinema but never went back to, but this whole experience couldn't be more different.   The decor's great - very light and stylish, and not at all intimidating. The same can be said of the friendly and attentive staff, who really bent over backwards to make our meal (a 91st birthday party) feel really special.  I played it safe and went for the burger, and was rewarded with a rich, perfectly seasoned hunk of meat, wonderfully charred on the outside while pink and moist in the centre. The accompanying fries and salad would also easily have passed muster across the channel.  The others in my party were a little more adventurous, choosing from the good range of fish, meat and (say it quietly) vegetarian options, and everyone came away feeling they'd made the best choice. Surely a good sign.",

    "text": "What a completely unexpected delight to come across this gem in Leith this afternoon.  Even with a large party of 60 booked in at 6ish, we were given a 7 pm reservation for four (4). The service was great - professional and knowledgeable service staff. The appetizers - charcuterie and cheese platter for sharing and others - fried goose egg and smoked salmon. - presented with obvious care and attention to details.  And so delicious.  The bread was substantial and good! The mains - being a somewhat drizzly evening - had two of us ordering the boeuf bourgignion. Beautiful Scottish beef with the expected baby onions and quartered mushrooms with potato mash to melt in the mouth. So very tasty. The other two (2) mains: pork cutlets and Scottish sirloin - again amazing.   For dessert, sadly ( we had full tummies ) we could only share one (1) - almond and fig tart - freshly baked and out of the oven; served with vanilla ice cream and some custard - MMMMmmmm.  Chef Hamish is a talent not to be passed by.  Be sure to make a reservation and go to this restaurant.  You won't forget this meal.",

    "text": "This is a great place for Sunday breakfast and even a Scottish breakfast and the atmosphere is mellow so you can bring your kids or dogs or even both. That being said you will have to endorse kids screening wile you are trying to enjoy your breakfast. The crepes are great for breakfast or dinner. I have had breakfast lunch and dinner here and the food has been great. I had ribeye stake and it was cooked perfectly however the chips were soggy and cold by the time I got to them. The frustration of having a great steak with soggy chips that were cold when I got them was a little frustrating. The chips are easy to get right and even easier to get wrong by cooking them to early and having them sit on the hot line. I had a salad  with red onions and oil. There was no balance and it had so many onions I had to take 3/4 of them off just to finish it, and there was no balance of clavier it was bitter greens no flavor they could have marinated the onions in a sweet poaching liquor to give it a complete finish. If you are still reading I will say all that was just a half stare the service here is hit or miss and when it's good it's great but when it's bad it is horrible. One time I came with my boss and it took them forever to take our order because we did not arrive on time our orders did not come to the table at the same time and our waitress was missing in action and I had to get the pudding menus myself. When we ordered coffee with our pudding it never came. When I when got my stake my waitress was the same one from lunch and I gave her the benefit of the doubt. I was left with the same service. As soon as I sat down she asked me what I wanted to drink I said I would like a sparkling water and I would have to look at the menu. She never told me what the specials were and wile I was reading she came back less than a minute later ( yes I know it was less than a minute because I was looking at my phone after she came the second time) she bent over to get close to my face because I was waiting a baseball hat so she got so close to me I was startled and I did not even want to know the specials let alone get a bottle of wine. This cost them a 23 I could have ordered. I just got a bottle beer to get her away from me. When I was ready to order she could not understand me and I had to point to what I was ordering. Then her questions started I understand English might not be her first language and I herd her speaking Polish to the cupel next to me. I understand it's hard to come to a country but if you get a job that you have to interact with people you must be proficient in it. I can tell they do not have a numbering system because if the food is run by someone else than the one that took the order they have no idea where it goes and I even noticed when the food came to the table they did not know who gets what. The is service 101. When o got my steak I didn't have time to pick up my fork and knife before Monika asked me how it was. It looked great and that is all I could tell her and she turned away before I could ask her for a new napkin because mine had gotten wet, I was finding up my strake and she finally can back to ask how it was when I had my mouth full. How are you going to sake that then? The service is where this place is lacking you can't be inconsistent and expect the best. If they work on this the would be a place I would recommend but not right now when there are so many great places to go. I wanted to like this but I base my ruling off all the meals. And one thing that was the icing on the cake was when I was paying with my card it asked about gratuity and here is my TIP train your servers to give a great service in this industry and you have a great place till then it's mediocre.",
