    "text": "Bonnie Burrito was exactly what I was after at the time; fast, fresh food that I could eat on the go. At the moment, the cafe is fairly basic on the inside but, since it is a new addition to Newington, I'm sure it will develop some personality with time.   I went for the veggie haggis burrito which was full of flavour and topped with one of their homemade sauces from which are there are several to choose. I don't always feel like meat and I know of competing businesses doing veggie specials so it would be nice to see Bonnie Burrito mix it up and expand on their veggie options. Portion size is also a little smaller than competitors.  For me, the service stood out. Having asked me if I'd had Bonnie Burrito before, I said yes, at their truck at an event in Stirling. I recognised the guy serving me and we chatted a little about the festival which they had been a street food vendor at and also which my band had played. He gave me a loyalty card which he stamped twice; once for the burrito I was about to enjoy and also for the one I had devoured in Stirling. That was a really nice gesture and one which definitely has me inclined to make a return visit!",

    "text": "My guy and I were in the area to see some live music and were wanting something quick and delicious.  When we want something like that we automatically want to search out burritos.    I attempted to contact Bonnie Burrito to see if this location was even in operation because their website only mentions a food truck in another part of town but my emails were not returned until a few days after we were in town.  Luckily it wasn't too far from the venue so we took a wander down and noticed it was open.  Hooray!  This place is pretty bare bones and you can see straight back in to the kitchen area, which I'm not the biggest fan of when it comes to take away joints.  That's just my personal opinion though.  The set up is somewhat like the other burrito places in Scotland, you walk up to the counter, order what you want and then you're walked through a load of ingredients to choose from.  Cool thing about Bonnie Burrito is that they have haggis available for your burritos.  We both went with our usual of a chicken burrito.  To be fair, they were pretty tasty, but seemed a bit small for the price.  There is very little seating here (two window seats that were taken when we walked in) so we took our burritos to go.  The staff were friendly enough and the ingredients seemed fresh.  I'd stop in again if we were in the area and wanting burritos for sure.",

    "text": "Excellent place to get your burrito fixings! I ordered with veggie haggis and fajita peppers for fillings with the usual (rice, beans, sour cream, guacamole, jalapenos). The server was super friendly and nice. He's the one with a tattoo sleeve on his right arm - give him a good raise! :) It's a small place and they only have one table that seats five. They deliver, which i think will come in handy for students. Their prices are affordable. We'll probably head to this place one more time before we head back to Portland, Oregon (USA).",
