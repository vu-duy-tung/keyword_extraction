We were there between lunch and dinner times for a late lunch and the restaurant was lacking in atmosphere.  The calzone was HUGE, definitely a case of quantity over quality as I was most blown away by the generous portion as opposed to the filling and flavours. Service was friendly too. Perfectly A-OK; nothing blowing me away.  Other than that, I don't have a whole lot to say other than that Edinburgh has far more interesting places to eat and some awesome little hidden gems worth seeking out. - All things considered, Zizzi is fairly unoriginal.",

    "text": "I ordered the Casareccia Pollo Piccante pasta on the waitress's recommendation, and its described as a pasta with spicy piccante chicken in a creamy sauce with fresh tomatoes and baby spinach. No. Just no. This was some of the most mediocre and lacking pasta I've ever had. First off, the sauce was more watery and runny than creamy, and I was not a fan. There were maybe 2 tomatoes total. The chicken pieces were tough and I prefer my chicken more tender. And the overall flavors were lacking, and more on the bland side than anything else. So clearly I did not like my main dish.   But at least the dessert turned out well. I ordered the Vegan caramelized biscuit cheesecake, which was a dairy-free cheesecake on a cinnamon biscuit base with crushed honeycomb. It was definitely good for a vegan dessert. I liked the added texture of the honeycomb (cereal?) crumbs and bits they added on top.  Total was 18.25 pounds and wasn't worth it considering how little I liked my main dish.",

I had the King Prawn Pasta which was supposed to be spicy but it was like someone had thrown a spoonfull of chili powder over a skimpy and bland sauce. I had to marvel at how they managed to cook something so devoid of any kind of flavour? I mean... tomatoes? My son in the meantime was rejecting his Spaghetti Pomodoro for the same reasons. The waitress came and seemed to know what the problem was and refunded part of the meal and was professional. Disappointing and NEVER again! FAIL!",

They don't have any veggie calzones on the menu but did do one on request.  The mushroom calzone was actually very tasty and I loved the rosemary garlic bread with sea salt on top.  Not bad price too with the voucher.  I ordered a sprite and asked for no ice and a straw, they did a weird thing of pouring into a short tumbler but then adding a long straw that just kept falling out the glass as it didn't fit.  I quickly ditched that.    I liked the food and the new decor but the tables were squished too close together and it took an age to get the bill.  The decor and food are great, the staff were wandering about a bit and not achieving much!",

    "text": "when trying to book a table the last friday before christmas i was stuck.  phoning a few places clearly showed that even at 6pm they were all booked solid for the evening and with a my fingers crossed and last bit of hope i phoned Zizzi to see if there was the chance of a free table.  the man who answered the phone very happily assured me that there was and took my booking.  now i know edinburgh is all about the independent restaurants and bars, but sometimes the reliability of a chain does come in handy.  especially when you're wanting a relatively quick dinner at a decent price.  when we arrived friday we were shown a table in the middle of the dining room but after seeing another couple more from a table near the window which appeared quieter we asked to be moved there.  they happily accomdated us and we were soon sat contemplating menus.  after a rather lengthy wait trying to get our waitress' attention we eventually managed to order and food arrived shortly.  i think it's hard to do italian wrong and Zizzi definitely is a place that gets it right.  i had a chicken and spinach calzone which was really quite good, full of spinach and a bechamel sauce with a dried ham on top.  it could have used a bit more chicken but overall it was quite good.  the white wine we got with the meal was easy to drink and a good price.  the only downfall was the wait to actually order food when it appeared our waitress had actually forgotten that we existed.  however for a quick meal on one of the busiest friday nights of the year this was a good option.",

I ordered a skinny Pizza( guaranteed to be under 500 calories) and It was like chewing cardbboard ( not that I have ever munched on cardboard, but you know what I mean) I should have gone for the full fatty pizza, which I have to say are pretty tasty, So if you do go to zizz's order a pizza as they are they best option on the menu. The pasta dishes are created by the chef who then  thin decides what should go into it instead of what you order/expecitng. Value wise it isnt bad but I think youd be better going elsewhere for 8-13 per main course. The decor is sligtly clinical with all the metalic tables and everytme I removed myself from the table I banged my head on a low light and I am only 5'5 ish ( 5'8 with hair bun) so its not the best designed. Its an ok establishment for meeting for a quick meal and catch up with friends, but If I wanted to make it a special occasion then Id choose somewhere else.",

A friend, who lives in Edinburgh, invited me for dinner one night when she had a massive cooker disaster. It totally died on her so we had to decide whether to eat in or take out, so we opted to get the heels on and make a night of it. Zizzi's had been recommended to my friend by her college lecturer, so we decided to try that.  It is the fast food joint of 'Italian' restaurants. Everything looks smashing on paper but just falls short of the mark in a lot of ways.  -Olives and bread with dipping oil. Good, but not enough for two ravenous girls like us. -Garlic bread. Tasteless. I think she may have misheard us and just brought us bread sans garlic. -Linguine Gamberini. My usual prawn and tomato pasta. Lacking in something, namely the prawns which I think must have been some of the smallest I have seen. Not impressed. It was also cold, not sure how they managed that one.  Not good guys. I would like to think we caught them on an off day but sadly, by the looks of other reviews, perhaps its just like this at all times.",

But don't let that fool you, as the food is great for the most part. The calzone I had on my last visit was copious and very tasty, and the pizzas my table ordered were delicious and still managed to taste authentic. One of my friends, however, ordered pasta and was not very impressed, but he works as a chef so might be biased! The service is also really good, they are friendly and not overbearing and give you the right level of attention. Also, as far as locations go, you can't much more central than Zizzi. Whether you want to ramble through the old town after your meal or go drinking in the trendy new town area, you're only a brief stride from either.",
