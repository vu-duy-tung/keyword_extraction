What really motivated me to write a review was the wait staff's courteous manner and general concienciousness. They were available whenever we needed them and even brought over a spare heater because they saw my significant other was chilled. I was rather impressed and I'll be in again next time I'm in town.",

Sure enough, we did not regret it! I got the veggie Korma with rice and my partner got another curry dish. Both were excellent, and the spice level they were rated on the menu was accurate. The naan was also amazing.  Our meal (2 main coarses, 2 sides of rice, side of naan, 1 glass of wine and one cider) came out to 34 pounds. Not bad! At the end of the meal they gave us little warm clothes to whipe our hands which was a charming touch. Staff very friendly and suggested vegetarian dishes.",

    "text": "In the words of David K, 'NPWH (nice people work here).'  The friendly, pleasant matron of the house came and chatted with us after we stuffed our faces full of delightful Indian cuisine. It turns out that she's Italian (which led to our earlier confusion about why some white lady was running an Indian restaurant) but her husband (and chef) is Indian. Mystery solved!  At any rate, this is legit grub. It may be pricey (especially compared to the offerings one can find on Manchester's Curry Mile) but for being in Edinburgh, the ability to score real South Asian eats is a pleasant surprise.   If you're into spicy food - be sure to give the vindaloo a try. The boy likes it -hot-, and Spice Pavilion's version certainly had my nose beading up with sweat.  Also lending to the traditional British Indian restaurant offerings, you'll find Cobra on draught. Be sure to have a pint or two on hand if you're choosing menu offerings heavy on the capsaicin. I guarantee you'll want a sip of something cold at hand to douse your tongue.  Considering the extensive selection of veg and non-veg courses featured in the densely-packed tome of a menu, it appears that I'll have plenty more to try upon future returns. Needless to say, I'm looking forward to the opportunity!",

Seriously, the service was absolute gold, and the food wasn't far behind that standard, either. Well worth a visit.  Overall, we said: \"I really enjoyed the whole restaurant experience in the Spice Pavilion. The service was just great, put you right at your ease, and allowed you to relax and enjoy your lunch at your leisure, in the smart surroundings. It was prompt and accurate, as well as being overwhelmingly welcoming. The food is fresh and flavour-packed, too, thereby ensuring that every aspect of our time in the place was a complete pleasure.\"",

My only concern is the decor, like some other places in Edinburgh its very simple decorated, clean with white walls, i think though this place could add a little more cozy touch, darker walls and soft lightning.",

But a quick google search found the Spice Pavilion and I thought it was worth a try.  I believe the style is Kashmiri, and the food was really excellent.  We ate Garlic Chicken, Kathmandu Murgh (with lentils and garlic), and a Saag Aloo.  The Saag Aloo was the star dish, but all three were truly excellent.  The service was fine, although I was a little unsure about the way food is served from a trolley, but otherwise fine.  The ambience was relaxed and children appeared to be welcome in the early evening.  I wouldn't hesitate to return next time I'm in Edinburgh.",

    "text": "We chose The Spice Pavillon based on location, yelp reviews and hope. We were so lucky that we went. The food was amazing. There were six of us, so we were able to try several dishes. Hands down, the Dansak was the favorite. It was flavorful, aromatic, texturally interesting, and a little spicy. The sag aloo was the best any of us had ever had. I always thought you ordered it to include a 'vegetable' -this you'd order because it was delicious. We ordered the aiwjani jhinga,also great, but we'll have to see if the healing properties cure my husband's aching knee.   The pakoras were delicious (though we did expect the cilantro chutney we get in California, we can't complain since we're not in ca) . The chicken korma was redolent of coconut, which we was unexpected but delicious and a mild contrast to some of e spicier dishes. And the nizat ghosht (none of these foods are spelled correctly) The staff was very patient with the six indecisive Americans, and we thank them.",

We tried the pompadon which came with a great chutney tray, and a truly excellent saag paneer. The entrees (briyani, and chicken tika masala) were tasty, came in good portions, and were well cooked - overall a bit better than average. Service was a bit slow, but not truly bad untill we asked for the check. Our waiter started asking if we enjoyed the Hogmany/fireworks the previous evening, which we had, then proceeded to rant about how it was a waste of money that should go to starving children worldwide. The rest of the process was filled with huffing and dirty looks. I'm not insensitive to these problems, but getting lectured while I'm paying the bill really ruined an otherwise great evening with very good food.",

The decor is very nice and there are photos of India scattered around and every table has a small bunch of flowers on it. The prices are a bit higher than the average, but it is definitely worth it as the quality of the food is so good, fortunately it was my parents who footed the bill. We started by ordering a couple of Papadums each, which were very crispy and they came with a large selection of sauces to complement them. I also got a large bottle of Kingfishers beer for 3. For the main course I had my favourite curry- chicken rogan josh, and the chicken was lovely and tender and the sauce was full of flavour. We also order naans for the meal and they weren't greasy at all, which you find in many other restaurants. My Dad is a curry veteran and has at least one a week and even he was full of praise for The Spice Pavilion. I am already looking forward to returning soon!",

    "text": "Had a fantastic meal at The Spice Pavilion on 17 Aug 2012. Based in a New Town basement, it eschews the twee fixtures and fittings that normally scream 'Indian!' However, in the interest of balance, I should not that the waiters were dressed in slightly twee tartan waistcoats and the phraseology of the menu is a little eccentric. The only complaint I'd have of the stylish but cosy interior was that, on the muggy evening we arrived, it was uncomfortably warm. Fortunately we were seated by a window which we were able to open. The food was great, amazing flavours and all clearly freshly made. There were none of the oily bowls of indiscriminate gloop that all too many Indian restaurants churn out. A particular highlight was the 'Atishi lamb chops'; deliciously tender chucks of spiced meat that had me gnawing every last scrap off the bone. Three courses for two people, including a nice bottle of viognier for 17 (house wines start at 13), came to 63. I left trying to plan when we can go back.",
