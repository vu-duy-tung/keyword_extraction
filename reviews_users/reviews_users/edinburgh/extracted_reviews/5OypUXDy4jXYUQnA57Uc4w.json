    "text": "A solid three stars for Happy Bean. I popped round on my lunch break for some soup and wasn't disappointed. Soup du jour was tomato and basil with a swirl of of sun-dried tomato oil. 1.50 for a good size and with as much free homemade croutons as you fancy.  Service was charming; just enough to tempt me back next time I'm unprepared come lunch at work.  Happy Bean is a warm and unassuming spot, just waiting to be found on Easter Road. Conveniently, my current place of work is just round the corner!",
