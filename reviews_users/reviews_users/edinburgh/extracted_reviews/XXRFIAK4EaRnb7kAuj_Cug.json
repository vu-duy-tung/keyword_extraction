    "text": "Great little local cafe. Offerings are simple (mostly sandwiches, snacks, pastry, coffee, daily specials), but good. Homemade pastry goods and very good coffee. Staff cannot be more helpful or kind. Prices are incredibly cheap - biggest eggs & beans on toast Ive ever had in my life for only 1.80! Hidden away on Ashley Terrace this place is a community gem and deserves your business.",

    "text": "What a delightful surprise just up the road from my flat! After a day filled with errands I decided a quick stop in blueberry was just the ticket. When I arrived around two I very quickly realized I wasn't the only one with the idea for a pop in, as all of the tables were full and there was a wee line in an already wee place!   What I noticed while I stood in line pondering what to get was the extremely reasonable prices. Around two pounds for a baked tattie with some fixings? Less for sandwiches? Awesome! If there had been a place to sit I may well have gotten real food, but as it was I got a small latte and a piece of millionaire's shortbread, all for the extremely reasonable price of between two and three pounds. Not bad considering how much one drink from S-bucks is!   The staff was very friendly despite being eyeballed hungrily by the line of folk waiting to be served, and when I tried both my treats after leaving I was pleased as punch. Both were perfectly lovely!  Have already mentioned this place to the other half and will definitely be back to scope out the noms!",

    "text": "I couldn't believe Blueberry Hill wasn't on Yelp. Maybe its because it caters for a breakfast/lunch crowd, but I love this little local gem and its an escape when working from home :-)  Its small (about 5 tables that seat between 2 and 4 at each) but very popular with locals of all ages and can fill up very quickly as people pile in.   Does the usual cafe food: sandwiches (my fav is chicken, chorizo & lime pickle on brown gf bread but my mum swears by the roast beef which is cooked in-house) as well as soups and baked potatoes.   Specials change constantly and today included chowder, baked trout and quorn chilli. Cakes are homemade and cover everything from tray bakes to cheesecake.  This place is a gem - cheap but excellent fresh food - 4 stars, but only because I've not had cake yet...",
