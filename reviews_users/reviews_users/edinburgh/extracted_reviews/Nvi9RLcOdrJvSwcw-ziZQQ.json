Lebowski's apparently started as a theme bar, but now the only things Lebowski related are the name, the picture of Walter on the wall, and a bunch of named White Russian varieties on the menu. Otherwise its just a standard pub.    This is apparently part of a conscious effort to change from a novelty place people might go to once to check out to more of a neighborhood pub that folks would make their regular joint.  Lebowskis is large, has plenty of seating, the food and the service were decent. If I lived in Edinburgh and were going to be in the neighborhood I would definitely consider stopping by. But it's not necessarily work taking a trip out there for, especially if you're thinking it's going to be some sort of mecca of Lebowskiana.",

    "text": "Awesome themed bar.  Personally, I hate the movie and find it a waste of 2 hours of my life, but my boyfriend and some of the friends we were traveling with absolutely LOVES this movie and made it a goal to come to this bar by the end of our trip.  It's pretty difficult to theme a bar or restaurant after something and not make it extremely tacky (ahem bubba gumps) but this was rather tasteful.  There's a giant face of the dude on the front of the restaurant, and the menu mostly consists of burgers, hot dogs, and an entire section dedicated to White Russians.  We had a party of 8 and almost everyone ordered a White Russian and loved it.  My boyfriend was espeically entertained by all the variations, from the good ol' Dude to the Donny, the Jesus, the Big Lebowski, and the Nihilist.  I can see though, if you've never watched the movie this would be completely lost on you.  The bartenders were also really sensitive to food alterations as my boyfriend couldn't eat burger buns so they gave him a giant heap of pulled pork!  There was consensus amongst our group that the Karl Hungus was the best White Russian, with vodka and creme de Banana, whipped cream, chocolate sauce, and two foamy bananas added in for good measure... basically drinking a banana split.  Even my friends who don't like alcohol too much succumbed and got this drink because it looked so fun!  We also tried the Brandt, and the Stranger, and all of them were delicious!  It is definitely a fun, extremely American bar.  This must not exist in the States for some legal reasons.  The only partly strange attribute was the music playing on the side.  It looks like there's an area for a DJ and possible dancing (maybe later on in the night) which was quite strange as most bars and pubs in the UK usually don't have music playing and are more geared towards conversations and socialising.  All in all, even though I hate the movie I was quite impressed with this bar!  It's really modern, open, and spacious, and seems about as american as it can get in the UK.  It's a good place to hang out and chill with friends, and is pretty different from your typical Grassmarket or Rose street pub!",

I went on a Friday night and was told that the kitchen closed at least an hour ago (even though it was still pretty early in the night and I literally saw someone else successfully order good not even five minutes before). Even though we were beyond hungry we decided to stay for a couple drinks because the White Russians looked too good to pass up. I tried The Toe and The Donny and my god they were delicious. I personally prefer drinks where you can't really taste the alcohol and these tasted like candy. I was pretty disappointed about not being able to try the food but the drinks were great.",

    "text": "Recently visited Lebowskis on a Friday night for some pub grub, I'd visited once before for drinks but this was my first time trying the nosh.  We had pre-booked a table in the \"restaurant\" and I'm glad I did!  At 7.30pm the bar was already crammed with weekend drinkers hovering round our table, hoping we'd be a 'no-show' so they could nab our seat.  It was pretty busy, with most people standing and drinking the weekend away.  I should have realised it would be busy on a Friday, but I didn't expect it to be quite so noisey.  .  Still glad to have a booth seat in the corner I ordered a chicken burger with homemade wedges and a Peroni beer.  It came on these wee wooden bread boards, I've noticed its the new way these pretentious bars seem to like to serve their burgers these days.  While it looks nice, it's not very practical and leaves little room to cut up your burger, if you are one to cut?  Taste wise, it was braw!  Braw pub grub - just what I wanted, with a light sweet beer to wash it down with... nice.   The general interior design looks ok, standard modern bar design, nothing to write home about.  Although I would say they could dim the lights a little, had one glaring in my eye so bad, I had to move seats.    I would come back again for food, but not on a weekend night, leave it to the drinkers - they want your seat more!",

    "text": "I have to come right out and say that I didn't make the connection between the Big Lebowski and Lebowskis, until I told Jenny L that I didn't think this place looked like it would make cocktails, and she explained that its shtick is supposed to be White Russians.  Oh, right, well then.    So, we hunted down a cocktail list and got to deciding.  We were both a bit put off by the whole milk with cream aspect to the White Russians so for our first round, Jenny ordered an Old Fashioned and I had a Kentucky Julep.  I literally had all three bartenders making my drinks, and while the one who made the Old Fashioned seemed to know what she was doing (despite informing me that it's the staff's least favourite drink to make) the other two were looking at the menu to see what went into the Julep.  Staff having to look at a menu to make your drink does not ellicit much faith in the quality of said drink.  I enjoyed my Julep but did feel like I'd just gotten a mojito made with burbon instead of rum.  Jenny the conisseur informed me that this was NOT how the drink should have tasted.  The whole cocktail ordering experience left me feeling a bit awkward because despite the White Russian shtick, I got the strong impression that the staff really hated making cocktails and I really just felt a bit like a dip, ordering cocktails in what is essentially a pub.    So, all in all we had an enjoyable evening, but that was more down to the company than the atmosphere.  The drinks tasted nice but were made with such a grudge that I really wouldn't be keen to go there for cocktails again.  I would probably pass it by for pints as well because at the end of the day I'm an old person and it was a bit too loud and lacking a bit of character for my taste.",

I've been to it's sister branch in Glasgow a good few times and got dragged to the one in Edinburgh recently too. It's not that bad, of course I just don't find it all that original as I've found \"Lebowski\" style bars in Dresden, Berlin and Prague to so it's kind of just boring now.  They literally have like 20 different white russians with different vodkas, kahluas/chocolate syrups and milk. I used to love white russians but I got sick of them a few years ago and it was a combination of drinking too many and getting a bad round of them one night with out of date cream. Ew.  The decor is quite nice with leather booths and funky lampshades on the ceiling but it doesn't have as much atmosphere as I would like it to have plus I can't get over the annoying Lebowski thing.   I guess, for people who like the film and white russians then this place is ace, but for me. No thanks dudes.",

My old haunt in town was The Old Fire Station (before it went to pot), and I have been known to frequent both Jekyll & Hyde as well as Frankensteins - one significant reason being you can get a reasonably priced frou frou cocktail/drink and a seat on something leather.   Lebowski's definitely had me running for the entrance being a sad little stalker fan of the Coen brothers. I had to have a white russian - oh yes, for the whole empty experience of being in an american film theme pub based on a stoner with a urine-sodden rug. Yes, thankfully, the theme-driven side of the bar is very much muted. It wasn't particularly busy the evening we visited, so were able to overtake a booth.   Lebowskis - a pleasant place to pass an evening but a little hard to draw out from a crowd.",

    "text": "I really don't want to have to do this because I've had such amazing experiences at Lebowskis before. But if this had been my first visit I would never be going back. Went for a Saturday night dinner and drinks treat and expected a lot better. I'd have the meat platter before and was craving it so was disappointed when it was no longer on the menu. When I asked the waitress about it I was reassured they still did it, it just wasn't printed on the menu. I happily handed over my money and sat back in anticipation. But what turned up was worse that dreadful. 4 slices of what i can only assume was Salisbury's bread along with a bundle of salmon, a bowl of haggis, bowl of black pudding and the worst over cooked steak I've ever attempted to eat. And that was all. What happened to the salad, the oatcakes, the chicken, the cooking skills??!! Eventually after prompting, the waitress brought me some cutlery and a few slices of lemon from the bar.  I don't know what was going on in Lebowskis on Saturday but it was all dreadful. Our table was filthy, as was the one in the next booth. And no one came to clear our table long after we finished eating.  I would have been irritated if I'd been told the platter was no longer available but at least that would have been honest. Instead I was fooled into buying a substandard meal.  I think Lebowskis need to make up there minds about what they are offering as there customer experience. At the amazing yelp elite event not even a month ago they were all about gourmet, locally sourced food. Cooked to perfection and served in style. That all went out the window on Saturday.  Will i go back, maybe. Should you go......? That's up to you.",

The staff are pretty fast and personable.  I believe most nights they have live music - really fun on Fridays. Lewbowski's as a bar and as a night out is pretty fun.  I'd definitely recommend this place at the beginning of a night out!  Now on to the foooooood - -   I love the burgers here. I've been here multiple times paying full price or when I've had the It Is On Edinburgh vouchers. The last time I was here I had the fish burger (\"What she order, fish fillet?\" - another Kanye line) and it was miles better than any other fish burger I've had.  It wasn't soaking in oil!! One of my friends had the veggie burger which had grilled vegges, mushrooms and goats cheese. I had a bite and it was pretty tasty.  On another visit, I was in a big blackpudding mood so I chose the pork belly and blackpudding with mash.  It was delicious. I can be picky with my blackpudding and i'll confirm they used the 'good' brand!  This is one of my favourite bars and comfort food eateries.  Check it out!",

I tried the Bunny (rose vodka, black raspberry liquor, topped with whipped cream and - oh yes - pink sprinkles, tasted like a milkshake in a martini glass), the Police Chief (a White Russian with spiced rum instead of vodka, yum) and the Toe (mint choc chip, om nom) and was quite satisfied.   The Carnivore Platter floated by us, only to be cruelly whisked away, but we got to take a good gander at it and it looked amazingly delicious.

The blue cheese salad was good, but bacon wasn't actually crispy.  Overall 4 stars.  Happy we went but we won't be returning.",

We originally had a table booked for 7pm but somehow the group before us were late and we got our table late at nearly 8pm after reminding the staff twice.  But can't really blame them as it was Friday and there were lots of people.  At one point there was beggar cum drunkard who came in and was not served.  He hurled some funky words at the bar staff but left after.  Part and parcel of a great Friday night out.  However that said, I thought the burger was the best I have ever eaten in Edinburgh and I usually don't eat burgers myself.  Big, juice & tender meat and not overpriced.  The only decent place I have burger in Edinburgh is Holyrood 9A but the burgers in Lebowski is much better than the burgers in Holyrood 9A.  The atmosphere here is average and the DJ was playing 90s music last night which was great as it brings back memories.",

Maybe it's because it was Big Lebowski influenced, which happens to be one of my favorite movies, but that is neither here nor there.  The overall vibe here is rustic and has a relatively young crowd.  If this bar was in NYC, it would most certainly be in the East Village / Lower East Side / ABC City area of the city.  The drink menu was entertaining - I liked how they had several kinds of White Russians and they all had themed names.  Very cute.  The food servings were ENORMOUS.  My boyfriend ordered a BLT, which came without a top - but it didn't need it because the sandwich was that enormous.  I ordered 6 chicken wings, thinking I would get 6 wings, but I really received 12 when I split them in half.... and America somehow has the bad rap for overfeeding people!   Overall, this place was a win and I would recommend to anyone traveling to Edinburgh for a quick meal and a few drinks.",

My boyfriend and I are huge fans of The Big Lebowski and my boyfriend secretly wishes he was The Dude as he always bangs on about wanting a White Russian (the drink, not a person).   So we had friends visiting on Saturday night and had to head here. Unfortunately due to a horrific dental procedure the previous day, I was unable to drink alcohol so I had to miss out on the White Russians (excuse to return I think). My boyfriend went for The Dude, obviously, and said it was brilliant. Everything he had hoped for apparently! A friend went for The Saddam which he said was good, but his second was The Donny which he enjoyed more. I was truly gutted to miss out on the White Russians as they did look so good! Plus the choice is amazing too, something to suit every taste. Although I would add, maybe a non-alcoholic selection of cocktails would be a good idea. I probably wouldn't have noticed if I had been able to drink, but it would have been good to sample something more exciting than cola.   The food menu looked really interesting too, not really what I would expect from bar food. I think a return visit for some food and White Russians is in order!",

    "text": "Lebowski's is quite a recent and welcome addition to the Edinburgh bar/pub scene. It takes its name from the Coen brother's film 'The Big Lebowski' and those in the know will spot signs of this influence. The bar sells no fewer than nineteen different kinds of white Russian cocktails, all of which take their name from the film, 'The Dude' himself makes an appearance on this list. In addition to the cocktails, they also serve a really lovely cloudy cider on draught. They've put almost as much thought into the food menu as the amusing list of cocktails, everything is fresh and there is a focus on using Scottish produce (Ayrshire ham, smoked Mull cheddar etc). The chunky tats are great to have with a pint if you're feeling peckish, I ordered them expecting a bowl of bland pub chips, but they are actually crispy potato wedges with the skin left on - flavourful and filling.  Lebowskis is a good place to go for a bite to eat before catching a film at the Cameo or a show at the Usher Hall or Lyceum.",

I loved the texture of the Chili and the tastiness of it without it being overly spicey or spiced. I also loved the fresh twist on the pico de gallo and grated cheese adorning my wee chili cup. They were quite smart at this place and offered some kind of lime margarita side drink with their chili which i actually just poured into my chili making it really yummy (I do realise it sounds gross but it was actually very good.)   The atmosphere was rockin and the DJ was cool. I will have to come back again and try their normal menu for sure.",

    "text": "Hmmm, not this is an interesting review... I can't see myself coming here on a busy weekend evening, but I still feel compelled to give it four stars based on my Sunday experience.   Essentially some friends and I stopped in here for a drink after leaving Mum's for lunch as it's on the way home and a friend of mine likes the whole Lebowski theme, although I can't say it does much for me.  Initially I tried one of their speciality cocktails for the moment, a Frangelico Sour, which... I just have to say, yum... it tasted like the winter version of an amoretto sour and really worked in my opinion.  I had actually assumed there weren't many drinks I could try here due to a blasted intolerance of lactose, but upon having a friend query them I was given the glorious news that they have lacto free milk which in turn opened up the drink menu to a far further potential.   Speaking of the drinks, this place features heavily on White Russians... even if they aren't your thing it's probably worth trying one of the more creative varieties, there's surely something that would hit the spot.  Beyond that a friend of mine ordered an Old Fashioned, and on this instance at least it was made with the proper care and attention which was appreciated.  They also do a selection of bottled beers, with a few creative options, and draft beers that were unfortunately far less creative but suitable.  (Think Estrella, Staropramen, etc.)   There were only a few people in here at the time, post lunch on a Sunday, but the staff were quite happy for use to literally lounge in one of the restaurant booths casually drinking throughout the afternoon... what was supposed to be stopping in for one on the way home ended up being a few hours of banter and drinks, to the point where we ordered some sliders succumbing to hunger down the line.  Now here was the real surprise... the chicken sliders and slider burgers were soooo good! (With a side of buffalo sauce for the chicken sliders, naturally.)  I can absolutely see myself in here ordering these again on a day that isn't so busy... the only downside being that they can only be ordered in groups of three, i.e. if a group of you wanted three chicken and three burger sliders you have to order two sets of three rather than a cheaper order of six split down the middle, etc.  They did let us upgrade the included tats to \"devil's\" tats however, which was appreciated.  (We also tried an order of the chilli cheese sliders, which were fine and definitely as advertised, but I wouldn't order these over the chicken or burger sliders personally.)   The service on this instance was also spot on, not invasive but just the right level of attentive... I'm not sure how it would be if it were extremely busy, but on this instance there were no complaints for the service department.  (Extra points for them charging my friend's phone behind the bar; most bars tend to do this, but it's appreciated all the same.)   I actually like the layout of the place, \"dude\" stuff aside... personally I just tell myself it's a regular bar and ignore the Lebowski references, but if that's your thing I suppose it doesn't hurt.  The only real downside to me in regards to the building itself was the restroom... it looked like it had seen better days and didn't match the apparent cleanliness of the rest of the bar/restaurant.   I can definitely see why this place would be too much for some, and again I can't see myself pushing my way in here on a busy evening (I've seen it heaving at times), but come another lazy weekend afternoon I think I could have done far worse this time around... so, with that in mind, I'm throwing them a four star bone for now... I'm sure I'll be back once or twice over the course of the year so I will update accordingly based on further experiences.",

The warm furnishings include plush leather seats, dark wood, and sandstone (I think) blocks for some of the pillars and walls.  Pass-through areas in the walls allow airflow and light throughout the restaurant.  The food's good and straightforward; plenty of comfort food, with decent sandwich specials at lunch.  There are 25 or so types of White Russians in honor of The Dude and all those he encountered.  Other than the White Russians and the excellent mural on the outside all though, there're little direct ties to The Big Lebowski . . . not even a classic rug.  Ah well -- I'd still return.",

    "text": "I have been a big fan of Lebowskis since it opened in Edinburgh and is one of my go to pubs for anything from a quick lunch to a night out.  There are lots of things this place got right, but it all centers on the atmosphere which is fun, easy going and laid back, just like its namesake.    They usually have good tunes on the background, and quite often have live music in the evening which has always been enjoyable! The 2 things they are best known for are their food and their White Russian menu.   If you are a fan of White Russians, you are going to be pretty happy here as i would bet there is nowhere else in Edinburgh with such an extensive menu and all those I have tried have been great!  The food here has long been a favourite of mine with a great range of gastrenomic delights, however I have to say that I feel this is slipping as of late.  I believe there have been a few changes in the kitchen recently, and the menu has undergone quite a few changes too with some of the favorites disappearing.  The last time I ate there was a week ago and we were all left quite underwhelmed, but I as I have had so many positive experiences I am willing to put it down as a bad day in the hope it will be back up to scratch next time I go (and there will be a next time, very soon!) in which case they will get the full 5 stars.",

You walk in the door, BAM, you're in the bar line. And drunken peeps do not want to let people through. Straight up, first impression is tainted.  Second gripe is the live music. I've been a few times and the music often feels completely out of touch with the venue. Also, when the bar is busy it feels like the musician is playing in the middle of the line for the bar. Which is also where the front door is. And there is so much space out the back!  Final gripe: The full potential of the Lebowski theme is unrealized. Yep, the white russians are pretty good but more should be done than just painting murals of Jeff Bridges and John Goodman. Bowling paraphernalia, a rug, more inspiring uniforms etc. I love The Big Lebowski and I know the owner does too. If the theme was pushed in a more Lebowski-esque manner, ALL my pound-sterling-dubloons would be thrown unconditionally at this bar. Until then, I label this place 'a probably worth seeing once' kinda place.",

However, if you're not a fan of the drink, then Lebowskis becomes just a normal bar. I got the Walter, which is essentially a chocolate chocolate white russian and my friend got the Brandt. The drink was EXACTLY what I wanted and they're all reasonably priced.  Service (3/5) - Service was speedy and average.   Ambiance (4/5) - Tavern like ambiance.

As we walked in we soon realised that it's a popular place with the locals and lots of the tables were reserved. That was fine with us though, as we propped the bar up, and was served quickly with White Russian after White Russian.  I'll have to hold my hands up here, and say I was slightly tiddly after a few of these delicious cocktails so can't actually remember the names of them... However, the one with chocolate milk in it was my favourite (whichever one that was).   The cocktails were also reasonably priced and after having 3 w.r. each, I didn't actually leave in debt, which is always a nice surprise the morning after.   The bar also had a great live singer on the Saturday night we visited, which gave a great atmosphere to an already busy pub.  I now have to watch the film, so I can laugh along with my boyfriend to the menu.",

If you love the classic White Russian, you're going to love Lebowski's inventive menu; they've over ten White Russians and two Black Russians to choose from. And a daily special White Russian too. (When I visited the special was salted caramel, mmmmm!) - If you're a White Russian lover, this will be heaven for you!  This was my first experience of the bar and I've no real complaints other than when last orders time came, the staff wanted us out of there and fast. I'm used to the traditional 'drink up!' and then fifteen or twenty minutes to do so. It struck 1am and in a matter of minutes I heard a member of staff tell another party that they had ninety minutes to drink up or they'd be chucked out. If the bar staff serve drinks at a time where they know they'll have be rushed minutes later, then I'd say it's wrong of them to do so. I wasn't in that position but I'd have no idea that 'drink up' meant having to be out in minutes at Lebowski's.   Anyway, that's a grumble. Lebowski's was a pleasant one last stop before home.   Kahlua, vodka, milk, cream, ice, cocoa, crushed coffee beans = heaven! And Lebowski's do it very well!",

Basic jist, it's a white russian bar with a dozen or so variants, plus all the usual bar fair. They've a good rep for their food, and I've enjoyed it in the past, so when a meetup at a different bar got bounced because red squirrel was rammed I was very happy to come to lebowskis instead.  It was busy too, but the lovely lady serving us said there'd be a table clear in a few minutes and invited us to grab a drink at the bar while we waited. True to her word, 5 minutes or so later the table was available, friends arrived, and we hungrily read the menu.  The waitress took our orders, 3 burgers and one of the seasonal specials, job done. If only...  Firstly, all the burgers arrived with chips instead of wedges. \"oh we've run out, did no one tell you?\"  Secondly, one friend ordered the falafel burger, and was presented with the mushroom burger instead, which earlier she had said she'd had before and wasn't that into it.  Thirdly, and most irritatingly, my girlfriend's food just didn't arrive. We asked for it twice before it finally showed up well after the rest of us had finished our food.   To her credit, the waitress was incredibly apologetic, and we saw her apologizing to a lot of other customers. It would appear that the kitchen were having an absolute howler. Ah well, no harm done.  BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!  So after the food debacle we were straight up abandoned by both of the staff who'd been serving us. We had to go find someone to get the bill (long lost seasonal deducted of course) only to find somehow they'd ended up charging me 13 instead of 1 for the extra halloumi I'd ordered so we had to wait at the bar to challenge the miss charge!  All in all a very poor night for lebowskis. Plus points the music wasn't too loud and apparently they've stopped doing the god awful live music they had on here. Get it together lebowskis, I want to be able to keep recommending you guys.",

The entire pub is decked with posters and references to the big lebowski, the menu has an endless array of lebowski themed cocktails and plates, and the bartenders were very pleasant and cheeky. Favorite part was a shelf lined with kahlua in the back of the bar. Found out it was relatively empty due to time of day and recent opening, they get most business in later hours or during their many themed events throughout the week.  We had a great time, got free complimentary shots form the bar, and left very happy. Highly recommend this place!",

I had no idea there could be so many possible ways to make them. There is probably 15-30 different ways they have them listed. It will forever change your way and your idea how to spice up a classic cocktail.   I had two. :)",

We had a leaving do in here, and at the last minute a colleague in a wheelchair arrived. We panicked as Lebowski's has steps outside and isn't accessible, not a problem for the staff who picked up the wheelchair and lifted him in. This going above and beyond the call of duty or customer service has really made it stand out for me and I can't recommend it enough.",

There's a great \"stoop\" outside where you can all sit and watch the world go by when we get our 5 days of sun a year, and the inside is nice and cosy for the other 360 days too!  Great selection of beers, always something new to try. And they do an epic White Russian, which isn't usually my bag, but highly recommended!",

As an update, am back on Tuesday and this time, they are out of Sainsbury's tomato juice; Sainsbury's is LITERALLY just across the street. I don't understand this place. I will not be back.",

The food is typical bar food but a tad better. The french fries got hard after 10-15 minutes and were difficult to eat.  We only ate there due to time constraints.  Highly recommend to just go for the white russians, eat if you must.",

Lebowskis has an insane selection of White Russians which would keep anyone busy. This is in-keeping with slightly nuanced 'The Big Lebowski' theme.   I used to frequent here...eh..frequently, when I lived off Lothian road but now I'm a Leither I don't really get the chance. The quality of the food has dropped a bit. We didn't finish anything we ordered (burgers and hotdogs) because it just seemed dry and bland. The service was slow, despite the fact there was max 10 patrons other than ourselves.  I ate here two (ish) years ago and have a vague memory of a steak and cheese sandwich that left all full and happy. Unfortunately we couldn't replicate the experience this time around.",

    "text": "While the movie, \"The Big Lebowski\" is a cult favorite, this bar really has nothing to do with it other than a pic on the wall and a list of about 27 different kinds of white Russians.  So if it's a theme bar you are looking for- you are not going to find it here.  What you will find is a packed house (standing room only on the the night I was there) friendly locals mixing with a number of tourists, and pleasant and helpful serving staff that are quick to take good care of you.  If you sit on the  bar side- know that you will need to do your own ordering at the bar but they will bring the food out to you.  If you are lucky enough to get one of the tables on the restaurant side (just walk around and find an empty one) you will have table service.  Beer is cold and they have about 8 on draft although nothing that I would say stands out.  The menu is pretty much a bar food menu with choices from some entrees to burgers to wings to fish and chips.  I chose the latter and it was okay.  One piece of juicy fried fish with potato wedges for 10.00 which was pricey in my book (but what the heck-everything is pricey here).  Dinner for two with a couple of beers came to 25 pounds which in US dollars is close to $50!  If you are in the area and want a cold one- I'd say stop in.  But I wouldn't make it a destination.  Unless you are looking for a White Russian!",

I haven't counted how many they have on the menu, but I'd guess at around 40. Wish you could have one with chocolate milk, with bourbon, with cherries, or even with Buckfast? You'll find them all on the menu. It's impossible to choose, as they all sound completely delicious, but I guess it's a good excuse to return and gradually make your way through the list!  And food wise, Lebowskis does a mean burger. Not the very best in Edinburgh, but a worthy contender, these are big meaty hunks in brioche buns, with a variety of toppings to choose from, not to mention chicken, veggie and fish options. Or dare you try the Big Lebowski - a double burger (I believe there's also a double sized White Russian of the same name).  So for when nothing will hit the spot quite like meat and milk, make it a Lebowskis night. The Dude would approve.",

As a fan of both the film and white Russians I take to this place. After a Saturday afternoon visit to the Picturehouse my friend and I decided a trip here was in order.  We promptly ordered white Russians and looked over the food menu. I went for the whale burger and my pal asked for a hot dog. First issue was there were no hot dog buns, slightly surprised by this oversight this early on a Saturday night.  My whale burger was ok, the beer battered coley was tasty enough, the bun was rather dry and crumbly and the zingy tartar sauce in the description was nowhere to be found. Chips were ok but not great.  The real issue here was the service, definitely got the feeling the waitress didn't care for customers who weren't 'alternative', in other words if you didn't wear black and have a piercing hanging from every available crook of skin. She was lazy, rather than checking/serving customers she stood by the pass on her mobile while she was meant to be getting our bill.  Good bar, good drinks, ok food and some rather unpleasant/incompitent waitresses.",

Also, hats off to the chef, because after I mentioned the Thai mussels that were served at the elite event the chef made some up for me. Even though it wasn't on the menu!! Not many chefs do that! They were amazing as well, and had a kick. I will be trying to re-create them this Christmas.   ALSO, really great special was on that night for macaroni and cheese. Was three pound something, and it was individually cooked with breadcrumbs on top. It was such a cheap meal and really good mac and cheese.   Cheap and Cheerful!!",

I'm struggling with the volume of music to hear the conversation, hence there must be a speaker blasting out the tunes. Good tunes at that too. So can't complain too much.
