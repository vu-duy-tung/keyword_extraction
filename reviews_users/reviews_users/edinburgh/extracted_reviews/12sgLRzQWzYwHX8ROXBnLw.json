    "text": "All we did here was eat so I can't pass comment on the drinks list but, given the main course portion sizes, it would have been hard to fit some wine in anyway.  The wood pigeon breast we both started with was as good as you would hope for & on a par with anywhere else I've had it recently. For those filling mains I opted for the saddle of rabbit which provided two healthy, meaty portions along with great wild vegetable dauphinoise (a plate of which would be great just on its own) and crisp parsnip strips to sweeten things up a bit.  My companion opted for the pithivier accompanied by sugar snap peas with cashew nuts and that was pronounced a success as well although ultimately its size was defeating. We did though manage to share a brownie with ice cream & hot fudge sauce (which wasn't as hot as expected). Either way we were unexpectedly stuffed.  Service throughout was friendly and informative with all tables seemingly treated with equal importance, as it should be. When booking though try to secure a window table as they afford a little more cosiness.",

    "text": "Such a sweet little jewel box of a restaurant. Maybe not quite 5 Stars compared to Aizle, Martin Wish art and the other usual suspects in town, but beautifully prepared dishes with lovely service and a thoughtful wine list.   Initially The Rabbit Hole had more of an Italian inflection to the food but it seems to have shifted more towards French. Either way, well done.   Very high quality, fresh and well prepared seafood. I've had delicately cooked scallops, a smoked haddock Scotch egg with a perfectly oozy center...and those were just starters!   Some outstanding wild game and more unusual meats such as quail and squab. I had what was probably some of the best calves liver I've ever enjoyed. If you're a meat lover, this is a great stop. Also several good selections for vegetarians.   If you're in the area for lunch, The Rabbit Hole also offers a creative and well priced lunch set menu. It'll offer familiar favorites like steak frites, but also some of the more creative a la carte items. Including desserts!  Prices are a little high compared to some other restaurants in the area, but portions are generous and most importantly the food quality is worth it.   With such a small space and patrons enjoying relaxing, lingering meals, I'd have to speculate no one here is getting rich and the head chef genuinely loves his work.  The food is mostly quite rich, hearty and filling. Although there are a few lovely lighter options like a beautiful fish cooked en papillote (wrapped in parchment then oven roasted) with veg.   Great option for a romantic dinner or out with friends. They even have a wee children's menu, though I have yet to see any children there.   Give it a go on your next special night out, or just try popping by if you're in the neighbourhood!",

    "text": "This Italian inspired restaurant opened recently in Marchmont after Sweet Melinda's moved out. The space has been revamped and now has a bar and seems a lot cozier. I swear every time I've walked by this place recently it has been absolutely jam packed too, which is a good sign.   Headed here on a Thursday night after yoga with fellow Yelper Mariana and we had a great meal. Service was very attentive and friendly but not overbearing. We shared a seared scallop and curried cauliflower starter which was divine. For my main I had the seabream with mushrooms which was also perfectly done. We finished off the night sharing a brownie with ice cream and also a nice dram. The server informed us the chef is from Italy and really enjoys sourcing local ingredients and that definitely showed. Overall a 5 star experience from service to quality to ambiance at this great little bistro in Marchmont, where there is not a large selection for dinner options. Will definitely return.",

    "text": "We went for an early pre-Fringe dinner with friends visiting from London. The menu offered a good range of tantalising options to please us all. We elected to start with a round of cocktails, shared some starters which then led to individual mains with a selection of sides to share. I could not fault any of our dishes, they were all beautiful. Special thanks to the charismatic manager who was particularly helpful and made for an excellent dining experience. We shall return!",
