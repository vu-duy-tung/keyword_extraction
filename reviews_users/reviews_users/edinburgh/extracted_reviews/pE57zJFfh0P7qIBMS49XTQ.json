The cats were pretty sleepy but still so fluffy and cute. We got an hour for 8 plus I ordered a latte. The drinks were surprisingly good! They did serve the cats some food during the hour so some became a bit more active. Maybe a few too many people during the hour for my liking, but I would come back again. No smells also which is important!",

I love visiting cat cafes in every new city that I visit, so I was actually surprised at myself for not thinking of looking to see if Edinburgh had one. Anyway, it found me, so all was well.  Definitely pre-book ahead of time; while Maison de Moggy does take walk ins, it's only if they are available and I think they're pretty popular, so you're better of pre-booking so you don't get turned away because the slots are all full.  My appointment was at 3pm and the cats were mostly awake. Keep in mind that cats sleep 16 hours per day and this cafe is their home, so they are not there to perform tricks or play on demand. This is meant to be a place where you can relax and interact with them and have some delicious cakes and drinks, but if the cats are just sleeping or otherwise chilling, don't be disappointed. It's just what cats do.  All of the cats were beautiful and you can tell they are well-loved! The staff and owner were super friendly and fun to talk to, and I loved learning about all of the cats' personalities. I especially loved Elodie, the hairless Sphynx, who was an adorable little trouble maker and very energetic!  This cat cafe is lovely and there is plenty of room for the cats and the people visiting to spread out. There are lots of seats and tables, and I highly recommend getting a slice of cake. I tried the raspberry white chocolate and it was divine! They also have coffees and teas.  If I am ever back in Edinburgh I will be booking another appointment at Maison de Moggy right away! I loved all of the cats and this was a really great experience while I was away from my own pets at home.",

Maison de Moggy has a dozen or so cats in a nice spacious establishment. All the cats are owned by the same person and they're well socialized with each other and with humans. It's clear they're well cared for and given plenty of love!  Of course cats aren't obligated to love you and some can be skittish, but that's the charm of a cat cafe! You get to experience all their personalities at once. I loved Guillaume, he has such an expressive little face!  A tip: It's very important to make a booking beforehand (it's easy to do on their website) as it seems to fill up quite fast so walk-ins can't often get in.",

I booked online to make sure I got in, there are house rules that you must abide to and one is that you need to remove your shoes before stepping  through to where the cats are. Then you are free to roam just as the cats do or grab a table or sit down somewhere, order a tea and cake which is prepared in a cat free zone, when I was there the cats didn't really come up to me or try to sit on my lap or anything, even when I had food, it was like they are so used to people, were boring to them now, the humans had to seek them out rather than them seek us out. It's a lovely place, just like visiting someone's house, it's cosy with couches, coffee tables and cats play things and personal touches of photographs of the cats and information on the walls of the cats names and their personalities. The cat nanny was lovely, given us lots of information about the cats, she was so friendly and you can tell she adores the cats, they are so loved and so well taken care of, I loved my visit and highly recommend, I will be visiting again but until then I'll give a wave through the window to Sebastian, coco, Fabian, Amelie, Alain, Marcel, philippe, Pierre, Elodie and the many more.",

The animals are clearly taken care of very well which should be the first concern of a customer who cares about animal welfare. All of the cats were friendly but definitely used to humans so some weren't as receptive to human attention but they were all sweet and a few were very playful. The women managing the cafe were friendly and informative and attentive to the humans and animals without making it awkward. The cafe was also very clean and well kept; you would never expect that 12 animals lived there. I would definitely return to this cafe.",

    "text": "As a self confessed crazy-cat-lady, with a crazy-cat-lady-boyfriend, it seemed obligatory to visit this place as soon as we moved to Edinburgh.  As others have stated, it's very important that you book prior to visiting- whilst we were there, lots of walk-ins knocked on the door to see if they could come inside... They couldn't.   We were told the rules: *No picking up the cats *Take off your shoes (top tip: don't wear holey socks) *Try not to disturb sleeping cats *And no, you can't take them home (dammit)  And then were left to try and find the many cats, that were dotted all over the place. We even missed one little kitty because she was all curled up in a little basket on the ceiling!   First off, they are all amazing! There's different breeds, different colours, sizes and lots of different personalities! They are all very well looked after, and I felt quite jealous that I couldn't stay there forever, being adored and fed every day.   The absolutely best bit of our experience, is ordering cake. Now, I'm not a sphinx cat fan, they actually freak me out a bit... But my goodness, that cat is absolutely hilarious. I was physically crying with laughter when my boyfriend tried to eat his cake. The little hairless ninja is so fast, and IT WILL STEAL YOUR CAKE!   The only reason why I've not given this place the full 5 stars is because 7 each for entry, and 8 for our coffees and cakes I think is slightly pricey. It resulted in an hour of our day costing 22 which is a bit much.   But you know what, that little cafe looks after their cats so well, and they participate in lots of cat charity stuff, that I'd pay it again! Just to see that cake-stealing-hairless-cat again!   Not quite purrfect, but certainly the cat's whiskers!",

    "text": "I'm going to be honest: I was all set up to dislike Maison de Moggy.   Having been to a few cat cafes previously, they are often mismanaged, chaotic spots where the cats don't have enough space to get away when they don't want to be pet. Having three furballs at home, I couldn't imagine them stuck in a place where they didn't have their alone time or one where they might bicker with their co-cats (new word?), so I arrived, all ready to complain...  What I found was pleasantly surprising. Maison de Moggy knows their stuff and the staff DEEPLY care about the wellbeing of the cats. There is plenty of space for them to roam but equal amounts of nooks and crannies to tuck into when they don't want to be the centre of attention. In fact, the hidey holes are so well constructed, that I asked for the name of the folks who built them: VERY cute construction inside! It was also great to note that most of the cats were acquired as kittens and grew up together. I've spoken to a few people who turned their nose up at this, wishing instead that they were adoptable cats, but knowing how hard it is to introduce a new cat into a space (heck, my gals go nuts if one of them has been to the vet... let alone adding an entirely new sibling in the mix) - I was glad to hear that there isn't constant turn over.  Plus, the cake and tea were both yummy. So happiness all around.   The entry fee is a bit steep - but after noticing that most of the other folks in the place didn't order food/drink, I suppose I understand that. It would be nice to have a discount if you ARE buying food...  But the True reason for this five star? The ADORABLE, ridiculously hilarious personality that is their hairless cats. Now, I actually don't mind hairless breeds (I know they freak some people out) but I've never met a cat with a bigger personality than Maison de Moggy's little cake stealing cat (whose name I have forgotten!). They warn you when you sit down to guard your cake and I'm not going to give it away (because it's hilarious) but there's a very good reason to the warning.   Definitely a great way to spend an hour!",

    "text": "What a great way to spend a lazy afternoon..  In the company of lovely,  majestic felines!  You have to prebook a time,  which you can do on the website (7pp for a 1h slot) as there's a long lineup of expectant cat lovers itching for their 'cat fix'!    They are quite organised and only let in the group, explaining some house rules to keep the place tidy and safe for the cats. We were impressed at how clean and fit for purpose this place was.. With all. Kinds of places for cats to sleep, play, hide..  Catering to their natural desire to be high,  warm and scratch. There was even a couch scratching post!  We saw 7 cats I believe and many were pedigrees so worth seeing to interact with different breeds.  They're all friendly and sleeping most of the time..  They didn't seem particularly interested in playing with dangly toys but I don't blame them as they're probably inundated with attention!   Cats included a Sphynx Elodie who was wrapped up in a cozy jumper and sitting in her spot near the radiator, a soft ragdolls Alain & Amelie, exquisite half-brothers Norwegian Forest Cats Fabian and Jacques, striking Bengal Siamese brothers named Marcel and Philippe,  and a polydactyl black Main Coon Pauline who really looks like a \"Batman Cat\"!   You can purchase coffee and cake there..  We ordered a coffee and a Japanese Cherry pot of tea - tasted nice and in loose leaf form which I prefer over tea bags. I rated 4 stars instead of 5 because it was quite difficult to get ahold of them over the phone to book or ask questions,  and I think 14 entrance for two people should come with complimentary tea at least! Otherwise, definitely worth a visit for the experience if you're a cat/animal lover!  Just make sure to prebook to avoid disappointment and it might be useful to know that you can't bring you're own cat!",

    "text": "WOW. As a cat-lady-without-a-cat, the concept of a cat cafe is something I've been very much behind since I first heard about them. And this absolutely lived up to my expectations!  You pay 7 for an hour with the fluffies and I really think it's worth it - especially considering the clearly very high level of care the staff take of these cats. They are all clearly well-fed, well looked after, well-groomed and happy kitties!  The cats are different breeds and they are all totally gorgeous, each with their own little quirks and personalities. The staff are really knowledgable about the cats individually which just goes to show how much they really love what they do!   On arrival, you need to take your shoes off and use hand sanitiser which is fair enough, wouldn't want the fluffballs getting anything nasty from outside, especially when they see so many different people every day. You are also briefed on the rules - no picking up the cats, no feeding the cats and no letting them get to your food either (Fabian and Elodie are wee monkeys when it comes to this, so watch out for them particularly!) no annoying them, no waking them up on purpose and generally just be nice to them! All also fair enough as the cats' happiness is so important of course.  I grabbed a slice of cake and a catpuccino (while fending off the aforementioned monkeys) and these were really nice - you get a biiiiig slice of cake which is obviously something I appreciate. But once I'd scarfed these it was back to hanging out with the kitties, watching them scamper about and playing with them!  Overall, it's just a really lovely way to spend an hour if you love cats!",

We were told that we would need to take our shoes off or wear those blue plastic bags over our shoes. I opted to take my shoes off. We also use hygienic soap and we were told not to lift cats or wake cats.  So we wandered around finding cats to stroke or tease with the toys. Then we had drinks and cake. I ordered the Chai Latte and a Brownie. This is when things got really funny. The Sphinx cat is a wee speedy ninja cat in its desperation for cream and cake! I was videoing his skills, and in the process I lost a good chunk of cake! The other cats gathered around our table. But not in the same speed or pace as Sphinx cat!  The hour flew in and we had to leave. I would gladly return in the future!",

(I think my cat might get jealous though)  Seriously, if you like cats go. They are well looked after, chill as all heck, get along and are just so fun and lovely.  Staff are great, cakes are good.   YES to this place!!",

    "text": "Being a cat-lover, it's no surprise that I absolutely loved my trip to Maison de Moggy (doubly-so as it was a birthday gift from my fiance!).  The staff were a lovely combination of friendly and professional, and as a cat owner I was really pleased to see the emphasis placed on the cats' welfare throughout our visit.  We had a chance to see most of the cats, although our hour slot was fully booked and there were times when I felt a little self-conscious stroking a cat with a group of people gathered round waiting their turn.  I tried the chocolate orange cake and salted caramel hot chocolate, both of which were great and the staff were sweet enough to add a little candle to my cake slice after I mentioned it was my birthday.  Overall, a really lovely experience although in future I'd be tempted to go at a quieter time, perhaps early morning mid-week?",

    "text": "I've been a cat lover ever since day dot, but since I moved out of the family home many years ago, I haven't had a cat in the house, so have missed my kitty cuddles.  That's where Maison De Moggy comes in! Perfect for those of us who love cats, but can't practically have one at home.  I got my kitty fix tenfold as there were about 10 cats wandering, playing or snoozing around the custom-made cat cafe. They have oh so many hideyholes, places to sleep, things to climb and toys to play with. Patrons are encouraged to pat and play with the cats, just not pick them up or let them snaffle your cake...Elodie the Sphynx cat, I'm talking to you.  The two ladies working in the cafe were very welcoming and friendly, answering any questions we had about the cats. It is clear the cats are extremely well looked after and are free to do as they please.",
