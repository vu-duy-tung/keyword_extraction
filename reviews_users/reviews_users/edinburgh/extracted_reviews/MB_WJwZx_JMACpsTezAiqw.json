    "text": "Enjoyed a croque monsieur and a good cappucino here one Saturday back in January (I was just slightly too late to get the breakfast menu).  It seems to be a popular haunt for couples with young kids so be warned if that has the potential to ruin your mood or whatever.  Try to get the seat right at the back by the window so you can watch the Water of Leith going by.  The service was good although I initially had to get up to get a copy of the menu myself (had the impression the staff were just enjoying a small amount of quiet before the expected lunchtime rush).",

Extended the hours now into Friday and Saturday evenings providing a really good fresh menu full of local produce and shaped by Mika's French kitchen expertise.  Perfect for cake, brunch or something more.  My favourite is the croque monsieur. Superbly positioned for a walk down the Water of Leith.",
