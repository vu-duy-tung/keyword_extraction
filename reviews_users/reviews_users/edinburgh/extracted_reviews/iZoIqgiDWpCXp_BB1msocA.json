We have the peanut butter crepe and the fruit waffle, quite delicious. It's definitely worth the try. Also it was very convenient for the time of day we went (around 2030).",

It's just crepe was chewy and dry. Winter red tea was very nice with it though. Would not go back though... would try elsewhere...",

Best waffle ever, better than my Belgian waffle experience! The sandwich we had beforehand was also very good and healthy, combatting the large amount of sugar following it. This place is a must try!",
