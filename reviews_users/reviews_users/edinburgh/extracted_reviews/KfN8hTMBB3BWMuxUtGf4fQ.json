    "text": "Have we lived in Europe for so long that our standards for Mexican food have dropped, or is Blue Parrot Cantina actually a good place to eat? I think it's the latter. The menu isn't extensive, but all the staples of a quality tex-mex place are there: burritos, enchiladas, chimichangas, and more. On our most recent visit we started with the black bean soup, which was well-spiced and interesting. I continued with a vegetable chimichanga, which was every bit as good as I remember the chimichangas at our regular Mexican haunt from my stateside childhood. The melted cheese was plentiful, which is exactly how I like it.   The margaritas were tasty but not quite the right consistency - too little time in the blender left them at this awkward stage that was neither frozen nor on the rocks.   Service was fast and friendly, and the food was obviously all prepared fresh in the small, open kitchen. The decor is simple yet appealing, and there's a certain coziness to this low-lit basement dining room.",

    "text": "Wow. Very underwhelming. And I was so looking forward to boasting about having an amazing Mexican restaurant within metres of my home.   Let's get straight to it.   I can't fault the service. They were friendly, helpful and prompt.   Drinks were ok, I didn't care for the wine glasses which were quite small and cheap looking.   Oh and the food. Starters were the guacamole and pico de gallo. Both under seasoned and quite bland. There was nothing exciting about it. Corn chips were also on the less salty side to eat was like eating crunchy and mushy anything.   My main was the beef enchilada. I will say this is very reminiscent of taco bell (US) or taco bill (Australia) which is like tasteless meat wrapped in carbs with a side of mush (refried beans) covered in cheese. There was nothing explosive or enticing about this meal.   I wouldn't go back because I get the gist. It didn't feel exciting or authentic and not really a meal I would want again.",

    "text": "This is one of the most disappointing \"Mexican\" restaurants I've been to.  I'll start with the good:  The margarita appeared little pricey for the size, but it was pretty strong so it felt worth it and it tasted great. The chocolate cake was perfect (we got it warm). It had great texture and flavor and tasted homemade. The service was fast and friendly, and the space was cozy. The steak from the fajitas was seasoned perfectly and was my favorite part of dinner.  Unfortunately, there's also the bad: We ordered two appetizers: nachos and quesadilla. They were both pretty small but we figured maybe they'd be really good. They were just ok. The guac and sour cream sides were tiny, maybe a spoonful, which wouldn't be so bad if they weren't charging almost 2 each for them. The nachos came with them, but man, that's a pretty steep price even for Edinburgh. The quesadillas were also heavily filled with onions, which I hate but my partner loves. Other than that, they were just normal quesadillas. As for the entrees, we got the steak fajitas and taquitos. It was at this point that I realized I definitely should've mentioned that I hate onions, but I completely forgot to say it and figured most places make it pretty easy to just pick them out and it doesn't matter. This, however, is not most places. Not only were there fairly raw onions in the taquitos (which were literally just shredded chicken and onion) but there were onions chopped up and spread on top, onions mixed in with the rice, and onions around the side. My partner's fajitas were more onion than pepper, and again had onions chopped up and mixed in with pretty much every other part of the dish. Now, I realize my not liking onions is not Blue Parrot's fault, but I'm not sure what would've been left of the dish if I had asked for none. Even my partner couldn't stomach my dish because there were SO many onions. He reeked of onions the next day from how many there were. And most of them weren't even cooked- they were raw! I don't know where in this universe they found these \"Mexican\" or \"Tex-mex\" recipes but it certainly wasn't Mexico or Texas. I'm from the US, half Mexican and lived in New Mexico (above Texas) all my life until I moved here. This food was overpriced and bland without the onions, but so onion-y I can't even imagine what it actually tasted like. I know this seems like a weird thing to be obsessed over but I have literally never seen so many onions on one plate. I'm still shocked over it. Definitely won't be back but people seem to love this place so do what you will. If you're looking for authenticity stay away and go to El Cartel instead. If you've been here before or just really love onions like an unhealthy amount then go wild.",

    "text": "The Blue Parrot is a quirky little place in Stockbridge. The chicken and cashew chimichanga I had was extremely good, packed with mountains of succulent chicken. Their soup was tasty, also. Service wasn't quite what it could have been, and their cellar-conversion toilets will divide opinion, but it's well worth a visit.  Overall, we said: \"I was impressed with the Blue Parrot. It served me two good dishes, in quirky surroundings...I'm not the world's biggest fan of Mexican food, not least because over the years I've eaten in some very ropey Mexican places around Edinburgh, but I'd happily head back here the next time I'm feeling the need.\"",

Once you've stepped inside you can understand why the underground location works to it's advantage. It's warm, cosy and very, very welcoming.  Being a wimp when it comes to spicy food it took me a while to find something that wouldn't make me weep, but the food was unpretentious and a delight when it was produced on the table. I would kill for that swordfish again (I don't know why I couldn't just go back and order it... maybe I will!)  Even though it's a Latina themed place, it's in no way tacky which is so refreshing as this is a real rarity.",

Every time I have been always have the chorizo nachos to start know I should really branch out but they are so good, never been disappointed with the main meals and the margaritas are worth the visit on there own but maybe that's just a problem of mine. Small cosy and very friendly could not recommend strongly enough feels like you are round at a mate's house for dinner but they are awesome at Mexican food.",

    "text": "A tucked-away Stockbridge gem that has been on my list of places to try for some months and it still is! How, you may ask, can I be reviewing a restaurant I have yet to try? Well, dear reader, I went there last week for a work christmas party and had a very good time. But I remember very little of the evening. THAT's how good a time I had. A small, cosy, intimate restaurant with a Mexican theme; the staff managed to make a party of 12 seem not only welcome, but a joy to behold (I'm not sure this sentiment was shared by the other diners). The menu is classically Mexican, but the execution is a class above the bog-standard. Nachos, natch; chimichangas, burittos and enchilladas ditto, but all done (reportedly) to perfection. There are also Mexican style steaks and fish for the less conventional. There may be puddings; I can't remember. They do serve cocktails and liquers, for which I hold them entirely responsible.  So, as I said at the outset, I shall return to The Blue Parrot Cantina for a more sedate and considered meal as soon as they let me back in the door.",

As soon as we walked in, we both were excitedthe restaurant actually smelled like Mexican food! It is a small restaurant, so you will need to make a reservation. But, with the space they have, they have made quite a cute little restaurant. The actual food menu is small, but covers the bases for basic Mexican food. The drink menu is quite extensive. As for the food, we started off with chips and guacamole and weren't disappointed. Both of us were thoroughly satisfied with our main courses and the main courses are enough food to fill you up. My one beef is that they serve brown rice instead of Mexican rice, but they do try to redeem that with salsa and it helps. Also, the beans aren't quite the consistency of True refried beens, but it is a good try. All in all, this is the best Mexican food I have had this side of the Atlantic!",
