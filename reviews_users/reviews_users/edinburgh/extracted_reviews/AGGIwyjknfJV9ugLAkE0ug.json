    "text": "I'm a bit of a lunchtime snob, and Lothian Rd is full of dodgy looking sandwich shops where you eye the congealed, mayonnaise type fillings (that clearly come from a cash and & carry) and 'shiny' ham suspiciously... I'd avoided this shop assuming, like previous reviewers, that it was just another one of those place that skimped on fresh ingredients. Boy, was I wrong!!   I've been in several times now and it's one of my favourite lunch time takeaway places. I love the soups (5 varieties available but I'm a lentil soup all the way type of gal!) and salads where you can pick exactly what you want. Everything looks fresh and tasty and they have choices such as mini pickled onions, rocket, hummus, roast chicken, goats cheese, a variety of lettuce etc.. lots of things to make an interesting, healthy & v tasty salad. Yummy!",

    "text": "As i was made the Duchess at lunch time i thought i should probably review Fresh Cut.  This wee sandwich shop on Lothian Road is one of those consistent places that does exactly what it says on the tin. Their menu is pretty big, offering sandwiches, paninis, soup etc. They have about 5 soups on their menu, and unlike other places these soups don't change (good for people who like having their set routine).   Today i had a bacon, brie and cranberry panini and the mushroom soup, both were delicious. There have a decent amount of seating inside which is good for a bit of people watching on Lothian Road.  The staff are pleasant enough and the prices are pretty standard. Not the most exciting review but i would recommend it!",

    "text": "I have to agree with the other reviewer that when you are presented with seven hundred identical looking lunch time, snacky, sandwich places you get kinda sceptical that you'll be able to differentiate your experience between them, as they all merge into one ubiquitous blur.  However Fresh Cut is actually pretty decent. Despite its modest exterior once inside, you get the impression that every other sandwich joint has taken its style from this place, as Fresh Cut just seems to be that bit more professional. The small seating area looks cleaner, smarter, the boards advertising the food look better organised, better presented.   As for the actual food, well yeah it's still a sand which place but it is better than most. The first thing that struck me was the quality of the bread. I had a baguette that used nice tasting wholemeal bread. What a change from the cheap white crap!  Also expect paninis, wraps and baked potatoes as standards, costing around 2-3.50 depending on what you pick and how many fillings you choose to stuff your face with.  Overall, the best of a mediocre bunch.",

    "text": "Edinburgh is a city with a proliferation of sandwich shops and most of them are not very good. Fresh Cut is one of four (yes, four) that sit next to each other on Lothian Road. I'd always given it a wide berth as, from the outside, it just looks like any other bog standard sandwich place selling uninspired food to hoardes of office workers. I went there for some scran today though and was pleasantly surprised. The ciabatta was still warm from the oven and there were lots of lovely fillings to choose from: I ended up going for chorizo, goats cheese, roasted red peppers and tomato chutney. It set me back 3.50, but I was the envy of the office and nicely full for the rest of the afternoon.",

    "text": "This new bar is situated on Lothian Road right next door to the West End Subway. So there's two reasons not to bother going there. There is often trouble at weekends at the nightclubs and on Lothian Road afterwards, so it's not an area i normally frequent. Fresh, however, has tried hard to try something different and is an improvement on other bars in the area. They have a decent food menu and during the week, when the nearby nightclubs aren't so busy, can have an amiable atmosphere. When i was there it was a Wednesday evening and it was enjoyable enough, albeit with the decor of a chain bar where you could be anywhere.",

    "text": "I had lunch here a while ago and while the food was lovely, the place was nearly empty. As a result, the staff were sitting around with nothing to do, which made me feel awkward asking them for something. It's a shame because my meal was great and it's very reasonably priced. The decor is classy too and if there were a few more customers, it would be a great place to hand out. Hopefully business will pick up!",
