    "text": "Myself and my friends ducked into this little place after visiting the castle. While they were out of a few items on the menu, the food that they did prepare was good! Everything is very simple, so don't go in expecting a three course meal, but for the money, it was great!   Also, as we're traveling in a group, it's been a battle trying to pay on separate checks. We were able to easily do so here. That in itself is worth a star!",

Everything tasted quite good and the owner was very friendly. I was very full and would say this place was good for the price.",

    "text": "What a fantastic surprise!  Shona helped me with the menu and was an absolute joy to talk to about Scottish food.  I had the haggis with neeps and tatties and it was all amazing.  She also sent a Scottish pie with me as I was interested in trying that as well.  My family and I were able to sample it that evening (wonderful) and I would also recommend trying that.  I was very fortunate that I went for lunch a bit after 2 in the afternoon in late November, so it was relatively quiet inside, and Shona and I  had great conversation about travelling in the United States as well as cultural differences between the States and Scotland.  Please take my advice and visit this place for a great Scottish meal with great service and conversation!!!",
