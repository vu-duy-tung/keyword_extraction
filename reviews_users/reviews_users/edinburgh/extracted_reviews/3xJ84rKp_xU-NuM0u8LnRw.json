Although I have to say I love the Tomato & Garlic Pizza Bread here....just love it. It's the only thing I really 'go' here for. Other than that it's a quick fix when we're really hungry which means that we never do much tasting when we're in here.   I've had worse, you probably have too",

    "text": "Meh.  For some reason, my man thought I would enjoy this place because I'm an American. Not so much.  Is it authentic? Not really. It's super greasy and the food tastes not-so-fresh. The portions are oversized to the point of being made for people with eating disorders. I didn't find much on the menu that was appealing to me. So I would not say it was made for my palette.   The only thing I really liked was the free bread they bring out at the beginning of the meal. The music played throughout was also kind of cute. Like a 50's diner theme. No one else in the place seemed to notice or care.  All in all, overpriced junk food akin to what you'd get at a Denny's restaurant in the states. In UK lingo that would be the lowest denominator of a chain diner restaurant at a very bloated price tag. I know that most restaurants in the UK are priced for tourists, but I still think they should at least deliver quality to the price tag they're advertising. This one does not.  Oh, this place also refused to allow me to take home any leftovers in any form. Also a UK thing that I am aware is *somewhat* uncommon but it's not illegal and I do not see how hard it is to invest in some takeaway cartons for people to take home leftovers. I asked and then the waitress would only offer to let me take my pasta home in a dirty ice cream tub. Um, no thanks.",

    "text": "For the price, Frankie & Benny's is pretty reasonable. It's one of the many restaurants in the grand Omnicentre, and capitalizes on the fact people will want to eat before/after a movie at Vue cinema!   I'd had two awesome meals at this restaurant, so I'll be a little more generous than my fellow reviewers! If it's still on the menu (as these days annoying change sometimes...) the Californian pizza is fantastic; pesto, mozzarella, and cherry tomatoes, seems to be my favourite sandwich morphed into a delicious pizza. Their waffles, which I've had for dessert, are also delicious!    Aside from mains, they also have a pretty impressive breakfast menu that I'm eager to try!",

Overall, we said: \"Frankie and Benny's was pretty good.  Their soup pleased me, muchly.  Their pasta dish was less good, but their espresso ended things on a better note.  For large group dining, it offers a perfectly pleasant experience, and dishes that are likely to make diners smile.  I think that's what they're aiming for, so should be commended for accurately delivering it\"",

American grub may not be haute cuisine but there is a place for ribs, barbecue chicken and huge burgers in anyone's diet.  Frankie and Bennie's is the poor relation to these chains, with a barely noticeable Italian influence added. I'll keep this brief: A burger is about a tenner, isn't as good as McDonalds, and you get a shockingly meagre portion of fries.  Not worth the bother.",

    "text": "Frankie and Bennys in the Omni is typical of the restaurants you find in the centre. If you're looking for a meal that will cater to all tastes and is cheap and cheerful then this is a good place to start.   The menu is based loosely around an Italian-American theme with the ususal burgers, pizzas, sandwiches etc. Portion sizes are generally on the large side, so you never go away hungry.   Service can be a little on the slow side, but that's normally because it's always very busy. In general i find the waiting staff to be fairly helpful and friendly and if you let them know you're in a hurry, they will try and speed up yout order.   One of the main reasons I go to Frankie and Bennys is there terrifc value lunch menu. For 7.25 you get two courses that are enough to fill you up for the whole day. With starters like potato skins, garlic pizza bread and chicken strips and mains like pizza (full size), burgers and club sandwiches",

Also there was hardly any cheese at all, it was shocking!! My boyfriend got the Scottish Breakfast and asked for no egg it came with a runny fried egg on the plate!   Also, the service can be very slow here which added to our disappointment.",

The food was lovely, most of us opted for steak and it was cooked very well, as was the lamb shank my sister got.   The restaurant itself is family friendly and they play really nice old 50s music that goes well with the overall Italian / American diner theme they have going on.   The only downside to our meal was how long the service took. Knowing we were going to a show we allowed plenty of time (2 hours) before the show was to start. However we were still rushing to finish our main meals in time, purely because of how long it took us to get served.   I would certainly go back to Frankie and Bennys because the food was lovely, however only if I had nothing else planned that day!",

Unfortunately, my fellow diner didn't enjoy his pancake desert and I wouldn't order the spicy onion rings again. They tasted too processed and chewy. It became busy because of the Monday Madness menu but I found it was a huge effort to get our waiter's attention the whole time we were there, especially when getting deserts and even when we tried to ask for the bill. We had to walk to the front desk to ask if we could leave (the film we were seeing was about the start!)",

Once seated we had ordered drinks and when the waiter returned with them I asked him if they no longer done a meal that I had ordered in the past (admittedly some time ago). He informed me that he had worked there for 11 years and that item had never been on the menu.   Just by way of chat, and in no way complaining, I went on to tell him what the dish was served with in the hope he would come back and say oh that will be .. however what he did say was OK - fine - well lets say we used to serve that, but we don't now and he turned with a face like thunder and walked away leaving me and my husband shocked and embarrassed.   We decided just to leave our drinks, unpaid for, and on our way out asked to speak to the Manager who we told the story to. All he said was sorry. No questions, never asked who out waiter was, nothing.   I was very disappointed in the service, so much so I felt the need to write this review and I do hope you will make it available to others.",
