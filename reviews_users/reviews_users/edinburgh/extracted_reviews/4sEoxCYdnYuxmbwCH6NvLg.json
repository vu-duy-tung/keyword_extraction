    "text": "In Edinburgh on holiday, we came across this restaurant and made reservations with our new friends from tour.  Everything about this place is excellent: food, variety, service, atmosphere, etc.  we ordered the prix fixe tasting menu and were \"wowed\" by each and every morsel. Every new dish provided us with a unique set of flavors.  And the dishes just kept coming.    If I had one complaint, it's that there was just too much food.  Come here hungry.  The spices were mostly NOT hot, just flavorful.  I suspect that they can heat up the plates a bit, but we did not mind the great dishes that did not burn our tongues.  Don't hesitate to go here!",

    "text": "Came here while in Edinburgh because of the high reviews on Yelp. We came early and was asked to wait while they were still cleaning the floors. We sat for about 10 min. and was seated. I was really looking forward to a great Indian meal, but what we got was really bland food. Since this was the second Indian restaurant we had while in UK that was bland and flavorless, we figured this is just how it is served on the other side of the pond. It seemed like the food needed some more flavoring or cooked longer to bring out the taste. Was very disappointing, although the restaurant was very clean and the bathroom was very nice.",

    "text": "A nice Saturday lunch with my husband to Mumbai Mansion.  We are here fairly frequently and this time it is with a \"living social\" discount voucher.    I like the veggie & non spicy options they have on the menu but I was a bit disappointed that they could not accommodate my request to add paneer Indian cheese with my vegetable korma, even though I advised I was happy to pay the difference in cost.    The staff are attentive and the food is very prompt and tasty.  The restaurant is spotlessly clean and well presented.   A nice touch is the place mats that are done as the Calcutta new paper and you can sit and read their news articles which are humerus.    A great local Indian restaurant which I will be back to soon no doubt.",

    "text": "I enjoyed my visit here. I placed my trust in the helpful waiter to choose what I ate, and was rewarded with two tasty courses. I'm not sure the place is capable of outstanding culinary fireworks, but it terms of reliable, fresh Indian dishes, I was very happy with the place.  Overall, we said: \"I was really pleased with Mumbai Mansion. I feel that I could go there again, put my trust in the waiter's choices, and be served some more good dishes. If you're in the neighbourhood, I'd certainly say to you that it's worth stopping in to sample some of their high quality dishes.\"",

    "text": "One of my favourite Edinburgh Indians. The food is always tasty and well presented. I like the fact that there are curries on the menu you don't get anywhere else in Edinburgh. When I have brought friends that like a vindaloos they have often complained it is not spicy enough. I have never enjoyed vindaloos but the spicy dishes I order are spicy enough for me and still allow the flavours of the other ingredients to shine through. Best gulab jamun and kulfi I have ever had and I don't usually do desserts especially not Indian desserts. Usually find them too sweet.  Staff are friendly and attentive.",

    "text": "The food wasn't really good here, a bit drab; definitely under salted and built for mild tastes. It would be ideal if you are the kind of diner who thinks ketchup is overly spicy. The service was also lack luster, although the manager is a very funny and attentive man. Still, I need better food to tempt me to face unwelcoming staff. It could have been worse, but it could be a WHOLE lot better.",

We were served by a waiter called Mitu who explained the menu with us & he was not to pushy trying to coax us into the most expensive dishes & drinks on the list ( not like other restraunts I could name ) We will definitely be going back there in the near future to sample this Great Indian .",

    "text": "One of the best Indian restaurants in Edinburgh. Plenty of vegetarian options and they are all fresh and very tasty. Not drowned in sauce and oil like many other places. Nice decor and quick service. Portion size is not generous and a bit pricey compared to others but this is one of my favorite Indian restaurants. They also cater for allergy sufferers no problem. A great place to dine.",
