    "text": "Absolutely the best meal I've probably ever had! First time trying Haggis, it was delicious! Scotch pie was so flavorful and loaded with baked beans on top! Delicious, filling and flavorful! Other restaurants have a lot to live up to after trying the food here. The best came after, we met the lovely Shona who owns the restaurant, what a sincere, genuine person! You can tell a lot of love went into her cooking, it definitely came out in the taste of the food.  I wish I could take Shona's cooking back to the states with me. 12-18-2018 stopped by at 3:00pm it was closed! 03-21-19 in town stopped by again at 1:30pm it was closed. Does anyone know if this is closed permanently?",

    "text": "The Thistle Stop Cafe does a fine quick breakfast with smiling staff and good lattes.   It's quaint, tucked underground off an alley behind the Royal Mile, and is sparsely decorated with off-white walls in greyish plaid print and minimal art that looks like it came right off the shelves of T.K. Maxx.  I had a cheese and onion toastie and my partner a full breakfast with a sunny side up egg, toast, beans, mushrooms, thick round bacon, a hash brown, sausage, and half a tomato that could have been grilled a lot longer.  My toastie was grilled to perfection (the cheese was perfectly melty and hot to the touch), and it came with a side of corn chips that I could have done without. They were a bit too hard and a bit too dry, and might have been rounded out by a bit of tomato salsa or a touch of guacamole. Or maybe the other half of my fiance's tomato, appropriately grilled!  I'd come again in a pinch.",

Sorry I didnt snap pics but my sons had the \"Full English Breakfast\" complete with very tasty Bacon, Eggs, Beans, Toast Tomato and Potato Pancake. My wife had a \"Bacon/Cheese Toasty\" and I had a \"Bacon, Cheese & Tomatoe Panini\" (panini just $1 more than the Toasty). Waiter was attentive, coffee was good and food came out quickly and very tasty. Also, the seating area was nice. Happy we found this little place. Look for the hanging sign and turn into the little alley!  :-)",

    "text": "This review is from the perspective of someone who had not tried haggis, neeps and tatties before so I don't know what to compare it against. We came here on a Sunday afternoon. It's a small place with less than 10 tables but service is good. You can see the kitchen and see them cook stuff there so good job with cleanliness. About the food, I found it strictly average. Everything except Scottish pie was very average and we ended up with a lot of leftovers. Maybe it was just how scottish food is but I found the experience quite average. Prices are reasonable and service is good so try the cafe for a quick bite to eat.",

The food wasn't the best, but it was good enough and came out quick so we could get back to being tourists.   The service was also good, especially compared to other parts of Europe I've been in.   The place was pretty nice on the inside and very cozy.  Finally, everything was pretty well-priced, so I'd have no qualms recommending this place to other people who need a quick bite to eat before being on their way",

Look for the big sign on the royal mile, duck down a secluded close and turn right.  service is quick, tea is hot and tasty and the prices are reasonable.  Looking forward to stopping in again!",
