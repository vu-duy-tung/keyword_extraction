For other Americans visiting, this is excellent food but some staples of American Chinese restaurants aren't offered (Peking ravioli/dumplings, general gao's chicken), but everything we got was delicious.",

    "text": "This is a really good Chinese, I first heard about them after being recommended to give it a try from a friend. I have never actually been there in person so can give no details on what the restaurant is actually like inside, but the food tastes great, and that's the most important thing. Me and a vegetarian friend found that there were plenty of options on their menu to be tempted by and I eventually opted for chicken chow mein and found that the dish was great and had lots of flavour to it. What's more is that it came with lots of vegetables, which made me feel justified in eating it all. The delivery time was quite long, taking about 40 minutes but the price was reasonable and would definitely order again from here.",

    "text": "I really love Loon Wah! This is the place my family used to get our Christmas dinner - their banquet includes aromatic crispy duck, which I prefer to any Christmas turkey! I was in here so much when I was a teenager that they knew my name, it's that good! I know this isn't exactly what one looks for in a Chinese, and believe me they're great in every other way too, but I can recommend this place particularly for its Chinese chips. Chips that have a lovely Chinese-food taste to them. Yum! Anyway, in my opinion, no Christmas day / journey home at night is complete without Loon Wah. For some reason my family has gone all traditional now so Loon Wah won't be part of our festivities. This is definitely the tragedy of the year.",

The service is excellent, the staff are extremely friendly in person and over the phone, the delivery is quick and it's just yummy! There is a great choice for vegetarians with lots of tofu dishes, you can also get an excellent mixed meat and tofu for the meat-eaters who also like tofu. I particularly like the fact that the dishes have a lot of vegetables in them. Never disappoints!",

Although all good, they do not match in any way the Loon Wah on price, quality and portion size. The set meals are excellent value for money. I am a typical scotsman and always have to have a chicken curry and theirs is amazing, I get it hot with green chillies, they will make dishes to your liking which is great.. The rice is the benchmark of a chinese and it's tops. Get wafer paper prawns and see the freshness. A lot of people will not trust some chinese for seafood, you will not be disappointed here. The hot and spicy or peking ribs are to die for and you get loads for 4.50. This is the best chinese takeaway in Edinburgh by far, trust me, I have been going to this place for over 10 years and tried most other places by recommendation and the have never matched up. Take my word The Loon Wah is exceptional.",
