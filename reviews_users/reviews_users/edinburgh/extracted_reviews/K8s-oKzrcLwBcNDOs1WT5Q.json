    "text": "Ravenous is a great sandwich bar located on Dundas Street and offers great quality food at very good prices. The sandwich bar is relatively new to Edinburgh and opened only a few months ago. I was first attracted to the bar by the modern decor and the cool name. The bar does breakfasts and lunches- in the morning you can have porridge and rolls, although I have not tried this yet.  In the afternoon, you can get a good selection of sandwiches, soups and paninis and there is also a good range of salads, where you can get a selection of salad to choose from to put in a salad box.  There is a few seats in there although not many, and the place can get pretty busy at lunch times as the office workers fill the place, but the staff were very good at providing quick and polite service.",

    "text": "Ravenous is a great little cafe/sandwich bar located very centrally. I normally visit at lunchtime and have only tried their soup but it is always delicious. They are extremely reasonably priced and the staff are very friendly and cheerful. It's very clean and modern, although there are no toilet facilities. It is quite small so only has 3 tables which means on a busy lunchtime it is sometimes hard to get a seat. They do takeaway though and although I haven't tried them yet the sandwiches and salads look very tasty and fresh. All in all, a super little cafe which I would recommend to anyone looking for an inexpensive, tasty lunch.",
