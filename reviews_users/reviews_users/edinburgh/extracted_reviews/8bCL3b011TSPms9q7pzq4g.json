I like habit burger in CA better, it think becos the burger is quite lean, i perfer a little fat. however, it took 45mins to deliver 1st thing to the table, and even missed the corn fitters, but i was full anyway, so it was good to be missed.   Price are very reasonable.  we had a burger meal, one side of onion ring and 2 beers for 33.",

    "text": "Good if you like '80s tunes at a reasonable level of volume (wasn't that off-putting) and the carbon-footprint reducing nature of the ethos behind the place.  Not sure the toilets have had a makeover but the rest of the place has clearly had a going over for a stripped-back, bare brick affair. It's well lit, which is a bonus when comparing it to some of its contemporaries.  We were a party of three but ended up with a fourth burger free due to a waitress error (extra chips arrived too and we weren't charged for the correct burger so they overdid themselves in making up for a very minor slip). The burgers we did order filled us up though so the other one unfortunately went to waste. The chips are shaved rather than cut & were wolfed with gusto.  I had chicken but those that ordered meat expressed no complaints (I had none either). No reason to think that Belted can't continue as it is for many a year. No fireworks but decent food pleasantly served.",

    "text": "I'm a bit split here so I'm going with 3*  So, Belted replaces the fab and much missed Wok and Wine. It is in that awkward basement location so it is trying to attract attention and thats probably where my issues lie.  So, I'll go with the good: Gluten free catered from. I really enjoyed my burger. Good balance of being juicy but not dripping everywhere. I also got to choose how it was cooked so I opted for medium. Gluten free buns were the best I'd had in town. They held together very well and maintained the contents. Any gf peeps reading this will get it - eg. you bite in and low and behold the roll starts to break up and the contents go everywhere. Not here!  All burgers come with bun, salad and fries. For 1 more you can upgrade to sweet potato fries and these were very good! I went with normal fries which were also excellent. Almost in the shape of a crisp and so damn good. I really enjoyed my meal here.  So why 3 stars? The music, blasting out onto the street like you are on an 18-30 Kavos holiday. I did query this going in but I was assured by Blythe R this would be different inside as he'd been in before at lunchtime but it wasn't. It was so off putting and I initially didn't want to go in. Maybe it was because it was a Saturday night, but dear god kill the music blasting out. I did see a large group of guys initially look keen as it was burgers, chips, etc but then walk away due to the music.  So, more burger choice in Edinburgh but bring your earplugs if you want a bit of peace with your food!",

    "text": "First, I wanted to order something from Belted Burgers with Deliveroo, but they only accept credit card, so driven by hunger, I walked the mile and came over.  Well let me tell you one thing: The service was great, you had the feeling of being really welcome. The food came extremely fast (10 minutes) but... it was okay. It was fine, but in my opinion not above average. The Sweet Potato Fries (Isn't it normally chips in British?) were really good, but also not better then the other burger restaurants I already went to.  The burger was the most average, it tasted okay, but the meat was a little to dry and I know, I only ordered the ordinary, normal burger, but I think, there was to few other stuff beside meat on the burger.  Even the ordinary, standard burger should be in some kind extraordinary. I think they should ask how you like your beef. In the moment I ordered, I didn't thought of telling, that I prefer my meat rare. If they had asked, I would have told it, but so I got a medium to well done beef.  I really thought about giving 4/5, due to the great service, but through the average burger I stay with good 3/5, and with a recommendation to test it out and taste for yourself.",
