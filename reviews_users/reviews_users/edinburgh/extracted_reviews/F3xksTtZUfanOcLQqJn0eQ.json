We went recently for the dim sum and found it easily the best eastern style food we have eaten in this country. Nearly as good as some of the dim sum we have had in Shanghai.   We checked out the buffet and will definitely be avoiding it, looks like the normal mass produced junk you find at these kind of places.",

Unfortunately, the quality of their dim sum has gone downhill. I went to Saigon Saigon for lunch today and I was SO DISAPPOINTED. First, they've increased the price. Their dumplings used to be just 2.90-3.20; now it's 3.50. Second, the dim sum are VERY OILY. They tasted like they've been bathed in dated oil. Overall, I would not recommend Saigon Saigon if you want to try authentic Cantonese Dim Sum.",

    "text": "After landing from an 8 flight and driving directly from LHR to Edinburgh, suffering motion sickness after not being able to stand still for long before getting in the car for our drive, and being exhausted, we arrived in Edinburgh starving.  We searched the streets close to 9-ish looking for somewhere to eat after we spent some time relaxing in the Apex. Finally, something was open. In bright letters, \"Saigon, Saigon\". We looked at eachother - to hell with it. It was a tiring day and we just wanted to eat something.  I am not going to say that Saigon Saigon is the most traditional or authentic place out there, but it hit the spot. The waitress took our orders and could tell we needed a drink (was it that obvious?) and handed us our menus. We ordered rice, a noodle dishes, and two vegetable dishes with spring rolls. I have no idea why two people thought ordering this much food was a good idea, but we ate like pigs. Starving, mad, ravished pigs.   The restaurant was clean, quiet, and spacious. Asian and non-Asian diners alike dined here on the two visits we made to Saigon Saigon. Beside our table a woman and her Scottish fiance were spending an evening with her Chinese family and everybody from her elderly relatives to her hubby to be seemed satisfied with their food.   The food was good, we feasted shamelessly. Was it the best I've ever had? I don't know. But after that long of a day, after being jet-lagged beyond beliefs, and almost losing my in-flight meal in the Scottish countryside, Saigon Saigon was as close to heaven as it was going to be. And we were happy to go. If we're back in Edinburgh soon, we will be back.",

I realize that dim sum is usually a lunch meal, but it is advertised for dinner as well at Saigon Saigon. When we came in we were given a print off of all the dim sum items that were sold out. It turned out that most of what we wanted was on that list, but we decided to persevere and try new things. After we waited about half an hour our order was finally taken, and then 5 minutes later the waitress came back and told us 3 of the things we ordered were now sold out as well. This happened one more time before we could finally secure our dinner order. *whew* Once the food came it was delicious. Everything we got was cooked perfectly and didn't disappoint. Trying to order dessert however was another fail and required us flagging down a manager after waiting another half an hour on that. We never did get a drink refill either, although the mandarin speakers at the table next to us seemed to get prompt service. So for food (what was left of it) I give 5 stars, and for service I give 1 star. I'd recommend coming earlier and on a weekday if you want to try it.",

Very generous sizes and delicious.  All that for only 23. Its always a bit of a risk getting take out, but it tasted just as good as what it would have should we have eaten in. Can't rate the dining experience but it looked cosy and clean.. and in my eyes- as long as the food is good, im happy!",

Chinese food generally are the cheaper options in restaurants, so at 8 quids for buffet or about 6-8 quids a dish, the food isn't cheap by Chinese restaurant standards.  This is far worse than most Chinese take out fast food restaurants and definitely much worse than Panda Express (if you are from the States).",

After all, this was a local for some of my relatives, so it must be good right?   The place filled up fast after we arrived, but luckily we got our order in relatively quickly. I completely overordered, my eyes bulging at the offerings on display in the menu. Prawn cheung fun, chives and prawn dumplings, custard buns, bbq pork buns (although no one would believe how rock and roll these taste - one of the regrets about going veggie...) ho fun, noodles, chinese greens, spinach and garlic, the list goes on...  What I like, i really like about Saigon Saigon is that all the food arrived as cooked. And when I mean as cooked, I mean, steaming and as fresh as you could imagine. Nothing tasted like a microwave had been near any of the food, which is much more than can be said for other places in the city centre. I scalded myself multiple times rushing to tuck in to the varous plates we had ordered. My only quibble would be that there was no soy sauce or hot sauce for dipping/flavouring dumplings but I was really impressed overall with Saigon Saigon. Dim sum after 4pm? I think I must.",

The restaurant itself is set in a nice building and it was relitively quiet when I arrived, although busied up considerably during our meal which I thought was quite unusual for a Tuesday afternoon! I decided on some Scallop dim sum which was very nice, not sure what everyone is raving about if I'm perfectly honest but it was a nice starter, and moved on to the Szechuan chicken which was literally hotter than the sun! It's probably the way it's supposed to be but it was never that hot at my local take-out!  It's inexpensive and tasty Chinese fare, nothing to blow your socks off but it was fine for a city centre restaurant.",

The buffet is quite tasty and always has a good selection of dishes. I cant remember the price but its not that bad. What I really like is the main menu. Its huge! Theres like everything you could think of on there! And the Dim Sum is also really really good as well I think up there in my top 10 places for Dim Sum. But what I found was the portions of food you got where massive as well. I couldn't even finish my plate and almost burst eating my fortune cookie which is mandatory regardless if I pop like an angry bird. The servers were also friendly and made sure you were properly taken care of. Overall one of the better chinese restaurants in the city, not the best food in the world but definitely one of the best in Edinburgh.",

Crisp wrappers with sesame seeds on one side and filled with perfectly cooked prawns and nothing else and so meaty!  They were good size but I still didn't want to share so I ate faster than Dale so I could get my fill.  Then came the szechuan beef - too hot for me but he loved it and the couple next to us were enjoying theirs as well.  In fact we made friends with them and they told us that we were eating at the very best Chinese place in Edinburgh.  We also had sweet & sour pork - outstanding although I was disappointed that there was no onion in the dish.  We also had the mushroom egg foo young.  It's not served like we're used to in America.   Instead it's sort of chopped up and there is no bean sprouts.  It was still wonderful and all of the food tasted so fresh.  We shared a banana fritter with a scoop of ice cream.  If I ever visit Scotland again, this will be my first stop for dinner and I will order plenty of the sesame prawn rolls!",

    "text": "Although Saigon Saigon helped me realise the wonderfulness that is Dim Sum, I'm afraid this is where our journey ends.  The service has improved, the food has not.   My pork buns (tee hee, buns) had very little meat in them and my pumpkin balls were overdone. Also, I'm pretty sure no one at our table ordered tripe but it showed up and was on the bill anyway (with 15 people each ordering different dishes it's hard to say though).  My main problem though was that despite two glasses of water and a pot of tea I left this restaurant last night dying of thirst, with a fuzzy head and my mouth burning, symptoms that I still have 12 hours later. These are the telltale signs that I have eaten too much MSG. I won't say that Saigon Saigon is adding MSG because I don't know (it's a Chinese restaurant and it wouldn't be surprising), it's possible some sauce or dough or something they use is just full of the stuff.   I don't blame Saigon Saigon. Chinese cuisine is known to be chock full of glutamates but unfortunately, it means I can't go back without clearing the next two days of any kind of thought and abstaining from hot drinks.  Good bye Saigon Saigon, it was nice while it lasted.",

    "text": "The Chinese restaurant so good, it was named twice...after a city in Vietnam which hasn't been called that in nearly forty years.  Yeah, not making loads of sense in my book.  Saigon Saigon is a buffet / dim sum establishment hoping that you will ignore the latter part of their menu (apparently).  I approached the restaurant located only a few meters from Princes Street on the basis that they offered dim sum, but when I mentioned I was ordering from it, I got a look indicating that I had stumbled over my line in the script.  I guess it's the obligation that I order the buffet and keep my mouth shut.  Far be it for me to accept the role given.  Saigon Saigon is packed nearly butt-to-elbow with tables with my chair sitting half on wood and half on the carpet leading to the door.  Like many restaurants in the UK, the bathrooms are rationed to a different floor.  Eventually, I browsed through the dim sum menu, one of the most expansive offerings I've ever seen, page after page, scallop dumplings, steam chicken claw with black bean sauce, golden tripe with satay sauce, beancurd rolls, pine nuts veg--what?  Yes, steam chicken claw, I didn't order that.  I did order three dishes, including mixed meat dumplings and something called pork egg congee.  When I asked what that was, the answer I got was oddly evasive. \"It's popular with Asian customers.\"  Is that \"cityspeak\" for \"it's not mean for you?\"  I call that a challenge.    I should have taken her advice.  It wasn't bad, just somewhat lacking in...umm... flavor.  The crispy egg and pork which topped it tasted good enough but the--I don't know--gruel tasted like unsalted, unsweetened rice pudding.  I know critics of this review will claim that congee IS unseasoned rice pudding.  I'll give you that.  In praise, the other two dishes were good and the prices reasonable, with each plate costing between three and four quid, putting it around $18 Canadian for the whole meal.    In full disclosure, I was not aware of Saigon Saigon's past when I enjoyed my meal.  Apparently, they went through a major sanitary controversy a couple of years ago, including fines and a temporary closure on health violations.  It's shocking such a thing could happen to a restaurant in such a prime location.  Enough time had passed that I can still judge Saigon Saigon on its own merits, and what I can take out of it was that it wasn't bad, but in the future, it would be better if I ordered the dim sum with a few friends.    And how about that buffet?  In a few words, it looked disgusting, meaning crappy western Chinese food is not exclusive to North American.  It makes me worried that there might not be a good Chinese restaurant in Edinburgh if one in such a prime location is unwilling to deliver quality food.    However, what I ordered was dim sum, and dim sum I enjoyed.  If you are wandering around Princes Street, Saigon Saigon is not the best place to enjoy a meal but considering so many of the other restaurants are fast food franchises, there are plenty worse.    Food:  3/5 Service:  2/5 Presentation:  2.5/5 Value:  3/5 Recommendation:  2.6/5",

The food is obviously overpriced and can not represent a Chinese cuisine at all. Most of the staff do not know what is manner at all!! We got one napkin for two people and the table next to us got none and had to ask twice for it. The lady sitting next to us ordered a Singapore rice but what was given was Singapore noodles. They claimed they didn't have the Singapore rice but that was what they should tell when taking orders. A girl called Amy was very unfriendly as a staff. You can have a cool characteristic but it just does not fit in a customer service position. I wonder how a restaurant like this could survive.",

And I mean ABSOLUTELY NO restaurants that are open except for Chinese and Indian restaurants. So this place became our life savor.   I'm probably a little biased about the food but when it's 0 Celsius outside and everywhere is dead, you'll appreciate anything they bring you. The food here was very authentic and delicious. I think we ordered braised pork and dim sum, and they were freaking delicious! If you're a Chinese food lover like me and find yourself in Edinburgh around Christmas or New Years, this is THE place to go!",

    "text": "OK I must admit that I was a little apprehensive trying this place after reading fellow Yelper's reviews and also it having a Vietnamese (wtf) name... not to mention an all you can eat lunch buffet (read: DANGER WILL ROBERTSON! :P) but I had a craving for yum cha (dim sum) so thought for the sake of the Yelp community I'd try it out and report my findings.  So, had the Dim Sum/Yum Cha - note that this is a not a trolley-based service, rather you order from the picture-book and it comes out after about 20 minutes. Was able to order dishes at different times and they all came out roughly after the same time.  Food quality was quite good, surprisingly good - the pork buns (cha siu bau) and prawn rice noodles (cheung fun) were really good, the pork ribs (pai gwat), sticky rice and crabmeat dumplings (siu mai) were all adequate.. I've had better in Hong Kong and perhaps Sydney however they weren't horrible. Turnip cake (lo buck gow) was also very nice. Custard tarts were very nice also for sweets.  My dining partner had never been to Yum Cha/Dim Sum before - she was impressed - and I must say it was a good introduction to Yum Cha quality-wise.  Service was the typical \"fucks not given\" (phrase borrowed from a Melbourne yelper) Chinese restaurant style that we've globally all come to love however with a little persistence I was able to get all the food, tea refills and bill that I wanted :)  PS: I did note there was a Chinese-language-only larger Dim Sum menu available than the picture-book-for-starters however I can't read Chinese and only saw this after getting the bill so can't comment on the dishes without pictures (tm).",

The first time we had some dim sum which was good but not San Francisco Chinatown good. But hey this is Scotland so OK. We stopped again to hit their buffet which was about to shut off. They probably should have given us a discount being much of it was gone and old but it still tasted OK. The place seemed full of Asian people each time we were there with these large soup bowls full of noodles so I guess it's a pretty decent place.",

The duck had many bones so it was quite difficult to eat my soup, which was the main course.   I have had others that required some manual intervention, like mussels for example.  But little duck bones weren't fun.  I think this is really a buffet place that also makes menu items to order.    Go around the corner to wagamama.  While it's not a 5 Star, it's a bit better.   Or skip the Asian food and go to Dishoom which is next door to wagamama.",

It was also only luke warm. The wontons were lacking flavor and fell apart. The noodles had no flavor, there were only 3 pieces of vegetables in the large bowl of soup.  I never complain at restaurants but this was so bad I told them how bad it was. He went and told others. Finally the person who took our order came out and  said he would give us 15% off the soup. We left the entire bowl sitting on the table only a couple bites eaten. This made me more mad then them not taking anything off.   My friends chicken soup had lots of flavor.   I went across the street to McDonalds and had a double cheese burger. I walked back to my hotel and the burger was still hotter then the soup was when they brought it to the table.   Maybe if we were Chinese we would have received better service and food.",

We got horrible diarrhea and kept vomiting. There was one second we thought we gonna die in Edinburgh(not trying to exaggerate what happened to us at all) Eventually we end up in A&E. It almost ruined our whole trip. The restaurant is seriously a nightmare. It was criticized to have hygiene issue in 2012 and was closed down. Now they reopen with same kind of issue. GOD KNOW WHAT THEY ARE MAKING AND WHAT FOOD SOURCES THEY ARE USING BACK IN THE KITCHEN. If you don't want to risk you life, KEEP AWAY FROM THIS CHINESE RESTAURANT.",

We came around 7:30 pm and they informed us that they were going to close early tonight. No problem, we knew we just want a quick meal, we can always take-out if we didn't finish.  We had the egg soup, tofu with broccoli, another plate of vegetables, beef noodles (Beef Ho Fun) and some other stuff.  A couple dimsum - they serve dimsum all day - what restaurant does this--this is a HUGE plus for me. We ordered the Viet spring rolls and char siu crispy bun (triangle pork pastry)  You will love the menu...pictures are detailed and right to the point. You get what you order.

Now on to the HORRENDOUS customer service (if you can call it that!) The ordering system works that they give you a slip and you have to write all the relevant order numbers you want on it. I ordered Sweet and Sour Pork, and boiled rice, they gave me the rice and a completely other wrong dish. I tried to send it back and they then decided to tell me I ordered the wrong dish, I then showed them the slip clearly showing them the CORRECT code for the Sweet and Sour Pork. They then decided to try and find who took the order and three different waiters huddled around my table arguing over who took the wrong order and placing blame. Finally they then took the wrong dish and swapped it leaving my rice to go freezing cold.   Basically DO NOT GO HERE.",
