How had I missed it on my visit previously? Honestly: because this is the girl who goes straight in for the pizza. But, boy, oh boy; before I went veggie, I adored a creamy, rich carbonara. So it's been years since I've had carbonara.  I'm going to go all out and say that Nova Pizza have created the best veggie carbonara you will ever feast upon. I dare the staunchest of carnivores to give it a try and truly tell me that something's missing. The smoked seitan fills the meaty void just perfectly and the dish is wonderfully rich and creamy, just as carbonara should be.  Portions are generous. I wasn't uncomfortably stuffed but had a pleasant satisfied feeling that lasted well after the meal. The ingredients are high quality and it shows. Most dishes can be made either vegetarian or vegan.  Please do pay a visit and indulge in Nova Pizza's wonderful creations. I'll be back soon and I'm going to make sure I have a starter to sample more of the menu. Oh, and there may just be room for the disaronno affogatto for dessert. Why, it would be rude not to!",

The size of the portions is generous and the presentation was really good.  We also shared a pizza topped with carbonara sauce and home made smoked seitan , it was very fresh and the crust was thin and wonderfully crispy.  A great experience and will gladly come back again.",

Small, unassuming and homely in a traditional Italian red and white checked tablecloth style, Nova's ambience is cute and quaint. However the pizzas are seriously scrumptious.   With a full, extensive Vegetarian and Vegan menu boasting Vegan cheese, Seitan and every veg topping you could possibly desire my meal here on Wednesday 9 November 2016 was truly fantastic. Our party of four people, carnivores included, all loved Nova.   We ordered both Vegetarian and Vegan pizzas and calzones. My pizza which was called the \"Vegan\" on the menu came topped with mushroom, onion, sweetcorn, peppers, aubergines, courgette and Vegan cheese and was delicious. A couple of bottles of really great Pinot Grigio, a bargain at 10 each, complimented our food perfectly.   Although full after our mains we shared a Vegan peanut butter and jam cheesecake, just to sample it, and it was luscious. Nova definitely needs to be booked in advance, as there wasn't a free table during our midweek visit and we were very glad we had pre-booked a table.   A constant flow of people called in to collect takeaway pizzas, yet despite the fact that staff were extremely busy the service we received was flawless. The one and only problem being that there isn't a Nova Pizza in my own hometown of Belfast. I'll definitely be returning when I'm next in Edinburgh.",

We got the gnocchi (amazing), white blue cheese pizza (amazing), and the Messicana pizza (also great). The only suggestion I would have is to reduce the spiciness of the Messicana pizza. I feel like the three spice symbols they put next to it are not proportional to the spice level of that particular pizza. I eat really spicy foods and I was coughing with how spicy it was. To be proportional the pizza should have 10 or so spice symbols next to it. Or would have the pepper served on the side. The other thing was that I made a reservation through the website but the waitress had no record of it, fortunately they had empty table when we arrived...",

    "text": "I had wanted to try this place for aaaages! I made a group booking for a vegan meetup and because they only have around 21 seats they asked if I could send them a list of pre-ordered food choices. I made a Word table with everyone's names and their starters, mains, and desserts. I loved this set up and I think all restaurants should require the same; it really saves time on waiting for people to make up their minds! Email correspondence back and forth was great (for an accurate note of vegan menu options they can email you a separate menu, the version on the website isn't that clear of what is and isn't vegan) and I had the document of food orders with me on my phone and reminded everyone what they had ordered when the food started arriving.    The pizzas came loaded with vegan cheese (or they have dairy options, too) and were delicious. My personal preference is for bases a bit more soft and doughy and less crispy, but others saw this as a plus point. Starter sizes were generous, and if you order a bruschetta you may not manage a pizza main to yourself unless you love love love bread. Really love bread. I opted for the potato, cheese, and pesto pizza - delicious!!! Then, I had the pizza dolce - two pizza base slices topped with a chocolate and hazelnut spread and icing sugar, which was also very tasty and not too overly sweet. I got the coconut cheesecake to take away which was really creamy - chocolate cheesecake was also offered as an alternative flavour.  They have wine and beer available and BYOB is also an option; it's 3 on a bottle of wine and 1.50 on a beer. They also accept cards. Booking is highly recommended!",

    "text": "I was actually chatting with James W just this week and he mentioned the amazing four cheese pizza at Nova, so when weekend work mode required pizza, I was happy to find that this spot is on Deliveroo and promptly ordered a pizza and a calzone (as back up).  I hadn't realized it was a 100% veggie restaurant but it actually made my late night pizza binge feel a little bit more healthy. It was nice to note that their menu is chock full of GF and vegan options. They are definitely tucked into my back pocket for future party catering - sometimes it's tough to find a spot that covers all your bases but still keeps the carnivores happy.  The verdict on the food? I was pleasantly surprised. First off, their dough is INCREDIBLE. Honestly, I could just eat the dough all. damn. day. I was a bit skeptic about their nutella dessert pizza, but after this dough love fest, i'd definitely give that a go next time around. I ordered the mozzarella and veggie ham calzone and i'd pass on it next time around. I was expecting the veggie ham to be in chunks versus slices and as much as i'm not opposed to veggie meat replacements, this one just didn't have enough punch to it. I think it needed more salt or sauce? Pretty bland all around.   But the four cheese pizza? Hot damn! First and foremost, if you are NOT a fan of blue cheese - do not order this pizza! I happen to be a fan but I could see this turning some folks off. However, if you love a little blue - this pizza will be right up your alley. It arrived piping hot and a good size for such a reasonable price. It is SO rich! I can usually devour a pizza pretty quickly but only made it through a few pieces of this one before throwing in the towel for the night. That means there is deliciously cheesy lunch waiting for me tomorrow as well. At 8 for the pizza, that's not a bad deal. It definitely piqued my interest enough to return to this little spot somewhere down the road.  Until next time Nova...",

On our way up to the new town to find a budget sit-down restaurant we discovered this little place.  Red and white table cloths, olive oil in the window, pizza in the display cabinet topped with plump tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella; I feel like I have stepped into a Roman neighbourdhood.  Now, an authentic Italian restaurant is quite a find. This place is run by Italians and offers a good variety of pizza and pasta options with fresh and tasty ingredients, all at pretty honest prices. The biggest novelty lies in the fact that Nova offers authentic vegetarian Italian food.   I had the soya mince lasagna (6.50). My friend opted for one of the specials of the day, the four cheese and mushroom gnocchi (7). His portion was very generous whereas mine was pretty small but super tasty. He commented that his dish was \"glorious\" and kept mentioning how good it was all day.   We will be back.",

Some nice salad, greens etc?   Did they not get the idea that a huge number of vegans don't like fake soy products?  Would much rather have just some tofu!  Much healthier. The starters and entrees are all the same in flavors.   I love that they have a large vegan and gluten free menu but would much prefer it be only vegan and include more healthy options like sauteed Italian greens and lighter fare to go along with the heavy, oil rich pizza and pasta.  Seems like the gluten free bread had oats in it...not sure...but it was delicious. The vegan gnocchi was so heavy it was kind of overwhelming. Delicious for a few bites but way too rich. The servers should suggest some lighter options to start and then to share a pizza or pasta...(but they don't have lighter options) If it's your first year vegan...run to it you will love it.  If you are used to good Italian food and vegan a long time you will likely find it very heavy.",
