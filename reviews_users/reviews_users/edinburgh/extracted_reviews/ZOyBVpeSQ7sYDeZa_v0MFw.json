This is a lovely place, as Jonathan M has said its location is beautiful (if a bit odd). The restaurant is really well decorated and laid out, I came here for a birthday party with about 40 people and we all fit in nicely. I'm not sure if the quality of the food was high as I am a total Japanese food novice, but it tasted good to me. If there was one thing, I did find the portion sizes a bit small, but then again everything is small in Japan.",

It still wasn't the best sushi I've had in Edinburgh, especially for the price, but I enjoyed it. It maybe more ideal for the hot meals it offers. The service wasn't particularly good but I have nonspecific incidents or complaints. All in all I wouldn't go out of my way for tang's, but certainly wouldn't avoid it either: thus the three star so so rating",

I had a similar experience to Terminator84 regarding the service. The night I was in it was very busy they seemed understaffed and our food order took almost an hour to come out.

Order was Miso and the regular sushi and sashimi with one of their special rolls and prawn tempura. Soup was good although a little disconcerted that there was not a proper spoon with it and when we asked for a spoon were given big old dessert spoons! Tempura was good... Sushi and sashimi were also fine but it's always going to be tough to get the freshest fish. The special roll was a fairly basic affair but also ok. Sake was a bit special tasting, i thought i was getting a \"tang\" of soft cheese from it!   Dinner for two and drinks... 90 pounds... Will go again after i've been to all the other places discover that this is the best!",

The decor was nice but nothing exceptional. Dining downstairs on a dreary day, was a cosy experience. Upstairs there is a larger dining area. The staff were very friendly & I was satisfied with my experience at Tangs & feel it compares well with most of the other Japanese places in town. I will most certainly return.",

I went last night and I can honestly say that I have had better sushi at pret-a-manger. Coincidentally we shared the rainbow and tocusen bento box (30). Not even the rice was fresh never mind anything else and there was nothing more adventurous than tuna on my plate. The service was ok but that is the only positive thing I can draw from the experience. Does joellis1974 work there?? You should take a wander along to Sushiya at the Haymarket end of Dalry Road. It could be described as 'sterile' but that is authentically Japanese and exactly as it should be. Korean chef???? Maybe they should open a Korean restaurant then Hmmmm?",

I was first introduced it by a friend who I met in first year from Tokyo. She said this was by far the best and most authentic Japanese restaurant in Edinburgh, so I was eager to try. We came together one evening in the new year of 2012 with my boyfriend and another friend to try out the food, and didn't leave disappointed.  The decor is minimalist, typically Japanese and quite classy. There are two floors, and the restaurant is conveniently located near the grassmarket. We ordered genmaicha tea, and my boyfriend and I went for the veggie bento boxex, which cost 12. I had heard that one of the chefs was vegan and so the vegetarian food here is taken very seriously. I can't remember what my friends got, but one went for the omnivore bento box.  The food arrived quickly, and the veggie bento box consists of: a seaweed salad, 6 sushi rolls, 3 with cucumber and 3 with avocado, some teriyaki tofu, Japanese sticky rice, and some miso soup on the side. Everything was absolutely perfect. I couldn't any fault with the fresh sushi and delicious tofu. The genmaicha tea was the perfect complement. The others also enjoyed their meal, and we  ending up spending 4 hours afterwards just chatting. The time flew by here. For pudding we shared a plate of mochi, which my Japanese friend (the expert) said were nice but not the same as those back home.   It was such a memorable evening that my boyfriend and I returned here to eat exactly the same thing in October to celebrate our 4th year anniversary. It was delicious once again, and we cleaned our palate afterwards with some green tea ice cream.  I am surprised at the amount of mediocre reviews here, as I would recommend it to anyone who loves Japanese food.",

You can sit in the chilled out restaurant with minimalist decor or you can order something to take away if you can't be bothered cooking.  I'd say that it's best to go at lunch times as they have some fantastic lunch deals including the Bento Box of the week for only 8.50. It's still great for dinner but is slightly more expensive than other Japanese restaurants but for the good standard of food and nice atmosphere of the restaurant I don't mind paying a wee bit extra.  In addition to the usual Bento Boxes and sushi rolls part of the menu take an almost tapas style format offering miniaturised versions of other things on the menu. There's a few things on it that I haven't tried before, such as various different seaweeds with different seasonings. I will need to try them sometime!  Overall, great standard of food if a little pricey and the standard of service is top notch.",

I am writing to thank you for making sure my taste for sushi is at least a LITTLE appeased. Now, sushi in Edinburgh is prohibitively expensive (my favorite phrase). Like, I could probably get a flight to Spain for 20 on Ryan Air and buy sushi while I'm there and come out spending less than I would have had I gone out for sushi in Edinburgh (as long as I didn't bring luggage).   Still, your weird little lunch box prices (under 10) that combine a teeny tiny bit of sushi with a bunch of other Japanese delights makes me feel full and happy and my hunger for raw fish satiated.   You also came down and asked what I thought about the new Bento Detox box, that I obviously loved because I basically licked the plate clean. And you're super for that, even if you just asked to be nice, I appreciated you pretending. Your brown rice skills are superb, as are you.  Thank you for my lovely meal,   steph",

I won't try and pretend that Tang's is a diamond in the rough in these respects. The fairly small menu contains no surprises, and is heavily adapted to suit our drab Western tastebuds. It did however, provide me with one of the tastiest, most well presented Katsu curries I've had in ages, where in an almost supernatural manner, the breadcrumbs stayed crunchy even when drowned in the sauce.  E-Bot's bento box wasn't bad either, though truth be told could better be described as \"good fun\" than \"top notch meal\". and the guy who served us was exceptionally nice and charmingly seemed quite embarrassed when I offered a tip.  Not mind-blowing, but a great little place for a meal.",

It's also super handy if you're visiting the National Gallery as it's directly opposite from it, just down from the Greyfriars Bobby statue.  We visited this week, and, while they didn't have any items on the menu that indicated they were vegan, the owner explained that one of his chefs is vegan, and that he would make me a dish that was definitely vegan. Vegan chef = big result!  I had a variation on the lunchtime special, which was a savoury pancake made from rice noodles, and some miso soup. It was lovely, and I'd go back again to see what else they came up with. The owner said that if he had more vegan customers, he would put on a special section of the menu. He's keen to make use of the skills of the vegan chef.   So vegans - get going!  And for all you meat eaters out there, my boyfriend had the lunchtime special, which was full of various meats - and, in his expert opinion, was 'very nice'.",

Split across two levels, with a small bar and eating area downstairs and large dining area upstairs - Tang's is perfect for large groups who revel in the complicated tastes of Japanese food. While the restaurants primary focus is on food made for sharing, there is plenty for smaller parties - both hot and cold food, and safe favourites to adventurous dishes prepared freshly. The Miso was splended, and looking around other dishes that were flying out of the kitchen also looked lovely.The atmoshpere was relaxed and comfortable, but somewhat quiet.  However, while the waiting staff are usually excellent, busier times lead to slower service - although this is to be expected.  Prices are also slightly on the expensive side.  Despite this however, Tang's is heading into its second year, and shows no sign of slowing up.",

My biggest problem with japenese food is trying to decide between hot or cold food, so I went for the Pork Bento Box (8.50) which contained both. The pork was lovely and tender, and the portion was very generous. I don't know what was in the sauce on it but it was delicious, as were the 6 mixed california rolls,3 types of japanese salad and Miso soup accompanying it.  My partner went for salmon California rolls and King Prawn teriyaki skewers, the prawns were huge and not overcooked as is so often the case in resturants.   The restaurant is quite small, but in my opinion this just adds to the intimate, family-run atmosphere of the place. What's more, all the gorgeous food on the menu can be ordered to take away as well. I will definitely be going back.",

It was one of the specials, and it was delish!  Something I have never seen or heard of being done before and I would go back just for that!  I have been to several sushi bars, and the menu here was a little smaller than what I had expected. BUT there is something to suit everyone. They have several specials for the day, and a lunch deal aswell.   My only qualms with Tang's were that it is maybe a little small. The waiter, yes, lovely as he was, seemed quite shy and uneasy when you asked questions, he didn't seem to know any more than we did about the food he was serving. I also did not like that all the food did not come at the same time. Granted they did tell us that some was ready and some not. But I still did not like sitting eating whilst Jenny had no plate in front of her.",

    "text": "Definitely not the best Japanese place in Edinburgh & certainly not the place to visit if you've never had sushi before.   Good service & no complaints about portion sizes or pricing but the fact that you cannot order nigris, sashimi etc. in ones & twos (as you can in pretty much every other sushi place I've been to) but instead on platters, makes the whole experience less fun. On the night I was there the tuna sashimi, whilst being in larger bits than I've had perviously, was rather pinker than I've come to expect so that also raised the odd doubt.   Can't comment on the Korean angle.",

    "text": "I randomly passed Tang's one evening and decided to pop in for dinner.  I didn't have high hopes for a place with a Chinese name serving Japanese food, but once inside, I was pleasantly surprised that the interior was pleasant and attractive.    The menu looked okay, so I decided to order green tea, pork gyoza, and chirashizushi (sashimi on rice).  The food tasted good, but I thought it seemed to take a very long time for the food to actually come out and, in the end, I thought it was pretty overpriced for what I got.  I'm not sure if good Japanese food is hard to find in Edinburgh, but coming from California, I would normally pay half the amount for what I got at Tang's.  I'd normally say skip Tang's, but if you've got a craving for Japanese food and you don't care about the price, it's a nice place.  One thing I thought was funny is that Tang's is directly across the street from the Guiness Book of World Record's most pierced person's shop (Elaine Davidson).  I saw her close up her shop for the night and it was the most exciting (and frightening) thing I'd seen in ages.",

I really should start writing the names down as otherwise I just end up horribly butchering the name, but order the hot-stone-bowl dish with egg on top as it was quite delicious.

    "text": "I visited Tang's on a Saturday evening, around 7pm.  The waiting staff seemed good, fixing our slightly wobbly table and taking orders quickly.  The interior was relaxing, with a panel resembling bamboo on one wall, solid wooden tables, and a very effective heating system (important in February!).    Myself and my boyfriend both ordered Asahi - cementing my belief that there is nothing like a cold, crisp beer with fresh sushi.  We also ordered a Garden Bento Box each, due to one count of vegetarianism, and one of genuine seafood dislike.  The  bento was rather pricey at 15 each, but for us was plenty of food for a main course.  It consisted of six maki rolls (good texture, fairly tasty); teriyaki tofu (melt-in the mouth deliciousness); salad and a portion of sticky rice.  There was also a small bowl of miso soup each.  The selection was definitely tasty, and not too daunting for those who aren't familiar with Japanese food.  One small problem was that the wasabi seemed uncharacteristically weak.  Wasabi is made from Japanese horseradish - you commonly are served with a little glob of it which can be stirred into soy sauce - and used as a dip for sushi.  I stirred my glob, but couldn't taste it in the soy sauce.  Being denied a mustardy assault on my senses was a little sad - but my dining partner was quite glad to forego that experience!  Also, the Garden Bento was a little pedestrian.  Having a mixed leaf salad which was fairly Italian in appearance did disappoint me.  Edamame beans, anyone?   However, after a dessert of coconut ice cream and a cookies and cream cheesecake, we footed the slightly hefty bill and left the restaurant happy and bursting at the seams.  I would happily return to Tang's, make up my own sushi platter with some of the slightly more exciting menu options, and soak up the wonderful ambience of the restaurant.",

    "text": "Tang's is probably the best Japanese restaurant in Edinburgh. Located just next to Greyfriar Bobby's, it can easily be overlooked by those going into town for a good meal, but don't make this mistake. With a selection of rice, noodles, sushi, Bento boxes and hot mains, Tangs is an complete Japanese restaurant, unlike many of the sushi bars in Edinburgh.  The sushi itself, although not as good as Bonsai, is still exceptional and the rice is the best around. The prawn tempura maki and salmon and avocado maki (both 4.50) are really well made and affordable on a sushi menu that has a tendency to be a bit pricey. We also tried the inside out duck sushi roll with Japanese omelette, which although baffling us with the description was really tasty.  The mains here are awesome, and Tang's is one of the few places where you will get high quality Japanese hot dishes. The katsu curry was brilliant, the breaded chicken in it being a highlight. As well as thi, the bento boxes are good, as is the Yaki Soba. The others dishes on the menu all look amazing, especially the grilled dishes, and I look forward to the next time. They are all quite expensive though, but the food is so good you won't care.  The building covers 2 floors and is a mix of traditional and modern Japanese decor. The staff are friendly and always chirpy. Also I forgot to mention the drinks; they do a great selection of Japanese rice wines as well as beers and soft drinks. The teas are really flavoursome as well, especially the burnt leaves one. Definitely a great place to go out for some authentic(ish) Japanese cuisine.",

    "text": "Perhaps Japanese food is not so popular here because that could be the only explanation for the positive reviews for Tang's on Yelp.  I feel badly giving it such a bad rating but if you are a seasoned consumer of Japanese fare, Tang's will be horribly disappointing and overpriced.   The sushi was the most pedestrian I have ever tried and the prices were comparable with upscale sashimi joints in the states. There were no creative house rolls and the maki roles we ate were tiny and pricey.   For entrees, we ordered curry chicken katsu, chicken teriyaki and black cod. The chicken katsu was soggy and buried in a very bland curry sauce. My sister's chicken teriyaki was entirely dark meat and every single piece was fatty. She ended up eating only the white rice. My cod didn't taste terrible but it was literally the smallest piece of fish I have ever been served as an entree. And I'm not one of those Americans who loves huge portions... this just happened to be comical. Charging 12.50 for a tiny, thin piece of fish felt like I was being robbed.   They were also very understaffed. The only 2 women working had to climb up to the third floor for every dish. However, they handled the high customer volume like champs.   Stick to what Scotland does best... Pub grub and Indian food.",

Compared to other Japanese restaurant in town, this place has more choices from sushi, ramen to don. I wasn't be able to find don in other Japanese restaurant previously. We ordered pork don, beef don, eel don and a spicy ramen (forgot the name, but actually we thought it wasn't that spicy). All of them were quite good and with sufficient amount. We also ordered a sashimi dish with salmon, tuna, shrimp and some other sea food in it. It was also nice but compared to the one I had at maki sushi it was alright.  The only two things I can complain about this restaurant would be: first, compared to some other Japanese restaurant, it was a little bit expensive here. (But Asian restaurant usually quite expensive in the UK) Two, you usually have to wait for a long time to have the food ready for you. So it would be better to have some chats with friends rather than having a quick meal here.",

The ramen bowls we both ordered were also quite good. But the place was just lacking in service whatsoever.   Was it a language issue? Or was it a rudeness issue? The single server we saw that day was too brusque and just not a personality people would get warm to. You don't slam a glass of water on the table. And it would probably be nice if you attempt to smile too. You ask a question if the food was okay but you're already on to the next table instead of attempting to hear what we had to say about it.

They get all mealy your bowl turns into an undifferentiated mealy mass. Ramen noodles should be springy and have some bite to them.  Buuuuut it turns out there's a worse option than boiling them to oblivion, and that's warming them but not cooking them through. These didn't even hit mealy; they were clearly not cooked and were just, well, soggy and gross, but in a new, innovative way.  Of course, I knew I was in for a bad time when I saw them pull prepackaged frozen gyoza & takoyaki out of a cooler and dump them in the fryer, but I'd already ordered, so I decided to see it through. And, well, now I have a new low bar for ramen, so at least the experience was novel?",

This year, in an opportune evening slot, I tried Tang's and it was great. While I was able to take a bit of time over the meal, I think you could get the ramen and be in and out in 40 minutes if you wanted.   And you should get the ramen. My boyfriend had Tonkotsu Ramen while I had Yokohama Ie-Kei Ramen. I won. Both were good but the stock in the latter is particularly rich and flavourful. I'd quite like to try the Hell Ramen and see how spicy it is too!  We also had yummy Apple Cider Pork Kakuni - you get a lot considering it's in the starter section and of course belly pork is very fatty so it can be quite intense. We also enjoyed the red bean mochi, though by that point we were ridiculously full!  They have Sapporo beer, which was my favourite when I was in Japan earlier this year, so that made me happy too.  Plus, the staff were friendly and helpful to top it all off.",

The place looks small but has an upstairs area, plenty of seating. Very relaxing environment. The menu is a bit confusing and the items are quite expensive unless you opt for the lunch menu which consists of ramen soups that all look quite similar and not too appetising, in my eyes.   My partner got the lunch ramen bowl which had a very tasty broth but literally had 2 super thin slices of pork lunch meat. I got a mish- mash of items to share with my daughter. She ate well but overall quite an expensive meal for not so outstanding flavours or food.   In general I would say pretty run of the mill Japanese.

I double checked that it was vegetarian and was told 'it depends how vegetarian you are'. Upon further questioning I discovered that the soup contains fish stock. Seeing as I'm allergic to fish, it matters quite a bit and I'd expect this to have been marked on the menu or told to people when they ordered it.

Because it's got little candles on the table and a violinist being screechy next to your ear? Nope: it has cold dead fish. And that happens to be just how I like it.  Now gather 'round kids, I'm picky about my sushi. Having lived in California and having had the pleasure of dining on sashimi hanging from palm-trees, I'm forever lusting after it. So, when the cravings reach such a level that even five minutes of gentle weeping into my Special Meditation Pillow didn't help: I haul ass to Tang.  Oh, wow, yes, please, MOAR. It's expensive, yes, but that's sushi for you, at least here in the UK. And I'd rather pay through the nose for some quality cold dead fish, than having to dodge a slimy piece of salmon at Bonsai (review pending, buckle your seatbelts.)  Look, sushi is all about ingredients, you can't hide anything when you've got raw fish, a little vinegar and rice to present. Tang understands this thank the unholy spaghetti-monster that it does. Just thinking about their salmon sushi makes my eyes glaze over ever so slightly.   The atmosphere is lovely, I never feel rushed, the waiting staff is polite and doesn't hover (when I'm playing at being a vacuum with my freshly prepared plate of sushi I'd rather not have anyone stare at me with judgy little eyes, thank you) and the prices, though pretty high, are understandable for the quality you get here.   I love Tang. I'm going to climb Arthur's Seat and gently hum my appreciation in their direction, that's how much I love Tang. Then I'm going to pick up the phone and make a reservation.",

We ordered plenty of the pork gyoza's to get us going which were very good and tasty and went down well.  Maki and sushi dishes were also tasty, fresh and appetising. It was the main dishes that disappointed - chicken katsu curry was lacking in flavour and was served only just warm, noodle dishes were also disappointing and tasted like bad take away chow mien. Soft shell crab was crisp and cooked well but had no flavour or seasoning. We had 2 bottles of wine and 1 bottle of champagne which was good and reasonably priced and the total bill for our table was just over 200 so affordable between the 6 of us. I'd go back for the gyoza's but that's about it. I'm afraid I wasn't Tang-tilised!",

The tonkotsu ramen will set you back 14 (same with the other ramen dishes too) and despite the premium price, the broth has been diluted with water too so don't expect to have a thick soup base for your ramen. Service is extremely slow and you aren't served by the order in which you enter the restaurant, so don't be shocked if the table that comes in 20 minutes after you gets their bowl of ramen first. Unorganised and dissatisfied dining experience. You'd be better off going elsewhere... anywhere.",

    "text": "My boyfriend dragged me into this restaurant with the promise that Japanese food wasn't all about fish. He was right! I actually thought at least half of the menu involved duck, chicken and beef. I had plenty to choose from and if we'd had more time I would have suggested a banquet of small things to share and experience. The soy paper veg sushi sounded intriguing. As it turned out we only had about 45 mins before our 'late night at the museum' started and they were more than happy to speed things up for us. I opted for chicken teriyaki which was delicious. It had a barbecued flame grilled flavour. Sweet but not overpoweringly so. I ate the majority of it and didn't feel overly full. The pork dumpling we shared were very tasty also.  The only annoyance was the shoogly table Something I thought I'd never say about a Japanese restaurant - Would go back! :)",

Unfortunately I live in the UK, a.k.a. the land of bad Japanese food. Besides the excellent St. Sushi in Newcastle, I have found Japanese food to be abysmal in these fair lands. ALAS! Tang's is a beacon of hope. We wanted to get a full tour of their offerings, so we got sushi, 'tapas' small plates, and ramen. HELLO RAMEN. Lord, I have been missing ramen in my life. The pork belly ramen, with its delicious meat and deep, rich broth is the stuff that dreams are made of. Small plates, including tako (octopus) balls and mackerel were also quite good. Sushi was fairly good, but not excellent. Will have to give it all a second go. So glad to know Tang's exists. Now have an easy place to run when the Japanese cravings get overwhelming!",

    "text": "We didn't intend to eat at Tang's.  Our first choice was closed for a summer holiday. We were hungry.  The car was in a good parking spot.  We didn't want stodgy comfort food, we didn't want to wait for a table - suddenly we remembered we were near Tang's.  We had been once before, last year during the Fringe Festival.  Once again, we went because it was in the right place at the right time.  The food was 'OK' but during the Fringe they had a condensed menu and we thought the prices may also have been adjusted for the Fringe Frenzy.    With no other options coming to mind, we wandered along to give the full menu a try.  It was fairly busy so we took a small table downstairs.  It was a bit like being in a hallway and lacked atmosphere, but to be honest, I don't remember the upstairs being much 'cosier'.  It was nice to see the full menu and we had plenty to choose from.  We love to 'nibble' so we got lots of small plates.  Nigiri, Maki, prawn tempura, gyoza.   Service was slow and I think most of the staff was taking care of the busier upstairs.  Every now and again a plate or 2 of our order turned up.  We weren't given small plates to eat from and the server disappeared - we were too hungry to wait so we rearranged things so we could each have one of the food plates, which we held on to for the rest of the evening.  Overall the food was pretty good - most above average although I was disappointed with the prawn tempura - the prawn was overcooked and the batter was minimal and a bit tough.  I prefer flaky batter with lots of odd shaped, crispy, wispy bits.  The gyoza dumplings were very good - the filling was substantial, not just mushy puree like some other places - you could tell what you were eating (veggie or pork).    The star of the night was the peking duck ISO.  A large portion, beautifully presented and so tasty!    The surprise of the night was the bill.    82 for 2 people.  No main meals and only bottled water to drink.  Yes, the food was nice, but the service and the atmosphere didn't put Tang's into the high-end category that this price suggested.  Nicer plates, even some rests for your chopsticks would help raise it to the next level.  Next time I want to spend that for sushi I'll head to Kanpai.  This was further put into perspective when I got the credit card statement.   I had to laugh when I saw just below our meal at Tang's was a meal we had at a Michelin quality restaurant in France - 4 courses and wine, 65.  Vive le France!",
