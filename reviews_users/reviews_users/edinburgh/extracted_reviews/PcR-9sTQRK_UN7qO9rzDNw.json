It doesn't stick out as being anything new or all that exciting but it's certainly an inoffensive place to sit and have some drinks and the seats are very comfy too. I've come here quite a few times for a catch up with friends and seeing as two of my closest friends live not too far from here the location is ideal and it's always our bar of choice.  It's not just a bar, you can also order food and although I've never eaten here (I've always opted to go straight for the beverages), I have noticed other customers dining and the food and menu looks pretty tasty.  Overall, if you're looking for a bite to eat and some drinks then Biblos gets a thumbs up from me!",

It's orientated towards being a modern pub-come-restaurant and the decor suits the overall atmosphere which is relaxed and welcoming. My main complaint with Biblos, as with many others, is with the service.  I came here with my sister and we were directed to a table upstairs where we chose what we wanted from the menu.  After about half an hour of waiting and chatting, however, nobody had come to take our order.  Eventually we just headed downstairs and got a new table where we were finally served.  This is indicative of the service in general which just feels blunt and indifferent. The menu offers a varied selection of food from different types of nachos to sausage and mash.  The food is good but it costs more than I would have expected for a place which markets itself to students.  Biblos serves decent food but the price and quality of the service will probably make you wonder if it's worth it.",

Their food is good too - their menu features such treats as nachos, burgers and balmoral chicken! Depending on your appetite you can have small or large portions. I can highly recommend the chicken nachos - but ask for n jalepenos o if you don't like them! They have a great discount if you have a SR card - buy one get one free - and when big events such as X factor and britains Got Talent are on you can watch them here - just make sure you don't sit behind a pillar!",

When the waitress finally brought our food after almost an hour, she dropped my caesar salad straight into my lap. Although the replacement did arrive much quicker than the original, they didn't take anything off the bill, or give me a free drink or anything.  The food wasn't worth waiting for, either. The bun that my friend's burger came in was so stale I'm fairly sure it would have smashed straight through the floor if the waitress had dropped that too. I actually found out afterwards that Biblos was fined 2000 last November for breaching hygiene regulations - I didn't believe it at first but a google search quickly proved that it is True!  I'd like to say it's still an ok place to go for drinks, but this is one of only two places in my life where I've complained about how warm the white wine is, so I don't think I'd even suggest that.  The drinks are cheap though, and the decor is beautiful, although that's probably just to distract your attention from what you're eating and drinking.",

I had an amazing dish of chicken stuffed with haggis (called the Flying Scotsman I believe) and it was delicious, even though I don't really like haggis. It was served with some gorgeous mashed potato with very fancy sounding truffle oil but it tasted like mashed potato of the regular variety to me! Still yummy though!

It was quite chilly inside, every time the door was opened the cold air swam in and then it would warm up a bit then the door would be opened again, so they could do with cranking the heating up. The staff are not overly friendly but despite a few negatives I will certainly go back.

My feeling is that it's a student bar/restaurant that wants to be close to the university but have a 'George Street' feel to it.  I've come here for the odd, decent enough coffee and eaten here once or twice. I'm reasonably indifferent to it but last night my burger and chips got me thinking that maybe I should warn people.   Warning: Don't order a burger unless you really like black pepper. Like, reeeaaallly like black pepper. Like, really. Seriously, I almost broke my 'no wasting food ever' rule for this but I hadn't eaten in hours and someone else was paying so politeness and starvation took over. The haggis balls are OK though.  Apart from that, Biblos has a fairly swanky looking decor and staff that smile and take care of you. It's never full midweek so there's always a table and at weekends the crowd is friendly but not overly so.  They do 25% off food deals occasionally and decent Snapfax deals too. I imagine they cater well to groups who might be looking to head out to a club after.",

The service was intermittent and fairly dismal.. The food was mediocre and  really didn't leave much of an impression (not a good one at least).. two salads at the table arrived \"undressed\" and upon inquiry were told that the kitchen had \"run out of the balsamic vinaigrette\" which usually came on the salad. We (maybe rather loudly) suggested that maybe someone run to the Tesco across the road to pick up our own salad dressing! A bottle of balsamic vinegar soon arrived at the table and free drinks were offered as compensation for the those who'd ordered salad. Two steaks at the table looked promising upon arrival but the rare was closer to well done although the medium rare was at least about medium.  Dessert/tea or coffee was never offered after our plates were cleared away, we had to send someone to get the bill for our table. The vague saving grace was that they gave us 30% off our entire food bill because we had a few students at the table. (They offer a 30% student discount).  I think we all left feeling rather underwhelmed. With so many options for eating out in Edinburgh, Biblos does not warrant a repeat visit.",

One door, which I believe has remained unfixed for the last year, doesn't work, so watch out for that! As you walk in, there's the bar area which is followed by the seating area.

In my first years of uni here, Biblos rapidly rose to being one of my favourite places to eat.  This was no doubt helped by the two for one deal on main courses - on one occasion, I ordered two main courses for myself!  The food has been great each time I've been, and I wasn't aware of these apparent health issues there.  It's something I'll bear in mind if I go there again.  The one thing that does annoy me each time is the poor service.  This has prevented Biblos from scoring any higher than 2 stars in my reckoning.  Each time I have been, the waiting staff have not been to the standard I would expect.  They have either been too busy behind the bar, or overstretched by the amount of orders to take and food to serve.  It was quite often the case that food would take an hour to arrive, or longer on occasion.  This was repeatedly frustrating to me, and means that my desire to go back there again is now tempered.  On the flip side, the decoration inside is very nice, and so if you are content to look at the surroundings whilst waiting for your food, you may be able to cope.",

You may think that a salad would hardly be filling - it really is! However, they also offer a large selection of burgers,nachos and other favourite pub mains to choose from and their glasses of wine are more like half a bottle of wine in a wine glass. It's got a small balcony on the top which you book for an event as well.   I would say its more like a place to start your night from, rather than focus your night on. It's in close proximity to the touristy Grassmarket (which has a few clubs) and next door to the Jazz Bar and Brass Monkey.",

It serves your typical pub food of Nachos, Caesar Salad, Burgers, Fish and Chips etc. I have a friend who insists on going to Biblos for the Nachos whenever she comes to Edinburgh. I'm not sure they are the best in Edinburgh, but they are pretty good. I usually go for a Caesar Salad, which is as good as a Caesar Salad should be. I have often admired companions burgers too.   If your heading for a night in the Grassmarket or Cowgate, Biblos is an ideal starting point for something to line your stomach with and have a drink or two.",

Service was good and just shy of intrusive up till it came time to pay the bill at which point the staff were nowhere to be seen so we had to hover at the bar to settle up. My gnocchi starter was tasty although there was rather too much tomato sauce, the tuna steak main course was also good but could have done with a potato or two as spinach as the main veg accompaniment was a little bit boring. Only one Rose on the menu but at 11.50 it was as well priced as it was drinkable (a Fair Trade product to boot).   A good selection of tunes at a comfortable volume further enhanced the experience & I can see myself venturing back here.",

Look if you want a good burger and fries, skip Biblos and head up the street to Mums, and if you want a good coffee, the cafe across the road from them -though smaller- serves far better brew, but if you don't care and just want to be left alone, sit in at Biblos, I promise you, it will be quite ... forgettable.",

Yes, I'm aware that sounds extremely lazy, but when you invest in a pair of Kurt Geiger skyscraping heels, the proximity of bus stops to bars and walking distance become an issue. I know I've probably now lost any male readership I had at the start of ths review by using the word heels and proceeding to sound like a female stereotype, but if you've got a girlfriend who consistently whinges about how far they have to walk to get somewhere when they're wearing heels, this information could be to your advantage.  Biblos is pretty spacious, being on two floors, with comfortable seating to lounge about in if you so wish. I always think everything is just fine in here, but that as a bar it lacks in atmosphere a little bit. I favour coming in here during the day for lunch or a coffee, as I feel it works better vibe-wise then. The nachos are a reliably good call, but the rest of the menu is equally crowd pleasing, so you shouldn't have any trouble finding at least one thing you're keen to order.",

The instant we walked in, we were given a nice seat by the window, THAT would have been what I asked for, for we both like to people watch!   DH ordered the soup of the day, which was a creamy carrot and coriander. I had a roasted red pepper salad with feta cheese and spinach. These dishes were excellent and we shared them between us. We both also ordered fish and chips. The meals came with cooked peas. The fish was nicely battered and tasted great. It was, however very hot and we had to wait a while to eat it. The chips were perfectly fried.   Service was good the entire meal. The only oddity was that the restrooms were downstairs via a triple staircase and I was tired by the time I got back. (I was already walking 10,000 steps, and this over 60 body of mine is mainly had had it! If it was during the summer, and we stopped by to 'relax and enjoy a meal and get out of the heat, I would have barked for hiking up those steps!)",

Following an early morning visit to the National Museum of Scotland on a Tuesday, I was desperate for some food, having eaten nothing all day. A sandwich board outside Biblos, just steps from the museum, advertised 7.99 two-course lunches, so why not? A welcoming, well-lit restaurant and nice staff were additional plusses.  I got the calamari starter and fish and chips, plus a bottled cider. Good, if not great food and I dare you to find a better deal in this area. Drink prices equivalent to Glasgow city centre, so perfectly reasonable for being smack dab in the middle of usually touristy Edinburgh. Would I come for dinner? Possibly. The evening menu options look elevated and they offer deals at $12.95 for two courses and 14.95 for three.",

    "text": "Biblos, as Ian A so rightly points out, is the kind of place you walk past a bajillion times before you actually realise you should probably check it out. I walked past it on a twice daily basis for the best part of a year (I was going somewhere, I should add - I wasn't just walking past to gaze in longingly) and now, long after I stopped walking past it, the opportunity arose as we hunted a post-show drink. Watching ice-dancing is enthralling but also you leave the performance feeling like you've been holding your breath for two hours straight and now seriously need to relax.  So we sauntered to the nearby Biblos. What to say, what to say. There was a sign on the wall saying that the upstairs space was reserved, but on asking it apparently wasn't, so we went up. It has a nice interior and I was very comfortable, and I even actually took my actual coat off. Yes, the Lizard Woman was warm enough!  But on the down side, it took a long time for anyone to come and take our order (oh he came around to gather up and whisk away the food menus, and when we said \"we would like to order some drinks\" he just waved the menus at us as though to say \"Not my division. I'm on gathering duty right now.\"  When we did order, it took a fair while to come. Now then, there were really not that many of us - seven if I recall correctly - and most of the upstairs was empty, so why it should take so long to concoct our round (which included a lime and soda and a diet Coke; not the most challenging) is a mystery. The arrival itself was also slightly confused and flustered.  Nevertheless, it's well located and comfortable, so it's far from being a write off. Ditch the TV (look, I love the IT Crowd, but seriously, what is the point of showing a sitcom with no sound? Football, yes, snooker, fine, but something that relies on dialogue?), whip up the service a bit, and they could have a real winner here. I worry that the good location excuses a little laziness; not for me it doesn't.",

Apparently there is table service, but it took the waiters some time to ask us for our choices. Even then, it took them longer than expected to bring the drinks to us. Seriously, it is not that I am normally complaining, but considering that this place was pretty much empty it just astonishes me how long it took to get drinks.  I believe that the kitchen finishes at 22.00. They do student frink and food discounts, which are good offers indeed.  The interior itself is quite modern with TVs on the walls and a bar being the centre piece. The cocktail prices are feasible and the menu offers the main cocktails like you normally get (eg Manhattan or Mojito). Still, I think that the soft drink prices are a bit dear.   Sadly, this place is lacking on atmosphere for me, but for students it definitely should have a certain appeal.",

    "text": "Biblos is the kind of place that you walk past all the time, never having any inclination of entering, but then somehow end up there. There is nothing particularly appealing about Biblos from the outside. We are always on the hunt for wifi, and Biblos unabashedly welcomed us inside, albeit desperately and in the absence of any hint of self-respect (see: Budweiser tattoo above door).  Upon entering, we sat in what was undoubtedly the sole appealing aesthetic of the place: a cozy library-esque nook with big armchairs and shelves lined with books. Maybe they could have pulled off that kind of atmosphere if it weren't for the abrasive lighting and large flat screen television mounted directly above the Charles Dickens novels. This place might have -- maybe -- appeared hip and progressive circa 2002. As you sit there, numbly staring at the large posters obstructing what would otherwise be an interesting window view of Nicolson Street, and another one of the least memorable (and rightly so) hits of the early millennium rolls on without hesitation, you may find yourself wondering what life choices you have made to predestine your visit to this establishment.   \"Hey guys, look! All food 25% off! What could go wrong!\" you might say. Nothing weird about that, right? We got the nachos and the restaurant's eponymous salad. The nachos were sloppily thrown together, with globs of guacamole, sour cream, and what they referred to as salsa clumped into the center of the chips, although I can't say they tasted terrible - but then again, what can go wrong with cheese and chips. At least we cleared the whole plate. The same sadly cannot be said for the Biblos salad.   As for the drinks, they were the most acceptable aspect of Biblos we saw on that fateful evening. We got a Pina Colada and a Dark 'n' Stormy, both of which were decent (don't get excited). One upside: if you have a student ID, there are quite a few discounts on drinks, and both were of reasonable size considering the mere 3.70 we had to shell out.  Ultimately, I guess you get what you pay for at Biblos, and I mean that in a bad way. There are deals to be had here, but best to spend your money elsewhere.",

    "text": "In a word? Grim.   I used to visit Biblos a lot when I was a student based on Chambers Street, but my latest visit as a fully fledged worker drone has coloured my experience differently.   I came for my dinner before a visit to the museum, and boy was I disappointed. I ordered the fish and chips first of all. It arrived and the fish was in a soggy batter (urgh) and the chips were a soggy-fest too.   Determined to cheer myself up after a less than average fish and chips, I ordered a banoffee pie for dessert. Worst pudding ever. The plate arrived with a cheeky squirt of cheap skooshy cream covering the \"banoffee pie\" (see image). By all accounts, it should have been billed as \"cheap digestive square base with tinned toffee sauce and three slices of banana on top\". It was so bad.   Do not eat here. Even though the place knocked 30% off the bill due to an offer, it was still a tenner wasted. As for drinks, couldn't comment. But the food? Like I said earlier... Grim.",

The decor is dark and depressing, the staff seemed dazed and confused and miserable as sin, the food was bland and the atmosphere unpleasant!  Sorry guys but I don't rate it highly!",

    "text": "I had Biblos with a large group of classmates (Around 30 of us) at the end of a very intense week of study. Glad to report that Biblos was a great choice to end such a wonderful week.  Biblo is a pretty large restaurant, it has 1 and a half floors, we took the \"half floor\" upstairs as the place was already packed downstairs.  With music in the background and its dimly lit ambiance, it has a fine-dining feel to it but its prices, while high, isn't outrageous. (Psst, I also heard that they have student discounts if you have your student ID with you)  A huge selection of food, all of which, sounds interesting. All of us had a hard time deciding. The poor staff had to keep coming back to us as we indecisively looked through the menu over and over again.  The staff were very friendly. When our professors needed to make some final announcements, the staff were kind enough to temporarily turn down the music until we were done.  The portions of food is rather large and it tasted great!   I'd say it is a good place for groups!",
