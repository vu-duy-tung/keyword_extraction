    "text": "Nearing the end of a long day shopping, I found myself up the \"High Street\" totally famished & praying for food!!. I could eat a horse I thought, sadly or gladly though there were no horses in sight so I would settle for a pizza hut. To my horror I was told it would be a wait of approx 20 mins before I even got a table in the hut.  I decide to head back to Princess St, before reaching my destination though I see the sign \"YUM YUM\". My first thoughts were, \"Food, Ya Beauty\" my prayers have been answered. Then my thoughts changed to, \"Dingy back street, MRSA, E-Coli etc\"... My stomach ruled my head. I went in. The chef,the cook,the cashier & the assistant were all really nice.( It was all the same guy but he had that many rolls to play)!  I played it safe and asked for chips & cheese. Whilst waiting I got a chance to speak to the waiter,(another of his many hats), he explained that he was Kurdish & had worked in Edinburgh for 8 years. After just a few chips I felt adventurous, so decided to have another of his many meals. I opted for,\" \"CHETTINAD CHICKEN\". A curry from Tamilnadu in South India,so I was informed. The curry was quite fiery but the taste was out of this world. At only 5.30 for the curry I felt like I had hit the jackpot. As I was concentrating more on eating my chips, my curry was put into a take-away container.. Curry, Chips n Cheese, 2 cans of Coke for under a Tenner.. Superb.. Next time I am out in town it will be one of my first stops.",

    "text": "Good lamb shaorma wrap. According to my hostel I was supposed to get a discount, but the cashier didn't have a specific discount in mind. He offered to lower the price by 80p, bringing the order to 5. That always seemed sketchy to me, but I accepted. After he made it, he couldn't remember what he told me before, or what I was paying him (a 10 note). Luckily this didn't cause any conflicts, but I was still on edge. Plus, the whole place seemed run-down and dirty. Funny how a place so close to Grassmarket tourism can be so sketchy. Not recommended for sit-in after dark, and I probably won't be returning.",

    "text": "Fleshmarket Close can get a bit hairy during weekend evenings. It's littered with broken bottles, and the notorious alcove near the top is given over to chancers brandishing cans of Kestrel, which leads to streams of unidentifiable liquid pouring down the steps. It's not pretty.   Such a realist's slice of after-hours life requires a grubby kebab shop to complete the picture, and that's where Yum Yum comes in. It' not donner at the level of Palmyra, but still a good bit better than some of the stinking offal you'll find peddled at 3am elsewhere. The usual burgers and pizzas round off a pretty competent option for a late-night nosh up.",
