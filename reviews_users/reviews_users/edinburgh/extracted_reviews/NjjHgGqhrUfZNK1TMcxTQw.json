The Caesar salad was a regular mixed salad with what tasted like Asda creamy italian dressing.  No anchovies. The pasta dish - tagliatelle centro was a mess.  An overpowering burnt taste.  A really strange consistency to the sauce, and over cooked pasta. It was just bad.  And the decor (or lack thereof) - boxes on the floor, refrigerators and other appliances sitting out in the open.  The patio out back which actually looked nice was closed.  There was only one other table during our dinner and now I know why.  I don't like to give bad reviews but this was such a horrible experience.  If you're looking for italian food - keep on walking.",

Came in for a take away seeing as it was the only place open for coffee and I seriously needed a caffeine fix.  Had a macchiato which was rocket fuel strong just how I like it.  Bought a couple pastries to take home but they were rather stale and unappealing.  Good coffee but not so good baked items.  Counter service was kind of cold and aloof for this typically friendly city but prices are reasonable.  Good for coffee and I would like to come back to try the Italian fare an update my review.",

Till there everything is ok. But when you start yelling at your customers, why they sat at the restaurant part without asking them, what they would like to eat/drink: than this is not ok. Not only thar we were moved to a different table at the cafe part, the service was horrible.  First of all, the coffee was ok (i need to be fair), but the cakes where tooo swear. And I mean really sswear, that you can't eat the hole slice, as you start feeling, that youre bloodsugar level goes higher and higher. And the the italian lady owner asked us, at the half of our cups  if we are leaving.  What a wonderful service isn't it? If you want to be yelled and aant to eat just sugar, instead of a nice slice of cake, then this is your place.",

So, girding my loins, I set off and was rewarded with the best pancakes yet.  I only wish they had more variety of batter and toppings. But this is an Italian cafe and not IHoP so that can be forgiven.  They also do a mutha*quack*ing Breakfast Calzone.  I WILL BE BACK FOR YOU BREAKFAST CALZONE!",

    "text": "Caffe Centro is a very nice Italian cafe on George Street. It is often packed on lunch time, which is no surprise since their food is pretty good. You can get anything from soups, sandwiches and salads to pastas and pizzas. Or if you are an early bird you can get a good breafast as well.  However, I had my eyes set on some dessert as I had just had lunch elsewhere. I wanted to cry from delight as I scanned their dessert menu when I saw that banana split was on the menu. I love it, it's simple but delicious IF done correctly. N.B. there are some establishments in Edinburgh that include canned fruit in banana split which is just wrong, wrong, wrong... I am glad to confirm that Caffe Centro knows how to do a banana split properly. My bowl consisted of banana, vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and a drizzle of chocolate sauce (see picture). That's all that is needed. And it was amazing :)  Next time I might try one of their other desserts as there was plenty of choice.",

    "text": "Mmnnnn... In reading everyone else's review I don't know if I'm being harsh or not but I'm not a fan of this place. I've been in a couple of times recently. Once for coffee and cake which was an \"ok\" experience. Central location, but there are so many other nicer places nearby you can go for a fabulous coffee in a nicer setting. Plus I found the squoosh of canned cream next to my bit of lemon drizzle cake a bit cheap and it coloured my perception of their Italian home baking.  Next visit was for food during the festival, primarily cause we walked past and the folk I was with said we should go in as they couldn't be bothered trying to find anywhere else that would take 6. It wouldn't have ever been on my list of places to eat Italian food in Edinburgh however I'm happy to go with the flow on occasion as I'm hoping to be surprised. I wasn't. Pasta was overcooked (an offence in Italy!!) and the sauce wasn't all that. Weird tasting meatballs, kinda tasted like they were frozen from Costco. Nothing authentic about this place in my mind apart from the Italian waiter. The place had a slightly grubby look to it which might have been down to the huge amount of tourist traffic in and out for the festival, but still... No toilet paper in the ladies either. Grump.   So cannot recommend. But as I say, I might just be more harsh than others :)",

Being well before lunchtime, I was only after a coffee, so made my way to a comfy looking table to check Yelp reviews on this Italian styled eatery.  On reading Tanja's quotes on the heavenly pancakes I was hooked, so placed an order. Looking around the caffe it has a distinct European quality about it, clean well presented seating and staff very friendly good. A short time later...Oh my, you need to go and try the combo of pancakes (yes six small ones), maple syrup, honey, fresh cream were solidly devine, and mouth meltingly good, Thanks Tanja.  As I gazed around, on the walls hung street scene pictures of some cosmopolitan city, And looking around the caffe it almost has a distinct European quality about it clean, well presented seating and staff very friendly.  My new found spring clean is to try as many green teas in as many places as possible the city can offer me in a week. That really got off to a great start at Brew Lab, the presentation of fresh looking leaves in a transparent pot, but here was a small portion of tea in a bag. I suppose you can't have it both ways - great food, hmm not so good tea.  Challenge accepted...but I need to check other reviews first.",

The first time was for a coffee and snack a few months' ago after shopping, and that was great- good coffee and excellent value panini with salad etc. Service is quick and friendly.   The second was for dinner, and we weren't too impressed. We ordered the olive appetiser expecting some of those nice herby olives in oil you usually get, but what turned up was the cheapest possible olives from brine on iceberg lettuce- not impressed. We both had pizza for mains, but they were nowhere near as nice as you'd get in other places in Edinburgh- for example Prezzo or even Pizza Express. Mine had tons of cheese, but little in the way of tasty herbs etc, and the other was apparently disappointing as well. Desserts were pretty good- I had the lemon sorbet.   So- good for a stop and a nibble, not so good for an evening out.",

    "text": "Strangely overlooked on George Street, this little cafe cum Italian restaurant is a gem. I think it is under new management, as the staff definitely aren't as friendly as before, but it still has a good little atmosphere. I have popped in for both a quick coffee and a pastry (which are excellent by the way) and for a full meal and have to say I have been impressed with both.  The staff are lovely (less so now but I might have just caught them on a bad day) and immediately make you feel really at home. The menu is pretty standard Italian, but the quality of food is excellent. Feeling a bit like Jeff Vader I went for the Penne Arrabbiatta which was really good. Normally I don't go for pasta and tomato-y sauces because I feel like I can make them at home, but I couldn't face a pizza, and this was really flavoursome. I have had the pizzas other times, and the buffalo mozzarella is great on them; I had the Calabrese, which was also really good.  The prices are quite pricey, (about 9 for pasta and pasta on average) but the food is really good and it is in the centre of George Street to be fair. Because of this it can be a bit too busy, as it is not very big it fills up quickly so make sure you get in early. Apart from that though it is one of the better Italian restaurants in the centre of town",
