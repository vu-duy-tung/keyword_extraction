Super milky deliciousness with a spice of nutmeg and sweet dreams.  The bar is a really cool place with funky decor. Also it's a venue during the fringe so a nice place for a show. Not to mention the Ninja Buns! Delicious! A must try there must try.  So overall a great place that perhaps it's downfall is how popular it can get.",

Its even better when the food is actually good and it's really good here.   I'm a big fan of BBQ ribs and what used to be impossible to get anywhere in Edinburgh seems to be de rigueur at the moment but the ones in here are brilliant.   Today I had a nice pint of Estrella and some chipotle macaroni outside in the sun on my lunch break (all served in good time for work lunches)  The place itself is quirky and thankfully different from all these new minimalist places popping up that are stripped to the bare bricks and steel girders. That was done 10 years ago in London man...",

    "text": "I really really really liked Paradise Palms.   The Man and I came here on a recent wee day out, after I read about their famous Ninja Buns. We were fortunate to arrive early as they really filled up for lunch, which actually quite surprised me. The Man got a bloody mary which properly impressed him. That appreciation grew when the bartender popped by to see if he was enjoying his drink, and went on to explain the bazillions of ingredients which are lovingly muddled into and strained out of the drink to give it a very unique, spicy and tangy flavour.   For our lunch, The Man got the fish finger ninja buns and I chose pulled pork. I opted for the lunch special (with fries and coleslaw) so we could share the sides. On the one hand, I was surprised that a teeeeeny tiny pot of coleslaw was 1, but on the other hand it was proper good coleslaw (with a satay-like sauce) and frankly, the 6.50 price tag for the whole meal is actually a comparatively decent deal for lunch in Edinburgh these days. The bun alone is 4.50. It seems small but is so full of flavour that we both left entirely satisfied (and with room for ice cream, which is always important).  I'm quite desperate to try the cocktail list, so will have to return to partake in that.  In addition to enjoying the food and drinks, we thought the staff were brilliant. They were incredibly friendly and you could tell that they all believed in their product and enjoyed what they do.  I had mixed feelings about the \"dive bar\" label - on the one hand it's refreshing to not have the whole wood/metal/tungsten light look, but on the other hand it feels weird to me to create a dive bar. For me, a dive should happen naturally instead of be created. Having said that though, the setting didn't actually feel terribly contrived.  I would absolutely return both for lunch, and hopefully next time for cocktails too!",

Good news is that Paradise is doing an all veggie/vegan menu, however, now they are just testing it with a bean burger. They were very open about feedback as it was testing, but the quality of the food was just not there. The burger was dry and overcooked and the fries were not crispy nor tasty. I am so sad for this place and know its food will evolve, but a fair warning to all, it is now mainly a bar and not the home of Ninja buns.",

The service was really good--we got our water refilled periodically and were checked on quite often.  The menu was fun and American--not something we were particularly craving since we were visiting from the U.S., but it was still nice to have 100% vegetarian options.  I got the \"hot dog\" and buffalo cauliflower while my friend got the chile.  Both were tasty and filling.  I give props to whomever made the buffalo cauliflower--the sauce was spot on, and the ranch, although different from what we're used to in the U.S., was extremely tasty.  The food here was very reasonably priced as well.  I wish we'd been able to come back for some of their fun drinks as the environment was amazing.  If I'm ever back in Edinburgh, which I'm sure I'll be, I'll be sure to stop in again!",

We had a couple of mains and starters to share, the chilli, a hotdog, and some mixed tempura, and it's fair to say everything was excellent.  I was slightly unsure of the Jackfruit options to start with but they were very enjoyable. The chilli bowl especially was more-ish and the corn bread tasty.

It's a very cool place to walk in to- wacky decorations adorn all the walls, making you feel like you're in a technicolor jungle. The staff are hip and friendly, and the menu is a fascinating vegetarian take on a British take on food from the southern USA.   However, the service is slow, the prices are high, and the food is... just not that good. The first time I went I had a black bean burger and was very underwhelmed by the soggy, tasteless creation they offered me. The second time was significantly better, as I ordered the jackfruit \"crabcake\" - a tasty fried pattie of veggies and fruit with a bit of spice.   The vegan/vegetarian emphasis is deeply appreciated, but I just wish the operation was a little more put together. Maybe I'm missing something.",

It's cozy, camp and kitsch inside - which is pretty much everything I'm looking for in a dive bar. They've got a very good and rather unique cocktail list (I didn't dare try the Buckfast Daiquiri). The Lady Garden is like a jazzed up G&T (my go-to choice) and was as delicious as the name was amusing - there was lots of immature giggling at our table. Prices for drinks didn't seem too bad, and I really fancied the idea of the ninja buns, but we ate before we came. Having seen the reviews about their miniscule size, this might have been a lucky break?  They were setting up for a science lecture as we left, and if I hadn't had plans I would definitely stayed for that. Looking at their schedule of events already has me filling up my diary to next year. I hope to return many times and update this review in the future, but yes - Paradise Palms is a hit!",

I ordered a delicious sound basil and peanut chicken bun, and was disappointed to say the least when it was a few mouthfuls.

One part dive bar, one part vegan food haven, PP is easy to miss, but you ARE SO GLAD you found it once you do.   The place is quirky. The people are quirky. The food is quirky. It is my go-to spot for vegan food and Im not even a vegan. This isnt your ordinary vegan food either: BBQ jackfruit, cauliflower buffalo bites, banoffee pie among tons of other rotating specials. Everything is good, everything is quality. It isnt the type of place you want to come if you are in a lunch rush, but if you have some time to sit back, relax, and enjoy it is well worth it.",

    "text": "2 fun facts about me: I love Hawaii... And I LOVE dive bars!! I'm summery, Paradise Palms is my favourite bar in the whole of Edinburgh... And I like me some bars!  The bar is busting full of awesome decor and Hawaiian shirts, the staff are ludicrously friendly and a lot of fun, plus the food is incredible and really affordable. And don't even get me started on their boozy selection. Five of your finest Scottish pounds will get you the best cocktail in the country: A Buckfast Daiquiri. Seriously, this is so many levels of 'so wrong it's right' I don't even know where to start. Don't judge em till you try em!  I've been to a lot of birthdays and leaving dos here and we've always had a total blast. When I was looking for somewhere to throw an Etsy Craft Party, Paradise Palms was on the top of my wish list. They were super helpful and let us rearrange the furniture to fit over 20 people in for a big ole craft-a-thon. I'm really pleased to share it was a total hit!  They even let me in behind the bar when I was doing a shoot for my blog. That's a lot of trust and support right there, and the photos turned out beautifully ;)   Top Tips: They have a mini record shop inside and even sell vintage Hawaiian shirts! They also have loads of fun events on (including Drag nights!) and even host a monthly Bar Boothsale, which is like a Car Bootsale only with cool stuff and ... A BAR  ;)  be sure to check out their Facebook page so you don't miss out on anything, or you'll regret it!",

    "text": "I like Paradise Palms a lot, but I only ever seem to end up there during the festival. As a student I used to frequent its predecessors, and I mourn the loss of their very cheap meal deals. But I haven't been a student for over five years, and I live in Leith now, so... I'm not mourning too hard.  Anyway! Last year during the Fringe they had some visiting bar staff from London, who were not only great chat but also plied us with customised cocktails. Definitely a thumbs up from me.  Last night, we headed here for food, as I was a few beers in and keen to finally try Ninja Buns.  I'd read Paddy's review, so knew that they wouldn't be big, but jings, they are tiny. Properly tiny. Delicious, but itsy bitsy teeny weeny. I went for the chicken and tequila one, which mostly tasted of coriander.  I happen to really like coriander, but I know it's a divisive one, so I'm just putting that out as a PSA.  I topped it up with 'Asian' slaw and chilli and garlic fries, which were pretty good.  I also fell in love. With a cocktail. To be specific, I fell in love with the Filthy Martini. I am a huge fan of salty and sour flavours, I mean, you should see the amount of fish sauce I add when I make Thai food.  And if I open a tin of sardines, I'll eat the lot, brine and everything.  Obviously if you don't like brine, don't order the Filthy Martini.  But I'm very glad I did.  My liver is less glad, but meh, liver schmiver.  There was a bit of a problem with the bill, namely an extra round of cocktails that we hadn't ordered, but that was removed and our Ninja Buns, two cocktails and a beer each came to about 50.  Which was more than I'd really meant to spend, but I got carried away.  Like I said earlier, I'm seldom in the area so Paradise Palms is almost certainly destined to remain an August only thing for me, but it's a definitely worth a visit if you'd rather buy your overpriced food and drink in an actual sit down venue rather than from one of the many street food stalls nearby.",

    "text": "Five stars for friendly service alone.   I stayed above Paradise Palms for a night in the AirBnB that's attached (check it out - very, very nice and stylish). I popped in to get my key and was met by the lovely bar manager who helped my daughter and I up the stairs and invited us to come into the bar at any time. Kids are allowed in until 8pm. If you're familiar with Edinburgh you'll know they have some strange licensing laws.  I had a few things to do but dropped by with my little girl and had a mocktail and icy pole. The music was fun, the decor even more fun and I had a good chat to the staff before my friend arrived for a quick beer. Obviously I can't comment on the food because we are elsewhere but I will be excited to try it when I'm next in Edinburgh.  Friendly service isn't that easy to come by in general. I always appreciate it.",

It takes me far, far away. - On visit one, Pina Colada in hand, I feel like I'm on holiday. The interior is ballsy and cool; Hawaiian shirts, holiday post cards and soft toys stuck lovingly to the ceiling. The lights are dim; the neon is on; the atmosphere is just right. I'm not a loud bar kind of gal but on Friday evening, Paradise Palms made for the perfect stop before home; lively, with a DJ, but not too loud to talk comfortably. - Just the right amount of party.  I love the energy and soul of this place. And they make a mean cocktail!  I've found my safe house. - Make mine a Pina Colada!",

We finally discovered it on our last day of a month at the fringe and we wish we'd known about it sooner. Delicious black bean and seitan burger! Yummy vegan nachos with vegan cheese! Terrific cocktail menu, hip ambience, and super friendly staff.  And a record shop, to boot?! Don't miss this spot.",

    "text": "Even the name of this place is intriguing isn't it? I went there last night with a couple colleagues after work. The restaurant is pretty dark and has numerous random tropical decorations on walls and ceilings.  The plus was the menu offered a good range if vegetarian and vegan options, ideal for my friend. We didn't have to book a table and food was served pretty quickly. Personally I wasn't too sure about my fried halloumi served with Buckfast bbq sauce and cashew mayo, it was OK but part of me expected a bit more from the halloumi. That aside my pals had both nachos and were happy with theirs. I would definitely come back to try the rest of their menu, it was reasonably priced and it is in a handy location next to the meadows and south clerk Street so if you are around there is no harm trying it out.",

The walls are full of random bits and bobs, think a hipster Club Tropicana. Fun and sunshine, there's enough for everyone!   Interesting and tasty cocktails but I couldn't quite bring myself to try the Buckfast Daiquiri! Friendly bar staff too. The live DJs were throwing down some awesome old school tunes that got us all dancing.   A very fun but blurry evening was had by all.  Cheers!",

There are couches in the back that give those who want more privacy all the comfort they need. It can get pretty busy and and the dance nights are great. The music ranges quite a bit but it's usually good dance music. Staff are friendly and they have great deals on drinks. Don't feel like I need to leave. Laaaave Palms",
