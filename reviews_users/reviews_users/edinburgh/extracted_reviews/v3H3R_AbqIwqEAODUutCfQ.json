    "text": "Clock this.  As with their other outlets, the Clock on the Shore is the way to go to score a great Breakfast / Brunch / Lunch. Cheap and great quality ingredients.   The Shore one is brilliantly located in the 'Clock Tower' and this just adds to the feel of authenticity, as if it has always been there.   The staff are always very cheery and polite. During lunchtimes it may get a bit busy so expect a little wait, but they seem to keep their act together.  They also do pre catering orders and take away, but myself I have yet to use these services.  Good business, good spot, good pricing.",

My husband and I got two Highlander breakfasts two coffees and man, that was a lot of food. For 22 we were way too full and left food behind, we should have split the meal instead. But, the food was delicious, and quick considering how much she had to make. If I wasn't here for a short time and wanting to try different places, I'd definitely go to the Clock on a regular basis. The atmosphere was calm but cute and had some good oldies music on.",

Overall, we said: \"The Clock is really pretty smart, continues to be very popular, and is a good lunchtime stop. Its offerings didn't unduly quicken my pulse, but they provided good wholesome fare, and, with the warmth of the welcome, set me on my way with a smile upon my face.\"",

Totally, but that doesn't take away from the fact that I can a) park around the corner quite easily and b) always get a quick lunch here that satisfies my basic hunger  The staff are nice & friendly, but the soup is often flavour-less and the baked potatoes are really hit or miss - quite often I've gotten home to find that my tattie is uncooked in the middle. (I'm an old-fashioned, proper oven-baked to within a \"skin\" of it's life-potato gal).  The wrap & sandwich selection look much better, but I'm not big on bread... perhaps that's where I'm going wrong?!   I would still recommend for a quick grab & run lunch in Leith... and the service has pushed up a 2star to a 3star... I'm nice like that!",

    "text": "Excellent little corner sandwich/soup/coffee shop. They have a great, unique selection of pre-made, fresh sandwiches ready for the go and soup...   I've gone back multiple times simply for the soups, which are in my unbiased opinion some of the best soups I've had in Edinburgh. You can't go wrong with these soups, made fresh from scratch everyday, and always very warmly, wholesome, warm, and tasty. I've tried all of the following and not been disappointed: Leek and Potato, French Onion, Chunky Vegetable, Lentil and Veg, Cauliflower and Veg. Get the soup!  My only complaint is the seating: it's limited to about four or five stools that face the window and one round table with a few chairs around it.   Otherwise, great place for a quick coffee or quality deli sandwich and SOUP. Just keep in mind if you're planning on siting in you may be out of luck when it's busy.",

After tasting a chorizo, Mexican cheese and salsa roll I was unsurprised at the afore mentioned attention.  There's a range of good deli's scattered around Edinburgh, and Clock can be proud to be one of them. The staff are talkative and inviting too.   Top stuff.",

Seeing as we were both new to The Shore, I tried it on the day it opened, enjoyed what they had to offer (top quality meats, huge-mungus amounts of salad, top notch home made cakes and premium fruit juice and other exotic drinks not found at yer local megastore. As a result, it very quickly became my #1 stop for lunch in the Shore area!",

They offer the usual freshly made sandwich concept that most sandwich bars offer but the fillings are particularly good.   The soups are also excellent, they have three different ones on each day and are all freshly made.   The staff are very friendly and always really pleasant when serving you.   The only thing I can fault is the extra cost if you want to sit in and there is no free wi-fi. Other than that, I really recommend this place for lunch.",

But they also serve a fine latte and have a brilliant selection of quirky lunchtime choice on offer, either freshly prepared or lying freshly ready to snatch up and guzzle down in their chiller cabinet. So reasonably regularly, this might include felafel salad boxes, tortilla slices, soup (though not in the chiller cabinet), quiche, all kinds of homemade cakes and sandwiches including my new favourite combining parma ham, mozzarella and rocket.   They also have a fine array of drinks including enough flavoured waters to keep the most discerning and vitamin deficient drinker happy.",
