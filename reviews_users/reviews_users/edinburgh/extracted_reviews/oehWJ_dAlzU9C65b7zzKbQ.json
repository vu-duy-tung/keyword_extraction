    "text": "It was some time ago that I had a meal here...yet I still have a slightly bitter taste in my mouth. Especially after hearing all the amazing things about it.   Considering I had booked an early 5:30 celebratory dinner (had just graduated with a post-grad) and there was only 3 of us, I was pretty disappointed that they couldn't accommodate giving us a window seat (to marvel at the incredible view). I'm a realist I should have requested it sooner so it's my fault. Except the place was empty when we got there. And never mind that we were clearly dressed up and celebrating we were stuck in the corner out of the way tables of an almost completely empty restaurant. You know the bit where the waiters collect from the kitchen. That bit.   No matter because the food and service were clearly going to be amazing right?! Oh wait...service. Was pretty much non existent. After giving us our menus and taking drinks orders we were pretty much left for 20 minutes with our menus to ponder their extensive selections? Sorry if memory serves correctly it was not extensive.   Rights orders taken let's roll on this scrumptious renowned food. Except that wasn't either! What is going on here?! Am I on some joke reality show? No...turns out it was just average. I think my starter was nice enough but I didn't love my main at all. I can't even remember what I had that's how bland and I memorable it was. Let's not mention how our starter plates were not cleared at all when our main was served. Not were our main plates cleared for about 20-25 minutes. I wish I could say I was exaggerating but I actually had to flag someone down ask for a dessert menu and for someone to take our plates away. Basically, we were forgotten about. And having my 6 year old son there with us, to share in such a momentous occasion, seemed like a massive put off and inconvenience to the staff. Because he was so well behaved?!  How disappointing. I don't like to complain but it was such a massive let down that I asked for the manager and mentioned the above points and how disappointing it was...he had not much to say about it, except here's a 10% off card for next time. Erm I just spent nearly 100 on an experience I never want to experience again. No thank you.",

Even if I hadn't known the waiter and he hadn't been a gem and brought the staff out for a round of 'Happy Birthday', complete with birthday cheesecake, I'd still rate the place.  Decor and layout are fantastic. Equally private as it is ambient, gives you enough to look at when conversation lulls. Also recommended around the festive season given the tendency for fireworks along Princes St. and St. Andrew's Square (we were lucky to catch some of the latter from our vantage point, which added to the evening nicely).  On to the food. It surprises me that Chaopraya is part of a chain (not sure if Glasgow is the only other iteration?) given that the depth and authenticity of flavour is the best I've experienced outside of Thailand. We shared a Thai fondue to start, gifting us calamari, prawn, chicken, pork and fish cake skewers to dip into our deeper-than-you-think satay sauce. Loverly.  I followed up with a Four Seasons Duck Curry, complimented with grapes, pineapple and strawberries, which was fantastic. The missus' experience was a little lacking compared to mine, owing to overcooked prawns in her main, however her chili and lime dipping sauce was unreal. In a good way! Unreal.  Definitely a pricey night out but there really isn't much to complain about. The staff were gracious and attentive, the atmosphere and decor was warm and comfortable, the food was stunning, and the company was unbeatable. Happy Birthday, Jen.",

Without reservations we were quickly recommended to have a seat in the bar, which is gorgeous by the way. The passion fruit martini, samuri smile I believe, is to die for. Wonderful service found us a table on a busy evening. The service is some of the best you will experience. We shared the vegetable tempura which we loved, crispy duck salad was ok, prawn red curry and fish duo which were all amazing. Enough said, worth going to!!!!!!!",

Sitting in a sky high glass box looking out over the Edinburgh chimneys,  sipping a frankly fabulous  cocktail,  is pretty much as good as a hangover cure gets.   Or so I thought. Cue seriously great food and the afternoon just got better.   I had the chilli duck stir fry dish.  It was a prefect balance of delicate spice, heat and flavour.    I followed up with a very generous helping of coconut ice cream and mango sorbet.  Perfect.   Highly recommend.",

    "text": "Well, after previously giving this place 5 stars I have to say i was really disappointed with this visit. The service was still great and decor lovely however the food was disappointing. Standards have slipped! After a mixup with one of the starter options, which they rectified by bringing the correct dish as well as leaving the old, we found the pork satay quite tough and the sauce on the ribs a bit too citrusy for my liking. I love barbecue ribs normally but these weren't brilliant at all, smothered in this gloopy sauce. My chicken spring rolls were just ok, a bit too greasy perhaps.   My lamb curry dish was probably the best dish but that's not saying much. It had potatoes in it with an aromatic green sweet curry. Quite tasty but I could see no trace of the chickpeas which was one of the main selling points of the dish for me. The described \"slow cooked\" lamb didn't live up to reality as the lamb was a bit dry. No way were the chunks slow cooked in that curry for hours as described by the waiter. My dad's duck dish was terrible. Really overlooked and fatty. The only consolation was that they knew we didn't enjoy the food and took a couple of the dishes off the bill.   Wouldn't rush back. The kitchen has really let this place down. Never thought I'd see me dropping a 5 star to a 3. And the only reason they're getting 3 and not 2 was the attentive service and really nice waiters that tried to solve our problems. :(",

I was however pleasantly surprised, the service was authentic and the food was good. It didn't have some of the pre cooked or packaged meal feel that you get with chains trying to save on food cost.  We moved on to the balcony which was amazing thanks to the great summer we've had. Service was fast and attentive.  All round an excellent evening and looking forward to visiting again!",

We went for a cheeky lunch date to enjoy the sunshine on the terrace and the amazing views of the Castle and George Street. They have built a glass room on the top of the building for if the weather is bad, this and the terrace overlooks the castle. It is a lovely location day and night, or for a romantic destination. They also have a private room for dining with castle view. The food is amazing and the staff are absolutely fantastic. The waitress did mix up our order though but what we got while a surprise was still really good! Great for a cocktail too with some interesting new ones on the menu and a good wine list too.",

We were delightfully surprised with the ambiance as it was very clean and cozy (in a modern way).  They offered to take our shopping bags so we didn't have to clutter the table area and ushered us to a fine table on the covered terrace with a beautiful city/filtered river view.    They were happy to accommodate a requested substitution (chicken instead of pork belly for the basil saute), and service was attentive but not intrusive.  With all his said, the pad thai needed more spice/heat.  Conversely, the thai green curry had wonderful spice and was \"gorgeous.\"  In sum, food-wise, we've had better and we've had worse.  Food felt a bit mainstream (which stands to reason as it is a chain).",

From the Chaophraya 'glass box' on the roof above Castle Street you can see all the way to the ski slope to the south, over the Forth to Fife, to the north, and you have a gull's eye view over the street below.  Food? Oh yes, I got distracted there. The starters for the Christmas set menu were stunning. A dramatic display of spring rolls, pork kebabs, prawns and -um, something else that I forget - it was amazing. A rich tamarind spicy sauce and a delicious sweet chilli one - it really was delicious.  The mains in the lunch menu ... well, they were a wee big disappointing, just a fairly standard coconutty chicken curry and a prawn dish. Nothing wrong with them, but they didn't live up to the excitement of the starter.  It's a gorgeous place though, even if you're inside and not on the rooftop. Reasonably priced, too.  Get yourself up into the sky and see for yourself. I'm going back, that's for sure.  *looks round with beady eye, takes off with a squawk*",

My first visit here I couldn't get a table in the restaurant as they were so busy, but after eating somewhere else we retured to have some delicious and very morish cocktails in the bar. When we eventually managed to return to eat it exceeded my expectations!  The food was fantastic, and there is such a wide variety that even the fussiest of eaters will find something to eat. The price is very reasonable, as most Thai restaurants are quite expensive, but for a table of four with drinks i'd say 150 is very good.  The restaurant itself is breathtaking, as are the views of Edinburgh from the terrace, if you are booking ask to be seated in this area as you may be disappointed if you don't get it.  The staff are amazing, very attentive and sincere which is difficult to get in restaurants sometimes. Special mention as to go to Mario and Gary who have always made sure myself and my companions have had a fantastic time.  I recommend you try it, and will always be my first choice if I am asked for a good restaurant in Edinburgh. I literally cannot find any faults with this place, and I am a very very hard person to please where restaurants are concerned.",

    "text": "Wasn't immediately impressed by the service. Had arranged to meet a friend here late afternoon without having booked a table. I arrived, the place was half empty, and when I went to the reservation desk was asked to take a seat and wait for someone to attend to me. 10 minutes went by with no one appearing and then when someone did turn up they promptly spoke to a couple that had arrived after me.  A table was then found for my friend and I in the conservatory area and to be fair it's a great spot. I had a fried rice dish which was overly greasy but I'm not marking too harshly as my friend's food looked amazing as did many other dishes coming out of the kitchen.  I wouldn't rush back though, location and decor are excellent, but I've had many more enjoyable Thai meals.",

Definitely must try! The jasmine rice was so good, by son had 2 orders!! All was very good and very tasty. We loved the ambience and the  staff was wonderful. We were able to sit outside on the patio and the sights were so beautiful! We loved looking at the beautiful sites of Edinburgh. By the way, this was our first time and we had a great  time. The weather was gorgeous, sunny and comfortable. If I ever get to this place again, I will for sure come back to this restaurant. I wish they can open up one in Los Angeles!",

The interior is stunning and the view of the city, including the castle, is beautiful. Especially if you go at twilight as we did. i booked a table via there website which was very simple and straightforward to use. When we arrived they easily accommodated a table on the balcony for us. The staff are so polite and inviting.   We chose the 35.50 set menu and a bottle of white wine. The wine came quickly and was perfectly chilled.   The starter to share included ribs, dumplings, satay and crispy pork. All with a variety of dipping sauces, Each dish was very tasty and easily enough to share for two. Our main consisted of a red duck curry, a beef dish, a prawn and ginger stir-fry and a pork belly dish. The main also came with egg-fried rice.  The curry was beautiful, so fragrant and the duck was tender and moist. The prawns were also delicious and huge! The pork belly was a little disappointing, not crispy and very fatty even for pork belly.   The set also came with a fruit fondue dessert which was a nice light way to finish a meal.   Overall we were very happy with the food and service. The set menu is more than enough for two. With everything coming to around 90 it's not the cheapest but nice for a special occasion.  Cheers, Amy",

For main course, I ordered Seabass and it was absolutely perfect but my dessert was mind blowing, Thai mango sticky rice.  The location was fantastic. We ordered a bottle of wine in the balcony while we were waiting for our meal. Nice waiters and good service.",

Cocktails are also very good with smooth and slick service. Not cheap at 40 per person but great food, atmosphere, views of Edinburgh castle, staff and terrace. Worth a visit for sure.",

    "text": "First of all, the view is worth 5 stars alone. If you can get a table in the glass box at the back, you're treated to a panoramic view of Edinburgh, from the castle to the Pentlands to the Forth. Magnificent, and surely one of the best views in town.  Even if you can't get the view, the decor and style of the place is very nice, with statues, fish tank and generally upmarket feel. In fact, as you walk up the stairs and enter the main dining room, it feels like you've misread the menu and this isn't the place you'd planned to pop into for a 6.95 plate of pad thai at lunch.  The service is very attentive, if not in fact too obsequious for comfort. I know it's a Thai culture thing, but I don't really like being waited on by Uriah Heep. Most 'umble, most 'umble.  In keeping with the upmarket style of the interior, the presentation of the food is beautiful. Especially with mixed starters, everything is arranged handsomely on the serving dishes, supplemented with stylish cutlery and place settings and even the menu design.  So overall, it's a stylish establishment with a view to die for and inexpensive lunch prices. Sad to say, in the end, the food didn't live up to the surroundings. We've been twice now, and both times the food was pleasant enough, but lacking in zing and certainly lacking in spice. The curry had no chilli whatsoever, and was made with strange large smooth slices of chicken breast that resembled thick chicken loaf. My pad thai was lacking in any citrus or tamarind tang, and didn't come with a wedge of lime to spritz over the top, which was sorely needed in this case.  It was all ok, but so westernised as to be bland.  Giving it 4 stars because if you're looking to have a stylish lunch with a grand view, then this is a good bet. A glass of wine and a couple of sharing platters is quite pleasant, but don't go looking for an authentic or tongue-tingling sensation, when there are many other Thai restaurants in the city.",

    "text": "I was gutted when Tony Singh announced he was closing Olorosso, for 10 years it was a beacon of good food in the city. The views, the food and the service made for a great restaurant.  But as cities have a habit of doing we soon move on and in the place has come Chaophraya, they are on Twitter @ChaophrayaEdi.  Steph and I love a walk in town after the farmers market on a Saturday and decided to try this place for lunch. There is something grand about having to get an elevator to a restaurant and then the stunning staircase makes for a beautiful setting.  They have lunch and a la carte menus giving plenty of choice but for our lunch we opted for their house mixed platter. This came with smoked salmon tacos, a chicken curry, papaya salad and Thai ribs. At a very reasonable 10.95 this was perfect. The balance of spice, fragrance and sweetness was well managed and we both left wanting for more.  We will be back and this place comes highly Jd Recommended!     Posted with Blogsy",

    "text": "The restaurant is on the top floor and after a swift elevator trip and a few stairs you are greeted into an opulent and grand dining & bar area.   The fish tank is obviously the main focal point.   We were seated next to the tank and it provided and calming effect I found.  on seating we received a bowl with cassava crackers and sweet chili dip to nibble on when choosing or dishes.  We have been advised by previous visitors to not go for any sharing starters, thus I opted for the King Prawn and Mango Salad and Anita A. took the Chicken Satay Skewers.  The prawn salad was a let down. No real taste apart from the occasional punch of charcoal - the mango was a tad bland. The chicken satay was nice lightly flavoured and the peanut sauce was not carrying any heat, but was flavoursome if a little sweet.   For main I choose the pork belly with green beans, peppers, basil and chili. And a side dish of sticky rice. Anita had a beef curry dish with white rice. Missing the flavours on my dish I asked for additional chili flakes and soya sauce. The pork belly was cooked very well - with crispy bits! I used the sauce from Anita's curry dish to flavour my rice, which was very nice and well cooked  We finished with espresso and a brandy.  The Service was efficient, friendly and in all very good. Napkin placement, crumbing and genuinely interested how we liked our meals.   I was hoping for a little more in regards to the food, it wasn't dressed nor very tasty. Adequate which is in stark contrast to the location and the service.",
