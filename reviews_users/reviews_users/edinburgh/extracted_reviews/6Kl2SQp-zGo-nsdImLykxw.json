We had the fish and chips and ribs as appetizers - gotta get the ribs - sauce was fantastic - not the traditional thick molasses stuff but a sauce that was more like au jus style - the taste to die for - meat fell off the bone - tender and flavorful.  The portion was big enough for 4 people to have 2 pieces each.  Fish was fresh and crispy - cooked just right.  Definitely would go back.    Only complaint was that service was a bit slow as it was 2 waitresses managing the whole restaurant but we noticed that inmany restaurants in Scotland",

    "text": "A small bar on The Royal Mile, I must have walked past it hundreds of times without giving it a second glance, dismissing it as a typical tourist bar. Friends brought it to my attention when they dropped in for a quick drink and we have visited it numerous times since.  It IS small and can get pretty busy, they have a few tables outside which obviously attracts a lot of custom when the weather is good. The staff are very friendly and efficient, but you should make allowances for speed of service during busy periods especially during The Fringe. Reserving a table ahead of time is recommended if possible.  It is pretty much what you would expect from a \"traditional Scottish\" pub, with a selection of beers including three real ale casks, which are usually from small Scottish breweries, a beer \"flight\" is also available, allowing you to buy a third of a pint of each ale. They also have an extensive menu of approximately 50 whiskies (although some we asked for were not available), broken down by areas of the distillery. They offer a selection of whisky \"flights\", 4 whiskies based around a theme or area with prices varying to match (around 3 or 4 a glass). Being on the Royal Mile prices are possibly a bit inflated, but not excessively so, and are comparable to elsewhere on The Mile and central Edinburgh.  The food is also fairly \"traditional\" Scottish pub food, including dishes like Cullen Skink or haggis fritter for starters and  main courses like burgers, fish and chips and haggis, neeps and tatties, etc. The food is not just \"pub grub\" but of a good restaurant quality. I had a tower of Haggis, Neeps & Tatties (each layered on the other) which had an onion & rosemary gravy. I would have preferred a more traditional whisky cream sauce (which you do get with their haggis beefburger), but the gravy was good. None of our party had starters, but a couple of us did order dessert, the main complaint with the sticky toffee pudding was it was too large! I personally had the Cranachan (whipped cream, whisky soaked oatmeal, raspberries & honey) which was delicious!  In summary: good Scottish beers, good Scottish food and good Scottish whiskies.   N.B. They do a \"loyalty card\" which gives you a 10% discount on food and drink (see their website for how to apply).",

The restaurant is tucked away on High Street and is home to one of the most charming servers I have ever met. I can't remember her name but she was French and just so lovely. I ordered the goat cheese sandwich and she informed me that the cheese was late coming to the restaurant that day so I changed  my order to the BLT. Just as my companions' meals were coming, out server informed me that the cheese had arrived and that she was having a sandwich prepared for me. It was so kind and unexpected of her! The sandwich was amazing, and the cheese was very fresh.",

The meat was peppery delicious and with the mashed potatoes and wonderful brown gravy, it was a little reminiscent of comfort food back home of a very good beef Manhattan except with a great peppery kick.

I feel like it was not really trying haggis because it was deep fried and had a sweet chili sauce.  But I loved the sauce and it was so good.  We got the fish and chips and shepard's pie to share.  Both were amazing!  The shepards pie was made with lamb which is not my favorite but it worked really well in this.  The fish and chips was one of my favorite on the trip, including all the times we had it in London!  We also got the sticky toffee pudding which came with ice cream.  It was amazing... hot and flavorful and the ic cream totally complimented the sticky toffee.  The waitress was very friendsly and gave honest recommendations.  I highly recommend this place!",

    "text": "My family came here while visiting Edinburgh. Our ancestors were Scottish and we're descendants of the McGregor Clan, so when we saw this quaint little pub on the Royal Mile, we couldn't resist.   This is a great place to come when you want to rest your legs, warm your bones, and escape the crowds. It's right on the main road from the Castle to the Palace, so it was surprising that it was so quiet.   I personally ordered the Mature Cheddar Panini. For all you Americans out there; \"Rocket\" is the term they use for Arugula. They use this term all over the UK and it confused the living hell out of us, until I finally asked what the heck it was. And it was Arugula. Go figure. So anyway, the panini comes with Arugula and tomato chutney. It was pretty good, but I thought it was missing something. Perhaps some onions?   Others in my party enjoyed the Pulled Pork Burger and the Fish and Chips. Apparently the Fish and Chips were a tad too greasy. But there were no complaints about the burgers.   Finally, some of us got a couple beers on tap. Unfortunately, I don't remember the names but I know they were local and it was a special Christmas brew. As this is beer country, they were delicious and refreshing. Word of the wise; if you're in the UK and you go to any old pub, order beer. There's no excuse not to.   This was a cool spot and a nice moment for us Americans to enjoy. It looks and feels like a traditional pub, so we had a great time. The food wasn't awe inspiring, but after miles of walking, all we really wanted was some warmth and some food in our bellies. And this was the perfect place to stop.",

Sitting across from the bar you could see how hard everyone was working to make the place hum.  More importantly the drinks and food matched the quality of places we had paid double for on this trip.  You could tell the kitchen takes the time to plate properly for a nice presentation in addition to cooking it nearly perfectly - way beyond what you expect from pub grub!  Cullen skink (a fish chowder of smoked haddock, potatoes and cream soup) - this was really tasty but could have had a few more pieces of fish and a bit less potato.  Chicken stuffed with haggis - the chicken was baked and was a bit dry in spots but the rest was fine.  The combination with the haggis was really tasty and made up for the chicken.  Tower of haggis - this is built from mashed potatoes and mashed turnips with haggis on the bottom surrounded by a moat of gravy.  I was glad there was a lot of gravy because the tower was so big I ended up using it all up.  Again highly recommended.  If you haven't had haggis before, make this the place you try it first.  It was really great!",

On the other hand, my beer was great and it seems like a fairly traditional pub so if you're looking to grab a drink with friends, not a bad stop.",

Service was wonderful with the staff working so quickly to find us a table inside as it was quite chilly for outdoor seating. The number of tables is limited in this small space and it is very popular so having a reservation or sitting outside is a good idea.  The food was utterly divine! I tried one of the rare whiskey that was recommended from one of the whiskey flights - highly recommend having a whiskey with your dinner as they offer numerous options from different areas of Scotland. Vegetarian options were quite numerous which was rare to find in our travel through the UK and they also offer salads and fresh veggies (another rare find). Traditional dishes with new twists - had the haggis fritters which I could have eaten many of! They even offer vegetarian haggis! Food was super tasty and highly recommend as a delicious eatery stop for anyone traveling through Edinburgh who wants to try local fare.",

The restaurant is not very big so either be prepared to wait, or you can call ahead and make a reservation. We made a reservation, and the table was ready for us when we arrived. Unfortunately I wanted their mussels, but they were out (guess that means they're really good!) so I got the curry instead. I wouldn't really recommend the curry as it was a bit watery, and on top of rice noodles which I found a bit odd. And since they came out together, the noodles were very soggy and thin by the time I ate it. It almost felt like just eating soup with vegetables. I will say however my friends for the chicken and beef pies, and those were VERY good. I would recommend the beef pie.   We ended the night with whiskey flights which was also pretty awesome.",

Listed as one of 55 recommended restaurants in the Michelin Guide for Edinburgh, this one was admittedly chosen for their selection of whiskey.  Of course the food is good.  For starters, the first taste of cold smoked Scottish salmon.  Incredibly rich, fatty, very smooth mouth feel.  The intense razor sharp flavor of salmon, unmistakable.  The game terrine, outstanding.  Course ground bits of this and that with a light livery flavor and anise overtones.  Great texture unfortunately, the traditional oatcakes; lets just say horse biscuits are not for me.  For mains, a dish known as Crofters Chicken (oven baked chicken breast stuffed with hagggis served with a whisky sauce, sauteed cabbage and root veg).  A brilliant way to introduce haggis to the uninitiated.  The mineral, livery flavor of the offal is mellowed by the chickeny, poultry flavor.  The jus from the chicken moistens the haggis.  The whisky sauce adding a velvity, rich, concentrated whisky flavor to the dish.  Good eats.  Very good selection of whisky (nearly 100), many offered in flights for tasting.  All flights come complete with the requisite water and chocolates.  Do not be that guy who asks for ice.  They will frown at that faux pas as it will cloud the whisky and ruin it.  Friendly service.  Very reasonably priced.  Mains average 12.  A charming, fairly priced pub with great whisky and food.  A fitting welcome to Edinburgh.",

For my main course, I ordered the vegetarian haggis tower which was spectacular!  The veggie haggis was quite spicy but it was so good.  For dessert, I had the Crannachan which was totally amazing! The service here was very good, and there are tons of beverage options.  The prices are quite reasonable also. The restaurant isn't too large, but it is cozy and the tables are comfortable.

Our server had excellent suggestions for gin sampling to pair with the cranachan that we ordered for desert. It was sublime! Really happy memories of delicious food and wonderful service at the Royal McGregor. Thank you!",

    "text": "At that point of our vacation, we were both looking for a meal with greens, or something vegetarian, or something...just something not all meat-based. We walked the Mile one or two times, stopping to view menus, before popping in here for lunch.  We decided to share a bowl of Cullen Skink before ordering our main meals: Halloumi Burger for me, and the Highland Burger for him.  I was blown away by the Cullen Skink - it was like the Boston chowder that I know from home, but a million percent better. It was smoky but creamy, with giant chunks of fish. It was served with a couple pieces of bread, which we definitely used to sop up all the good stuff.  The halloumi burger was a new one for me; I'd never had halloumi before. The cheese was a bit...chewy?...and became difficult to eat as there were two pieces piled on top of each other. It came with a small pile of chips, and a side of guacamole and a spicy mayo. I used both of those on the sandwich, and they added a lot of flavor.   To be honest, the thing that drew us in was the promise of the \"salad garnish\" that was supposed to come with the burger. It didn't materialize, but I was okay with that at the end. My husband liked his burger - though it was meat topped with meat in addition to meat.   We were pleasantly surprised by the food, service and beer selection. I'm glad we took a chance and went in.",

    "text": "Great pub off the Royal Mile. I don't know who McGregor is, but I royally liked the pub. My sister and I enjoyed an aperitif after dinner here when we wandered past this place.   We sat at the bar and made chit chat with the very pleasant bartender. We were heading out of Scotland the next day and I wanted to try Irn Bru, which is the beloved soft drink of the country. I did NOT like the first drink, but over time it wasn't so bad. It was very odd tasting, like bubble gum cough syrup. I know you're like, \"Gross, you drank it all?\" Yup, and I'd do it again. It used to have way more sugar, but the company changed the composition after the sugar tax. Not much has changed flavor-wise, not that I would know...  My sister tried the whisky flight, and the best tasting one ended up being the one from Japan. Yeah, Japan makes a pretty good whisky and I was a little shocked it beat out the other Scottish 'skys. For those reading this in Anchorage AK head to Ginger, they serve this there. Good place, but probably won't come again due to location.  On another note, I met a man in London who told me that Scotland used to be the center of Pangaea, so it's the only country that retains all 5 different soils and why the peat is so popular during whisky making. I state this fact based on zero research conducted on his statements.",

The bottom line is that the place seems to give a damn, and that makes all the difference in the world.  So no, this isn't a \"Destination\" spot. Then again, if you're on the way to the castle, or just in the hood, it's a perfectly good place to stop for a bite and a drink...  Oh, btw, the food really *is* better than expected. The fish 'n chips is really good, but that's (somewhat) easy. The other stuff on the menu though, oh, is actually, surprisingly, good",

I had grilled scottish salmon which had the perfect crispy exterior tender middle.  The appetizers were great and the haggis burger is not bad at all.  The bar was perfect size to order drambuie and scotch and just think about life or talk about world peace with the nice bartenders.",

    "text": "This pub located on the Royal Mile is touristy with decent but touristy prices. They aren't bad, and it's great if you want a drink and a hot meal. The service was good once the menu's were on the table. Once again our dinner consisted of Haggis, nips and tatties and a cheeseburger. The burger was 7 pounds, very meaty and big and came with chips and salad. The haggis, nips and tatties were neatly arranged in a fat, perfectly circular tower, garnished with greens on top and surrounded by a moat of gravy. I sampled the haggis and it was MMMMMM MMMM GOOD!    There is also a 7 pound walking tour during the day and a 5 pound ghost tour that starts 9.30pm outside this pub, just FYI.",

If the drinks were that bad I am certainly glad we didn't eat there!! I would say this is a miss!! Great location but absolutely the worst drink we've ever had.",

Decided I was going to try Haggis for the first time so I started with the Haggis Fritters. They are very good and not at all scary like I thought they would be. There were three in the appetizer order so you can share with the table.  Had the steak and ale pie for the main course and it was a quite large portion. My friend had the fish and chips and he liked them as well.  I would recommend the Royal Mcgregor to any hungry sightseers that happen to be in the Old Town walking down the Royal Mile.",
