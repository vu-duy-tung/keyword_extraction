    "text": "I'm all for paying the right price for meals. With promise of locally sourced, gourmet prepared dishes- I was very willing to fork out.   While the food was decent, but a couple of things really threw me for a spin and I felt jibbed by my 35 meal;  - there is a balance between attentive serving, and passive aggressively rushing. Yes, I walked in off the street and obviously a tourist... But I should not have been rushed. Case in point: there was a server standing next to me watching me take my last bite- for all 3 courses! - so they can take the plates away immediately  - 3.95 for two half slices of bread and a pad of butter? Seriously? That better have been Himalayan pink salt on the butter, otherwise I call it a hidden service charge   - the waitress working my table, I suspect, has English as her second language. Well guess what, me too. I guessed it was language/ cultural barrier but in hospitality there is no reason to open the dialogue with \"are you ready to order\". Really- the very first thing she said to me was that. No hello/ good evening/ how are you  - there was not a lick of green vegetable in both my Cullen Skink, or my lamb roast. Maybe some chopped herb garnishes. Meal was all starch and protein. The end.   - dessert menu was boring. If you've ever spoke to an executive chef with no experience or interest in pastry, they will always put simple faithful a like fruit crumble, panna cotta and cheesecake on a dessert menu. This is what Howie's offered  Well it's not all doomed. Their meat dish and the lamb gravy was divine. Wish there was more gravy though.",

McHowie's, maybe, or the Laird of Howie, but it is what it is. A short walk from the Scotsman Hotel on the scenic Grass Market, this was a great meal! We managed to avoid the black pudding (sausage made from pig blood - I'll pass) and had a fine meal, starting with skink. This is not the slinky skink with a long tail - it's a chowder made with smoked haddock. Way excellent. Also, a chicken breast stuffed with sundried tomatoes and red peppers couldn't have been better. A little noisy (the venue, not the chicken...), but not overbearingly so.  If I ever get back to Edinburgh, which is doubtful, I'll definitely hit Howie's up for more skink. But give it a try...it beats the McDonalds (another Scottish restaurant) up the block.",

    "text": "The hubby and I popped into Howie's around noon on new years day after unsuccessfully attempting to eat at Oink (again, for the six time).   The space is awesome - the owner told me it was a stable in it's old life. It's nicely decorated and since we were there over the holidays, they had a tree and some other Christmassy decorations arranged throughout the restaurant. Upon entering, you will be greeted by one of the many smiling staff and with the smell of delicious coffee and food.   Their two-course lunch offering was something we simply could not refuse. At 9.95, it was a steal. Included was either a starter and main or main and dessert. The husband and I opted for the starter/main option.   They offer daily specials which are detailed on a big black chalkboard hung high in the dining room. You know, pie of the day, casserole of the day, fish of the day, drink of the day. You get the drift.  The drink of the day - obviously since it was new years day - was a bloody mary. \"Two of those, please\" we said. The sad truth was that they were terribly disappointing - something you'd get in a chain pub.  I ordered the carrot and coriander soup as my starter which came with a slice of bread. It was delicious. Absolutely delicious. I have no idea what my husband ordered because I was so enamored with my soup.  For the mains, the husband ordered the beef casserole with root veg and mash and I ordered the steak pie with greens and mash. The long and short of our two orders were that they were basically teh same dish. The minor differences being that mine was served in a baking dish and his in a bowl, mine had carrots and his had parsnips, and mine had a pasty \"lid.\" Everything else was the same - a good way to go about things from a kitchen perspective.  We both really liked the beef in our dishes. It was cooked well and neither of us found fatburgs floating around in our dishes. I could have done without the pasty crust but that's a personal thing. I'm just not a pasty kind of girl. I thought the mashed potatoes paired well with my kale and steak pie but my husband commented, \"Your mash is better than this mash.\" Thanks, I muttered.  Overall, top notch for the food (one note though is that I think there are two microwaves in the kitchen which were being used A LOT which is kind of concerning).  Service was really good but we did have one issue. I ordered a glass of wine which never arrived. When the manager stopped by our table (randomly to see how we were getting on), she asked if we needed anything and I mentioned my MIA wine and she said that she would take care of it and she did, like immediately and then told us that they had comped the wine due to the mishap. Now, this is what I expect at restaurants and, unfortunately, this level of service is just so hard to find outside of the US. Job well done, Howie's!",

    "text": "Howies is a bit of an edinburgh institution, it's been around for years and offers quailty bistro food from fresh ingredients.  having never actually been, when it was decided that this was where we would be having our work christmas lunch i was looking forward to finally trying it.  we arrived at half two on a friday afternoon and were shown to a long table along the back wall.  the restaurant space is a bit odd... on entering there is a tiny waiting area which also serves as the bar so not ideal when you're a massive party squashed in waiting to be seated.  also the space lacks atmosphere and is sort of soulless with clean walls and a mix of blues for colouring.  the restaurant is two rooms, one slightly larger than the next and these may have more atmosphere on a normal night instead of when its packed with office christmas parties.  we had barely sat down when we were offered an aperetif and had our starters placed in front of us.  i had the spicy parsnip soup, which was quite nice and a good sized portion.  starters were shortly followed by mains of which i found my venison stew tasty but not overly impressive.  the stew compromised of venison, carrots, and a serving of mashed potatoes.  i thought it could have used a few more veg to round it out but found it to be nice just not that exciting.  finally dessert arrived in speedy time and i was quite pleased with my cheese board.  three different types of cheeses, quince, and a good number of oatcakes.  i would have appreciated being told what the cheeses were though...  so overall i thought Howie's was ok, it was nice enough that i would go back to try it on a non-christmas dinner basis but not so nice that i would go rushing back.  the part that really bothered me was that the whole meal felt like we were on a conveyor belt in some factory instead of there to enjoy a nice meal.  we were in and out in just over 2 hours which isn't really enough time to enjoy a three course meal.  hopefully if i make a repeat visit i'll be able to update my review with a further star.",

I tried my first Thistly Cross Cidar that is made just 10 miles away and it was refreshing.  The Haggis was fantastic-I am officially a Haggis Fan!

The salmon, however, was under seasoned an overcooked. They didn't include the skin nor any lemon. I seasoned it myself and acided it and it was ok.  However the service was unfortunate. As the lunch service got busier, the staff couldn't keep up with anything. My water was refilled only sparingly, and only after asking, and it took two tries to ask for lemon. Even the lemon that came was oddly cut.  Overall, good food, very poor service when busy. I think it's because it's understaffed slightly. Probably a lot better when there are less people.  They also included a service fee, which is the first time any Scottish restaurant has done so for a group that is not large. I will be the one to decide whether you deserve a tip. And in this case, clearly not.  Disappointing. It's also taking forever for them to pick up the check. Tunnel vision.",

My friend and I both remarked on how nice it was. There are a lot of staff, which is luxurious. Someone took my coat, someone sat me, another brought water, maybe one of the earlier ones took our order, a different one delivered it. It was funny, because usually you'd strike up little conversations with your waiter, but here it was always someone new, and if you were boring/naughty you could just keep saying the same things.  Anyway, the food was good. Not great, not WOW! It was tasty. I'd be fine if someone suggested this place again. A note on their Gluten Free options: some menu items have the little GF symbol, but it means they CAN be GF, like if something listed which sounds like it has gluten is taken out. For instance, one of the desserts was a pannacotta with a ginger biscuit and whatever. But to be GF there would be no biscuit. Not that there was also a GF ginger biscuit. So kinda disappointing in the level of accommodation.",

Quality of the food was great. They have a kids menu which is awesome. Soup, main and desert.",

    "text": "We stumbled upon this casual restaurant for dinner on a recent visit to Edinburgh, and had such a lovely dinner, that we came back for lunch the next day for our last meal in the city, only to be sadly disappointed. Our dinner was a 4-star, and our lunch a 2-star, so I split the two with a 3-star rating.    For dinner, we had perfectly cooked steak filets (mine medium-well, my friend's medium), tasty cocktails and wine.  And THE DESSERT. Just come for the dessert: This restaurant serves the BEST Banoffee dessert that I have ever had.  If I hadn't been so full, I would have ordered another on the spot.  So we did the next best thing and returned for lunch, with a plan to start and end the lunch with Banoffee.  This dessert was consistent and didn't disappoint.  It was SO GOOD (as a starter and as a finish!).  My friend ordered a lunch special with tomato soup (it was fresh, she added butter, but I like mine without), and a ravioli (which was bland and strange and in a watery broth that fell flat and severely disappointed).  I ordered the filet special again, but instead was brought a different (and less tasty) cut of steak.  When I pointed this out, the server politely offered to request me a new entree, but as we were already running late to catch our flight, I didn't have time to wait for them to cook a new one.  I ate it, but it certainly lacked the flavor and texture of the steak that I had had the night before.    We ended our meal with the Banoffee.  Delicious.  And for our trouble, they didn't charge us for this second dessert, which exhibits good overall sense and customer service.  While I would be willing to give Howie's another chance at a good meal, hoping the inconsistency was a rare event, my friend was so put off that she likely would not visit again.    Go for the dessert, and see what you think.  Meanwhile, I am wondering if I would perhaps be able to lure my friend back for the Banoffee alone. It was really that delightful.",

I'm quite fussy when it comes to food largely due to food intolerances but also because I refuse to eat meat that isn't at least free range. When I saw Howies sources their produce locally and that their chicken was free range I was sold. Even better the chicken dish was gluten and onion free!  Despite the restaurant being busy, we were quickly shown to a table and the service was very prompt and friendly. Our food took around 10 -15 minutes to come out.  It was delicious! The chicken was cooked the perfection, the chicken jus was tasty and the potatoes and beans rounded off the dish beautifully. I would have loved to have stayed and tried the dessert however as we were in a rush we had to go! I wouldn't hesitate to return.",

For example, 20 minutes to get a glass of wine. The starter (soup) was tremendously over-salted to the point of being almost inedible. My companion's entree was entirely incorrect and had to be reordered. A saving grace was the \"banoffee pie\", which was fantastic. When the bill came, the incorrect (more expensive) entree was still on the bill, which we asked to be corrected. Also, we (Americans) were asked if we wanted to pay the service charge which had already been included in the bill...which made us very uncomfortable. Interesting that the local patrons on either side of us weren't asked about including a service charge. All in all, I would give it a C for service and a B-minus for food quality, awesome dessert notwithstanding.",

The only reason why I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is that i had ordered soup and they forgot. We ended up having our soup after the main meal. The staff was very apologetic and didn't charge us for the soup (which was really good btw).",

I'd make a reservation as we arrived at 5:30 on a Saturday, and by 6:30 it was really filling up. They were very accommodating with my friend's 4 year old son, as well!  They had Nanny State low-alcohol beer, my very favorite, so I applaud them for having something so tasty for preggos and non-drinkers.  I ended up getting their half lobster special - 14.95 for a half lobster in garlic butter, fries, and salad.  First, my husband and I shared the pigeon breast with black pudding, which was very good, all the other ingredients like golden raisins and pickled carrots played off each other beautifully.  The fresh-baked bread with olive oil and balsamic was a lovely thing to start with as well. You do have to pay for it, but it's cheap, so you aren't being ripped off by the bread basket.  Some of our friend started with the mussels and were really unhappy with them, and said they tasted fishy and weren't fresh.  They ended up exchanging for the haggis which everyone thought was delicious and loved. Staff were very accommodating and quick about this.  My lobster wasn't particularly hot, just warm, or particularly big, but the meat was tender and lovely, and I got big flavor from the garlic butter.  I just wanted more of it, and wanted it to feel a bit more piping hot.  The salad alongside was just some lightly dressed rocket, but the fries were golden and crisp and came in a big pile - as the lobster portion was small, I inhaled them all!  I tasted my husband's catch of the day (hake with chorizo and kale) which was good, but not as good as I hoped it would be, although beautifully presented.  Our sticky toffee pudding with ice cream was a classic example of the dish - a small portion, but extremely good and just the right temperature.  They were also very accommodating when 2 of us had to leave in a flash to make a train, letting us pay our part of the bill first and even bringing some shortbread cookies for everyone along with the bill.  We had a wonderful evening here with friends, but the food didn't stand out as exceptional.  It all looked beautiful, and some dishes were certainly better than others, but overall the presentation was superior to the preparation.",

First off, they have an amazing lunch special! 2 courses at lunch 10.95 and 3 courses for 13.95. I opted for the 3 course lunch special. For appetizer, I had to try something that was traditional scottish food and ordered the Haggis, neeps & tatties. For the second course, I ordered the catch of the day, which was a pan fried hake fish. For dessert, I had Howies famous banofee pie. The biscuit base, toffee, banana & whipped cream with toasted almonds was amazing!!!! DELICIOUS food here for an affordable price. Also, customer service was great!",

    "text": "My wife and I chose to go to Howies for our 'fancy' dinner during our trip to Edinburgh and we had a lovely time.   Part of the reason we chose Howies was because it had a reputation for making really good haggis, which neither of us had tried before. So, as you can imagine, we started off the meal with the haggis, neeps, and tatties appetizer! Overall, it was quite good, though I should mention that it is a bit spicy. It's not much spice in an individual bite, but it does build as you eat.  For dinner, I got a fish course from their specials menu which was fantastic! And for dessert, my wife and I shared a chocolate and beetroot tart which was also quite good.  Overall, I recommend Howies. They've got a great selection of high quality Scottish food!",

The seared pigeon breast was served medium with pink center, delicate flavor on a bed of herbs & sprouts. The Haggis was moist, delicious and served with mashed potato & rutabaga!  For our mains, we tried the daily catch (hake) and venison haunch- the venison was slightly tough, but gamey and flavorful with brown gravy!    Definitely try the Whisky Flight if you are a whisky fan! Our waitresses were amazing - highly attentive and checked in with us for every course. We hope to be back again soon :)",

The placards they have outside look a bit too official and corporate, which gave me pause, but it was close to where we were staying and they had a lunch special on offer. Luckily the style of adverts outside don't define the dining experience inside.  I had the cullen skink and split the super salad with salmon, which was just the right amount of food so that I would be able to handle a big dinner later in the night.  The service was really friendly and quick, no complaints whatsoever in that department. The food was also very good as well. Cullen skink, as I'm given to understand it, is a very heavy, hearty soup, but it was delicious without weighing me down too much. It had a really nice combination of flavors. The salad was also delicious, with the salmon being perfectly cooked. The dressing was interesting - it could have used a bit of salt - but overall I was very satisfied.  Would definitely come back if I'm back in Edinburgh!",

We decided to the \"Haggus, snippies & tatties\" and Pigeon breast for appetizers.  Both were delicious.   I had the beef casserole - it was perfectly a spiced and cooked stew. Two folks had chicken and one of our party had the lamb.  We ended sharing bites because everyone loved there meals.   Incredibly tasty and fresh.   We shared a couple of the poached rhubarb deserts with apple sorbet.  It was a great end to a great meal.   We are only here for a short time, so I doubt we will make it back, but would all definitely recommend it.",

We also had cullen skink, which I'd never heard of, but is apparently a classic. I asked what vegetarian haggis was, and it was described as vegetables made to taste like real haggis. I wish I tried their haggis (vegetarian or classic). The casserole was solid, and the venison was quite good. I LOVED the cullen skink. Service is wonderful, vibe is casual (great after a day of travels and adventures), and prices very reasonable.",

Only negative is that they staff is pretty aloof. They do get to you eventually, but don't come here if you are in a rush or if you are an impatient American. The staff is fun, but that may be the issue. They have so much fun interacting with each other, that I think they can forget about the customers. Just come here relaxed and chill, without other plans, and have a great meal at a great price.",

I will get the food out of the way although to be fair it as expected is the main event and was more than a little tasty.  Starter: Warm salad of seared wood pigeon breast with bacon, croutons & sherry vinegar dressing Main: Fillet of Shetland Salmon with a scallop beignet , crispy herb polenta & caponata sauce Pudding: Duo of Sorbet (blackcurrant and Lemon for me).  I have to say the food was excellent with one minor floor with my starter, the croutons were more like stale bread rather than their description but all in all I really enjoyed the entire meal. The staff were polite and knew there stuff, even the one who needs to speak a little slower in order to be understood (but still charming). I certainly would recommend this place to people if you are visiting Edinburgh.",

Server was pleasant and friendly.  They had a nice deal where you can get 2 dishes for around 9 pounds. I had the Haggis with nips and tatties(that's turnips and potatoes for those of you who are scratching your heads) and the salmon with potatoes served with a tomato based sauce.  The bread served was decent, I just don't like when they serve the almost frozen butter. Anyway... Food came pretty quick. The Haggis dish was delish the salmon I didn't like that much because the tomato base sauce didn't really work for me.  The check was served with a couple of cookies. I asked the server to add a 20% tip to the bill but she said there's an optional service charge of 10% which covers the tip. So no need.  So it was a great deal for pretty decent food and fast, good service.",

Heads up - they ask if you want bread and olive oil but don't tell you it's a charge of 1.6 pounds.   We decided to come back later for dessert because we thought the banoffee pie looked good.  We stood there in the foyer for a good five minutes as someone (the owner?) behind the bar was rustling about and two waitresses walked to and from the bar.  Not a single person acknowledged us the entire time we were standing there.  Felt like I was being purposefully ignored! Finally after ~5 minutes I asked if there was seating and I was told a flat 'no'.  It was 9:15pm and the restaurant closes at 10pm. We could clearly see there were open tables.  If she had only asked I would've mentioned we just wanted fast dessert.   Overall really mediocre food and terrible, rude service.",

I was surprised by these things:  -The prices are totally reasonable -The food is DELICIOUS -And all this is in a super touristy, busy restaurant. (We were there during Fringe, so maybe it was busier than normal)  You wouldn't expect these 3 things to go together!  We got the prix fixe menu. My soup starter and salmon entree were delicious and thoughtfully prepared. For dessert we had sticky toffee pudding and banoffee pie--both were INCREDIBLE. Overall we were extremely pleased!! We had to wait about 30 minutes for a table but it was worth it. Definitely make a reservation!",

He also really enjoyed his lamb dinner. I was excited to try Scottish salmon, and Howie's pan fried salmon was AMAZING. I compared all of the salmon dishes for the rest of the trip to this one! I was also thrilled to find a smoked carrot and vegetable appetizer, which we split and enjoyed. It was nice to have some veggies on the menu since I noticed that most Scottish menus were very heavy in general. Definitely try Howie's for a modern spin on Scottish food, and get the salmon!",

We got the house made bread, olive oil/balsamic, hummus, and olives to start. The hummus and bread was amazing. For my main I got the pan-fried gnocci (more than delicious) and my mom got some sort of chicken dish with cauliflower puree and roasted potatoes. She loved it. For dessert we had the howies famous banofee pie (amazing) and the scottish cheese sampler! Cheese sampler was okay, my mom and I like to try new things, but since we are just visiting and haven't had Scottish cheese before, we didn't like it very much. But if you like cheese, I recommend it. We got their early dinner deal (2 courses for 14.95, Sunday-Thursday, from 4:30-6:30?) which is more than a great deal! Highly recommend Howie's.",

We started off with a few orders of bread and some drinks. The bread, which comes with oil and balsamic vinegar to dip in, was highly addicting! It was hot and fresh.  Our drinks were amazing! I ordered the gin spritz which was refreshing.   For my main meal I ordered the pan roasted chicken breast, served with potatoes and green beans. The portion was tiny and the chicken was a little bland. I wouldn't recommend the chicken dish. My boyfriend ordered the salmon and loved it.   For dessert, we ordered the toffee cake. Must get! Authentic and delicious!",

Entree = Chicken. Chicken was cooked perfectly and so we the veggies. I thought the entree was just okay, though. The sauce was a bit bland. I felt like it was missing something, but not sure what. Dessert = banana/biscuit pie. Good, but way too much whipped cream! We wound up scraping 90% of the cream off. It was just overwhelming and too thick.  Service was pretty awful, unfortunately. The restaurant itself is beautiful and it is in a great location.  Overall, I would come back.",

    "text": "High yield: A scottish restaurant that offers truly scottish fare such as cullen skink, venison casserole, Atlantic Hake, catch of the day, salads, and soups but with aloof service despite a cheerful and nice environment. Prices are very decent, less than 10 pounds and large portions   Food: Great food and truly a must for those who want to experience Scottish food experience. We ordered the Atlantic Hake, Venison Casserole, Cullen Skink. I give them a 5/5 for food  Cullen Skink- it's a fish chowder with potatoes and is super hearty and delicious. I highly recommend this to anyone visiting Scotland- flavor is warm and comfortable and great for a cold day. You can get it as a bowl or as a main entree.  Venison Casserole- Tasted like a beef stew with carrots and on top a dollop of Mashed Potatoes. highly recommend too, cuz where else you gonna eat Venison?? And the price was less than 9 pounds.  Atlantic Hake: There is catch of the day, which usually is Salmon but to me if you're gonna try out a Scottish dish, go for their local fish which is this hake. it is a white fleshed fish that is a very soft version of tilapia or even Halibut. It's not chickeny or fishy tasting, and doesn't have that flaky feeling that some ocean fish have. No bones inn this fillet and comes with veggies underneath.   Service: i won't lie but this what prevented me from giving them the 5/5. I have never seen such rude/aloof service in all of Edinburgh. Staff was like robots doing their job for sake of doing rather than actually caring about the customers. We asked for hot water refill and that took forver, and saw our waitress busying herself with setting up tables etc that were items I felt could have waited. We asked her to take a photograph and she kept saying 2 mins while she finishes with another customer... and another customer.... and another. When she did serve us, very cold and kind of insincere. so I have to give her a 2/5 for service. The other waiters also seemed like that too except the drinks guy in the front.   Price: Everything less than 10 pounds. No reason why anyone would not give this place a shot if they are wanting scottish fare.",

Don't be afraid of the haggis, It tastes like meatloaf, bu a bit grainier! If you want a more thorough review, check out Sandy J's 12/28/2106 review.  She said it all!",

You'll have to book ahead. We walked in on a Friday night and were politely told there were no tables available for any time that night, so we went ahead and booked for Saturday.   We started with focaccia and the trio of olives, hummus, and olive tapenade. The tapenade was a little dry, but the bread was delicious, as were the olives. We then tried the haggis and Cullen skink appetizers. The haggis was delicious, and by far the best we had on the trip. If in doubt, try it! I didn't care as much for the Cullen skink, but maybe it just wasn't to my taste - a little too salty for me.   For mains we had the salmon (wonderful), lamb (although the accompanying lentils were undercooked), soup of the day (sweet potato and coconut - good), and ribeye with frites. My steak was well cooked, but it lacked flavor a bit. It was good, but I would choose something else if visiting again.   For dessert we had the poached rhubarb, banoffee pie, brownie, and sticky toffee pudding. All were good. The pudding was decadent, and I was glad there was accompanying ice cream, which cut the sweetness.   Make a booking - you'll enjoy!",

There was no way I was leaving Edinburgh without my haggis, so I scouted 'round here on the Yelp, which revealed that Howie's was a solid choice. Fact-checked that with some Edinburgh-local colleagues, and made my booking for a table on my last night in the city.  It was perfection. Service was stellar, the haggis was some of the best I've had (spent teen years in the UK, family lived in UK again later, so I got haggis knowledge) over a lifetime, and the grilled hake I had as a main course was a dream.

    "text": "Got word from our tour guide to try the haggis here and were so glad we did! We came here for lunch and got the haggis as an appetizer. We never tasted it so we didn't want a full batch if we couldn't finish it.   Definitely wish we got the full size because it was scrumptious! The appetizer was actually a good amount of food. The whiskey sauce was yummy and the neeps and tatties were both great. The haggis itself was full of flavor and depth and had a hint of spice to it that I didn't mind at all.   We tried to come back for dinner but the price for the full dish of haggis is higher for dinner so beware of that. It's a bit pricey but I'd rather have pricey yet good quality haggis than not! We also had the fish special that day and it was fresh and the veggies were perfectly cooked!!! We had the Duck app and that was perfect. The stew of the day was STUNNING. I had nothing that I didn't like!",

Be adventurous and try  the Cullen skink a thick creamy fish soup made with smoked haddock and you will not be sorry!

My husband and I ate here for lunch and were very impressed by the the simple, yet elegant, atmosphere. The staff was professional, and the food was fresh and thoughtfully prepared and plated. We had Scottish highlights such as cullen skink, mushroom soup, leek risotto, and pan fried hake (catch of the day). I thought everything was spot on, including the complimentary bread.   How would I describe Howies in two words? \"Scottish bistro,\" if that makes any sense. They feature fresh, locally sourced ingredients. The chefs give a damn about presentation and attention to details. It's a good compromise between having to go to a pub or a high-end restaurant for a meal. I thought prices were very reasonable.",

For supper I ordered mussels for my starter and the it were luscious; prepared to perfection.  I had the Cullen Skink (fish chowder) and it is the only chowder I have eaten in the past 50 years that is comparable to the clam chowder served at San Francisco's Normandy restaurant.  It's velvety smooth with potatoes, onions and fish cooked exactly as anticipated. The next day I returned for lunch and again mussels for the starter and again, perfectly prepared.  For my main course I had the Scottish dish everyone dares another to try; haggis.  It was served with mashed potatoes and a mashed orange colored squash in a smattering of brown gravy.  All I could taste was the spices used in the haggis, especially the pepper.  Haggis is mostly Scottish oats and that's the texture.  Supposely, finely chopped or ground beef \"innards\".  Now many people of my generation (my assumption) grew up eating most of an animal's organs but younger Americans not so much.  Nonetheless, the plate was tasty and very filling. The service was excellent and cordial.  The atmosphere is comfortable and unpretentious.  I can highly recommend this restaurant.",

Needless to say we weren't disappointed I had a starter, main course, and dessert. For my starter I ordered cured duck it came out beautifully plated before I even got to try it I was drooling haha! The duck was amazing it had a perfect balance of sauces and veggies to go along with it. Dessert was even more lovely we asked for our servers recommendation and she pointed us towards a sticky toffee pudding that was truly incredible, overall great service good prices and a truly amazing meal.

It's most certainly Scottish, but not as we know it Jim. Using local produce, Howies have managed to create a simply mouth watering modern and yet somehow traditional menu using Scottish classics such as Salmon and Haggis without becoming some kind of Scottish Medevil Theme Restaurant.  The restaurant itself is cozy and clean, with a brilliant atmosphere that is both buzzing and vibrant, but also intimate and close all at the same tiem.  I havent always been happy with the Howies Chain (sorry! set of four individual restaurants under the same name) but this is the nicest by a long way.",

Both myself and The OH had the same starter, Scottish smoked salmon with salad and a thai dressing.  The OH likes his meat and so his face dropped, quite noticeably, when the starters arrived and we were greeted by a mound of green with flecks of salmon scattered throughout.   For my main I had a pork chop with winter vegetables. It was tasty, but dry. Dry pork gets on my nerves so between it and the starter I wasn't too happy with Howies so far.  However, the desserts are amazing in Howies. The cream concoctions are so delicious. I'm not big on desserts but I tried some off every plate on the table! I can see why the banoffi is much loved.  I found the waitress quite casual and friendly but The OH was annoyed by her slight forgetfulness and over familiarity.  From my one experience here, Howies seems a mixed bag. I'll definitely go back as the menu is interesting and the price is right, but my rating is based on this visit.",

It has a sense of intimacy and romantic atmosphere that the other 'branches' haven't quite managed to cultivate. The menu is based around Scottish produce (Shetland salmon, Stornoway black pudding) and changes seasonally. They use organic bread from local baker Breadwinner, which is always fresh and delicious, and your first bowl is complimentary which I think is a nice touch. It would be fair to say that I've never had a bad meal here.   The restaurant is located in one of the city's prettiest streets and is perfectly situated for heading out into town after your meal, although I'd recommend that you nip across the road to the Bow Bar for a digestif first.",

The haggis starter was tasty and the main course of parsnip, pepper & something tart was delicious and filling. Finished off with the renowned banoffi pie and efficiently served throughout this was yet another enjoyable meal in a deservedly popular Edinburgh institution.",

I had a lovely and light duck salad to start, it was really tasty. My brothers both had haggis which they  said was brilliant. Haggis tends to get a bad press, most people would see it on a menu and avoid like the plague, but this version would make me order it. For main I had the special of the day, which was GORGEOUS  - venison with cabbage and potatoes in a red currant jus has never tasted so delicious. My brothers wern't too happy with their seabream (the healthy option, what did they expect) but said the banoffee pie was  delicious. The interior is lovely too, the stone walls work well. The waitress was lovely too - she was interested in the food and very helpful!",

    "text": "This is my favourite of all the Howies Restaurants. It's more intimate, friendly and comfortable, and the location couldn't be any more central.   It's reasonably well priced - especially for lunch, and the Scottish themed food is always very well presented and of good quality. Howies, while licensed, also allow you to 'bring your own bottle' if you so wish. Perfect if you're looking for a nice meal out but are looking to cut costs. Or, if you're particularly fussy about your wine and like to know what you're buying. The Howies website occasionally has vouchers available to print off for meals at reduced prices (buy two courses, get a third free etc), so it's worth checking this out before booking.   I've organised a Christmas meal for a larger group of people at Howies Victoria Street in previous years, however unfortunately I was rather disappointed. The booking time was mixed up (the restaurant wasn't ready for us when we arrived - their clock had stopped so they'd lost track of time), and as a result we had to wait for the best part of half an hour, then were rushed through our meal and hurried off the table when we weren't entirely finished, just to fit the next booking in. Whilst this wasn't a great experience - and I'd be reluctant to book Howies for a large Christmas party again, I won't let this tarnish my perception of the restaurant otherwise. Christmas is always a little hectic anyway.   Oh the whole, great food, nice settingI recommend this restaurant.",

They seem to have abandoned the fixed price menu - or had last night at any rate. It always made group bookings so much easier to manage when it came to splitting the bill. But the prices are still fairly reasonable - 4ish for a starter, 10 to 16 for a main course and 4 to 6 for desserts.   Importantly, they let you bring your own bottles which can help to alleviate the cost of eating out somewhat - particularly if you drink as much as I.   I haven't been to the Victoria Street place before. I'm a Bruntsfield girl by preference. But the food was pretty good. I had a very tasty haggis as a starter and then a half disappointing vegetable strudel which looked a little less appealing that it turned to be. And then I had some very nice cheese though oh my, the oatcakes were hard as hard cardboard.   I can't comment on the wine as we guzzled our own.   And the general decor and ambience of the place was very nice. Bustley enough to be good for groups - or pairs where conversation might be flagging.   The waitress was a bit of a sourpuss was my only criticism. But maybe she was having a bad day.",

The waitresses were all nice and took good care of the orders.  It's very female friendly.  there were two group of females having a good time together when I came in.  they had a full bar if you want to come for some drinks.  The food I would say is a little bit fusion.  I had the soup of the day, tomatoes with mint... and it was delicious.  The soup was not made from can tomatoes.  You can even taste the tart and sour flavor of the tomatoes peels.  It will be worth it to order again.  It came in two size : as an appetizer or as an entree.   So do many order dish in the restaurant.  For the main dish, I ordered the hummus wrap with chicken.  This I would say is not as impressive as the soup.  the portion is not huge.  The flavor was not as distinctive as the soup.  However, it does taste good but I wish they put a little bit more hummus so it has a little bit more flavor to it.   They currently have a promotion for a 5 pound entree.  You can check out the website for the coupons.  Overall, I would definitely come back to this restaurant because the food wasn't bad, love the atmosphere (nice in a sunny day - room was fully covered but the sun still shined through).  The price is not over the top like some other restaurants.  Good portion (i've seen someone other the burgers and they were huge!).  Very good service is another added point.    If you are around in the area, you can come and check it out.    enjoy! :)",

    "text": "This place sells poor food at high prices. Don't eat here.   My mom and I were in the Grassmarket area of Edinburgh near the Royal Mile below the Castle. We were hungry and looking for a pleasant meal and evening. Howies looks like an upscale, comfortable restaurant with 20 entrees and a selection of appetizers, so we decided to have dinner there. Unfortunately the food is mediocre, the portions small, and the service both inattentive and grudging.   I had one of the daily specials, which was a Caesar salad with chicken and bacon. When it arrived I was somewhat dismayed by the presentation: a plate with some lettuce on it. Turns out the chunks of chicken and tiny pieces of undercooked bacon were hidden underneath all the lettuce. It predictably didn't taste that great.   My mom ordered the \"Baked Fillet of Loch Duart Salmon with Herb Crust,\" for 15. It turned out to be a very small piece of salmon, with no crust. It was served with some pea sauce, which itself was quite bland and added nothing to the salmon. It was rather puzzling to see a dish that was so spectacularly unsatisfying.  In addition to the poor food, the service was bad. After dinner my mom and I both ordered tea. Hers arrived with a tea bag in the pot, but I just got a pot of hot water and someone from the kitchen with a tea bag trying to run and catch up with the server before he delivered the hot water. It would have been rather funny if it wasn't unprofessional. Similarly, I noticed one of the cooks eating a sandwich in the kitchen, which I understand is generally considered poor form, or possibly a health hazard.  I think the meal might not have been so disappointing if we had not been looking forward to a really good dinner, the type that you normally get at a well decorated, expensive restaurant. I strongly recommend that you eat somewhere else.",

Unfortunately, howies belongs to the first category and is simply average. The service was less than personal as we had 3 waiters to our table, our wine order got changed without them telling us and when I complained they said it was because they were out of the one I requested but just figured the merlot would do us fine. No apologies. Our starters were nice, well presented but our main courses were the same size as our starters, not what you expect at 20.00 a dish!   To cap it off the service charge was added to our bill and we had no way of changing it.  Too bad Howies is catering to tourists and hen parties, I am a local and I won't be back.",

The restaurant is nice and atmospheric - one night I could watch the pass from the kitchen, which was neat, and the beer suggested by the waiter was the best I'd had in Edinburgh (Stewart Ales Holyrood, for those interested). I had the soup, the stuffed chicken and a side of chips each night, and it was lovely.

Lots of good local fare, unique to visitors (like me) from the U.S. Service was great. Whiskey and beer selections were perfect and the location was amazing. A short walk to the castle.",

Blanc (great bargain for NYers), calamari and salmon. Salmon was moist and good. The breadcrumbs on top of it were good too. The calamari was crunchy and good too. 2 courses for L9.95... Great meal! I'll return the next time I am in EDI....",

On the dinner side I had haggis/nips/tattis and a pork steak over mash.  The starter was excellent, with a bacon shave over it.  The pork steak was tender, juicy and perfectly seasoned.  It went well with the green beans in bacon/butter sauce.  On the lunch side I took an all daily special set for 7.95 - spicy tomato soup was fantastic and the beef and venison casserole was delicious.  I'd highly recommend you give it a try...",

A great restaurant to go to if you want to eat some really authentic and good Scottish food (The restaurant yet still is not too touristic.)! I can only recommend it as our meal had been very delicious! I would return any time :)",

The service was a lot slower than I'm used to  (maybe that's a European thing?) but our server was extremely nice and friendly. The food was average except for the banoffee pie.  That was definitely the highlight of our meal. So delicious!",

    "text": "I ate here on my first night in Edinburgh.  It was Sunday night around 8 and the place was packed, perhaps due to Monday being a bank holiday.    The atmosphere was nice and upscale casual.  The service was not-so-great.  The food was just pretty good.  For a starter we got the haggis spring rolls.  I was unimpressed, as were my dining companions.  I would have preferred more than those two little rolls.  The haggis itself wasn't that flavorful, and the chili-jam was sweet but didn't really have much heat.  The mushroom-kidney bean pate was quite nice, however the oat-cakes were mysteriously missing from the plate. The soup of the day was quite nice.    For mains we got the salmon, pork steak, and aubergine pine nut involtini.  For the most part these were just OK.  The salmon was tasty but there was barely any of the red chili creme fraiche.  The pork steak was average, however the shallots with it were delicious.  I enjoyed the involtini.  For dessert we tried the citrus-ginger cheesecake.  I loved the concept of this, as I am a huge ginger fan and a huge cheesecake fan.  It was good but it didn't blow me away.  The presentations on the food were all very nice.  I'd give this 3.5 stars but I'll round down to three for Yelp purposes because I was hoping for a little more.",
