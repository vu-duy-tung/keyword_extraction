An excellent chippy, which has spawned an excellent Italian next door, L'Alba D'Oro (Golden Morning) is not the cheapest place to get a fish supper. But I challenge anyone to step inside, order their dish of choice, perhaps even from Mr Crolla himself, and having eaten it feel short-changed. The staff are friendly, the premises are fantastic, and the food superb.   And it's not just the food that's superb - whether you're a stout traditionalist looking for a can of 'Bru, or a connoisseur searching for a fine wine, the chances are L'Alba D'Oro will provide. That's the great thing about this place - it's a high-class establishment, but it isn't snobbish at all and is the everyday client looking for a fish'n'chips is still just as valued as anywhere.",

You can sit in or eat out, although the instore dining facilities are basically bar-style stools - nothing extravagant.

This pizzeria also serves all the takeaway food that is served with chips, and is a great place to buy a bottle of wine - they used to let you buy wine, uncork it and drink it (they'd provide the galsses) with your fish and chips as the few bar stools by the window but not sure if they do this anymore.   I love the calamari - it's cooked in a slightly spicy batter and is delicious eaten out of a paper bag while stinging hot.   The pizzeria has recently moved next door, and they have classic pizza, pasta (my favourite is the calabrese), and good value lunch specials. A 10 pizza is between 5 and 8 - but these are not your typical chippy style deep fried pizza - these are the real deal.",

When I lived in Manchester it took nearly 6 months before I found a chippy that was up to the standard that I like to call \"potatofriedheaven\".  Thanks to yelp, I have found such a place in Edinburgh within my first week.   This place had won tons of awards over the years, and rightly so. The chips are wonderful, not overly greasy but still nice and soft.  The portions aren't huge though, so be prepared to get a large!    Fish here is obviously fantastic. Freshly caught haddock that is lightly battered goes down a treat. The only negatives in my entire meal was the curry sauce that was just wrong, but you know what? The gravy was so yummy that, I'll have that instead next time - problem solved!   Not stupidly expensive but it's a little bit higher than your average... But like my Mummy always told me- you get what you pay for!",

Alas, it seems to be a one-off, or I'm coming in on the wrong days.   My further visits have been ok, but I've not been completely satisfied upon finishing my meal. It's a large portion of food but it's seriously underseasoned and bland so the large portion means nothing.   For the cost I would expect better. I don't anticipate I'll be returning given Franco's has been consistently awesome and is equidistant from my home.   Also, if you're ordering online from their store next door as well, it's so darn confusing. Why boast that you own both stores when I still need to put in separate orders on the phone and collect from each store separately? Either fix the process or don't make it a selling point.",

L'Alba D'Oro is a place I've been coming to for years and I can't understand why I haven't reviewed it before now. It's far from Princes Street and the tourist drag, but it still attracts people from all over the place due to it's reputation.  It's not your normal chippie, in that it has an amazing selection of wines and champagnes behind the counter. Read some of the amazing newspaper articles that are lovingly framed on the walls and you'll see that has become their calling card of sorts.  But I'm not a wine buff, so I'll stick to the food. I had a sausage supper, because I don't like fish. Maybe that's blasphemous to some, but I just can't cope with seafood at all. So, my sausage supper was served in a box which instantly screams class. I'm easily impressed, sue me!  The batter on both sausages was gorgeous. Just the right shade of golden brown, and managing to be chewy and crispy in equal measures. The sausages themselves were fairly big and cooked spot on. And then there's the chips... oh, the chips...  The chips are little fried slices of potato heaven. I can count 3 places in Scotland where I actively look forward to JUST the chips - here, Anstruther and Girvan - and these are very possibly my favourites. Easily the best chips in Edinburgh, even if you do nearly get salt and sauce. It's salt and VINEGAR, Edinburgh, duh!  The staff are always happy and friendly and it has the feel of a real family run business, and you know, it's just a great place to visit. There's a few seats and a ledge at the window so you don't need to walk the streets with your food, you can sit and read the newspapers on the wall, or watch the world go by out of the big windows.  I'm typing this up and I'm getting hungry again...",

Spendy for a chippy but the portions are massive, and did I mention this is one of the tastiest fish and chips I've ever had?! Fresh and nicely cooked, the fish lightly battered, the chips firm but squishy. Delivered in a cardboard box all ready to be recycled after you've devoured the contents.  They do have plenty more interesting stuff like scampi, haggis, black/white sausage, and various burgers and pies (all also a good 2 cheaper), but I tend to stick with the classic. Also not that it matters very much but the place itself is bright and welcoming, with various news clippings framed on the walls which confirm its legendary status.  One word of warning from experience - the brown sauce bottle and the vinegar bottle look very similar. Be careful what you say yes to. Yeah, let's not talk about that visit :P  Give it a go. If it helps, they also do home delivery. Though without the 10min walk and thigh-busting stairs to my 4th floor flat, I'm not sure I could justify it to my waistline!",

    "text": "I ate in here on Friday night at about 9pm when I'd been sipping in wine since 4:30.  My point is, my review might be sliiiiiiiiightly skewed by my starvation and intoxication, but not much.    When I walked in I noticed how clean, friendly, and well decorated this place is.  I know that's not exactly a must in a chippy, but a nice addition anyway.  My man wanted pizza while I was jonesing for a fish supper.  I was sent next door to get the pizza and the sweet wee woman behind the counter didn't want any of the food to go cold so she advised me to order my supper after the pizza was ready because it might take a while.  I was too hungry and just ordered and ate my supper right there, as my man waited for his pizza.  Cruel, I know.  It was divine.  I can't normally finish a fish supper because it eventually gets a bit soggy and a bit gross.  Not this one.  I took it DOWN (not at all alcohol related...).  The batter was wonderfully crispy (I'll admit I actually resorted to munching on plain batter), and the fish was perfectly moist.  I asked for extra salt and vinegar and it was doused to my heart's content.    I'll admit, I don't really recall much about the chips, because I was so busy devouring the fish, but I'm sure they must have been quite nice!  To be honest, though, the reason why this place really stands out for me is that they've joined the \"Fish Fight\" - you know, where all of those celebrity chefs are trying to get people, chippies, fishmongers and supermarkets to start branching out and trying different types of fish, and reduce the strain on overfished breeds like Haddock?  So, they have the choice of mackerel here as well.  They advertise it in a bap, but I'm assuming you can go for it as your supper if you so please.  My man and I decided that we would go mackerel next time, when we're a wee bit more with it.",

    "text": "This is the best takeaway in Edinburgh, by far! I have been going to this place for years and nowhere else comes close. It is a far cry from the usual over price grease you usually find. It is reasonably priced and they have a good selection of products on offer, from irn-bru to bottles of champagne. They have amazing vegetarian options, deep fried cauliflower being my favourite. I have and will in the future, recommend this establishment to anyone.",

    "text": "A very good pizza place in the area of Bruntsfield. My friend came here to get our girlie night-in pizza and it was quite good- not your average cardboard with cheese stuff. It's usually busy but the service is usually quite fast.   When writing this review what impressed me was their quite fancy website. Never knew chippies really got into the whole Internet stuff but hey if it means more clients fair dos.  As far as pizza places go, I would come here again.",

    "text": "Excellent fish & chips. Best if you order your fish & chips cooked to order, wherever you go, and not take ones on the side already cooked. They offer a myriad of other fried foods, as well. You can also buy wine, beer, fizzy drinks, water, etc. and ice cream to take away with you. Or you can stay and eat in the small sitting bar area to the side. A very, very popular place. A top favorite.",
