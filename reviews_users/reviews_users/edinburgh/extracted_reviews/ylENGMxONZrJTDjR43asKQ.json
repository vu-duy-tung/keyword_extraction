We were not disappointed, also, we were lucky(owners went on holiday the next day)  Location is away from tourist spots, which makes tourists like us feel like locals. Cannot wait to come back.",

    "text": "As this is also a gallery there are lots of interesting things to look at which is an added bonus.   On each visit I have really enjoyed my food. Soup with a savoury scone, what more could a girl want for lunch? Well perhaps a tasty cake. I love cake, and I have to say that this did not disappoint.  The owners are very friendly, and open to questions, including random ones like 'what's the name of the paint colour on your walls...'  If you're looking for a relaxed lunch or tea with a bit of added interest definitely head here!",

    "text": "A beloved spot of the Edinburgh Cake Ladies (indeed the owners count themselves among that growing number of Cake Ladies and Gentlemen in our fair town), Bon Papillon is part art store, part cafe, and it pulls of the mix very nicely.  Overall, we said: \"I  was very pleased with Bon Papillon and regret not having visited sooner. Today, I didn't catch them on their best soup day, but given the quality of the other two items I sampled, I have a feeling that it's usually to a much higher standard. I'll need to go back and verify that for myself (I'll let you know, when I do), but that will be no hardship, at all, as I found the place completely charming. I recommend you pay it a visit, soon.\"",
