It was a wonderful atmosphere, beginning with the walk in under the fairy lights, to the dark and Christmasy dining room.  We started off with delicious crafted cocktails.  The sazerac sent my husband well on his way to feeling great.  I ordered the Hake and lobster which was wonderfully cooked and just the right portion for the days following the Christmas feast - small but enough to satisfy. The staff was warm, inviting and knowledgeable.  I would highly recommend this non-touristy hidden gem on the Royal Mile.",

    "text": "18 months ago I was a regular customer here but hadn't visited in the last year due to moving house. My last review listed it as excellent but things have unfortunately changed.   The initial cocktails we had were good (one excellent, one average) but it went downhill from there.   The starter I had was ox cheek tortellini in a veal jus. For my 6 I got 6 small pieces of pasta containing what tasted awfully like roast beef. The jus was really a watery gravy making me think this was a micro Sunday roast packaged in a pasta style. Was quite odd and could have been a lot better if the pasta hadn't been included and the ox cheek had been braised with the jus. The food wasn't particularly warm but still edible   For the main I went for a rare loin of venison. This was meant to be served with a blackberry jus, potatoes and parsnip puree. They got most of the items right although the parsnip was a solitary roast one. The meat was cooked to perfection but had unfortunately been left to go cold and the potatoes arrived at the end of the dish yet were fridge cold in the centre. They had clearly been cooked earlier then refrigerated and partially reheated. The blackberry combination was nice although had been striped with a gravy on the plate and the two didn't work well together yet the blackberrries used as a garnish were close to frozen in the centre. Given the 22 price tag, the portion was also miniscule and after the two courses I felt I had to order a sweet to satisfy my appetielte (the portions used to be much bigger)   The two sweets we had were however the most redeeming part of the meal. The chocolate fondant was really a melting middle cake but very tasty and the rhubarb tart with Ginger beer ice cream was tasty and innovative (although the pastry slightly lacking crispness)   I'd also note the staff repeatedly pushed us to top ip glasses and order more drinks - clearly now a place making more money on the bar than being food driven and gave no apology when we mentioned the cold food just the comment of 'oh really'   Certainly wouldn't go back which is a real shame given it's previous promise. Given a 2 person bill of over 100 there are much better city centre offerings",

We had intended to have pre-dinner drinks in the garden area as it was a lovely day but the garden was closed due to a private function.   We were seated by a very friendly member of the front of house staff but the table was tucked away in a corner and the whole restaurant, although ultra chic, gave more of an impression of dark and gloomy.   The menu choices are surprisingly interesting although somewhat over-priced (24.95 Beef Wellington & 9.95 for one of the starters) The food did taste great, however, we waited 45 minutes for our main course due again to the private function being held in the garden area.   The Front of House Staff were polite, however when we settled the bill, we were not served by the same person and our complaint was pointless as nothing was actually done about it.   I think this establishment is better suited to pre-drinks events or after dinner cocktails. We gratefully left and went for coffee and dessert elsewhere !",

    "text": "Monteiths is a restaurant I have walked past on numerous occasions, and yet somehow I have never ventured down the fairylight-lit close to discover what lies within. It came highly recommended by friends and colleagues, however having read some of the reviews on this site, I was somewhat hesitant to pay a visit. Having been for dinner and cocktails, I'm glad I didn't let the reviews of my fellow Qype diners stop me going.  I feel it is necessary to give a somewhat detailed description of my evening, in the hope that those who read this review will ignore the disparaging ones posted previously.  From the moment I stepped foot down the close, and got a glimpse of the secret garden, I knew it was something special. We were greeted immediately by a waitress and offered a seat by the bar for cocktails before the meal. I am unsure whether she was psychic or could see me staring at the armchairs by the fire, but she asked us if we would prefer a place next to the fire to warm ourselves before the meal - an offer we, of course, took her up on. We were unsure of which cocktails to go for, so again she helped in our decision process by suggesting some of her preferred cocktails. They were superb! Our indecisiveness continued when presented with the menu. It all looked so delicious. I chose the confit belly of pork and my sister had the Scallops with black pudding. Both dishes were cooked to perfection, and were of a size that filled us yet left enough room for the two following courses. For the main course I had Halibut (again cooked perfectly) and my sister went for the loin of lamb. Beautiful! The desserts were equally good, the open cheesecake making me want to learn how to make cheesecake just to reproduce the dessert at home. If I have any complaint of the evening it is that although we were by the fire, the door to the smoking area was used regularly by other customers causing cold air to come in. This is, however, just a minor quibble.  Monteiths is a great find. The service and food are excellent, and the atmosphere is unmatched in this part of town. I cannot recommend it highly enough.",

When I got down the stairs the cosy welcoming restaurant felt like just my kind of place; comfy leather chairs, subdued lighting and friendly staff.  This was going to be good, or so I thought. I started with the haggis, neeps and tatties. It looks great the haggis a tiny package still in its skin resting on a nest of neeps and tatties. It was okay, but not brilliant. The haggis was lacking in flavour and felt like there was an excess of fat.  I followed with the beautifully presented cod and chips. You kind of think that if you can do anything you can at least get this staple of British dinner time right. Like the haggis, the cod was a little flavourless and that unforgivable sin of soggy batter.  This was my first time here, but it won't be my last. Every other plate on the table looked fantastic, especially the wild mushroom starter and the wood pigeon and black pudding main. I'm reliably informed they were bloody good.  I'll go back again, and hopefully have a better texperience. Watch this space...",

    "text": "I had absolutely no idea this bar and restaurant existed, such is its inconspicuous location on the Royal Mile, so when I met some friends for dinner here, I was quite delighted by the fairy light draped pathway which leads inside. I'm a sucker for fairy light enchantment, so this put me in a good mood for evaluating the rest of the experience.  The interior is very polished art deco style, modern but warm, with purple booths and comfy armchairs. Definitely good for a sly date or two, as it just has that ambience to it. The menu offers fairly classic fare but with a modern spin to it. The scallops and ginger marmalade I had to start were very, very good, as was the loin of pork I had for a main. The bottle of prosecco we ordered had a lovely flavour to it and came with strawberries to taste, which is always a nice touch. Having a meal here could prove to be quite expensive, but you can check out the menu on the website beforehand, and anyway, Monteiths is a pretty different dining experience from most establishments in Edinburgh, so I wouldn't expect prices to be rock bottom.  Coming here just for drinks is also a good call, as being slightly hidden away, you can escape the masses of revellers going to other bars in the area. The bar still gets busy at weekends though. The cocktail list has some unique concoctions on it, so if you do come in, make sure you sample one.",

    "text": "I've been waiting to review Monteiths. I love it so much I decided to go back one more time, to experience the whole thing again so it's fresh in my mind.  I love Monteiths. It's often described in tourist guides as 'Edinburgh's best kept secret' and it's not wrong! It is sitting just off the Royal Mile and can easily be missed if you don't know where it is. The fairy-lit walkway doesn't seem like much, and the steps down to the restaurant may seem a bit odd at first, but once you're down there, you're never going to want to leave.   The bar is tres chic! Very cool and all the furniture is quirky, different and kitsch. They have a very special Banksy on the wall (google him!) of Edinburgh and really cool other features - such as a plastic deer-head and a mini library!  But let's get to the good stuff. The food...ok, I hear the point that the portions are small but the food is good. After all, it's quality not quantity! It's proper good, fancy food and tastes as expensive as it is...!  My only criticism would be about the desserts - nothing mouth-watering but hey, a moment on the lips and all that. So maybe it's for the best!  Monteiths is the sort of place I would take someone visiting Edinburgh for the first time. It's a really special place, in the summertime the beer garden is beautiful - I'm having my 21st here! It's a very special place!",

    "text": "At the recommendation of Jenny, Jeanne and I had our next creme a la creme experience.  Monteiths has a wonderful charm of an entrance transporting you sneakily into the basement of a building.  Fairly lights woven into willows weave a tunnel that prepares you for your meal.  A fire was going when Jeanne and I went, and it was actually so warm we had to have the waiter turn it down, a request one doesn't have to make often in Edinburgh.  Jeanne ordered the duck liver, and I the Salmon for our entrees.  Jeanne again selected the better by far, the liver was as tender as ever falling apart and melting in your mouth, while still cooked enough to give it a rich taste.  Served on a bread it ensured all the sauce could be enjoyed.  My salmon was served on a stark slate plate with nothing added.  And it wsn't bad, I believe it was infused with gin, but in the end I had to bother the waiter with some Lemon to make it more suitable for me.  Jeanne main was pork belly which was divine.  For the american's reading this review, imagine Carolina style pulled pork.  Amazing.  Tender and and full of flavour.  My main was wood pidgeon which was nice, but could have used more of a sauce.  And in a rare event, I might have enjoyed it more if it was a bit more on the rare side.   Of the 10 people dining when Jeanne and I were there, all of them were Americans.  Which is probably due to its location on the high street.  Don't let that stop you Edinburgh, give it a go, its one of the few things on the high street that deserves to charge the mark-up.",

Our view: \"Far from being a contemporary take on Scottish cuisine, these dishes did nothing but reinforce the bad stereotypes that have too long plagued our national culinary image. Flavourless, overcooked pabulum is the only phrase that seems to adequately encompass the failings across both courses.\"  My experience was so different to those of others, both here on Yelp and from my group of friends who have also visited, that I can only conclude that it was chef's day off. Certainly, the broth and \"rare\" roast beef should be avoided when you visit, as these were the dishes I was unfortunate enough to order.   Not a place to which I will be returning.",

It was the equivalent of having one Dairylea Dunker at a picnic. I don't think we have the market for this level of pretentiousness in Edinburgh, especially with the standards of other places so close by.  It's a great bar, don't get me wrong.

My cousin had organised a family dinner, and we all pre-selected our 3-course meal from their Christmas menu prior to that evening.  It' a lovely little gem that's located just off the Royal Mile, where you will reach the entrance to the restaurant after walking down a cute fairy light-lit pathway. I had the Merry Metropolitan cocktail from the festive list, just you know, to get into the festive mood! Each of us had ordered different dishes from each of the courses so that we could have a taste of everything - sharing is caring! For the starters, I especially liked my selection which was the seared salmon - kedgeree bon bon, carrot and star anise puree. I love kedgeree, and these kedgeee bon bons were just too cute and delicious. For mains, my favourite was the duck confit - it's usually one of my favourite selections from any menu, because who doesn't love duck confit... Desserts were good as well, particularly the chocolate delice - rich, creamy and very indulgent. I can't comment on their regular menu, but overall I enjoyed their festive menu. The place was obviously quite busy and crowded considering it was around Christmas time, but it's a lovely, cosy little setting that's worth a visit.

    "text": "We had booked for an early New Years Eve dinner through Open Table and were drawn to this restaurant because of the individual dishes on the menu. When we arrived we were pleasantly surprised that they had made the extra effort and had decorated for NYE but in a classy way. The photos on the website doesn't do it justice and it has such a nice vibe. They have a great cocktail menu which we tucked into straight away. Maybe it was just me or I just picked the right ones but they were strong cocktails. Not complaining, it was refreshing to see someone actually making 'real drinks' with great flavour combos. We then had some amazing starters, the Crispy Pig Cheek Bon Bon was out of this world. Don't be fooled by its small size, it packed a punch. The mains also matched up to the great starters. The steak was nice and thick, great quality and perfectly cooked to my preference. Also the roasted honey carrots were something else. My partners venison cottage pie was also nice but was more on the small side, good job we had ordered the side. As it was NYE we did the whole hog and got desserts. Typical of me I stuck to the cheese board. Great cheeses, lots of it, nice condiments and perfect cheese to biscuit ratio. The staff were perfect that night. So friendly and attentive, always there when your drinks where nearing the end and constantly making sure your water was filled to the top. As we had booked for an early dinner our table had a time limit, they let us stay as long as we could and when our time came to leave they even offered to make space near one of the bar tables to stay longer. The perfect dinner to bring in the New Year. I would put this as my No.1 restaurant we visited during our trip in Edinburgh. A must!! (Visit - 31/12/2014 Dinner)",

Then you go down a set of stairs into the establishment.  Once in you find a nicely decorated, warm, feeling bar and restaurant that is dimely lite with dark green walls, candlelight tables.  It is small bu they make it feel inviting.  We had the rabbit and chicken liver starter which was moist not dry.  It had a little gamey taste but very pleasant.  I had the preserved duck which was cured for 3-4 days.  It was sliced thin with some nice greens, capers, and some thin slices of cured tomatoe and pickle.  The flavor has a mild pleasant smokey aroma with a sweet vinegary taste.  Very nice, I have never had anything like it.  For  our main meal we had the Lamb with sweetbreads.  That was very moist and not dry at all.  The taste was sweet, savory and it had wonderfully crispy seasoned skin. They gave three plentiful portions of Lamb more than my wife could eat.  The sweetbreads were battered and fried with a tasty and sweet flavor.  I had the bone in Rib eye steak with basil butter on top.  That was served with very nice thick cut (one inch) french fries that tasted like they were cooked in duck fat, nice and crisp yet soft in the inside.  The steak was cooked medium rare to perfection.  It was very tender and well seasoned and savory, not just a good quality meat but had some very unique flavors.  I had the chocolat mouse with blood orange sorbet.  That was a rich creamy chocolat with a refreshing sorbet.  The other desert was cinimon poached pear which rather small with frozen double cream.",

    "text": "Located just off the Royal Mile, Monteiths is very fancy pants indeed, it does seem like it's trying a little bit too hard to be cool with the cushioned walls, chandeliers and the miniature yet perfectly presented portions of food. It reminds like of a real \"ladies who lunch\" type place but having said all that, I still quite like it. It isn't as obvious as other restaurants in the area and I must have walked passed it hundreds of times before finally popping in a couple of weeks ago.  They have a lunchtime offer where you can choose any two courses off the lunch menu plus a bottle of wine for 10.95 so great if you're a lady who lunches on a budget! Even though the portions are small, the food is still delicious and there is a great selection too.  In addition to food they also have an extensive cocktail menu, there's absolutely loads to choose from, in fact one of the best cocktail menus I have seen recently. The average price for a cocktail is around the 7 which I think is quite reasonable indeed.  A nice little find, definitely a good place to visit on a girly day/night out.",

Decided to give it a second chance for a client's meeting, and although the drinks were ok, the food was pathetic, just as big a rip off again. Wouldn't mind paying if it was worth it, but think this place is just taking the mick for all it is. Cannot possibly encourage people enough to avoid this place.",

It was a fantastic recommendation: the food was very good; the atmosphere was beautiful, cozy and romantic -- don't miss the outdoor area for a cocktail, it's heated, so don't worry about the chill; the service was very good, we had a lovely young lady as our server.  She seemed new and a bit tentative at times, but our needs were ultimately met and again, she was gracious and accommodating.  I gave the restaurant four out of five stars because that while I thought the food was very good, I thought the chef could be a bit more creative with local fare, which is an outstanding source of fish and seafood.    Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Had lunch here on Saturday and really wish I hadn't.   Monteiths gets a good write up in the List Eating Guide, and has a lovely entrance. That's it.   When we went in there were a 3 or 4 Leinster fans having a an early lunch before the match. We heard them long before we saw them, but soon realised that was due to the volume of the music which was more suited to a bar at midnight and not a Saturday lunch.   We were just left standing for a few minutes while they checked if our table was ready, and seemed to be in the way of the staff. We were then seated towards the back of the bar (with a draft coming from the open door leading out to the small courtyard). We did ask for the music to be turned down, and it was, but not for long.   As we had been unable to see the lunch menu on the street, there was little on the starter menu that appealed, so we just went straight for the main course. We were served 3 micro portions of food that wouldn't have filled up a small child. There were no vegetables served with the meal, and no options on the menu to even pay for a side option. The food seemed nice enough, but unfortunately it was hard to tell due to the smallness of portion.   Overall this was a thouroughly disappointing Saturday lunch. Especially when the bill came to just under 40 for a 7.95 per head one course lunch! 5.50 for a small glass of house wine is a bit much by anyone's standards!! We will not be back.",

    "text": "I went to this restaurant today with a group, and despite the bad reviews here I actually quite liked it!   Things didn't start too promisingly when we were given a special Sunday lunch menu and told that the normal lunch menu (which had quite an interesting selection for a very reasonable price) wasn't available on Sundays, despite what was mentioned originally to the person who made the booking. It had turned out that there was an error in the original communication. However, the waitor then said \"I'll see what I can do\" and we were eventually offered the choice of the items on the normal menu, bar one or two items which weren't available in the kitchen at the time.   Admittedly service wasn't the quickest, but that was OK as we were all happily nattering away in the meantime. Also the food, when it arrived, was well worth the wait - beautifully presented and marvellously cooked.   The interior is an interesting mix of glam, Scandinavian style designer furniture and traditional Scottish homeliness that works quite well, giving the place a unique character.   A word of note: (as another mentioned) it isn't the easiest of places to spot - look for the tables and the big \"M\" above the alleyway, a couple of doors down from the Carubbers Close entrance on the Royal Mile.",

    "text": "This is one of those rare occasions where a three-star evening was pulled into the four-star range by the sheer will of a good staff member.   A few week's back, with a visiting Canadian cohort in tow, I met up with Caz H at Monteiths for a night of drink, food and chat. Honest to gosh, Monteiths hadn't even landed on my radar until Caz suggested it... for the most part, I avoid places on the Mile like the plague, but the reviews seemed complimentary and the cocktails looked good, so why the heck not?  First off, the entrance alone is going to make this a repeat experience. It's one of those entrances that I love bringing visitors too - a turn down a little alley, a fairy light adorned tunnel and a short walk down a nondescript set of stairs, through an unmarked door to a cute and cozy little underground restaurant... very Edinburgh show-offy. Though not a cocktail gal myself, my visiting Canuck is a big fan, so I was happy to see an interesting and diverse cocktail menu.  Interrupting gush session: three or four stars aside, if this review was purely based on the cocktail list, it would be an easy five stars. Whoever is behind that cocktail menu has officially hit bar ninja status, not only for mixing some wonderfully balanced cocktails but for offering libations less on the sweet side. The thyme negroni? This cocktail convert salutes you!  So yes, the cocktails more or less went over exceptionally well...  So onto the food: We started with the grilled squid and a bread plate. Honestly, next time I come here, I would stick to starters or the small plates menu that seemed to be kicking around the bar. Hands down, the squid was the best part of the meal.  For my main, I ordered a rare steak and here's where we get into the three star category. First off, they mixed up Caz & I's order and she received the rare whereas I got her medium rare. Easy enough fix but I still feel a bit bad for doing a switcharoo as mine looked closer to medium. Not an extraordinary mistake but a bit of a pest as we had both dug into our food when we realized it.  Second, the steak was...ok. It's not one i'll be writing home about and though I happily finished my plate, I would be hesitant to drop 25 on their ribeye option again. Overall, it was a dinner with a fairly hefty price tag that was a little wishy washy.  So why would I return? Because aside from an iffy steak and a hefty price tag, the service here was top notch. Our server was attentive, cheerful and hilarious. We were plunked at our table for well over two hours and he was a doll throughout. Especially on the Mile, this isn't something you find often and it was refreshing not to have to lean awkwardly to get someone's attention while deep within tourist town. So Mr. Googly Eyes, I tip my hat to you. Service ninja status indeed.  So my recommendation? Go for the cocktails and share small plates (or start the night here). I'll definitely be back to give the mussels a go.",

We were sat promptly at a very cramped table with not much room to manoeuvre but luckily the table next to us left soon after we arrived and our awesome (Aussie? Kiwi?) waiter moved us across. Even then the table was small but a least we had some breathing room between us and other diners.  We started with some bacon, calamari and prawn/crayfish to share which was all very nice and reasonably priced. I did find the menu a little uninspiring and there wasn't much I wanted so I went with my standard; steak.  The steak was cooked well and came with chips and a nice bearnaise sauce. Not the best rib eye I have had, especially the build up they give it on the menu about  where they source their meat from etc but it was still pretty good. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals (the girls had the lamb and my friend  had the Ox Cheek - which looked the best of the bunch). We split soe sides which were a little on the small side so I'd recommend ordering 1 per person and sharing.",

    "text": "Who can resist a nice, juicy steak? Not me, that's for sure!  Monteith's is one of those places I've passed by many a time, intrigued by the arches of branches and fairy lights that lead down to it from the Royal Mile, but I'd always assumed it was a little out of my price range. Which it is, for the most part. However, when an itison voucher appeared in November for rib eye steaks, chips, a 250ml glass of wine plus coffee and petit fours for two for the very reasonable price of 34 I snapped it up.  As often happens I left it to the last couple of weeks of the voucher's validity to use it, but it meant that my boyfriend and I could enjoy a treat on an otherwise unremarkable Saturday.  I booked a week in advance, so was a little disappointed to see we had the table right next to the stairs down into the restaurant and right next to a plant - the plant was so obtrusive it rendered one of the seats at our table unusable. But apart from where we were sitting (and it wasn't so bad, as at least we weren't right next to anybody else, and I had a great view of the bar), the interior is really lovely. It's all muted tartan in earthy colours and animal skulls, modern Scottish I guess you'd call it (have they been decorated entirely by Anta?).  The staff are young and decidedly cool (check the bartender's massive beard).  We were one of several tables using a voucher, so there was a slight wait for our food, but nothing outrageous for a busy restaurant. We were offered a choice of two wines, a Chardonnay or a Merlot, with us both plumping for the Merlot (of course, red wine and steak!).  For what is presumably the house red, it was lovely! I was really surprised just how nice it was, and also very glad to see a voucher deal offering a 250ml serving (though it looks small in the glass as those things are huge!).  And the food itself was really, really good. A nice sized rib-eye, which would normally have cost 22. There was fat in it, but not so much that I ended up cutting more off than I ate meat (as I've had in other restaurants).  And I was delighted to see that it was indeed medium, not medium rare, not medium well, just medium.  In fact my boyfriend opined that it was better than Kyloe's. Chips were few but they were those mega brick sized ones so their volume more than made up for their number. And whilst the bearnaise maybe could have done with a smidge more seasoning, it was still the perfect accompaniment.  Coffee was good, although the petit fours were about half an inch long and there was only one each - a tiny square of something chocolatey. It was very nice, but miniscule (I know they're petit fours, but really these were teeny).  I'm too poor to come to Monteith's regularly, but should they ever have a deal again I'll snap one up!",

The restaurant itself does not seem to have windows so a bit drab. They make interesting cocktails albeit in small portions. I ordered a dirty martini which wasn't dirty enough. The waitress offered to make a new one. The glass used to serve the martini was tiny.   The food was excellent. I ordered a chicken Brest stuffed with langoustine meat with an excellent white gravy and a whole langoustine with the chicken. I never had a chicken and langoustine combination which was intriguing.   The downside was the service. While friendly, the service was very slow. Go if you have time and no agenda otherwise it may be painful to sit there and wait for single tasking staff to go through service.",

We had a fantastic server and that was extremely helpful, honest and didn't necessarily recommend the most expensive meal when given a choice.  THE BAD: I asked for the steak to be cooked \"medium\" though it arrived \"rare\". The peppercorn sauce was bland.  John Dory fish dish was drown in sauce and had a fishy odor.  Mussels were overcooked, small and had a fishy odor.  Seafood stew had a fishy odor.  THE UGLY: The mussels, seafood stew and John Dory fish dish all had a very fishy odor. While I can understand one seafood dish possibly having a fishy smell, when 3 of 4 have a poor odor, that is concerning. The only seafood dish that had no odor and was decent were the oysters. Makes me wonder how fresh their seafood is upon arrival.  OVERALL IMPRESSION: We asked a local for recommendations on where to eat dinner for a True Scottish meal and local flair. While she was correct on a welcoming atmosphere and good drinks everything else was a miss. We would not recommend visiting this restaurant as there are many others to choose from. If you want well priced whiskey there are a plethora of additional taverns to visit that offer a wider selection.",

Then you are welcomed by staff and candlelight. We ordered our Christmas menu in advance, such the service and flow of food was very well organised.  I ordered Brianleith Cheddar for a starter, which was served as a type of spring roll, but a few of us commented on the fact that we felt it did not taste anything like cheddar. The turkey as a main tasted deliciously and was presented in a way I never came across before when it comes to Christmas turkey. The dessert was a warm and sweet sticky toffee pudding. The ice cream tasted a bit too watery for me, but overall I would definitely order it again.   The prices are on the higher side, but if you take out your loved ones and colleagues alike, they wont be disappointed.  Merry Christmas everyone!",

We were moved from our original table as it was very busy so that was less than ideal. But the excellent service after this more than made up for the earlier inconvenience.  The puddings were especially yummy",

    "text": "Quite an enjoyable Christmas lunch was had here last week with my boyfriend albeit I felt slightly rushed away from our table before the coffee arrived which I got miffed about (no prior warning!) especially as I'd spent 60 on a bottle of champagne to make it a special occasion! Mollified slightly by being escorted to some seats at the bar area. Harrumph.... Apart from that the service was speedy and friendly and they had the champagne waiting for me on arrival as requested. Tick.   Food-wise, portions were possibly a bit small upon first glance however we both felt satisfied and it's kinda nice leaving a restaurant not feeling overly stuffed. If my dad had been with me however.... Oh no.... He would have complained about the size of the turkey main....  I'd bought an itison voucher for a 3 course lunch and petite fours. Overall, extremely good value and I didn't feel like they'd skimped at all with the quality (you know how much of a rage I get into when that happens!!). My baked cheddar starter turned out to be a big spring roll looking thing filled with unidentifiable vegetables and a small amount of cheese. Tasty, though didn't match the description on the menu. The turkey ballotine was yummy! The ju was possibly a bit overly salty however as a salt fan it hit the mark with me. Would have loved a couple of extra roasties but that's cos I'm a greedy sod! My dessert choice was the cheeseboard, his was the sticky toffee pudding. Tick, tick. Only gripe was the disproportionate quantity of oat cakes versus cheese however the 3 cheese offerings (cheddar, blue and Brie) were of a  generous size and the red and green grape chutney was an excellent accompaniment.   Would recommend and I'd buy a voucher from there again! Have a chat with the beardy bar man! He's really knowledgable about his  gin and where you can buy the more unusual bottles in Edinburgh.",

Everything was fantastic and the the service was great! Our waitress was so polite and kind. She was attentive and very quick to get us our food and drinks. The atmosphere is a welcoming, relaxed, warm and fun. Loved it! You HAVE to stop here for a meal if you're in Edinburgh. It's conveniently located on the royal mile, so it's the perfect place to get something before walking up to the castle. Cheers!",

    "text": "I've been here for drinks a lot over the last three years or so and had differing opinions virtually everytime but the place's quirky interior and range of cocktails have always lured me back. Now that the music policy and volume seem to have reached a sensible point (no blaring hardcore hip-hop) and the rather manic head barman seems to have moved on I think it can go on to greater things. And as I've for some reason failed to review it up till now having finally sampled the food it seems time to redress that.   Deciding that drinking on a palindrome earned double points (and having a hankering to take up the bar's bottle of vodka with limitless trimmings deal) half a dozen of us trooped along on 01/02/2010. As this was a Monday night we ended up being the only customers for the bulk of our time there. I doubt that had any bearing on the service but that was uniformly courteous and swift either way. The bottle of Finlandia in an ice bucket at the end of the table was a roaring success and no one had any complaints about their dishes, which included hare with pumpkin puree, black pudding with beetroot and poached quails eggs, haggis linguine and a very enjoyable cheesecake with strawberries dessert. 22 for three courses if having the table d'hote and the a la carte was slightly dearer obviously.   We'll be back again on 20/10/2010 and I'm looking forward to it.   Visited again sooner than expected (April 12th) and things seem to have changed as far as the bottle to the table goes. Smirnoff Black is now the vodka of choice and you certainly notice the slight change in strength. Mixers have unfortunately gone from individual bottles to jugs from the gun (and bizarrely Tonic's no longer available inclusively). You're still probably getting vfm but less so than two months ago.",

    "text": "I really liked this place and I'll explain myself in a minute but first to the good bits.  Monteiths caught my eye a year or so ago, I came here for a few cocktails and though we ended up sitting outside I enjoyed it so I couldn't wait to come back for some food.  *Cue violins* Unfortunately, I'm a poor student who can't afford fancy things! Roll on an Itison voucher that came up back in March. The OHs birthday was coming up and I had the chance to spread the cost of a fancyish meal over two paychecks. The voucher was for two steaks, two glasses of wine, coffee and handmade petit fours so I was well up for it.  Last night we finally used the voucher. I started with cured duck, served with orange and some delicious figgy stuff. Not a huge portion but it felt just right, if a little bland. Across from me, the starter of haggis was carefully consumed, as it came in a pretend sheeps stomach that it had to be pushed out of. I had a taste and it was mild but very good.  For mains, shocker we had the steak. Served with duck fat chips and some vine tomatoes, we both had the peppercorn sauce. I ordered rare and I got rare, which is so...wait for it...rare these days (AHAHAHAHAHA!) Ahem. After we had our coffees and I had a vanilla panna cotta which was delicious, though there was a lot of it. With panna cotta less can definitely be more.   The service was excellent throughout the meal and our waiter seemed like a really nice guy. So why the three stars?   Well, the music alone should bring it down a star but my issue was after the meal. When it came to the bill there was an extra 22 odd added on, specifically for a glass of wine and a bottle wine, neither of which were ordered. I said grand, and went up to the till to correct the mistake. When I said this to the lady at the bar she, in front of me, asked our waiter if we had ordered this bottle of wine and he said yes. She asked if he was sure and he said yes. She then said she was going out the back to 'count it', count what I don't know, possibly wine bottles.   I'll be honest I was a bit mortified, I would expect this in your average run of the mill place but not in a place that has Remy Martin on the menu for 80 quid. Some discretion would have been nice, not a blatant distrust. To their credit they apologised, after confirming they had in fact not sold us the wine.   Being absolutely scarlet at the whole thing I don't think I'll be back, not that I can afford it but if I am to spend my millions of pennies it'll be elsewhere.",

I wanted somewhere that wasn't hoaching with tourists. \"There's no such place\" said the OH ... Then I remembered Montieth's.   Hidden down a wee alley, it's easy to miss. The fairylights are a clue that you're in for a treat if you take a gander down. There's a lovely outdoor area & inside a cosy bar & restaurant. Lots of dark paneling & tartan but in a tasteful stately home kind of way rather than tacky tourist-Ville.  We almost had the place to ourselves. There was one small group of ladies having cocktails at the bar.   The cocktail menu is great and the bar staff know their drinks. I asked for a gin cocktail & after being asked a few questions to find out my likes & dislikes the apple bramble swizzle was recommended. It was delicious & went down a treat. I could've had another but I didn't want to turn up to the photo exhibition a wee bit tipsy ;-)  The last time we were here was in the winter. The fires were lit & it was a Cody retreat from the winter weather raging outside.   This place is a definitely a secret worth keeping.",

    "text": "Been here several times before and I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt before reviewing.. they lost. It is such a nice - secluded - location. You go down the steps through an alleyway of crowned greens(ivy?) filled with twinkling fairy lights. First thing you see is their 'outdoor' smoking area and you may miss the actual entrance leading you to the basement of the building. There is the large and well stocked bar and 2 big high back easy chairs as a semi lounge area. Cosy. The furniture is deliberately mismatched - a bit too conscious about that, not the effortless mismatch I noted in other places.  As we were a party of two we (like last time) were asked to take place in the pass through area - were everybody will be passing - waiters, guests coming and leaving.. which I declined this time and asked for a table which has less traffic. We were supplied - good - close to the fireplace.  This was an 'Voucher Visit' for lunch. Meaning we had to order the starter, main and dessert in one order. We were supplied water laced with cucumber and grapefruit. This is not my favourite fruit but it does made the water taste different.  The meal was served promptly and the staff was a little rushed but efficient and very friendly. I was (as with my former visits) not impressed with the food. There is essentially nothing wrong, but nothing really wowed me as I wanted it to be. There was not enough taste. There was not enough presentation, rather under presented. The portions are not enough. - We had the braised beef and white beetroot with trimmings and gravy. The beef was falling apart which I was pleased about, but no taste. The gravy was barely there and my wife had to ask for more. The trimmings were: 1 sprout, 1 baby potato, 1 turnip (undercooked) 1 baby carrot, 1 mini 'pig in blanket' and on the plate and the trimming bowl we had loads of curly kale (blanched) - who are you kidding?  Dessert was rolypoly and coconut ice-cream and a my wife had a chocolate cake & mandarin cake.  The actual dessert was a chewy rolled poly with jam and vanilla ice-cream covered in coconut flakes, chocolate cake with 2 mandarin parts and a cream cocktail thingy. all nicely presented, all without the mmmm I like this factor. It was all..nice, pleasing, non offensive.   Will I go back, actually yes I will. I have such hopes for this place- every time they show us that there is potential, but so far I have been left hanging, wanting for that dish to wow me.   NOTE: there is NO wifi or mobile phone signal when in the restaurant - is that a good or bad thing .. I am still unsure. But I understand the no distractions idea of that.",

I could blame it on the cooks, sure, but I could also blame it on the staff polishing glasses or just generally enjoying each other's company at the expense of the customer experience.  I had to give multiple hard stares to any server as they passed our table multiple times to get anything I wanted.  Logic = drink running dry, offer another one does not apply here.  I had no silverware at all on my table when my main course was delivered, but I'm sure my overcooked filet (forgotten sauce) needed additional time to rest.  That said... my server touched his face, head, nose, etc, constantly and had zero situational awareness, so I was crossing my fingers the silver would be delivered by someone else.  The expo/food runner noticed first and delivered silver.  She was quite the multi-tasker and must be frustrated at the unequal work loads and inept co-workers.  The above-mentioned server did not have a working pen when he approached my table, and forgot his wine tool when he delivered a bottle to the neighboring table.  Sub-par was as good as he gets. We waited extra-long for someone to ask us if we were interested in the desert menu delivered to us.  We were, but lost interest and just wanted out and had to flag a girl down to request the check.  The chick we asked continued to work around us for longer than necessary to believe she intended to deliver a check, so we busied ourselves with our coats, hats and so on to make it more obvious WE were ready to get moving... if only we had a check.  That plan also failed... YET WHEN WE ROSE FROM OUR BOOTH SHE STOPPED ME, to ask if I had paid (the first time anyone noticed us without having to initiate contact first), concerned I was a dine and dash.  I remarked we were on our feet in search of our check, thanks.  Ok food, generally poor service.  If they fixed the service I would consider giving it another shot.",

They melted in my mouth.  Also ordered the steamed halibut. It was so moist and delicious. Other people at the table ordered the clam chowder, roast chicken, and lamb. All of it was amazing!",

Bartenders were super and we loved our table. I ordered the seafood chowder (to die for!) and the lobster. The service was the best. I highly recommend this place!!",

Cocktails to start with risotto, then the steak with a sub of mashed potatoes instead of two duck fat fries (not too much horseradish flavor- almost didn't get mash because of that, so glad we ordered them!). Wine with the steak- just wish we had room for dessert. Absolutely recommend!",

    "text": "The beautiful archway outside lures you downstairs into the dinner from hell that awaits you below.  There really is a nice ambiance to the entire setting.  The archway, the rustic interior, the cozy outdoor courtyard... and once the sun sets they even keep the lights real dim so that it is nice and romantic and the rest of us can't see a flipping thing.  So I start by ordering the \"Filet of Beef Carpaccio.\"  The description of the appetizer I will quote directly from the menu: \"roast onion mayo, pickled summer vegetables\" Sounds great.  The veg turns out to be fennel, radishes, and carrot shavings.  No thanks.  I push these off to the side to reveal a teaspoon of the mayo concoction - also a let down.  It's strangely sweet and rather thin.  Okay, so I'll just eat the beef.  I would have, too, if the taste of the fennel hadn't seeped into beef, making it so that the fennel was all you could taste.  But hey, sometimes dishes aren't for everybody.  That's okay.  Rather than being a gracious host with smiles and apologies, the waitress gives me a shocked look when I tell her that the appetizer is just not for me.  She asks what is wrong with it, and I politely just say that I'm not a fan of fennel.  Her face sours, and she mutters about how fennel was clearly marked on the menu as she stomps away.  Color me infuriated at this point.  It was NO WHERE on the menu, Miss Snarky, and neither was your attitude!  I unfortunately have to stay and receive my main course - one of the specials of the night: lobster with a side of duck fat chips.  Thank god for these chips with the unappetizing title - they were delicious, and without them, I would have starved.  The lobster was yet another let down, spiced with a cloying sweetness that built the more you ate.  Also, be prepared for the wait staff to overestimate your appetite if you are American.  She advised us to order more sides, saying that one appetizer of mussels would not be enough for two, and one side of duck fat chips would not be enough for my husband to try some of mine.  One serving of each of these was more than enough!  None of us are large people.  Just because we're American doesn't mean we're pigs.  In summation, the waitress was rude, the food was sub-par, and the environment was nice but much too dark.  I wouldn't go back.",

The smoked salmon was divine and our steaks were tender and cooked perfectly (and we are picky Texans when it comes to beef). Highly recommended! Best to get a reservation-it is small and was very busy. Dress was smart casual.",

Most of all, the entire staff is extremely friendly and helpful.",

We decided we wanted after-dinner drinks during our night in Edinburgh, and were drawn in by the fairy-lights at the entrance.  Surprisingly, we were able to snag an open table at the bar on a busy Saturday night.  The drink menu is huge, and very well put-together.  They have a vast selection of craft cocktails as well as top-shelf liquors, whiskies, etc.  I tried a drink called the \"mead cobbler,\" a lovely concoction including mead, bitters, and pomegranate juice.  My husband of course ordered Scotch whisky, and was very pleased with the selection-- he was able to order something he hadn't tried before.  The ambiance is fantastic, and the food I saw go by looked delicious.  This visit was spontaneous, but I'd definitely plan a trip here on purpose next time I find myself in Edinburgh.",
