    "text": "First time in Edinburgh, so of course we go to an Italian place! Logic, A+.   Anyways, this place is absolutely fantastic. Somewhat small, but plenty of tables and a great atmosphere. Clean, modern, and doesn't feel crowded. Staff are very friendly, helpful, and are easily accessible but not overbearing in the slightest! Food was delicious (spaghetti marinara with seafood and white wine sauce was excellent, as was the lasagna al forno), and the tiramisu is fantastic. 10/10 would recommend. Bon appetit!!",

    "text": "Sluuuuurp! Ah, the slippery joy of a good plate of spaghetti alle vongole. I can report that Sambuca does the best spag vongole I've had since Italy. It should be easy to make - its just clams and spaghetti, really - but I've had some real rubbish.   Sambuca's spaghetti is spot on - nicely al dente, just enough olive oil and garlic, and topped with a happy pile of fresh clams.   My friend had vegetable lasagne that looked good too - though I realise now that I was too busy shovelling pasta into my mouth to ask...  Anyway, yes, it's a good place. The watiress was lovely, it's a nice bright modern cafe - all very good.",

    "text": "Sambuca is a lovely little Italian restaurant on Edinburghs Causewayside.  Sambuca specialises in traditional Italian fish and steak dishes, but with a modern twist - the restaurants namesake drink is poured onto the dish and set alight as your meal is being served - a Truely wonderful sight. However, as to be expected, this often leaves an odd aniseed taste, which has only worked with around half of the dishes I have eaten at Sambuca. That said, food is very delicious and well priced.  If you are willing to ignore the need for a decorater, Sambuca is a nice restaurant to go to for somehting a bit different.",

    "text": "From the outside, Sambuca looks a bit run down and could probably do with getting redecorated inside as well.  However, this certainly doesn't reflect the quality of the food and service which the place has to offer.  The staff are welcoming and friendly, whilst the restaurant's general atmosphere is relaxing and chilled out.  They pride themselves on serving authentic Italian cuisine and aim to specialise in seafood.  Consequently, some of it is a bit expensive, but it's all delicious, filling and tastes just about no time to arrive.   I opted for the Spaghetti Marinara which had a whole range of seafood, from squid to clams, in a white wine sauce.  I would definitely come here again, and Sambuca offers great food and service in a pleasant atmosphere.",

I had seafood marinara, one of my fave dishes. It was lovely. Nephew had a stagione pizza which looked lovely. My father had minestrone soup which he enjoyed. A  very nice little Italian and very reasonably priced. Would definitely go back . House red was also very drinkable.",

If your on death row and they decided to give you your last meal from here, you need to get the Gamberoni. You have never tasted king prawns this meaty before and the sauce is excellent (Garlic and Basil I think). We were given 2 glasses of wine by our very nice waiter on the house and the total bill came under 25.!",

I came here on a date, and even though the tables are a bit too small and crammed in, I really liked the mixed seafood pasta I got and would gladly come here again. The waitress who served us was friendly too. I have only come here for lunch, when there is no lighting-dishes-on-fire practice. I have seen them alight at night though- quite entertaining! If there is a big group of you I would strongly suggest booking a table, as space is limited. Also tables are quite close together and there is little space on the tables for dishes.",

    "text": "For a small, local Italian restaurant you can't do much better. The food here is of a much higher quality than many of the bigger and more central restaurants and they do some great lunch deals too. The only thing that lets them down is that the atmosphere can be a little static and the lighting a little harsh - but one has to be forgiving when they're serving up food as tasty as this. It's all warming, rustic and authentic tasting. You cant really go wrong. But I would recommend filling up on starters and mains, as the puddings are a tiny bit disappointing and tasted 'bought-in'. But who wants tiramisu, when you can stuff yourself with the tastiest pizzas I've had in a long time?!",

Great deal for two course when we went for lunch. Food was nicely presented and traditional. Decor despite being fairly new was a wee bit drab/inexpensive. Would like to go back for a meal in the evening and see what it has to fully offer.",
