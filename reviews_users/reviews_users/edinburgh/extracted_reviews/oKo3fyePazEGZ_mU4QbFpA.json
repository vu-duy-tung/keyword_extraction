    "text": "From the outside this branch of KFC looks like a kiosk, but as soon as you walk in you see the sign 100 extra seats down stairs what real use is that if they close it off after 6pm. Majority of the staff here look scruffy gone the days and the tv adverts showing a guy or girl with clean ironed shirt & hat. They do have free wifi but never seems to work. The price of the boxed meals have gone up 1 since l last ate at one of these places.",

    "text": "Dropped by this KFC for a quick bite yesterday. Though there were lots of people waiting for their orders, mine came out within 5mins which is good coz it was getting warm with all the people waiting for their orders. We were offered water as we wait for our orders which was very kind of them. Though the place is small, it is clean. The counter is free from the typical mess that you would find in a fastfood countertop. The staff were all friendly and smiling.",

It had obviously changed hands since I had been last & a great improvement I must say. Well worth dropping in for a tasty snack.",
