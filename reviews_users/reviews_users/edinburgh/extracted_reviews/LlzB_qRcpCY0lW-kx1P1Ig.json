    "text": "Nice soups and sandwiches - using it a lot when i work in the area.  They have cheap soups and hot lunches. Seems homemade (i am not really sure) and the choice changes daily. Lots of different rolls and sandwiches.  Very quick service and always friendly.  Get there before 12:30 as the soups start to be sold out and you will be stuck with \"cream of mushroom\" and \"tomato\" ;-)",

    "text": "So narrow, it's really just a corridor, Club Sandwich boasts Edinburgh's widest selection of soups (probably) with a daily choice of eight. The soup I tried, a potato and Double Gloucester, was absolutely excellent. Their rolls were very good, too, so I'd highly recommend a visit.  Overall, we said: \"it's another one in the win column for Dundas Street. Given that they have a branch of the New Town Deli, just round the corner, this little parade of shops now boasts three \"exceptional\" Soupquest soups, giving solid credence to the notion that this is may be emerging as a second Edinburgh \"soup district\". I know that the area near to the university, with Union of Genius, Elephant Juice and Peter's Yard had been, to my mind, Edinburgh's home of soup, but there is definitely a pretender to the crown. Vive les quartiers de soupe, I say.\"",
