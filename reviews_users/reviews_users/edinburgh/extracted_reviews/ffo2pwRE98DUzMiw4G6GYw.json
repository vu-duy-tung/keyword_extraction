    "text": "I see you shiver with antici... ... ... pation.  This quote superbly describes this past week, as I skipped past, smushed my face against the window and all out stalked their website waiting for Ruan Siam's new sister restaurant Street Box to open.  Did I learn about this little spot because I was taken aback when Ruan Siam was closed for a week during the launch? Yes. Was a week without thai take away worth it to have this little outpost right around the corner? Heck to the yes. The Lazy Gal default setting is strong in this one.  Here's what we know so far:  This tiny (and I mean TINY) place is run by the same folks that own Ruan Siam just up the street.  They have expanded the menu and offer delivery between 6pm - 10:15pm seven days a week.  They have one picnic style table and bench seating to sit in. It's small but they've done a good job with the space.  They have quick meal boxes for those looking for great lunch take away in the area and are open in the afternoons.  The new menu items like Pad Kee Maow (spicy rice noodle stir fry with Galangal, lemongrass, chilli and mixed vegetable) are deliciously on point.  Their curries are still as bad ass as they were when Ruan Siam was dishing them out.  I will be here ALL the time.  More options for great thai food? Win.",

    "text": "I love Thai food and chanced trying this place waking by.  It seemed busy with away orders.  It's small inside with one table and two areas against a wall and window. I tried the Pad Prig with chicken and rice because I like the spicy and tangy description and it was a 'new' item. Service was friendly and super fast.  Unfortunately,  I was disappointed in the food as it was much too salty. Perhaps it was catering to Western tastes but having been to Thailand several times, I know what good Thai tastes like. Thought it was dear as well for what it was.  I won't be going back..",

    "text": "The most exciting thing about moving is exploring your new 'hood and finding new local haunts. As a new Stockbridge resident, I was excited to try some local takeaway options.  First on my list was Street Box.  I'm a fan of Thai and a fan of milder creamier curries especially. Throw in a coconut base and that's my idea of heaven right there. So, my glance over the menu was a quick one. - The Kaeng Sangtong was going to be all mine; yellow curry with coconut milk, potato and peanut topped with crispy onion. YES! And a side portion of coconut rice. Yes, please!  My dinner dreams had well and truly come True and the Kaeng Sangtong was a flagrant, delicious delight, leaving me more than fulfilled. The crispy onions on top were a nice little extra and there was the perfect amount of sweetness and heat. Portion size was good and I was able to have the leftovers for post-work dinner the following night. That's always a bonus!  Service was bubbly and bright; just the kind that has you back for more. - That, and the beautiful Thai flavours are tempting me back!",

    "text": "Yay, new Thai take-away in Stockbridge. It's effectively the new location of Ruan Siam, with less of a dining room and more of a take-away and delivery focus. Our order was ready after a very brief wait, and we whisked it home to devour it. Everything was tasty, and portion sizes were reasonable.   At 27 for a veg pad thai, a curry, and a soup, it was on the expensive end for take-aways, which is about the only negative I can think of.",

    "text": "I was in town visiting a friend, and she lived quite close to this new little spot and for days had been begging me to stop in with her and try it out because I had heard their sister restaurant was THE BEST.  We popped in one day and for such a tiny little space it's laid out quite well and contains a fair amount of seating without being cramped and is really bright and has an airy feel. There were already a few groups of couples eating and waiting on food and it smelled dang delicious.  I'm a pretty big skeptic of most Thai places having lived there, and living in Canada where people's palates are not necessarily looking for authentic.  This place hit the spot. The spices were incredible and rich, and the servings quite large even for take away!   We ordered a bunch of items to try them out, and all of them were wonderful. They even gave us shrimp chips (I am a sucker for these!)   Ok, now I'm hungry again.....",

The portions were very generous - you could easily have left-overs with the main dishes. Staff were friendly, approachable and responsive. Quite a small location, so be prepared to take away if you don't find free seats.",
