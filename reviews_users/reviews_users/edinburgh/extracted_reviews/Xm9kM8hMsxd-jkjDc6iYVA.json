They did not have a vegetable dish available, but the nice woman made us a fresh salad - tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers which we desperately craved.  This is a solid place.  Nice atmosphere, good variety of quick eats done well.  Highly recommend!",

    "text": "This was a welcome site when we first arrived in Edinburgh. We came toting heavy luggage, just off the bus from the airport,  and were waiting to check into our airbnb. I had yelp-searched a few breakfast spots and we were gonna lug our bags UP the Royal mile, but then Macintyres happened to catch my eye. Travel weary, we lugged our suitcases inside, and tucked them under a table (the place is small and in the entrance to a hostel).  Now this little cafe set the bar high for our first meal in Scotland.  We ordered at the counter and sat down.  The place is cute, with a few tables, a counter and stools facing the busy street and a guest book to write/doodle in. They sell different coffee/breakfast drinks, bagels, sandwhiches, and bakery items. We ordered a flat white, hot chocolate, salmon bagel and haggis bagel.   We were served by a young Sam Heughan look-alike and enjoyed our beverages. Our bagels were delicious  (and affordable)! We halfed them to share and though I was expecting a lox type texture, the salmon (more on the cooked side) was great. My hubby's haggis bagel was some of the best haggis on the trip (he ate it almost everyday) and was meaty and spiced inside a seeded bagel.   We returned the next morning and after watching a group of guys (probably post stag party-they were all over the city!) Order the (square) sausage in a  roll, we followed suit. \"Tomato sauce (ketchup) or brown sauce?\" What is brown sauce? Like a spicy wosterchire like katsu sauce....after that morning I was hooked and ended up using it throughout the trip and buying a bottle of HP to take home. The sausage rolls were a great on-the-go breakfast and very affordable, on a couple pounds.  Highly recommend this cafe to warm up on a chilly Scottish day or a quick, affordable breakfast on the Royal Mile.",
