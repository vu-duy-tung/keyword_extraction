    "text": "My daughter dragged us across the street to Martone initially because she desperately needed a potty stop (lol), but that quickly changed when we saw the gelato.  We happily turned this into a quick gelato and wine stop .. wine for me, gelato for everyone else. Prices are super reasonable and the gelato was fantastic. Their dessert menu has a lot of great looking things to choose from and the kids (hubby too!) were happy with their choices.",

    "text": "We're just 3 mins. away from our hotel, but the GPS gave us the run-around, which took us 15 mins. longer to get there!  (I was concerned, I wouldn't be able to hike back up those hills, luckily it wasn't to be).  The minute we walked in, I spotted a table for two, so I pointed to the staff 'could we take that?' but she was saying something, ' . . . like an hour, but - pointing upstairs.' Because it was noisy, it wasn't really clear what she was trying to tell us. So, I said again:  \"Could we sit there?\" Then she said, louder & clearer: \"It would take at least an hour's wait for anyone to sit there, but there's table available upstairs.\" So, we said:  \"OK.\" I didn't care where we sit, really, we just want a place to eat and we picked YOUR restaurant, because we want Italian food tonight.  Our waitress was very nice & friendly, and we got our order right away. I like the fact, that we have a good window view of the Clock of Balmoral Hotel (not sure if it was, correct me please) behind me.  I wanted to take a photo to add to my collection, but there's so much fog on the arch glass.  I ordered the Steak Sandwich Wrap and hubby ordered the Sea Bass.  I ate half of his & he ate half of mine, so we both get to taste, they were excellent!  But we're so full!   Our waitress was wearing a T-shirt on the back that says: Martone Award Winning Ice Cream. Decided to order the Minibocker Glory, and I TOLD HER, we usually don't order desserts when we're full, but is it OK, if I order the child size so I could taste what an award winning ice cream taste like? She said, sure!  A few minutes later, her boss, the manager maybe? Came by to deliver not the child size but the Knickerboker Glory (adult size 3 pounds more). I thought there was some mistake, so I told him, 'I wanted just a taste of your ice cream, because . . . .' INTERRUPTING ME, saying:  \"It's too small, and we don't ever give child size portion to adults!\"  This to me, was VERY RUDE! It's like: shoving more calories to people trying to watch their diet, and in some places would just walk away, and not pay for their meals.  For 3 pounds more, for YOU, and more food for us? If I have a very large customer, wanting to buy the child size flower, I wouldn't say to them: \"You have to buy the LARGE one, because you're large, and we only sell the little flowers to little children.\" They'd walk away and I'd be losing customers!  Hello!  The customers pay your salary, not YOUR Great-Great-Grand daddy!  When upon paying, I mentioned my grunt to our very nice waitress, repeating to her again, 'I just wanted to taste an Award Winning Ice Cream and we're full, and you said sure'  her only respond was:  \"Do you want me to go and ask?\"  I said: \"No, I don't want you to lose your job, just because of my ice cream'. Luckily, my husband & I both shared the ice cream gone, and if he would have ordered one for him, I would be forced to leave 3/4th of the ice cream, since I only eat 1 scoop at home, when I do. Yes, it was delicious, and NO, you don't shove ice cream to customers face (or table), without FIRST ASKING THEM, before you go & fix it.  You ASK, it's only polite!  On the window, there's a sign:  \"We're hiring\".  Hmmm, I feel a tension working here!",

So I can't really give a great review but I can say I like the atmosphere, hard good service, and when I was told it was a 5 minimum for card I bought a gelato which was more like normal ice cream but still good. I still wasnt 5 but the nice young lady let me off the hook which was really nice of her. I will be back again and the place was getting busy so stop on in and let the yelp community know how dinner is there, because dessert and a drink was good.",
