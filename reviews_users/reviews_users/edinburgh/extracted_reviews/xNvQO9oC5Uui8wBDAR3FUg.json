    "text": "Formerly known as Toast, the brunch game here is still as good as it gets! All the same delicious foods you enjoyed from Toast (like the full breakfasts) plus a few new goodies like smoked salmon on a bagel with pickles. Great coffee and smoothies. Always my favorite place for breakfast in Edinburgh. Don't miss it if you are in Marchmont in the morning.   I also tried their dinner and it was really yummy--a lamb burger with halloumi followed by a banoffee sundae really hit the spot. Since I live close by I will absolutely try it again!",

    "text": "Not sure about other meals but brunch here has definitely been an A+ experience. Especially in the midst of a wet and cold winter, sometimes all you need is a delicious hearty meal to begin your day.  Decided to seek refuge from a brief hailstorm here and ordered the two most appealing things on the menu: banana French toast and corn fritters with halloumi. Service was prompt and I was digging into my food like there was no tomorrow.  Fritters were warm and savoury with a great combo of fried halloumi, fritters, poached egg and beetroot salad on the side. French toast was sweet and tasty and the banana + creme fraiche marriage of flavours was good enough to kill for.   Overall, brightened my day up. An incredible adorable corner cafe that I would highly recommend to brunch lovers. Great price for the value and had a peak at dinner which enticed me to come back for more.  PS: was preciously called Toast",

    "text": "I have been meaning to review for a while now. Unfortunately like others I have focused on brunch, for which The Birchwood quite rightly has an excellent reputation. Open from 9am 7 days a week (shuts 5pm Sun and Mon), with lunch available from 11am, and dinner after 5pm. I have had the full breakfast, which is a \"clean\"* delight (*if you are looking for a greasy gutbuster, this not for you). Crombie sausages, Stornoway black pudding, free range eggs, all cooked perfectly.  I have also popped in for scrambled eggs on toast with salmon, which was also one of the very best versions of this simple but easy to get wrong dishes.  Excellent coffee from Mr Eion out of Stockbridge round things off nicely.  Cake selection is decent for afternoon tea.  Service is attentive and friendly, and there is free wifi. I would like to come back to try dinner service.  Overall, one of Edinburgh's best brunch venues.",

    "text": "First of all, a big thanks to the staff of the Wild Wood Cafe for letting a party of 20ish people take over 90% of your restaurant for a 60th birthday celebration.  When we got the invitation, we had never heard of Wild Wood, but the couple of reviews here helped us feel confident that we were up for a good night out - and we weren't disappointed.  It's a small venue with a small menu but the bright, fresh and comfortable atmosphere was matched with welcoming staff who handled our large group with ease.  The small menu had all my favourites - and I happily chose (we picked in advanced so that helped the staff serve our group) pigeon to start, followed by duck; my husband went for the scallops with black pudding (his fave combo) and the duck as well.  I would have started with the goat cheese and beet root tart but my hubby hates goat cheese and since I wanted to taste his scallops, I knew I had to order something I could barter with.  The food was fresh, nicely presented (without being super 'cheffy') and my options combined local ingredients with an asian spice palate.  The pigeon and red cabbage had a sweet, rich, star anise infused sauce (slight niggle that I bit into a giant piece of star anise that was hiding in the cabbage).  The pigeon was tender and enhanced by the wedges of roasted apples and fragrant braised cabbage.  I could have eaten a bowl of the cabbage on its own - I would love to be able to recreate this at home!  Actually, one of my tests for a good meal is whether I want to try and make it myself and the Wild Wood really delivered on this.  I've recently started making duck breast according to a meal we had in Provenance.  I am now moving on and will try to recreate the Wild Wood version.  The duck was simply cooked and sliced, and accompanied by another asian inspired sauce.  But, unlike the braised cabbage, this was lighter and fresher with hints of ginger and Chinese 5-spice.  The duck sat on top of a sweet potato rosti, again fab - and surprisingly crisp and fresh - not overcooked and mushy.    In fact it had more of the texture of grated carrot.  A lightly cooked warm 'salad' of rocket and Pak Choi rounded out the plate - and gave me veg cooking envy.    There was a small selection of desserts - lacking a chocolate option for me - but luckily we had a birthday cake to satisfy our sweet tooth.   I am now off to hunt ingredients to try and work out how to recreate their beautifully spiced sauces and vegetables but I have the feeling I may just head back to Wild Wood and let them do the work for me.  At a 3 course set price of around 23 - I'd be foolish not to.",
