    "text": "I finally visited Leaf and Bean the other day and to be honest, I can't see myself returning.  We were unenthusiastically greeted by two staff who watched and listened as we discussed the lack of breakfast items and ended up ordering scones instead. It wasn't until we sat down that we found food menus with, surprisingly, breakfast.  I ended up being glad that we hadn't ordered anything as I heard the familiar beep of a microwave and the smell of poor quality bacon turned my stomach.  On the plus side our coffees were very nice and prices reasonable.  Morningside and Bruntsfield are full of great cafes. If you're looking for somewhere not fancy to bring your toddler, Leaf and Bean will suit. But if you're child free, I'd recommend elsewhere.",
