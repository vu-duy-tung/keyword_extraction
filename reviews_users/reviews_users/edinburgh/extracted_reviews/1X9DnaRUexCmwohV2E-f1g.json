    "text": "Pizza Express on North bridge, while being part of a chain of such establishments, professes to be a non-franchised eatery. To the casual customer, this would seem True. Leaning heavily on a perceived informality countered by stylish and clean-cut setting for caricature, it runs the gauntlet between a high-class restaurant and pizza shop. While a little on the pricey side for a cheap meal out, it does cater for the penniless amongst us, if you pick and choose carefully from the menu, including a couple of nice pasta dishes. A short but interesting wine list and a bright and cheery atmosphere rounds off a nice night out.",

    "text": "As a chain, Pizza Express can usually be relied upon to provide a consistent quality of slightly above average pizza at a reasonable price.   I've been to this particular branch twice & won't be going back. The service the first time was mediocre & the second time was appalling.   Having dropped my pizza and been seen picking it up, they tried to serve it to me, then eventually offered to put my partner's under a heat lamp while mine was made fresh.   Staff were surly and slow, despite the place being quiet.   All in all, a real let down to what is otherwise a reliable, if not special, chain of restaurants.   If you fancy a Pizza Express, my advice would be to head to the one in Stockbridge: nicer building, nicer atmosphere & much better service.",

    "text": "We're not huge fans of Pizza Express, but with the current Tesco Clubcard Boost deal (where you can exchange Tesco Clubcard points for restaurant vouchers) we decided to pay them a visit.  It appears that during the Festival they're running a reduced menu (kind of a pre-theatre deal) which makes sense as they were pretty busy, even at 3pm. It was a little disappointing, but they still had most of the classic dishes on there and it did say you could ask for items from the normal menu.  Overall, the food was fairly average and the general service didn't seem great - we watched a couple of tables have to get up and ask for the bill as they were being ignored. The saving grace was our amazing waitress who not only gave us great service throughout, but also went out of her way to make sure we got the most out of our vouchers by offering us a dessert to takeaway (and even adding a mini brownie to the slice of chocolate fudge brownie when she spotted we still had a couple of pounds of voucher left).   As with most chain restaurants, Pizza Express is nothing spectacular but it is a solid pick for reasonably priced food. Just don't expect a table after 6pm during the festival!",

    "text": "Ahhh Pizza Express, you purveyor of tasty pizzas you, part of me is glad you exist for I know of your qualities, another wishes you didn't so local business would prosper.  Regardless, we needed some food and after a couple of unsuccessful attempts (YOU try finding some where to eat during the Fringe Festival!) we 'gave up' and headed to Pizza Express.  It was a little later in the evening, but they confirmed they were still serving food for another hour or so, and we were soon seated and our order was placed.  And then we waited.  This review will now focus on the amount of time we waited as the food was - as it usually is - tasty fare.  But we waited, and waited, and waited, and waited. We asked the waiter to check and he said the 'food was coming' and we waited some more. We eyed up the food that was brought out for the guy sitting next to us and debated mugging him for it but, because we are nice people we didn't do that, we just waited some more.  Did I mention there was a bit of a wait? Like an hour? Should we have complained and left? Perhaps. But it was late and the fear was the only other options would be a bag of chips or a McDs, so we stayed (plus they were serving us alcohol).  Anyway, we waited for a while (did I mention that? I should really mention that, that we waited for QUITE A LONG TIME!) our food arrived and it was good. I do like the Padana (that's goats cheese and caramelised red onion to you), and I've never had a bad food experience in a Pizza Express before but as there was a bit of a wait, for no good reason that we could see - remember, they did say they were still serving, and it wasn't massively busy, plenty of empty tables - I left confused.  Happy that I'd had beer and a tasty pizza. Grumpy because there wasn't really much of an apology for the wait.  I will eat in Pizza Express again no doubt, I just hope that I leave Happy/Happy next time, not Happy/Grumpy (although, to be fair, there was a little bit \"Tipsy\" in there too).",

It's just so lovely and exactly what I have been missing at nearly every other restaurant in the UK.  People often ask me what I miss about home (US) and the only thing I say without hesitation is, \"the entree salad.\"  Why is it so rare here to find a salad that is not only big enough to constitute an entire meal, but is also GOOD?  Well here at Pizza Express, of all places, I have finally found it.  This was my first time ever in a Pizza Express.  There's apparently one in George Square, but I've been spending all my culinary energy in that part of town at Pintos...not any more I won't!  Three stars for the ho-hum service.  Nothing remarkably bad about the service, but certainly nothing stand-out amazing.  So four stars it is for Pizza Express - imagine my surprise!",

    "text": "I am a massive fan of Pizza Express. I adore their pizzas and when they have deals on I'm there in a flash. Not a fan of the name, in Ireland the chain uses the name 'Milanos' which I think suits the food a bit more (and is a lot less like Pizza Hut).  Went here with my friends on a Saturday evening at around 6:30pm and were given a table straight away (no booking). We had a coupon code for 3 courses 13 which was pretty awesome, there was a slight restriction on what we could order but it didn't bother me. I had the dough balls, a margarita and a (generous) slice of cheesecake. All lovely. Like I said, I love their pizzas, their sauce is one of the best.   The staff were very attentive. Our waitress had a strong accent that I had some trouble with but i'd put that down to the noise. Also, there was a slight delay with starters but the place was just getting busy. I was pretty happy with the place and all set to add it to my list of regulars...  However, I'm also a fan of clean bathrooms... I was pretty shocked when I saw the loo in this particular establishment. It wasn't late in the evening but 2 of the stalls were missing toilet paper, apart from what had been clearly thrown about on the ground. Not only that, but the precarious walk down the metal 'factory' steps had me worried (True I'm not the best in my high heels though!) and the floor at the bottom of the steps was manky.  It's such a pity but as much as I like the food and the service the bathrooms made feel all icky so I came away from the place with a negative view. I much prefer the branch on George IV bridge.",

Oh yeah, you should also tell them when you have to leave, just so the waiter is aware of your time constraints.  The staff is friendly and attending.  -1 for making me wait 20 minutes for the food. Overall, I had a great experience here. Just a great place to enjoy some good Italian food and relax.",

I had a voucher where myself and a friend could get two courses and a glass of wine for a 10, so I didn't take much convincing to pop in here for what I thought would be a nice little evening.   When we walked in, we were left standing around until we had to approach a waiter to ask if we could be seated, to which we received a rude response of \"in a minute!\", even though there were plenty of tables available. When we were finally seated with menus, we sat for 15 without service, and weren't even asked if we would like a drink. After 20 minutes of desperately trying to make eye contact with the waiters and waitresses, who paid us no attention at all, we got up and left.  I found the service here to be appalling and I was amazed at the lack of customer service from the staff and what appeared to be the manageress, who gave a half hearted apology when she finally noticed we were leaving the restaurant. Definitely not the treatment I would expect from such an established restaurant chain.",

Salads that are actually filling and fresh.   Good value but less so these days - a Veneziana used to be about 5.50, it's now over 6 and the most expensive pizzas cost nearly 10.   You can usually see the chefs getting everything prepared and cooked.   Simple decor and clean, airy ambience.   This particular branch is hotly located on North Bridge and as a result gets very busy during the festival. However, it does have quite a few covers so can usually fit in a table for 2 quite swiftly.

The restaurant itself is never overly busy (can be when they have offers on though) the atmosphere is very nice too with little spotlights highlighting each table induvidualy.

The only thing I do not like is the omission of a good fish dish. Please Pizza Express, you cater for vegetarian very well, and meat eaters, but can you pause and think for us fish eaters and I may come even more often. My favourite dish is the spinach canelloni but as I do not eat pizzas there is not a great deal of choice. A nice clam pasta would go down well! My favourite dessert is the coffee and figs in marsala wine and cream with a dash of Irish baileys in the coffee. I do like the way they give you lots of extra parmesan. The wine is very expensive however, I cannot grumble as we usually do not pay anything for the food. Well done staff. You are very friendly, polite and efficient.",
