    "text": "It took me nearly a year to actually order food is actually made here, even though i'm in on a fairly regular basis. So why is it getting five stars? Because in sleepy little Stockbridge, this is one of the only places that stays open past 11pm AND they have an entire case of Ben & Jerry's ice cream. I pull a lot of very late nights with work, and sometimes, a gal just needs Half Baked Ben & Jerry's to see her past the midnight mark.  I know what you're thinking: ice cream and late hours does not a five star make, but the folks who work here make a point of saying hello to regulars. Every time i'm in, they ask how I am, how work is. It's a little exchange but you'd be surprised how often it gets overlooked. There's something to be said about walking into a place and having someone light up and say hello - it goes a long way towards making this place the neighbourhood hub that it is.  Bonus points: after an event this past week, I had fish and chips here. Chip = excellent. Fish = ok. Not gangbusters amazing but the HUGE meal was only 6, I bought it at 11:45pm on a weekday and it kept me upright long enough to put away all my event supplies when I got home.  I'm pretty happy this place exists.",

    "text": "So I've only been living in Stockbridge a few months now, but I agree with the opinion that this is a Stockbridge institution.   I come here every 2-3 weeks and each time I have ordered the fish and chips. I've never been disappointed with my order.   I usually ask for my food to be a bit more well done when being cooked as it makes the batter more crispy. The chips are delicious too, on each occasion my chips have come out buttery, crunchy and piping hot.   Definitely recommended to anyone wanting delicious fish and chips, the staff are lovely and the food is great!  Also, check the opening times. When I check online is seems to be open only at night, but I have been there for lunch a few times.",

    "text": "Franco's is a great takeaway conveniently on the way back from town, coming towards Marchmont. It is cheap, does great greasy food and the guys there are good fun. It is a dirty little place, with the food often left under the heat lamp for ages but somehow still tastes good. The sausage supper is good, and you get two sausages, as opposed to only one in most other chippies. The haggis, fish and burgers are also pretty average. Everything, as you'd want with a Scottish chippy has had the hell battered out of it, but when you come back late at night you don't mind.  As well as fish and chips they do loads of different pizzas and kebabs. The kebabs are not great, but the pizzas aren't bad. If you can't decide between the two, go for the awesome doner calzone, which is so so good when you have it, but you will pay the price the next day as it plays havoc on your stomach.  Open later than the other takeaways around, Franco's targets the drunkards, and with really cheap prices and good greasy food it succeeds. You could do much worse",

    "text": "Consistently the best chip shop I have visited in the New Town and I am quite fussy about my fish and chips.  I have had fish suppers, sausage suppers all the usual fare and the chips are cooked to perfection, the fish is always crispy outside but beautifully cooked inside (never been greasy) and everything else I've had tasted great. The produce doesn't sit under the lamp long, often I've had to wait 5-10 mins but it's always been worth it.  Also, I've had pizza there several times and it is really good and reasonably priced, especially if you get a larger size for an extra few pounds. Proper Italian style oven baked efforts, super tasty.  There is a chip shop much nearer my house, but I much prefer making the effort to go to Franco's.",

    "text": "Franco's Chip Shop serves great food and the owners are as pleasant as you'll meet in an Edinburgh chippy.  The first time my friend and I went we had a battered sausage and fish supper respectively.  Whilst we waited for them to be fried to order Franco and his colleague were forced to ask a drunk women to leave.  For about five minutes she was a mere nuisance but when she claimed 'there's somethin' wrong with your batter' Franco was tipped over the edge.   Unfortunately she was right.  My friend and I both conceded that the batter, although crisp on the outside, was too chewy and almost like pastry.  The chips, however, were excellent and the quality of the sausage and fish was also outstanding. Despite the disappointing batter, Franco's Chip Shop offers great service and food to those who just can't be bothered cooking and those on a ravenous rampage from a night out.",

I must disagree however, that chippy food that's been under the lamp isn't that great.  When it comes to a king rib or chicken, the more shrivelled up and dried out the better in my book. If it gets to the lukewarm, e-coli cultivating stage though, I'd rather one straight out the frying pan.",

    "text": "A friend of mine loved Franco's so much that a group of us decided that instead of getting him a birthday present we would get him 'store credit' for fish and chips here. Whilst he also wept with happiness, I've forever suffered the guilt of watching his waistline expand...  Franco's is a brilliant Fish and Chip shop, the kind of place that they make you wait for 5 or 10 minutes when you arrive because they're just cooking up a new batch. This means you never suffer the curse of eating a piece of fish that has been sitting under the heat lamp all morning. The fish is always fresh, crispy and delicious and better still you get two pieces in a supper. Two! I'm still yet to find a chippy this good anywhere in London!",

    "text": "Franco's seemed to be the last stop of our drunken retreat back to our student halls at Sciennes while I was in first year, and it soon became recognised as the source for a \"guaranteed stomach hangover\".   My main gripe with Franco's is the lack of freshness.  I've had too many suppers that have been sitting out under the lamp for most likely hours.  I'm a fan of my puddings, and on the few occasions I've had a black or white pudding supper, they have been extremely dry and tasteless. The batter here is also far too chewy.  What's worse, after a certain time, they refuse to cook you anything fresh and will only offer you what they have already prepared. The chips are OK, yet have a tendency to be too soggy and certainly nothing on the nearby competition.   The prices are not too bad, however given the quality of what you are paying for, you're much better off forking out a bit more and going to one of the other nearby chippies (Newington Traditional Fish Bar on the next street for one).   The one saving grace is the large portion size of the fish supper, giving an excellent fish to chip ratio. Aside from that however, probably one to avoid unless the purse strings are tight.",

They are twinned with the italian restaurant next door, so you know you are getting good quality pizzas. If you order a pasta meal, they cook it in the restaurant and bring it through for you to takeaway - so you really are getting restaurant quality food. The family working there have been there for the 20 odd years i've been going (ever since i started at school!) and are always friendly and funny company. The do a delivery option which is ideal when you have a few friends round and don't want to leave the house!",
