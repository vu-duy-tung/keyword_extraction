    "text": "The hubby and I came here for dinner on a Saturday night while we're visiting Edinburgh, Scotland. This place was kind of hidden in a small ally on the royal mile. We ran into it quite by accident while we were walking around the Royal mile. It was so busy on friday night we couldn't get a table, so we made a reservation for Saturday night to come back. We were so glad we came back. The place had a very lively energy with all kinds of people eating and drinking here. I had the steak and fries and the hubby had chicken. The dishes seem simple enough, but it was executed perfectly. My steak was cooked perfectly at midum rare, and had tons of flavor, even the fries were done really well. The thick cut fries were crispy on the outside and fluffy and flavorful on the inside. The grilled chicken was equally delicious with tender and juicy meat complimented by delicious veggies. I asked the waiter to recommend a cocktail with whisky and he recommended 'the running man', since I liked fruity cocktails. It was a spot on recommendation.   Overall, it was such a great dining experience, we will definitely come back when visit Edinburgh again.",

And what a good idea that was! Saturday evening, no reservation and yet, the super friendly staff managed to seat us upstairs. The food was delicious but the cocktail selection was a delight! Grilled haloumi cheese & watermelon starter was excellent and so was the vegetable carpaccio. Light, yet super tasty - perfect introduction to our mains. Both, the pork fillet and the mallet were cooked to perfection, beautifully plated and delicious. However, the cocktails were the stars of our evening. We had several and could not agree on a favorite one, so I guess we need to come back :) The upstairs eating area is much calmer than the bar and lets you have a conversation. Loved it!",

They seated us right away for dinner even without reservations. We got there at 6pm on a Tuesday night. Maybe we were just lucky.  Very friendly and warm staff. Food was awesome. Probably one of our best meals thus far in the UK. I had the delcious perfectly seasoned succulent pork belly. Fat never tasted so good.   My friend had the lamb dish. Perfectly prepared and paired with fresh tomatoes and potatoes.  Whiskey selection is wide and far (local to the States to Japan). Pages and pages of it. Loved it.   Would definitely recommend this to friends near and far. Just make reservations ahead.",

The atmosphere was a bit chic, low lighting etc which was enjoyable.  After a few pints we were on our way back home.

    "text": "There is a reason Devil's Advocate has such good Yelp reviews. This place is cute, cool, kind of hidden and has a really nice ambiance and menu. The booths in little hidden alcoves makes having intimate conversation with friends much easier and the darker mood lighting is a nice touch.   I came here with some friends for a girls night with food and drinks. The drink menu is pretty eclectic and has some really interesting options. The server had some good off-menu suggestions and everything we had was very good. One thing we did notice though is that the drink/price ratio is pretty bad. All our drinks came in tiny, fancy cocktail glasses of various forms. While adorable, this makes for about three sips before your drink is gone and you are looking around for another. The food was similarly good and eclectic, but small portions that were hard to share and didnt go far.   Aside from the cost ratio, the only other real downside I see to DA is that service wasnt always the fastest. We waited for drinks a lot via table service, which seemed silly when we were three steps from the bar. The food came out pretty quickly, but it you wanted to get your server's attention for anything they were difficult to track down. Same deal with getting and paying the bill.   Overall a nice place, great drinks, food and ambiance. Will definitely return, just dont be in a rush and be prepared to lay down some cash.",

Small but tasty appetizers. Especially liked the cod main dish. The chicken tagliatelle and roasted garlic gnocchi were good not great. Definitely worth a visit.",

Located off of Advocate's Close down the Royal Mile, we stumbled upon this place while walking to new town. They bar area is large with plenty of room to stand either at the bar while waiting or at a smaller high top. Very cool selection of house cocktails and the bartenders seemed to be able to whip different things up off the top of their heads as well!!   We were seated on the ground floor in a somewhat private booth. 3 of us split a charcuterie board of excellent selections of meats and cheeses and oil. I got the pan roasted pork chop with chorizo and sweet potato puree and it was by far one of the best meals I've had in months. Everything on their menu looked and smelled incredible from what we saw. I will 100% be returning to this place when we return!!",

We called that night and they only had two tables left for dinner service Saturday.  We were sat at one of the three tables downstairs by the restroom--we didn't mind, as it wasn't noisy or smelly, and our server was attentive the entire night.  We ordered two cocktails, both of which were good. For starters, we went with the soup of the day (cauliflower and onion), the terrine and cheese board, and the sauteed spinach and mushrooms with garlic puree. Everything was absolutely delicious. Scraped the soup bowl clean with the sourdough bread.  For mains, my partner got the lamb rump, and I got the pork chop with pancetta, cabbage, sweet potato puree and roast apple. We also got a side of parmesan truffle chips. Again, so good. My partner finished his whole plate and some of mine. I was able to box up leftovers.   It was fairly pricey meal but it was really satisfying and tasty. Definitely recommend giving this place a go.",

I had just arrived in Edinburgh and was hungry. After chatting with my Airbnb host, she agreed that she'd heard good things about The Devil's Advocate (I had already bookmarked it on Yelp). My accommodation was right down the street. It's in the middle of Advocate Close, so you either need to walk up or down a bunch of steps, dependent on which direction you're coming from.  I walked down and asked about seating for one. The bartender suggested the bar, which suited me just fine. I was quickly given a porter (taste before full pour) and ordered the burger.  Here's a testament to how good it was: I didn't realize it had peppers on it. I ate them anyway even though I despise peppers in most instances. Because they complemented the flavoring so well. The whole thing was just so good. I think my picture of it tells it all.  One meh point: It was an expensive burger. But you're paying for top quality.  I wholeheartedly recommend this place and am accepting burger donations.",

It's also really dim inside, but I suppose that enhances the vibe. They are well known for their drinks, so definitely order one (or two) at the bar.   I ordered the chicken pasta and it was just divine. The truffle oil was the best part of it.   For dessert, I got a whiskey sour sorbet with poached pear. Hands down the best sorbet I've ever had. I also love how it was artfully garnished with white chocolate pieces and raspberries.   Despite my meal costing me a pretty penny, I would absolutely return. The flavorful dishes make it well worth it!",

Food is quite good, but doesn't quite manage to transcend to greatness.  Service is generally good if somewhat unfocused - five different servers over the course of our meal - so no bond of hospitality with your server happening here, and they're very busy, so despite what you'll charitably credit as their best efforts, don't expect a lot of love.    Overall a positive experience, but it seems like the kind of place where your table assignment is partly based on simple availability, but you can't help but feel like tables are awarded based on how beautiful you are. Apparently we should be happy that we got a table and accept that we're just not as beautiful as those people who didn't have a reservation but got seated on the patio regardless - if this kind of thing makes you crazy, this is not your place.  If you're looking to be seen in a happening restaurant then you'll love it.",

It has great 'tucked away to be found only by the locals' ambience and great beer (I recommend the Dia des los murtes IPA), but the food isn't 5-star and staff are quite capable of making mistakes. The upstairs eating area, although nice, means that staff spend a lot of time not seeing that you need them - particularly given that we gave me the wrong beer originally and I spent several minutes waiting to get it replaced (which they did with no fuss).  Probably the main thing that dragged my experience down though, was the hard sell I got from the guy giving me the bill, given both the less-than-fantastic service I'd received and the fact he'd not himself served me at any point before that exchange! Left with a 2-star taste in my mouth instead of a 3-star.  I'd probably grab a beer here with a couple of friends, and might edit this back up to a 3-star based on that experience, but I don't see myself eating here again when there's at least four better restaurants up the top of Advocate's Close and straight down George IV Bridge a couple minutes, let alone every other direction.",

I was there recently for a pre-dinner drink with my husband. The place is not very big - it has a few seats downstairs and a mezzanine area reserved for diners. But it has a cosy atmosphere, great for candle lit chats.   If you want whisky, this is a great place for it as they have over 200 whiskies to choose from. However, we ordered a glass of pinot noir and a gin & tonic (table service). The drinks arrived and I requested a new glass as it looked dirty. They were very apologetic about it and actually deducted the wine from the bill, which was unnecessary but I accepted that.  I would love to try out the food as well so maybe next time it will dinner and drinks!",

This was maybe the best meal that we had in Scotland with an interesting menu.    The drinks are creative and tasty.  My friend wanted to mix up the fun brand in one of her cocktails for our second round, and they kindly obliged her request, and then returned to check that it was still okay.   I LOVED my sweet potato chili (though my friend found it slightly too spicy) and my specialty salad.  All the ingredients were fresh and created in the perfect flavor combinations.  So delicious!

    "text": "A tiny haunt tucked into a nondescript alleyway that serves a mean old fashioned? Hell, they had me at the entire shelf of Japanese whisky, the rest was just icing on the cake.  After a colourful (read: boozy) start to our evening, myself and visiting Edmonton CM turned to the ol' Yelp mobile to continue our shenanigans with a few cocktails. Even with a map in front of us, it took three walk bys before we spotted the wee little alley that leads to this wee little cocktail bar. The stairs down (or up, depending on your vantage point) are perhaps the city's best sobriety test. I'm sure the door gents just watch and only allow those who can make it down without looking like they'll pitch to their certain death at any moment. Because of this, I very vocally pointed out the difficulty level of high heels on uneven steps as we teetered down in the rain.  With a quick shake of the umbrella, we stepped into a beautiful gem of a bar. I can't speak for the food, or the seating in general. To be honest - we saw the bar, and happily stayed put for a few rounds, but for that, I can happily speak to the quality of the libations.  It's a long standing tradition that I judge a bar by the oomph of their old fashioned. The Devils Advocate did not disappoint - they served up a beautifully balanced drink, made with care but without the 15 minute show you can get at other \"we do good cocktail\" joints. It was well made, without the pomp and much appreciated by our little party. But where this spot truly won my heart, was with a brief glance up to an entire shelf dedicated to Japanese spirits. A nice Yamazaki or Nikka is my newest whisky obsession and hailing from Vancouver, where you're lucky to see one or two bottles on the go, the sheer promise of a 5+ range? This lady is a happy camper.  Service was lovely, quick and no bs. The folks milling about the bar are a fun mix of eclectic professionals and the vibe is one that makes you want to pull up a chair and put back a few. I didn't get a chance to ask about their wifi, but seeing as though they open at 9am, I daresay with a good signal, this will fast become a regular \"office\" soon enough.  Either way, come cocktail hour, I will definitely be back. Afterall, I only tried two whiskies while I was there - more research is definitely needed. Worth getting lost for, and as always, mind the stairs.",

We went up to the bar to order, but were quickly whisked to a table instead. This was fine, except that no one told the wait staff that there was a new table waiting to be served and we sat there for about 10 minutes until we were able to flag someone down.  Drinks order placed, drinks received, all in order.    Until our drinks were finished.  We sat with empty glasses for long enough that \"let's have one more\" turned into \"let's just go\"  When we were finally able to get the bill, we quickly handed over our money, the bill whisked away, and no change given.   I get that tipping for table service is becoming more of a done thing, especially when getting special drinks like cocktails.  But certainly not for beers, and not when I tried to order at the bar anyway.    With the waitress well and truly disappeared, we had to go to the bar where we were faced with confusion about where the waitress had gone and hadn't we paid \"AGES ago\" anyway?  Yes we had, we've been waiting for change.   It all left us with a bad taste in our mouths.   I would go back, but for goodness sake just relax and let people order at the bar and we'll be alright.",

    "text": "A real hidden gem - who knew it was possible to get so lost only a stone's throw from the Castle?!   This bar is tucked away on Advocate's Close up some winding steps that made me start thinking my colleagues had given me the wrong address. It has atmosphere by the bucketload, that builds from when you're wandering up the historic old Close, to when you're standing at the beautiful high-ceilinged bar with its rough stone walls that makes you feel like it's been carved into the hillside.  The clipboardful of drinks menus is a treat - several pages of whiskies that I must go back for, and cocktails that intrigue. Our bearded barman took real care over making these, and was a joy to watch and chat to.  My first cocktail was gin-based and enjoyable but it was the second that blew me away - if you're a whisky fan (and don't mind a girly glass) get The Convent. I always try to pick something with a new ingredient for me, and this had creme d'violet, malic acid solution, peat and heather, which all sounded suitably exotic! Oh and Highland Park 12. It was deliciously strong, and felt extra special after they told me it was the last one of the night because they'd run out of the violet stuff. Win!  Front of house staff are also on the ball - most of the tables were busy when we arrived but the lady who first welcomed us kept us in mind when one of these cleared, and explained we could sit until the reservation arrived. So we took a seat up on the mezzanine, at which point the guys promptly got food envy and ordered a couple of ham and cheese platters with bread and oil. Yum.  You probably need to book ahead for food, but it's a new fave to pop in for post-work drinks. Make sure you're not in a rush though, as you'll need time to pull yourself together and choose a drink after admiring the candlelit bar itself... :)",

Pork chops and Beef Tails were cooked perfectly and presented elegantly. Moist meat and appropriate volume of sauce for flavoring. Many restaurants drown their meal is sauce to cover underlying flaws, no need here as the meat is well selected and prepared.  Decent selection and variety of deserts. The lemon desert provided a light zest on the palate with a creamy texture.  THE BAD: Nothing of mention.  THE UGLY: Nothing of mention.  OVERALL IMPRESSION: If you are in search of a centrally located, appropriately priced restaurant with perfectly prepared dishes and good atmosphere then look no further. I would highly recommend attending. They have a sister restaurant in the \"new town\" of Edinburgh called El Cartel which is also fantastic (see review).",

Since then I've been keen to head back here and try out the food.   I had the pea and leek arancini, and my date had the butternut squash salad. I though the salad was pretty tasty, even if I'm not the hugest fan of cold salads when I'm super hungry. The arancini was absolutely scrumptious! A lovely crispy outside, with soft gooey risotto in the middle. Heaven. And definitely what I needed for my second (!!) dinner after yoga with a certain former CM.  My only down point for this place is the very limited desert menu. In fairness, DA is a Gastrobar thing and not an actual restaurant. The kitchen space is probably pretty limited for making a load of deserts.  All in all I really like this bar. I definitely want to try out more of their food, and more of what's behind the bar.",

Owned by the same chaps as Bon Vivant on Thistle Street. I didn't have the food here nor did we get the chance to sit at a table (you'll have to book) so we stood at the bar which is what my review is based on. The lighting is low and this place is excellent for a date night. Prices are Edinburgh average - not cheap but not ridiculously expensive either (cocktail ~8). A place I will be taking newbies to the city to.  When you turn off the Royal mile onto Advocate close just keep going and it's on your left hand side (there was a point when I thought we weren't on the right close!).",

    "text": "\"We should check out that new place down Advocate's Close!\" we said. Little did we know that it was a new regular haunt in the making. Great food and a massive list of whisky (and whiskey) coupled with no-BS serving! Shame about the beer selection, though.  Aside from the odd G&T and White Russian, I'm no big fan of cocktails. When I'm at home, I tend to prefer a straight up single malt if I'm not having beer or wine. When I'm out, I find spirits are almost always way too expensive. So! When I'm out, it tends to be wine with the food or beer at the bar. And the beer selection is a bit on the sad side when compared to the massive list of whisky and the general quality of everything else at Devil's Advocate.  So, that's the \"bad\" stuff out of the way (not so bad, really, just a matter of choice.) Let's move on to the good stuff!  I fairly regularly get visitors from out of the country, and when I do, I have a small selection of places I tend to recommend for food. Devil's Advocate has now joined First Coast (great and diverse food, decent prices), World's End (reasonable, proto-scottish pub-grub), Grain Store and Blackfriar's (Both high end, for when my parents visit and insist on paying).  I almost always order at least the black haggis bonbons to start with as they are a great and easily shareable haggis/ black pudding treat for people who are curious about haggis but not quite comfortable getting the full haggis, neeps and tatties experience. I really should start considering other options for myself, as the other starters look delicious!  Their burgers, though not the BEST I've ever had, are fabulous! Chunky and full of flavour and come with similarly chunky chips. You might need a fork, not necessarily for eating the burger (though it is one of those \"take the top off to eat it\" jobs) but for protecting your chips from the thieving fingers of your cohorts. You have been warned.  They change up their menu every now and then, and usually have a Fish of the Day, which is always worth considering. Their vegetarian options are limited but just as worthy of consideration as all the other meals. Last time I went, both my partners in crime opted for the butternut squash risotto after considering that and the oxtail, and it was great! For the record, I've tried their oxtail, and it's QUITE good.  It's been a while since I've had their desserts, I'll make a note to try them next time I go.  The service isn't full of unnecessary pleasantries, nor are they overly polite, but they're (usually) friendly and always effective and have always treated me and mine well. They know what they're doing and they do it well. That isn't to say they're terse or in any way unhelpful, just that I never felt like they were imposing a manufactured \"friendly\" atmosphere on us, as can happen in a lot of places.  All in all, a great place to go for food and cocktails, just not one I would stay in afterward to drink. And that's fine. They can't be everything to everyone.",

It looked like fun, but I was solo and I didn't feel like fighting my way to the bar (plus the fact I was starving!)) I went back a couple days later for lunch with my team that was in town and we were all blown away. The attention to detail and the food is awesome. On a warmer day, you can sit outside... The whole experience is great. Highly recommend. Make a reservation!!",

The bartender was really helpful, the waitress was so friendly 2. The ambiance is rocking!   They really kept an authentic feel to this place.   They have everything covered from the quieter table, bar, louder room and outdoor patios.  All are great.  And the walkway you take to get there is so amazing 3.  The food was top notch, they really worked hard to create a great menu and I saw our menu was different than what I saw on yelp prior, so they seem to change it seasonally.    We got a shared appetizer and I got the Venison, it was cooked perfect.  My brother got the pork chop, again cooked perfect!    Top stars!!",

When we came in it was already packed with people but the door man let us in for a beverage not the restaurant. The bar area was full with people waiting for the restaurant. Only a short walk from the Royal Mile. If you're debating which bar to visit, I would add this to your list!",

    "text": "Awesome venue, novel and concise gastropub menu including interesting cocktails and craft beer, stellar service, sizeable food portions. It's upscale enough to make for a romantic date night.  The Devil's Advocate is a modern looking buildout in a historic part of Edinburgh. Inside the venue, they've done an excellent job incorporating the original, now exposed, stonework with modern decors like Edison lights and exposed ceilings. There is an upper loft of table seating along with an open floor space near the bar. We sat up in the loft for dinner service. Interior lighting was very dim, which gives it an old tavern-like ambiance.  The menu here is rotating and concise with limited options, which is a good thing. I went for some local beer on draft that tasted fresh and was served in a large mug to keep the tavern feel going. Wife went with a signature cocktail, which tasted great and was served in a chilled, stainless shaker. Wife ordered the whole grilled sea bream, which I tried and it was phenomenal. Bone-in, rock salted, crispy skin. Wow! I ordered the braised lamb shank, which needed some salt but was otherwise braised to perfection served with a unique carb base of al dente chickpeas. Service was phenomenal throughout the evening.    Overall, this was one of our favorite dining experiences in the UK.",

Tried to go one night without a reservation, and couldn't get in, so we made a reservation the next night (Hint: Make reservations at night) I heard about the burgers being great, but they must be a daytime item, as there were no burgers on the menu when we went. All of our food was great however, even if i didn't get a burger. Whiskey lovers will enjoy the place, as many many selections. We had grown fond of Ciders here in the UK, and their only cider options were in a can. That's the only down side. Give it a try, and you'll enjoy the meal!",

The scotch, bourbon, and whiskey selection is outstanding, and it allowed me to savor the 21-year old Glennfiddich Gran Reserve.  I love a good single-malt scotch, and always have Glenfiddich at home - but don't often get the chance to enjoy the 21 year old variant!  The mixed drink menu is also great; I suggest the Black Dog, and the Rest on Your Laurels. Well done!  The food here is supposed to be excellent as well, but we ended up leaving before our table was open.  If you do stay to eat, there are good outdoor areas beside the close, as well as private booths snd an upstairs area.  Enjoy!",

Built into the steep side of one of Edinburgh \"closes\" - narrow slip roads that wend their way through the streets, carrying you from one gothic level to another - the mood here is trendy medieval, if there is such a thing. The bar space is massive and the main dining area is upstairs. When we popped in, we didn't have a reservation, but they told us that we could eat if they could have the table back in an hour. We had a ghost tour in 90 minutes, so this was more than ideal! Despite the time constraints, we didn't feel rushed. The menu is solidly British. Highly recommend any of the fish dishes. The beer selection is lovely as well. Overall, an awesome experience in a very cool setting. Don't miss this place when you're in Edinburgh!",

    "text": "Quite possibly the most hipster place I visited while abroad. We arrived for a late lunch around 2:30 on a Saturday. There was no one to greet us and it seemed pretty chaotic. Bartenders trying to make drinks, food runners racing up and down the stairs, and no host stand in sight. We finally waved down a worker, told him our party size, and he said it would be a 20 minute wait... didn't take our names or anything so we just stood at the bar and ordered drinks. The drink menu is vast and there are a number of creative cocktails available. Our wait ended up being closer to 45 minutes, but whatever.   The upstairs area is pretty small, so I wasn't surprised why we waited to so long to be seated. The service was pretty nonchalant-- no sense of urgency, greeting, or description of the menu. Luckily, we still had our drinks that we ordered from the bar and were able to place our food order right away. Our food took awhile to come out. However, the falafel/lentil appetizer was very unique and tasty. The fish and chips were okay, not the best I had while traveling. My husband's burger was very dry and definitely needed some sauce or cheese to moisten it up. It did have a \"tomato salsa\" on it that resembled neither tomato nor salsa, but more of a tomato paste. It was weird in a bad way. He was pretty disappointed with how terrible the burger was, considering so many other reviewers raved about the burgers here.   Overall, we had an A-OK time. Would I come back? Maybe for a cocktail. Was it the best hipster place I experience while abroad? No.",

The peas, onions and white sauce adorning the dish were fantastic! One of the best dishes we had in Scotland. Only negatives were that the restaurant was VERY loud and we had trouble hearing each other. Also, there's a dumbbell that brings up food from the kitchens to the second floor, and our waiter left halfway through taking our orders to take a dish to another table. I'd highly recommend if you like great food and drinks, and don't mind a loud atmosphere and sightly inattentive staff.",

    "text": "I'd heard about this place, both on here and on the TWITTAH grapevine. Given I was wandering aimlessly from place to place the other night, I figured this would be a test of my navigational skills.  I never realise where the stairs at the bottom of Advocate's close came on until I walked down them after I left here, but I'm getting ahead of myself now, I suppose. Back to the beginning!  So from the outside, it looks nice and new and stylish and clean, and a big glass door entrance. When you go in, it's very modern and funky, all exposed brick and chrome and black steel... indeed, the first thought I had was that I'd walked into the nightclub from the original Terminator movie, which would have been weird and required time travel too.  There was a huge range of spirits behind the bar, and the staff seemed to be spot on with their recommendations to people; I settled for a bourbon, lemonade, and lime - and it came in at a reasonable 4. For a modern-ish new bar, that's not bad, especially in city centre Edinburgh prices.  It was exceedingly busy when I was in, about 10pm on a Friday evening, and a lot of people did seem to want to be there to be seen to be there, if you know what I mean. Wandering in off the street on my own, I did feel a little out of place, and the lack of hidey holes or wall based drinking places stuck out like a sore thumb to me.  All of those problems wouldn't have mattered if I wasn't Johnny No Friends and was with a huge group, so that's on my head, not the bar's :)  With all that in mind, I would definitely come back here, although I think it would have to be early in the night to try and get a seat!",

We were there late in the afternoon so the place wasn't too busy. The bar is unique and beautiful. (This isn't a review for the bar) We sat upstairs near the exterior patio, had a nice view of the outside. Our waiter was super nice and helpful. He recommended the world's best cocktails. We had a few drinks-- my favorite was the one with vodka, strawberry shrub and prosecco --and all of them were perfectly crafted. We each ordered a salad, not the crappy house salad but the most scrumptious plate of greens greatness we've ever tasted ( rare roast beef, blushed sherry tomatoes, soft boiled egg, crispy onions, sherry & nigella, and shaved parmesan!) I'm drooling just thinking about it. Wish I had taken better photo of it if I had known it was going to be the best plate of salad...ever! My sidekick ordered the crispy black pudding and blue murder salad. We tried black pudding all over town including Ireland. The Stornoway product they used there was the best!! We shared a plate of their chicken marinated with North African spices. It has pomegranate, bulgar wheat, rose harissa, pumpkin seeds and top with mint yoghurt. While it was delicious, THE salad took front and center stage!! We chatted with our server for a long time about living in Edinburgh and places to eat, and he was extremely generous with his knowledge of the city and even look up the address of another restaurant for us to try. We love this place and look forward to returning on our next trip to Edinburgh.",

Inside it has a very rustic feel with brick walls and candlelight. The bar area is the first area you see with a wall of whiskies. Upstairs you will find the restaurant with a balcony area for eating outside. Small selective menu with great vegetarian options. Food was fantastic and well presented. They have an unusual cocktail menu, none of the regular and more popular cocktails on the list however they can make you something if requested. I would definitely recommend trying one of the cocktails. Staff were knowledgable when asked several questions about the menu as we were there with friends from France they were able to answer any questions we had. Great knowledge about the whiskies as 1 of party asked for advice on what whisky to have based on what she liked and staff were able to recommend. I would definitely go again",

The Mangoes Into A Bar (Bruichladdich whisky, mango syrup, Peychaud's) completely impressed me - simply revolutionary. Not sweet at all and perhaps the most well-balanced whiskey cocktail I've had ever. The Double Standard (Millstone rye, Zuidam Genever, raspberry, citric) was visually deceptive (raspberry-colored) but packed a punch. Both drinks were complex and well-made.

I had s lovely glass of wine and cheese platter. The plate was amazing and completed as my dinner. Dinner didn't start until 5 so there was a small menu available and as I understand the items on that menu are not available once the dinner menu starts. I would suggest maybe ordering off the small menu at 445 as appetizer then at 5 dinner... if that could work.",

From the moment we walked in, the service was friendly and attentive.  The wine list hit all needs.  The food was really solid and the prices were insanely good.    All local foods!  We had the watermelon gazpacho, the Tweeds lamb special, pork chop, cheese plate and a smoked pineapple dessert.  We left comfortably full.  The charm. The casual cool elegance. The knowledgeable and friendly service.  5 stars.  Well done!!   Thank you for a wonderful memory.",

The only slight complaint I have is that I ordered the picanha \"a little pink\" and it came medium rare. I suppose that is my fault, however, for not specifying just how pink I liked it. When I asked for it to be cooked a bit more, everyone was extremely friendly and cooked it perfectly to my liking. It was excellent. Would definitely recommend this restaurant. By far one of the best in Edinburgh.",

    "text": "We had attempted to go somewhere else, but it was unfortunately closed. So we wandered aimlessly until we saw tourists photographing one of the many closes in Edinburgh.  The advocate close led us to a restaurant. At first we were slightly confused how to get in, but clearly you just keep going down the stairs and don't attempt the left turn.   They advertised a dinner menu at the door and we decided to lunch here. We were kind of expecting the prices for lunch to be a bit cheaper than the dinner menu. But perhaps that is the norm when dining in Edinburgh and with the proximity of the Royal Mile..  I ordered the Swordfish main that was 14, which I thought was reasonable. The waitress returned to say that there was a problem with the communication with the kitchen. They were all out of Swordfish! This only left about 4 mains options, apart from the grill options (steak etc). Nothing really appealed, but finally I opted for the Crispy Polenta main with poached egg, long stem broccoli and hollandaise sauce 14. My OH had the fish and chips 15.  I just want to say that we were both pleasantly surprised. The Crispy Polenta was a delicious dish. A bit like some sort of brunch dish, but I love brunch so this was ideal. The fish and chips were pretty awesome. The fish tasted really fresh and not that horrible oily-fatty way!  So glad we discovered this little wonder.",

The place was very busy with lots of people coming to gather at the bar and at the bar tables around the outside of the restaurant. Seems very popular in the area.

The staff were super helpful and friendly, they accommodated the 4 of us without reservation (don't forget to reserve a table here :)) because someone else canceled theirs.  Their scotch based cocktails were amazing. We tried almost all of them. Food menu is small but everything we ordered was fantastic. We will definitely come back here.

Admittedly, we did not dine here, but I loved the ambiance and excellent whisky collection.  This is a place that has a much more hip, modern vibe than most of its neighbor pubs in the Old Town area.  The ambiance reminded me of a quintessential hip New York bar, but of course the scotch whisky selection is far better!  In fact, we liked it so much here that we came back for a second visit in the span of 3 days.  We shared some snack platters along with our drinks, and the food was delicious. I know a place is good when I love their olives, because I typically do not enjoy olives... the ones here, however, were to die for.  Their prosciutto was excellent as well.  I cannot speak to the dinner food, but I would not hesitate to try it the next time I'm in Edinburgh.  They serve beers on tap in either full or half pints, which is handy in case you're not in the mood to guzzle a full pint.  I had one cocktail while I was here, a whisky one, and it was amazing.",

Apple maps actually functioned here for once, and led us straight to the little alley that I'm not surprised people miss, though I was slightly alarmed navigating the steep steps in early december, which unfortunately, are unavoidable. The tucked away alley is apparently always quiet, but the devil's advocate is always packed, dimly lit, cosy, small, and i'd even push to say ambience over atmosphere (micky flanagan jokes, and all that) you can mostly drink standing, there are a few tables you can sit at for bevies, but they're mostly for eating.   As a whisky drinker, she slurs, you've got a pretty damn good choice here, and not just scotch either. These guys now how to present a pretty bar but there are lists too so you don;t have to annoy every human tutting behind you who knows exactly what cocktail they want. The bar staff know their shizzle, they obviously know how to help tourists with no whisky experience under their belts at all. Again, be wary of the peaty ingredients if you aren't fan of smoke, expect florals and botanicals too, nice gin list as well, which if you ask me, is always worth noting. The platters are great sharers and assembled nicely, I was a big fan of the haggis bon bons, and my meat was cooked to perfection.  I do plan to visit again at some point, mostly because I flipping love edinburgh.",

I wasn't super hungry so I stopped in for an appetizer and some wine after a day tour. The place is hidden down an alley, which gives it unique character already.   I love the atmosphere and decor. I sat in a small booth off from the bar. The lighting is dark, the waiters are as hipster as they come and super friendly!  I ordered the soup, which was a courgette and fennel soup - it was divine!   I would definitely come back here next time I'm in town. Such a cool spot!",

The main was okay, it was well portioned, but the sauce was slightly bitter and it lacked depth. Truthfully, I probably make a roast that tastes better than their brisket. Dessert was the same. Not well balanced and just fell flat. Back to the service, it seemed like there was one woman who was warm and engaging. The rest made me feel like they were doing me a favor by being there.",

    "text": "Such an excellent (not so) hidden gem in Edinburgh!   Tucked away down Advocate's Close, this is such a great little nook - a place to enjoy the charms of the Old Town while hiding out from the crowds that come along with it.   I've eaten here a few times, most recently in mid-September. The menu was considerably more expensive than I'd seen it on previous visits: I'm not sure if this was a Festivals hangover or if they figured out they could charge more what they offer. It seemed like a bargain before, and a little over-priced this time at around 100 for two: that's with a shared starter, 2 mains, and a few cocktails.   The food is what I think of as high-end gastropub - with twists on some classics. This visit I had a potato soup take on haggis, neeps and tatties. For main, I went for the venison with winter berries, which was cooked perfectly but a little too sweet. I was glad to have ordered fingerling potatoes on the side to balance it out.   Where this place really excels is in its mixology. I love a gin martini and this place introduced me to the wonder of Death's Door gin in a martini - really smooth with a hint of vanilla. Though I usually go for clear spirits, this time I had an Encore, a concoction including Japanese whisky, strawberry vermouth, and balsamic glaze which was tangy and delightful. In every cocktail I've had here, each ingredient has really shone. The cocktail menu seems to change seasonally - find one with a couple of ingredients you like and give it a go.  All in all the meal I had this time wasn't quite as great as on past visits, but I'll be back.",

Very generous with advise and tasting.  We ended up ordering the scallops and serrano and were very pleased with the quality of the scallop dish.  It was delicious.

Also the laneway is called Advocate's Close which I thought was kinda cool. (Laneways and passageways and doors into streets - jeez Edinburgh you're mad covert)  Anyway. Back to the Devil's Advocate. The name is quite apt as it's a tempting dark spot with lots of naked flames around (gorgeous candles. If hell is like this, sign me up tbh). It's got that perfect mix of old and new - contemporary finishes over old, old stone. It envelopes you as soon as you go in and makes it rather difficult to leave.   They have an incredible selection of whiskeys. And knowledgeable and sound bar staff who can explain and recommend each and every one to you.  I didn't get to try the food but I bet it's great.

I'd heard nothing but good things about the Devil's Advocate but hadn't had the chance to try it out yet (I was gutted to miss Yelp Edinburgh's 3rd Birthday Bash here!), but then my mum was through and I met her for a drink before she got the train home. And where better located for a pre-Waverley-pick-me-up than DA?  You'd never know it was here if you started wandering up Advocate's Close from Cockburn Street, but then you turn the corner and voila! The space inside is lovely, I can only assume that it's been used as storage space for years, as a lot of the lower buildings of the closes have, and it still retains a bare feeling inside, with exposed walls complimented by warm woods and metals.  Alas as it was Burn's Night they were not serving food (other than the special Burn's menu for those who'd already booked), so no light bites for us, just drinks. The cocktail menu caught our eyes straight away - there are none of your traditional drinks on it (though I assume they'd make you a margarita if you asked for one), but everything sounds delicious and is helpfully sorted into sections like 'Sippers' with subsections of 'Short', 'Long' and 'Up'. We both plumped for the Whiskey Swizzle, which was delicious. I cannot remember what was in it (other than a rye whiskey), but it was fragrant, refreshing and had a good amount of kick to it.  We did only stay for one drink, but I'll definitely be back and my mum is already talking of bringing my dad here next time they're through. If this is where the Devil's legal representative drinks, then this law grad has gone to the dark side.",

The bf had the fish of the day (which was essentially fish and chips).  He thought it was good- I had a bite and wasn't too impressed but to each his own. It was served atop a bed of smashed peas- again interesting, but not the most complimentary combination in my opinion.   We had the chocolate tart for dessert and it was good- served with a scoop of strawberry ice cream. The chocolate is a bit strong, but it was fine for us.

We ordered a lamb burger, a roast beef salad (full size) and two Thistley Cross Whiskey Cask Ciders.  The burger was perfectly cooked, and was absolutely delicious. It came with chips that were amazing, and was topped with some kind of grilled onions that were to die for.   The roast beef salad was just as good, and came with a hearty portion of roast beef, mixed greens, perfectly ripe cherry tomatoes, soft boiled eggs, and some kind of balsamic dressing.   I also highly recommend the cider we ordered, it was probably the best drink I've ever had.   The restaurant itself is just as appealing as its food. It has a very dark and trendy theme, which fits well with it. Their drink menu is as thick as a bible, and the staff was really friendly and welcoming.   Make sure you call and make a reservation because it gets packed! We went on a Tuesday and we had to wait 30 minutes for a table.   If you live in or are visiting Edinburgh then definitely stop by the Devils Advocate for drinks and dinner, you will not be disappointed.",

Friendly/knowledgable bartenders, good cocktails, beer, and liquor selection plus a fine menu. My bartender was very honest when I asked him for his dish/beer recommendation. I got the beef cheeks and marrow pie, which was excellent. The large amounts of marrow and connective tissue gave it the semi-sticky mouthfeel of ox-tail. The bartender said he'd normally get a stout with it, but the stout of the day wasn't great and recommended a different beer (an IPA).",

Yeah they have beards tattoos and wear braces, but wait and just look at the clientele, it's popular with everyone - even that American tourist with the NY giants jacket on.  This place is cool, not effortlessly as a lot of thought has gone into it, but they certainly aren't trying too hard either. Listen if you like traditional, then this probably isn't your spot, and if you like uber modern, the same goes - try the royal mile or George Street respectively.   Great drinks selection, from cracking wines to an on trend beer range. The best part of the drinks list are their cocktails, it's a well thought out list perfectly executed every time. I like a bit of the speakeasy vibe, old school cocktails focused more on the base spirit and minus the gimmicks. Great structure to the food menu also makes this a very hard bar to move on from.",

A waitress came over when I found a seat and said they had table service, but \"he already left....\". We then didn't see her the rest of the night. Whoops!   There is no Guiness on tap. What.   Despite great reviews, we were not super impressed. The ambiance was great and we would have loved to give it another chance if there was Guiness on tap! That's a deal breaker.",

But I figured that I was in the land of Braveheart, so I thought I would give it a try. I was very glad I did.   The place is absolutely charming.  The alleyway entrance gives you a spectacular view of the city as you wind you way down the many steps to the entrance.  You walk in the doorway and the bar greets you with its magnificent backlighted wall of whiskeys. Magnificent.  Up the stairs you go for dinner. Our waiter Kelvin was an absolute delight and his recommendations were excellent. We had a wonderful and delicious experience, even if it was a bit difficult getting back up all the stairs that brought us down there in the first place. Ordinarily, I would give this place a 5, but the music selection was just terrible. Seriously, Don't serve delicious, amazing, Scottish food and drink and ask your patrons to listen to American pop music icons like Michael Jackson. Porter and whiskey don't taste as good when you are listening to \"Billie Jean!  It's just so our of character!  PS Eat up as they don't allow you to take away what you cant finish.",

Regardless though, it's an adorable restaurant with a nice candle lit atmosphere and the food was really good. I had the polenta with the poached egg and devoured the entire dish. I'd go back and even recommend it despite the unpleasant odors.",

The path is called \"Advocate close.\"   The place was very busy and we found a couple seats at the bar. I have very little experience with Scotch Whisky. The bartenders were very helpful with choosing some different whiskies for me to try. They had a huge selection and seemed to know about all of them. I asked for something in the range of 5-6 pounds. When I got the bill noticed the few that I tried were only 4 pounds. I was happy they didn't go the other direction in price. There was about a 30 minute wait for a table for dinner. We asked if we could eat at the bar. With some checking with the manager, they were able to accommodate our request.   We started with a really good Salmon Salad and spilt an order of fish and chips. Overall we had a pretty good experience!",

I visted the Devil's Advocate this time last year with my partner for an anniversary, with the intentions of going to a nice meal in a quiet restaurant, on the other side of town (we are based at the West End.) The Devil's Advocate did not disappoint! The overall quality of service, food and drinks given the price tag was well justified, we were thoroughly looked after and everything was lovely. The overall atomosphere of the place as well is amazing, a little secluded but by no means does this make it a quiet place, with a good bustle of business about it, making you realise it must be good if people are going a little out of the way to visit!

Lots of beer and whiskey to choose from -- we liked all we tried and the bartenders were cool too.  REALLY OLD BUILDING TOO -- which is always a plus.

    "text": "We honestly wouldn't have even known about this spot had my brother and his girlfriend not suggested it as our post-Arthur's Seat hike lunch spot. They'd had trouble finding it on their own a couple days before, so they figured four heads were better than two, and we found the restaurant in no time at all.  It was quite busy when we arrived, sweaty, hungry and thirsty. We hung out at the bar while we waited for our table (they said it'd be a 5-minute wait). The bartenders were friendly and handled the crush of people well. The thing that stunk was that of the 5 or 6 beers on tap, only three were available. And of course, the ones that we wanted to try were the ones that were sold out.  The wait was significantly longer than 5 minutes, which wasn't terrible because we had good beer and good company to while away the time. We were squeezed into a small table for four at the top of the stairs. It was cozy, but at least we had a place to get our food on.  Our waitress was also friendly, but it felt like she was a bit overrun with the number of people on that second floor. We ordered their meat and cheese platter (what they called the \"Ploughman's\"). I ordered the Highland Park 12 Ribs, and my husband ordered the Cashew & Chickpea Curry. My brother and his girlfriend had eaten a late breakfast, so they decided to share the fish and chips.  We all shared and loved the meat and cheese platter. It offered a good variety of cheese and pickles, as well as bread and meats.  The ribs were good, but I didn't taste the whisky; it was definitely overpowered by the BBQ flavor and didn't shine through. The sauce also overpowered the flavor of the meat, which was disappointing.   My husband actually ordered the curry because he wanted a vegetarian and non-fried-food meal. He said the curry was delicious, but the plate actually came with two large deep-fried pieces of squash, which he didn't end up eating.  My brother and his girlfriend seemed to enjoy their shared meal - my brother cleared his plate, her plate, the meat and cheese plate and some of the ribs off of my plate. He didn't touch the deep-fried squash because \"it's vegetables\", haha.  We did enjoy our time there, though it took much longer for us to get our drinks, eat and get out of there than we had hoped and planned on. We would go back if we visit the city again. We'd at least go back to see their draft beer selection.",

Off the path for sure and you need to walk into the close to get to it but you feel like you entered into a hidden lair.  In my opinion, the food was excellent.  Interesting menu with not too many options where you would get lost in trying to decide on what you wanted.  The service I experienced was excellent. The waiter was very attentive and provided some stellar recommendations.  I was really fond of the salmon charcuterie which is a nice departure from the typcal stuff you see at most other restaurants.  One interesting item cod and curried cauliflower!  This was a hit and I need to make it at home (or at least try).  I will be back here for sure.  Overall, I would recommend the Devil's Advocate the next time you visit Edinburgh.",

We had the roasted pepper soup, Black haggis fritters and mushrooms &spinach for starters.   The soup was amazing, very rich and complex with flavor including the harissa.   The mushrooms were very nice.   The haggis was just ok.  I think frying it took away from the actual flavor of the haggis.  For entrees we had the fish and chips and the roasted cauliflower salad.   The cauliflower was fantastic and maybe too large of a portion.   The fish and chips were good.   The batter was a bit too thick and there were large gaps between the fish and batter.   Still pretty decent.  The service was very attentive and good here.   I would definitely return to try new items.",

They have a ton of whiskys to choose from and our waitress was very knowledgeable in helping us through it. The food menu is smaller but has so many yummy options. My husband and I both got the soup of the day (sweet potato) served with a huge slice of fluffy bread and then we shared a chicken dish that had sundried tomatoes and potatoes. I LOVED the chicken, and am inspired to recreate it at home! 5 stars!!  The part of our evening that was annoying was the rush to get us out of the table. When I made the booking we were told we had the table for 2 hours - which is totally normal in Europe. I called later on to say we were running a half hour late but promise to have the table back by the end of our slot (9pm). When we arrived and sat down at 7:30 the waitress told us we needed to leave by 9. Got it, told her we knew that and that would be no problem. I think we told her that and another server we knew that about 5 times. It was SO annoying to keep being reminded! We told them we understood so their was NO need for the constant reminder. It really was frustrating. And like we had promised we were out before 9pm with extra time to spare!",

Drinks: - Duck, you sucker: sun-dried tomato infused rye, fig port, lemon, celery bitters - light and not too sweet or acidic  - Spice trade: like a whisky Bloody Mary with a good kick  - Scotch by the dram prices were reasonable   Food (lunch): - Tomato fennel soup: with sourdough. The bread was grilled but without oil or butter, so it tasted a bit like tobacco. The soup itself was a good texture and wasn't overly acidic. I like that it was not cream based  - Burger: on brioche, with cheddar and bacon. The beef had a good char grilled flavor, and I like that it was a tomato jam rather than ketchup on it. Fries were thin and salted well - Gnocchi: crisped / fried for more texture. It came with lots of vegetables (whole green onion, zucchini, eggplant, micro greens). It was a great dish that's vegetarian friendly   Cocktails are 7-10 each.   Notably: the decor is cool with all the stone and brick - I guess it was an old pump house.  For nicer weather, they have outdoor seating, too.",

Going to The Devils Advocate is like crossing over in to a mythical enchanted land. Through the large barn like doors and into a candlelit cave you are presented with a dark, rustic bar with exposed brick work - then to contrast this almost moody decor a smiling bubbly hipster member of staff bounces over and asks us where we would like to sit. It becomes clear at this point that this is not a simple bar but much more of an experience.  The drinks menu is full of mad scientist style beverages with ingredients jammed together that on reading you couldn't possibly imagine how they would infuse to create something that was even drinkable. On first perusal I was unsure of what to order but when I mentioned to the friendly member of staff that I loved rum he came up with a suggestion that included; Havana Club, Stout and Egg! I know what you're thinking, was this drinkable? Unbelievably it was, although it must be said that it was more like eating a desert than having a drink, but I didn't mind this at all - in fact I wish I had been given a spoon!   My visit was all to brief and next time I'm back in Edinburgh I will definitely be getting my compass out and navigating back to The Devil's Advocate.",

Pork chop and ribeye entrees were absolutely excellent; well prepared and flavorful.  Desserts were unique and outstanding.  Prices are a bit speedy but the place offers a fantastic experience.",

    "text": "It has finally happened, my first 5 star rating.  And every star is deserved.  Service. The difference between a good, great, or perfect place is in the amount of skill and knowledge involved.  The staff know their stuff.  Knowing a bit of whisky, I am impressed because there is not much I haven't yet tried.  I know what I like and what I don't.  Seldom if ever is it that I ask for a recommendation and I get something wondrous.  The Islay Old fashioned.  I was mildly astonished with the immaculate fInish on this.  Bartender explained every step to what he was making and was curious as to what malts I preferred.  Few questions later, he had my mind read.     The dry rob roy with Peat Monster.  Thought I had the best of the night with the previous drink.  This was in its own right, impeccable.   Other drinks had were neat single malts.  They house a desirable selection of whiskies, which arouse my envy.   It was a busy Saturday night as usual but even with just standing at the bar, we were perfectly content chatting away with great drinks.  A staff member even offered us a table twenty minutes later, saying seats opened up.  We politely passed on the offer, but it was amiable nonetheless.    Everyone in the bar were pleasant company, resulting in a medium background buzz in small group conversations.  Excellent drinks, good venue & tone, impeccable service. I felt my libations more than satisfied.",

    "text": "I was excited to try this place after I found it on several lists highlighting 'go to' whisky places to try while in Edinburgh.  Let me tell you, those lists did not lie, and this place did not disappoint. Over 200 whiskies in house (according to what I've read).   The place is located down Advocate's Close pretty close to the top of the Royal Mile.  You would never suspect that anything was down this sleepy little side alley. I arrived around 7pm on a Saturday, and it was hopping!  I had only one goal in mind, and that was trying a few different whiskies. I made my way to the bar and was amazed at the wall of liquor.  How do the reach the ones way up at the top??!!?   One barman in particular was very helpful at walking me through their whisky menu.  I described the type of whisky I liked, and he was happy to bring down a few options and let me choose.  He also taught me the 'proper' way to drink whisky (with a water dripper to adjust the whisky), which is something I've never seen back in America.  I tried three whiskies, and I really enjoyed two of them.  Best part was the value - judging from the final tally, I probably payed 4-5 per glass on average.  It would cost 2x as much back in the States!   Their cocktail menu is also impressive, as is watching the very talented barmen make the drinks with a steady, precise hand.  These guys are truly masters at their craft, as some of the drinks take several minutes to make.    Thank you Devil's Advocate for the whisky instruction and suggestions, and thank you Edinburgh for your affordable whisky!  I will return to Edinburgh, and I will call again at your fine establishment.",

There was a veggie butternut squash option on the lunch menu - however not fancying this I went for a medley of veggie starters and sides. I opted for mushrooms on toast, chips and side salad and it was mega tasty. We shared a bottle of White Burgundy, which was buttery, smooth and unoaked - unfortunately it was also 29 per bottle. Here's the sting with this place - they are expensive - especially the wines which ranged from about 23 to 60. However, it is just off a main tourist spot in Edinburgh - so I guess that's to be expected. The service was attentive and we had an awesome waiter who advised us well with our dessert option - the Buffalo Trail cocktail - refreshing and tasty. An awesome spot - but they could introduce a couple more affordable wines to their menu.",

My type of place absolutely -- warehouse type of feel but sophisticated and hip.   Service was awesome as well.

I was also given a recommendation for a cocktail that had pineapple in it, and even though I'm not a huge fan of pineapple, I enjoyed it very much.

From the moment we sat down, we were rushed to order our food so we could be out before the next table arrived. Two of our guests were late because of a ScotRail cancellation, and the remaining 4 of us apologized and explained the situation the situation whilst ordering starters and plenty of drinks.  We were approached by the manager twice, eventually forcing us to order our entrees. Our server nervously paced behind our table the entire time, needlessly coming over to remove items fill water cups in what felt like continued pressure to hurry. Remaining guests finally showed up, they were thrown two menus and forced to order on the spot. After all that, we still had to move to a table adjacent to where we were sitting for the final 15 minutes of our rushed meal.   Oh yeah, and by the time we paid our substantial check, the other party that was apparently so important had no even shown up.",

    "text": "Came here around 3pm for a late lunch, and the restaurant wasn't that full but it still took me 5 minutes to be seated. The servers were super friendly and informative, as they helped me select my whiskey - there were just so many options here! They had hundreds of different whiskeys to try!  In the end, I got one of the more basic / beginner whiskies (sorry, I don't remember which one exactly) and boy was it a great whisky! Even though I don't have much experience, it beats what I've drank in Canada and the USA. It tasted good, but was still quite strong!  I had the crispy black haggis as a starter! And boy was it better than I thought, the outside was deep fried so that's where the \"crispy\" came from. The inside actually tasted quite good, even though I was expecting something gross and nasty, but they seasoned and cooked it really well here, and it exceeded my expectations!  For the main, I had the Tweed Valley burger, and boy, this was one of the best burgers I've ever had. It's super juicy, tasty, delicious and greasy, but the good beef kind of grease. Everything about the burger was good, the bacon and the bread, just everything. And the chips were so delicious. They were freshly made chips and so fluffy with great texture - salted and fried perfectly!  This restaurant is so good, I'd definitely recommend. And when I'm back in Edinburgh, I'd love to try this place again!",

We ended off with a great chocolate and caramel dessert which was just great.   Check them out for yourself.",

Service, Ambiance, Food and Cocktails - what more can you ask for?!   Located down a few staircases, nestled in a perfect little location with downstairs, upstairs, and patio seating - this places was definitely one of my favorite stops on my trip!   Our server was absolutely incredible! The food was great and the whisky selection and cocktails served were amazing!   Haggis was cooked perfectly, Rare Beef starter was quite flavorful and both entrees were great: Pichana and Lamb Rump! The Pichana was seriously amazing - the best thing there in my opinion and the sauce provided with the lamp that was drizzled in the place was seriously delicious!   A MUST if ever in the area!   Have your server make her own coffee concoction for you - it will be great after dinner!",

The chef truly honors the ingredients available in a way that speaks to the locale, the heritage and the people of Scotland.  This is a Do Not Miss if you find yourself in Scotland make your way here for seriously the meal of the year. In addition to the over 300 Scotch Whiskey list you will find a lovely wine list from Austria to California. We could not be happier and I plan to book in for a dinner as well.  Recommend reserving a table for either lunch or supper- you will NOT be disappointed.  The building is incredibly historic with amazing stone work, worn from centuries of use, the fresh lit (and real) candles the rustic tables and the absolute authenticity of the period shine through like you arrived off the boat from England to claim your seat at the table.

    "text": "The last three times I've been to Edinburgh, I have wanted to eat at The Devil's Advocate. We always ended up having drinks but not being able to get food since it was always so slammed. I really enjoyed the cocktails we had, specifically mine. It was strawberry flavored and tart. Unfortunately I forget the name. While stopping in for that drink, we grabbed reservations for our last night and I am so glad I did.   The servers were all very kind and friendly. After sitting down, we perused the menu for a bottle of wine and our appetizers. I chose the soup of the day with thick sliced bread.  It was a puree of tomatoes and roasted red peppers. The bread was fresh and the butter, as always, delicious.    For my meal, I went with the chicken breast topped with pine nuts, tomato, olives and roasted potatoes.  It was cooked perfectly, still juicy and very well seasoned. It was probably one of my favorite meals in Edinburgh because the flavors were so unique. My **fiancee** (that is brand new so I am using it haha) got a really good cut of cod, which even I enjoyed. My mother had the pork chop with kraut and pureed yams. Pork is difficult (for me) to cook but it was tender and delicious. My father got the rib eye with chimichuri sauce. They said it was one of their favorite meals as well since it tasted so homemade. I can't wait to come back to have it again.",

You walk into the bar area which is an open floor with some high top tables.  Most of the dining tables are on the second level.    Great atmosphere (loud with great tunes) on a Friday night!  I arrived around 9 pm so seated right away but would recommend reservations during peak meal times.  The kitchen does close at 9:30 although they are open late.  I decided to go with a couple of starters vs getting an entree.  Started with the Crispy Haggis which was exceptional!  The Advocate's version with The roasted red pepper jam balanced perfectly with the salty of the Haggis.   Second starter was the small (perfect for one) Smoked Fish Board.  A nice mix of Lax, Smoked Salmon & Mussels with beet relish and pickles.  Excellent!   The Parmesan Truffle chips are a must try!  Paired it all with The Vienna Lager (local).  Service was also excellent with my servers providing extra details on the menu & drink options!  Will return to try some of the Mains!",

It's a little hard to find as it's down a side street, Advocate Close, but once you arrive you're greeted in an amazing old building by a friendly staff and a creative menu with an extensive whiskey list. I had a drink off the menu, Fizz Me Now, which was refreshing and well balanced. My husband asked for something along the lines of an Old Fashioned and they delivered with a whiskey twist. After that, we described what we liked to drink and the bar tender, Will, surprised us with delicious concoctions. We had two more drinks and each was better than the last. Will also showed us the base spirit he used and described the flavor profile. Very helpful when navigating all the whiskey and gin Scotland has to offer! We also had the charcuterie board to snack on and it's one of the best I've had in long time. The cured and potted meat was great and the accoutrements were the perfect pair. Two relishes, one of capers and cornichon and another that had egg yolk and spicy peppers really made the plate. We shared a half board and that was the perfect snack for two. This place is a must go if you're ever in Edinburgh!",

The staff was super friendly and recommended us dishes to try since we've never eaten in Edinburgh before.  We went for the Black Haggis, Fish and Chips, and the Picanha Steak.  It was our first time having black haggis and it was super delicious. The texture of the inside was grainy and the batter was super crisp and paired well together The salsa-like salad on the bottom had a good contrast in texture and the light flavor really went well with the haggis.   The fish and chips was okay. The piece of fried cod was quite large and  the portion size was generous. The batter was crispy and not too salty. The cod was flaky but didn't have much flavor. Since the tartar sauce wasn't too zingy and light in flavor, I think the cod should've had more seasoning. I think the chips really saved this dish. They're a thicker cut of fries (similar to steak fries).   The steak was really delicious and cooked perfectly. I think the whiskey dipping sauce they gave really complimented the natural smokiness of the steak. It wasn't too heavy or oily. I recommend getting the steak over the fish and chips as an entree.  Had a wonderful time eating at The Devil's Advocate and definitely recommend it to anyone who is visiting Edinburgh.",

Great beer & G&T's, too. Will return on our next visit.",

For dinner I had the courgette soup, and the rare roast beef salad, which had so many layers of flavor and texture. Really good stuff.

I am not a fan of smokey whiskey and only the glenmorangie had a touch of smoke.  The cheese & meat platter was also delicious.  Had everything I look for in a proper cheese plate (but would have been better with toasts rather than chunks if bread).  I will say that my waiter was going hard on the upsell which totally put me off.  He tried to sell me more whiskey after I drank my own sampler and made me wait about 20 minutes for the \"scotch expert\".  He also asked me if i wanted bread with my cheese plate.  I said of course but he failed to mention the plate already came with a good amount of bread!  I told him I didn't want it and he took it off the bill but I know that was a sneaky move and I did not appreciate it.  Don't try to trick me into ordering more stuff I won't eat. I am sure many feel bad and don't say anything.  He probably gets away with it because he is hot. Make a reservation, this place gets crowded.",

We got a table for 4 and only one hour and fifteen minutes to order-eat-vacate... I went diesel with a Courgette Carpaccio, heritage tomato, buffalo mozzarella & olive vinaigrette and a portion of Straw Chips. As you can see in the pics attached the starter size was smaller than the title itself...So, yes, it was tasty, healthy and minuscule... My friends ordered the Tweed Valley Beef Burger & the Teriyaki Salmon, both (taste-wise) on the satisfactory side of the scale. The service was friendly but a bit amateurish as the waiter-dude almost dropped a 33cl bottle of sparkling water on us from his unstable tray (he managed to catch it in time, though) and when we got the bill they add the wrong glass of wine which was  3 dearer than the one that my mate got. We pointed that out and the bill was kindly corrected by waitress Nastassia. Pros: handsome stone & wooden interiors, lovely atmosphere, cool food menu and friendly service. Cons: Expensive; considering the portion sizes/price ratio. Wouldn't mind to go for an encore... And yes; we managed to free the table before 14:15...",

I had the beet and tomato puree (soup) and finally warmed up after and afternoon of wandering around in \"warm, sunny, Scotland.\"    I had the lamb burger-cooked to perfection with an excellent flavor profile of goat cheese, beet root, and middle Eastern spices.  My companion had the roast beef salad-tender juicy chunks of med rare roast beef doused with olive oil on a fresh bed of sophisticated greens with a sprinkling of sharp cheese.   Unlike other diners, we stuck with beer, bit wet did try the desserts.  Save room-I had the lemon and my companion had the chocolaty mousse and we BOTH contemplated living the bowl!

We made a reservation (essential!) and went for dinner on a Friday night, and loved the food, but not much else.  Setting:3 stars. Really cool space, but they were blaring rap music so loudly that I could barely hear anyone speaking. People walking in seemed rather baffled as well -- it was just weird for the setting. Also, FULL of hen parties on a Friday night.  Service: 2 stars. When we went to ask about our reservation, we were told we were early (we were there 5 minutes early) and we should not have asked until it was exactly time. The hostess told us not to ask again, but to go wait, and she would find us. She was rude and brusque, but I figured it was late, loud, and she was tired. But then, she never bothered to get us. We watched her chat with friends for 20 minutes and pointedly ignore us... finally, we got frustrated and went upstairs, where the waiter was like \"oh, there you are, we've had your table ready, what were you doing???\" Ok then. Once we were seated our waitress was helpful enough, but when we got the bill she manually zeroed out the tip line. I wasn't sure if that was because she wanted to force us to give her a cash tip, or didn't want any tip... but I was confused. Maybe it's a cultural thing?  Food: So this is the redeeming part. I had the burger, and my husband had the ribeye. Both were cooked perfectly, and they were amazing. We'd had a lot of lack luster food, so this was a pleasant surprise. Both entrees were quite salty, but it worked. 5 stars.  TLDR: sure, stop by if they aren't busy, but not my scene on a Friday night. Loud, rude staff, but good food.",

We turned up for lunch on New Year's Eve and politely asked, as we sat down, if we could have some water - only to have the waitress/manager (dark hair, red dress/top, permanent scowl)  snap at us: 'That comes automatically.'.  Well it didn't come automatically, even though there was another waiter standing 4 feet away who heard us but then walked off (the place was pretty empty and we were the only ones in our section at that point). My lunch companion needed to take her medication so I got up and grabbed one of the water jugs he had been standing right next to; when he eventually returned and saw that we had done this, we got another waft of attitude from him.  The food: ordered the corn fritters and monkfish scampi; the fritters tasted bhaji-esque, and not in a good way  - sort of oily and muddy and mushy - and the fish was pretty forgettable ( all they'd done with the accompanying cauliflower and parsnips was boil and salt them and plonk them in a bowl without bothering to properly drain it all). It's even more disappointing given the fantastic, unfailingly friendly and helpful service and hospitality we experienced everywhere else off the Royal Mile that week.",

All wood and mismatched chairs and tables, the place has a very cool vibe about it.   We had a very warm welcome upon entering the bar. It wasn't busy but there was a few people dotted around. Clearly these people have heard of the new bar on the grapevine as I can't see how it'll ever get any passing trade tucked away as it is although there is a hotel next door. We were greeted by the bar staff and shown to a table upstairs. They only started serving food from Sunday so only had a small menu on offer. No mind! The steak and pork burger for me and the steak sandwich for my partner. What I liked about it was their \"no problem\" attitude when I changed my dish, swapping blue cheese for cheddar and removing the black pudding. I felt the food options were slightly over complicated and fussy however I can see what they're trying to do which is take simple dishes of burger, macaroni, haggis etc up a level.  Although neither of us were drinking I checked out the small cocktail menu and wine list. Looked interesting and quite reasonable. They made 2 lovely bramble and apple virgin cocktails for us so we could get a small flavour of what the bar staff could do. Yum!! The waiter serving us was extremely friendly and likable.   I'd like to come back at a time when I'm not driving and when their food menu is a little more extensive. If they can match the same quality of service at a busier time they'll definitely get 5 stars!! And you guys know how tights I am with my stars. Haha :)",

Firstly location; for me being a two minute walk to the the train station is a big positve for this train spotter. Secondly the staff and service is second to none! polite and attentive. Thirdly great ambience, including lighting, atmosphere and fun! Lastly food and drink is very good.  So...I was chuffed to hear Yelp was having their 3rd birthday there! We were all given a little party bag of goodies, our glasses were filled with a drink of our choice and my goodness cake..lots of cake ! and what can i say about the cake?!?! Delicious! Light and fruity!  Thank you for a fabulous evening full of yelp goodness ! Happy Birthday ! xx",

We came across Advocate's Close and decided to walk through and see what was on the other side. We ended up finding this place and decided to go inside and see if they had a table available. They did, and this was one of the best meals I have enjoyed in quite a while. I had a meat pie with braised oxen cheeks and marrow. Delicious. The atmosphere is fantastic. It is a little dark on the inside but comfortable and cozy. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "edinburgh is a wonderful city which is absolutely chock full of excellent bars and restaurants, but part of me (a small part) always felt that something was missing.  i didn't know what or why i even thought that, but on a cold wintry thursday evening i came across the 'something missing' in Devil's Advocate.  being asked to suggest a good place to go for some dinner and drinks, i immediately suggested this new bar in old town.  i'd had its praises sung to be by those that had been and i thought it was time i tried it out.  now i won't lie, finding this place isn't exactly easy.  i actually had a fall out with my taxi driver about the location of Advocate's Close.  thankfully i convinced him to drop me off nearby enough that i was soon skipping down the steps to find the bar.  there was a lot of steps....and i thought maybe i'd got the address wrong, but then just as i was giving up hope a beacon of light (and well mixed cocktails) appeared to my left and i entered through the glass doors.  i was immediately in love with this place.  The Devil's Advocate is all glass, brick, and cool industrial chic.  the building has massive glass windows looking out onto the close which must bring in loads of sunlight during the day.  in between all this glass is exposed brick and clean wooden tables with a mezzaine for with tables for the restaurant.  on arrival i had a g&t at the bar before we headed upstairs for dinner.  the menu is short and sweet, which i hopes means that they focus on what they're good at.  not a load of veggie options if you are one of those, but a good choice of other options overall.  i went with the salmon tartare for my starter and the pearl barley and beetroot risotto for my main.  my dining partner had the haggis crouquettes (or bon bons i can't remember) for starter and a steak sandwich for the main.  we split a bottle of sauvignon blanc as well.    the wine was with us shortly and was quite nice!  a wee bit pricey, but nothing i wouldn't expect of an edinburgh restaurant.  starters arrived not too long after and my salmon tartare was just lovely!  so so fresh and the slices of crostini with it were so crisp.  i would have enjoyed a bit more of the sauce on the plate, but hardly need to complain as the salmon itself was so tasty.  i was assured that the haggis was also quite good, but passed on the option to try it as i'm not a fan of the offal.  after a top up of the wine, mains arrived and i was well pleased with my risotto.  the pearl barely was super tasty and the beetroot was of the golden variety instead of the red that annoyingly stains everything.  the steak sandwich appeared to be quite satisfactory and i can assure you that the chips were also good having been given one to taste.  in leiu of dessert we went for some cocktails off their list.  if i'd been clever i would have written the names of these down as by that point we'd finished off the wine.... however, my whisky cocktail was certainly top quality and sort of had a tea like flavour.  like a long island iced tea except with whisky, so much classier.  my dining companion had a gin based cocktail that was seriously strong but also seriously good.  in addition to the good food and excellent cocktails, the staff at the Devil's Advocate are just lovely!  quite to serve you and helpful with questions about the menus, checking on you during your meal but not being overly obtrusive so you can also enjoy your meal.  they also seem happy to let people sit as we were there for almost 4 hours, and never once got asked for our table back.  seriously, i think i'm a little in love with this place.  it's just the sort of place the edinburgh was missing and just the sort of place i know i'll want to go back to over and over again!  already planning my next visit....",

Washed down with an excellent Chilean Pinot Noir. Perfect for a chilled Friday night meal!  The staff were outstanding; friendly and attentive.

Well it is fab - love the bare walls, the excellent use of space, the cosy, under the mezzaine booths and the lovely ladies toilets. Full, amazing range of wine's and spirits as you'd expect and staff here also provide the same attention to detail touches on service that you come to expect as a regular to TBV.   I was here for the wines and spirits tasting - boozy as you'd expect, but it was great to grab a booth and chill out with plenty of water being provided to help balance the tastings we'd already indulged in, and were to still indulge in. Food menu is smaller than TBV so the Devil's Advocate will clearly focus more on drinks, but on some nights out, that won't be a bad thing!  So, I'll definitely be back - I just need to decide what I fancy drinking next!",

They all contain the easy to remember work 'Advocate' after all. Despite this geography-by-numbers approach to getting around town it still took me a while to find the place, so please do allow extra time if you're me.  Once inside it's really nice. Big doors, high tables, steep steps, distant ceilings: they've achieved a TARDIS-like effect with much going on inside a relatively small premises. Three stars gives them room for improvement, though in truth I suspect my general level of energy was a limiting factor to the good time I had here. It was still good though and clearly a place worth knowing about with its central location in no way compromised by the adjacent madding crowds. Please go.",

    "text": "We were in Edinburgh for a weekend trip and after having dinner we asked the manager to recommend a good bar nearby.  We were looking for a place that wasn't touristy and had a good selection of whiskeys.  The manager recommended The Devil's Advocate which is located down the stairs of the Advocate's Close off of the Royal Mile.  We walked into the bar and instantly fell in love.  The decor is simple, cozy and well done.  Everyone was friendly and once we found our spot for the evening we got comfortable.  Our server was very knowledgeable and helped us through a mini whiskey tasting.  The great thing is that he charged us for tasting pours and not for full glasses which I thought was very honest of him.  He could've easily taken advantage of us being tourists.  After trying seven different whiskeys our bill came out to 29.65 GBP.   We loved the bar so much we went back the next day for lunch.  To our surprise the bar looked even more welcoming in the daytime. We ordered four drinks, one appetizer (had to try the haggis bonbons) and three entrees. Our bill came out to 51.30 GBP for three people.  Everything we ordered was delicious and the service for lunch was again friendly and great.  Overall, whether you're looking for an awesome bar to hang out or a place to enjoy a nice lunch, The Devil's Advocate is your go to place.  They definitely have the right concept, look and hospitality that will make it many people's favourite in the city.",

This restaurant came up many times from friends, the internet, and forums of what to try when in Edinburgh. I have to say, I don't really get it. Of four of us, nobody loved their meal. Nobody hated it (except me), either. The menu was just too out there and the food we got just wasn't really amazing. The mussels were okay.  The staff was hit and miss. One really nice bartender, another who was rude. Really nice host who sat us, fairly rude server. Personally I'd definitely look elsewhere, unless you're here for all the whisky which in and of itself was also cool too. However, they were out of the first 2 whiskeys we asked for, which was disappointing. I'd skip over this if it were me. Better places elsewhere.",

Even though they need a quick turnaround on tables, the staff is super friendly and I never felt rushed. They are a locally sourcing restaurant so I decided to give it a go.  Food service was fast. I ordered the truffle and hollandaise chips and the fried polenta with poached egg. Both were excellent. Great flavor, well seasoned. The only thing I wished for was my yolk to be a bit more runny than solid, but other than that, I'm really glad I gave this place a try. All in all I was also in and out in 50 minutes with a belly filled with awesome food. Portions were just right too.

The staff is amazing and thoughtful in their recommendations and suggestions (even when I asked the bartender for other restaurant recommendations). My only knock is the cocktails are hit or miss. I had four during my two visits this Fringe: loved two, liked  one, was not impressed with the last.",

I had the lobster and it was slightly overcooked, but everyone else enjoyed the meal - the stew was probably the most praised dish at dinner.  We somehow managed to fit in their version of creme brulee at the end and it was a perfect finish to a delicious meal.  The tiramisu was a large portion size so I recommend splitting it, but absolutely save room for it.",

    "text": "Came to the Devil's advocate while trying a series of cocktail bars. Didn't come for the food, just the drinks and I give it a solid 3/5.   Drinks (3/5) LOVE the fact that all their drinks are taken from Scottish Folklore e.g. the Kelpies which inspired a series of \"sea\" ish drinks but I wasn't very impressed by any of the drinks I saw on the menu. I suppose I'm kind of biased because I like sweeter drinks, and it's very possible these cocktails were more salty/tangy to go well with the food serve, but there didn't seem to be many options for me. I ended up going with the \"Black Dog\" which tasted like a strawberry/apple whisky sour (but not as sour!). I also tried a bit of the \"Fisherman's Folly,\" which is surprisingly good! I didn't know what to expect because it had seaweed but it tastes mildly like the ocean; very refreshing. Finally the \"Curiosity killed the Captain\" which struck me as a lime-y watermelon war head (but maybe not THAT sour). While the drinks are interesting, I didn't fall in love with any of them  Service (3/5) We were greeted (read: carded) immediately as we walked in, handed menus, and ushered to the bar. The bartenders were nice but they weren't interested in making conversation. They made the cocktails you ordered (on the opposite side of the bar...), asked you to pay, then left. Hit the basics, wasn't impressive.  Ambiance (3/5) Nice, small, mood lighting, intimate. The only downsides were 1) there wasn't enough space at the bar and 2) they had a freshly roasted pig leg at the bar which meant the entire place reeked of meat. Not appetizing.",

Not baby or handicapped friendly. It's down a little back street with lots of steps.  Did I mention this place was loud.  The food was..ok. The menu had a limited selection of food choices (5 appetizers and 8 entrees to chose from) and everything tasted good but nothing that will blow your mind. Just your wallet and ear drums.

Very brusque, and staff seemed overwhelmed. Plus we were asked to hurry up halfway through our mains because a reservation had arrived and they needed our table. Why even bother to seat us at all?  Drinks: 3 stars. Some interesting cocktails, and had a truly excellent drink. Expensive for what you get, however, and wine list is both average and overpriced.  Experience: 0 stars. Came in with a friend on a late Friday afternoon/early evening. The place was packed, and several drunk people were stumbling around, including one guy who literally pushed a woman out of his way at the bar and spilled her Champagne, no acknowledgement or apology. He was then immediately served and pushed his way back through people, slopping his beer everywhere. Yes, he was an asshole but clearly over served. Crowd in general was mixed but trended toward hipster millennials who nursed drinks and empty glasses, taking constant selfies and talking as loud as humanely possible.

Delicious, well prepared, well presented pub food -- with an inventive and varied cocktail list to match.  It's a little hard to find unless you know where to look -- keep your eyes peeled for a tiny alleyway, with a deceptively ferocious set of steps leading downwards towards the restaurant (which will be on your left).  Highly recommend any cocktail on the menu -- but if available, be sure to try to Button Up (gin, vermouth, mushroom, mint and moss). Light and refreshing the way the mushroom essence subtly lingers, and it remains perfectly chilled by a frozen stone cube.  The food is delicious too. And it's a spacious, warm venue.  Customer service cannot be beat either. Be sure to ask for Kelvin -- he is a real sweetheart!",

    "text": "Prices for dinner: between 18 to 30 pounds for an entree.   If you're a tourist seeking traditional Scottish fare, this probably isn't where you want to go. If you just want a delicious dinner and some tasty drinks, then head on over. We came across this place when we spotted their alleyway splitting off from the Royal Mile. I had seen the rave yelp reviews and decided to give it a try. You might not be so lucky trying to get in on a whim though. It does look like their reservations book up. We just happened to get lucky with our walk in, probably because we were going for an early dinner. Point is, get a reservation if you want to grab dinner here.   Food here is amazing. I got the grill of the day, which happened to be lamb for the day I went, and my husband got the picanha (steak). Both were wonderfully tender and cooked perfectly. Each also came with sweet potato, an arugula salad, and grilled portabello mushrooms on the side. Each person also got to choose a sauce on the side. I went from bernaise and my husband got the garlic puree. We only used it on the vegetables though since the meat was perfect on its own.   We also both opted for a pint of beer. I got the blond and he got the stout. He's a craft beer enthusiast and one sip of each seemed to put him in beer heaven.   This meal was the perfect start to our Edinburgh adventures.",

The restaurant is located along a \"close\" which is basically a stairway that connects the upper and lower parts of old town Edinburgh. The restaurant is located in an old building and rustically furnished commensurate with the old town period. Their food was excellent. I had the Sauteed wild mushrooms, garlic puree and rosemary croutons starter and the Beetroot tarte Tatin, toasted seeds, goat cheese and heritage tomato salad entree. I also the Chorizo, manchego and chilli chips side. All were delicious. Service was excellent. The restaurant was busy; expect a wait unless you have reservations. I definitely recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "BEWARE...CAUTION...so, high expectation met with reality. This is a prime example of what happens when a European restaurant gets high reviews on Yelp and cannot keep up with the demand...of tourist Americans ( which I am). We booked a reservation for 9pm and were seated at around 9:15. Prior to that we had one of their signature cocktails at the bar which were average at best. The place was packed..,with American Tourists. When seating, nothing on the menu was what what described on Yelp. Great, they change their menu but seems it was downgraded to chicken and pork.  Finally, at around 9:30, maybe later, the server came by and simply asked us what we wanted.  No Hi, how are you etc. we to,d her we would start with  a \"starter\" and have some questions to which she replied, you better hurry, the kitchen is closing. While waiting in the server, I had ordered a beer from the bar called a blonde. It tasted like a wheat, grapefruit, strawberry, rice, cinnamon, insert 10 other flavors, and it was undrinkable. So even before the snotty server came to our table, we were a little miffed. The terrible beer, the average cocktails, the long wait, the extremely loud patrons, the supper small packed in table, we left. Fortunately, the restaurant next door, Angels with Bagpipes, was able to seat us and we had an amazing meal. Through crisis comes opportunity I guess. Very disappointing.  I guess I should have been suspicious to the sign in the door looking for help.",

    "text": "When you've had a stressful morning, walked the streets of Edinburgh all day and have some time to waste before your reservation at The Witchery, what do you do? You decide to walk down some random alley (in this case the spectacular Advocates Close) that Edinburgh is littered with, that's what you do. Then, you stumble across a place like the Devil's Advocate and you decide that sitting down for a pre-dinner drink drink is a fantastic idea - and what a fantastic idea it was!  The Devil's Advocate is quite hidden, especially for people who do not frequent Edinburgh half as often as they should. I love the interior all wooden and steel, medieval, kind of thing, it was bustling which was brilliant especially because it was a week night, and their bar is perfectly stocked - with a selection of 200 whiskeys no less. We were seated at a two persons table for drinks. Unfortunately it was on the way to the bathrooms and the kitchen, but fortunately this didn't create too much through traffic.   The girl who was waiting on us was nice enough, she definitely fit the slightly hipster vibe of this place. We didn't see much of her, but she did recommend an amazing lager/IPA hybrid: The Williams Bros. Brewing  Co. Caesar Augustus. Amazing. It went down a treat, and then something incredible happened. For the first time in my life I ate something that in South Africa they call \"Corn nibs\". A fantastic bar snack, it's essentially dried little bits of sweetcorn with some seasoning. My word, they were amazing (and subsequently I did buy some the next time I went to South Africa), and the only reason that we did get them was because the kitchen was already pretty much closed. A little bit of a downer was that we had to pay for this bar snack - it felt a little like being charged for eating the peanuts that you find on the bar counter.   Their menu looks very inviting, with a lot of focus being put on Scottish produce. Next time I would to see what the upstairs-mezzanine seating area is like. I cannot wait to come back.",

Basically looking like it was carved into the Edinburgh rock, the DA looks very much like a speakeasy in terms of a secret location and from here it was nicely off the beaten path on the Royal mile to avoid shedloads of tourists looking for a quick pint.  We had a quick snack of haggis bonbons - really nice and definitely fulfilling my Haggis needs on this trip, plus a board with serrano ham and manchego cheese, plus fresh bread was the perfect combination for a late afternoon snack.   My pals had cocktails from the extensive list which all sounded pretty exciting but I stuck to the beers as usual. I was very impressed with the Jokers IPA (super hoppy but drinkable at 5%) plus the locally brewed Alba, coming from an ancient Viking recipe - top notch and a very unique brew!   The DA is on my hit list to recommend to anyone who goes to Edinburgh now - very impressed!",

The service is pretty slow and not too friendly (a symptom of the busy business I guess). The food is pretty good. Everything is slightly under seasoned (a trend we've noticed in this city) but not so much so the food is bland. This is a great place if you're not in a hurry and just want to snack, drink, and relax. Definitely a place worth trying again.

It is by the team from the Bon Vivant of Thistle Street and Stockbridge. Who serve fab food and delectable cocktails in both establishments. The Devils Advocate is in a very atmospheric location and the feeling of intrigue of walking down a misty close is fantastically complemented byt the warm and intriguing view through the glass windows. The building used to be an old pump house and they have retained a lot of the old features keeping it quite industrial and putting in a mezzanine floor - great for people watching! It manages to be spacious but snug at the same time. The cocktails were great and of the same quality as those served at the Bon V you will be glad to know.

The crowd here was a little older than I'd have expected in a similar establishment in NYC (people were mostly 40+), but the space was intimate enough that it didn't feel odd.    Now the food.   It was good, very good.  I got a pork dish and my wife got a fish dish and they were both cooked perfectly; my pork dish was well spiced, my wife's fish dish had a broth that didn't overpower the natural flavor of the fish.  Overall it was an excellent meal.  in NYC or Paris I'd give the experience 4/4.5 stars, but for Edinburgh this is top notch, definitely not just a sexy location!  Our final bill was 60 pounds (2 mains + 2 appetizers + 2 drinks), a very reasonable cost.",

    "text": "Walking up or down the Advocate's alley you will find the bar/pub style place tagged away from the busy main road called the Royal Mile. The front of the building has massive windows and these additions to the exterior gives this place identity and certainly light.  Inside its warm and the walls thick. Wi-Fi connection a no no, at least for some. The interior presents a modern romantic combination.   I recently attended Yelps 3rd birthday party, which was held on the upper floor. Downstairs is the bar and some tables. I heard the food is excellent. It seems you can hire the upper floor for functions.  We were received very nicely and all of us were handed a glass of excellent prosecco. I think the brand was called WOLF.  Really loved the prosecco. It's really hard to find a good one.  I can recommend this place for singles and couples alike, less for a family outing so.",

    "text": "I can only rate this place for its venue and drinks, as I have not yet tried the food, but was so impressed with the look of this place I will definitely go back for food soon!! I like this space a lot better then Bon Vivant (same owners), merely because it is a bit bigger and has a very rustic, new hip interior. It is also a neat location off the Royal Mile. The service was excellent and the drink selection is extensive. I was a bit overwhelmed by the amount of whiskey they had, but would recommend this to anyone who is after a nice whiskey. This will certainly be my after dinner whiskey destination. The whole decor of the place is so nice and it felt very warm and cozy despite being quite a bit bigger then it feels. They have some nice, cozy booths you can tuck into or table seating upstairs. A great place to grab a drink and hopefully I can make it to dinner here soon!!",

    "text": "I had heard of The Devils Advocate but I had never been before, so I was delighted to be on the guest list for Yelps 3rd birthday celebrations which were held there. You can get to the venue on Advocates close from the Royal Mile at the top of the back of Waverley station at the bottom.  It isn't the best signposted so it feels like it is a best kept secret of those in the know.   The inside is over two levels and we had the upstairs mezzanine for the birthday celebrations.  The bar is located on the main floor.   I really like the feel of this place.  The designers have stripped it back to the exposed bricks and added a touch of industrial feel with caged display sections behind the bar.  All the chunky and rustic wooden tables and lighting give it a really warm feeling full of character. The Yelp birthday cake was beautiful, I had the gluten free cake which was the veggie option and it was delicious!  Very more-ish indeed. The staff were top notch.  I would certainly come back here the next time I am out in the Edinburgh old town.",

The did not try to fill it full of tables to limit your ability to move around, it is tight though.  Bare is very industrial looking with large cages holding a large selection of whiskey's with just enough light to show off the wonderful shades of each whiskey.  The wine list and drink menu is diverse covering the customer who knows something to the customer who wants to try something out.  Staff was attentive and kept a very tidy bar and serving areas,  coffee at the ready upstairs for before and after meals.  1st floor both seating looks perfect for privacy and intimate dinning with just the right amount of surrounding atmosphere to keep it a enjoyable night out with just a friend.  Off the Royal Mile down a close next to the real Mary's Close will make this a perfect stop before a tour of the old buried city streets of Edinburgh Scotland.",

So I Yelped and up came with the Devil's advocate which was close by.  Given we were tired and hungry, we agreed to find it.  Its in one of the side alleys or \"close\" so not on the beaten path.  Once we stepped in, we were impressed by the beautiful interior of this modern version of the pub (more of a restaurant really).  They had the usual selection of beers and whiskeys to choose from and there was a nice crowd in the bar area.  We quickly found a table for 8, and ordered.  Everyone loved their food! From the burger to the fish and chips, everyone raved about their order (and we are all foodies), so this was a huge hit.  So much so that we wanted to eat there on the return trip through E'burg, but couldnt find time.  Definitely check this place out!!",

This place is down one of the many closes in the city of Edinburgh so turn down this narrow walkway, go down some steps, and then here is the pub nestled among the tall gothic buildings of Edinburgh.  The interior is insane, stone and wood everywhere.  Me and the S.O. were seated right away and given an extensive drink menu.  Their whiskey list is extensive.  I wanted to try all the drinks, they all sounded so good.  The ones I did try were phenomenal.  Our server then chatted us up a bit and recommended other things to do in Edinburgh (since it was our first night there).  Friendly staff?  Check.  Didn't try to food but I imagine that's good too.  So I'm going to take my review above and beyond dope ambience and say that this place is ambient af.  In Edinburgh?  Like booze? Go here.",
