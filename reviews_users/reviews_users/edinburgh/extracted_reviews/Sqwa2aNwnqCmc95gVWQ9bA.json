Although a little smelly at times, it is so relaxing to sit in there with a pint and chat with mates. They play films (not sure of the times) but it's a great place. Doesn't seem to get too full of students despite it being in a student area. The staff are slightly cold, but nothing too bad. I love this bar.",

    "text": "The Brass Monkey, in theory, should be a place you'd avoid if you are not a student. This is because it is a student bar- quintessentially, and due to its proximity to faculties of the University of Edinburgh. However, this is only in theory. In reality, the Brass Monkey is a great little bar for anyone. Including Gordon Brown. Whose picture is on the wall opposite the bar. Take note, Mr. Brown probably only visited the place to get in on the youth demographic. In other words, the place had more to offer him than he to it. The Brass monkey does screenings everyday in the afternoon (and there is a pie and soup special to be had). This takes place in the unique 'chill out' room- this translates to an adult size 'play pen' sans the bars. They have these cup holders- the like that I have never seen before- fashioned out of wood- so your pint will remain upright while you lie down and enjoy a film (for free) or a chat. There are nooks in the Brass Monkey- one in the front window, perfect for curling up with a book during the less busy days. There is a long booth in the middle of the bar perfect for catering to a birthday party of a work night's drink's out, and finally there is a room with a few scattered seats that sit in front of a Pac Man/Asteroid arcade game that has stolen many of my fifty cent pieces. By stolen, I mean, I've put in under the duress of being lured by 1980's video games. The Monkey can get extremely busy come Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights, so if you like that sort of atmosphere and the banter of Ph D students debating the relative merits of, say, the nuances of grammar in text messaging (for instance), you'll have no trouble at all. Drinks, as expected in a student pub, are reasonably nice. And service is efficient. Even without the Atari component, or the chill-out room, I'd be tempted.",

You can take of your shoes and relax and it is a great place for a lazy gathering with your friends.   The interiors are amazing in this room film posters, often with monkey-style twists (12 'brass monkeys). For some reason it reminds me of opium den pictures. People laid back getting steadily intoxicated. It also helps that the music is usually pretty awesome.  The drinks are alright although I am pretty much in love with the fact they offer cocktails. My favourite cocktail there are the Strawberry Daiquiris - very yummy.   The other excellent thing about this bar is that the room with the 'bed' also doubles as a screening room and films are shown daily at about 2pm (you often get to choose if you buy a round of drinks) You can also buy rather cheap lunches at this bar with soup, sandwiches and muffins on offer. I've personally never tried food here yet but maybe I should.   I think the only reason I can not give this place 5 stars is that is rather small. This can be a problem when it is busy. It's quite sad when you can't get some room on the giant bed.",

I saw a review on Yelp saying there was a cinema in the back. I didn't see a cinema, but while exploring the pub we found a sketchy men's bathroom which appeared to be in a converted wardrobe, and a large room full of beds/couches/something. This may in fact be the cinema room, but I couldn't tell. I also couldn't tell what the furniture was exactly because it was covered with hippies (and a few hipsters.) Neither of which I'm particularly fond of.  Quickly U-turning out of this room we found another room. Also packed, but this one definitely more hipster than hippie. In it was perhaps the pub's only saving grace - a Donkey Kong machine. However, I couldn't get near it because it would have involved climbing over a few \"vintage\"-clad youth. While i'm sure it would have been \"ironic\" I didn't want to interrupt their conversation about whatever it is you learn when you study Sociology.  So yeah. Pricey beers, nowhere to sit, shit craic. Definitely not for me.",

It's turned the pub from a nice little venue to a bland one, and if they never bring back the place's good old ways, I'll keep going to Under The Stairs instead for a drink.",

Take a pub and put a cinema in the back. Have the cinema room as a Middle Eastern Bedouin tent with Beer Holding Tables. This is brilliant.   I do like this place. Stay near the bar and read your paper. Lots of comfortable seating around.   Then take it up a notch - move to the cinema room and watch a great flick - with your friends - while relaxing on rugs - and drinking beers. Anything else we can add to this (and stay legal) - I doubt it.   Top Marks Mr Monkey",

This place is my Dream Pub, and I don't like sharing my dreams with anyone other than my overpaid psychotherapist.  There are several layers of \"cool\" that pervade this little piece of Heaven. The first thing that I observed when I entered was that everyone, patrons and staff alike, were smiling. It was like crashing a party on Planet Prozac. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves, and that is a rare commodity. That was \"found a fiver in my old trousers\" cool. Secondly, the Bar staff. Though tending an absolutely slammed bar, they went out of their way on multiple occasions to help me in my selection of draughts (which there were plenty) AND rums (which there were too many). That was \"Marlon Brando in The Wild One\" cool. Finally, there were the regulars - and I have to elaborate a bit on this particular point...A Bar or Pub, in my mind, is made or broken by the type of patronage it acquires. Having said that, I can only describe hanging with the regulars at Brass Monkey as being much akin to coming home to an extended family for a celebration; a family that you actually LIKE. THAT was \" '68 Comeback Elvis\" cool.  The music was provided by Bar staff with a masterful knowledge of Spotify, and I left with (Damn them!) a long list of new artists to acquire. The decor is Hipster, but not college freshman with a poster print of Dali  and low top Converse Hipster...More Ben Folds Five's second album Hipster. Eclectic, but not morose or elitist. I didn't eat, so I can't review the food, and why should I? Yes, they serve wonderful food, I'm sure, but your mouth should be too occupied with drinking and bantering to eat.   I love this place, and it will forever hold a special place in my heart. I met some amazing people here, and my visits to 14 Drummond Street were the highlight of my trip. I'm actually planning another trip to Edinburgh, sans sightseeing, Brass Monkey-centric. Monkey Staff, consider yourself warned!",

On the other hand, the boozy orgy bed/seating thing is a total pain in the ass to navigate around when it's busy because inevitably you will be at least a little intoxicated and you're walking on a bouncy surface covered in drunk hippies.    The bathrooms are also unisex (unless I was just too tipsy to notice a separation) and I had my face broken by a wasted guy who broke the flimsy lock on my double-door stall.  That sounds really extreme, and it wasn't, my face just met door.  It was messy.    The bar tenders are hit or miss - sometimes great and sometimes not paying attention to people wanting to give them way too much money for a drink.    This is sounding really negative, which it's not.  This just isn't really my kind of place.",

I'll elaborate by saying that the floor seems to consist of a large mattress, which makes me doze off each time I've plopped down there with friends to spend a lazy evening.  It's easy to find, just  off Southbridge, and has a very laid back atmosphere. You are bound to suffer drink casualties, as there will inevitably be difficulty in trying to consume your drink whilst lying down.. I sadly lost two irish coffees in a row on those cushions!  Movies are shown every Wednesday at 3pm as well as on request in the \"cosy\" room, which has walls coincidentally covered in vintage movie posters.",

The big Aladdin's carpeted mattress area through the back is the highlight, and probably the quirk the bar is best known for. Cushions, wee tables to rest your drink and walls splashed with bright posters all make this section pretty awesome. It also creates a pretty friendly atmosphere because it's so communal, meaning that you might actually have to look pretty closely in someone's direction and maybe even give them some banter if you're sitting next to them, which I think is cool. I reckon there should always be some random banter when you're in a bar, even if you are with a bunch of mates.  Aside from the one big comfy rug covered seat, for which you can leave your shoes on or off, there are wooden booths and tables in the rest of the bar, for those that like a more sturdy frame to their drinking and a nice supported back. There are also film screenings every day to be seen from the comfort of a mattress seat. Bring a fan at weekends though, this little room can get hot.",

On top of the great atmosphere and plentiful (cheap) beverages; the place has a cinema in the back. A cinema! All laid out with comfy cushions and low lighting and little tables which have holes in to hold your pint (a stroke of genius when drinking in the dark).   When enough people are lying about in the cinema the staff bob in and open up the Lost Ark of DVDs where you can pick pretty much anything you want, and once everyone is agreed on what to watch and has a pint the movie gets rolling free of charge, only interrupted when the staff offer up chips and replenishment of drinks.

Some utter arsehole has taken out all the beds and replaced them with proper tables. Grrrr.  Well hopefully this is just for the festival, and will resort to being one of the quirkier pubs in Edinburgh. By now everyone pretty much knows that Brass Monkey is half pub, half indie-esque cinema. There is a huge bed, with a load of mattresses squashed together and tables in the middle, fitting about 20 odd people on it. In front of this they've put up a big projector screen so you can see a really good selection of cult films. This is how all cinemas should be, chilling out with booze and food on a bed. The only downside is that there is sometimes a certain foot-ish smell lingering around.  The rest of the bar is tiny but pretty cool. The toilets are behind an old saloon style wall, where they have a list of all the available films. The bar is pretty small and cramped but they have a good range of drinks, including 2.50 cocktails. The staff are all friendly and it's overall a really cool place to drink",

At first, you are presented with the bar which serves your typical range of drinks, including some fine ale's. There are a limited number of seating areas, with many people instead leaning on the walls throughout the bar. However, when you go through in the back, you are presented with a room which is full of bed mattresses. Yes, this is the bar where you can lay back and chill. Cushions surround this back room and add to its comfort. Films are shown in here at times, obviously a great place for that.   The bar has a range of quirky decorative items on the walls and contributes to the quirkiness of the place. Go on give it a try, I dare you to try and carry a tray of drinks on top of the mattresses!",

I usually come here after a morning of classes or an exam and chill out in their 'secret' back room of mattresses and cushions.  Although sleeping is not allowed it's extremely tempting to just doze off with a pint.  The food is also great and I would definitely recommend their sandwiches which go well with the reasonably priced drinks. The front room, however, has the brilliant atmosphere I was referring to.  It's small with very few tables and so isn't cluttered.  If you're in there early you can grab a table with your mates and settle down for a heavy session in the midst of the bustling environment which the pub offers.  The problem, however, is that if can't find anywhere to sit then you're forced to stand which is fine, but it can just feel a bit cramped and pointless.   Brass Monkey is a cosy and affordable alternative to the larger and more conventional pubs in Edinburgh.  Worth a visit no matter the occassion.",

It's got character, yet it's not full of old men who are wasted by lunchtime. And even though it's not too studenty, it's still good value for money - when I was in there the other day they had half a dozen cocktails for 2.50, and pints were around that price too.  There are loads of little rooms going off the main bar area, so it's ideal if you're in a bigger group. But the one thing that this place has over all of it's rivals is their cinema room - a big screen on one wall, and the biggest wall-to-wall bed you've ever seen taking up most of the rest of the room; you can come here for their daily film screening at 3pm, or hire it out for a private screening.  If you're feeling peckish, they do pretty good food too. It's nothing fancy, mainly things like home-made soup and crusty bread or sandwiches, but it's really tasty and it's good value for money.",

    "text": "Wow, I've heard a lot about the Brass Monkey from Edinburgh folks...and finally I was able to pop in and see what the fuss was all about. It certainly lived up to expectations!   I loved the arabian style seating arrangements. - I've never been in a bar like this in my life! (Warning: Prepare to get cosey with your fellow drinkers!) The old-style cinema posters were very cool, and combined with the music, (a fusion of funk and soul) set the perfect drinking atmosphere.   I was a tad weirded out by the unisex toilets but that's probably just because it's something I've never come across and I definitely wouldn't let it put me off.   At 3.50 for a large hendricks and tonic with cucumber, the Brass Monkey was a refreshing quick stop before setting back to busking on the Fringe-filled streets of Edinburgh!",

When I moved here I fully expected to just live in the place, it could be said that the location of my first flat was chosen with The Brass Monkey taken into account (total street cred to say 'Oh, yeah, y'know the Brass Monkey? Near there...' with my folk back home) Nice, quirky barstaff, a cinema screen that will play Rocky Horror if you're there on a weekday afternoon and ask nicely, decent drink selection and friendly clientele. It still has all those things but....  Maybe I'm getting older, but The Brass Monkey doesn't appeal to me quite so much anymore. Whereas I used to walk in, run to the cushions and laze about for hours, now, I go in and look for a chair near the bar, where stinky feet aren't an issue and I definitely won't get a sore back or some drink spilled on me.   I'll leave this place to the youngsters...(Oh goodness, what has happened to me?!?)",

Cinema in the back - lots of different areas to sit - good selection of drinks - friendly atmosphere - central - relaxed vibe - cheap 'drink and food' deals.  It can get pretty busy at the weekends, you have to squeeze yourself to the bar, but that's just because it's so popular!  I often visit here for the hangover cure of all hangover cures!  And I'm willing to share the secret with you guys!  The Monkey Bloody Mary!  They put all sorts in this saviour, it hard to keep track!  It's something along the lines of vodka, port, red wine, tabasco, lea and perrins, chilli, spices, pepper and thick tomato juice... A meal in itself!  One of these will see you right I can assure you.  It's pretty spicy so will probably knock any signs of a cold for six too!   Toilets are unisex (well, the hand washing area is) it's a bit confusing but usually creates a shy giggle for the first-timers!",

Conversation was nice because the seating was somewhat close to others on the coaches and what not, but that helped strike up conversations with other people. The bathrooms were kept tidy, unlike many pubs I've been too. The people there were overall just friendly, and outgoing. The decor was great, movie posters all over of classics. This place was a hole in the wall pub, if you are up for a good beer at a great price I would highly recommend this place!",

The disinterested bartender did deign to make me a whiskey manhattan, telling me they don't do cocktails, and charging 7 for it.  Bit steep, but what could I do? I ask for wifi, get the password, and in the 90min there not once did it connect.  There goes the idea of this as a regular after school hangout.

You can't judge a book by its cover but with that hot blonde emblazoned on the side, I knew The Brass Monkey was going to be cool.  I was right - it's awesome. Movie nights, a wee room where you can cosy up, cushions in place of chairs, chilled out, a heap of old movie posters lining the wall and a decent selection of booze - this is where I'd drink more frequently if I lived in Edinburgh. The bar staff are laid back and due to the nature of the bar, there's always a good atmosphere. It seems to attract a nice crowd, which I most certainly want to be a part of. Outstanding.",

I mean, I've been to plenty of cinemas with a bar but not many bars with a cinema. Usually a screen means either sports or film clips to the song playing.   Aside from that one room though, Brass Monkey didn't ABSOLUTELY blow my mind. It's basically a student bar for seniors or the newly graduated. It's not an old man bar, it's not a sports bar, it doesn't do cocktails and it's not as sticky as your usual uni bar. It falls somewhere in-between all that, which I think is nice but doesn't make it a world-beater. It's better than A-OK. It's cool enough.",

But for now, I'm gonna describe the rest of the bar. It's small - like 5 tables and a few seats small, but thats what makes it such a great place. It's intimate and quiet, so its pretty perfect really. The Brass Monkey also does some pretty damn good soup and sandwiches, so grab some lunch here if you fancy it. At night the pub can get busy and a bit crowded, but its a great atmosphere, and I am yet to have a bad night here. Staff are friendly, if sometimes distracted by other things going on.  Now for the worst kept secret ever - there is a cinema in the back. Yep, a cinema with a giant bed/ couch thing. I can assure you, there is nothing better than kicking back with a bowl of that great soup, a sandwich and a pint with your mates and watching some classic 80's film on what is effectivly a bed. Its how all cinemas should be.",

I woke up in the night sweating (which actually is a fairly regular occurrence as I generate enough body-heat to keep the tiny family who live under my bed toasty) and I reasoned that actually I've just been going to the same places a lot recently.  However I ended up in the brass monkey on Monday evening for a quiet few pints.  I've spent time here before, a good friend used to work there, but I've never felt that comfortable. It was also the site of my most disasterous \"go for drinks actually a real date\" ever. The space seemed wrong. However, they've changed it up and it really works.  They've removed a sofa, replaced it with stools and they've put a walking bit down the middle of the big sofabed thing in the back room. This will help minimise smelly cushions!  They still have a great selection of beers, and a fantastic selection of Rum and it's reasonable for Edinburgh if a bit pricey for the UK in General.  So all in all my opinion has changed. I like them now.   Well done Brass Monkey. I shall be seeing you regularly as my new office is about 100 yards away!",

While on that topic, you may want to avoid Brass Monkey on busy nights, particularly weekends during student term time or during the festival. It really can get overly crowded.  And yes there is a cinema at the back. A huge elevated, carpet covered, mattress thingy faces a large screen on which films are played twice weekly. There is a great range of films shown, of which you can choose (as long as no one disagrees). They are mostly classics but there are some more odd ball choices, and they get new films in monthly.  Yes Brass Monkey is actually one of the few Edinburgh pubs I really would choose to go spend my afternoon/evening. They have quite a good selection of sandwiches and soup too, often with deals, making lunch at the Brass Monkey quite an appealing prospect.  Highly recommended!",

    "text": "This place's reviews greatly exceed its reality.  The seating, while cool and creative, is actually really difficult and uncomfortable for any group over a few people. The lounge/couch areas in the back room are great for two or three, but any more than that is an awkward squeeze. There are a couple of cramped tables in that room as well, which seat no more than four. In the space between the bar and the back room, there's one large table that can accommodate about ten, if you're lucky enough to snag it.  I had read in other reviews that the music in this place was kept at a moderate volume that allowed for comfortable conversation. Not even a little. I spent my whole night here screaming at the people next to me, and we still couldn't hear each other - never mind trying to talk to anyone more than 10cm from my face. If the club-esque volume is what you're looking for, then no problems, but I was seduced by some False information about this place being laid-back and good for group chat.  The 'food' offerings consist of crisps and pre-made supermarket sandwiches at the bar, and the drinks, while fine, are to-the-letter-of-law strength. You will get exactly an ounce of liquor per cocktail, and the owners will be pleased to know that no level of generosity in tipping the bar staff results in their exceeding this amount of liquor in any drink. It took me twice as many drinks as usual to start feeling any buzz.  The unisex bathroom, the hottest topic of this place short of the lounge, is fine as far as it goes, but a predictably bad idea when the place is crawling with drunk people. At least one woman I know had a man demand her immediate attention to his naked junk in there, and I had some problems with a couple of incredibly creepy, rapey guys outside having a smoke. Edinburgh is generally the least gross city I know of - I never have problems with men or have to feel unsafe here, and at this bar it happened to two of my group in one night. Mind the crowd at Brass Monkey, and take care you're not sexually assaulted in the toilet.",

Why you ask?   Is it because they play particularly decent music at a reasonable level so that you don't feel like an old biddy, and still can hear your friends (and/or people you don't particularly like but need to hear in order to figure this out)?  Why yes, yes it is.   Is it because they not only serve beer, but coffee too? And you love coffee?   Why yes, yes it is.   Is it because the bartenders happen to be people who serve you because they don't hate their jobs and/or life rather than the student pint pullers who seem to hate everything about the universe while they're working? They also smile as you walk by in the afternoon and make you want to come in for a pint later?   Um, yes, definitely.   Is it because they were playing a moderately creepy Japanese movie about a crazy woman who went revenge killing and there were cringe-worthy scenes of damage to her lover's junk and the ENTIRE bar was mesmerized?   Why yes it is.  Is it because they play Top Gun and The Big Lebowski in the same week in their mini theatre (yes! i'm in the mfing uk - i can spell it like that if i want!)?  Yes, yes it is.   Not to be hasty about it... but I think I might just fall in love with Edinburgh, and this, like an adorable nose crinkle, dimples or a facial scar may be the first thing that I fell in love with.",

    "text": "You know those places where you almost wonder if you even went to the right place?  This is one of those places for me... I trekked here with a friend on a pseudo rainy afternoon expecting magic, and it just wasn't there.  It wasn't necessarily bad, but I just had more in mind.  Now, expectations aside it was still a bit of a shocking visit... essentially down to one of the bar staff that I'm hoping was new.  I don't want to single anyone out, but it was just one thing after another with this particular gentlemen / lady... yes, I know which one he or she was, but that's just for me to know!   The first thing was no big deal, a lady down from us at the bar asked for change for whatever reason and was told by the first bartender that they weren't allowed to give change and that she would have to buy something else... a little odd given that the lady had been drinking there and as such had made multiple purchases, but a rule is a rule I thought... until the lady asked a subsequent bartender for a bag of crisps (or some type of snack) so that she could get change to which the other bartender responded \"I could just give you change if that's all you need\".  Second random occurrence was I asked if I could leave my card and start a tab rather than run separate transactions and I was told that he / she would love to, but that it would be against Scottish law... I advised that I normally do this at other bars in Edinburgh, but was told that it couldn't have been possible and that there must have been some mistake... I digressed, as I learned long ago you shouldn't argue with bartenders... they are near royalty, after all.  The third strike (this is all within 15 minutes, keep in mind) was when my friend ordered an Old Fashioned... the response, \"an old fashioned what?\"... so we just went with two unmemorable drinks (I honestly can't recall what they were, but we didn't love them) and headed to the back.  Now I'm assuming that the stars just didn't align this particular evening, because truth be told if this experience was replicated a few more times I wouldn't even give three stars... I'm giving the benefit of the doubt since others seems to have had really good experiences here.  Yes, the place is cool in the back, but the beds in bars concept loses a little bit of the novelty for me personally since Evil Eye in York has had this for as many years as I can remember... and they can rock a killer cocktail.  I'm not in a rush to get back here, but I will definitely check it out again as I don't want to leave an unjust review based on one visit... I'm wondering if your opinion on this place can have something to do with what you expect from a cocktail bar, as I had also read elsewhere this was one of the top cocktail bars in Edinburgh, which scares me a bit! (I love a good cocktail.)  I was a bit relieved that Dragonfly, despite a location dangerously close to Grassmarket, had a great in house Old Fashioned for order... Grapefruit and Maple Syrup where in it I believe, it wasn't on the menu, but I saw it recommended here on Yelp and they were happy to make it and didn't seem surprised at all that I requested it. (It may have been on a board somewhere and just escaped my notice.)  Wait, where was I?  Sorry, getting thirsty now.  Brass Monkey for now is somewhere I can definitely see myself having a good time in, given the right mindset and expectations, but not somewhere I would go for an amazing cocktail... to be continued!",

After first hearing of this wonderful, mystical pub on my first yelp night, from Steph and Allie I must say I was more than intrigued!! So naturally of course, it would only be right that they introduce me to what I must say is now one of my favourite pubs in Edinburgh.   Well. I have only ever been for beverages of the alcoholic variety, and have enjoyed it every single time. The atmosphere is great. It feels much like what pubs back on the Isle of Skye are like, friendly, welcoming, full of 'usuals' and lots of banter.... and the occasional dalmatian?? Drinks are well priced and there is a really wide selection. I can always get on board with a pub that has desperados. The staff are always friendly, the toilets freak me out a little, I nearly saw some bare bum cheek when someone decided not to close the door, so just be warned!   I will no doubt be back here several times in the future, for drinks, coffee, eats and general good times...... and I am stoked about that. Yass. What a great pub.",

You can expect to find the standard beers here with two taps that I assume they rotate or might be more. Been there just the once and will go back again. Probably make it the regular watering hole.. It's a place definitely worth visiting if you're in town.",

Tried the Balvenie double wood single malt that was so smooth.  Under $10 USD for a double shot of Single Malt?!  Unheard of!  They also have an area where they show films.    Food is limited though and they didn't have any when I visited Sunday evening- all about the spirits here!   Great vibe and decent service.",

Comfy couches, a chilled vibe and lots of wee rooms to chat away in mean you will be pretty cosy here.   We headed here for post-dinner drinks and we were all kind of merry already. The place was pretty busy for a Tuesday night but thankfully we were able to grab the L-shaped couch and gradually take over the space. I was drinking cider and I'm not sure what they had on tap as someone else ordered for me (cheers Stevie M, Belfast CM!) but it was a perfectly acceptable pint.   Overall, it's a nice pub - dark features, a good range of drinks and a mid 20s-mid 30s kind of crowd. Worth a visit if you're in the area but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to go here.",

I like the Monkey for the traditional bar area and the selection of real ales at reasonable prices; it's a good bar to sit at if you can get a stool, and the little bench window seat at the front is a haven out of the flow of traffic. It does get pretty busy at times and the bar area can get very crowded.  There's another good seating area with tables at the side, and the sofas at the back are great for relaxing in as long as you're not the one who has to get up and get the next round in, which becomes increasingly difficult as the night wears on!",

It's a fantastic amenity, which brings me back again and again. The pub itself is small, but very nice, and drinks are moderately priced. There's always a jovial atmosphere, and they have a selection of inhouse movies which can be watched if no group has booked the cinema room.  Aside: the cinema room is so comfortable, with lovely couches and cushions. Get a drink, settle down, and enjoy the movie. :)",

    "text": "Brass Monkey is definitely one of the more unique pubs in Edinburgh. First off, the couches, oh my god. They make it hard for anyone to ever want to get up and leave, especially if one's been drinking.  The drinks are also good. They're priced comparably to other pubs in the area so it's not cheap but it's not expensive either.  But really, the best part about the Brass Monkey is the movie showing every day at 3 PM. It's just such a fun way to hang out and relax with friends. I'm sure it's busier on the weekends but I've only gone during the week and every single time my friends and I got to pick the movie and it was usually just us in the room. They have a pretty large selection but some of their movies are missing. I've heard that you can also bring in your own DVD if you're pretty set on watching something they don't have in the library.  So, to summarize: 1) amazing couches, 2) decent drinks, and 3) movie day every day!",

Now I'm going out with someone domiciled in Edinburgh, it's good to actually go to good pubs.   I liked the Brass Monkey. For Edinburgh City Centre, the prices are pretty good. For a pint of Beer and a vodka and lemonade it was only 6.40. The prices are practically Glaswegian!   I liked the atmosphere too. There were plenty of places to sit, through the back, they have these massive beds you can sit on. The music was decent too.   My favourite part of the Brass Monkey was the retro arcade game. We had a game of Pac Man which, as two dyspraxics, we were obviously terrible at.",

One is like a wee back room of a traditional pub and good place to get away from the hustle and bustle of the main bar area. The other is really quite special with bed type seating and movies... well they used to show movies not been through in a while so I presume that this is still the case. The main bar is a classic Edinburgh pub with a few interesting twists here and there to the decor.   The toilets are a little strange with the ladies and gents being merged... not a negative as it seems to work just a little odd.   The staff are great here always helpful and friendly even when they are rushed off their feet. The booze selection is really good.   This is a great venue for a quick pint on the way to somewhere else or for grabing a larger table and setting up camp for the evening. Thumbs up from me.",
