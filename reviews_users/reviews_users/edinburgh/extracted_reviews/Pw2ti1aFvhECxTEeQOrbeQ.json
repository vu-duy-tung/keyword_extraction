    "text": "So your best friend of the boy variety who also happens to be an extremely charming French-speaker brings you to an awesome spot for Saturday brunch, filled with glorious accents, fresh pastries and shelves tumbling with fine wines and tasty cheeses. It reads like the opening few minutes of a romantic movie. And then the two of you start The iPhone Yelp Check-In War of the Century. It swiftly becomes a comedy.  Yep, if anything were to sum up myself and my delightful companion that day, that would be it. I shall once again hang my head and apologise that I became Duchess of Le Marche Francais in a city I don't even live in. But hey, that's just how comforting Edinburgh is! It makes you feel as if you already *are* home. We weren't sure that we followed correct protocol - picking out our pastries then taking them up to the counter to eat in, but be certain that the people who run this place are both accommodating and honest. The guy at the counter told us (well, told Chris M in French) that we were welcome to take out our brunch or eat in, and he said that it's rather more expensive to eat in. Still, because the place was so pleasant and ambient we chose to eat in anyway.  It's so relaxed that I could quite easily envisage myself bringing a book to a place like this and settling in for the morning... afternoon... heck, as long as they'll have me. I went for my favourite maple pecan plait as soon as I clocked it and it didn't disappoint. It's a hard thing to get wrong (even supermarkets do these well) but when you need a knife and fork towards the end of it because the things so fresh and gooey, you know you've landed on your feet. The Francophile himself went for a traditional breakfast of croissant, bread and hot chocolate which looked equally awesome.  Not only is this a great morning place but it's actually a French restaurant too, bursting with salads, sandwiches and main meals, and it's a shop to boot... all of which I'll be exploring if I get a chance to go back. So that's great food, lovely service, awesome atmosphere... Can it do anything wrong? Non, Franc-ly.",

Overall, we said: \"The quality of dishes on offer is really good, and the place has a relaxed and welcoming feel to it. I think it's fair to say that I'll be back.\"",

    "text": "Le Marche Francais is a regular lunchtime hang out for me these days.  The soups and salads are wonderful and the cafe's cosy / rustic atmosphere gives this place a unique charm. With cups of takeaway soup just 95p (Apr '12), it's also a very affordable place to head to at the end of the month.  I've not tried the sandwiches, deli items or cakes here yet, but I think I'd do so if there was a greater selection. I've definitely seen more tempting counter displays elsewhere in town. That said, the staff are always welcoming and it's a great place to escape to for an hour on a week day.  If you're based near Haymarket, I definitely recommend checking it out for a midweek light-bite.",

    "text": "This is a fantastic little (and it IS little) restaurant. It's French, so of course the wine will be good.   We had escargots (12 of them!) & the anti-pasta plate for starters. Followed by the beef bourguignon and trout, then a cheese plate for dessert. All very civilized and delicious.  I highly recommend this place. Give it a try should you happen to be in the area, or make a special trip - I think it's worth it.",

I could have kissed the waiter  who brought over what was effectively an orgasm in a little pot. Burnt on top, creamy business on the inside. Perfection!  The person across from me had what looked like a Goat's Cheese Salad which looked amazing. I'll be having that next time!",

    "text": "We were staying for a week in a nearby hotel while house-hunting in Edinburgh.  Le Marche Francais was practically across the street.  They were not open the first 3 days we were there (end of New Year's holiday), with no sign to indicate when they would open.  That lack of information is the only reason I'm not rating this 4 stars.  The food was wonderful and very fresh.  Oh how I love a ham baguette and this delivered, in addition to the other treats we enjoyed.    This will be a favorite stop after we move to Edinburgh next month.",

You could pair soup with a sandwich or a special entree (on that particular day it was chicken in a mustard sauce with vegetable and a side salad) and also got a coffee.  The red pepper soup was delicious!  The wait staff was very polite.  The food was simply good and affordable.  The atmosphere of the place was clean and cafe-like.  Recommended for casual, relaxed dining or coffee!",

The atmosphere is authentically French down to the staff and the folky music playing in the background.   Most recently I tried the cassoulet (a type of bean stew with meats, hailing from Toulouse) and it was superb, and came with sides of salad and a basket of baguette pieces.   Well worth a visit.",

Thursday, Friday & Saturday for evening meals at the rear of the deli. Set price menu for 2 or 3 courses, and a good wine list. Very friendly service in an authentic French cafe style. And the food was excellent.   If I weren't leaving Edinburgh, I'd be a regular customer: shame I didn't come across it earlier!   Just watch out when it's time for the bill: cash only, but there are cashpoints nearby.",

The pastries make a lovely breakfast. If you have time to sit down for lunch their set menu is very good value and the specials change regularly. Open some evenings in the week for dinner, but I advise you to check in advance if you want to eat there in the evening. One of the few places still closed all day Sunday.",
