    "text": "I used to come to Goodwill Chinese Carryout pretty frequently when I lived in Pollock Halls in my first year as it was close by and always did the business with a well priced and tasty meal.  The guy who always served us was friendly and inviting, and the food never took long to arrive. The menu has a good range of - mostly - authentic Chinese dishes, the majority of which you will have seen before.  However, they've usually got a specials option which changes weekly and offers an interesting take on classic dishes.  I'd usually go for the crispy shredded beef with fried rice and a bag of prawn crackers which would come to about 7.50 and tasted great.   Goodwill is a good quality, value for money takeaway which is well worth a look.",

    "text": "This could and should have been the world's most convenient chinese takeaway for me during my first year of uni. But unfortunately it was about as far from that description as you can get.  I don't want to be accused of making any slanderous allegations, but to put a long story short I've got ill both times I've eaten here, as have my friends. The first time, I will admit we'd had more than was healthy to drink, and so we put our illness the next day down to that, giving the Chinese takeaway the benefit of the doubt. After all, it was the Chinese takeaway that had given us hot food at 00:30 after we'd left the pub.  The second time thought, we were a lot more dubious. The food was tasty, I will admit, but it's up to you if you're willing to risk spending the next two days in bed.",

    "text": "Back when I lived in Pollock Halls in my first year at uni, Goodwill was the Chinese takeaway of choice.  It was recommended by a good friend of mine, and I was happy to partake in any food bought from here.  Contrary to what my photo may suggest, they provide meals, and not 'eals' as they sign currently says.  They provide the normal range of Chinese dishes, and also a home delivery service.  Whilst they might not be amazing in the culinary stakes, they are a convenient service that will hoover up a lot of student trade from the Newington area.  I don't normally go for Chinese as a takeaway preference, but Goodwill are a safe bet for some wholesome takeaway goodness.",

    "text": "Goodwill Chinese Carryout is a great place to order a decent Chinese meal from in Edinburgh. They are open seven days a week which is pretty ideal and stay open till midnight most nights so it is great place to pop into on your way home from a night out if you fancy a tasty meal.   They have a wide range of authentic Chinese dishes and the meals are very well priced, with main meals about 8. The food isn't the best Chinese food I have ever tasted but it does the job. The portion sizes are fairly decent and I tend to order safe and have the chili beef which is quite spicy but very tasty. Goodwill Chinese Carryout also offer a set menu which I chose once and was not disappointed.  A delivery service is available which I have used a couple of times as I live quite a walk away and if your order is over 25 they will deliver it free which is great if there is a group of people ordering together.  It is shame that is at the end of Newington Road as it is quite far away from the Uni but it is worth the walk to get there.",

    "text": "Established in 1974, Goodwill is a Chinese take away located on Edinburghs Newington road.  The food at Goodwill is always a safe bet - the menu isnt revolutionary (an indication of the business's age) but there is a large choice, and  the food is stuff you will recognise - although stay away from the 'British Dishes' section of the menu. Scary.   The food itself isnt the best I have ever tasted, but for the price, nor is it the worst and I would come back here again - if only for the friendly service and free prawn crackers.  There is a delivery service available, which is free over 25 - but this seems pointless as other takeaways in the area deliver for free. Shame really.  Goodwill is a take away showing its age, but for the price of its food it is a good little place for a spur of the moment carry out.",
