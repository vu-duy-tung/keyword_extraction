    "text": "A very nice addition to the Edinburgh breakfast scene. Very nice interior. Straight forward menu. I went for a hangover breakfast with a friend during the heat of the Fringe. Even though it was packed still felt quite comfortable inside. Opted for the full English which was served generously. They make their own baked beans which were quite dry but rest was enjoyable. Unfortunately the coffee wasn't as good as I would have expected from a new Edinburgh cafe but easy to correct. Definitely worth a visit, even if it is just for the cute waitress. All in all, a very good new addition to Old Town!",

Overall, we said: \"it's fair to say that I was rather pleased with my visit to the Edinburgh Larder. They've recently opened a bistro on Alva Street, and I've been promising to visit. This experience will certainly serve to accelerate my plans, as I can think of few places in town that serve such high quality fare, particularly at the very reasonable prices they charge. I'd recommend you pay the place a visit at your earliest convenience. There's a good chance you'll find me there, too, as now that I've finally found it, I suspect I'll be a frequent visitor.\"",

You see the goods sold here are something special - from lovingly made jams to brownies that will make your heart melt in anticipation made just perfect so you can enjoy them as much as possible.  However, as always when you find something that good and a cut above the rest there is a catch.  Unless you are buying a few items from here as a one off, say a gift or a treat, then unless you are loaded and able to spend your money as if it really did grow on trees then you won't be able to come here very often, simply because you won't be able to afford it.  That said, this shop is very good at what it does.",

The bacon was hot which helped to melt the thick slices of cheese. Generous portions provided a good ratio of roll to filling, and the sandwiches hit the spot. Excellent coffee and reasonable prices made for a great on-the-go breakfast. Lots of options for salads, sides, and other breakfast combinations as well. The scones looked incredible, but we saw them as we were leaving and didn't get a chance to try.",

And the large farm style table at the side of the joint, albeit cute, was a logistical nightmare! Moving parties of two in and out of the center seats of the table was near impossible with the overload of coats and hats and gloves that were necessary on the brisk day.

In fact, I uploaded a pic to Yelp of one of the counters and intended to caption in \"counter of yumness\" but it autocorrected to \"counter of thinness\"... Realising the counter was laden with fruits and salads, I didn't bother changing it back...  I came here for lunch with the lovely Candace B because I'd heard they were pretty good with the whole gluten free thing. I asked what the GF options were on her behalf and was amazed to sit there for no small length of time while our delightful waiter excitably rattled off all the choices. When I came to order my sandwich a little later, he remembered I'd asked and explained with kind concern that the sourdough wasn't GF, whereon I explained that I'd been asking for my companion.  The sandwich - chicken with herby mayo - was lovely, although it needed a bit of salt and our salt cellar didn't want to play. That latter bit wasn't really their fault; more likely it was the fault of people who, like me, are too timid to say \"excuse me, this salt cellar is empty\"... The sandwich also came with a gorgeous beet root and spelt salad, which was really filling. I loved it.  The staff couldn't have been more cheery and helpful, a real joy, and a great clientele there too, judging by the young man sitting by the door with a Monkey Island game on the chair beside him. \"My cat is called Guybrush, sir,\" I told him, and sailed out the door without another word, feeling awesome and well fed.",

I never had chutney before but it turns out delicious with Ham and bread. My friend ordered a salmon one and the order ordered the sandwich with halloumi - they were all satisfied with their food!

I stopped in about an hour before their closing time on a weekday -- I was a bit dismayed to see them clearing up so early but thought I could stop in and sit down for a scone & coffee for a few minutes. The Larder has two sides to it and upon entering the first one, I was told that they were closing up and not serving food anymore. I replied that I just wanted a scone and cofffe. The employee ran over to the other side of the Larder and came back with a takeout bag for my scone. So yay, I got my scone! Upon as walking out, I stopped by the other half thinking this was a cafe/restaurant situation. I went in and asked for a coffee as well as for some jam for my scone. The Barista was a complete sweetheart and buttered & jammed my scone for me ! The cappuccino she made was FANTASTIC - just the perfect amount of milk and espresso, super smooth as well. The Scone was delicious as well. It tasted homemade and was not too flour-y as some other scones are ...it had depth and was very filling. She even allowed me to sit and enjoy my afternoon scone while she closed up the place. The ambiance is that of a regular cafe, some stool seating facing the street and some table. It was clean and nice!  In all, I was so blown away by the friendly service and high quality of scone / coffee. I cannot wait to go back and try their other foods!",

As soon as we walked in, my family and I were greeted by an incredibly rude staff. To our surprise, they told us, \"we're at capacity you guys need to leave. We don't have any more food..\" We looked around the restaurant and there were clearly open tables available, but for some reason they just didn't want to seat us. There was no closed sign on the door, they never offered an apology, and they even laughed at us as they closed the door in our faces. It's very disappointing to me, in a city with such kind people, to find a group of staff that is so rude to their customers! I will never step foot in that place again, and I hope this serves as a warning to anyone who's hungry and cold in Scotland because you won't be seated at the Edinburgh Larder.",

    "text": "Stopped in for lunch after landing in Edinburgh. All their menu items use locally sourced ingredients from all over Scotland.   I ordered the Ramsey's ham and mustard sandwich with 2 side salads. The salads were fresh and tasty, but very small. The sandwich was disappointing. Literally a slice of ham, lettuce and dijon mustard on wheat bread. Approximately 8.5 ($14.20), it was incredibly expensive.   Had I stopped eating at this point, the place would have warranted 3-stars. Tops.   However, I made the decision to order a tea and a scone with clotted cream and housemade strawberry jam. BEST DECISION EVER. The scone was slightly crumbly on the outside and soft on the inside. It went wonderfully with their clotted cream, AMAZING jam and a cup of tea.   Overall, a decent place to grab lunch if you live in the UK. Tourists with horrid exchange rates find food elsewhere. However, if you choose to dine at Edinburgh Larder, save room for their scone and tea. It's wonderful!",

It was a really good breakfast that made me satisfied for a long time (which is important when you are a 21 years old backpacker).  I have to comment about the salmon since it was one of the freshest of my life. The coffee was really good too but I could get some grains at the bottom.  However, you must be patient to eat here because the place is incredibly popular and there was even a queue and I got there. So, I had to share a table with other people ( I don't mind but some people so).",

The staff completely ignored us at first and treated us horribly when they finally talked to us. We wanted to go there for breakfast and did not have a lot of time due to our schedule for the day. We even told the waitress and asked how long it would take but she just lied to us. We ordered some tea and breakfast. It took them 15 minutes for one can of tea! Meanwhile three over tables arrived AND had already recoeved their dishes. We hadn't done anything to provoke the staff, we were behavig friendly and grateful. All we did was speak to each other (not to the waitress) in another language than English. From the first second, the waitress was being mean to us. There were several very cosy tables for two persons available but she told us to take one next to the door. It was very narrow, uncomfortable and cold. She was ignoring us and our order so well that we could not even pay our tea and leave. She obviously refused to serve us even though all we wanted was our bill. Finally we stood up and walked up to her, begging to finally be able to pay for the tea and cancelling the rest of our order (breakfast).  We did not have much change and she complained about us paying with a 50 note. She was not able to change the note at first so we had to wait for other customers to pay first.  Finally, we left. Disappointed ans still hungry. I do not know how this place has so many stars. Especially as we have had so many good experiences with restaurants in Edinburgh. This was the worst place I have ever been to. But I do need to admit that the interior was very beautiful. Still, I would not go there under any circumstances ever again.",

I had the 1/2 sandwich and soup combo in which I ordered the hot smoked salmon & beetroot relish sandwich and creamy spinach and leek soup. The sandwich was made with fluffy fresh bread and the saltiness of the salmon and sweet/sour relish balanced each other nicely. The soup was lovely as well. Chockful of veggies and not too creamy like regular American soups I'm used to.  The staff was super friendly too.

We were greeted at the door by a very friendly waitress who told us to grab a table and get comfy.  The place was wedged but there was one table free by the door (luckily it was open as it was a scorcher of a day).  I love the mismatched tables and chairs it added a homely feel to the place in a way I can't describe.  One wall had shelves laden with their own produce (chutneys, jams and cordials) the other wall had a specials board and a map of Scotland showing where all of their ingredients were sourced from. As I am a coeliac I was delighted to see that they offered gluten free bread, lovely chunky slices of the stuff.  I ordered the scrambled eggs with bacon and toast and himself ordered the full breakfast.  I do see people complaining about slow service but the kitchen is teeny and you can see everything going on in it so it is to be expected that it's not going to be suprr fast.  Everything is cooked from scratch not kept on hot plates or anything like that.  The staff also made the wait enjoyable by getting all of the customers chatting almost like you were in a family kitchen at home. We did really enjoy the food here so much so that we didn't add anything once it hit the table, no salt, pepper or sauce.  This is a rare thing when you order scrambled eggs but they were so creamy and amazing they needed nothing else.  The eggs were put on top of the toast and I had to quickly rescue one slice before it got as soggy as the other one. Bottom line: the food is good but don't stop here if it's fast food you're after.",

They focus on local ingredients that are fresh and healthy. You really can't pick something bad for you I think. The dishes all sound quirky, like I had a Ham and Cheese with Chutney, which was unique but surprisingly great! My friend had a Salmon and Beetroot sandwich, and that was good. We both got the seasonal spinach and leek soup, which I REALLY enjoyed.  The waitress was really awesome. She asked us about our day, our travels, and our interests. She was a real human being haha, not scripted or anything.  Don't expect to get full (which is why I put 4 stars) and it might be expensive, but you'll be satisfied knowing you supported a good cause and ate healthy. Will be back.",

It's almost impossible to catch the attention of any server here - it's like they intentionally avert their eyes, only look down while waiting tables, and hope to avoid almost all interaction with dining guests.   Brunch for a solo diner took a bit over an hour, as another review mentioned, and most of it was spent waiting on the food to come, not on time spent enjoying the food. And closing the meal/getting the check is a whole other messy test in patience.  Everyone who sat at my communal table had various difficulties catching the attention of waitstaff, and appeared to be getting a tad angsty by the end of the meal.  My full Scottish breakfast was a pleasure and so was my chai latte, so it's unfortunate that service is so subpar and you don't feel welcomed dining here because people seem so unhappy and strained.",

We decided to sit down in the cafe. I tried a quiche with 2 side salads & my husband got the fish platter. Both were delicious.  My quiche came with some kind of Israeli couscous & a wild grain salad. They were fresh & tasty. The fish platter was very flavorful. We never tried fish pate or oatcakes but enjoyed it immensely.  The chutney was really really good. I wanted to buy a jar to bring home but no room in luggage!  Ended our lunch with a chocolate cake which was the perfect ending to our lunch. The staff was very nice.  Although I noticed people in general in Scotland are very nice!",

The decor is countryish and simple the service is friendly and accomodating and the choice of items on the menu good. I love that fact that a lot of their ingredients are locally sources from Scotland and they have a nice choice of breakfast and lunch items.  It was getting really busy shortly after we walked in and they turned away quite a few people and this was before 10am in the morning. That would suggest this place is extremely popular with locals and I can understand why.  I had the french toast for breakfast and it was excellent. I wish they served some maple syrup with it instead of the fruit compote but that wont stop me from ordering this dish again. The coffee was good and i also tasted the vegetarian Haggis which was excellent.  I would drop in here regularly if I lived in town :-))",

Comes with clotted cream and great blueberry jam.  The Scottish breakfast was great; the bread, black pudding, sausage, bacon, tomatoes, and mushrooms were excellent. The beans were a bit too vinegary.  The blueberry scotch pancakes were also excellent. Not only tasty by what you put on it, but also having a tasty batter.",

My only negative was that the fried egg was well done and more like a hard boiled fried egg. I got a flat white with breakfast and it was also delicious.  Breakfast wasn't overly expensive either. For four people it was about 45. Not a bad deal for a tasty, filling breakfast. I would definitely recommend a stop by!",

It's not a big menu, but it does things well include a great little fish plate with small salads, some crackers and copious amounts of fish served three ways. The cheese plate was actually fairly similar too and we enjoyed that as well.  The jams were also quite great and the chutney too.   The soups were the unexpected surprise. Quite fresh and creative. We got the cauliflower soup and it warmed up the late summer day.  Service was efficient and it was a cute little cafe.    A good find in the area.",

When they saw the confused look on my face after their first awkward excuse, they followed up by quickly saying that they were \"out of food\". There was no apology given and we were quickly rushed out the door. As soon as the door closed, we heard the laughter of the waitress that had rushed us out the door as well as the other patrons. If they were closed, I could understand, but there was no sign on the door. Also, it is strange that they were at capacity with no food to serve??? They could have at least offered us some coffee, or a chance to wait while the other patrons finished their meals.  Horrible experience, horrible service. I wouldn't eat here if I was starving in the streets, because I would be turned away.",

But the Edinburgh Larder isn't just a deli, its a cafe and a restaurant (with Eteaket Tea and Artisan Roast coffe). Located on Blackfriars Street (just off the Royal Mile) it is perfectly placed for tourists and workers in the east end of town, and if you find yourself nearby I definitely recommend stopping in for a freshly prepared sandwich or home made soup  so get yourself there and taste what Scotland growers and farmers have to offer! I didn't even know this place existed until a recent Qype beer (Stewarts), cheese and chutney tasting evening. The staff are knowledgeable about their stock, and matched the cheese and chutney with a Stewarts beer for a very tasty experience. The Applewood smoked cheddar was divine, and the fresh chutney, and spicy pumpkin (yes, pumpkin!) chutney, were a revelation! Now that I have discovered this wee gem, I will be back time and time again. Edinburgh Larder can be booked for private functions, and also run a number of events  Nordic dinners, foraging courses, and allotment BBQ's all of which sound delicious and interesting!",

Oh, and what is it that we'll be sampling here in particular? CHEESE?! Yes flipping please! As you will have probably read in the reviews by other event attendees, it was a tantalising set up; four cheeses with four complementing beers and condiments (predominantly chutney, but with a sneaky delicious oil thrown into the bargain). I liked EVERYTHING! Okay, to be more discerning I would say the smoked applewood cheddar won the cheese battle, the spicy pumpkin chutney tickled my condiment tastebuds and the beer that went down the most swiftly was the Edinburgh Gold. I've found myself on the Royal Mile before with visitors in tow with not a clue where to pop in for a lunchtime snack. The result has been a disappointing toastie somewhere, made out of cardboard bread and bright orange cheese and paying far too much for it. I'm glad I know this place now, as it's the first place I'll head in future with demanding and hungry guests to ensure we get some decent snap worthy of the city we are dining in. Thanks for having me, Edinburgh Larder and Qype , it was a great event.",

One needs to secure a table to enjoy the great tastes.  They have great sandwich deals, salads, soups, and authentic local/Scottish products.",

    "text": "I attended my very first Qype tasting event at The Edinburgh Larder. Cheese, Chutney and Beer (Stewarts Brewery) were the order of the day. Prior to each tasting our hosts provided information on the origins of the cheese, and the brewing of the beer. Everything served was delicious, with the standouts being the award winning Holyrood Beer and the smoked cheese. Im not much of a chutney man but the home made selections complimented the cheese perfectly. The place itself is very clean with a welcoming atmosphere. The friendly and knowledgeable staff serve fresh Scottish produce, and unusually for a cafe, loads of alcohol  definitely a good thing! Next time im in the vicinity in wont take much to tempt me in for a bite and maybe (!) a wee tipple.",

    "text": "One of the nicest, most thoughtful presents I ever received was a little paper bag with 'The Edinburgh Larder' inscribed on it, containing a variety of lovely goodies from this fantastic delicatessen.  In the bag, was a tin of Eteaket Elderflower tea, a small glass jar of Scottish honey which I assume was made for the Larder itself, and a box of rough Scottish oatcakes, which were absolutely the nicest I have ever tasted. This deli is supplied by Eteaket amongst other local suppliers, and as well as gorgeous jars of lovely sweet stuffs, they have cheeses and meats, including some more unusual things such as venison salami, which I can vouch for being tasty!   The deli adjoins a lovely wee cafe, serving up breakfasts and lunches, including sandwiches, soups and salads. As I said, the tea is supplied bt Eteaket, and the coffee by nearby Artisan Roast, which means you are getting the best of local produce, making a lunch here doubly as enjoyable.",

We were made to feel very welcome and were soon sampling the four cheeses, chutneys and beers at the same time learning a bit about them all as well as the origin of Edinburgh Larder. There was even a representative from Stewart's Brewery to tell us all about the beers. Some of the products were not to my taste but that's to be expected, although at the same time I was pleasantly surprised  I'm not a fan of goat's cheese but the Inverloch Goats Cheese was actually not bad! My favourites were the Isle of Kintyre Applewood Smoked cheese, the spicy pumpkin chutney and the Edinburgh Gold beer. I didn't even know Stewart's Brewery existed, let alone that it was in Midlothian so as well as having a great night out and meeting new friends, it was also very informative. The staff could not have made us feel any more welcome and were keen to answer any questions we had. I shall definitely be paying Edinburgh Larder another visit very soon. A very successful night, glad I'm now an official qyper and roll on the next event!",

I didn't buy the cheap deal but, after my Qype event last week where we sampled lots of cheese and wine, do I now wish I had! Lovely little place, very clean, and the owner really knew her stuff about her cheeses and chutneys. She was very friendly and explained things very clearly. The cheeses were amazing  particularly the smoked one  and the chutneys were a lovely accompaniment. There was also a chap from Stewart's brewery who had matched beers to the cheeses  what a revelation! Not one to consume beer on the whole (nice glass of dry white wine thanks) I was amazed how nice they were with the cheeses. He also really knew his stuff and the whole event was great. Will definitely be back to this little shop  as early as this Saturday in fact as my daughter is mad keen to go there for some cheese and to buy her partner some of that lovely beer. I feel it my duty to take her. Go there  it's great.",

At the Edinburgh Larder my wife and I just had coffee and asked two of the best employees if they could put together a take out meal. They set us up with the best arrangement I have ever had,  We took it all up to our wonderful holiday flat on the Royal Mile and dinned on the most wonderful tasting meal. The beet salad was spectacular (who would have ever thought that beets could taste that good) we topped off with an egg frittata and fish cakes with other wonderfully prepared cold sides. Price was so reasonable I thought they missed charging me for something.  This take away meal feed three adults, they included a chocolate treat that alone will make us return for that morsel alone.  This place is but one part of a larger Bistro that we hope to eat at soon.",

I had a delicious soup of the day cauliflower and turmeric along with a half chicken sandwich which was out of this world. My husband had a sausage roll with a salad. The coffee was outstanding.

I asked one of the staff members on what we should see in Edinburgh and she suggested Arthur Seat which we did today! I highly suggest u get there before 3pm it seems there last hour and a half is open for cake and coffee. Thank you to all of you for your kindness smile and amazing food!!

    "text": "Let me start off by saying it that The Endinburgh Larder excels in every manner a restaurant should. They are always busy it would seem and I had to have my name put down and return in 15 min to even get a table for one. I don't mind waiting at all for the right food and this wait was not only short but warranted given the food I was served. The place is very trendy in its looks and is small and light but beautiful and fashionable.   The food  I ordered the brioche on eggs with fresh squeezed orange juice. Many times places will claim to have fresh squeezed but just give you canned orange juice, this was not that. The orange juice here was premium actually fresh squeezed and only 2.5. The eggs I asked to have both bacon and berries and the staff accommodated enthusiastically. For only 9.5 I received 2 good tasting cinnamon and sugar cooked omelette like eggs bounded atop brioche breads topped with bacon, sugar, and syrup. I cant say of the syrup was real as there was not much and there was no extra syrup provided of which to pour from. If the staff does read this that would be my only quarrel, possibly including extra real syrup to pour on top would be awesome! The dish had strawberries and blueberries as well that were caramelized meaning they rested in sugar just prior and were soft and sweet! I loved the dish the presentation I found to be worthy of any food blogger.   The staff I was served by a fashionably dressed blonde gal in overalls who was honest to god sweet, enthusiastic, and accommodating. Bless her she is doing an amazing job. I would only ask that in the future she might check in to ask how the food is being taken and if it is to guest satisfaction which she fid not do to me. However still she was an amazing waitstaff that did a swell job.  This place at the time of writing is #1 on Yelp in the area for breakfast and it shows. I encourage anyone reading to go give it a try, you will not regret it.",

We went into the restaurant and realized after checking out the menu we were in their cousin restaurant/cafe next door which is more about coffee and baked goods.  The actual restaurant (as well next door) is cozy with a rustic feel & was full- we got lucky as a couple left 5 minutes after our arrival.   We started with a couple of coffees.  Impressed that they had an oat milk option & the Cappuccino with oat milk was excellent!  We ordered a couple of egg dishes.  Eggs Benedict & the second dish had a poached egg, cooked salmon & potatoes (can't remember the name).  The Eggs Benedict was amazing with perfectly poached eggs and smoked salmon!   You can taste and see the freshness and care that goes into each dish!  They have a map that shows where in Scotland their ingredients are sourced from.  Service was attentive & engaging.  Skip the hotel breakfast and get to this hidden gem for an unforgettable meal!",

Through the time we were there, the cafe filled up quickly and had a few people waiting for a table. The menu had a good selection of foods big or small. My husband and I ordered the Full Breakfast and Veggie Breakfast (10-11). When it arrived, the presentation was simple and clearly thought out.  The food was delicious. The toast was generously buttered, mushroom juicy, and plate full of flavor. The vibe of the place was lovely but low-key. My only complaint would be that you leave smelling like food. The set up is an open kitchen so you can smell everything being cooked, which is nice but it does leave food odor on you the rest of the day. Still, I would recommend this place for their unique dishes, thought out presentation and nice staff.",

This afternoon I decided to pop by the Larder and, I must admit, my expectations were high. Inside it was lovely, but nearly empty (hey, more room for me!). However, I was greated by the waitress in a very indifferent manner, I kinda felt as if I was disturbing her cleaning/packaging routine.  The service was kind of lackadasical but I didn't mind much anticipating great food. Well, that's where I was very disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the food was okay (no hairs in it, no dust on it), kind of. It just wasn't great. I had the pumpkin and goatcheese fritata which came with salad on the side. The fritata was ... well, ... bland really. There is no other word for it. The \"salad\" on the side was dressed with olive oil, that's it. No vinegar, nothing, just olive oil.  The food wasn't horrible, it was just a severe case of \"I could do this ten times better at home\". What annoyed me was that the plate looked as if someone had spent a great deal of time thinking of what would look pretty, but forgot to actually taste the food for seasoning and flavour.  All in all, I wouldn't go here again. It's pricey, and the food was bland to me. (Oh, and did I mention that my fritata was only warmed half-way through? The other side was still cold as it had just come out of the fridge!). Eek!  I'd give this a miss, or I just caught them on a really, really bad day!",

Not wanting to eat breakfast at our hotel again, I looked on yelp to find a place close to the hotel. The Edinburgh Larder was just around the corner, so off we went.  The place is small but very charming and with a nice-sized menu. For breakfast, I had the Scottish breakfast tea and scrambled eggs with smoked salmon. My husband had a bacon sandwich. Both of us were extremely pleased with the taste and quality of the food. On our way out, we picked up some honey, whiskey jam and gluten-free shortbread biscuits. The biscuits were for me, and I immediately ate one. It was definitely one of the best gluten-free cookies I've had so far, and it melted in my mouth, just like shortbread is supposed to. The honey and jam were for our parents, so I haven't tried them yet, but I'm sure they are as delicious as they look.  When we came back for lunch, I had the lamb burger. Delicious! Moist and juicy, very well seasoned. My husband also enjoyed his sandwich, but I was too busy eating my lamb to notice what he was eating.   We had good food on our trip, but the two meals we ate here were some of the best. I can't wait to return to Scotland for many reasons, but I'm definitely eating here when I do return.",

They pride themselves on local produce and the owners seemed extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic about all there products which was nice to see.

One of the best things about Edinburgh Larder is that they use local produce and take pride in sourcing all of their yummy ingredients  good skills. My favourite cheese was the St Giles Isle of Kintyre Smoked Applewood. Definitely worth a try. This was paired with a Stewart's St Giles dark beer and strangely enough even though I'm not a fan of beer (unless I'm at a festival and have no water left to clean my teeth) I loved the St Giles beer. Definitely too good to brush your teeth with, I would actually drink that instead.",

I'm not a beer or lager drinker, but I did really enjoy the pairing of them with cheese and it's something that I might try again at home. This was a really lovely shop, which I hope to be back in shortly, that has a great selection of produce. I especially enjoyed the spiced pumpkin chutney, which I may be misappropriating as having been made by me in this year's Christmas hampers!!",

This well-kept secret was like being in your friend's mom's 1980s kitchen; the kind of place you go where you know you'll be welcomed warmly by people who really care about what they're feeding you, and you'll get only the best of freshly prepared, honest-to-goodness home-cooked food. But this isn't the fatty Scottish food you might expect; what's on the menu here is largely determined by what they can get, as the food is all locally sourced from friends, family and neighbours  a refreshingly environmentally-friendly policy when most of our food is flown from around the world. Particularly recommended to fans of good cheese and homemade chutney, the Edinburgh Larder has a wide selection of both. The (squeaky!) smoked applewood from Dumfries was my favourite  I couldn't get enough!",

It's really difficult to find a compromise between quality and value and for money. Well I recommend The Edinburgh Larder, just off from the Royal Mile.  Now this \"delicatessen, cafe, gallery\" isn't cheap, but I do think it's value for money. As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, this place is known as a delicatessen, selling quality local produce but \"inspired by the continent\". It's basically got a wide selection of meats and cheeses. Whilst impressive looking, that really isn't for me, but I did appreciate the cafe. First and foremost this place struck me as a great place for vegetarians. It isn't always easy to find veggie options in a sandwich place and when you do its usually boring egg or plain cheese. The Edinburgh Larder though has a great range of creative vegetarian (and vegan) sandwiches. Actually most of the sandwiches are vegetarian. It isn't the cheapest, and expect to pay 4 or 5, but they sure taste nice. They also offer soup, salads, and cakes.  There didn't seem to be much of a gallery when I visited, but according to the staff this has yet to get up and rolling. I look forward to it!",

In the end we settled on some sausages on their wholemeal rolls with tea and a coke. The coke was an organic variety which my partner didn't enjoy but that's not the larder's fault - just letting you know there's none of the traditional coca cola in this place. My tea was fab and there was quite a few cups out of the pot.  Now on to the average part. We were the only people who ordered hot food at this point and it took between 10-15 mins for the sausages. They were good and the rolls were very high quality. Don't understand what took so long though.  The cost for 2 rolls and sausage, tea and a coke was 11. I'm afraid I didn't think it was worth this. Although the slow service didn't help. I doubt I'll be back but the food was good. Just not good enough for the money.",

I will be going back if I'm ever in Edinburgh again.",

    "text": "Love this place! I was also here for the Qype event (I daren't miss a beer tasting event!!) and we were all made to feel very welcome. We were treated to a cheese, chutney and beer session with the owner discussing the various merits of the cheeses and chutneys, together with a special guest speaker from Stewart's brewery who was talking us through the beers. I'll be honest and say that I am not a massive cheese fan and I was a little but unsure if it would go with beer. However, all fears were quickly allayed as they make an amazing combination! The larder itself has a really nice, chilled atmosphere with a kind of rustic look which I thought was a really nice look. The range of products that they store (which I believe are pretty much all locally sourced) is fantastic and the owners are really nice people. The larder must have looked pretty appeasing to all the tourists as we were interrupted various times by tourists looking to join the party!! Can't say that I am down this part of town often but along with dangerousunicorn I will be dragging my lil ass down this way more often!",

    "text": "My friend and I were staying on Blackfriars St. and, after a long day of traveling, were looking for food before exploring Edinburgh. From the outside looks of the Edinburgh Larder, it seemed like a quaint and authentic place to eat, so we decided to give it a try for late lunch/early dinner. As soon as we walked inside, each of the employees not only greeted us with a huge smile but seemed genuinely interested in where we were traveling from, giving us advice on where to visit during our time in Edinburgh. They were the epitome of hospitable and friendly to us and all the other customers, so the service was phenomenal. Nay, it was incomparable, and really set the bar high for the rest of our UK interactions.   Now, as for the food, my friend and I went straight for their cheese plates with pumpkin chutney and oatcakes. The Thistly Cross cider was also highly recommended, so we turned this late lunch/early dinner into an all-out feast. The food is sourced from all over Scotland, and I can't speak highly enough about the quality. The staff is so knowledgeable about what they're serving and how they're preparing it that, well, I wish I could eat there every day (which my friend and I did while we were in Edinburgh). Also, Thistly Cross is pretty much the most dangerously delicious adult beverage I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying, so I need to figure out where I can get my hands on it in the States.   We ended up eating there twice more during our stay, and both of those times were for breakfast. It doesn't get any better than being greeted first thing in the morning by the friendliest people in Scotland. Plus, the clotted cream and jam is always the way to go! I can't thank the Edinburgh Larder and its staff for such a memorable and enjoyable first (but definitely not last) trip to Edinburgh.   Side note to prove that the employees there are the best, love their job, and you should go there immediately if you're in Edinburgh: My friend and I were visiting in early March and the entire cafe was filled with fresh-picked daffodils. I asked who was responsible for hand picking all the flowers and, sure enough, one of the employees, Chris, had picked them all and filled the cafe with them. The Edinburgh Larder, staff, Chris and his daffodils: you all are national treasures!",

I had the chickpea curry, served with fresh sour cream and some greens, and it had my attention. You know sometimes curries hide behind their spiciness, well this was all flavor. The waiter was super cute and shy, which made him absolutely adorable.  It was packed with people waiting- for some reason they stuffed themselves inside like their need to be filled was overflowing into a filling of something else. It made the atmosphere slightly rushed if not just claustrophobic, though I support people eating, it just made my meal measurably less satisfying. However, because it is so cute, and the people were all nice, no deduction.",

Now, I never have toast with jam for some reason, so I thought why not have it  now, for a change. Two large slices of toasted granary bread arrived with a little pot of butter and a tiny cute little pot of jam, which, considering its minute proportions, was only half filled. I thought it was a bit odd. Not that I could have asked for more jam, but still.  Lovely place, lovely people and nice food. Great stop over for coffee or lunch.",

The soup options are quite nice and the bread you get with the sandwiches is really good, but the sandwich options themselves aren't that amazing.  Service was quite poor, although it was a busy place with only two people for the ~10 tables. Nevertheless, food took 15+ minutes to get there and getting any attention from the server also took a while. Overall, for a single person, it took a bit over an hour to get in and out, which I think is too long for lunchtime.  I also watched two other tables get mixed up orders (orders going to the wrong table), so it didn't feel like it was just me getting a poor experience.  Getting takeaway might be a better option as you wouldn't have to worry about the staff so much.",

My wife got the French toast and she seemed to like them.    The main reason I'm giving this place three stars is because of the service.  We waited 30 minutes to get a seat and then another hour after ordering to receive our food.  The couple next to us got tired of waiting, so they got up and left.  Breakfast shouldn't take that long to prepare.    If you don't mind slow service, then it's a good spot.",

    "text": "Strangely this was my first visit to the Edinburgh Larder, though it has been on my radar for the last five years... I popped in at midday today for a sunday brunch/lunch with some friends.  The Edinburgh larder is in a very central part of town, great for students, locals and tourists who are exploring the old town. There is not so much space inside and a relatively fast turnover between customers, making this not a great place to hang out with a book/laptop but a perfect place to enjoy breakfast or lunch with friends at a leisurely pace.   Mid-dissertation, I didn't really want a big meal which would make me go home and take a siesta. I opted for a soya cappuccino and a scone. I was advised that there was no more clotted cream but that this could be replaced with butter.  The coffee was good (artisan roast, a reliable local favourite) though there was no pretty coffee art as I have come to expect thanks to the incredible and competetive coffee scene in Edinburgh. The scone was pretty good, clearly made on the premises and not bought in from elsewhere. The jam also seemed homemade with some juicy berries intact.   One of my friend's order a cheese platter which looked amazing, complete with pickles, some homemade bread and a very tasty looking blue cheese.   Upon checking in on Yelp we got a 10% discount, bringing my coffee and scone down to just under 5, reasonable in Edinburgh. Some of the savoury dishes seem a little on the pricier side though the quality of the ingredients does seem to be reflected in this slightly higher price tag.  I will be back (if I have time before leaving this dear city) to sample one of the tempting cakes on offer.",

Seating is a bit tight as well since travelers often try to bring their luggage in as well. Had the vegetarian Scottish breakfast which was really tasty. Portions are good and, thankfully, so is the coffee. Had an espresso with my meal. The bread is heavenly. They also have a take away storefront as well if you don't want to stay in. Don't miss this great food establishment. Service was fast and efficient.",

    "text": "Yummmmmmmmmmmm.  It was a drizzly, grumbly day when my partner and I decided it was time to finally check out the Edinburgh Larder after some museum wandering. And I'm pleased to report that my findings were DELISH.  I will admit firstly that we meandered in post-breakfast, which both of us were a bit disappointed we missed out on. However, when I ordered the frittata (close enough to breakfasty, right?) and the very food of the gods was presented to me on a plate, I really couldn't complain. Seriously: for a frittata that was filled with barley, leeks, and other normally \"meh\" sounding ingredients, what I was given positively made my mouth water. Good job, guys!  My partner's soup was equally excellent, although he found the sandwich with vegetable pate (a chickpea base) just average. (Then again, he didn't dip his sandwich into the soup... mistake? Probably.)  Coffee was also good. But man. That frittata, y'all. I mean dang!",

    "text": "I've been meaning to come to Edinburgh Larder for ages, and finally stopped by the other day for some lunch. This was a great idea!  Aside from delicious food at a decent price, there are other things I'll focus on. I have become very wary of eating meat at cafes and restaurants lately as I'm concerned with animal welfare (dirty rotten hippy, I know). I asked about their pork and chicken, and they could tell me exactly which farms they got their meat from and what their practices are as far as making sure their animals are humanely treated. This put my fears to rest and I was able to enjoy a meat platter and a soup with my wife, both of which were absolutely delightful.  The coffee was serviceable - and certainly better than most eateries - but nothing to shout hurrah for in my own opinion. Then again: This is an eatery, not a coffee shop, so this is not a huge concern.  There isn't a lot of space in the Larder, and I saw at least one group waiting outside for a while until they could get a seat. It's hard to fault them for not having a bigger venue, but it could get kinda cramped.  The staff were very patient and friendly and were not at all fazed by my questions. All in all, a great lunch experience and I wouldn't hesitate to go back.",

    "text": "I stopped by here to take-away some lunch into the lovely sun, as a freshly made sandwich sounded like a winning idea. It is a wee place with a very home-like feel and the staff was really lovely. I ordered half a salmon sandwich and my friend ordered the goat cheese sandwich, both were made in timely manner and wrapped nicely for an easy carry. The bread was absolutely super fresh and light sourdough and the combination of the salmon and capers on it was delicious. They have lots of gluten free things and a range of salads and they offer soup, so lots to choose from. Their display case of cakes and salads together made it all look too wonderful and I definitely will go back for lunch and or a tasty treat!  On another note, I have been back a few times during the week around lunch time and they are always packed. It isn't worth it to wait around, as seats do not come up very quickly. The staff are lovely, but generally they can't give an accurate wait time because people mill around, so you often will wait 25-30 minutes or longer for a table, especially on the weekends. I would highly recommend take away!",
