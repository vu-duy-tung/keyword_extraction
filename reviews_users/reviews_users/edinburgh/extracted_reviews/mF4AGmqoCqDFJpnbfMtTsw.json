    "text": "Caffe Nero is already one of the better coffee chains, in my opinion, and this branch on the Royal Mile is very nice indeed. It's comfortable, and has adequate seating, even though it's a busy location. Service is prompt and friendly, and prices aren't bad either.  I popped in for a break on a busy day exploring the Royal Mile, and had a tasty hot chocolate. My friend had coffee, and enjoyed it as well. There's a nice relaxed feel about the place, and we stayed for quite a while just chatting. Recommended.",

They had a variety of coffee options and pastries as well.  An additional benefit if you are a tourist, many of the local tours will meet near here.  When we go back to Edinburgh, we will come back to Cafe Nero.",
