The cafe was fairly full with locals There are a variety of breakfast dishes on the menu - everything from toast to a full breakfast. Lunch dishes . An amazing 15 choices and all under 5! Fish, chips, peas and salad with lemon is 4.80. Salads are only 3.20! Burgers , baguettes , and desserts.   we tried chicken kiev , a cheese beef burger and an omelette, very tastey very fast and the portions are good.",

    "text": "La Dolce Vita actually looks like quite a nice place to eat in this particular street in Leith, which isn't exactly brimming with lovely caffs. It's name makes you think it might be a swanky Italian but in reality, it's just a clean cafe.  I grabbed a tuna sweetcorn baguette and a coffee (polystyrene cup) to take away because I was in a rush. The service wasn't particularly friendly but I got my baguette and coffee for under a fiver, so I was pretty happy at that. There are seats to sit inside and I clocked two hungry builders scranning an all day brekkie which looked rather tasty.  The baguette tasted a wee bitty stale but the tuna was plain, just as I had asked for and the sweetcorn was lovely and crisp. The coffee was cold and in one of those hideous cups so it was a case of two sips, and then bin.  Mediocre.",
