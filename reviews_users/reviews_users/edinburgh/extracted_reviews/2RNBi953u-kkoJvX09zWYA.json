    "text": "Haha, trust me to check in here when half-cut and on the hunt for chips to settle a beery stomach...   Dalry always bugs me because there's only the ratty Clifton at Haymarket for your chippy needs; the next one on the stretch is all the way down past Lidl. This I find odd as Dalry Road is packed to the gunnels with takeaways - just no chip shops!   So Derya is my stop-gap solution. They do good chips for 1.50 or something. Freshly made. Salt and sauce. Pleasant chaps behind the counter. Can't really go wrong to be honest. Sometimes scary blokes are hanging around outside it, but when on a chip hunt I'm prepared to brave the drunken louts.",

    "text": "Derya Kebabs is a great local business which offers tasty meals at reaosnable prices.  From the outside it looks pretty standard and there's not a inside to make you think that this place is anything special.  However, the food is surprisingly tasty and their chips in particular outstrip a lot of other places in Edinburgh. The guy who owns it is friendly, chatty and knows about everything which he offers on the menu.  I went for their special doner with chips which cost only 3. The doner meat was certainly better than average as it was succulent and tender without the usual grease which we all associate with these places.  It was good meal for what it was and I would definitely come back.",
