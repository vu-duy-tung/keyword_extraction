    "text": "Tourist review.  Loved this place! The game was on when we walked in. Although packed, patrons were friendly and made room for our large group. We had to fight for attention at the bar and our food took a while, but given the number of people in the place, it was no surprise.  Our food was a surprise. HUGE portions and excellent flavors. Are you sure this is pub food???  This is an excellent example of a modern pub. It was combined old world elements with modern technology. Old wood tables and bar stools with high def TVs and satellite provided sporting events.   The staff were friendly, but worked off their feet. They still smiled!  I'd go back in a heartbeat.",
