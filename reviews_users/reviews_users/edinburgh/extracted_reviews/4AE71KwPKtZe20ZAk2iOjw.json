    "text": "As part of our stay in Edinburgh, we had a couple of days' of take away from Mughal. Both were collection only and they were spot on with regards to timing on both occasions. Nice pacakages and good gesture of slipping in chutney and poppadoms with bulk orders.  They have a wide variety in main course and some decent starters. However, they would need to improve a little bit on quality of food prepeared so as to bring in authentic Indian taste. I do understand that this is an Indian take away in UK and should cater to British taste buds but adding a pinch of salt or turmeric won't hurt much and adds to overall favour.",

    "text": "We ordered take out butter chicken and chicken Tikka masala along with riata, paratha, naan & garlic naan. The Tikka masala was fine, but the butter chicken was not good or correct. I've eaten a lot of Indian food with traveling there twice and my sister living there over 20 years and can easily say this was the worst example I've had. The raita would be the second runner up on terrible. The yogurt was thinned down I'm sure to try and make it go further. That's just bad business. Also the paratha was overcooked and even burnt in places. Just super disappointed....",

We ordered tandoori roti, kadhai paneer, bhuna bhindi and samosas. Would highly recommend it. They do not accept credit cards so make sure you take cash.",

    "text": "When I went here for quick take away, it was fast, delicious, and just a little pricey but there was a lot of food. I was able to make two meals out of it and they threw in appetizer for free (I think?). So naturally I brought my friends here to celebrate the end of our semester. For groups, they were pretty terrible. We all ordered curry and most of us wanted rice. So they said that they would put 5 portions of curry into a big plate to share between all of us. It was definitely not 5 portions (but no way of proving it) and we did not have enough for us, and asking for more would cost us more. It ended up being pretty expensive for not enough food. Lastly 3 of my friends wanted to take away their leftovers AND THEY PUT ALL THE DIFFERENT CURRIES INTO ONE SINGLE CONTAINER BECAUSE THEY RAN OUT OF CONTAINERS! How were the three people supposed to take this one container to their respective flats??   One person just ended up taking all the curry. Pretty ridiculous if you ask me!",

    "text": "Lovely place to get an express lunch. The business lunch was only 6.95 and it includes a starter, main entree with choice of rice or nan and coffee/tea/ice cream. I had the mix starter which included a small portion of all starters combined. It included a spicy sausage, fried veggie fritter, chicken kebab and green salad. I chose the chicken Korma for my main. Creamy and mild to taste. Exactly what I expected. Finished off nicely with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Great deal for an express lunch and truly satisfying Indian cuisine.",
