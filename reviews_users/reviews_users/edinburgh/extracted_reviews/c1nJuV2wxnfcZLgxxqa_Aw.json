With a picture to colour brought by the waiter kept her occupied until our breakfast came. With was really fast. Pancakes where nice as my daughter wolfed them down and my full english breakfast was filling and delicious",

And the manager will not arrange you to the seats you want even they are empty. Stuff there are too arrogant!  Foods are just so so. This is a shit and I will not come again! !,,!,!,!",

    "text": "Our great mood was ruined by the unprofessional attitude of the waiters in this restaurant. We were ready to order and we asked them to come, they were like \" Urhhh I am quite busy right now you should wait.\" After 5 minutes waiting one of the waiters came, and he said \"you seem like you are ready to order, what do you want now?\"  We did not argue with them because we did not want to waste our time there. Overall it was an extremely unpleasant experience. Those waiters were too rude.   All in all, if you are traveling and want a good mood, Do Not Dine There! If you want to enjoy a family dinner, Do Not Dine There! If you still have a good impression with Edinburg, Do Not Dine There!",
