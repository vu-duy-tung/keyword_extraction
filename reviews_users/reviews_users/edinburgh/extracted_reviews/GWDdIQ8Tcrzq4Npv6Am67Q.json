He knew a folks names too and was chit chatting away.  Also was doing a count down to Christmas chat to apparently all customers in the shop at the same time, it was nice to see anyway.   Good choice of fresh ingredients, not bad prices too",

    "text": "If you are in this area and looking for a place to grab some lunch this is a good place to go.  This is purely and simply a place where you can get a good lunch that will fill you up without much expense on your part.  Go elsewhere and you'll get a small pie and a cookie and you'll have spent all your money without actually making any impact on your hunger.  Most of the takeaways or cafes in this immediate area don't offer good value for money, but this place is the exception.  Most of the people I've spoken to who regularly come here are very complimentary and I don't think I've ever heard a bad word about it.",

    "text": "A main stay of the neighbouring Widows workers. Also a respite for the nearby Conference attendees from cafeteria food.   Scooby's offers a hungry Edinburgh day worker all of the sustenance that they require. An array of very good morning rolls and porridge in the morning.   Lunch times offerings include fresh made sandwiches on the bread of your choice. A large variety of soups are also on offer.   Considering what you can pay for lunch in this town - especially in the nearby boutique eateries - Scooby's is pretty reasonable.",

    "text": "After forking out almost 10 for breakfast for three, at large coffee chain last week, decided I wouldn't have morning food in town again until I found somewhere cheaper? It's taken five weeks but on the way to the rail station, I found Scoobys.  Its situated across from the Conference Centre on Morrison Street, and happy to report there are not only genuinely pleasant cheery folks here, but their prices are amazing too. They have been on the go for 13 years, and the best thing is, they are open a heck earlier than most in town which also means I can have breakfast before I get home at a reasonable hour, and at a price that won't break many banknotes.  Cosy but large enough counter to wait by as your beverage is carefully constructed,  it also seems food prices approximately start around 1.50 for a filled roll, with the bread being sourced locally too. They've been waiting for me for 13 years...and I can say it was worth it, but hey don't do the same get yourself down there just for the banter.",

Good proper honest (that means ugly) food. I got porridge from here once, which they made it fresh right in front of me and didn't burn.  Yes, you can burn porridge!",
