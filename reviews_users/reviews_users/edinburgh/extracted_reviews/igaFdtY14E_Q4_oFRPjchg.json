    "text": "I popped in here for two reasons.  Firstly, it was the only shop in a mile radius that wasn't a hairdresser. Seriously, highest concentration of hairdressers in Scotland. Admittedly, I was in the area for a haircut, but after being assaulted by 35 different barbers/stylists/coiffeurs I needed to regroup, drink some coffee and just go to the cheapest.  Secondly, I'd had THE BEST coffee I'd drank since I left Australia at the other Artisan Roast store and I was keen to see if they could back it up.  Back it up they did! The girl serving told me she was new and asked me how I wanted my coffee: More bitter or more acidic. Even though I had absolutely no idea what she was talking about, I was SO excited that she asked me... I must look like I know coffee! So I shrugged, said \"black\", sat down and listened to her ask every customer that came in \"More bitter or more acidic?\"  It was imagined coffee cred! Anyway the coffee was really good, it wasn't burnt, it was a good temperature and wasn't outrageously bitter. It was a fun place to chill out and drink good coffee. I like that there isn't really a bar/counter, it's more of an open kitchen room with a 'mooch spot'. Also, there's plenty of street-poetry books/zines lying around, so if you really want to look 'hip', 'groovy' or 'happening' you can do what I did and stare at the pages of one of them for a while. So, in the words of FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper, \"Damn fine coffee\"",

I was a bit cold sitting near the door but that couldn't be helped as it was an especially cold day. There seemed to be a good selection of coffees though I only had a latte myself.",

It's made up of two little rooms, and while the quarters are a bit cramped there's plenty of room to get the job done.   Highlights typical to the UK include a little button in the wall to flush the toilet, a separate bin for toilet products, and an sleek array of mirrors. A nice blueberry blue paint pulls the simple setup together.   My only complaint is that there is not a door hook for a bag - but of course that's never a requirement for a restroom, only a plus.   As a side note to my visit, they pulled me a well balanced shot of espresso and then made me an excellent latte as well - actually it was about 8oz or the size I've come to see as a cappuccino in the States. Excellent microfoam and the perfect drinkable temp. Check out the sexi takeaway cups!",

This means that whenever I visit, I'm always no further than a 10 minute walk from my nearest flat white.  This branch is situated on the lovely streets of Bruntsfield, and my goodness it is lovely. Still maintain their \"we will not conform to a counter\" like their Broughton Street branch, you walk up to a barista tell him your poison and take a seat. On a sign above their coffee machine, they state no table service, but we were in there for over an hour, and saw just that.  Being out of the city centre, it is the perfect little place to sit and relax whilst having some of the most delicious coffees around.   My flat white was just perfect. The milk was smooth, like melted ice cream and the flavour of their house bean is citrusy and fresh whilst still being smooth. My other half opted for their guest been, which was a Guatemalan and also enjoyed his long black so much, he had two...and purchased a bag of beans to take home.   This little Bruntsfield edition of Artisan roast, is less rough and ready than older sister Broughton street, but I personally prefer it. They have somehow topped what I already thought was perfection, and I plan to visit here first on my next visit to Edinburgh.",

It was nutty and creamy but didn't bring the richness which I have come to enjoy with other coffee shops (including shops which use Artisan Roast beans).  I also found the temperature to be too low - actually, for both the coffee *and* the shop. We stayed fully wrapped in the baltic shop and I rather wished we had just gotten our drinks to go. But then my already sub-temperature drink would have gotten even colder so actually scratch that. I don't like scalded drinks and I like to be able to drink what I've ordered right away, but I don't like feeling the need to gulp said drink down before it just becomes too cool to enjoy.   For me, Artisan used to have Edinburgh's best coffee. But then we had a coffee revolution and lots of shops with excellent offerings popped up. Now Artisan is still very good but maybe not quite the king anymore.",

Or sitting in the front area and having a chat with the staff. Artisan Roast is a great remedy to the glut of Costas and Starbucks.   It is fantastic, local coffee (well, as local as coffee can get) served in a quirky setting. The set up is fairly unique (y'know, not counting the other branch), and the music is nice.  The coffee is the main thing though, isn't it? Great, great coffee. The staff can be a bit over-protective of it, but we're all over-protective of things we love. I know some people won't be pleased that they can't milk down (kinda like water down? Dya geddit?) their coffee but the staff here truly love what they do and they want you to experience the drink the way they do - which is honestly not something I think I can do. For me coffee is a tool, to them a way of life.   But it's refreshing to go somewhere where passion and love are trumping all else and it's that feeling that keeps me coming back. I only wish they opened a wee bit earlier as despite my desire for a 1pm coffee 7am is my usual passing time!",

    "text": "Having been in Edinburgh for about 7-8 months now, and been a weekly visitor before that for about 3 years,  I decided that I had to find out where my perfect latte was situated in this beautiful city I now call home. Artisan Roast was this days choice.  I've walked past AR a few times, always looking in and feeling it a little too \"hipster\" for me and by no means do I use that word as an insult but as a way of portraying how it looks. After entering there isn't much of a different story to be told, but there is much more depth.  AR is a very open plan coffee shop where you could look over the very informed brewmaster's shoulder as he prepared your beautiful cup of liquid gold if you so wished. As I entered the gent who seemed to be on his shift was sitting around with friends, chatting and laughing which was nice to see. All credit to him though, as soon as I entered this Coffee Kindom of Happiness he got straight out his seat and was very attentive to what my order was.  Today I wanted to sit in so I just plonked myself down and let the master do his magic, and magic was exactly what he produced. A sign on one of the walls that stated that they roast their beans 3 times per week made me realise that I was in very good hands, or at least my taste buds were. The latte was deliciously prepared  with a very flavoursome coffee in my cup, I'm not too sure what style of bean it was but I wasn't interested as it tasted so good. So good, in fact, I stayed for another and ended up floating back to work.",

Brewing area, cosy in the back where you can snuggle up on some semi-comfortable seats with coffee and good book. Not quite comfy enough to doze off on, but for a brief duration, it's ok.   The thing with Artisan Roast is that they are so insanely obsessed with coffee. I swear they bathe in the stuff, and fall asleep on a pillow fully of finely roasted beans. I mean, there is an art to what they do, and I feel almost that it almost ascends to a level that is unintelligible to fools like I. But I'm off to one of their tasting events, and edu-macate myself in the ways of the bean. They have passion - and it shows in what they give you to drink. As there have been frequent times where I have walked away with an entirely vile, over brewed, stewed mess of a drink, I appreciate the crazy. Here, I know that it will be good. Do you need anything more than that?",

The unfinished, me and my hipster friends put all of the money we made fixing bikes and selling our old vinyl into this place cause we needed a place to drink coffee, play scrabble and hate people lamer than us was really doing it for me. Don't let it go Artisan Roast, don't let it go.   And for the man complaining about overhearing someone else's conversation... see above. You're lamer than me for that matter too. I liked listening, and joining and getting help spelling some pretty impressive Scrabble words (\"wavering\" for one).   Whilst chatting away over a latte (super expensive but cannot bring myself to have you lose a star in ever) at 2pm on a Monday of yet ANOTHER week I didn't have to do anything, playing Scrabble on a little couch looking at a shirtless photo of the manager and/or owner this ridiculously awesome place got me thinking... \"fuck everyone else's life\".",

    "text": "I like it in here. It's open plan. They serve good coffee and nice cake things. It smells amazing, is unassuming, much like this reviewer.   I have a few issues though. I think it's a touch too small. (mainly because when I enter anywhere it becomes smaller by quantum association, I'm fairly sure this is \"Alex Physics\" so don't quote me). I've been in a few times to get a takeaway cup and felt like I was imposing on someones sitting room. I certainly got a few odd looks as I just hovered for about 5 minutes (although it felt much longer - this is Quantum physics too) . I think that I have decided to come here if I want to sit and read a book in the back, or to chat to a friend, or to learn about espresso, or at some point speak to the co-founder about the history of coffee again.  But...... I'm not sure I will be heading for a takeaway coffee any time soon.  Other than that though I love their blend, and the staff are friendly.   Roses are red,  coffee is black,  well not all coffee is,  sometimes you add milk.",

    "text": "I did not have a good experience here. Firstly, it was unclear where to order. When someone finally came to help us we asked for an espresso and a V60.  A few minutes after sitting down, my espresso appeared. I found it to be quite gritty, there were a lot of coffee grounds in it. It did not taste very strong at all, which I can't really complain about. That's just my preference, I understand other people prefer weaker coffee.  After waiting for at least half an hour, my fiance asked the barista to put his coffee in a to go cup as we were getting quite fed up. It was not particularly busy, we were unsure why it had taken so long and it seemed a little odd to bring the two coffees at different times. My fiance found the V60 a bit on the weak side, and neither of us thought it was worth the wait. It isn't one of the most pleasant of places to sit in, balancing awkwardly on a high stool, pretty much leaning on the woman behind me.  On the plus side, we are a fan of the coffee beans Artisan Roast sell to other establishments and have enjoyed drinking this elsewhere.",

    "text": "(Arguably) the best coffee in town. Artisan Roast provides coffee for many different cafes and restaurants around the city. So, coming here, is coming directly to the big cheese.   I have come here several times, and yes, I really love the coffee. But I also always takeaway from here. There aren't as many seats here as the original store on Broughton st, but there's the same clientele (hippies like coffee, apparently.)  It seems quite strange to not have a proper counter to takeaway from. I am so used to standing to wait for a takeaway that I feel strange being told to have a seat while they're preparing my drink, but maybe it's just me?  Overall though, It's a great spot and I'm glad I have this place as a morning coffee option! I come here quite frequently!   Oh, and p.s there's a punch card for this place!
