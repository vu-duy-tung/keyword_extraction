    "text": "As a tourist in a tourist district you do not expect a high end quisine, of course. All day long, I thought about enjoying fish and chips again in the evening. The waitress in 1780 warned us it would take about 30 minutes to serve us. Anyway, we were happy to have a table for four. All waiters were busy, but the drinks order came quickly and we still needed time to study the map anyway. Fish and chips are widely praised as \"fast food\", but here in 1780 this is really tasty. Happy and satisfied, my eyes wandered over the whisky bar and I spotted the gin. I asked the barman about the magic of gin. Actually, he did not really have time for lectures, but he actually got some bottles off the shelf and we should try out the differences. That was very interesting, but in the end we decided on a Glenrothes and an Auchentoshan Three Wood while the girls had some dessert or something ... Finally, we have not regretted, to have turned up here. Thanks to the team",

    "text": "This place receives one of my rare \"One Star\" reviews.  Bottom Line - Mediocre food with a staff that thinks they are doing you a favor.   I had the sausage and mashed. The 2 sausages were okay but the serving size was small. The room temperature mashed potatoes they sat on were the worst I have ever had. Seriously. They were watery and bland. I'm sure there is white school glue that tastes better. I wonder if they were Real?  The man serving us was abrupt and rushed us through the meal. We were with a group and he said he wanted us out of the restaurant before his \"real customers\" came. He was a piece of work. Not a good experience at all. Not recommended.",

Just off Prince's street, and pretty central, the staff were friendly, but I have never in my life walked in to somewhere that smelt so much of Worcestershire sauce!! Not that this is a bad thing, just a little odd! The food was good, and pretty reasonably priced, and we shared a bottle of wine, which was fairly inexpensive.   There's a good full bar, and a pretty good menu of traditional pub grub, slightly trendy tweaks, game and puds. Not a high end marvel, but decent enough to fill your belly.",

The food was pretty good.  Nothing earth shattering but was were all satisfied with our meals.  The surprise was the fish and chips.  The piece of fish was massive, almost comical.  However, my wife found it to be light and airy, even though it was wrapped in fried batter.  1780 is nothing special on the inside.  It is fairly plain - tables and chairs, a small bar and a couple of couches near the door.  They have a decent, but small beer, wine and spirits selection, too.  The service was pretty good and everyone we interacted with was friendly.   It got very busy while we were there, so don't just roll up with a massive party at 8pm and expect to walk in and be seated immediately.",

Despite the huge crowds we managed to get a seat and the staff were excellent and very efficient. We tried a local brew and it came out cold and delicious. I tried the haggis tatties and neeps and didn't have to wait long til it was on the table. I discovered how delicious haggis is especially with their whiskey sauce. The potatoes were excellent too. Wish I could say the same about the turnips. They need to mash them with butter and pepper or something different. Either way this place is worth a visit.",

The fish and chips is my favorite dish (perhaps better suited to the description my waiter gave it of \"whale and chips\"), but some of the entrees have been only okay (like the lamb rump I had a few weeks ago, which was light on flavor and in portion size). However, they've got a good selection of drinks and Scottish classics, and the dining area is a bit more spacious than many of the other restaurants on Rose St. Probably not somewhere I would actively return to, but always a fine option when we're near the area and want some straightforward comfort food.",

    "text": "Visited this pub for dinner yesterday, thankfully booked I table as when we got there is appeared that most of the tables were reserved (although they never arrived in the time we spent there).  It's a small pub with around 8/9 tables.  Most people were there for food rather than just a drink it seemed.  Interior decor has been done up within the last couple of years.  I has the usual big print trendy floral wallpaper that's popular these days, along side some of the original features.  Nice ornate glass lights over the bar and two walls covered in old framed photos.   We were shown to our table next to the door, in front of a full height - floor to ceiling window, which was good for people watching and we did have a view of the footy on  pubs TV across the street, but we did feel like we were a live advertisement for the pub for people walking by.  A table not for the shy!  I ordered the duck leg with gravy, mash and red cabbage.  It was a large portion, all very tasty and cooked well however the cabbage was barely warm, actually it was cold.  I'm uncertain that was the intension for a dish like this, so that seemed a bit odd.  House red wine was lovely thought, better than the usual vinegar you sometimes come across.  My companion ordered the Mediterranean Chicken (mozzarella and sun dried tomatoes with veg, asparagus and courgettes - no potatoes or anything though and the chicken was a bit dry too.  Good retro 60s tunes were playing for back ground music and Amy, our Aussie(?) bar tender/waitress for the evening was super friendly and happy, she really adds to the place!  So we left her a nice tip and a chocolate! :)",

The haggis came out like a solid pudding with mashed potatoes, it wasn't dry and it had good texture and taste to it.

Situated in Rose Street, 1780 is right in the centre of the city and it is just around the corner from the main shopping street in Edinburgh, Princes Street, and so it is a convenient place to reach.   The interior of the restaurant is pretty funky, with a weird selection of mirrors and rustic decor inside. This place serves the usual selection of beers, ales, wines and the standard range of spirits, and the drinks are all very competitively priced, with a large glass of the house red wine coting less than 5. The menu offers a decent selection of choice, with dishes including steaks, pies, fish and chips and, my favourite, nachos - which were really tasty!   It is really spacious inside the restaurant and there is a seating area outside too, so 1780 would be a great place to go on a warm day and sit in the sun.",
