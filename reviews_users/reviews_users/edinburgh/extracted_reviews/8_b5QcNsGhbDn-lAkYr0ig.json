    "text": "This is a nice looking pub and it has open rooms with vaulted ceilings as well as a very large outdoor patio. We had 2 adults and 2 children and came for dinner on a Monday night. It was pretty busy but not crazy. The food was good but the service was slow. To get drinks took 20 mins.   I had the ham and leek pie and I was disappointed that the pie was sinking in and warm when it arrived. My sides also were on the wrong plate (my husbands where he had Shepard's pie). We had our kids split a steak and medium well turned up Medium rare. The drinks were good and I loved the gin and cucumber cocktail that was on the summer cocktail menu.  I would go back but I probably would prefer to sit outside with kids rather than in. I would also hope for a bit better service. Overall, it was good.",

    "text": "Took over 40 minutes for appetizers on a slow to moderate evening for the main course.  Burger was dryer than my household flooring and the chips were colder than my refrigerator when it's fully iced.  I was polite and paid.  Ordered pudding for the kids and cheese for the adults.  25 minutes later they apologized about for the delay, which was the only cheesy thing about it.  Our final server was nice (thank you Pat ) that is the one and only reason for 2 stars.  Stick to Rugby matches and poor pub quizzes for your revenue - you excel at that.",

    "text": "Somewhat surprised this place hasn't been reviewed. There were a fair amount of people eating at 8:30pm. Being from the U.S., I wasn't sure what to do so I had the Boothy Burger and their house Boothy Ale. The burger was interesting. Focaccia bread, burger, veggies, cheese, and a smear of haggis.  Enjoyable.  Their ale wasn't superb, but certainly did the trick. I'm American enough I wish it was served colder.  Service was attentive. I could wind up here again easily.",

    "text": "I'm actually quite baffled there are so few reviews! This place is outstanding. Come on Sunday and enjoy the 3-course meal! The ingredients are fresh, seasonal, and local. Skip the burger if you're an American burger expert...it's good but not great. We've loved the halibut, haddock, beef Wellington, and the Sunday supper. I enjoyed the bread pudding, but the chocolate tart crust was a tad tough and lacked flavor. We loved the decor, the menu selections, and drinks, but what kept us coming back again and again was the staff. Pat, we adored having you and Andy, too! Top notch! Highly recommend!",

    "text": "Went here because of the raving reviews. Showed up and loved the indoor outdoor setup. Upon arrival we asked to sit outside to enjoy the beautiful Scotland weather, which is rare. We went inside to order our lunch; my wife's pick was the peach and heirloom tomato salad and mine was the chicken club sandwich (sliced chicken, tomatoes, bacon, egg and gem). After waiting about 30 minutes, and us forgetting that we even ordered lunch, our \"meals\" appear. We were presented with 2 dishes that weren't on the menu. My wife's peach and heirloom tomato salad came out with green apples and warm tomatoes. My club sandwich was missing the egg and the top part of the sandwich bread. The waitress said we don't have eggs or peaches. Since we already paid there was nothing else they could offer us. I find it odd that the manager/waitress when taking our order didn't advise on these key missing ingredients before ordering as common sense would serve. Either way very disappointing for a place that could have so much potential and the food quality was sub par. Feel free to try it out if you like surprises hahaha",
