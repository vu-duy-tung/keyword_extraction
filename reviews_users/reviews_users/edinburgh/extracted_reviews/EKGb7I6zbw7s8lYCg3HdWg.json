    "text": "It's a small place that packs a punch of pure fun. Half price mojitos, a dj playing the latest hits and not so latest hits (so it's practically new for the 21 years) and you have a recipe for drunken debauchery that you can tell your friends about later.  The mojitos were delectable, the dj played some questionable merengue, and the female attendee in the ladies' room was a sweetheart.   I thoroughly enjoyed dancing and watching the spectacle people made of themselves trying to impress the opposite sex.   One major downside is because so many people smoke in Scotland, we got their second smoke even from downstairs where we were. Other than that we had a blast.",

Unfortunately when I checked my account this morning I found out that your workers stole 260pound from my account .  Am going now first to report for my bank. Your workers used my card to shop online  You will hear from me soon. Let's start from here",

    "text": "Get your dancing shoes on, I am not big on the dancing these days especially since I had heels on, but I defy anyone to sit down in El Barrio .This is a small Latino Bar & Club that fills up fast particularly on Friday and Saturday. It is only 6.00 to get in that is very reasonable for clubs these days. There was a very mixed age group and the atmosphere was almost like a Carnival. Everybody was very friendly the bar staff very efficient and the prices reasonable for a club. When I was not on the dance floor I loved watching everybody else enjoying themselves. Unlike some clubs there were plenty of stools and little alcoves with comfy sofas if you needed to rest your feet. For once we did not have to got up or down stairs to go to the loo, which makes a great change. If you are looking for a good time in Edinburgh, head for El Barro Latino Bar & Club.",

    "text": "These stars need to be taken in context really. I came for the fact that they were open past 1am on a Thursday, left because I have space issues.  Now, I'm ok with dives. Dives serve a particular purpose. They are cheap, they let you in even if your friend is having a problem working out where her feet go ('on the ground' and 'one in front of the other' are often solid, yet difficult, choices) and they let you continue a night that is already a good'un and make it a great one.  El Barrio's is no exception, it was free in after all and they did let us in for which I am grateful. The bouncers were really nice people. They had banter. The drinks weren't exceptionally expensive - you're definitely not on the Cowgate anymore but haven' quite hit George Street.  However, the crush was insane. There was a lot of people, a lot. And more kept coming in. Despite the fact that I was the only girl with four guys my bum was touched (being from Dublin this doesn't shock me but it is an uncommon situation in Edinburgh) and finally, that G&T was watered down and there was no salt with my tequila.  So, let's face it, I'll end up here again whether I want to or not, as I'll choose it over the 10 entry places nearby, and it will suit my needs then as it did the other night. For that, three stars.",

    "text": "I came here wanting to dance salsa... I bought a voucher for a salsa class and club entry to go with a friend and we went last night. We arrived early for the class, as instructed, at 7:45. The place was deserted besides many staff behind the bar. Having just had dinner and drinks, we passed up cocktails on arrival but did look through the menu for later. Choose your base, such as mojito or margarita, then choose your fruity flavour to add. It didn't sound great for 7.50.  On to the salsa. We hung out for a bit waiting for more people to arrive. The salsa instructor came over and chatted us up, telling us his whole life story starting in the Dominican Republic to traveling with a dance company to coming to Edinburgh. Interesting, but I just wanted to dance! After 8, the teacher decided to start since no one else had come. We learned a few moves but really nothing that I didn't know from previous salsa classes. Luckily, part way through, an Italian tourist showed up and volunteered to be another leader so my friend and I could dance with the teacher and this guy. It was great having the chance to dance a bit and hear some salsa music, but overall I was really disappointed. I didn't learn that much salsa even though we did essentially have a private lesson. It was just a bit sketchy being there by ourselves. We left after the lesson since no one was around, thinking we would go for a drink elsewhere and then come back for more dancing layer. We never went back, though.",

    "text": "Never. Never Ever Ever Again.  Ok, so whilst sitting at a table in here, at roughly One in the Morning on a Wednesday night I turned to Luke D and said this place is so 'meh' that I don't think I would even have anything to say in a review. In hindsight..... I have plenty to say.  I ordered a vodka and Cranberry. I very rarely order vodka, I have to be in the mood. Here I should have been in the Malibu mood. It was potentially one of the worst drinks I have had. I may as well have been drinking window cleaner. It. Was. Vile.   Then there's the music. Shakira, Jennifer Lopez..... I mean really!? Mix it up, even just a little!? Then there's the atmosphere. As we were discussing, this is the place you would come if you were a girl looking to get 'sleezed on' for the night or are looking for an easy pull. Therefore, NOT my kind of place. Just, no.",

    "text": "Another on that list of shouldn't-really-like-but-can't-help-myself bars I currently have on the go.  Good for a party if you're out with a group on the ran-dan. Lively music spread out over a couple of different rooms (I have to say they do well to maximise on the limited space they have. For such a small venue, there seems to be an area for everything (bar-propping, chilling, dancing, etc.).  Crowd is decent. Girls might find the abundance of sharks skulking the floor a little off-putting, but when in a bigger group you probably wouldn't even notice.   Drinks are a little pricey, but so is every other venue in a hundred yard radius so I won't hold that against them. And if you're out on the pull and you like your latinos... well, let's just say it's not just a clever name...!  Simple bar for simple times. Drink and be merry.",
