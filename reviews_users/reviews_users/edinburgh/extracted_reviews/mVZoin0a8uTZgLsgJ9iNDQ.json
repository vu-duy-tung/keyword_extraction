    "text": "Wow....wow......have to say hands down one of the best meals I have eaten in Edinburgh.  The decor as a point 1 is incredible, rustic French barn come wine cellar look that immedietely makes you think you might be on holiday.  The wine list is also very strong, we had a very refreshing pinot grigio. Yes I know I should of had red but my dining partner (mum Mum) only likes white and we were sharing a bottle.  Onto the food, to kick us off 6 oysters BOOM! I am already a very happy birthday boy.  Jenny.L made a great point a few weeks ago that you dont see foie gras on enough menus. Well it takes pride of place here, set along side slices of rare pigeon breast and poached quince. The foie gras sits on a slice of brioche which just adds to all the flavour. An absoloutely stunning starter. Mum has the goats cheese which again was lovely, often goats cheese is quite heavy but this was light and full of flavour. The bread we were served when we arrived came in handy for plate clearing :D  Onto the mains and there was only one option for me, Saddle of Perthshire Venison, Celeriac puree, Beetroot & Carrot. The deer was rare as advised by the waiter and just so damn tender. There was also a hidden suprise on the plate, a ball of braised deer cheek was wrapped in a few kale leaves. I though it was a sprout at first and then cut into it to find this unbeleivable meaty suprise!!! My hat to the chef 3 times over!!! Witha  stunning reduction and all sorts of other flavours going on around the plate the taste was just superb!!  We were too full for derert but ordered coffees which came with a dark cocoa caramel! Home made of course and delicious.  Cant recommend this place highly enough and I will be back very soon as soon as I can get a girl to agree to go on a date with me :p!!  Jd = Happy man!!!!  P.s. actually scrap that last point I want to go back soon :)",

    "text": "4.5* really...  Set on the first floor over a number of shops on Victoria Street, the Grain Store's atmosphere with its many small rooms and authentic decoration sets it apart from the beginning. With friendly and welcoming staff, the intimate setting works very well indeed.  The food here is very good. Extremely good, in fact. I think I was spoiled a little by having eaten at Wedgwood the previous evening, which set the bar very high indeed... and between the two, I think I would still prefer Wedgwood. That said, the quality of the meal was highly impressive, with the locally-sourced ingredients being a major plus. However, given the relatively small portions -- notwithstanding the high quality, the portion control was a little too far towards \"nouveau-cuisine\" for my liking -- it's on the pricey side of expensive.  This was a very enjoyable evening, and if you want a romantic dinner with a loved one, I'm not sure anywhere else in Edinburgh can beat the combination of ambiance and great food. Purely on the basis of price and food quality though, there are certainly alternatives which give the Grain Store a run for its money.",

    "text": "The boy definitely pulled out the stops for us on date night. Suited, booted, armed with flowers and a reservation at The Grain Store. Yup, I got me a good one, I have to say.   5 stars for decor, it's cosy, dark and perfect for a candlelight dinner for two (it was by candlelight, so done deal, really). We had:   1) scallop ceviche with lime and coriander 2) poached lobster with tagliatelle and lobster bisque  followed by   3) ravioli stuffed with fennel, aubergine and artichoke. 3 of my top 10 veggies, in one parcel? Amazing! Served with winter chanterelles and spinach... just sounded delicious 4) roasted mallard with plum tarte tatin and other stuff (I dunno, I was still distracted by the ravioli)  So, what went right? Scallop ceviche was a first for me - so succulent, limey and melt in the mouth - I was nervous about trying scallops, which are a hit and miss with me at times - but The Grain Store delivered 100% on this starter. The lobster was another masterpiece, sweet tasting bisque with none of that overtly fishy flavour that some dishes can impart. The boy did note that he found the tagliatelle a little dry, though. Beautifully presented, nonetheless.   The boy also had the tarte tatin for dessert - with a 20 min wait, it was well worth it by the way it disappeared without giving me a single bite. He did allow me to try a small morsel of some fabulous vanilla ice cream though.   What went wrong? Three attempts to find a wine in stock. Unfortunate, a little annoying, but we did end up with a nice Californian chardonnay as a result.   The boy also found his main was cold on the edges. Mine was roasting hot, so suspect one had to wait for the other. Otherwise, he loved his main course - dramatic as beetroot smeared its way all over the plate - a foodie bloodbath!  Lastly, I had a panic over my main course. The first dud of the night was finding broccoli in the dish - it wasn't mentioned, it makes me throw up (literally, not a metaphor for 'I don't like it'), I don't like finding it in my meals and request it to not be when I am aware of it. But it was all through my garnish, as was beetroot and carrot (apparently it was an experiemnt). What made it worse, was biting into something that had the consistency and saltiness of bacon (turns out it was a crispy spinach which was the guilty party, hard to imagine, but True). In the romantic dim candlelight, it looked like there was ham or bacon in the dish (beetroot infused carrot, eh!). In my defence, the boy tested and agreed that it tasted like bacon. Anyhow, it was enough to ruin the enjoyment of my meal. As for the ravioli, despite the three (quite different) flavours, the ultime result was bland and disappointing. So overall, I regretted my choice of main.   Finally - the cheese platter I ordered was a little less than spectacular. Not bad... just indifferent. But the oatcakes were fantastic! For a girl who avoided oat cakes like the plague until this year, I've come to appreciate a good, home made oatcake. Three types, with the middle one tasting like a savoury hob nob. That may not seem like the highest of compliments, but for me it is.   Finally, before you cast The Grain Store aside, think on this: despite previous reviews noting poor service, we didn't have that experience. Our servers were cordial and ticked all the boxes. They placed us away from the family with a young kid to give us privacy & peace in our very own dining area, and chatted away (and also recommended other places to visit). When I complained about my main potentially being soured by meat, not only did they doublecheck with the kitchen, but came back with an explanation as well as noted that they had provided feedback to the chef in regards to ensuring no meat like flavours are imparted in a veggie dish, so this would be noted as part of the meal, also offering to replace if I so wanted. Prompt with each part of the meal as well as the cheque, I found it exemplary.   As a date night, as I mentioned at the start of my review, it was a fantastic choice - if we found ourselves here again, I wouldn't be sad. I'd just be a little more judicious with my menu choices.",

Poor service, bad wine, most of the items on the menu were not available, and worse of all, serving gluten to someone with celiac disease. Much better options for dining in Edinburgh.",

    "text": "A favourite restaurant of mine. It's hidden away from the bustle of Victoria Street on the first floor - I'd passed it plenty of times before even realising it was there. The interior is rustic, traditional and comfortable, and suits the type of cuisine perfectly.   The Grain Store serves fine Scottish food - ok, so the portions are a little on the small side if you're more of a 'hearty' diner, but deliciously modern and aesthetically beautiful.   I've eaten in here both for lunch and for dinner. Lunch prices are much more reasonable, however for an evening meal, it's worth the indulgencethe restaurant is candlelit and moody and has a lovely ambience in the evening.   Vegetarian options are rather limited. In fact, once when I'd eaten in here there were no vegetarian options for a starter at all. But the service staff were accommodating and ensured the chef was able to come up with something suitable for me. So don't let the lack of vegetarian options put you off.   I've also eaten in here in a larger sized party, and the service was equally as good.   The Grain Store is a small restaurant, so booking is essential, but it's well worth a look in.",

We had light and fresh oysters, scallops with caviar, halibut with garlic puree, and partridge. The interior was very cozy and enjoyable. The one downside was that the service was certainly lacking. Granted, despite trying to time our reservation around the seating of a large party, we somehow managed to still make it EXACTLY when they decided to sit. Still, the service team seemed completely overwhelmed at balancing the table the had with this party. They still were friendly but utterly confused. I'd still go back, but I probably wouldnt take someone I particularly wanted to impress.",

    "text": "This is a fabulous restaurant. It's been on my list of places I'd like to go for almost as long as I've been in Edinburgh and now I feel vindicated!   I went there for lunch yesterday. We ate from the set lunch menu which offers two courses for 10 and 3 for an incredibly reasonable 13.50.   So for my 13.50, I enjoyed a very fine smoked salmon and homemade horseradish sauce, followed by pheasant with red cabbage and celariac puree and followed again by white and dark chocolate mousse accompanied by a very nice orange muscat.   The wine list is impressive though not the cheapest you could ever hope to buy with prices starting at about 16 a bottle. But this is one of those restaurants where you almost don't mind parting with the money as the overall atmosphere is so charming.   We were there day time so the grey Sunday afternoon drifted in through the sashed windows but evening time - as the other reviewers observe - apparently sees the place bedecked with candles making it perfect for a romantic encounter.   The maitre d' was a delightful man. I'm not sure if he's a permanent fixture but he should be.   This is undoubtedly one of Edinburgh's hidden gems. And the very reasonably priced set menu makes it accessible to those with a less robust bank balance. Do try it for yourselves.",

The lobster bisque appetizer was good with large pieces of lobster. However when ordering lobster bisque I expected soup not a drizzling of sauce.  The entree was ox tail with monkfish on top. The ox tail was so salty....again perhaps due to a different palate and preferences. Therefore, the rating of three stars. It was expensive..sorry won't be back.",

Amazing Food, Fabulous Service and a wonderful-old world location. We ate in the Clock room. It was going back in time... no pun intended. Stone walls with artwork. As it turns out the Manager, Paul, has a few of his photographs in the restaurant.  We were seated quickly, offered wine, water and fresh bread. Best bread! One was Rosemary, the other was herbs/seeds. My first trip to the Grain Store was for dinner with a party of four. On the return my father and I had lunch. Then walked over to the Castle to be tourists.  My starter was the fresh oysters. Chilled and tasty. My father had the Gazpacho with basil oil. He almost licked the glass jar it was served in. For lunch I had a Wild mushroom Risotto and Dad enjoyed the Coley fish dish. YUM! Dessert too. I was not in the mood for sweet as I was having a crisp white wine. Paul asked the Chef to prepare a cheese plate. Perfect! Dad had the Panna Cotta and again I had to stop him from licking the plate. LOL. Can't wait for my next trip to Edinburgh.

We ordered a red wine from the Languedoc region in France and it was very good value for money.  My venison was tender, and mild in flavour with a delicious sauce that I wish I could duplicate at home. I am not usually a big fan of puddings but ours were quite tasty and not overly sweet.  My only suggestion is that I wish they offered Sides on the menu so that we could take more advantage of their wonderful produce. Perhaps next time I will ask, why didnt I think of that last eveninig? :-)",

    "text": "Firstly, there is no disputing that the food is good. A great and wide variety of game, seafood, poultry and red meat, beautifully cooked and presented. On the night my wife and I went totally seafood, enjoying pan fried scallops with crispy bacon, poached lobster with tagliatelle and lobster bisque, crispy skinned halibut with spinach and broccoli and sea bass with a creamy mussel sauce...utterly delicious and in it's own right worthy of 5 stars.   However...  We are disappointed with the service.   When you're experiencing such beautifully prepared and cooked meals, there is an expectation that the front of house experience will not be anything less in comparison, therefore ensuring the perfect dining experience. The staff at The Grainstore were very friendly, no doubt, but their attention to detail is greatly lacking and perhaps a sign that the front of house staff are on the whole very inexperienced.   Firstly, after ordering the wine, we were presented with the wrong bottle. Secondly, both my wife and I had to repeat our selections when orders were taken due to the French waitress having a poor grasp of English. Thirdly, again due to English comprehension issues, my requested flat white came out as an espresso. Lastly, on presentation of the bill we had to wait 25 mins before one of the staff came over to process our card payment...and this was with us trying to get their attention for the last 10 minutes of that 25.  When you're paying well over 3 bills for a dinner for 2 (and more than happy to do so), there is an expectation that the experience, all of it, will be married and aligned. As said, the meals themselves are worthy of 5 stars (and have received ad much from other reviewers), but the service I'm afraid a lowly 1.",

    "text": "Move over the Witchery, this place is definitely one of the best restaurants in Edinburgh. And unlike the Witchery, it a) actually deserves that title and b) hasn't awarded it to itself.  I'd walked past it for years, before I ever worked out where it was - the only thing you see from Victoria Street is a tiny little painted sign on the wall and a small menu by the door. That sums this place up all over - it's amazing without needing to shout about it. It's always busy because of word-of-mouth, but it's never absolutely packed like the 'it' restaurants where people book a table just to be able to say they've eaten there.  The food is loosely-speaking Scottish and French, but it's a bit quirkier than the sorts of dishes you'd expect to find - they serve things like Hare, Wild Boar and Ox Tongue.   I have to say, their evening menu is more than a little bit pricey. Main courses are 15-25 each, so by the time you have 3 courses and factor in wine and coffee you're looking at quite a hefty bill. The lunch menu, on the other hand, is an absolute steal. No matter what people say, you've got to love the Recession for all the high quality yet affordable set-price menus that the restaurants have had to introduce as a result. The Grain Store is no exception - you can get 3 courses for 14.95, or if you're not feeling that peckish then 2 courses are only 12.95, and the dishes are pretty much exactly the same things you can get from their a la carte selection.  I'm going back here for dinner in a few weeks, and I can't wait.",

    "text": "D splashed out for a fancy dinner here for our last celebratory occasion and the food did not disappoint. However the service wasn't QUITE up to par for the price point. I attribute this to the fact that we were sat in the room furthest away from the kitchen, but still...  we were sat at a small table in a somewhat awkward corner under the GIANT grandfather clock (which I LOVE!), tho I was next to the radiator, so not too many complaints there! It was right next to the door which led to the loos, so we got quite a lot of foot traffic during our meal which I didn't really like.   I was rather gutted they were out of scallops as the scallops with pork belly and apple sauce sounds divine! I settled for a lobster cocktail instead which was delightfully paired with a tomato confit and delectable, although the gem lettuce left a slightly bitter aftertaste. D had foie, duck & figs which was delicious.  We both had the venison and there were two very very clean plates at the end. My chocolate fondant pudding was rich and decadent and mmmmmmmmm...  I probably would have licked the plate if there hadn't been anyone else in the room! D's bakewell tart wasn't half bad either. ; )  If it wasn't for the slightly lacking service (which really wasn't THAT lacking compared to anywhere else), I'm just being finnicky because when I pay a certain price point for my dinner, I expect a certain level of service and I felt The Grain Store fell down a bit on it. Would I let it stop me visiting again? Certainly not! Especially with a 3 course lunch menu at 15.95 or the likes...  Will def have to stop in for lunch one of these days!  Splash out for the food, it's worth it!",

    "text": "Three stars from me due to value for money, among other things...  A few weeks ago eleven of us went for a three course meal with several bottles of wine, for about 500 at The Shore.  A few days later five of us came to the grain store and two courses with one bottle of wine was somewhere in the 300 range.    The restaurant itself is great.  It's a bit funky and has a really great old feel to it.  The staff were lovely, though for the quality of the restaurant I felt they should have been trained to a higher level.  Our waitress became confused about how and when we wanted our wine, and forgot some of our coffee orders at the end of the meal.  The food itself was gorgeous, though admittedly not as hot as I would have liked it.  Serving sizes were small, but every bite was so rich that we were satisfied.    I think that the desserts were really the highlight of the meal, they were rich and luscious (though the ice cream that mine came with had something inedible in it... I think it may have actually been vanilla pod?).  I was fortunate enough to try everyone's desserts which were all of the same quality (minus the pod).  The coffees were fine, though again for the quality of the restaurant they need to learn how to froth milk correctly... my dad's cappuccino was really just a milky coffee topped with dry foam.    So... looking back I actually had a pretty \"meh\" experience here.  If it had been more reasonably priced I would have overlooked the coffee, food temperature and vanilla pod but when you pay that much you expect to not just get fine food, you expect to have a complete fine dining experience.  I wouldn't come back.  Not due to being put off by the inconsistencies but simply because I feel there are other restaurants in Edinburgh which offer food of similar quality (minus service inconsistencies) for a much more reasonable price.",

The over all feeling is of intimacy and seclusion - but in a good way.  The food itself is magnificent - and most certainly proud to be Scottish. The staff were bursting to tell us which of the many meals were locally sourced and how fresh they were which was good to hear. The food was beautifully presented and more suprisingly standard glasses of wine are larger than I expected. Bonus. The menu is regularly changed and updated - so it is of course an excuse to go back time and time again, which I most certainly will.  There are however, a few let downs with The Grain Store. Firstly, it was on the expensive side despite it being pointed out to me several times that the food was good quality and very tasty. Secondly, I had the distinct impression that the staff were ungreatful for our custom - an off putting notion.  Over all - the Grain Store has a magnificent atmosphere, great food, beautiful location and generally very nice - but it is let down by the prices and a ever so slightly rude staff.",

Inside, it is tastefully decorated in a rustic style and the ambience is intimate and romantic. The menu aims to showcase Scottish produce (local wherever possible) and it does this superbly, everything is freshly prepared and served up to you simply and stylishly. The menu changes regularly, when I was last there I had mackerel done three ways (smoked, pickled and cured with capers and lemon) - a classically Scottish dish with a twist, done very very well.   The staff are knowledgeable, professional and friendly - the wine that was recommended went well with my meal and the price of the bottle wasn't too much of a shock.  The Grain Store represents all that is good with Scottish cuisine today and obviously this comes at a price, but it is a price worth paying.",

    "text": "Belated review, but a thousand stars if I could! Tucked away in a lovely, original stone building, The Grain offers a warm and romantic ambiance and fares emphasizing the quality of ingredients.  My friend and I visited for dinner during our trip and had the great luck of being seated by the window to enjoy the slow settling of dusk. I think the owner (Paul?) was running the floor and was more than thorough in explaining the menu, recommending his favorites, and was all around accommodating. We settled on sharing an appetizer of scallops, the halibut, and venison per his recommendations. All of the food we had were perfectly cooked and suited our tastes, but the venison stood out in particular.   One of my friend's quirks is that she doesn't eat anything raw or undercooked, so we asked for the venison to be cooked on the medium side of medium rare. This way, I can have the pink inside of the meat while my friend can have the well done outside. When we explained this dynamic, they were amused and promised to try their best. To my complete and utter shock, the entree that arrived had two different portions of venison - one that was well done, the other a perfect pink. They had gone the extra mile of cooking the entree two different ways so we both got exactly what we preferred!!! If that's not the most heartwarming, thoughtful service you've ever heard then you can just shove it because even now, months after the fact, I still smile thinking about this.   All in all, I spent way too much money and ate way too many delicious meal in Edinburgh (to my great surprise), but this meal was one of my favorites because not only was the food excellent, the service really blew me away. Truly a memorable experience all around - bravo!",

The location is on a touristy street in Old Town, and the interior is well-appointed and intimate.   The service is prompt, professional, and helpful. The wine was very good.   So what's the problem? The food. It's not very good. The lobster was tough and chewy - I'm not even sure how they did it. My entree was ok, although the portion seemed identical to the size of the appetizer. They charge you an extra 1 if you want bread, so I figured it must be something special; nope, it's 3 small slices of bland bread with over-baked crust.   The prices are too high to justify this low-quality cooking. I'm bumping it up to 3 stars because everything else was good, but in general, is skip this place and try Steak & Mussels down the street.",

It came in a mini jar looking more like a pretty sauce.  With it, a few lumps of sun dried tomatoes, a kick of raw tomato puree and strong tang.  Reminiscent of the vinegary kick in hot sauce, it was not so remarkable.    My second appetiser was the smoked salmon with fennel.  Beautiful for both the eyes and palate, it was conjured up flawlessly.  Its every part was delicate & worked.    Three of us got the Duck confit and I have to say it was incredibly disappointing.  It was as if the chef forgot he already seasoned the meat and gave it another dose..maybe a triple.  It really ruined the dish which resulted in my nit picking at the beans on the side. The consensus at our table was that we should have gone for something else.  The server approached us too late and we couldn't mention the state of our dish for it to be worth the wait.  After a break into our first few bites, we pecked here and there and left it to be.  We were ready to leave.  I was told risotto was very good, but then risotto is usually pretty good and hard to really mess up.  I have to be honest and say I'm very disappointed with what we experienced.  At 5quid for half a pint of your average beer, you'd expect the food to be something worth it.  But the mains went so wrong its hard to be forgiving.  Three for the good first dish, charm and friendly owner.  Hope I can muster enough courage to give it another go.",

    "text": "The Grain Store has to be one of my all time favourite Edinburgh restaurants.  Sometimes I wish I could pick it up and move it to Glasgow so I could go more often!  I discovered this little gem nestled on Victoria Street a few years ago when I went for dinner with my family.  At this point I was still a bit of a fussy eater, so I ordered the chicken dish and instantly regretted it when I saw the beautiful plates being placed around me.  I tried venison for the first time that night, and it is now one of my favourite meats because of the beautiful plate of venison my mum ordered.  She had to fight to keep her plate most of the evening!  From then on, it became a regular go-to restaurant when I was through in Edinburgh visiting friends or family, especially given their extremely good value lunch menu.  In the evening, most main courses are priced between 18 and 25, which is a lot, so the fact that they offer a lunch menu where you can get three courses for 15 is, to me, insane value for money.  On my most recent visit, I went with my mum and my gran for Mothers Day lunch, where we each had a starter and a main course for 12.50 each.  For starter I ordered Stornaway Black Pudding with Apple Puree, which I have had their before, and it was stunning.  The black pudding was crumbly, perfectly complimented with the apple.  For main I chose the Duck Confit with Haricot Bean Cassoulet.  Again, this was fab and really filling.  The duck skin was crisp, the meat tender and flavoursome, and the cassoulet really rich and warming.  We were also given some lovely freshly baked bread which had a perfectly crunchy crust, with a soft, yummy dough.  The manager of the restaurant is incredibly friendly and loves to check in making sure you have everything you need and that you are enjoying your meal, so the service is always impeccable.  On this occasion, for three people, our bill came to 66 - two courses each and a bottle of red wine.  The food is such a high quality and the staff are so friendly and attentive that The Grain Store is always a big hit with me, and I'll continue raving about it to anyone visiting Edinburgh!",

I ordered the Black pudding started, and Pork Belly main, and both were delicious. Service was really good as well.   The place was very busy at lunch (mainly with senior citizens that day). However, it did seem like most of the people were locals.   The setting of the restaurant was quite nice as well.   I'd definitely recommend this place to others.",

We watched more than a few waiters polishing glasses as our wine glasses were empty, the bottle empty and finally had to get up to ask to get another.   The food was good.  Beautifully presented.  We all enjoyed our meals, but would probably have enjoyed more if we had had better service.",

    "text": "Really impressive place - not that my sights were not set high but I was thinking it would be a very good meal and not something wherein I would walk away saying things like \"that was the best venison I've ever eaten\" (side note - I've eaten a lot of venison).  They were creative with the meals but not out of control or going too far off the reservation. I had the lobster tagliatelle to start which was a deal and a half given that the pasta was home made and the quality of the lobster and caviar was so high. My wife had a starter I can't remember followed by the pork and I the venison. All of it just crushed expectations.   Further the servers were quite on top of things and we found them quite stellar given that it seemed as though only two people were doing all the order taking, plates clearing and serving. They outdid themselves.  The one semi-non-highlight was the apple tart tatin. It was good but just not super 'knock your socks off' good and we waited 15 mins for it which kind of killed the thunder. But still a 5 star place.  Can't highly recommend enough.",

    "text": "This was a great spot for lunch! Last time I was in Edinburgh my waitress at another restaurant had recommended this place as one of her favorite places to go as a local for a nice meal. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was just a block away from my hotel.  We did the 2 courses for 12.50 and it was an amazing offer. We had baked oysters to start that were okay. You could still taste the freshness of the oyster, which was nice. I started out with the gazpacho, which was very garlicky but still quite tasty. It was a bit more acidic than I like it, but super fresh and light. I went with the risotto dish while my colleagues went with the trout and the pork belly. Everyone was quite happy! And seriously, for the price it can't get any better. You could taste the quality and freshness in everything on the plate.   Secondly, you really can't beat the atmosphere. It was quaint and charming and a great view of the city from the windows.",

    "text": "It has taken me a while to visit The Grain Store but it was well worth the wait. Boasting the best of Scottish produce, they offer a two course lunch for a generous 12.50 (or 15 for three courses).  To start I had oysters which came with shallot vinegar.  Not a lot you can say cooking wise but they were plump and fresh as a daisy and the vinegar was a classic partner to them.  Sarah went for Stornaway black pudding with apple, which came well presented and  was a good sized starter portion.  The variations of apple complimented the wonderful black pudding and we were really enjoying the open brick surroundings.  For main i had duck confit with celeriac and spinach.  The skin was nice and crisp while the meat was still moist.  It was well seasoned and the celeriac puree was silky and velvety and brought an earthyness to the plate. The spinach was superbly executed and the rich sauce tied this wonderful dish all together perfectly.  I was tempted by the pork belly with chestnuts and kale and was glad Sarah ordered it so i could steal a taste! The pork was expertly cooked and seasoned and kale was soft but still had a slight bite to it.  I'd have been equally as happy to devour that as I was with my duck dish.  I really love the interior of the restaurant and the service was excellent throughout.   At 12.50, this is superb value for money and certainly should not be missed.",
