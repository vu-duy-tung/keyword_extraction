The host/owner made a solid first impressions and then stood back and let his star waitress work her magic.  I loved the homemade bread with both white yoghurt sauces and the lamb tinkers were fantastic.",

Started with mixed olives and ordered the Izagara Kofte mixed platter for two and it was amazing. Beyond that, this is a romantic spot to end the night, the interior and ambiance is beautiful.",
