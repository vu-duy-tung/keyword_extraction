The staff are friendly and polite and often have a lot to deal with with all the school children piling through the door, some of which can be a bit rude to say the least.   The food it's self is well prepared with generoud helping and well filled rolls and sarnies prepared right in front of you, it is reasonably priced and service is quick.   have been in there several times in the last five years and have to say I have never been diappointed.",

    "text": "Now you may ask me what is so special about this particular Baguette Express? Everyone knows Baguette Express is basically a sandwich shop offering baguettes (duh), baked potatoes, salads and sandwiches with a wide range of fillings and an affordable price. Nothing too exciting here right?   Well this particular Baguette Express, which happens to be my local stocks MOUNTAIN DEW! Yes that sugary goodness that comes from what can only be the mountains of heaven is stocked here! I hate to say it, but a part of me has been completed by that discovery. At 1.30 a can you can enjoy the sweet nectar that you once only enjoyed in America (or other foreign countries which stock it). On close inspection of the can it seems it is imported from Poland. Genius, just genius. Now if they would start to stock Cheetos and Lays I could sit quite happily and get fat.  Oh and you could pick up a baguette too, I guess they are pretty good. But Mountain Dew!!!",
