Both of them was not up to par.  The rib eye was fibery and chewy .   The Fillet was also coming apart in shreds.   Maybe they just fed us the lowest quality they ever had.  Truly dissatisfied.",

    "text": "The Chop House is a fantastic steak house. I'll start by saying that the staff were great. They were able to answer all of our questions regarding the different steaks. My mother decided she wanted the sharing bone in rib for herself (the lady can eat) and the waitress found this hilarious. We got 2 bottles of wine for the table. The waitress poured one of the bottles into a carafe which was quite nice actually.  It's got a good buzz about it. Very busy and lots of people chatting and enjoying their meals. One of it's cool features is the dry ageing cabinets which display the meat.   For the starter I had the crispy squid which I'll say wasn't really crispy. It was sort of like a squidgy onion ring? Still, they tasted good. I also got to try the mussels and the oysters which were tasty. For the steak, I decided to go for the sirloin which is actually unlike me. I decided to be different. I got it medium-rare and it tasted so good. I chose the bone marrow gravy which was very rich tasting. The menu actually had a fair few number of bone marrow dishes which is great because I don't see it a lot. I chose 2 sides - macaroni cheese and dripping chips. I could've probably just had those 2 as a meal on it's own as they were so delicious.   There was no dessert as there was birthday cake! My lovely friend brought a cake which was brought out at the end of the meal. The waitress provided plates, cutlery and napkins for everyone.   I can't really fault this restaurant at all. Great wine, food and staff. I will be back here if I'm in Edinburgh looking for steak.",

    "text": "If I want to go for steak in Edinburgh, Chop House is where I'd go.   There is a lot of great places to eat steak in the city and I've not tried them all, but for me Chop House is the perfect blend of a chilled out ambiance, stylish venue, and top quality steak.   I'd had a fantastic and memorable meal here the first week it opened, so coming again recently with a group of friends I had high expectations. Thankfully it met them.   We started with fun cocktails, including a martini infused with bone marrow. We also had bread with bone marrow butter - if you're not into meat, this probably isn't the place for you. We shared a couple of chilli squid starters between the 4 of us, which were great and had a decent kick to them.   We opted for one of the sharing cuts, a bone-in rib, along with some sides. The meat was around 70 for 900g (on the cheaper end of their market cuts) but happily fed 4 of us. It also came with a selection of 6 different sauces in very small saucepans. Sides aren't huge but are decent, if not spectacular. Skinny fries are pretty much what you'd expect. The kimchi was a nice but very spicy addition though.  The only caveat to this review - this is a great place for steak but not a great place for brunch. I have been here for brunch and been somewhat underwhelmed. There are cheaper options that are probably a better option.  Chop House isn't the cheapest, but it does great steak with a nice ambiance.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try Chop House since I first noticed it during one of my early morning runs down to the shore. Thankfully after many more runs passing the restaurant I finally made it there for dinner!   We went for a 6pm reservation (that I booked a month in advance so definitely book!) and were seated at a cost table in the corner. I was a bit surprised to see how small the dining area actually was which explains why they are always booked up! I'm not sure if it's the design of the restaurant at fault or we were just in on a really noisy night but it was quite loud. So maybe not the best for a cosy romantic date if that's the regular noise level.   The menu is pretty concise focusing on their steak offerings but I did note a few other mains if steak isn't your thing. We went for some pre dinner cocktails- I had the sweet street swizzle which was super tasty and I'd recommend it! For starters we shared prawn tempura and seared scallops, I liked that you could order these in numbers so you didn't get full from a big starter before your meal. We also had the granary bread with bone marrow butter that was really tasty and fresh. The prawns and scallops were also really good with the scallops being seared in a really tasty garlic butter.   For mains I had the sirloin steak and my boyfriend had the rib eye. We shared a side of macaroni cheese, grilled asparagus, and mashed potatoes with gravy.  The steaks were cooked really well and my spicy chimmichurri sauce worked really perfectly with it although my boyfriends blue cheese sauce was also seriously good.  The macaroni cheese was super cheesy and thankfully not soggy which I hate. The mash and asparagus were both really nice but I may try different sides next time.  For pudding I squeezed in a scoop of marshmallow ice cream that was good but I probably should have gone for the salted caramel....  Overall though I was really impressed with Chop House.  The food was fresh, well cooked, and made a really enjoyable meal. A star off for the super loud atmosphere and also wrong charges on our bill which I had to ask the waitress to correct. That aside this place was worth the wait and the money! Looking forward to going back already!",

We had scallops and crab claws to start and both very nice. But it was the sirloin steak for me that was stunning. Without doubt best steak every had. Looked like those you see in magazine pictures and tasted every bit as good as it looked. Even the mushrooms tasted better than most. Wife had lobster and this was delicious too.   A great meal and really cool decor. Blues music playing in the background was right up my street too. Would highly recommend this restaurant.",

Add to that the working knowledge of the processes involved, the origins of the products etc. that the staff all possess & are happy to pass on as well as their general pleasantness and you've got a winning combination.  An addition to the Sygn/Westroom/Monteith's stable the Leith Chop House is very obviously in safe hands with a clear vision and ethos and in Opearations Manager Murray it has a very convivial host for it's small but informative monthly wine events.",

Service was friendly, good selection of meat and seafood. I'm assured the burger was amazing. The steaks were all well cooked. My bone marrow gravy was delicious. The sides we had were all tasty if portions a tad small. The kimchi slaw was about a heaped tablespoon, rather pricey at 3.50!  Good cocktail menu. I had a whisky cocktail with bee pollen and honey.   They have the meat aging in a fridge which you can go and look at.   My only complaint was that it was incredibly loud. With very on trend minimalist decor, there was nothing to absorb the noise at the bar. We all felt like we were yelling to be heard at our table of four.   Decided to go for a drink elsewhere so we didn't end up hoarse tomorrow!",

I was wrong, good for me!   The Leith Chop House provided super high class informal service, no mistakes, nothing to note as off. Just. Superb.  I choose the 60 Day hung sirloin and it was divine. Can't say more as I may go all lyrical about it.  Finally there is a steak house that has an actual open fire grilled steaks and they age and prepare all the meat in house.   You should try and visit as I can only recommend the place with great enthusiasm!  Oh and we were allowed to bring in our own bottle of wine (Blackwood Lodi Zinfandel), so that made choosing the steak better as we could spend a little more.",

    "text": "We had not intended to go to a steak bar for dinner. Still, it was to be expected: we'd went for a wander on empty stomaches with cause for celebration.  We walked from Stockbridge to Leith and wound up at Leith Chop House. It's modern and atmospheric; sharp and slick. Looking through the windows from the street, we were curious. It looked mysterious and that, in itself, was enough to lead us inside.  Staff were friendly and welcoming, and we felt attended to. I really enjoyed the music; it was really funky and energetic, a mix of funk and soul. Maybe just a teeny, tiny bit too loud to comfortably talk over. But still, the atmosphere was a lively one and it wasn't a huge problem.  Now, 'how was the meat?' I hear you cry. Pretty damn good. We went for the burgers which came with such juicy, seasoned-to-perfection meat. I'd say that this was one of the best burgers I've had in that respect. And, no doubt, great meat is a necessity for a great burger. It was a simple offering; no house sauce, no frills. - Just lettuce, tomato and cheese. But simple can be wonderful, and this was a fine, fine burger regardless.  I loved the chips; proper chunky chips. - Again, with strong seasoning game.   I foresee steak at Leith Chop House soon.",

Had we not been bamboozled by our waitress we would have gone for a steak each and more sides rather than the more expensive but smaller sharing steak.

It was served with a brioche bun. Simple but good food. In fact, it was the best burger I have ever had! I never wanted that burger to end. But it eventually did, and the plate was clear. The burger was so juicy and perfect that I couldn't fault it in any way. Simple food but done really well.   Mondays and Tuesdays are BYOB (5 corkage).",

    "text": "One might wonder how a vegetarian managed to end up eating at a steakhouse, but the pals were determined to go and who am I to argue? I thought it might be interesting to see what there was on offer for me, anyway.   The decor is all concrete and copper and tile and frosted glass, which made it LOUD.  I'd not want one of their tables for two, as they looked fairly cramped, but our spacious, heated booth was grand.  We had a couple of really delicious cocktails while we waited in the wee bar, though my friend's two identical cocktails tasted completely different from the first one to the next, so some consistency is required behind the bar there.  The wine list is keenly priced (bottles start at 20 and don't go much past the 80 mark) and our organic Fiano was a good choice.   Food-wise, my friends adored their steaks, and claimed they were cooked exactly as ordered, and my token veggie option (gnocchi gratin in a mushroomy garlicky cream) was fine - small for the price and nothing outstanding but hey, folk aren't coming here to eat potato dumplings.  The sides were nicely presented and well executed, but that's where they get you at 3 quid a pop, and you don't get anything with your meat except a tiny pot of sauce, so they really are a necessity. Five sides between 3 wasn't really enough, either.   Coffee was good - decent crema on the espresso. Nice cups.   Where we felt a bit cheated was with our post-prandial nip of whisky. We asked for a list and were told there wasn't one, so we went up to the bar to have a look. I chose my standard Old Pulteney, and my friend picked a 17 year-old Mortlach as we'd not tried that one. Whiskies drank, we got the bill, to find that the Mortlach was 15 quid a dram! At no point could we see prices, nor were we told at the bar when we ordered that this was a \"premium\" spirit. Kind of a dampener on the end of a good night.   Service was efficient and friendly, if a little slow. They had a large party and were totally full on a Tuesday night though, so the three of them did a grand job considering. We were busy chatting and drinking wine, anyway, and they had offered us bread while we waited, which we turned down.  All in all, if you're a steak lover, you'll like this place. Come with a group of friends. Order a few bottles from the cheap end of the list. Share all the sides. Don't bother with anything that isn't a steak. I won't be back, but will happily recommend it to those I know would appreciate it.",
