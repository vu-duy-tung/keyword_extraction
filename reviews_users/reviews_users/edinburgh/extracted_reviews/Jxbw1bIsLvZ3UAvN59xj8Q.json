    "text": "The restaurant has recently moved their cuisine to Italian rather than the Scottish fare the older reviews refer to. I believe it is less than a week since they changed the menu which is why I've given them 4* rather than 3* (ideally a 3.5 would be right at the moment). There is definite potential in the food and the menu here. I have to say the dishes that I had were very tasty and just required a certain something to lift them  to the next level.   The desserts however were really quite excellent!  The atmosphere is quirky but lovely and relaxed. I felt like I'd been transported to a village restaurant sat above the local old mans pub.  The staff are incredibly friendly and if I find myself in Newington in the future I believe I will go back to sample some more of Ivan's (the Italian head chef) nosh :)",

    "text": "Hidden above a busy pub (in itself a great place for pre-meal drinks) the New Bell is a modern restaurant in the Newington area of Edinburgh.  The food is splended, with the Guinea Fowl main being a particular hit with me and my fellow diners. The staff are friendly and helpful, but without being over bearing while we were thrying to enjoy our meal. There is also a lunch menu available.   The New Bell has an informal atmosphere more akin to a small cafe than a restaurant, giving it a relaxed and friendly vibe over all.  At the end of the night I was more than suprised at how much the meal had come to, in contrast to other restaurants of this standard. Despite the slighty expensive prices, it was agreed that the night had been a success, and we would return.",

    "text": "The contrast of the Old and New Bell is really interesting, and was what initially drew me to try out this restaurant that I have heard so much about.  Upon arrival, I really didn't know what to think. The pub beneath is old, indeed, and very traditional, so to be honest I expected some sort of eatery above that served up hotpot and fish with mushy peas, but what I got was really surprising.  First of all, the decor is great. Think ye olde worlde mixed with cosy granny's kitchen, and you're almost there. It's a great mix of old pictures, mismatched furniture and gorgeous dark wooden beams, which makes it feel warm and cosy, and compliments the dining experience perfectly.   As I mentioned before, I expected some traditional pub grub in here, but what I got can only be described as fine dining. The salmon and haddock fish cakes were thick and meaty, and the zesty vegetable salad was the perfect accompaniment. For main, I had the aubergine and chickpea ragu, which was a fantastic dish, even though I don't usually go for veggie mains if there's a meat alternative. The two courses were more than enough, and because we got to the restaurant before seven, we were eligible for the pre-theatre, which was a reasonable 14.50 each. A bottle of house wine was around 15, and so the bill was pleasantly surprising!  I can't wait to come back, because just as we were leaving, a waitress whizzed past, plate in hand, and sitting on it was a delicious looking hazelnut panacotta, which I will most definitely be trying next time!",

    "text": "The New Bell is a fine-dining restaurant that sits above the Old Bell Inn in Causewayside. From the look and feel of the lively pub beneath, you wouldn't necessarily believe that a wonderful restaurant serving well thought out and exquisite Scottish cuisine lies above. The restaurant is quite homely and almost quaint in its decor, it puts me in mind of an old fashioned country house occupied by the sort of people who wear waxed Barbour jackets  and own a couple of Labradors. It's classy yet understated and this sentiment is mirrored in the food which showcases the best of Scottish produce without being pretentious or fussy. This is perhaps not the place to bring fashionable friends, but it is the perfect venue for a meal with your parents or some rich relatives from out of town.",

The restaurant doesn't disappoint either with excellent Scottish food and exceptional desserts (which if you ask nicely can be served to pub goers when you order a pint!).   Highly recommended to book as its often extremely busy",
