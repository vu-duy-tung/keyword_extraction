    "text": "A friend recommended this restaurant and kept pestering me to call for a booking. I am SO glad she did!  We called the evening before and they were able to squeeze us in for a 5:30 pm reservation on a Friday night (in November). We were the first to arrive but were not made to feel like we were imposing on the staff. Very small restaurant, was giddy excited they could fit us in on such short notice.  Service was friendly and very comfortable. No issue ordering tap water and it was refilled!  Oh and this was no regular tap water, it was cucumber and mint infused!  If you dine early, there is a pre-fix menu. I chose the three course for 14.95 (two for 11.95). My starter was the mussel saffron tagliatelle. Aside from the color, saffron didn't come through much and it was interesting to see the mussels out of the shell but this was a nice size for a starter and nice flavors. I couldn't resist the pork chop over pearl barley risotto BUT was worried the pork would be over-cooked and risotto bland. NOT AT ALL. The pork was perfectly cooked (pre-sliced for me) and the fat cripsy and salty. The pearl barley risotto was nice and milky. The sliced apple pieces provided a good cut to lighten the taste and add to the texture. This was a stand out dish. I finished it with the chocolate brownie and peanut butter ice cream (which i shared with my dining companion). The brownie tasted sugarless and flourless (not in a good way), but the ice cream (made in the restaurant) was decadent. Exactly what an American living in London missing peanut butter needed.  I also recommend the Sicilian bottle of Shiraz. Very surprised at how smooth it was.  There is a reason this is not five stars - and it's because of my companion's meal. it really didn't measure up. The butternut squash soup to begin was good but the entree - vegetarian: Butternut Squash Risotto Log, Fennel Quiche & Warm Gorgonzola was a miss. It was as if three appetizers were put on one plate with nothing tying them together. And even individually, none were above average. She agreed though my choices were stand out.  All in all, this restaurant was very reasonably priced, attentive service, and great food. I'd go back in a second if in Edinburgh. Call now!",

    "text": "So this was recommended to me when I put out a question on yelp asking where would be good to go in Edinburgh.......thank you so much to those who highlighted this to me as it was absolutely the type of place I was looking for and I love love loved it from the moment I clapped eyes on it!   We were staying in a hotel about 10-15 minutes walk away from here and after a rather chilly time trying to find it I was so happy when we arrived at this little cosy intimate restaurant with a warm welcome and easy relaxed atmosphere.   We got seated at a lovely little table for two at the window and settled down with a bottle of my favourite type of wine  - a Sauvignon blanc from New Zealand - which was very reasonably priced.   The menu was brought over by the nicest man ever and it was cool - menu in a picture frame - and looked super yummy! What to choose? We actually both ended up choosing the same things. The scallops with satay, pomegranate and peanut tuille to start and the five spice duck breast with baklava and pickled leeks for main.   As we waited we were brought theeee most delicious yummy bread roll ever - it was warm from the oven and tasted of fresh garlic and I could have eaten three of these no problem with butter. It brings back happy memories just thinking about them!   Starter came and it was fab. Not huge portions but delicious and the pomegranate combined beautifully with the scallop and cashew satay. We both loved it.   Then the main came and it was just delish! Perfectly cooked slightly pink duck with crispy skin in a rich sticky sauce. Balanced with the pickled veg and crispy pastry. It was different and great.   So we had to have pudding - cookie dough parfait for me and a chocolate fondant with marshmallow ice cream for the boyf. Both great - although the parfait and cookie were rather firm and there were a few close calls to it jumping out of the bowl as I tried to get a bit on the spoon. But perfect finish to a great meal.   Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice and reasonably priced (esp compared to a lot of other menus) meal in Edinburgh! It's worth looking for",

    "text": "Straight into my top 5 restaurants in Edinburgh, despite there not being any sign of a red meat main course. Firstly, the decor is great, subtle, dark and warming. We counted 22 seats, but any more would be crammed, probably half full at 8pm on a Saturday night. We got a nice table in te corner, the best table by the window was already occupied by some young lovers, who were smiling from ear to ear.  Menu was on the simple side, but inviting with plenty of options, we had the smoked salmon and the mackarel terrine, both dishes were fantastic - but the terrine was a game changer, such depth of flavour it was amazing. FYI we got a bottle of Prosecco also (20) and it was smooth and creamy.  Main courses, we ordered the chorizo burger and the fish pie, the chorizo being all I had hoped for, with peppercorn sauce on the side and sweet potato home fries... Amazing!  Cheese and Eton mess for dessert, nespresso coffee and we couldn't fault it a bit... Get in there now before they are queuing out the door - 5 out of 5!",

    "text": "When Moray L and I fancied one of our dinner and catchup evenings near to her work, Field sprang to mind as a place I'd been meaning to try for ages. And with a dinner earlybird \"pre-theatre\" for 14.95 it was hard to find a reason not to!  I was excited, given the swathes of five-star reviews it's been garnering, but also tentative. I needn't have been, because wowee, what a place!  My starter, sauteed wild mushrooms on toasted brioche, was paradise. I want to eat it every day for the rest of my life. There was nothing, nothing, nothing not to love about it, except that it was over when I had eaten it all. That made me sad.  But not for long, because steering towards me at a goodly rate of knots was a glee dream of a sea bream. I deliberately avoided the chicken offered on the menu because I ALWAYS have chicken, so I took a risk on a fishy I'd never had before and boy, am I glad I did. Crispy skin, melt-in-the-mouth flesh, and the peas with bacon were an incredibly rich and delicious addition. In fact, if anything, with the chips involved as well there was almost too much here and I was struggling toward the end, with a shivering fear that pudding might elude me.  Pudding, I say with such relieved gratitude that you may picture me falling to my knees, did not elude me. Pudding enchanted me. Pudding was a cherry mouse with chocolate sorbet, not too sweet but seriously sophisticated and just... ugh, too good.  Another lovely touch in this adorably dinky little restaurant is the constant top-ups of cucumber water. I'm also a big fan of the giant bull painting on the wall - thematic, but quirky.  Yep, this is a helluva place. It is very likely to become my standard go-to before a night at the Festival Theatre. Thank you, lovely Field!",

The price point is entirely spot on as well. Actually the price point is a steal for what you are getting. I've paid a lot more for a lot less at 'flasher' restaurants around town.  Their wine list is fabulous as well.  I've not had a bad meal here and I've had quite a few, do yourself a favour and eat here. Just make sure you book. With a capacity for about 20, it fills up quickly!!",

Probably one of my best dinner experiences in Edinburgh.   Loses a star from me because of limited vegetarian options - I believe there was a single veggie option each in the starters and entrees. (Although honestly the meaty dishes were enticing enough that I was almost tempted to stray from my usually fairly strict vegetarianism...)",

If Field's in-house service is anything near as good as it's online customer service I'm pretty confident they could serve me poop on a plate and I would forgive it! I wanted to get friends a gift card here as a thank you and chose Field because of its impeccable Yelp reveiws!   The menu looks AMAZING and it's killing me that I didn't eat here when I was over for New Years but... fast forward to February and upon emailing Field with my request for a gift card to be mailed by Field to my friend's address in Edinburgh, with a Thank You note, I half expected them to virtually spit in my face. Instead I was greeted with a lovely email back, informing me that they were happy to do this AND I didn't need to send extra postage for them to send this - as they were just happy that I chose them out of all the restaurants in Edinburgh.   As a former Edinburgh resident, I'm aching to try this place but all you lovely people in the Burgh' give it a try and let me know how it is! :) 5 stars for service from me!   Cheers,  Megan",

We went for lunch (doing this is tip #2, it makes it more affordable to come to Field - 3 courses for 16 pounds seemed really fair to us). The food was absolutely delicious, no exceptions. And tip #3: Get the ravioli with truffled mashed potatoes and egg yolk and a parmesan beignet. Incredibly creative not something you would ever make at home. And delicious!!",

Although, if you can wait, simply jaunt across the street to the Peartree for a pint, and they'll give you a jingle when a table is up.  It's philosophy is farm to table, with local Scottish ingredients, with the result of good food.  The menu isn't vast, unsurprisingly, but each item seemed appealing.  It's a very romantic spot, and a nice change from a Haggis burger!",

I had Samlon to start which was lovely and cheap at 5.95 I think.   Main was Maple Glazed Duck Breast with Wild Mushroom Samosa, Grilled Pak Choi, Sweet Potato Fondant & Chartreuse Sauce (13.50) My partner had one of the Fish dishes which was absolutely delish! A big juicy portion of Hake with a huge stack of chips - they boy was in heaven! Dessert was Chocolate Pave with Caramelised Banana, Toasted Pine Nuts & Peanut Butter Ice Cream (5.50). I was intrigued by the peanut butter ice cream and worried it wouldn't quite work but, oh my, it really did. The saltiness and the sweetness go together really well and this was a stand-out component of a really great pud!  There's a good choice of wines on offer we had a fantastic Sancerre and they also have one of my favourite dessert wines Tokaji that was gorgeous.   All in all this is a great little gem of a restaurant with all the taste and technique of high quality dining without any of the pomposity or any suggestion of over-pricing. I'll definitely be visiting again...",

    "text": "WHEN YOU THINK of the name Field, you think of grassy pastures, hills and fresh air.  Field's mission statement is to take the concepts of Michelin dining and turn it into a relaxed affair and that's a breath of fresh air indeed.  Opening in January of this year, the restaurant is run by an ambitious team who have taken their experiences from several notable establishments and put their own spin on fine dining.  Chef Gordon Craig for example, has worked at the Roux family's Waterside Inn, the Michelin starred Peat Inn and the Plumed Horse, while Maitre D' Richard Conway worked at the later as restaurant manager.  My partner Sarah couldn't manage to this one, so I invited my brother Chris instead and he kindly added some professional photography skills to my humble blog.   Richard greeted us warmly when we arrived  and we admired the freshness and feel of the dining area as the sunshine beamed through the windows.   Instantly relaxed, you could tell there was going to be no pretention about Field and the giant cow picture brought both a talking point and a statement about the ethos of the restaurant.  Our menus came playfully in a luminous green picture frames and offered an intriguing mix of seasonal dishes.    As we awaited our order, we tucked into some delicious homemade sun dried tomato bread.  Always pleasing to see bread being made in house.  Chris opted for the asparagus, poached egg, parmesan crisp and pickled shimeji (5.95), while I went for beetroot cured Scottish salmon, citrus creme fraiche, raisin and caper compote, pickled peppers and crispy crab ball (5.25).  My starter was the perfect choice for a summery day: fresh, clean, light and zingy, it utilised the colours on the plate well and showed off some good quality ingredients.  The salmon was wonderfully tender and paired well with the bite of the pickled peppers. The citrus of the creme fraiche and flavours of the compote really excited the palette. The crab ball was crisp and had a pleasant note of dill through it, which I really liked.  Chris's asparagus came nicely chargrilled and still had suitable bite to it.  He burst the egg yolk to release a rich and velvety liquid centre that complimented the asparagus. The pickled mushroom gave a good contrast to the plate too, while the sauce brought it together.   This dish was simple yet effective and the chef really allows the ingredients to do the talking.  I'm a man who really enjoys a good burger and after a fellow blogger recommended Field's chorizo burger (9.95)  earlier in the week, my mind was already made up on my main course.  Moist and tasty, the burger didn't disappoint.  It was a tad pink in places, which would probably put a few people off but I like my meat that way and gladly polished it off.  The sweet potato chips were very earthy and without a hint of grease on them.     However, the spicy mayo could have done with a bit more oomph for me.  Enjoying his first Phil's Food World outing, Chris went for the pan friend hake with creamed sweetcorn, avocado, chorizo and chunky chips (11.95).   The hake was very fresh and the flesh inside soft and flaky but we felt the skin could have been crisper.  Chris enjoyed the creamed sweetcorn in particular, as it partnered the fish superbly and was well seasoned and vibrant.     You could tell the perfectly uniform manner in which the chorizo and avocado had been cut that this is a chef that cares what comes out of his kitchen.  Chris's generous portion of chips was equally as good as mine, which shows a good level of consistency and they dipped nicely into the creamed corn too!  So, to the third and final course and I went for coconut panna cotta with roasted pineapple and creamed gingerbread (4.95) with Chris selecting peach tart tatin with Birds custard ice cream (5.50).  The panna cotta was just set and no more and tasted pleasant.  The coconut on the outside added texture and enhanced the coconut taste of the mild set cream.  The pineapple in this Caribbean inspired dish worked with the coconut but could have been roasted a little more to add another dimension of flavour.  Unfortunately, I didn't really get anything from the gingerbread cream element.  Chris ordered peach tart tatin with Birds custard ice cream and was impressed with the way the home-made ice cream balanced out the sharpness of syrup. The tart itself was very tasty and the pastry was expertly cooked. The ice cream was certainly a notable highlight of this pudding.  Field has only been open around six months and is certainly one to watch. The team's philosophies and menus are excellent and extremely good value for money. It'll be interesting to see the restaurant develop in the near future.  I have to say it's certainly one of the friendliest and most relaxing restaurants I've visited in a while.",

The really pleasing thing is that while our visit, today, was filled with excellence, from start to finish, this felt like a comfortable level of class from which stellar brilliance can develop. I'm confident that Field can grow to become one of Edinburgh's premier dining spots.

    "text": "since Field opened, i have long heard of its merits but never actually had a chance to actually dine there.  then after a brief discussion months ago in book club, we decided it was the perfect spot for our christmas dinner.  now in my view a christmas dinner is a True test of how good a restaurant actually is.  you get handed a set menu with limited options and due to the volume of diners sometimes your actual meal (regardless of how good the restaurant is) is not actually that good. however i needn't have had this worry about Field, although the menu was short and the restaurant completely full the dinner was up to the standard that had been set by previous reviews.  after deliberating over the menu choices during the day, i finally decided to have the makerel with beetroot, horseradish, and crispy quails egg followed by the chicken with creamed brussel sprouts and cranberry jus and ending my meal with the cheese plate.  i only had two disappointments, the first being that i could order a tasting selection of all the choices on offer and the second that i seemed to manage to finish each course far too quickly.  without exaggeration this was one of the nicest meals i have had in edinburgh for ages.  the makerel was fresh and blended perfectly with the beetroot and horseradish, the crispy quails egg just be a lovely wee crunchy treat to end with.  the chicken was beyond tender and the brussel sprouts were so tasty i could have eaten a second portion and the crispy potato crouqette that accompained the dish was just divine.  the cheese plate was just the right size and had slightly different cheeses than just the usual cheddar and blue.  the price for the meal was quite reasonable, three courses for 26 and even the a la carte choices seem well priced, so a classy but not overpriced meal out.  what i also loved about Field was the restaurant itself.  the staff are absolutely lovely, so friendly and helpful and really make the whole dining experience superb.  the place is small, but cosy with simple decor and on the cold wintery night we went they had a toasty fire on to keep everyone warm.    of all the places i've eaten in Edinburgh, i think i finally have a new favourite.  the food here is superb, the staff are so lovely, and the whole experience is just 5 stars.  i can't wait to go back!",

If and when I'm back in Scotland, I'd love to come here again.",

I'm not sure if I'd recommend a romantic meal here because you're so close to everyone else eating it doesn't really seem intimate. The menu looked promising and familiar to us (this restaurant concept is popular in our home town and very successful). We ordered the scallops for an appetizer. It was nice, but lacking in seasoning. I ordered the fish dish and when it came out, I realized it was the exact same dish as the scallops, just win a piece for bass instead of scallops. It was extremely under seasoned. It may have been my fault for not catching that the descriptions were similar, but I'm not sure why you'd have two so similar dishes on such a limited menu in the first place. Even though everything was Th I ally cooked well, we were ultimately dissappointed with our meal because everything was so bland and the price so steep. I don't mind paying for good food, but this was definitely not worth the price.",

We had a delicious meal, for a very reasonable price. The atmosphere within the restaurant is welcoming whilst unobtrusive, and the staff are similarly charming and professional. A main focus of Field seems to be local, sustainable ingredients, and my coley dish was great. On the waiters recommendation, I had the treacle tart for dessert which was really great, comforting and delicious. My friends similarly enjoyed their meal, (chicken with Parma ham) and thought if perfect for the fringe or celebration, as well as an indulgent mid week treat. One final thing, we shared a great bottle of white wine recommended to us as the lunch time bottle was not available for dinner, which just happened to be the cheapest?! I think it was this point we fell in love with Field",

    "text": "For a name that conjures images of expansive open spaces, Field is a surprisingly cosy space. Nestled on West Nicolson, right by the University and across from a rather bustling student sports bar, (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/the-peartree-house-edinburgh\">yelp.co.uk/biz/the-peart...</a>), you could walk right past the restaurant without noticing it if you weren't careful. And that would be a shame, since it was very good!   I came here for a family dinner, and we enjoyed the intimate space, friendly service, and carefully prepared dishes. To start we ordered drinks, and while they have a nice wine list, they didn't have as much in the way of beer or cocktail selection. Then, we had appetizers: White Onion and Beer Soup, Fried Octopus, and Smoked Chicken and Mousse  Salad. All very good! Although not my dish, apparently the chicken salad was phenomenal :)   For our main courses, I had roast rabbit loin, and my companions had vegetable tikki and a rack of lamb. My dish was quite tasty, and plated nicely, although nothing out of the ordinary. The Tikki (not sure what that is, actually), was crunchy, spicy, and tasted very nutritious. The rack of lamb could've been served a little warmer but was cooked to perfection and of very high quality.   Dessert is actually where Field really shone-- we ordered some tea and I enjoyed the raspberry \"cheesecake.\" It was spectacularly tasty, and quite inventive, not what you think of at all for a cheesecake, it was instead crispy layers of caramelized hazelnut crumb biscuit with what seemed like mascarpone cheese in between. Yum! Also tasty, the chocolate mousse, and lemon curd meringue tart.   What a lovely dinner, not horribly expensive, and conveniently located in the old town while neatly avoiding becoming some garish tourist trap! An excellent choice for a finer meal in Edinburgh, and after dinner you can walk over to campus to see Teviot square and McEwan hall which look quite nice lit up at night!",

As our starters, we shared the lemon and leek ravioli and venison tartare. I wouldn't recommend the ravioli just because it's a single piece. Really should be called a raviolo. The venison tartare was wonderful though.  For my main, I had the pan-roasted partridge served over potatoes and mushrooms. It was cooked perfectly, and was paired well with the jus.  I also tried the lamb neck, served with a parsnip puree and leeks. It was very well balanced, and all the flavors complemented the lamb very well. Definitely a highlight.  The portion sizes are a bit small, so load up on appetizers.  And keep in mind that this place is fancy by Edinburgh standards, but it's still not wildly unaffordable, so order that extra bottle of wine!",

I went with my friend here for dinner and chose the pre-theatre deal... A three course meal for 15.95. The first course was a fish fish (sorry forgot what the type of fish) on top of well season bed of grain. The crisps which were made from turnip have the dish an extra crunch. The fish was well seasoned and the flavour of the overall fish worked with the various combination of texture. I wanted more of the crisps! I could have eaten that all day!   For the main course I ordered a chicken dish. I usually try to avoid chicken but in this case I couldn't resist cause it had a type of grain I wanted to try. The chicken was so well cooked, no pink, but well seasoned, mmmoooiiisssttt, and worked well with grain. It surprisingly came in a generous portion and completely satisfied my hunger and slapped my taste buds around.   The dessert I got chocolate mouse with bananas. It was a decent dessert, not something I'd rave over but satisfying.   The staff were all nice and friendly, kept my friend well attended and made sure all was good. The place is small so it's important to make a booking and the pre-theatre deal end at 6:45 pm.",

My truffled mashed potato ravioli was so rich and yummy with delightful bits of butternut squash and toasted walnuts, not to mention the poached egg yolk that was waiting for me in the center of the ravioli. Plus, who could forget about the delicious Parmesan beignet on the side of said ravioli, talk about dying and going to food heaven! For dessert my husband and I split the decadent dark chocolate cremeux with white chocolate ice cream, salted caramel and candied hazelnuts. Perfect for sharing!   The cheerful staff and inexpensive price tag was also much appreciated. Definitely a must stop if you are in Edinburgh, just don't forget to make a booking!",

I'd have to say that I'm going to recommend this place to anyone who will listen to me about where to go for a really special dining experience without breaking the bank. I went for the Beetroot cured salmon to start with which was served with a wonderful avocado mayo and crispy crab ball followed by the pork belly which basically just fell apart it was that tender! Loads of people went for the specials board steak which was amazing too (I always try to make 'please share with me eyes' across the table) but I felt comfortable in my decision to go for the pork - so, so good!   So ambience was easily a 5, the food was a 5 too so why the 4 star Yelp review? Again it was the beer selection that let the place down - 2 bottles on offer -  one was a local lager that was ok and Peroni - WTF? In fact the waiter sold me the local lager as basically a \"don't worry it's not too hoppy\" which is like saying to me don't worry about the food it's not that tasty. If they can ditch the Peroni and bring in a couple of proper beers that would massively compliment the food then I may even start lobbying Yelp to introduce a 6 star for reviews...",

They take what is signature to this land and make culinarily forward dishes with them that blend old and new together.  Our experience there was nice; quiet and peaceful.  We split the Lemon and Leek ravioli which was really delicious -leeks are grown well in Scotland and this creative dish highlights that. My only note here is that we only got 1 ravioli as if it was an individual starter. I'm not a giant eater, but 2 raviolis would've been easier to split.  I had the Scottish Salmon which was DIVINE! So buttery and with a crisp skin. Great citrus flavors! Scottish salmon is the best.  Mom had the baked Butternut Squash dish which was earthy and warming on a cold day; perfect for Fall! For dessert, knowing the sizes were more individual, we city got the Pumpkin Tart with Pumpkin Brittle. Sweet, smooth pumpkin tart with earthy crunch of the brittle. This was divine in October!  So the food and atmosphere are great! Now, it is on the pricey side and maybe a wee bit too pricey for the portions it is serving, but you are getting mindful food which is great!  Keep in mind this place is small, so I recommend making a booking as it seems to be always full!",

    "text": "What an exceptional restaurant! Delicious food which is immaculately presented and a lovely, cosy atmosphere made this the perfect place to finish off my work trip to Edinburgh.   I love the small menu here - just 4 options for starters and mains (as well as one special) means you know that they're only dishing up the best of the best dishes. I couldn't go past the beetroot cured salmon, avocado mayonnaise, beetroot, passion fruit \"cannelloni\" & crispy crab ball - that's at least 5 of my favourite foods, all magically combined in one dish. And for the crazy price of 5.95 for a starter. The dish was bright, colourful, delicate, and everything was drawn together by the delicious avocado mayonnaise. Absolute heaven on a plate.   For mains I went for the smoked duck breast with celeriac remoulade, celeriac chips & spiced apple. I cheekily asked if I could have a side of the avocado that goes with the pork belly - baked avocado with sweet corn & chorizo gratin which wasn't a problem and I was delighted that I got this addiction as it was so sweet and creamy, the salty chorizo and pops of corn meant I wolfed this down pretty quickly. The duck was excellent with crispy skin and nice and juicy inside. With a ring of accompaniments dotted around the plate, it looked more like an artwork than something I should be eating.   I was pretty full but as a group we got some desserts to share, so I had some of the mojito sorbet which was lovely and refreshing, the perfect way to finish a decadent meal. When I asked the waiter about dairy free options he was all set to go and get the kitchen to whip something up just for me which was really kind of him, but I declined because I knew there was no way I could eat a whole dessert at this stage!   For such a great meal I thought the prices were really reasonable - just over 20 for two courses. There was a really decent selection of wines and the viognier we were drinking was light and refreshing. Service was great and never far away (the restaurant is really small so I guess that's quite easy to keep on top of). I'd definitely head back here when in Edinburgh and would even go so far as heading to Edinburgh just to eat here, it's that good.",

The staff like Rachel in the front of house are so friendly and helpful, and Chefs Richard and Byron are always experimenting with great new creations.   I first went to Field over a year ago for a friend's birthday. I had a beautiful, rich dish of pork belly with black pudding gnocchi which was divine. For dessert, we discovered the 'jaffaron' - a delicious and creative Jaffa cake Macaron.   I went with friends to Field this week for their set Christmas dinner menu. The choices for starters included oxtail ravioli, duck liver pate, tomato and Aubergine soup, and mackerel. I wasn't overly keen on any of them honestly. For the main I was really eager to try the chicken with chestnuts which was excellent. For dessert I had the pistachio layer cake with homemade cherry ice cream. Everything was absolutely beautifully presented but not as flavorful with pistachio as I would have hoped.   I always have a lovely time at Field, and it is a beautiful place with high-quality, excellently presented food.",

This was our second visit to Field, but our first time to enjoy their A la carte menu, as we opted for the pre-theatre deal last time.   The restaurant itself is small and cosy, with stylish grey decor, a large cow canvas on one wall, and various farm animals dotted around. The staff are incredibly friendly and welcoming and the service was great.   To start we shared the Chicken, Pancetta, Feta & Roast Red Pepper Ballotine  with Wild Mushroom Samosa- it was deeeelish! Well, that was after they had brought us delicious (freshly baked) roasted red pepper rolls. They were amazing, warm bready, buttery goodness! Next up I had the Slow Cooked Pork Belly, Citrus Fennel, Baked Avocado with Sweetcorn & Chorizo Gratin, Ponzu Sauce which was lovely. The meat was the softest meltiest pork belly I have ever eaten and the baked avocado was amazing! The boy went for the Smoked Duck Breast with Celeriac Remoulade, Celeriac Chips & Spiced Apple which he really enjoyed and both dishes were beautifully presented. To finish we shared the Pink praline tart which was also very pretty and came with a lovely almond ice cream.   If you fancy a delicious meal out for slightly less, their pre-theatre menu is excellent good value with 2 courses for around 12 pounds or 3 for 15.  Overall a very delicious meal, a great atmosphere and a very lovely evening out.",

    "text": "Having looked at other reviews which wetted my desire to eat here, I really expected a lot from this restaurant.  It's a cosy place with friendly staff (just try not to get the table beside the door as you'll suffer from the cold air in winter when people come & go). The a la carte menu provides reasonable choice and the ambience of the place is nice & welcoming.  Food wise - we choose across the range of the menu - starters were nicely presented and flavours good - regarding the mains: the cod was perfectly cooked (and although this place is edging on fine dining getting just 3 small dice of potato is pushing things, a bit disappointing) but it was accompanied by chicken wings? the beef was nice & tender with a lovely oxtail croquette, but the amount of beef on the plate was again a little on the small side.  Our three deserts presented & held flavours well apart from one (an eclair that was burnt) which finished off our meals.  Overall it is deserving of 3.5 stars but I am rounding down as for the prices charged I just expected a little more oomph from the food",

Small, cute, seats about 22 covers and is the perfect venue for all occasions - friends dining, family gatherings, romantic nights or just a girly catch up night, it is perfect for all! Focus is on local sourcing and showcasing the best of ingredients. Sample menu's on-line but subject to change as it is all about what is seasonal and available at the time.  Went firstly for my birthday. Blythe R had been raving about it for ages and particularly had pointed out how amazing they were for gluten free so with that recommendation, it was on the to-do list. We were a party of seven and everyone kept saying how much they loved their dinner - like Carol W, I had the maple glazed duck, wild mushroom samosa (yep, gf!), grilled pak choi, sweet potato fondant and chartreuse sauce and it was all divine! I had also started with the Salmon so when it came to dessert, I passed to instead have tea.   Well, I thought I wouldn't have dessert. Two of the girls ordered dessert and as we all tried and started making Meg Ryan sex noises (think sandwich shop in When Harry Met Sally) as it was THAT good, I ordered dessert and shared it round all the non dessert eaters. So - the dessert in question? A jaffa cake macaroon - completely gluten free - macaroon base, chocolate sorbet, orangey centre, cream and little chocolate dome to hide the orangey goodness then it is amazing, hence the 2nd visit.  Second visit was really for dessert but we figured we needed a main first and a gorgeous bottle of Yealand Sauv Blanc - as you do. Again, stunning food and that dessert - OMG!   Consistently amazing food, great wine list and fantastic service, I just feel that no matter how I write about Field, I'm not doing it justice - bravo!",

Lovely, intimate space was perfectly complemented by friendly and expert service.  Since we were eating on the early side, several in our group opted for the pre-theater menu, which was incredibly priced given the quality of the food (all perfectly executed).  I had a cheese curd starter (think burrata, with tender greens and hazelnuts), with a sea trout entree, both of which were seasonal, delicious, and perfectly done.  Dessert was a roasted peach with lemon thyme ice cream and almonds - divine.  Everyone else in our group was equally pleased.  Oh, and our server managed to choose a bottle of wine that was sublime with the adults' varied choices.  Would return in an instant.",

    "text": "If you want a top notch dining experience, you just have to go to Field. I went there with a big group last night and we were all blown away by the quality of the food, the wine and the service!  The menu is short and simple, which is a good sign as you immediately know everything on there's going to be well done. There's no filler dishes - they're all there for a reason - and from what I tasted and saw around the table, the standard of dish was consistently high!  I opted for the chicken starter and the pork belly main and loved them both. The chicken starter was brought out on a beautiful wooden platter and arranged wonderfully, with bursts of colour and delicate placement. The flavours were great in this dish and it had enough different aspects - the chicken, the samosa, the feta stuffed peppers - to make it an exciting start to the meal.   When my main arrived I was equally as impressed. The baked avocado was insane. I mean it was, quite literally, mind-boggingly delicious. Baked to perfection and topped with cheese, chorizo and sweetcorn it was just one of the tastiest combos I have ever had. It sat alongside the pork belly really well and is something I will absolutely be making (attempting) at home. The pork itself was beautifully cooked but lacked a slight crispiness that I would have enjoyed. The fat was a little thick and soft for my taste, but otherwise the meat was flavoured wonderfully.  To top it all off, we shared desserts for the table and, though I can't recall what each of them was, they were all super tasty and very beautiful!   Field is just hitting the nail on the head here. With some of the most attentive staff I've ever come across and the perfect vibe of a cosy by still atmospheric venue, Field ticks all the boxes for me. If only it were in Brighton... I'll have to make sure I get back up to Edinburgh again soon to taste some more of it's delights.",

    "text": "Just before we moved to Scotland from overseas, our best friend (and best man) gave us the amazing wedding gift of gift certificates to two fancy restaurants in our new hometown. (What a genius, right?!) Field was one of them.  We actually had our dinner here back on (American) Thanksgiving Day, as there had been no turkeys to be found, but I had been so busy with school at the time that I never ended up leaving a review, and the guilt still plagues me--the meal was THAT good!!  So, my long overdue review: The best way to put it is that the dinner we had here was absolutely grand. Of course, being two rather easy-going young adults, we had actually never been to such a high-class establishment before, so I'm sure we were both rather awkward, but the lovely man serving us made us feel so comfortable and cared for. We were extremely well taken care of, and THE FOOD!! The food was incredible. Every single bite had all these fantastic flavors and perfect, contrasted textures, and just wow. The dishes were all crafted from locally sourced ingredients (many of which we hadn't tasted before!), and it was all such a treat. To be honest, the plates looked small when they first came out, but we actually left incredibly satisfied and not at all hungry, despite having shared a starter before working through the two mains.  (Also, the dishes were gorgeously presented--it almost made me feel guilty to dig in!)  Also, even though the place is definitely much fancier and more up-scale than what we are used to, its presentation as a whole is somehow kept very pleasantly comfortable and organic. The formal, sophisticated color scheme is brought down to earth--and even embellished!--by features like the lovely portrait of a handsome Dexter bull on the main wall. (Just check out their website--you'll get what I mean.)  All in all, Field was so incredibly wonderful that--even though it's completely out of our experience or comfort range--we have solid plans of returning! The price is a bit high, but so very worth it for a special night out.   Lovely staff, lovely little dining room, and SUCH lovely food! Thank you, Field, and thank you, most genius best friend!",

    "text": "Field is a small business with a huge personality. From it's cute and rustic exterior to it's nice design touches (a giant canvas of a cow and cute pottery pigs), our meal at Field was a wonderful experience from start to finish.  From outside, it doesn't jump out at you as a fine dining bistro, but the fantastic customer service and amazing food really does speak for itself. Now, I have never been here before so can't give too much insider information; but I would say book in advance. The restaurant only has seating for around 20 diners and was packed out on our visit on a Wednesday night.   As well as the standard menu, the venue offers a very reasonably priced \"pre-theatre\" menu which I would definitely go for if I get back to Edinburgh. We went for the standard menu and I was impressed with every bite.  Starting with the rabbit spring roll starter, this looked every bit as good as it tasted. It was a generous portion as well - so no tiny posh nosh here! For my main, I went for the fish option. Again, everything was cooked to perfection and the fish was flaky, tender and served with wonderful crispy skin. The veg gets another shout out as it was so fresh, it tasted as though it had just come from the field.   For dessert, the team had ordered a selection of different items. I was stuffed after my starter and main but did try a little of the various sorbets. Light, sharp and wonderfully fruity - definitely recommended to finish off your fine meal. There is a great wine offering here too and the girls on the table very much enjoyed our bottle of Viognier (which suited my fish perfectly).   Again, I'm not a regular in Edinburgh; but should I be back.... I am booking a table at Field for sure!",
