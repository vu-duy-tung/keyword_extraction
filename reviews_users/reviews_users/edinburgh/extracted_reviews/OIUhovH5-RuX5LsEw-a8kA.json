    "text": "Just back from a lovely lunch at the Whiskey Society in Leith. We are not members but have a few friends who are so went with a group. It's in a lovely building just off the Shore in Leith and this time of year is great time to go - the Christmas Tree is up and is huge and covered in sliver baubles and twinkling lights.   The food was perfect hangover cure - I had cream of mushroom soup and then roast chicken dinner - you get half a chicken perfectly cooked and served up with gravy and roast spuds.   The obviously have a huge range of whiskeys but I wasn't really in fit state to drink today so stuck to soft drinks - they do really good range of Feltmans fizzy drinks - I had the lemonade and they also do ginger beer and cola.   This is a great venue - 2 log fires, big comfy leather sofas, plush surroundings and feels quite exclusive without being stuffy at all. You have to join or go with a member - membership is 100 for first year and think it 50 a year after that. Not sure we will join but will get our other friends to arrange more visits here in the near future.",

    "text": "Absolutely my favourite place.   Joining is simple, just pay up and get your entry card posted out. They have 2 venues in Edinburgh and 1 in London and you can go to any of them and sign in up to 3 guests. I've personally never liked their newer Edinburgh venue in Queens Street, which somehow always feels like an upmarket Italian dentist's waiting room but the Vaults venue is sheer heaven.   I've been a member for years, even though I don't like whiskey, just cos I love the place. It's like a warm safe cosy nest where you can snuggle into a big leather sofa by a gorgeous fire with a glass of wine and a bunch of friends and chill out.   There's no loud music, just the sounds of people, you are encouraged to take or make mobile calls outside, meetings with laptops are banned, there is never any trouble and staff will call a taxi to the door and come and get you from the bar when it arrives.   So if you actually want to relax and chat to people this is the place.   And because it's so lux and has such awesome and unique whisky it's also a truly great place to bring visitors.   The only problem is, once you've taken people there, you have a hard time persuading them to go anywhere else...",

Well my last visit was very good again; I introduced 6 of my Finnish family branch (father in law, uncles and aunties) to the delights of the SMWS.  They promptly took a seat at the roaring fire. - Yes, Fins do get cold in Auld Reekie! -  It was several times commented upon that this couldn't be a real fire, I had to assure them that it was, and no.. don't stick your hand in it!  My knowledge of whiskey has improved over the years and I was keen to show it off.  The staff was on hand to give me some nuggets of wisdom as well.   It is True, there IS a Scotch for everyone. Some weren't too familiar with the cask strengths and I introduced them to the diluting of the dram until it tasted just right.  I managed to find a Speyside number that was particular enjoyed by the ladies in the group:  this is the Stoater 35/135.   There was some hilarity and merriment when they were reading the tasting notes but after a few nips they actually had to agree that they were quite accurate!  I like visiting here and this is always a highlight when showing off Edinburgh / Leith to visiting friends and family",

As I don't have membership, I was signed in by a friend. Outturn weekend is a great time to go as that is when new bottles are available. I also found out that there is usually 3 'malt of the moments' available for just 3.50 a glass. I tried the Cherry Blossom which was lovely.  Staff are really knowledgable and know their stuff. The menu is great, products sourced from local suppliers such as Findlays and Crombies, with options for veggies and GF peeps - GF isn't marked but staff can advise. Dishes (mains) range from about 9-14. The venison burger was lovely (no bun).  All in all, a place that is so easy to chill out in, while away a few hours and work my way through the whisky menu - happy days :-)",

The selection at the Whisky Society is amazing. I mean honestly you can get tastes of whiskies that you could never afford to buy in bottle form and OMG the flavours (ok, it wasn't all smelling).

You do need to be a member to visit, although if you ask around Edinburgh, you'll soon find someone who is a member and they can sign you in as a guest.  The bar area is like a traditional members only room from the past with comfortable chairs and a roaring fire. Try and go in December and the feeling gets even better with a beautiful Christmas tree in the corner. There are also a number of private rooms that host the societies tasting events.  If you don't like whisky, it is still worth a visit just for the quality of the food that is on offer. Unlike the 28 Queen Street venue of the society it isn't fine dining but it is still great food in a bar environment. The vension burgers are to die for and the haggis, neeps and tatties is one of the best you will have.  If you do like whisky, ask behind the bar for advice on what is good and don't fall into the trap of asking for a whisky from a particular distillery because you like the supermarket version. This whisky is individual to the cask which is half the surprise as you taste a new one.",

The members' room at The Vaults is just my cup of tea then, a space almost as high as it is broad and invariably populated by the bubble of contented souls. In winter the fire will warm you, in the summer this is a relaxed and chilled hideaway. As I write this there are pairs, couples, triples, quartets and lonely singleton me tucking into their beverages and meals of choice. Someone's been sent out for using their mobile phone in a noisy manner, one of the suited staff is muttering to himself as he gathers up some whisky nosing glasses and empty coffee cups. There are other spaces too, where some of the Society's events are held and more private gatherings take place. This is quite the refuge, a lovely place to be.  The staff are both knowledgeable and good humoured, helpful and engaging. Many members of the Society are very comfortable with their knowledge of single malts from across the regions of Scotland, but there's always the chance to try something new. Given the Society policy of buying in whisky by the cask from scores of distilleries, then bottling it themselves when they deem it ready, you'll be here a while before you've even scratched the surface.",

The Vaults is the spiritual home (pun partly intended) of the Scotch Malt Whisky Society and has a really special character all of its own.

It goes without saying that the whisky is excellent - from a bogglingly wide selection of the Society's own single cask, single malt bottlings - and you'll always find something surprising on the shelves. Just as importantly, the staff are amazing - knowledgable without ever being intimidating or condescending and always really enthusiastic to talk with customers and share their passion.  It's not just whisky either - they stock a good selection of beer, wine and soft drinks and the food is great (their chunky chips are particularly fine).

Don't mistake it for its sister facility on Queens Street, which is nice, though not nearly so nice as this. The Queens Street rooms are convenient, but the Vaults encourage you to descend into deep, comfortable couches in front of roaring fires on a windswept winter's night. The walls are tinted in deep, winey tones and the ceilings papered with a curious map of the rich world of whisky. Books, newspapers, and games are scattered about, providing opportunities for quiet activity or soft conversation. In short, the Vaults are the ideal place to warm up and sip a wee dram, outside the tympanic cacophony of the typical watering hole.  The three reviews before mine have pretty much hit the nail on the head regarding the whiskies. Let me just pump the headline: YOU CAN'T GET THESE WHISKIES ANYWHERE ELSE. They are wonderful and they are unique.  As for the food, they do a thin menu of remarkably good pub grub with an upmarket twist: venison burgers, haggis, neeps and tatties (in a whisky sauce of course), usually something nice with fish. The menu changes subtly monthly to pair with each month's latest whiskies. The prices in this regard are very reasonable (even if the whisky is dear), and they have free coffee. There is always one desert on the menu. Options for vegetarians are few, though they always seem to have vegetarian haggis.  The staff are friendly and extremely knowledgeable about wine, whisky, beer and food, as you would expect.  If you can find a member to take you, I encourage even the non-whisky-lovers among you to seek out this haven. And if you are a whisky lover, welcome to Mecca.",

Most major distilleries are expected to produce a signature flavor and so they mix their barrels to achieve this for bottling.  So even if you knew which distillery the whisky came from (all whiskies are numbered rather than include the name of the distillery) it doesn't taste like what you would normally expect.  The Whisky Society bottles up the barrel sells them to their members and once it's gone, it's gone.    We came on a quiet weekday night. They have a full dinner menu which was really good.  I tried the venison burger and hubby had the bangers and mash complete with the Whisky Society's signature sauce, Hotscotch.  We tried about 10 samples of whisky through out dinner, complete with tasting notes and then my husband went to the bar and tried a couple more before coming away with a prized bottle.    If you ever have the opportunity to visit and sample this fine selection of whiskies you must!",

    "text": "We received invitations to attend a whisky tasting here in Reading at the ECMWF where our son works....   We were not sure what to expect but the committee made us very welcome and after a warm introduction, over 50 people of many nationalities who had come, began tasting six whiskys in turn..   We started at 6.30pm and spent a glorious three and a half hours tasting and chatting. chatting and tasting. There were cheese and biscuits and lovely oat cakes to help to absorb the powerful liquids. and of course bottled water to dilute the high alcoholcontent.   We had been given a four-page booklet which related how we should test and appreciate each sample (which was a nice BIG sample) and suggested what we might taste and smell..... Dogs Hair, peaches, ginger snaps, vanilla, figs, leather gloves, apple sausages, cinder toffee, cherry Tunes, honey, Stollen cake were just a few of the experiences for which we should be looking.   The booklet also told us in depth about each whisky and where they originated and how old they were.   At the end, the whisky left over was raffled off and to crown a very good evening my wife won second prize and I won sixth prize.   The prize bottles were almost half full and once we were home I looked it all up on my computer. Together we won more than a total of 60 of beautiful Malt Whisky which we will be happy to drink over the coming cold months !   Our thanks to the Reading Branch of the SMWS for a very entertaining and rewarding evening.   I slept in until 11AM the day after, but did not have a headache !!!   Oh by the way we left the car and got a taxi home !!",

    "text": "If you love single malt whisky, and you are in the UK, then you owe it to yourself to visit the Scottish Malt Whiskey Society.  1. Amazing selection of top whiskys 2. A fair price on the whiskys 3. Sample at your leisure 4. Buy (several) bottles to bring home with you  All the while, enjoy the ambience of this low key and comfortable establishment.  I shared an absolutely lovely evening here with new friends.  I cannot recommend this place enough.  Admittedly, I did not partake of the food although the prices on the menu looked more than reasonable.  For me, it was all about the malt whisky.",

    "text": "The Vaults are, to the best of my knowledge, the original home of the SMWS, and are still the prettiest of their tasting rooms. A large dark wood room, with dark red walls and a ceiling cartooned with a history of the society, it's an excellent place to have a sit down in at pretty much any time of day.   They do rather good food, moving from sandwiches and cakes through to full dinners, but all without too much pretentiousness, as well as a good range of beer and wine, with tea and coffee on the side.   Oh yes, they also have one of the finest range of single barrel malt whiskies you will ever find - every one an individual that you will most probably never find the like of again.   It is a members only club, but with two locations in Edinburgh (The Vaults also having some flats rentable my members for rather reasonable rates) and one in London, as well as a rather decent whisky mail ordering service it can be worth the money to join.",
