    "text": "I have only collected take away food from this restaurant so I can't comment on the serving experience. It's True that every few months I see new faces (assistant waitresses mainly), but the Indian/Pakistani guys seem regular to me. It's considered a busy place, very spacious and the customers' origins vary.    Now, about the take away food. I've tried all their Biryani dishes and they're mouth watering!! If you live close by, it's better to grab the food and go home to enjoy it, as the price difference is considerable!! For example lamb biryani and peshwari naan bread for 10! A friend of mine tried a spicy lamb dish and he loved it (he's a curry expert with his friends trying different restaurant almost per month for years in Edinburgh). Their paratha bread is also great - lighter in the stomach compared to the naan bread!   It's easy to give them a call and order the food. What I found unexpected is that you will get text promotions on your mobile phone every two months or so and there's no obvious option to unsubscribe. I never opted in, so they seem to take it for granted when you make a phone order, I do believe though if you give them a call they should be able to remove you from the list.   Their punctuality is not the best when ordering take away: they don't check always how busy is the kitchen, and they mention fixed time 20 mins or so, but if you show up earlier, your order might be ready.   Oh, and they accept card payments for less than 10 without any extra charge.   Looking forward to trying more dishes and the thrill of the grill!!!",

Aside from arriving 2 1/2 hours from order time, all of the food was delivered cold, and the items at the bottom of the bag were crushed resulting in ruined curry and bread - a guest's meal whose dinner was ruined. While a partial refund was given (only 10 from the restaurant, 15 from JustEat) it was only given with much persistence when the fault lay entirely on the restaurant. There are plenty curry places that will deliver hot and quickly, and I won't waste my time or money at Kebabish again.",

When it finally came it was just fine - nothing to write home about - and I was completely underwhelmed.   At one point we asked a waitress how much longer it would be for food. No joke, she shrugged her shoulders and said \"I don't know\" and that was it! She didn't apologise, check with the kitchen, ask us if we wanted another drink, anything. I burst out laughing at her behaviour and the guys on the table next to us started a chat about how long they'd been waiting too, haha.   Was given a hokey excuse about the restaurant being understaffed at the end of the meal (after we tried to pay and had to wait another ten minutes), but honestly the food was expensive for what it was and experience very poor. Why bother going back again when so many other fantastic Indian restaurants in Edinburgh?   Fail, Kebabish. FAIL.",

    "text": "What's this? Yet another review of something within spitting distance of your house Chris?! Quelle surprise!  Get over it. It's happening.  Sure enough, Kebabish is situated not two minutes from my house on Dalry Road, and if I wasn't spoiled enough already with the likes of Chop Chop and Sushiya a mere stone's throw away (amongst many other fine places), there's now another place to add to the list. That's right, Kebabish was surprisingly top notch.  We were met, seated and made our order with no fuss or bother and the food arrived pretty quickly too. Fun times!  So the food itself... my bud had the chicken wings for starters. They were amongst the finest chicken wings  I've ever had in a restaurant. Fact. I went for the quail (more for the novelty than anything) and for those who've not had quail... meh, it's alright I guess. This is purely down to a consequence of the meat itself and not the cooking or presentation of it - it was cooked well and has quite a satisfying meaty taste, there's just not much of it. I would have much rather had the wings...  For mains we both went for Karahis, I got the chicken and he got the lamb. Mine was better. For the uninitiated, a Karahi is a cooking pot which is used in the preparation of the dish - just so you know... (EDUCATIONAL REVIEWS!) The dishes themselves were mightily tasty with a nice mix of spice and flavour  - not bland and hot like many other curries, really quite delicate whilst potent. Oh hello ginger, thanks for that flavour explosion in my mouth! (I love ginger) - accompaniments in the form of rice and naan were satisfying but somewhat short of being noteworthy.  And hey, how could we not at least give mention to BYOB with no corkage. Simply brilliant.  The fly in the ointment and the reason for four stars in place of five? Well firstly the lamb in the Karahi was a little tough and (although still quite tasty) hadn't been cooked anywhere long enough to let it come close to being as good as the chicken. Secondly... 4.90 for two popadoms and dips?!  I even went and checked online to make sure we hadn't been jipped and True enough there it is plain as day... As someone who has frequented curry houses since youth I have never in my days seen that kind of disproportionate pricing.   But hey, don't buy the pops and you're in for a treat.",

As long as you stick to the kebabs.  And what kebabs they are. Stuck on a charcoal grill often right in front of you, the proper barbeque taste is nothing short of fantastic, the salad is fresh, and if you avoid the doner, a few of the grilled varieties probably aren't all that bad for your health either.  Having only tried a curry once, it wasn't at the same level, but the kebabs are what it's all about, what they want you to experience, so grumbling about that would be like going to Pizza Hut and complaining that the pasta is shite, which it is.  Fantastic for kebabs, and with their rapid expansion, a testament to good old free market economics.",

This means that however fussy one of your mates are, they are sure to find something that tickles their fancy. From the outside Kebabish Original looks really trendy and modern with huge panel windows and inside this theme is continued and offers a really cool, trendy place to dine. I came here with a few friends after a game of laser quest, which is just down the road and I ordered a kebab, as I thought this would be the safest bet as the name of the restaurant suggests this is their speciality. I was right and the kebab tasted fantastic, and there is no comparison between the greasy kebabs I have become used to from cheap takeaways to this well seasoned one. My friends weren't as complimentary about the food however, saying that their curries tasted greasy, so I would therefore say that if you do come here, that you go for the kebabs.",

First of all, I have to agree with the below reviewer. Our table was slightly dirty. The restaurant itself was cold and although the waiter was very helpful to the point of nervousness, I can't say I was too impressed with the food. I mean, it was okay but nothing too spectacular. Maybe it's because it was a weekday evening but there wasn't much atmosphere either.   I highly doubt I'll be back but I reckon it makes sense as an addition to Dalry road and will probably do well in the area as there's not much else to choose from in the way of mid price range sit in restaurants. I'm guessing they'll do well with the student population on the way home from town, if they open late enough to exploit this market.",

I'd bought a voucher from Groupon and, after hearing mixed reviews about Groupon itself, this was my first time trying a voucher so i was a bit wary. I booked this afternoon and made sure I told them I had a voucher and where it was from. There was no hassle and my table was booked for 8pm.   When we showed up however it was clear that there had been some mistake and whoever had taken the booking either hadn't understood me or had forgotten to write it down. There was no hassle though and after a very short wait we were seated with apologies for delay and the terms of the voucher explained.   After a popadum plate, samosa and pakora starter, korma and passanda main with rice and two naan, all of which were delicious and took some time in choosing from the extensive menu, we were too stuffed for pudding and settled for a mocktail which finished the meal off nicely :o)   It's bring your own bottle without a corkage fee, which is great, because some places are ridiculously expensive just for the use of a corkscrew! The waiting staff were really good, always on hand and if they couldn't answer a question sent someone over who could. The place is clean and well organised, has a nice feel and an open kitchen, which I love because you feel they have nothing to hide.   I'm definitely going back.",

I once had a big argument with a friend about how a chicken kebab isn't actually that unhealthy - grilled chicken on a pitta bread, with salad. \"Yeah but what about the garlic mayo and chilli sauce?\" \"Well yeah, but McDonald's don't put burger sauce on their calorie count, do they?\" 1 - 0 Wallace.  Anyway, the kebabs in this place are excellent. Beautifully seasoned and genuinely tasty, and cooked on a charcoal grill. The salad is actually pretty good too, not just the usual chopped red cabbage (why do kebab shops think this is OK?).   That said, the curries are no where near as good. My friend had a bhuna (obviously, we're Northern) and it had about half an inch of grease laminating the top. The actual curry tasted fine, but he had a slippery face afterwards. Go for the kebabs, nothing else.",

My colleuges and I went here for a quick lunch last week and I can honestly say it was delicious. Almost perfect.  The lunchtime menu is limited, but for two courses at just under 7, it was just right. I had some lovely chicken pakora, very moist and crispy, delicious with some spicy pakora sauce and a little (and for me, always unnecessary) salad.   Main was a butter chicken curry, which I'm pretty sure had about two weeks worth of calories in there. It came with plenty of rice and it was absolutely delicious. It wasn't a full sized portion, but a very comfortable size for lunch.   We only had soft drinks, but the restaurant has a BYOB policy and the last time I checked, corkage was free! You could have one of their 'Mocktails' though...alcohol free cocktails which sound lovely!

Mmmmmmm!  From its quite trendy decor to the very attentive staff it was super all round. I had the sheek kebab to start - 2 large, flavoursome and piping hot pieces of yumminess, and Husband had malai boti chicken - which was a lot of meat for a starter. Our waiter was very knowledgeable, as I had queried what was the hotter of two main dishes, and he suggested I order the North Indian Chilli Garlic lamb with great flavours but get it vindaloo hot. Husband had Lamb Jhalfrezi which was succulent and rich - he mentioned how tender the meat was. There's a mixed grill which sounds amazing (the boys at work had it) which is a huge pot of chops, steaks and other carnivorous delights.  Even better: it's a BYO with a Co-Op next door so three bottles of San Miguel for 6 was all we splashed for drinks. Service was brisk but not rushed and you see the chefs behind glass. Highly recommended hence 5*.",
