    "text": "Bar @ JMCC is certainly not the first place one might think of when considering where to go for dinner, but the food is surprisingly good. Like most bars, burgers make up a significant part of the menu. The portions are quite large, and the prices are good too. For food, I have little negative to say.  Unfortunately, the bar lacks any atmosphere at all. I don't know if they are trying hard to attract in the huge student population in Pollock Halls, but as far as I can see, they are not succeeding.There is a pool table, and a television for sports matches, but it's unfortunate that there is never a crowd in here.  Overall, food good, drinks prices okay, atmosphere lacking.",

The food is a-okay, and there's a decent selection for an on-campus bar, but it's nothing out of this world.  The staff are very friendly and nice, and I like the atmosphere.  There are pubs with better food in Edinburgh, but you can't beat this location if you live in Pollock Halls.",

    "text": "When I arrived at the Edinburgh University catered halls of residence, I was surprised to learn they had a license to sell alcohol on the premises, and furthermore had also had a bar to do it in!   Adjoined to the catering facility, the John McIntyre Centre bar was a convenient place to grab a meal if we felt too lazy to venture into town, or go grab a pint and hang out with your friends. One of the bar's greatest attributes is its cheap alcohol.. a pint of beer was just a 1 and I hope it stays that way for the new batch of students!  The entire JMC building underwent an 8 million refurbishment in 2009, so the bar is fully decked out with nice furniture and a HUGE flat screen tv; I've got memories of watching the British craze the X-Factor in there!   While most of the food served here (paninis, bagels and salads) is passable, I'd recommend the University Library Bar instead, as the menu is pretty much identical and the meals are of better quality.  During the semester time, great for students, but unless you're taking a day trip to Arthur's Seat, anyone else would seem out of place!",

    "text": "I've never been a fan of the JMC bar, I have never liked the atmosphere- the music inside was never upbeat and happy and did not get you in the right vibe for going out. I think that the clientele the bar is trying to attract is a student that enjoys a political debate with a few chums over a quiet pint. There is a time and a place for that, and I don't think it should be in a freshers bar, this is why I always went to The Crags pub where it was possible to listen to some good music in the company of people who were going to hit the town.  The prices were always reasonable and I did go there a few times during my stay at Pollock, and the pub quiz night was always fun. I would only go to the JMC bar for its convenience, but wouldn't go there in preparation for a night out or more than a quick pint.",
