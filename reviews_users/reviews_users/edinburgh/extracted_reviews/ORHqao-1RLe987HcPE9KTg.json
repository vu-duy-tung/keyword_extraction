    "text": "Great wee Bangladeshi & Indian takeaway situated on London Road. The guy (presumably the owner) who serves you is really polite and friendly every time and he even holds the door open for you. I'm happy to say that I've never had a below standard curry from them yet, but unfortunately the breads are kind of average.   It's the only place I go for a takeaway curry in Edinburgh.",

    "text": "We got the House Thali combo (3 mains, 1 veg, 1 starter, rice, and naan) for 24.95, and it provides good bang for the buck, err, pound.  And for the various dishes, you can really taste the component ingredients, especially the almond and cashews used in the sauces.  So I really wanted to rate this place better, except for a couple of things.  The Lamb Chops and the Tandoori Mixed Grill were overdone -- from slightly dry to very dead.  And, for the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Lamb Pasanda, the sauces were very sweet.  For the Lamb Pasanda in particular, it was sweet enough that I mistook it for a dessert until I came across the chunks of lamb.  Hard to really knock them much on the first point since it's all takeaway and maybe there's some extra cooking while the food is sealed in a box, but for the second I would've expected the dishes to be more savory than sweet.  Overall, not bad, and potentially really good curries, but maybe too sweet for my taste.",
