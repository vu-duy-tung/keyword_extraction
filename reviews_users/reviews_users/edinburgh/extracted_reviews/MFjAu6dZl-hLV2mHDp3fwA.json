    "text": "To dodge a really heavy rain shower I popped into the Castello coffee on Castle Street, which was by now almost full. Being around 5.30pm, so near to closing time had to make this initial visit brief, but its seems so much brighter and airier on the inside than the alternative chains just around the block.  Its cosy, has a few seats dotted around the walls and is just wide enough to fit a couple of tables. Additional high stools placed under marble worktops, great for positioning a laptop/tablet. Decked with creamy walls, Walnut countertop and black worktops abd industrial styled lighting you'd possibly think this was an extension to the office kitchen? Maybe it is, for the city workers located above in the office block cornering Princes Street.  Castello's feel seems takeaway but essentially it serves brekkie through to late lunch. That includes tea, coffee panini, soup and a selection of cakes, (gf?), they may do other seasonal foods or salads, however didn't see anyone else eat these. Since they had run out of Sweet potato chilli soup, my second choice was to try Soy Cappuccino and what cake remained of the day, Seeded Banana, which was  moist, not to heavy, just right for time of day.  Run by a couple of guys, and to my surprise have occupied the premises for 13 months, means upon stepping through the cafe door you feel a distinct chilled vibe to the place. Maybe it was down to the nice music they were playing like you might find on Triple JJJ radio, or the movie Garden State you know the type - surf styled music lots of guitars and drums, real instruments.   Castello to sit in, well unless you had great company to chat to, or a laptop, it may need some focal point, newspapers or periodicals to make you want to stay longer, rather than just an open door. I could make a suggestion - someone who used to have a taxi firm in Haddington kept a Piranha with a 10 at the bottom of the tank, with a sign stating \"its yours if your brave enough.\"  Best thing is...they make dam fine coffee!",

It is very easy to find, just off Princes Street. And it was not busy at all yesterday, with just one other table occupied.  The hot chocolate that I had was divine. Foamy, creamy and not too sweet. It did not need all the whipped cream and marshmallows that other cafes have. It had a really beautiful foam decoration, which I actually think made it taste better!  We also tried the chocolate brownie and raspberry and white chocolate slice. Both were delicious, but the brownie was especially good.  It is very small though, with two tables and a bench inside and about five tables outside. The size also means that there is a lack of a toilet which can be slightly annoying. The nearest one is on the top floor of Debenhams on Princes Street.  Another bonus is free wifi!",

They use Allpress Espresso beans; it's nice to have something a bit different from the usual options and I've always been impressed by it. The staff are always very friendly and laid back.  From the outside you wouldn't necessarily think it was a 'serious' coffee place. It doesn't have exposed lightbulbs and distressed wooden furniture instead going for something simple, bright and clean which makes for a nice change. In the best possible way it's more like somewhere you could take your Mum who might not feel at home in hipster surroundings of Artisan or BrewLab.  It's great as a place for a quick bite at lunch; or in my case a quiet break from Christmas shopping with a flat white and croissant. The soup and sandwiches I've had in here in the past have always been high quality.   It is small however, particularly when the weather means sitting outside isn't going to be fun, as there are limited seats inside. It's not necessarily somewhere I come and plan to sit reading and drinking for an extended time, but as a place for a relaxed coffee break or lunch it's ideal.",

    "text": "FOOD 4 // AMBIANCE 4 // SERVICE 4  Stopped by here with the intention of getting a coffee and scone, but ended up getting soup for lunch, a baked good and a coffee... typical.   First off, this does not look like a small, cozy, family owned cafe from the outside -- it definitely looks like it is a more established brand but, the second you step in and see there are only two people working the counter, the old cafe charm is back! When I stopped by in the late afternoon, many of the sandwiches were gone but they did have a parsnip and pear soup available. PARSNIP and PEAR ... I had to try it! It came with two bread halves (and the bread was all crusty and perfect for dipping in the soup). The soup itself was so FLAVORFUL! I imagined a bland, sweeter soup but this was 100% seasoned (there was a spicy kick in the back) and super savory. VERY GOOD!   The Cappuccino I got was good -- not the best I have had but the espresso they used had a different flavor profile to it which was interesting. It was pretty good! The carrot cake I got was delicious! Very cozy and just full of cinnamon and shred of carrot. It was a bit dense and dry but just a little. The frosting on it was FIRE!!   Now-- the VIEW is amazing here. I sat outside and was not only able to people watch, but also get a magnificent view of the castle!! so, so wonderful.   The service was very friendly and the barista was super smiley -- always a great treat!",

It doesn't look like much from the outside - but this little spot serves up delicious, well-made coffee and great food. Not many seats - but enough if you want a quick bit and a coffee. They use All Press, which is a New Zealand coffee, via Shoreditch  in London. I drink soy, and they use Bonsoy, so that is a big plus for me that they can make a fantastic soy flat white every time. We generally can't help ourselves and have to order 2 each when there.  They also have a delicious soup on offer, last time it was sweet potato and chili and generally they are always veggie/dairy free, served with nice homemade bread. They also have sandwiches, an avocado and chickpea salad has been there the past few times and is very fresh and tasty. They serve pastries from Leo's Beanery, so good cakes are always on offer. It isn't a flash, hip place, but that is what makes it even better. Nothing pretentious, just good coffee, fresh/healthy food and good service. Sad I didn't try to this place for so long!  It is located on the end of Princes Street, which is nice, not many coffee places around there that aren't chains.",

Another major strong point is their soup, which is served in interesting flavours and generous portions and is great value for what you get.  Service is very good: courteous, and enthusiastic. Setting is ok. It strikes me as mainly a take-out place due to limited seating, but don't get me wrong it's perfectly pleasant, and if weather permits there is outdoor seating with a magnificent view of the Caste.  What I love about this place is that its stretch of Castle Street is drowning in food chains - Costa, Starbucks, Pret and TGI Fridays are all a stone's throw away - but in my opinion Castello is by far the best cup of coffee.",
