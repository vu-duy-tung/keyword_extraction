    "text": "DESPITE OUR LOVE of Indian food, Sarah and I are guilty of not branching out in search of rivals to our much-loved regulars Rivage and Desi Pakwan.  Then again, when you know the food is always going to be top notch, why would you take this risk? Today presented an opportunity to take us out of our spice comfort zone when a trip to Voujon in Newington was arranged.  I have to admit I knew very little about this eatery but remember reading a review by my blogger friends The Edinburgers (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.edinburgers.co.uk%2F&s=8f4ef4ca8e860ad86fe7650f8be6ce9a94525b684ca2e0af63354728a09edff9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">edinburgers.co.uk</a>) earlier in the year.  Newington itself isn't our normal turf, either, but there's always a buzz around the area to suggest this part of town demands further exploration.  The weather couldn't be much worse on this Friday evening and you can feel the city starting to swell with the Festival looming.  Traffic is busier, tourists are confused by the 1.60 bus fare payment and so holding everyone up, waves of colourful posters are everywhere ... yip, August is near.  It was worth noting that the waiting staff were smartly dressed as we trudged in from the rain in need of nourishment.  The dining room was full with what I judged to be a mix of locals, tourists and students, as well as a busy takeaway trade going on, so best to get down to business quickly.  The menu showcased an extensive range of meat, fish and vegetarian dishes. The usual classics were in there alongside an interesting range of kebabs, specials and fusion dishes.   I was tempted by the veggie starter voll puri (3.75) (lightly spiced chickpeas and potatoes with poori from Calcutta), but went for the more lavish butterflied king prawns (7.95), that the menu described as 'striking and delicious'. When it arrived the two large breadcrumbed prawns certainly had my attention. I found the prawns were beautifully tender and the coating suitably crisp with a tasty yellow sauce that had a pleasant fruity tang to it. This was certainly delicious , but could have done with a chilli sauce or some spice to deliver the striking part.   Sarah's starter of Khati kebab (5.95) had a little more character to it. Little flecks of tandoori chicken and well-cooked vegetables mixed with an evenly balanced mix of spices inside a light, toasty-flavoured roti, and a fresh side salad impressed.  This was a mammoth portion, too, but again could have benefited from the addition of a sauce just to elevate it to another level.  I was glad Sarah ordered the North Indian garlic chilli chicken (9.95) because it's my go-to Indian main course, but I thought I'd branch out, opting for the Khatmandu chicken delicacy (9.95).  An intriguing name to say the least, it consists of chicken tikka kebabs with whole spring onions, cinnamon, lentils and fresh herbs that form a spicy sauce. Sounds good.  I have to say this was an excellent curry.  Lentils can easily go to mush in these sort of dishes but the texture was still there, and complimented the juicy chicken tikka.  Cinnamon can be another potential downfall, but it was subtle in this instance and really contributed to the dish.  In fact, I love it with lamb as well.  I do like a bit of heat and this did pack a punch as promised. Bravo.  I was eager to try Sarah's main and the stench of garlic radiating from it was impressive.  The chicken was tender and it had a pleasing heat to it with flavourful, fresh whole green chillis bringing tang and welcome texture.  The only downside here was a slight bitter taste, which meant it didn't quite match the exquisiteness of my dish. 1-1 on the doors.  We shared rice in the form of ghee bhat (2.65) and a side of saag aloo priced at 3.95), and as if there wasn't enough garlic, yes, a garlic naan. The latter was one of the best naans we've tasted.  It was so light it would have floated like a feather. The rice was a little different and I liked the texture and oniony vibes the allium brought to it. The saag aloo offered irony spinach that flirted with soft, lightly spiced spuds - delicious.  The waiters were exceptionally polite, hard-working and humble. Their product knowledge was as impressive as the pride they took in their work, and service was impeccable throughout the evening.  I've had far worse service in fine dining restaurants, so credit where credit is due.  Voujon was certainly worth the venture out into the horrendous weather.  My Khatmandu chicken delicacy and that garlic naan will stick in the memory for a while, but as to whether it rivals our trusted local eateries, further visits are required to inspect levels of consistency. There were plenty of positives to merit a return visit and the excellent service rounded off an enjoyable evening.",

    "text": "This place promises a lot; apart from anything else it's refreshing to find an Indian resturant close to the city centre which isn't full of rowdy groups lured in by the cheap food and Bring Your Own Bottle policy. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite deliver everything it promises.  There's no denying that the decor is beautiful - the solid oak furniture and linen tablecloths certainly give the place an upmarket feel, but when main courses are  around 10-15 without any rice or naans you would expect something more from the food than it actually delivers.  That said, they offer a handful of set banquets for two people which work out at roughly 20 per head including starters right through to main courses, although my friends that I ate there with said that theirs was pretty bland and dull.  I wouldn't go as far as saying it was a bad meal, but I haven't been in a mad rush to go back to Voujon since my first visit.",

Dont let these fool you though, Voujon isnt as great as it claims.  The 'modern' cooking is uninspiring, and totally lacking the flavours that traditional Indian food would deliver in an instant. This pretty much described the dissapointment we felt for the whole meal - lacking that certain something, the punch as it were. The food generally tasted like something you could buy from a supermarket, but was way more expensive.  However, Voujon has some redeeming features - the restaurant is beautifully modern and elegant - and the staff were helpful.  Overall, Voujon was a dissapointment - and I doubt Voujon will post this review in its window.",

The decor feels modern, fresh and clean with plenty of neatly laid out tables and really comfortable seats.  The staff are attentive, friendly and know everything about the menu which always helps when you have no idea what to expect from a certain dish. I went for the tandoori chicken kebabs with rice which didn't take long to arrive, but tasted a litle dry.  The salad it was served with was fresh and there were some great flavours going on, yet it was just lacking some sauce.   I'd probably come to Voujon agai, but I just expected a little more from the food.",

They serve traditional and authentic Indian dishes which are full of flavour. I have had a few of their curry dishes and my favourite is the King Prawn Bhuna which is very tasty and quite spicy but not too much that it ruins your meal.   The dishes at Voujon are all very well presented and the foo is reasonably priced, with main meals around 9 and there is an extensive veggie menu available as well. They offer several different types of rice and there is plenty of variety of side dishes to accompany your meal. The decor inside is very authentic and modern whilst the staff have always been very attentive and warm.  Voujon also do takeaways and is available for private functions.",

Can't fault the place at all. There was 8 of us in our group, and nearly all of us got something different, and nobody faulted their meal at all. They also do take away and set meals during the day for a very cheap and reasonable price. This is highly recommended!!!",

The Boti kebab starter was 5 stars, so I eagerly anticipated my main course of chilli garlic chicken. I eat in a lot of indian restaurants and sadly this dish didn't deliver. It had flavour but a bland appearance. Don't get me wrong, it was by no means awful but didn't live up to the standards of the starter. Food and it's taste are very subjective, judging by how busy the place got I guess I just chose wrong on the night. In summary, enjoyable but not memorable. I'll give it 3.5 stars but that shows as 4!",
