It is veggie food but is expensive for what it is and quite bland and served in a way that is reminiscent of a school canteen. On a weekday lunchtime there will be a sea of grey hair as they purchase their ratatouilles and baked potatoes and broccoli bakes, the tables are close together and it can be really hard to find a seat at times.  I am not really sure what it wants to be. There is something about food that is dished out in this way that makes me think it isn't really a proper restaurant - wandering about with a tray looking for a seat really does give me high school flashbacks so it really isn't for me. But mum loves it.",

The quality of food is quite good and I enjoyed eating there despite being somewhat of a carnivore! The prices are reasonably expensive for the portions they give you (although cheaper than places along George Street) but that I can only assume is due to the fact the restaurant is in the centre of town and the rates must be very high.   The main complaint I would have is that the restaurant is some what lacking in quality seating and there is a 'rough and ready' feel to it. I would not go if I was not eating with a vegetarian or needed to eat healthily but it is a nice place to eat in the city centre.",

It's still a good place for vegetarians, and one of the few places to take vegan friends. But for my money it hasn't quite moved enough with the times: it still feels a bit basic and cafe-like (you collect a tray and go up to the counter), and the prices are a little high for what you get. But it is reliable, the ingredients are always fresh, and the array of salads is impressive. A better bet for lunch in my view.   They've recently revamped the bistro next door, which offers a more upmarket dining experience with modern decor, though I have not eaten here. They are open on Sundays, albeit closing at 22h. What is it with veggie places and early closing?",

    "text": "Like a well rehearsed theatrical production, I decided for fun to break my late lunchtime into an ensemble of bites.  Act1: Quest. Tasty broth, pretty looking using real tomatoes for their soup and an assorment of chunky veggies, coupled with large slices of malty wholemeal type bread. I realised I'd achieved nirvana towards enjoying a fat free low calorie starter; alas, it didn't last...Feeling fresh like I'd just driven an ocean road on a sunny day in a fast car, positive by now and half full, thanks Henderson's, I moved onto another dish in my lunch quest.  ActII: Deathly Chocolate. I had not consumed much sweet stuff in the last week, so my weakness was to follow tummy over head by ordering a smooth sweet and yet delightful yummy chocolate coffee cup cake with last of the summer fruits on-top. Wow, intense sinning levels - this was actually served in a cup topped with calorie bust'n dollop of fresh cream. This got me thinking had I gone too far, and overloaded calories a result of my sweet tooth taking over?   Finale: Care In the Community. Very thankfully but refreshingly before buttons started a' popping the grand finale, a helpful wash down of coffee, ooh nectar in a china container. Service was excellent as usual and it seemed I'd missed lunch rush. The veggie options were great, prices not bad, but strangely there were plenty tables remaining? It wasn't too long before an answer presented itself, like a crime drama unfolding...look for the evidence. Is there really an excuse for leaving dishes on most tables for more than half an hour when it's not busy?  Encore: Furry dice they are not. I tried hard not to squish a tomato underfoot when sitting down, failed to catch the fruit-flys buzzing my table, or get comfy on the flat cushions(why bother) but as it was a quick in and out I didn't really mind, as these things happen during a busy day. Did I mention the kittens also left...sorry I lied; there were no kittens. But maybe if there were, then customers would be so busy playing with them they would not notice the dishes...I'm just saying!  I didn't wait around for the standing ovation as was heading for cinema but relished in the fact that it was 5/5 for food options but all else 3/5, with the hope of secretly upping the star value next visit. Kittens would have been cute though if impractable?",

    "text": "I won't deny that Hendersons is an Edinburgh institution. It was the first specially vegetarian restaurant in Edinburgh in the 70s, at a time when people were beginning to become aware of it. Despite the mainstream disapproval of vegetarianism this place was really trendy, and still rides on its fame from the good old days.  We are lucky to have the number of vegetarian restaurants in Edinburgh that we do today. This, however, means more competition for Hendersons. Nonetheless it still remains probably the best known.  I have mixed feelings about Hendersons however. On one hand it provides a great variety of generally good quality vegetarian food, on the other its pricey for what you pay for and the menu never really seems to change. It's a great shame that some of the other criticisms here have confused some generally bad experiences that could have happened at any restaurant, with the fact this restaurant just happens to be vegetarian. It's clearly fallacious to say that just because your cake wasn't creamy enough vegetarian restaurants must disapprove of creamy cakes. Any restaurant could serve you a disappointing flapjack. It reminds me of the sort of arguments you here from intolerant travellers when they are abroad and don't like something they've been served or whatever and equate it with something necessary about the culture or the people.  That aside Hendersons does have it downside. I love their chickpea and tomato stew, but it's not that special, it's something I cook all the time and don't expect to pay 6 for it. I love their crusty bread with curry, but could they change it around more often? I find Hendersons can be too expensive for simple dishes that seem to always be the same (albeit from a great range). On the former point I sometimes feel that Hendersons now caters mostly for the New Town residents, perhaps the rebellious youth of the 70s now all grown up and able to afford it. They do offer a student discount however.  But now let me defend Hendersons and say that the quality of the food, both nutritionally and taste wise, is still high above the average, and unlike most pubs or standard Italian restaurants, I don't feel like I owe my body an apology after eating there. I don't think that a slab of flesh maketh a meal (considering our bodies aren't made to eat meat with every meal and that 6-7% of the worlds population live without meat, through choice or circumstance, this claim seems ridiculous).  I think to claim that Hendersons is a place that can be \"okay for some lifestyles but not for me really\" or \"not really my thing cos I eat meat\" is a claim from someone who hasn't tried the range of dishes available here, or has some problematic addiction to one particular food group (besides presumably these people don't literally eat meat with every single meal: breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacking- or they probably don't have much longer to live). Again, you might not like Hendersons because they are rude or the dishes are cold or you thought the curry tasted crap, but the mere absence of meat in a place surely does not make it a pleasure only for the select few.  Incidentally Hendersons is not unfriendly, the dishes aren't cold and nearly all the dishes I've tried (quite a number) have tasted very nice.  A great vegetarian institution that still remains a great option despite some setbacks.",

Then a local told me that Henderson's is the place to go.  Not only is it vegetarian, but they have a veggie version of haggis that supposedly tastes \"just like the real thing.\"    So, we went there and it was fabulous.  It's a small-ish place, but everything was flavorful and just what our starving bellies needed.  Oh, and yes, I got the veggie haggis.  Totally awesome and filling.  I think the texture was nothing like the real thing, but at least now I know what haggis is \"supposed\" to taste like.    Friendly staff, great food.  What more can you ask for?  Don't even hesitate if you're a carnivore.  You'll be more than satisfied and you'll probably leave with a whole new appreciation of vegetarian food.",

And I will keep it brief, as there isn't any need for me to reword other people's comments on the vegetarian-organic philosophy or the quality of the food.  The only thing I thought would be worth mentioning is the atmosphere - there aren't many places I've been which have the same relaxed, friendly and unpretentious feel as Henderson's. The staff are generally very nice, the decor is cool but also endearingly shabby and, most importantly, they support local art and music.  Granted, this isn't by any means a priority for everyone, and it's very probable that it's partially responsible for their relatively high prices, but I think that especially in the current atmosphere of frugality it is something equally individual and equally worthy of celebration as their cooking.",

    "text": "I actually came to Henderson's to have a look at the shop, a kind of Peckhams style deli which sells the best in organic farm produce, very refreshing to see in amongst so many commercial restaurants and boozers!  The restaurant was actually shut when we visited but we made good use of the deli, buying a couple of organic chicken salad rolls and a yummy pastry which was super sweet and delicious. I love the layout of the store, the smells and the sights..all of the food looks, well, good enough to eat. As well as the deli counter, they also sell tinned goods, healthy ready meals and freshly baked bread and cakes, which are to die for.  A lovely little deli-shop, perfect for a healthy choice in Edinburgh.",

    "text": "There are many things I miss about not living in Edinburgh anymore, and Henderson's has to be right at the top of that list.  The food is usually good, often excellent, and the prices are far from unreasonable.  I have to say I prefer eating in the Bistro rather than the main restaurant downstairs as it has a warmer atmosphere, though you're paying a little more for your meal there.  The best part about it is that there is enough variety and flavour to please most non-vegetarians.  I've taken my mother and sisters there, my mother-in-law and my father, all of whom love their meat, but they've enjoyed the food.  Yes, I'm sure they would have preferred a nice steak, but while they might have gone in there a little apprehensive they came out satisfied and with no reservations about returning.  The shop is a little pricy, but let's face it, if you're vegetarian or vegan you're penalised wherever you go.  If you don't want to eat meat but still want a varied diet, you're going to have to pay for it.  The prices are comparable, or even cheaper, than the other main vegetarian stores in the city and the quality is always excellent.  This place holds a special place in my heart as it is where I took my wife for our first proper date, where I proposed to her and where we had our wedding reception, but that doesn't blind me to its imperfections.  Getting down the stairs to the toilets from the Bistro is a nerve-wracking experience, the main restaurant downstairs is often crowded and sometimes the staff can be a little hit and miss, particularly the younger workers.  However, its imperfections are far outweighed by the quality of the food and the general ambiance.",

    "text": "Hendersons is my favorite restaurant in the UK--and I went to a LOT when living there for two years.  It actually has three sections, each with a unique atmosphere and decor: the restaurant, which is a bit fancier than the other two parts--this is great for date night; the cafe, which is great for breakfast; and the bistro, which has a cabin-like feel, which is perfect for dinner and for listening to live music, which they have almost every night.  The food itself is phenomenal.  The menu is almost entirely vegetarian, and each dish has an original flavor, interesting textures, and a great combination of ingredients.  The lasagne is wonderful, the salads are crisp and refreshing, the soup comforting, and the tofu-sweet potato dish is my favorite.  Plus, the desserts are to-die-for: rich chocolate mousse, chocolate-hazelnut cake, fruit tarts, just to name a few.  Definitely seek out Hendersons if you're ever in Edinburgh.  It's a wonderful experience, and a great way to get a taste of Scottish cuisine without the meat.",

I have only eaten in the deli, but every time has been a pleasant experience. The soup is really tasty, and there are 3 options a day, which spices up life a bit. I have have morrocan tangine flavour, spicy lentil dal, red pepper, and many other flavours. I usually get it with bread, and there is a choice of seeded roles,  wholemeal, white, sourdough, oatmeal, cheeese scones, and probably some seasonal special. There is a deli counter with lots of ready to cook food made at Hendersons, like lasagna, savoury filled crepes, quiche and so on. I have heard from multiple sources that the vegan cherry pie is very good too.  After finishing your lunch, you may be tempted to look around the shop. It's a haven for those with allergies beside vegetarians; I saw many gluten and dairy free products, including chocolate and cookies. The fridges are well stocked up with pre-made sandwiches, salads, sushi, and a few locally made cakes.  This is a really lovely central place, and I end up going here if I find myself faint after a few hours of shopping.",

Cozy, unpretentious, caring, and with its heart in the right place-- we were impressed to discover that this vegetarian restaurant has been around for over 50 years! Descending the staircase to walk into the restaurant, you feel like you are tapping into an underground secret realm that feels like a cross between a family home and an inn...The food was really fun and delicious and that flavor was all the more enhanced by the warmth emanating from both the waiters and clientele of locals and visitors alike getting overflowing plates of lovely food. It was a joy watching little old Scottish ladies out to lunch with their friends eating healthy and earth conscious food ;) But our very favorite moment was when we came back for dinner to try their vegan haggis--which is something so sublime I will never forget it! This, coupled with Herderson's live pianist serenading us to Saint-Saens, Ravel, and Bach... make this place one of my most memorable culinary experiences  Thank you for all you do, we will surely be back again!",

    "text": "Oh, my heart hath such conflict! When my hubs and I, both long-time vegetarians, happened to amble past Henderson's I leapt at the chance to finally scope this vegetarian restaurant out. From the exterior Henderson's looked cute enough, and anything claiming to serve veggie foodstuffs warrants a snoop in my book. However, Henderson's was not exactly what I had been expecting.  I'll admit from the get-go that a lot of my confusion comes from not knowing what exactly Henderson's was. First of all, when we ventured inside we walked past a sign that offered table service during a certain window of time. When we got inside to see that there was a buffet-style ordering line just inside, we were unsure what to do: wait to be seated, or order first, or what? As there didn't seem to be any table service happening, and no one guiding folk to seats, we decided on snagging a table first. No problems there--there was plenty of tables to chose from, although some were a bit big for just the two of us. We grabbed one and then approached the ordering line. As there's not much room to stand, we had only perused the menu a few seconds before the girl behind the counter chirped, \"Ready to order?\" That along with the people waiting behind us lead us to clumsily choosing something on the spot, being given a small wooden spoon to mark our table (cute), then moving on down the line to what we assumed was the checkout. The drinks at the end of the line were displayed, but we didn't have much time to dawdle there either before another (somewhat brusque) girl accepted our payment. I ended up coming back to snag drinks moments later. Again, maybe I can chalk feeling rushed up to my not knowing what the heck I was doing in Henderson's, but there it is.  By the time I'd returned to my table with drinks (two for over 5 pounds--a bit dear!), the food had magically arrived--surprisingly quickly! And happy I was to see it, as I was starving! We'd ordered two \"nut burger\" options with potato wedges and garlic mayo. What arrived was a nut loaf with three gigantic potato spears and said mayo. Although I was taken aback by what was not to me a burger at all, I was gratified to find my food was delicious, if dense. Talk about a filling meal! Still, when I found out my husband and I had paid just under 30 pounds for one soup, veggie-nut-not-quite-burgers, and two canned drinks, I was a bit dismayed. You could easily pay just that much for a nicer dining experience than no table service, buffet-style ordering, and veggie food. I'll admit the novelty of finding a yummy veggie restaurant is awesome, but ouch. That one hit the wallet a bit below the belt!  I wasn't left feeling overwhelmingly impressed with Henderson's decor, either. Although the interior is lined with artwork of Edinburgh's skylines and cityscapes (nice), the rest is a bit ramshackle in feel. Sometimes mismatched chairs and tables feels quirky and charming, and other times it feels, well, a little messy. Henderson's felt a bit on that end of the spectrum to me, although it was clean and had plenty of seating available.  I'm definitely glad to have finally experienced a undoubtedly tasty meal at Henderson's. However, if you're looking for a slightly more personal, welcoming atmosphere, I'm not entirely sure that this is the place to get it. I think I should visit Henderson's again to scope out the smaller portions and see how that fits my wallet and tastebuds before making a final assessment, especially when knowing how to properly place an order, but as of right now, I feel disappointingly \"meh\" about the whole experience.",

    "text": "I always make sure to visit Henderson's at least once when I journey to Edinburgh. Eating vegetarian is a nice change and Henderson's does it well.  I normally opt for a portion of whatever vegetable soup they have on that day. The soup and the bread it comes with are both pleasant. If I had to criticise, I think sometimes that the soups are slightly under seasoned, but all the tables have salt and paper so it's nothing you can't sort out yourself.  I am less enthusiastic about their dessert offerings, however. There's nothing offensive about them, they're just not particularly inspiring. You can expect to see cute looking strawberry tartlets and pastries with kiwi fruit and stuff. It all looks perfectly nice through the glass, but when you get it, you find the pastry is a little heavy and it just doesn't match the higher standards that their savoury food sets.  I'd recommend Henderson's for lunch and lunch only. It's ideal for a quick bite to eat for a friend and perhaps something sweet after. The food is not unforgettable, but at the prices Henderson's charges, you don't expect it to be.",

This little shop and deli on Hanover Street offer a variety of options, ranging from soups, salads, spanakopita, quiche to ready made sandwiches.   Most often I opt for a large cup of soup and a roll, and this costs 2.70. There are usually about 3 different soups on offer daily, which is nice as most places have only one or max 2. My favourite is the lentil & apricot soup which probably is also the most flavoursome of the bunch.. Quite often I feel that the soups could benefit of a bit more seasoning, but all in all they do taste quite fresh and healthy. The bread is lovely.. I had a large sunflower seed roll, which definitely beats the ones offered at likes of Sainsbury's etc.   The shop has a large selection of other items as well: coffee, tea, chocolate, jams, crackers, fruit.   A note for those falafel lovers out there: today when I visited the shop there was a notice that they are soon unable to sell falafels (due to a distribution issue).",

On the plus side I must say the food is really excellent  among the very best vegetarian food you could find anywhere, really fresh and totally delicious, with a great amount of choice too. I particularly like the way you can order a smaller portion of a main course in order to have some of those gorgeous salads on the side as well. The staff are lovely, so friendly and helpful  I love their big smiles! I so want to be able to give this place 5 stars because I so loved my meal and will most definitely not leave it another 25 years before eating there again! (Pity 4-and-a-half stars aren't an option) Somy only (minor) gripes are that the blackboards aren't that easy to read and the salads could be labelled. I imagine the staff get very tired of having to explain what everything is. It would also be better if there were waitress service  or a compromise where you order at the counter but they bring it to the table. It's not easy having to carry trays of food around looking for a table when you're already laden with shopping! Apart from that, I would say 'highly recommended' for top quality vegetarian cuisine.",

There is an extensive selection of vegetarian food available here, made with locally sourced, high quality ingredients, and you have a choice of eating in the basement restaurant, the bistro, or taking a quick bite away from the deli. The basement restaurant is probably my favourite part of Hendersons, with its canteen style array of amazing looking salads, specials, soups, and other enticing delights to try. The restaurant is open from breakfast time until the evening, where its laid back dining style and often live music always seems to attract quite a few people.  The bistro part of Hendersons offers a relaxed, pleasant, and slightly more formal a la carte format in cheerful looking surroundings. A visit to the deli is a treat, with a range of yummy looking items, including the usual sandwiches, veggie pizzas, and frittata and falafel.",

So we waited a bit more and after seeing other folk seated and given menus we flagged down another server to ask for menus.

I ordered the nachos which were gluten free, then just omitted the salsa and instead had a delicious bean salsa. It was delicious! Plenty of cheese, sour cream, guac and nacho chips. The freshly squeezed orange juice was really nice and we had a chocolate nut cake for dessert which was nice though it was quite heavy.

I popped in with a friend for lunch oe day, and as we were heading out for a big meal that evening, we decided to just get a handful of starters to share between us, rather than having a full-on lunch.   The food was amazing, and it was also really good value into the bargain which, in my opinion, always makes it even tastier! We got a portion of their Baba Ghanoush, Humus, Tzatziki and Spicy Bean Pate with a load of breads to mop it up, and I can honestly say it was one of the tastiest lunches I've eaten in that price bracket in a long time.",

But it is does happen.  We ended up here as my friend had visited before, for dinner, and had enjoyed it. However I have to say I was not rating this visit. I am not too sure she was either. We went for a wee spot of lunch and I gotta say I have never been soooo confused in my life!? Menu boards all over the place with hot dishes and soups and salads. I was baffled. It was very much canteen style, which I was not overly keen on. Very disorganised and not very well run or thought out. This would work so much better if they just did table service!?  I ended up having a medium salad. I asked and pointed at one of the bowls to ask what it was, the blunt and completely useless reply - Potato salad. Well yes. I can see that. I am familiar with what a potato looks like, but that does not have mayonnaise on it so all I wanted to know was what it had been dressed with. I still have no idea. So I went for that, some chickpea salad and a beetroot salad. A bread Roll and a what was called 'large' smoothie (It was small, and not freshly made as I expected). All this came to almost 9. Which to me, was faaaar too much.  Salad was ok. Not much flavour. Smoothie wasn't fresh and the whole system was just not great. I won't be rushing back. The breakfast menu did however look quite good.",

But goddamn it, it's just so cosy down there and the food just sounds so fresh and healthy and appetising it's surprisingly difficult to turn away once you've been lured down the steps! It's a solid choice for me to take both veggies and omnivores when needing a casual foodstop (/shelter from the weather) in the middle of town. You grab a tray and order along a school canteen style counter, at which point I was dithering over my menu choice so panicked and pointed to the first salad I saw (cue coleslaw overload on the side of my jacket potato). They have a compact but tasty sounding choice of hot dishes, soups and salads, as well as fresh juices and plenty of tempting baked goodies around the till. Despite my panic order our jackets were a nice stodgy energy boost that kept us going well through an afternoon at the fringe (and err associated drinkies). Noteworthily (if that's not a word it should be) clean toilets too!",

My Granny likes it here after she took my vegetarian aunty here when she was at Edinburgh uni, 30 years ago. So she often takes me and I can appreciate it is a great place for vegetarians with a huge selection of dishes. The service is top notch also.   However. Why mess with Flapjacks? After the initial shock of my meatless lunch, my Granny filled my hand with change and sent me to buy a cake from the counter. I licked my lips and chose a nice thick Flapjack. I hurried back to my seat and took one bite and was confused. Where was the syrupy, chewy goodness I was expecting? It had been replaced by some rather tasteless sawdust. Clearly in Vegan/Vegetarian world nice sweet cakes are a no no. This gives me a case of the sads.",

It sits above the restaurant and offers counter service with a full range of drinks and lots of options for salads and small bites. They also had 3 soups to select from, all sounded good, but I opted for the pea and mint. The soup was delicious and tasted very fresh, as did the two salads I got with it. In total it was 6.50 for the soup and salads with some nice fresh bread. The salads were a broccoli and olive with tomato and then a beetroot and carrot, both were tasty and fresh. I couldn't finish it all with the amount I was given. There isn't a lot of seating, but it was a nice spot to have a bite. They also have breads and rolls to take away and a range of health food products should you fancy buying something at random when getting some lunch.",

It has a food presentation system of a school cafeteria with you being served by folks that seem to have taken on a vow of servitude after having fallen in love with the place.    The food is pretty good and tasty. You may even make your carnivore compatriots say complimentary things about their meal.  The venue is bright with lots of room, even in the back.  The price is average and pretty on par with the Central Edinburgh Food tariff.   I would visit it more often, if I was closer.",

I got the Moroccan stew with eggplant, apricots, tofu and couscous and it was absolutely incredible.  It was served with a olive/pineapple/onion/rocket salad that was a perfect compliment to the meal.  I didn't even miss or notice the lack of meat in the dish.    The meal wasn't even that expensive (27 for 2 large organic beers, 2 dinners, and 2 desserts).  Oh I almost forgot! the dessert was also amazing.  We both got their fruit trifle with fresh whipped creme (seems to be a staple there), and couldn't have been happier.  The trifle was served with blueberries and redcurrant berries on top, and was delicious all the way down to the bottom layer of fruit.  It's a must have.  The atmosphere of the restaurant was what truly set this place apart for me.  They have a live band every night from around 7-9 playing guitar or piano.  The music was very good (you never really know when its a small gig like that) and incredibly relaxing.  They had a weekly schedule on the wall (and it seems its mostly Jazz, but I only saw one week's schedule).   If I lived in Edinburgh I would go there 3 nights a week at least to grab a beer and a snack and listen to some live music after work.",

Despite being a carnivore, I'm always happy with the food here - it's super fresh and delicious and you don't feel guilty after eating it! The downstairs restaurant offers canteen style ordering - and you can get a good idea of what's available by checking out what's on display.   There's normally some type of art on the wall here too - it makes for an interesting place to stop for lunch or breakfast and unwind. There's no pretence; OAPs catching up over pots of tea mix with students and yummy mummies and I've seen a few business meetings being held here too. Just a lovely place to spend some time. The deli upstairs is great for snacks on the go and by all accounts the sit down bistro is a treat to visit.",

I now live on the other side of town, but managed to make it along with a friend one weekend lunchtime. It was rather busy, so we joined the queue and eyed up the cabinet delights, as didn't want a huge meal or to linger too long. I wanted one of the tasty looking salads, but didn't think that would fill me up, so got a pizza bread slice to go with it and my friend got soup with oatcakes, as she had never tried them before, and a large slice of carrot cake to finish.  My pizza bread was lukewarm, but couldn't be bothered waiting to get it heated some more, so just went with it. The salad was rather tasty though - greens, roasted pumpkin, feta and seeds. My friend said the soup was nice, but nothing amazing and the oatcakes were rather on the dry side. I'm not sure if these were homemade oatcakes, but they looked a little different to normal.  I tried some of her carrot cake as well and it was nice and moist with extremely sweet cream cheese icing.  We were seated in an area around the corner, which was an unusual space, with low ceilings, but kind of cosy. Overall I was a little disappointed and wouldn't rush back, although am willing to give Henderson's another chance.",

Descending down the steps into the main part of the restaurant, it was obvious that this was a very popular bustling  Edinburgh eatery. Our table at the back end of the restaurant was cosy for the five of us and near to a wall housing humorous artwork. After perusing the interesting selection on the menu for quite a time, enough for me to change my mind on numerous occasions, we still hadn't had our order for drinks taken. As I beckoned one of the waiters over, he looked quite perturbed that I disturbed his routine, but quickly changed his demeanour to take our order.   A couple of us ordered the Yellowhammer, a very quaffable golden ale that complimented the mains perfectly, whilst others plumped for the Innis and Gunn, the beer combined with whisky. Going straight for the mains, I could have gone for the Vegan Haggis that everybody raves about, but instead went for the Stack including roasted courgettes, peppers and my new favourite food - halloumi, on a bed of salad, lovely and light. We had a quite a variety of other dishes including a hearty risotto, a chunky vegetable soup with big slices of filling bread, and a spicy chickpea and cauliflower curry, with chilli, coriander, and basmati rice. None of the dishes were overtly big in portion size, but more than made up for in flavour.  Desserts were almost obligatory, the Belgian dark chocolate and coffee pot, was delightful, fantastic complimenting flavours. The mango and passion fruit creme brulee as refreshing as it sounds, and the cherry pie, a triumphant nod to the classic dish served in an American diner. An enjoyable evening for the company and the great food, but the restaurant was slightly too busy for me personally on the night we visited",

    "text": "Hmmmm, trying to be a vegetarian for the month and, on a trip to Edinburgh was looking for somewhere for lunch. The deli is well rated so I thought I'd give it a go.   The food looked amazing!!!! If I ate with my eyes then I would have been an amazing experience ... But let's get down to reality ... There is a limited choice of hot lunches on the menu board and at the time of my visit, parking the soup (pointless waste of food), I was left with different types of burger. So in the interests of comparing like with like, I went for the bean burger as I have more chance of getting those elsewhere than I do something more fancy.   It was reasonably priced and there was a good choice of add on items to make it a lunch.   But where would I sit ... The place is small. I had ready had to shuffle past a damp old lady more closely than I otherwise would like to have, just to get to the till. There is limited seating but fortunately an empty stool next to the window sill beckoned and I shuffled up next to a damp middle age man, taking up his news paper page turning arm space and close enough to the window to lick the condensation.   The food arrived quickly ... Perhaps too quickly in hindsight ... But it looked lovely.  Here I stumble upon the main issue. A bean burger is pretty much just that, just mushed up beans ... Hendersons had done well to try and disguise the impending disappointment with spicy red sauce on the side, some salad and a bun that had seeds to make it look like the acne on a teenagers cheeks. But it still tasted like mushed up kidney beans ... Aka DULL!!!  The many assorted filo parcels were winking and laughing at me from behind the glass chiller. \"Should have picked me\" they laughed. But they weren't in the eat in menu and I didn't want to sit in the rain eating cold vegetarian food from a paper bag ....  Great reputation, Good location, Reasonable price, small, busy and disappointingly bean burgerish. But from other peoples comments I think I picked a duff choice on a wet day when maybe secretly, I was not enjoying playing at being a vegetarian ...",

The Man thought we should each get our own but I thought sharing would be perfect as we were just there for a hearty snack to keep us going. The wrap was FILLED with tasty bean pate (ie, smooth beans) and roast veggies. It HIT THE SPOT.  He even agreed that half a wrap was the perfect amount of food.   It was absolutely the best thing we could have chosen and we both felt our rumbling tummies soothe and thank us for the deliciousness.

I went into the deli (street level) and the helpful lady behind the counter told me they stopped serving lunch and I should try the downstairs restaurant or the vegan one. I went downstairs and again met a couple of helpful folks behind the counter. They explained the pricing on the salad and patiently waited while I made up my mind. Overall a very good and quick visit - I was a bit apprehensive after reading the other reviews complain about the service but my experience was nothing of the sort. Thanks Henderson's!",

I wanted to get the freshest, tastiest looking wrap possible to start my studying day off right!   On the shelf there werent too many options, but among them there were a couple that looked quite stale and one being out-of-date. I handed it back to the lady at the till, then proceeded to choose. I went for the spicy bean wrap.   I was crossing my fingers that I'd be able to handle the amount of spice (yaneverknowright?), and opted for this. I remember it being around the region of 2.95. Took it away, and hopped on the bus. When I finally had my first opportunity to take a nice bite I found out the wrap. was. spiceless.   Now when I say spiceless I mean 1. no spicyness 2. no flavour. I paid 3 pounds for essentially a wrap with black beans in it. No salsa, not much else... oh and they said there was cheese in it. WHAT CHEESE??! SO disappointed.   Now I don't know whether Henderson's is one of those places that poorly represents vegan/vegetarian food to be bland and tasteless... but I was disappointed. It was a very poor wrap.    I like vegetarian food! Henderson's you gotta represent better! You're gonna give vege food a bad rep, man!",

While some have stated that its lacking in atmosphere, i actually really enjoy the hubbub of conversation. the mix of people and the unpretentious atmosphere. Very much one for the locals as well.  Unlike many restaurants, coming here is a great guilt free way to indulge as it all tastes so fresh and you can actually feel the nourishing properties, particularly in the hearty soups and salads.  A particular mention for the puddings though, the chocolate mousse is to die for.   Henderson's, don't ever change and never stop.",

We ended our meal with a slice of chocolate nut cake and chocolate banana cake. All the food was fab! The only thing that was not up to par was the service.

I suspect, but do not know for sure, that the three co-located 'brands' share a kitchen and differ only in the ambiance...quick serve/take out with few seats, lunch/cafeteria style, and sit down dining.  Salad Table is the lunch/cafeteria style location.  The food was good, always nice to eat at a restaurant where the entire menu is available for us to eat.  Everything was good.  I felt the need to order the 'haggis' which (in my opinion) a clever marketing ploy to draw in vegetarian tourists.  It was an enjoyable dish, but basically lentils and mashed potatoes.  Keep that in mind when ordering.  Again, this is a solid vegetarian restaurant, I would certainly return if we are fortunate enough to return to Edinburgh in the future.",

They sprinkle sone greens onto the plate for a little salad as well which is a nice touch to some of the heartier items.   The choices were nice and diverse. I felt like a little spice and they had some Indian/Middle Eastern themed options. I also had some vegan haggis in a parcel which was fantastic!   The people were very nice and helpful.

It was a mushroom with dill and garlic soup and we couldn't taste any of the listed ingredients in it. It was just thin puree of something not recognizable. Salads were so-so too, they had a dull taste. Nothing special, just grated/chopped raw veggies. Why not serve sauces with them? We also ordered a piece of carrot cake which was a bit on a tough side and tea was totally tasteless. No taste at all. It's not that it was weak. It did not have any taste. All n all our bill was 26.30. Unfairly overpriced mediocre food. What's wrong with cooking for vegetarians? Why so often it doesn't have any taste... and plain boring",

It's purely vegetarian, but don't let that put you off; even if you're not vegetarian I think you'll love it. The food is second to none. It's a Scottish institution and is world renowned. A deli/bakery and canteen style restaurant during the day, Henderson's on Hanover Street converts to a table service restaurant after 5pm. They also have a Bistro on Thistle Street. I visited the Hanover Street restaurant on Wednesday evening. We pre-booked a table and I'm glad we did as it was very busy. The main restaurant area was booked out for a private party, however we managed to get a table in the more relaxed canteen style area. It definitely has a super relaxed cafe vibe and could benefit from dimmed lighting and/or candles in the evening. Some music would be good as well to enhance the atmosphere. We didn't mind though - our visit was purely to sample the world famous food. My two dining companions started with red pepper hummus, flatbreads & pickled veg. I opted for vegetarian haggis with oat cakes & whisky cream sauce. My companions both went for mains of thai nut burgers, with salad, potato wedges & lime coconut cream. I choose the polenta tower main (polenta cake, portobello mushrooms, goats cheese, olive tapenade, roast cherry tomatoes, salsa, green peppers and rocket leaves). Desserts consisted of cherry pie with soya ice cream and a creme brulee. There's a great wine and beer list with lots of organic options. I've eaten in michelin star restaurants which haven't served food as good as Henderson's does. The food here is delectable. Don't expect it to be cheap though just because it's vegetarian (I noticed some other reviews complained about the cost). Prices are what you would pay in any restaurant, however you will get supreme, fine, delicious, top quality food here. The greatest grub ever! I wish there was a Henderson's in Belfast...",

    "text": "Here's the deal: Henderson's, I really want to love you. - Soup today was damn well delicious. But the service falls short.    I can't have yeast at the moment, amongst a few other things including dairy, sugar and white flours. I wanted a quick takeaway lunch so figured Henderson's would be a safe bet considering they're a vegan establishment. - So dairy, at least, would be off the menu.  I pop in and say that I'll need a little help with ordering. I notice pastries which look lovely but I really wanted to be careful, especially considering that I could see cheese and vegan cheese often contains yeast to add flavour. I'm sure most vegans would know this.  I know that yeast is an uncommon intolerance as opposed to dairy or wheat, but I really think the staff could have been far more helpful. The lady behind the counter swiftly passed me over to another lady. This second lady spoke English well but wasn't a native speaker and didn't know what yeast was.   There was no mention of getting someone from the kitchen or having a look at an ingredients list. There was no apology either. Surely staff should know or be able to access ingredients. Instead I felt disappointed and made to feel a little bit silly. I just longed for a pastry that I could possibly eat but, alas, I went for soup and wanted out of there fast.  What I really should have done is walked out and headed somewhere else, but it was well past lunchtime and my stomach was a-grumbling furiously.  For the prices Henderson's charges, I would expect far better service. At the moment, I am not inclined to go back.",

    "text": "Always nice to find an all vegetarian restaurant in northern Europe! So many options! My partner and I both got the risotto and side salads. I thought the risotto was so so but my partner really loved it. It was quite moist and creamy. Side salads nothing special, but they have a lot to choose from which is nice.  The star of the show was the fruite almond torte thing with fresh whipped creme that I had for dessert. Oh. My. God. So amazing.  I would probably give it a 3 1/2 star if I could. The atmosphere is quite cute.",

    "text": "I had baked potato with satay curry - quite a filling meal given the large spud, plus ground cashews and tofu chunks along with the veg in the satay sauce. Pudding was homemade bakewell tart with cream. Everything was really wholesome and hearty. I love the cosy, welcoming atmosphere. Food is served canteen-style during the day, with table service in the evening. The was a bit of a queue, but staff worked efficiently to work through it, and I was sat down eating in no time. As it was during the festival season, an unexpected bonus was the pianist playing a variety of pop, jazz and classical music on the upright piano. Given the level of tourism and foodism in the city, I would be interested to explore alternative wholefood and vegetarian venues in Edinburgh. But in the meantime, Hendersons is a well-established safe bet with a variety of dining options. There are three outlets on Hanover Street - a restaurant, a cafe/deli and a dedicated Hendersons Vegan restaurant; and also an a la carte type venue on the Mound, near the Bank museum. Long may the Hendersons of Edinburgh tradition continue!",

    "text": "The Thai nut burger with a coconut curry cream sauce, some greens and radicchio with vinaigrette and diced cherry tomatoes, all for 8.25 quid, rocked my world. While the spice brought tears to my eyes (I am hypersensitive on spice), I enjoyed the rich flavors involved. I was overall impressed with the variety of veg food available, from soups to stews to salads to lentils and breads (and desserts!)  The man playing piano in the back room added a nice touch.",

    "text": "Weird. That was my main take away. The food was ok -- nothing amazing, a little pricey, but serviceable. We ate in the downstairs portion with table service, which inexplicably featured a very loud piano player. He wasn't bad, really, but way too loud for such a small space and playing a bizarre song selection (teenage dirt bag?). I was really relieved when he went on break, and we skipped dessert to avoid subjecting ourselves to further entertainment.  There aren't a ton of vegetarian options in Edinburgh, so that alone is enough to recommend this place. However, I would recommend skipping the table service!",
