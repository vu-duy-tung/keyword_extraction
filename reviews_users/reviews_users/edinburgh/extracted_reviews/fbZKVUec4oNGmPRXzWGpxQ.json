    "text": "Everyone needs their local Italian restaurant - the slightly shabby, rustic, yet authentic place you always go whenever you want to eat out and can't be bothered with venturing anywhere new. When I moved to Edinburgh 4 years ago I thought I'd found that in Bar Napoli... I was hugely mistaken.  In a cheap and cheerful Italian, you'd expect the staff to be friendly and bubbly - not grumpy and rude. You'd expect the red and white checked table cloths, but not dirty ones still with smatterings of the previous customer at your table's food. Likewise, the basket of bread they give you to nibble whilst you wait ages for your food was so stale you could have smashed a window with it.  Yes, it's cheap. But even though a pizza in the evening only costs a fiver, it's a fiver I'd genuinely rather spend on a McDonald's. This is the only place I've given a 1 Star rating so far on Yelp!  It's open until the small hours and for that reason I think so many people go, the 2am munchies will drive you to eat almost anything... and if what I read in a local newspaper recently is to be believed, that's precisely what you risk doing when you eat here.",

We went for lunch and took advantage of a deal they had on which was 3 courses for 4.95, an absolute bargain in my opinion!   For the starter I had breaded mushrooms which were delicious. The other 2 had soup which was also good.   For the main myself and one other chose pizza, which I thought was good and I got to watch the chef prepare it from my seat which was fun!   As part of the lunch deal the dessert was chosen for you already and on this day it was apple crumble which is a favourite of mine. All three of my party enjoyed this and we almost licked the plates!   After finishing and asking for the bill we were already discussing a return visit to Bar Napoli.   I think the decor and the atmosphere would suit people of all ages and tastes. The one thing to be aware of however is that they share a toilet with the Restaurant next door so be sure to exit from the door you came in!   Overall a lovely eatery and a great place for a lunch, especially if you have limited time as the service is extremely fast and we had all 3 courses in under an hour.",

I was ready to leave but knowing everything is closed already, we might as well stay and try other meal. So I tried their lasagna and pizza. Lasagna was ehhh...  if you like your lasagna drowning in sauce and cheese then this is for you. Pasta disintegrated in between sauce and cheese. Overall, not impressed.",

My man also enjoys it and in his mind, it's the epitome of Italian food so I had to stop in.  Now me.. I've been to Italy and I *love* Italian food and have it often. I'm a bit pickier. Do I think this place is worthy of such high regard? Not really. But it's somewhere I'd stop in occasionally if I were a local and needed a late-night bite. Nothing tasted especially drool-worthy to me and I could not find any of my go-to meals on the menu which disappointed me. I had to modify my order to get something remotely tasty which is always a bad sign. It was still acceptable and tasted good but it was nothing to write home about. My man was in heaven with the same old thing he orders every single time he's come here for years and years... but that really does not give a large perspective of what their kitchen can pump out.  Aside from that, I was a bit annoyed with some loud partiers nearby and some drunken suits who kept bumbling to and from the bar to place their orders for to-go pizzas or whatever the hell it was they wanted that required practically screaming all over the place and ruining whatever ambiance was going on for the people who were dining in.

I had a rigatoni carbonara-style and my friend's order was the wrong thing but she ate it anyway and it was good. we had a $18 bottle of table wine that was ok.  so...forget the apps and dessert. have the pasta and wine. don't set your expectations too high. two stars seem low and three seem too high. it was decent for what it was, but unless it's cold and rainy and you don't want to go too far from your hotel, you can probably find a better place",

We had a super tasty pizza, very well cooked, crispy (perhaps too thin)  but complimented with many rich toppings. We did not left anything on the plate. The waiters were very busy this time so they did not spent much time questioning. We wanted some changes in the toppings, and were served as per request (it's not rare that waiters get changes in toppings wrong!)  There were many people and the tables were a bit too close to each other (a certain feel of lack of privacy) but I did not went to a romantic dinner!  The amount of noise was high as it seems there was a noisy group below and our table was close to the stairs, but that is called bad luck not bad service. Despite with many people, we got our pizzas in reasonable time, though the drinks came a bit late (and that do not require much time to serve).  The prices are reasonable good (ranging 7-8) and I have seen many pizzas in Edinburgh 8-10GBP, but in Malta 3-5 (5-7Eur)!   I have not surveyed many Pizzerias in Edinburgh, and I am pretty sure that one could find same taste and perhaps cheaper - but this Bar Napoli is a good option, and not far from Princes street.    4 stars well deserved for this time.",

The quality isn't great; however the waiters are funny and cheerful, it's easy to get a table and the prices are low. The 3 course lunch for 4.45 (how on earth do they manage it?) and its proximity to Princes Street ensure that there are always people eating in here. I'm generally suspicious of restaurants that have huge menus and Bar Napoli has a HUGE menu, so it's probably a good idea to stick to ordering popular things like margherita pizza and spaghetti carbonara: my rationale being that if lots of people are ordering it, then it's bound to be fresh.  I'd advise you to avoid the antipasti platter and not to bother with the stale bread, probably a good idea to go somewhere else for dessert too.",

BUT if you're in the city centre and looking for a bit of little Italy, with welcoming Italian hospitality, a bustling open kitchen and a mountain of dishes to choose from - then this is your place.  The menu is so vast that it can be an experience in itself just choosing what you want - particularly recommended is the mussels with thick crusty bread, or something completely indulgent like the carbonara. And the service is warm and considerate. The food is simple, with some dishes being better than others, but I love going for the overall atmosphere and for some good old fashioned Italian comfort food.   One of the great features of this spot is that it is open until the wee small hours, and keeps serving until late even on a week day.",

You just realise that you've been drinking for 12 hours and need to eat something which isn't a kebab or a deep fried haggis.  I don't have much to say about the food, sometimes it tastes a bit soapy but it's just your run of the mill Italian restaurant with very cheap house wine.",

    "text": "It's pouring with rain. It's 11pm. It's Sunday. We just wanted somewhere for a quick late night supper.  The first place we came across that was still open was Bar Napoli. Judging from the exterior and the decor inside, we assumed we wouldn't be treated to anything near haute cuisine - this place has a feel about it that suggests you're going to get average-to-ok food. And the menu is super-scarily-ridiculously long. They can't possibly prepare all those meals!  With this in mind, we opted two very simple dishes - ones that ought to be very hard to get wrong. And it was perfectly fine. Sure, the pizza was a bit bready, and perhaps our pesto pasta was just a touch on the oily side, but it really was a better option than the late night 'eateries' around the corner offering kebabs.   Surprisingly pleasant. Wouldn't think of coming here for an actual dinner though, but for a very late night supper, it's about right.",

    "text": "The restaurant was busy and the atmosphere good. The kitchen is open so you can see the food being prepared. We hadn't booked but managed to get a table for two. Soon after we arrived, there were a number of people turned away because all of the tables were full  in my experience a good sign. Most of the staff were friendly and polite but one male (owner or family?) was rather misserable and a little abrupt. This was more than made up for by the quality of the pizza we recived which was first class and exactly as we had requested. All in all a really good meal in a resturant with a good atmosphere and for a very reasonable price.",

    "text": "Seems like Jenny L beat me to the punch here but being as we ate at Bar Napoli at the same time, it's not really a massive surprise to see that we've both awarded it the same number of stars.  It's been a long time since I've felt like I was genuinely putting somebody out, longer still since that person was a waiter. The waiter in this case literally threw our cutlery at us and wouldn't give me any pepper! I'm not a believer that service when dining out needs to be all posh and la di dah, but I want to at least be treated like I'm welcome in the establishment.  The food was very meh - my Carbonara was over egged (over egging the pasta is now certainly going to be a stock phrase of mine) and relatively tasteless; a shame for my favourite pasta dish to be so carelessly treated. The girls' pizza looked good although it was served in the most confusing manner possible (toppings divided into quarters with them both getting two each?!) and I get the impression that the on site dough is probably one of the best things about this place.  The price however was reasonable with four of us eating for around 20, and if you're drunkenly stumbling by you'd be better spending a few quid on a pizza here than at a greasy kebab shop.  I'd be prepared to go back again and get the feeling that certain dishes there are probably spectacular. It's definitely the case that better service would almost certainly add another star to the above rating, on this occasion though we couldn't get out quick enough!",

They were closed for being 'horrifically unhygienic' , having the 'lowest standards ever seen by an inspector' and  people were surprised 'nobody had died from eating here' . If that's a reason not go to, I don't know what is.  However, if it's 2am and you're desperate for food, Bar Napoli is your place....as soon as it re-opens",
