    "text": "I wandered in here and did a double take - was I in the right place? Is this still in Edinburgh and if so why doesn't the rest of Edinburgh look like this? (Why doesn't my kitchen look like this) - Yes I am impressed with the interior from the mezzanine to the indoor market feel of the chartecurie Island 'bar' in the middle. Once seated we were promptly helped by a waiter-in-training. He was nervous but incredibly friendly and helpful. (possibly the watchful eyes of his mentor played part in this but it felt very genuine).   I was here with Anita A. (she reviewed this earlier) My experience was slightly different than hers. I too noticed the big shapy chandeliers and I think they fit. As mentioned the service is high standard, as we had a trainee waiter we'll overlook some of the mistakes that he made.   My Rabbit Taglioni was delicious, well cooked and well seasoned.  Anita's slow cooked lamb ravioli (a special) was al dente, however the pasta (all daily home made and fresh btw) was a big thick on the edges thus in our opinion deserved some longer cooking time. This was mentioned and promptly the dish was returned to the kitchen and chef made a new dish with 12 min cooked ravioli instead of 8. When delivered back to the table, they ensured that every care was taken to make this dish perfect... but he forgot to supply Anita with some fresh cutlery as they took the former set away to the kitchen, thus she had to nick from the table behind her.  These extra 4 minutes made not much difference to the thickness of the ravioli edges, nor was it notably softer. Anita left these on her plate. The sauce and filling were delicious though.   The limoncello jello dessert was meh. It didn't feel there was much effort was put in to this. The FroYo was good though.  In all this place is very good, but somehow it needs a bit more work.  I expected more from this. Shame because I do not want a place like this to get a bad reputation and it has a lot of initial WOW factors but when it come to the delivery there are niggles. I don't like niggly bits, they annoy me and create bad aftertaste, both in the food and in the overall feeling.   Anita and I will try it again for a dinner.",

    "text": "Managed to grab a table for dinner on Sunday night at the start of June without a reservation. I was pretty chuffed as I'd been meaning to try it for a while & loads of friends have been raving about the service & the food.  The location is fab - in the newly refurb'd Assembly Rooms on George St. The decor is amazing. The charcuterie bar in the centre is a nice touch and I really like the open view of the kitchen. I spied a chef's table which looks like it is almost in the kitchen. Such fun!  The service was really good. Our waiter explained the set-up & made some good recommendations. He was attentive without bring in our face.  We had the sharing platter between the two of us & it was plenty big enough. The charcuterie selection was great and we were pretty full by the time we gad mar our way through the meats & cheeses. I loved the arancini balls. Full of flavour & melt in the mouth texture. We played roulette with the chilli peppers. Luckily for me they weren't too kickin' & i didn't end up with mascara running down my face.  There were plenty taster portions of the mains too. OH didn't like the risotto. He thought it too bland but I enjoyed it & would definitely have it as a main. The spaghetti was average but it's not my fav Italian dish so it didn't let the side down for me. The chicken dish was lovely & I enjoyed my first taste of polenta chips. Though a bot more seasoning wouldn't have gone amiss.  The platter was so big, that I had to share my brownie & ice cream with the OH as I was too full to manage a portion to myself. A delicious moist brownie & a decent sized portion. I'm be back for more.",

Finally got my clam linguine, yet... it was disappointing. None of that deep clam flavor you want in a good vongole dish. Instead a WAY too salty, soupy garlic mess. Clams were good, but the overuse of garlic just overpowered the entire dish. This is not my grandma's clam white sauce. Boy wanted italian sausage, but they were out. Backup choice was turkey. Came out in two large, breaded cutlets that just looked bland, dry and boring. Boy's verdict? They were bland, dry and boring.   Jamie, you are really letting us down here, buddy. The boy loves you. You have standards to maintain. We decided we arent coming back for quite a while to give this place time to sort some stuff out. Sadly, it seems they are resting on the laurels of Jamie's name at the sacrifice of food quality.",

    "text": "Touring with picky eaters can be frustrating, so when I saw Jamie's Italian I felt it was a safe bet since my picky eaters like pasta.   The waitstaff was busy but very attentive, friendly, and easy to talk to.   The decor is has a bright modern appeal, high ceilings give a nice feel of open space. Lots of attention to details such as decorative tiles.  The food was great. Tip if your picky 8 year old has barely eaten anything all day, one kid's spaghetti bolognese may not cover it, we had to order a second. They brought out a little decorated \"Shake Salad\" in a sealed container with the kids meal. Nice little touch, I'm sure meant to make a healthy addition fun for the kids.  I had a delicious pepper burger, with seasoned fries, and micro brew bottled beer.   The only reasons I don't give this place a higher score is that it felt very trendy, like going to Hard Rock Cafe, or some other large chain, and their lack of a draft beer selection. I was hoping for something a little more out of the ordinary from the Jamie Oliver I've seen on t.v.",

After calling about getting a booking, they told us they were full that night but if we wanted to come by late around 9 PM, possible they could find us something. We did just that and the very nice host who met us immediately said she will get us a quiet table. The service here was outstanding and we thought the place had a really cool kind of vibe to it with an interesting and very reasonable priced menu. We started with cheesy rissoto balls in marinara which were great and a plank of cured Italian meats, cheese and these super good olives. For dinner we had a seafood mussel rissoto with bacon and a tagliatelle bolognese which looked like octopus tentacles but tasted absolutely perfect. Overall our best dinner in Edinburgh.",

We were there with our 2 children for a Saturday lunch so it was very busy but I don't think that is enough of an excuse for the lack of distinction in the food and the rather lacklustre service. The kids meals were particularly uninspiring. My daughter had the fish fingers but there was nothing to go with the fish (which was a very small portion) other than a tiny salad (which didn't really fit with the dish). If you want a family friendly Italian experience in Edinburgh there are much better choices (for example La Favorita or any of that chain).",

I'm not sure who his property scout is or how he manages to set up restaurants inside these amazing buildings but KUDOS J.O.. Kudos!  The food was average, nothing I got overly excited about.  There seemed to be wayyy too many staff all standing around doing fairly little though when we actually wanted someone to come to our table, it seemed difficult to get anyone's attention. *frustration*  I would head back in and grab a drink just to admire the decor.. but I'm not in any hurry to have another meal here.",

Other dishes at our table such as linguini and prawns got a fairly good review, and some of the other pasta dishes looked pretty good. Overall, for what appears to be a high quality food restaurant walking in didn't really deliver. If you find other better options for Italian, you may want to skip this restaurant. But at the same time, this wasn't that bad either...thus the 3-stars.   Also, it is fairly loud and busy inside, so I don't recommend if you're tired and wanting a nice relaxing meal. And the temperature inside seemed overly warm for an early June day, with nearly every table full. We felt like we were a little too toasty while trying to enjoy a meal.   If we were back in Edinburg again anytime soon, I think we'd skip coming back here.",

Fairly good antipasti despite the crostini being slightly stale. Nice pork belly. Tip top roast potatoes. Too rich chocolate tart. The room was interesting and enjoyable.  But with average food there has to be something really special to make you come back. It lacked wow or pizazz. The staff were competent and pleasant. But in competition with family run places like Nonna's in Morningside they're sure to come second.",

My husband had the truffle pasta which I tried and it was excellent. The Bolognese pasta was just ok to me, but my husband thought it was great. The desert, brownie with ice cream was fantastic. The server was friendly and very attentive. I really enjoyed my time there I just which I had gotten the steak (which is also on the price fix menu).",

Unfortunately this is not one of them. Yes the decor is very grand and the Assembly Rooms is a stunning building but I'm let down with the food every time I go (yes I go back for the gold card loyalty extras - shallow yes? free bottle of cava - hell yes!). It's not terrible but I'm always left thinking, I could of kinda done this better at home. (See Jamie, you've made a rod for your own back.) Last time was a few weeks ago when my friend's pasta was stodgy and overcooked and my fish stew was just kinda meh. And please if you do go don't even think about the mint tea - more like mouldy old sock. So 3 stars for starters, good but antipasto and bread so you'd be hard pushed to go wrong there, free birthday cava (loyalty card) and the service was fair.",

Next we each had a pasta dish - four different pasta dishes - all were delicious, especially the SAUSAGE PAPPERDELLE, as was the truffle risotto.  We finished up with some tasty deserts - our only dissapointment was that they had run out of panacotta. All five of us were quite happy with our meals.  They have quite a nice, if small, wine list., with a very nice house red - sangiovese.  Service was supurb, even though the dining room was at maximum capacity.

I ordered the turkey Milanese which was good but spoiled by an unecessary light sprinkiling of rock salt for garnish or something. My mother ordered the 'special' risotto primavera which was bland but acidic (lemon does not need to go on everything Jamie) and the rice was overcookedso she changed it for a vegetable lasagne by the time it arrived the rest of the table had finnished and it was stone cold in the middle.The staff were good and the manager did not charge for the lasagne or the risotto and we got a percentage off the total but for a place and a price like this you expect much better.They have a fantastic venue excellent space, amazing decoration but like so many places in Britian the get so caught up in the decor and the shape of the plates they forget about the the quality of the FOOD that goes on these lovely expensive looking plates. Put the food first and the service needs to be quicker but less intense and forced.Has a platform and potential to be a great place but needs sharpen up in the kitchen.

I tried to book, but was told that they only have so many tables to book each evening and these were gone, so only option was to go in and wait for a table.  We arrived at 730pm Friday 28th sept 2012, told it was a 1hour 45min wait.  We decided to wait, the atmosphere was brilliant, the interior beautiful, I loved the loos, brilliant loo handle, so much so, I had to take a photo ( I must be rather sad, over come with excitement for getting out for the evening).  I think I made my way through half the cocktail list at the bar in the wait for our table, we also ordered 2 appetisers, during our wait at the bar.  The cheesy nachos dish was beautiful and then we ordered bread and oils, this wasn't so good, the bread was dry and required more oil, would have been nice to have a separate dish of oil for dipping.  The bread comes in a fancy small dish, 3 of our breads fell out on the floor, the waitress picked them up and walked away, and to be honest we were that starving from our wait I would have ate them off the floor.  I do think that we should have been given more bread, as the dish the bread is delivered in is not suitable for when waiting in the bar area.  But that is me being very picky.  We did get our table bang on the full 1hr45min wait.  Food arrived promptly that we ordered, I had the pasta arribbatta dish, was very hot and spicy, just the way I love it, my partner had the lamb, he said it was good but he has had better lamb kebabs ( I think that meant it was ok, but not amazing).  I think I will need to go back very soon, this time not so drunk just to check out that it was that great.  Overall I had a brilliant time, met my expectations, I loved the food and the building.",

Small print: it can only be used in July, not August like Glasgow's Jamie's Italian.   The service was a bit disappointing: the waitress didn't know what is the fish of the day, neither what the blade steak was like (size, weight), nor that the starter comes with focaccia bread which the chef missed adding when the meat plank was brought in our table.   The starter - mix of meat and vegetarian choices - nothing was precooked apart from grilled vegetables: selection of salami and ham, cheese, olives and chillies.   The two of us got the feather blade steak which was surprisingly good, being used to the chunky Scottish steaks! The chips were signature polenta, I think they were like smashed potato with semolina, a pleasant change compared to the standard ones, sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.   Finally we had as dessert a hearty size of chocolate brownie with ice cream, while one friend had the Raspberry and chocolate rippled pavlova which was the highlight of the night!   Would I go back? I doubt it!  You fancy checking out what the Jamie Italian looks like? Go for it!",

    "text": "Being a Jamie Oliver fan back from his Naked Chef show days, I was excited to finally be able to eat at one of his restaurants. Sadly, this experience turned out to be one of the worst dining experiences of my life!   They give you a pager that you can't leave the restaurant with, which is understandable given that the pager range may be limited. However, when I asked if we could put our name down and come back in about an hour to pick up our pager (which a lot of restaurants do, especially Cheesecake Factory given their popularity), considering the wait time we were quoted was 1.5 to 2 hours, we were told no, that we had to wait in the small bar area that had no seating area and was already overcrowded.  While standing and waiting in the small bar area we decided we would seat ourselves at the bar in the middle of the restaurant. There were six open stools and we sat in four of the empty stools. Where we sat there was only a bar menu. We thought that we could at least order some appetizers at this bar, however, a waitress quickly chased us out of that area and said that we couldn't sit there because they were planning to seat people for dinner there. What a joke! The whole 2+ hours we were there, they never sat anyone there!   When we were finally seated after what felt like an eternity, we were seated in the back of the restaurant by the kitchen. Waiters butts were right there. It felt like it was over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. It was so hot and uncomfortable sitting in that area that I had to go outside to cool down. All you felt sitting in this section right by the open kitchen was just heat radiating at you from the ovens, it was as if I was sitting in an oven while trying to eat my meal. After moving our table, the food arrived.  Now I realize we weren't in Italy; however, you'd think eating at a restaurant that has a well-known chef as its owner who has cooking shows and criticizes what people eat in America, that you'd be able to get a decent meal. Not the case at Jamie Oliver's where the pasta was horrible and there was no complimentary bread. Jamie should take a page from Carrabba's (an Italian chain restaurant in America) for how to serve quality Italian food. You'd think Jamie Oliver could actually serve decent food at his namesake restaurant considering he's a chef and has a cooking show, where he appears to know what he's doing, but clearly not! Overall, just a miserable dining experience on so many different levels.",

    "text": "Knowing full well that this is a 'Name' restaurant only and that Jaime Oliver probably hardly shows up at this place, I still expected something better.  Instead I probably just had one of the worst Italian dining experience of my life.  First we had reservations for 7:15pm on a Wednesday night. We didn't get seated until 8:45pm.  Being part of the industry, Busy night/shorthanded, whatever, I let it slide.  After being seated, the server didn't come over to take drink or food orders until 15 min later. And did not tell us the specials which we overheard another server tell their table after we were finishing up.    We got pasta for 2 kids, the Meatball Pappardelle,  and steak frites with the meat board, calamari, and pork scratchings to start.  The charcuterie and the cheese on the board were delicious (and the only reason I gave them 2 instead of 1 star), calamari were tough and chewy, breading a tad soggy.  Pork scratchings were mediocre.  We also order a couple of glasses of wine and N/A drinks for the kids.  Wine came in extremely dirty glasses, we asked for cleaner glasses and received them with apologies but still I don't understand how the first glasses seemed ok to use.  The kids drink, berry blast and orange shandy, so tart none of us could drink it.    The steak was like leather, but at least the frites were good.  The meatball pappardelle, which the server asked me a total of 4 times if spicy is ok because the dish is spicy, was not spicy at all.  AND I didn't receive pappardelle pasta, I got more like a fusilli.  Kids pasta also was double my portion.    All in all terrible experience. Would not dine here again.",

    "text": "I was very disappointed. After walking around trying to find something other than pub like food, I was exited to find this. My peer and I walked in, and it took 10 minutes to get us seated. This included the time it took to be acknowledged. Waiters kept walking by, and it wasn't until we started to seat ourselves did we get acknowledged and taken to a table.   The waiter came around and asked if we wanted something to drink. We asked for water, to give us time to look at the wine menu.   Another 15 minutes goes by, and as we are about to walk out after not even getting water, he comes by. Thankfully he acknowledged the wait, as I was becoming impatient. Knowing that we weren't off to a good start, we ordered right then.   After another 15-20 minutes, another waiter showed up with food that wasn't ours. We had to convince him it wasn't ours. This is where it got interesting. The waiter took the plates back to the serving area, where another gentleman came up and started talking to him. I saw them look at an order slip, look back to us, and the other guy shook his head, grabbed the plates, and came back to try to give us the same food! When I clearly stated that the salad I was getting wasn't the chicken cacciatore I ordered, he finally believed me.   Another 15 minutes, and our food arrived.   It was bland. Cold. And disappointing. Save your money, and find another place. I'm sure you'll find friendlier staff and better food elsewhere.",

    "text": "I'm already a fan of other Jamie's Italian restaurants elsewhere, I've been to 3 different restaurants now (Glasgow on more than a few occasions) and I have to say every single time the service and staff are brilliant. On this particular occasion it happened to be my birthday (woo!) and being a Jamie's Gold Card holder (it's SUPER easy to join & free) I know that usually on your birthday they like to surprise you with a little free birthday present, it might be a dish or a drink...the last few times it has been a bottle of their own really delicious Prosecco. Wow. That's some treat! It costs 27.25 for a bottle so them giving you that for nowt is really, really brilliant.   I'd never been to this Jamie's so it was great to check it out and what a beautiful venue it is, in the former supper rooms at the Assembly Rooms on George Street. It's one stunning restaurant and dining here really does feel like a treat. As soon as we walked in we were welcomed warmly and they wished me a Happy Birthday (nice touch!) and showed us to our table. We were sat right near the kitchens & I had a brilliant view of the place. Our waiter then came over, took my Gold Card (to check if I had any freebies on it) & informed me of my free bottle of Prosecco and took any other drinks orders. I also had a Strawberry Rossini just coz it was my birthday :-) Very delicious it was too.  Having an intolerance to a lot of seafood/shellfish means half the menu isn't suitable for me sadly as it can be at times quite seafood heavy but I never struggle to find a good dish here. One thing I can eat is squid (Hurrah! says me, Boo! says the squid) so as we know it's really good here we both ordered the Crispy Squid ~ it never disappoints. So good. Although Pro-Tip: watch out for the big slices of chillies, you think they'd be mild but ooft. Nah. *gulps more Prosecco to put out the flames*   For main I went for the Penne Carbonara ~ not a dish I would usually order but you know here it's going to be good. It was; buttery, tasty, big cubes of smoked pancetta with a delicious sauce & the pasta was cooked perfectly. I had a side of the Rocket & Parmesan Salad which was also really nice. My boyfriend had the Jamie's Italian Burger with Funky Chips & he devoured it with gusto. We both sat, fully sated, bellies groaning when our cheery waiter appeared announcing that seens as it was my birthday (Aww, you guys!) I was entitled to a (free) birthday Brownie! Wah! So lovely :-) They REALLY know how to keep their customers happy here. I was so stuffed but also SO delighted & touched by their offer I could hardly say no...when it came to my table they had even written in toffee sauce a big 'HAPPY BIRTHDAY!' on the plate, again you guys!! *embarrassed face* Even though I was full I managed to eat the whole gorgeous thing, uh. It was so good. Thankfully not as heavy as some other brownies.   All in all I was totally blown away by the generosity of the staff here. I know it's a GC thang but even still, they went above & beyond to make my birthday meal with them really special.  Great service, great staff, great food, great drink, great venue ~ what more do you need? Love it. Thank's Jamie!",

    "text": "Visited this place at lunch time with Rayan D. I wasn't sure how popular this place is and whether we should book a table or not (since it's 'only' lunch time) and we decided to chance it. A table was indeed available when we arrived.  Upon entering the restaurant, I saw big chandeliers and red walls - for some reason I had expected a more modern look but at least it made an effect on me :) In the downstairs dining area there is a big italian bar 'island' with large parma hams hanging from above. Like Karen D. noted, probably not the best place to be seated if you are a vegetarian (I'm not though) and we had a table close by.  The waiter appeared very quickly and took our drinks order and explained the daily specials. I chose the slow cooked lamb ravioli with a sauce of sundried tomatoes and peas - it sounded wonderful. When my dish arrived, it looked and tasted lovely - the only issue was that the pasta was a bit undercooked. I guess the ravioli edges were thicker and thus needed more cooking time.  I explained this to the waiter who promised to rectify the situation. Meanwhile I tried Rayan's wild rabbit taglioni which was delicious, such lovely flavours!  After a while, a new dish was brought for me. I tried the ravioli. Still tasted great - but sadly still a bit undercooked. The centre of the ravioli was fine though, so I ate the food.   Rayan had a dessert of limoncello jelly and ice cream with fruit salad. I had a spoonful or 2 to try and it didn't blow my socks off. The fruit salad especially was not great, stringy sections of blood orange. Nice ice cream.  The service was absolutely spot on in this place, very attentive and friendly waiters so I was really pleased with that. They had kindly taken the dessert off the bill as I had an issue with the main course.  All in all I would like to try this place once more, perhaps for dinner next time.",

    "text": "Just ok but nothing special even with it being a birthday and pre theatre venue. Jamie's chicken served to me was mostly fatty so a wee bit meh as it felt like all I'd eaten was a big portion of salad that came with it. The macaroni tuna dish duly filled up my partner and the burger for another in our party thought it was a very generous portion.   Also great service from our waitress without being in your face, but as it was lunch bites we were having we were seated next to the kitchen. Now that's great if you like the heat in a working kitchen, but if you like it cooler then you might have to go sit outside for a bit of ventilation as there is no air con that I could feel.   Bottle of Proscueto on arrival as a birthday gift for being a gold member was really thoughtful, but a shame all the same that drinks, polenta chips and nice decor were the highlight of the visit. I would go back again Jamie but not unless things are different on your upstairs level towards George Street?",

Only two niggles, firstly the waitress never did bring the glass of water or bread basket that I asked for and secondly the pre-ordered lunch menu didn't list any information about veggie deserts, it took a phone call to the restaurant beforehand to establish that the pudding I had ordered of panetoni ice cream wasn't veggie.    That aside the meal was great.  I loved the anti pasti sharing platters to start, I loved the quality and care that chose the olives from a specific region and the tomatoes from the foothills of mount Vesuvius.   I would come back here again for sure, maybe after the Christmas rush for a more attentive waitress.    Nice touch to have a shop to purchase the goodies that the restaurant use.",

Atmosphere much nicer in upstairs dining room where we were seated. Tables were arranged around the cooking bar.   Two had pasta, one had salad and one  a chicken dish.  All delicious.  We have gone to a tapas place for just an appetizer which turned out to be more than expected. One of the niceties of the restaurant is that Jamie's offers dinners in two portion sizes which was perfect.   The smaller size was perfect for us.  Overall a good experience and I would recommend.",

I also love the magnificent drool-worthy pictures. Okay, okay, I confess; I have a severe foodie crush on Jamie and I compulsively pour through his recipes on a very regular basis.   Now, that's out in the open...How was my first visit to Jamie's Italian? The interior is stunning! But located in the oh-so-regal Assembly Rooms, you wouldn't expect anything less. With ruby red furnishings and elegant hanging chandeliers, the surroundings really are a delight; the restaurant definitely has that wow-factor. There's a cocktail bar. There's hanging meat. There's little Jamie personalised napkins. It's a little bit like a modernised Wes Anderson's Grand Budapest Hotel. Just a little. - I like it!   We were given a warm, friendly welcome and shown to a table as soon as we arrived. The menu is a mix of classic Italian dishes, with traditional pasta and salad dishes, along with some interesting sides and sharing platters. Having just attended the Fit Festival in the Assembly Rooms, it would have been sacrilege to have anything but a salad. So we went for the wholesome Market Superfood Salad which consisted of the following yummy, healthy ingredients:  Avocado, shaved fennel, candied beets, Italian sprouting broccoli, creamy cottage cheese, pomegranate, smashed nuts & seeds. Served with a fennel blossom Sicilian harissa, to this delicious combination you can also add grilled chicken or smoked salmon.   Now, there is a time and place for salad. Alas, this was not one one of them. Looking back, I wished I'd went for a good old bowl of carbonara or the signature Jamie's Italian burger. The salad was really very delicious, as was the bread and dip nibbles we'd ordered alongside. Although in hindsight, Jamie's is somewhere you should go all out and have a proper Italian feast.  Next time, Jamie, next time...",

We ordered various sides to share and I had the prawn linguine which was good but could have been more flavourful. The fresh pasta was really nice but the sauce and prawns could have had a bit more flavour. The zucchini frittes and posh chips were each delicious and unhealthy. The broccoli part of that featured side dish was very good except it was on a bed of over-salted spinach (the spinach wasn't mentioned in the menu and they could have done without it and with more broccoli!). Overall the meal was nice, although it didn't blow me away, and I signed up for the Gold Club so we got 10 off which was good. The decor is lovely and I really like the location under the Assembly Rooms, except can be a bit loud.",

The location in the Assembly Rooms is lovely, with gorgeous chandeliers and italian meats hanging from the bar area. The shared platters look fab and if I return it will be to sample this.",

    "text": "I came here with some friends I met in my tour group, and one of them is a fan of Jamie Oliver and made reservations for dinner the night before. She enjoyed her meal here and was telling me about it, and she suggested we come for dinner tonight. Now I'll be honest- I dont watch any cooking shows or YouTube videos or keep up with famous chefs and whatnot so I had no idea who he is. But my friend said the restaurant has good Italian food and I love Italian, so here I am.   I ordered from the Set Menu where you can choose 2 courses for 13 pounds plus dessert for an extra 3 pounds. Normally I dont get appetizers but my friend recommended the Ravioli Fritti, which is fried four cheese ravioli with sauce, so I ordered that as well as the vegetarian version of their Tagliatelle Bolognese pasta. Both dishes were good.  For dessert I ordered the Rich Chocolate Brownie, which comes with salted caramel gelato and caramel popcorn. My friend mentioned that James Oliver has good recipes for brownies so this is a popular item. I like it but the caramel popcorn with the brownie and ice cream was a little too weird for me. Like I like warm brownies with ice cream and I like caramel popcorn but the combination of all 3 didn't pair well in my opinion, especially since the popcorn wasn't crunchy (if the thought was to add a crunchy topping/texture). But I love salted caramel anything and you can't really go wrong with warm chewy brownies and ice cream, let alone salted caramel gelato, so overall I like it. It was also the perfect portion as it wasn't too big so I didn't feel that guilty afterwards.  The interior of the restaurant was beautiful.  The Total for all 3 courses was 16 pounds (from the special set menu- limited but good options).",

We asked our waiter if he recommended any cocktails. We each ordered a cocktail, a raspberry cocktail, an amerretto sour, a whiskey sour, and an old fashioned. None of us even took a second drink. Which is very rare. All of our drinks were off, and the ingredients were not balanced correctly.   For our appetizer we ordered the bruschetta, the fried ravioli, and fried squid. The fried ravioli tasted frozen, nothing spectacular at all.... the squid had maybe 8 pieces on the plate. It looked like somebody had already eaten half. Lastly, the bruschetta was nothing spectacular either. It was missing salt..   For our main entree we ordered spaghetti carbonara and rigatoni bagnolese. They were both awful. The pasta was undercooked and hard. The carbonara didn't even taste like carbonara.. it was extremely salty and not seasoned correctly at all. Their were long strips of bacon on top, when it's supposed to be pancetta. The bagnolese tasted like something out of a can.   This was one of the worst tasting food I've had in a while. I will never come back here.",

    "text": "I was on the hunt for a good restaurant in the New Town part of Edinburgh and stumbled across this place. I had a feeling that it would be good since it is Jamie Oliver's restaurant.  The menu has a lot of pasta and some salads on it in addition to some other mains. You can order all of the plates as a half portion, which is great if you aren't that hungry or can't finish a whole portion.  I ordered the burrata as an appetizer and a half portion of the superfood salad (with cottage cheese on top for some extra protein). The burrata was good, but perhaps a little underseasoned (it has only a little bit of pesto and tomatoes on the side. I really enjoyed the superfood salad, though the small dollop of cottage cheese barely seemed worth the extra 1.50. My friend ordered the pappardelle and meatballs, which she really enjoyed.  Overall, this was a solid restaurant to try with a good ambiance.",

Context was: we were a group of twenty people and had a set menu of 35 each where we could pick what we'd eat in a given set of starters, mains and dessert. With that we d get half a bottle of wine for each menu.  FIRST : the staff was indeed amazing and did a great job keeping up with all the plates coming and going.   1 we didn't get all the starters we ordered. Some of us are vegetarian and ordered so, and no veggies were to be seen in our starters.  2 they gave us three platters to share between 18, on some other tables they had almost the same size platter (maybe a little smaller) for just two people.  3 the shrimp linguine felt like they were warmed in the microwave and didn't have any taste.  4 some of us got the sides quite late compared to when the mains arrived. The manager offered us a bottle of wine to compensate  5 deserts were over sweet... But brownie was not bad  I'd still recommend the place if you're a couple or a little group of people but huge groups like ours seem to be too much to handle",

    "text": "I was the toxic third wheel of a newly married couple when I came to this restaurant, but that has little significance on my review except for the blurb below.   It was the groom's go to joint for a drink when he was in the area. This was the 1st time any of us had been in for a meal. Lunch time is definitely a better option with lunch specials. There was a 2 course starting at 12.95 or a 3 course starting at 14.95.  The ambience of this place is unique and pretty spectacular. It would have been a great date place if I wasn't tagging along with the newly married folks, but I picked up the tab of 50 pounds for 3 meals, 1 appetizer, one dessert and 2 non alcoholic beverages , so that third wheel toxicity should be worth it. Just saying...  The wait to get the food after ordering was far from incredible and when you are in Edinburgh and have to pay the astronomical parking costs, time matters. I think we waited about 45 minutes for 3 pasta dishes, so we had to ultimately get the dessert to go.  For having the pastas made from scratch, I would have to question the reality behind that. I have had better pasta noodles out of a box at home.  The calamari was pretty good and the flavors in the pasta (minus the slightly crunchy pasta) agreed with my palate. The epic brownie was also worth the calorie intake.   The atmosphere was great, the food was decent but the service could use some tweaking.",

Items were left off our meals and we were given excuses that it was because of Christmas, why not tell us this beforehand? And when asked for bread it came out after we had finished and when we said we would rather cancel, we were met with arguments from the staff. The manager victor had tons of excuses and attitude as to why things were left off and that we should have ordered bread sooner. He should maybe spend some more time managing and less time socializing with off duty staff at the table behind us.",

He rolled his eyes at a member of our group who asked for a certain type of drink. As the meal went on, he was continually snippy and irritated with us, even though we went out of our way to thank him at every course and help him with some of the cleanup. By the end, it was obvious he was annoyed. I completely understand that big groups are frustrating to serve. But his attitude was over the top and just unnecessary.   In terms of the food, I wasn't impressed. First course was calamari, but I was a vegetarian, so I ate nothing. Second course was chicken with pesto and fried polenta. Chicken was excellent - moist and flavorful. The fried polenta didn't have much flavor except for just the greasy fried flavor. Dessert was a brownie that was tasty, but nothing amazing or unique. No complimentary bread. I was underwhelmed by the food considering the Jamie Oliver brand and the pricey menu.",

Every time I tried to walk in and get a table, it was always booked until 10pm so I assumed this place must be good. After 2 failed attempts, I finally decided to reserve a table in advance so that I can experience Jamie Oliver's food before I leave UK. Located inside the elegant Assembly Rooms, the setting is classy and yet not stuffy. It's a pretty trendy place, and the price was affordable. In Scotland I didn't have much positive dining experiences but this was one of the few memorable ones. My only regret is that cannelloni was so filling that I didn't even have a room for dessert!!   I would definitely go back if I'm in Edinburgh!",

His truffle tagliatelle was delicious albeit, the pasta was VERY al dente. Like questionable, is this even finished cooking, al dente. We wrote it off as accidental, as it was edible, and the truffle sauce could've been on a shoe and I'd probably still eat it. My meat board was a better deal in terms of amount of food. The fresh mozzarella bocconcini was probably the best I've had.   The ox tail ragu was great, albeit again the pasta was very al dente. Not as much as the starter but still so. My mezzaluna ravioli was good but not amazing. It came with more mozzarella so that's probably what saved it.   Altogether, decent. I would go back and order from a full menu next time and get better options. Meal was about 50 bucks, so not ridiculously costly but not cheap eats either.",

I had the small superfood and it was great. But the real treat was the tortellini stuffed with veal in brown butter and safe with pancetta. OMG. Melts in your mouth!",

    "text": "Ok, I have to admit I have a little soft spot for Jamie Oliver... Is it his cute chubby face or that fact he has amazing flare when he cooks delicious food?  Either way I've been eager to check out his restaurant for some time on Rose Street.  The was a little confusion at the start though.  I called to book a table one Sunday night, on the off chance they would have a table for us in half an hour?  They said: \"sure just pop along there is space for you\" - not taking my name or booking.  Arrived 30 minutes later and there was no room for us.  The matradee claimed the person taking the call shouldn't have promised this and they would be a 20 minute wait.  Slight miscommunication between the staff there.   Luckily we didn't need to wait as long and we were seated.    I ordered the crab and risotto balls for starter and salmon salad for mains.  The starter was bland and tasteless with barely any crab detected inside!  The salmon salad was zesty and contained interesting beetroot and parsnip crisps but left me unfull.  The restaurant was busy and mainly full of tourists, likely drawn in by the name.  The table service was good and swift.  My companions food was also tasteless and lacking flavour.  Disappointed really, I think I'll stick to following Jamie's recipes on-line/TV and trying them at home in future as I usually get much better results.    This restaurant is only surviving on a name and really needs just a little bit more seasoning.  Won't be back again.",

    "text": "The food at Jamie's Italian is always at a pretty good standard. This one seems to be very seafood-oriented and very good indeed. I ordered the \"famous\" shrimp linguini which was pretty good, some garlic bread (which I have to admit was amazing) and my girlfriend ordered a squid and mussel pasta which she liked.  The atmosphere at this Jamie's is also really nice. The decor is very 20s (I think!) with nice booths and a brass-y glow. The restaurant is also found in a beautiful old road in Edinburgh.  Unfortunately, the service was a bit of a let down. It was pretty slow and they seemed a bit understaffed. We came for lunch on a Sunday so maybe they're not used to so many patrons.",
