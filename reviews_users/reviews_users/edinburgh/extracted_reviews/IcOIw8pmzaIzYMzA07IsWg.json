    "text": "This wee restaurant is tucked in between lots of other Italian places to eat. From the outside it doesn't look like much, seems to look like more of a takeaway but in reality it has a nice comfortable seating area. The kitchen is open faced and it has a wood burning oven where all the baked food is cooked.  I was well impressed with the menu and prices. For three of us eating two courses and a childs meal we spent around 12 pounds! Really quite pleased with the quality of the food and the waiter was very accommodating and helpful.  I had the polenta chips which were rich and nice, the sauce they were served with was really spicy so I had to return it but got another sauce with a wee bit of spice which was perfect. I also had the margarita pizza which was really nice. The cheese was tasty as was the sauce. The base of the pizza was perfect and it was cooked to perfection. My partner had the steak sandwich which had a honey mustard sauce and some veg, It was really tasty. He started with the cauliflower soup which was very savory and warm, perfect for the rainy afternoon.  Overall very happy with this place and wouldn't hesitate in going back. The prices are extremely affordable and the quality is top notch!",

    "text": "Working close by, I thought to give a try this Italian place today. Being a member of the Gourmet society club I made the call for a booking at 13:00 mentioning my membership and the happy lady on the phone made a note of our reservation.   When we arrived at 13:10, the place was almost packed. It took them around 5 minutes to show some attention to us and take us to our table, which wasn't 100% clean (breadcrumbs, signs of pepper stuck on the wooden surface).   We never felt welcome - there wasn't even a smile, some courtesy, not even a simple apology when two salads and a calamari starter took roughly 25 mins to arrive.   When we asked for the bill and mentioned the Gourmet society card, the abrupt mature waiter said that it can't be used during lunch time, with me adding that when I made the phone booking, I wasn't informed of that term. The waiter turned with a silent strict look to the lady behind the bar that was speechless (and must have taken the reservation), and after thinking about it for a few seconds, he finally said ok.   Food wise, my Goat's cheese salad was ok, but I think iceberg lettuce is not the best choice for it. My friend wasn't that happy with her Caesar salad (tasteless lettuce), and she even said that the crouton felt plain.   Walking out we saw two ladies looking desperately towards the inner of the restaurant waiting to be served soon, but that might take a while, I think.   Obviously, we are not going back...",

The coconut was amazing but the pistachio was a bit grainy.   Nice surroundings and great friendly staff.  I have been in here for pizza previously and it was tasty.",

    "text": "After failing to find anywhere which we fancied pretty late on a Sunday evening we stumbled across Quattrozero - a modern looking Italian cafe bar which also has a takeout. We were greeted by a friednly Italian chap who told us we can sit where we like. We were the only people in which seemed strange as next door was busy. However, a few more groups came in throughout our time in there. We ordered drinks and our food. The menu is extensive for pizza and pasta. There was lots I wanted to try but decided on the Diavola pizza which was amazing - a nice and thin crust with plenty of heat from the chilli. the sausage was home made as well aparrantly. It was one of the best pizzas ive had. To finish off I had the tiramisu which was also very good. I would also recommend the coconut ice cream. I could probably eat a full tub of it given the chance!",

    "text": "Stumbled upon this place merely by walking by during lunch time. I checked out the menu and it looked good so I decided to give it a go. They have a lunch menu until 16:00 with panini sandwiches from about 6 and two-course meals from about 7. Would definitely recommend getting the lunch menu since it's so cheap and the food is pretty good! Hr only downside for me is that I asked three times for some water before it came. Aside from that, the food was good and the price is excellent.",

    "text": "Freshly opened on Queensferry Street, Quattrozero is a diner-style Italian, offering an excellent range of dishes. One that's likely to prove popular is their \"pizza by the metre\", which sounds like it will provide excellent sharing (or lone gluttony) opportunities. I ate a really good goat's cheese salad, then a flavour-packed plate of ravioli. The service was extremely quick and friendly, too. I was impressed, and look forward to my next visit.  Overall, we said: \"Quattrozero is ploughing a fruitful furrow. It's somewhat reminiscent of Taste of Italy, in that it provides excellent value, lots of flavour, and really smart dishes. I look forward to coming back, soon, and playing with their lengthy pizzas.\"",

I'm quite boring with pizza I only usually have the margarita but I opted for the luxury one with buffalo mozzarella and fresh basil and olive oil, it was so tasty. I has a peach belin to drink it was lovely and it was only 5. For afters I had the ice cream trio and someone put on a yelp review that the coconut ice cream was good so thought I would give itva go. I had two coconut and one mint I think this is the best ice cream I have ever had and I wish this place was closer to Manchester so I could go back but I'm definitely going back next time I'm in edinburgh even if it's just for a bowl of ice cream. The staff were really friendly and made us feel really welcome a great experience overall.",

I think I remember now having the same dishes on both visits -  The pizza was ok - Milano Salami and gorzonzola cheese.  sometimes i feel it just nice a touch more for the bottom of the base as you sit it on a plate and it becomes slightly soggy and hard to cut - on that note a PIZZA KNIFE should be delivered!  Any how the arranchi meatballs were ok - I've had better last time and many other times, especially since I go to Rome many once or twice a year to get fed up on authentic cuisine. The service was good, and the wait was never long between meals.  mum enjoyed here Bruscetta and risotto, so that's something.",
