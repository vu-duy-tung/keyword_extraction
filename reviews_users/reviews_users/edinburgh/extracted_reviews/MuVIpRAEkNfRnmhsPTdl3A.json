I'm not going to lie, from the outside it just looks like any other 'old man' pub, and from glimpsing into the downstairs bar area on my way up to the bistro, that's pretty much exactly what it looked like on the inside too. The bistro bit though was a vast improvement, and the food was surprisingly good despite the stuffy atmosphere, and the set menu was really good value for money.  I'd definitely go back here for food again, but for drinks there are so many other places for drinks less than two minutes' walk away.",

No friendly banter. The staff were dour and a bit humorless. This is not the Scottish Way. Cheer the staff up, get a 5. They get much more down A 3. The food. Fantastic.",

The bar is the kind of faux traditional that a large percentage of Edinburgh's pubs are, it's cosy enough but not particularly welcoming or friendly. The aussie barman generally looks like he can't be arsed and would rather be somewhere else (Sydney perhaps, with a schooner of Toohy's New), to be fair I don't blame him as this place seems to attract more than its fair share of confused tourists. Mostly though I am irritated by the price of the ginger beer: it costs near enough the same as a pint of ale, which in this day and age of responsible drinking is wrong wrong wrong.",

Their food is properly cooked not microwaved processed stuff you get at many pubs these days. They have a great range of ales which change often, along with all the lagers and wines you'd expect. There is a lot of history to the pub and you can see that in the decor, with the old wooden look. They have a restaurant with tableclothes and richer food but i prefer the pub area with the pub meals on offer.",

The fish and chips with mushy peas were just perfect.  The only problem was I was full from the soup so couldn't finish the fish and chips - not a bad problem to have.   My companion had the upscale version of bangers and mash - it was very tasty, and one of her favorite meals throughout the UK.   Next time we are in Edinburgh we will make the trip to The Doric - well worth it.",

Next! discussions out of the pain) and helped me narrow down the available restaurants according to the Silent Reviewer's specifications down to um, The Doric. So, our options were relatively limited, but it was such a good thing, in this case. It was a cold, miserable December night, the pub downstairs was heaving, the restaurant upstairs the same. But, all the meals were great, service was pretty damn prompt, with nary a person left without a drink too long, and our meals were all served together. With a big group, it's often that this fails, especially in the catering style poor quality party food that makes an appearance. Not here, and in fact, there was a non-festive menu still available to choose from that just made my heart sing - all too often the Silent Reviewer is left with turkey as his birthday meal option year after year.

It was amazing! I had the Cullen skink for a starter. It was amazingly creamy, hot and delicious. My mother had fresh cut chips and a garlic aioli sauce which was great. I had originally wanted to start with the mussels but they were out of them that evening.  I had the shepherd's pie for my main and it was steaming hot and great! I highly recommend it.

    "text": "The Doric markets itself as Edinburgh's oldest Gastro Pub and it may very well be True but what one finds there today is at least not what I would call a Gastro Pub.  We started the evening in the downstairs pub part and it can't say we enjoyed it that much. Went up to the bar to order- asked for the selection of ales on tap. Did talk a bit to the bartender about the different ones and I asked for a recommendation with the response that she does not like beer so they all taste bad to her. Honest but not very helpful, we did however go for a pint of some local ale that was alright. The bar downstairs did however not really feel as if it had anything to do with a place that even tries to call itself a Gastro Pub (slightly worn, both guests and the chairs and tables and not very clean)  After the first pint we went upstairs instead and there it looked more like a traditional pub dining room. We were quickly shown our table be our waiter and given menus. Started looking at the selection and I was getting my hopes up. Some of the dishes did sound very nice. Wine list was a bit disappointing as I struggled to find anything by the glass that I wanted. Eventually went for a Shiraz that was not bad but still not what I had in mind. In general I would expect better from a Gastro Pub.  Back to the food - I went for the soup of the day. The day in question it was some sort of carrot soup. It was fairly good, a bit too sweet for my taste but not bad at all. The others in the group went for the Haggis spring rolls and the Confit of Duck Leg. The Haggis spring rolls were disappointing, nothing made better by putting Haggis in a spring roll. The Confit of Duck Leg was good but the marmalade and brioche accompanying it did not really match it.  For mains we also went for a few different choices. I went for the pork chops and the others went for burger and the Fillet of Sole. It was clear that I made the winning choice - the pork chops had been well-prepared and they were flavorful and grilled just the way they should be. The side of mash and vegetables were  however not given the same expert attention. Vegetables were not fresh and the mash did not feel as if it had been made recently. Still the pork chops were good. The burger was your standard pub burger so the type served anywhere - not bad but not anything different than what one can get at most pubs. The Fillet of Sole was ok, small piece of fish but it came with nice spinach and potatoes but it did not really have a lot of flavor and taste.  All in all it was ok but not great. Still give it a 3 rating since the food was above average but it is a bit misleading to call themselves a Gastro Pub.",

    "text": "The Doric is apparently \"Edinburgh's oldest gastro pub\", and it sells its legacy to the local tourists. Within, it's a nice warm tavern, complete with ales aplenty and stodgy food on the menu.  It's always been quiet enough when I've visited but that's usually when I'm waiting on an early evening train. I'm unsure what this place is like at the weekend but I can imagine it being a lot busier, with functions and whatnot. Seems to attract an older crowd who seek out its own brand of peace and quiet.  They offer homemade pies, Sunday roasts, 2 courses for a tenner, and the food is good nosh. Along with catering for my gastro belly, they have a couple of pasta dishes available on their A la Carte menu which will be suitable for vegetarians.  Traditional in a modern, pub grub kind of way and certainly more serene than the sometimes uptight Edinburgh cocktail scene, the Doric is great for a meal and a catch up over a few cold ones.",

    "text": "For the start of a friend's Stag Event in Edinburgh, we met at The Doric. Mostly because it was right next to the station and people were arriving before check-in at the hotel. Since we arrived the night before, we were in charge of being first here.  It's clearly a pub that people go to because of its proximity to the station. After I got in, got a drink, and sat down, a huge group of guys on another stag event came in with their bags. It was about 1:30 pm, so clearly they just got off the train and couldn't check in either, so hit up The Doric for beer.  They did have a tasty selection of beers. The best in my opinion was the coconut porter, which wasn't overly coconut flavored, but did give a nice hint of coconut after you had a sip.  Once more people arrived, about four of us went upstairs to grab a bite. The restaurant seemed nice, and the menu looked interesting. Two of us had the cheeseburgers, one the haloumi stack, and one the macaroni and cheese. We also split some haggis spring rolls, because when you're in Scotland, you eat haggis.  The food was a major disappointment. The haggis spring rolls were literally just haggis inside of a spring roll wrapper and deep fried. No Asian influence at all. Maybe some cabbage or sprouts or something would have been nice, but no, just haggis in a wrapper. The burger was a major letdown. They made it seem so spectacular on the menu, but it was just a boring burger with boring chips. The other half asked for some of my ketchup with his macaroni and cheese, which is clearly a bad sign. Bland on bland.   But the pub was good, the beer was good, and a good time was to be had by all. It was a nice kick-off to our night of drinking.",

Pros- Delicious haggis bon bons, yummy side salads, the beer and cider selection was GREAT (hello kopparberg!), and the pig's nose whisky was fantastic! Great service. Responsive and chatty servers that can put a smile on your face.  Cons- Why was my table so sticky? It needed a good wipe down. Macaroni and cheese was kinda oily...as in the oil wasn't blended well into a creamy cheese. It was kinda separated from the rest. Asparagus was overcooked.  Bottom line: I'd come for the drinks and haggis bon bons!",

Large pieces too.  The waiter asked if we wanted to try their haggis as they were well known for that.  So we also tried their haggis.  Delicious!!  I am a haggis snob and this haggis was near to the best I have ever had (no one can beat homemade from the St. Andrew's Society Ladies from St. Louis).  The potatoes and mashed turnips were very tasty too.    This is a pricey place.  Nearly 12 pounds for each dish for lunch.  Beer 5 pounds.  There is a children's menu.    Pub is ground floor.    Restaurant 2d floor with no lift.  Toilets on second floor.    Waiter super friendly.",

Welcoming, cosy atmosphere, the bistro restaurant is upstairs.  I ordered the Salmon and capers (8) to start and the Haggis, Neeps and Tatties (10) for main. The salmon was great quality and fresh, although a little simple and unfussy (just a lemon wedge and buttered bread on the side). The haggis was lovely, well favoured with creamy mash and parsnips balanced the saltiness of the haggis well.  In all, a solid choice for a very hearty and wholesome lunch or dinner, right in the centre of Edinburgh.",

    "text": "Had a lovely experience at the Doric our first night in Edinburgh.  Downstairs is a more traditional pub, upstairs a wine tavern and bistro. We sat upstairs and split a fairly priced bottle of Sangiovese.  We tried the Haggis Bon Bons to start and they were great! Traditional Haggis, balled up and fried, and served with Creme Fraishe sauce- a dressed up introduction to Haggis! I really enjoyed it.  Mum had the Fish 'N' Chips which were huge and beautiful! She said it was some of the best she ever had!  I had the Shepherds Pie which was divine! Pungent lamb and veggies, topped with superbly creamy mashed potatoes and lots of cheddar. Absolute heaven.  We had the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert which was another fantastic experience with this British dish. Definitely get it!  Servers were friendly and attentive, atmosphere cozy and classy, food divine, and prices fairly.  Definitely come here!",

    "text": "I had bookmarked The Doric as a place to check out while I was planning our first trip to Scotland. It just happened to be across the street from Waverly....meaning easy to find, and convenient. I did not realize that you had to have reservations to eat there. I had not seen anything mentioning that online, but they were very accommodating and seated us as soon as was possible I think we waited 10-15 minutes for a table. No big deal.   Our meal was fantastic! 9 months later and we still talk about the shrimp and chorizo starter we had. It was one of the best bites we had in Scotland. If I could recreate that dish stateside I would...and have tried. But it was really the bread they served with it that was incredible. Thick crusty bread to sop up the delicious broth of the dish. Hubs had the haggis which was a first, and it was delicious. My fish and chips were tasty...but that shrimp and chorizo dish. I could have just had that for dinner.   We shared the sticky toffee pudding for dessert, and again....delicious. In fact, that started a love affair we now have with sticky toffee pudding. The only reason I deducted a star is because at times our server went missing, and even though they accommodated us without a reservation, it took forever to get our food. As though without a reservation you go to the back of the line for everything. Which, may be the case...but it just made for a long drawn out dinner after a day of traveling.",

No problem, came back tuesday night!  I got the tiger prawn linguine and my dad got the shepherds's pie. Linguini was great, and I was glad to see that it came with plenty of prawns. Also sampled some of the shepherd's pie which was just as good  The real winner, however, was the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. I have had several, and none came close to the quality of the one offered by The Doric. Make sure you ask for a scoop of ice cream on the side as it is not normally served with it, maybe even two as a scoop was quite small. The ice cream itself had the consistency of butter, I wish I had ordered 3 more scoops...",

    "text": "Just had a surprisingly delightful dinner here tonight and I didn't even know this is actually the oldest gastropub in Edinburgh! So it's also a place of historical significance!  FOOD/DRINKS- haggis Bon bons: crispy and steaming hot when cut open, served nicely with mashed turnips, straw potatoes, cream fraiche and a light salad. It was delicious. Prawns & chorizo: served with fresh bread, prawns taste shrimpy and fresh while chorizo bits are spicy with a kick. The chorizo was a bit salty, but was perfect with the bread. Mulled wine was delicious and warmed my soul.  AMBIANCE/DECOR- small restaurant with some bar counter seating, dimly lit, but not loud. Good for romantic date, casual dinner, and even an interview over dinner (like the two men to the table next of me tonight). The room was decorated with paintings and tables with candles.   SERVICE/STAFF- hit or miss. One staff was super friendly/helpful while the other one was only average and seemed a bit anxious/stressed out. When I entered the place downstairs into the bar section, the bartender saw me but ignored me. Good thing I figured it out soon enough...when I saw the door to the 'bistro' that I just walk upstairs!   Overall, I had a very pleasant experience and the food/mulled wine that I had was very enjoyable. I like the atmosphere and want to go back to try their other drinks and food items. Would recommend!",

We went with a group of 10 and had to prepay 5 each to make a reservation, which then was taken off our bill. I just had the salmon started which was really delicious, although the bread was not toasted and quite dry which was a bummer!  My friends had many different dishes and all said it was great! Good place to know and I'll almost certainly go back, you can get some real typical Scottish dishes here when you have non-local visitors over that would like to try them.",

Overall an OK dining experience but nothing special for me.   Still, try it out, you might have a different opinion",

While in Scotland I decided to try  the traditional Cullen Skink soup served with a nice tomato foccacha and Haggis Bon Bons. I took those two starters as mains instead, and that was enough to satisfy my hunger.   Deep fried haggis balls are worth a try. I've tried haggis before somewhere else, but it wasn't particularly amazing, as the dish is normally served with potato mash and feels quite heavy, whereas here the haggis balls starter portion is just the right size to get the taste and feel you up.  The service is nice, I really needed to charge my phone and the bartender was happy to help charge it at the bar. It gets quite busy, therefore better to book in advance to avoid disappointment.",

To finish it off, was a decadent sticky toffee pudding. We are still talking about our meal there.",

The plate came with regular and sweet potatoes and I wish there was a vegetable option instead. Haggis is more tender than meatloaf so I had to get used to the texture, but the seasoning was good. The pub has a couple different eating areas, but the one as you walk up does not allow children and the other goes by reservations first; so it may be wise to set one up - especially if traveling with kids.",

    "text": "Based on other reviews, I had really high hopes and was pretty disappointed.  We attempted to come for dinner the previous day, but were turned away since we didn't have a reservation - even though the seats were 1/2 empty - so we returned for lunch the next day.  We ordered haggis bon-bons, salmon, a burger, and mussels.  The mussels tasted \"off\" and we never got the bread we ordered.  The meal was OK, but we were dying for sticky toffee pudding at the end. . .which arrived burned.    On top of so-so food, the service was TERRIBLE.  We arrived and ordered well before the tables next to and behind us, but we had to flag our waiter several times to check our food, order dessert and even get the check.  When we finally did get the check, the total was over by about 10 pounds for food that we didn't even order - be sure to check your bill.  We stopped for lunch and had plans to walk the city for the day, but by the time lunch was over it was nearly 3pm.  I understand the folks move at different speeds, but there were only about 8 tables and we were struggling to get any attention - and we indicated a few times that we were in a hurry.  The Doric had great reviews, and perhaps we got them on an off day, but there are far better places to eat in Edinburgh for the cost and time it took.",

We were hoping to do some more things around the city but the wait time between courses meant we spent over two hours there - almost an hour just waiting for dessert. Flagged a waitress who checked on the dessert but then went on break, so had to check with another waiter, while we watched many parties sit down, eat, and leave. Soup and vegetable gratin were good, fish and chips was meh, and the sticky toffee pudding was pretty amazing...would have been the highlight if we weren't just ready to get up and leave. Would have appreciated if they comped the desserts, or at least ...apologized for the delay?",

    "text": "We had our first lunch in Edinburgh here in The Doric. I must say it was a good meal.  I ordered the lunch menu, consisting of cullen skink, followed by the haggis. Cullen skink is an interesting creamy soup, which contains fish and leeks. I actually loved it, even though I forgot that I actually am lactose intolerant (I suppose it wasn't described as a creamy soup, and given that everyone in Scotland probably know what it is, there was no need for a description), and therefore headed to the restroom a few times after that. Nevertheless, I loved the soup, and would repeat it assuming there are close facilities nearby.  The haggis was interesting, to say the least. I didn't know what neeps and tatties were, which came with it, and turned out to be turnips and potatoes. Of course, everyone from Scotland knows what they are. The savory flavor was definitely interesting, and I would try it again if I had the chance.  The best part perhaps is the double espresso beer I ordered. Living in Germany, beers tend to be on the conservative side. So I definitely enjoyed this beer as an accompaniment to my interesting cultural meal.",
