The bean bag seating area in the rear is a nice feature and there's a shelf of books you can add to or take from whilst the main seating area is comfy and the large front window provides ample people-watching opportunities.  Space is also available on the walls for local artists to have work displayed.",

I love the simple little touches like the backless bar stools, the fairy lights on the window, the artwork on the walls and the WiFi password on a sticker on a plant pot. I'll definitely be back.",

Our family stopped-in both mornings we were in town and each had a perfect breakfast. The staff is friendly and welcoming. This is a coffee shop- elevated. Love it!",

Nothing to fancy but modern and quaint! Try one of the stacks (the bread treat that is covered in cinnamon and looks like a chimney... yum!)",

    "text": "I was pleasantly surprised to see this lovely cafe as I walked past so decided to pop in for lunch.  Usually I do not like black/dark grey type decor but this place is done up tastefully and the warm bamboo tables lift the darkness of the walls and ceilings, giving it a cosy (rather than a gloomy) effect.  There is also a chilled out ok at the back with low tables, bean bags, a grass effect floor and a nice view of the garden.  The man who initially served me was friendly, helpful and informative.  I had a very nice baguette and a rather odd but still decent coffee (and the chimney cakes looked amazing).  So far, so good.  So, why only 3 stars, you ask?  Well, the woman who was working here had a seriously shitty attitude!!!  At first I thought I was imagining the dirty look I got from her so I let it slide...then I got another...I asked her a couple of questions and got a frosty/verging on rude response...I have no idea which of them is in charge but here's a tip: looking down your nose at customers is not the way to successfully run a cafe.  Trust me, I've worked all my life in customer services & customer related jobs, it seems bizarre to have to spell this out :o(  At first I was thinking about how I would recommend this place to pals, by the time I left I was thinking quite the opposite.  A real shame.",
