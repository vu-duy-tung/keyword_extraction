    "text": "We really enjoyed eating here. Because it's a tapas restaurant, it's possible to enjoy more than one item. We found the flavors to be very authentic and delicious. They were able to adjust the spice to our needs. The only disappointment we had was that our waiter, after talking us into a starter, convinced us that the portions were small enough that we should order two items each. After eating the starter, ordering rice and naan to go with our meals, we had way too much food. Even a waitress who collected our dishes seemed surprised that we would have been advised to order so much. And being tourists, we were not able to take the leftovers home. I would suggest that you just order one item plus rice and or naan and if you're still hungry after that, order something more. If you have the means to take food home, then you might not feel bad ordering more from the get go. If there are two or more of you in the group, it's best for each person to order a different item and everyone share. You get to try more things and taste more flavors that way.",

    "text": "I love curry, but Kama Sutra may be a step too far... Okay (bad) joke out of the way this place pleasantly surprised me. Lothian road has changed a lot over the years I have lived in Edinburgh and I have to say it's gentrification is almost complete. Once I would have been skeptical of finding 1 decent place to eat on this busy street, but times have changed.  So to the curry, my usual assortment of spicy and ricey (madras, chilli garlic and biryani) have all been of great quality. Rich spice flavours, good quality meat and rice and nan which are perfectly prepared. The staff are friendly and more importantly communicate with each other so everyone knows what's going on. The takeaway is a little more expensive, but only by a 1 per meal or so, certainly not anything that would stop me returning.  One small warning is that the Kama Sutra occasionally gets large bus groups, so if you happen to head in after they have been seated, you may be in for a slightly longer wait, maybe 5-10 minutes more. Still this isn't a regular occurrence and the food is well worth the wait. This curry lover is happy to recommend the Kama Sutra.",

    "text": "I think I have fallen into the same trap that others have noted here - that Lothian Road, with its saunas and chain restaurants and it's propensity to the Pubic Triangle - doesn't leap out as a place where you expect food to be good. But there are a few places to enjoy here on the West Side, and Kama Sutra falls into this camp, even if the title of this restaurant and it's neighbours is rather grimly ironic.   Service was very attentive - and the SR noted that he had experienced similar on his earlier visit, when the restaurant was much busier than it was on our visit - and we were advised on how much to order (portions are generous, so don't over order) which we found really helpful.   I will note though, they have dosas on their menu - but they no longer make these, which I was heartily disappointed by and ended up plumping for a paneer dish. The boy went with a mixed tandoori which looked big enough for two and went down like a storm. We finished, stuffed and happy with our choice of venue for the night. Definitely ticked all of the good boxes.",

Service: Friendly and helpful. One waiter got my order a little mixed up (which could have been partly due to a miscommunication on my part) but they were happy to correct it when brought to their attention. Food: Absolutely terrific. I was looking forward to my trip to the UK largely because it's hard to find good Indian in the US. This place was exactly what I was looking for. I tried the chicken tikka and the Hyderbadi Biryani (lamb) and both were wonderful. Nice flavours without being too heavy. The accompanying sauces were a mix - for the chicken tikka I found the sauce to be bland and unimaginative, but for the biryani it was very tasty and well needed as the dish alone was fairly dry. Oh, and the naan is superb. Price: Very good value for the quality. All in all, if I come back to Edinburgh I'd make the effort to come here again.",

As we entered, one of the waiters asked us if we had a reservation, even though most of the restaurant was empty, he made us feel he would refuse us if we had not called in before. When the food came they gave us no serving spoons. Had to wait for several minutes for one of the waiters to turn up at a near by table to ask for spoons. Food wasn't good either. Chicken in butter chicken was undercooked or not marinated long enough as it was hard, fortunately gravy was good. Vegetable biryani was particularly horrible. It had absolutely no salt. We sent it back and they added too mich salt. Will not recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "Ok, so the name and location might throw you, it did me anyway.  Nestled between some disreputable establishments, although I'm sure they're lovely inside really, on Lothian Road Kama Sutra tries to get across the point at the fornt of it's menu that this is not about sex. Rather, pleasure, and honestly, it was a pleasurable meal from start to finish.  We headed here for their Valentine's Day special (more fool me dating someone with a sense of humor!) and I was impressed with what was on offer. We were handed a scroll tied with ribbon with 'themed' courses...A free glass of home made sangria, poppadums with all the trimmings (the ahem, 'foreplay'), a selection of starters (the...nibbly bits...), our choice of a main each with rice and naan, two deserts to choose from followed by an Irish cream with some heart shaped chocolates. Considering this was all for under 22 I feared the meal would be a bit meh. I was pleasantly surprised!  The sangria was delicious, though was more punch than sangria really. The poppadums with sauces were good too. And the starters were fantastic. So many different flavours on one plate and such variety!  I chose buttery chicken for my main as I'm not one for spicy food and it was great. It was on the creamy side, which was fully expected, and I wasn't able to finish it all. But across the table a 'Lover Chicken Korma' was demolished with vigour.  For desert I had a mango kheer and across from me sponge balls were chosen. Both lovely.  The main reason this place comes up tops, aside from the deliciousness and value, is the staff. What a lovely bunch! Everyone was so personable and nice that every order and check up on our meal turned into a full blown conversation, in a good way! This will definitely encourage us back!",

    "text": "Note to self. Edinburgh restaurants close early. We realized it was 9:45 PM, so asked hotel for a reco. That said, we taxied a few miles out away from the Royal Mile, headed for Italian... Dario's I think. Our driver said to try another Italian restaurant across the street but I saw the Kama Sutra sign beaming thru the rain and had remembered it scored high on Trip Advisor. Indian actually sounded good, so we gave it a shot.  The greeter/waiter/comedic hero seemed surprised but pleased to see us. He seated us quietly aside from the two other patrons. Menus, wine please! Navinder (he had to spell and pronounce for me) told us the specials and I asked for his recos. During this time, we chatted up and after we mentioned we were from Ohio the talk rounded up to \"hello Cleveland.\" Quote for quote we went on Spinal tap (I love him). Back to the food. I had a special starter, the scallops, which was the only low point of the meal. A little overlooked so despite the rich Indian flavors, a little hard going down. From here out however, everything else was fantastic.  Man had the Achari Bathak Tikka - duck marinated in Indian spices. Divine, not gamey and very tender.  We split a plate of chicken stuffed dosa, plain nan and another special - monkfish that was deep fried, surrounded by potatoes and other steed veggies. Oh my God!  Delicious. Man ate most of the food while I gabbed with the staff. By this time, Navinder was joined by another server, the owner and the chef. We ended up staying on much longer talking about everything form the city to marriage to movie trivia and closed the place with a special drink concocted by the second waiter. I remember him mentioning elderberry something or other. The chef was the sweetest man alive and truly interested in our feedback. The owner was hilarious. Just a joy to chat with. I particularly loved his take on how important service is. He also knew every movie I threw at him. Rushmore!?!  Come on, that's impressive.  We got pix with the team and received a nice send off as we headed back in the rain to our hotel. Sated and silly from a great night out. Highly recommend this place and their original spot in Glasgow. One of the best dining experiences ever. Wish we could transplant them back to the states. HELLO CLEVELAND!",

The interior of the restaurant was beautiful, spacious, well-lit - and not at all sleazy or as wacky as its name suggests!   The menu is a nice change from the standard Indian restaurants one finds in Europe. From what I recall, some of the staple Indian curries were available, but most of the dishes on offer would be relatively unknown to the non-Indian diner. This encouraged me to try something new (nope, I can't remember what it was now!), and I wasn't disappointed. The waiter knew some of the options were a bit unconventional, and gladly answered all the questions we had about level of spicyness, comparison to other dishes, etc.   Portions were slightly small and prices were slightly high considering its location. Yet the great service made up for it. We arrived at the restaurant late, and after our meal asked if we could order drinks. The waiter explained the restaurant was closing but he would keep the bar open slightly later so we could have some cocktails. Such a nice gesture, and I recall the cocktails being fantastic.   I will definitely return on my next visit to Edinburgh.",

Just as we stepped outside the hotel, we spotted this Indian restaurant, across the street. We ordered Chicken Korma & Paratha for dinner. When the Chicken Korma arrived on the table, my husband asked the waiter for some hot sauce in order to spice up the dish,like most Indians would do. The waiter went back, and instead of the hot sauce, arrived a very polite & cordial gentleman - Alok Singh, the Manager of the restaurant. Seeing we are Indians who might not prefer a mild dish like Chicken Korma, which we had already ordered, he asked the waiter to take the Korma away from our table. He proactively offered to order a dish of Butter Chicken to us. We both were a little startled, embarrassed but definitely appreciated his gesture eventually. Great customer service indeed! Once the Butter Chicken arrived, not only did my husband NOT ask for any hot sauce this time, he heartily enjoyed the lip-smacking dish and inferred this is \"the BEST Butter Chicken I have ever had\"! He meant he had never even tasted anything close to this flavorful dish, even in any restaurant in India.  We couldn't help going back to Kama Sutra on the following night for dinner....and no prize for guessing - we ordered Cheese Naan & OF COURSE...... BUTTER CHICKEN!!! :)",

The staff were friendly and attentive (maybe a little too attentive). The food was beautiful. For starters, we got 2 poppadoms with spiced onions, chicken pakora and haggis pakora. The haggis pakora was very nice and different and the pakora came with two delicious sauces. The presentation was marvellous with streaks of sauce, grated vegetables and a sprig of mint. For our main courses, we had lamb korma, chicken tikka masala, pilau rice and a peshwari nan. The lamb korma was unbelievably good and the peshwari nan went very well with it. We couldn't fault this meal. We ate every crumb. Our bill altogether was close to 27 which was great considering we got poppadoms, nan bread, a drink and a coffee as extras. Good value for what was a gorgeous meal. Great ambience too. Wonderful decor and traditional Indian music. Very relaxing. We're definitely going to go back to this place. We may try out the lunch buffet on another one of our 'mother-daughter' days out. Super place. Sometimes it's tough to find a gem of a restaurant in Edinburgh and we were lucky to choose this one at random!",
