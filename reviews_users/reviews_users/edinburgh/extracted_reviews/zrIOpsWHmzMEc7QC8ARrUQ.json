If you aren't feeling a salad or sandwich. They have soup and macaroni that is absolutely scrumptious. In addition the atmosphere is very calm if you just need a break from all of your walking.",

    "text": "You feel like when you have seen one Pret A Manger, you have seen them all, but that is not the case with this branch. What makes it exceptional is their service.   We went in late on a Friday on a rainy Fringe day. They still had plenty of options. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. One staff member overheard us saying \"Mayo doesn't seem to be a thing in the UK.\" He replied, \"I can find you some,\" and came back from the kitchen with a serving. There were several small moments like this that made this feel like the place is well managed and the staff really care.",

    "text": "For fast food this place does it very well! It's so nice to have a place like Pret where the food is actually good for you. Not pretend healthy, but properly organic, light and healthy (I refer mostly to the salads and meals, if you're purchasing baked goods you're on your own).  It's good, it's fresh and it's convenient. Certainly a better choice out of any other fast food joint in the area.   Service is friendly and quick. I love the selection available and cost wise it won't set you back too many pennies. Worth it if you're after a healthy lunch that's not full of hidden nasties, and also that won't break the bank.",

    "text": "So, I'm not gonna lie. I avoided this place for a long time. I don't really like chains. Unless there is something inherently nostalgic then all is forgiven.   Anyways, on one of those days when the rain was pouring down in sheets and I had both wee ones I ran into the closest cafe for shelter. This time it just happened to be Pret A Manger. I thought to myself a quick bite and once it stops raining we will be on our way. Besides wee one wanted a croissant.   I was checking out the sandwich selection when it dawned on me that a lot of look really tasty. I am a total sucker for all things chipotle so I tried the melt and it was really tasty! I am also in love with the ginger lemonade. It has cayenne pepper in it! Its fucking delish!   So since this first visit I have been a couple of more times and have tried a couple more sandwiches and wraps and can say yes, it wasn't a fluke, the food is damn tasty.",

    "text": "A Pret A Manger is a Pret A Manger is a Pret A Manger... but sometimes, they need little Yelp love too. A hat tip to Paddy H for reminding me that as much as I turn my nose up at chains, there are occasions where they kick ass and deserve a nod. Pret A Manger often falls into this category, so this review was a long time coming.  I quite like Pret. If i'm in a rush, it's a no brainer for fast food that doesn't make me feel like a slug. A veggie toastie and a juice; a sandwich and a nut milk; a salad and a ginger/lemon shot - all are regular staples in the \"Jody miscalculated her schedule and now has to eat in ten minutes while running between meetings\" list. It's fast, decently priced and always a half decent meal on the run. Note: I can't speak to their coffee or pastry selection, as I haven't tried either.  This particular Pret has some darn cheerful faces behind the counter as well and the service has always been pleasant. It's clean, bright and from my experience, not that busy (keep in mind, i'm usually running through after realizing I had missed lunch completely - roughly 2-3pm). That's enough for a four star nod from me.",

One guy didn't approve that our mozzarella and pesto panini came out a little burnt, so he ran over, grabbed a fresh one and did it again!  Plus, he still gave us the first panini, which we were then able to pass on to a homeless person outside.",
