    "text": "I've been here a few times and find that the sushi is 'Edinburgh-good sushi'. It's tasty, reasonably priced and the portions are good. Yes Sushi also does discounts for students that, at times, are fan-blooming-tastic! All in all, a 4 star place.  What is prompting my glowing review was the service I received last night.   I popped in for a take-away, as the pub where I was planning some grub across the way had stopped serving food at 8. I was greeted at the door and brought to the back area where I was seated with a menu. While I had a quick look someone brought me wasabi peas and a glass of ice water with lemon (I never asked!). While I ordered the waiter was kind enough to ask if I'd like anything else while I waited and even engaged in some witty banter (I take some responsibility for the wit.) All this service despite the fact that the place was teeming with people as Yes Sushi does a 'Hot Pot' dealie which is basically a fancy all you can eat buffet. The staff were run off their feet with customers constantly grabbing them as they rushed by, and yet they still took time to treat me far better than most places treat their sit-down customers.  I was so impressed. And my food wasn't half-bad either!",

    "text": "I decided I was in desperate need of some sushi to keep me going at my nice wee shift at work on Saturday so I ended up here after passing it many times and being intrigued..... as I often am with anywhere that sells food, coffee, cake or something nice and tasty!   The sushi selection here is great, I wanted to try a bit of everything but seeing as it was just me that would have been a bit extreme! The service was nice, attentive and not too serious. I liked that. I ended up deciding I would go for some spicy tuna maki, salmon nigiri and mixed vegetable tempura. This seemed like a reasonable amount of food to me..... and I was safe with this assumption until after I had devoured the sushi (which was delish, tuna had a really good kick and fish tasted better than most I have had). Then the tempura arrived. It was an actual mountain of tasty aubergine, carrot, sweet potato, yellow and red peppers. They were not holding back at all. ......... and you know what!? I ate every last piece, and I am PROUD. Needless to say I was utterly stuffed, but it was totally worth it.   I would give this sushi bar another try although if I was on my own I would maybe give the bento box a try as it is a little pricey otherwise and the portions were just a bit too much!",

I'll explain. I met two then-and-now friends and a not-then-but-now-sort-of acquaintance at the joint in question for a bit of innocent hobnobbing and knick-knacking, les mots darting from this to that to the other thing. The constellation of our discourse, however, would have but a lone especially luminous star cluster, paling all others. This specimen: Italian food. Mouths watered and eyes leaked as our MVP titillated the gray matter with tales of eating whatever they eat in Italy. Pining for memories and words that weren't mine, lusting for sensations hitherto undreamt of, anonymous, unnamed, I waited for my udon. Now you see the dilemma. Any meal following such an evocative and exquisite food-related encounter with a past that is not yours is sure to mar the food-related consumption at hand. This was, I'm happy to disclose, only partly the case. The udon of YES SUSHI held up well enough in the fight against my greedy imagination. But it wasn't Italian food.",

There is no sushi bar like you get in many places, so you can't sit and watch the guy slicing up your fish, but it was clean and friendly and if you want a hit of Japanese food it fits the bill.  For two of us, we spent about 30. We had a couple of rolls between us, their selection seems interesting enough to keep you busy, but not so outrageous like you find in some places. They have a decent selection of fish, including yellow tail that you don't see all that often over here. We also had some cooked food, some teriyaki noodles with chicken, which was tasty, but not particularly high quality. Their menu has a good spread of things to try and we'll be back the next time Japanese food calls our name. Whilst we were sat there, quite a few people came in for take away, which is handy to know if you live in town and want some sushi for dinner. There was also some families in with kids who had a really tasty looking small bowl of ramen noodles, which made me hungry again as I walked out.",

My son's roll had two thick old looking pieces of fake crab which traditionally have red stripes but were faded pink, tamago(didn't realize this is what goes in a California roll), fish eggs which were littered everywhere, and the avocado looked as though it had been sitting out as it was very brown and dry.  My son took one look at it and put it aside.  My salmon roll was slimy and the seaweed quality was chewy:( I also can't stand how much mayonnaise they love to use!  It is really really nasty. They also brought over an order I had never ordered of fried prawns!  I had to tell the waitress that I had never ordered that and she asked if I was sure about that...  At this point, I am angry and want to escape this craphole they try to pass off as a Japanese restaurant which really seems like a Chinese style place.  It even smells funky like some nasty musty smell.  Do not go here!! The menu looks good, but the reality of the food is horrible!!! They are also expensive.  Ugh -I want to throw up just thinking if this place! They should consider renaming it to No Way in Hell Sushi...",

As far as I'm aware Yes Sushi has only been open for a couple of weeks! We were a bit suspicious as we could smell a strong scent of Incense as we entered this establishment! The decor is modern & fresh very stylish indeed! The menu is fairly extensive with the usual Sushi, Sashimi, Noodle dishes etc. A bright cheery menu with pictures making it easy to chose! Look out for the great value Bento Boxes which come with Miso soup The staff were friendy & helpful, prices were reasonable & the food was excellent! Didn't find any obvious need for the strong incensce so reckon the staff just liked it! A trip to the toilets proved them to be clean & functional. Unfortunately they are not decorated to the standard of the restaurant but perhaps that will be done later. Just mind your head on the way up to the ladies as there is a bit of a ceiling overhang on the stairs! All in all I would say it's well worth a visit!",

To be clear, Yes Sushi gets 4 stars on the UK sushi chart, not worldwide sushi chart.  OK, so, Yes Sushi is pretty decent. Good miso that must be made with shitake mushroom broth. Very deep flavor. Good stuff. Sushi is good quality fish. The rice was a bit 'meh' and the roll was starting to fall apart, but still pretty damn tasty. The place is easy to find and a nice break away from the super busy Princes St. mess. Atmosphere is OK. Service was a bit wishy-washy. Giggly girls took a bit to bring drinks, food and check. Overall, would definitely return when downtown.",

The waitress quickly gave us our menus and asked how we would like to order. They had an a la cart menu as well as an all you can eat sushi which was about 18.99. A bit overpriced I would say, especially for just maki rolls.   We got a few rolls to share, including the spicy tuna roll, California roll, salmon and avocado and a bunch of other ones I can't remember. I was glad we did not order anymore, as the sushi rice tasted really gummy and sour. I feel like they just doused the sushi rice with vinegar, because it sure wasn't good at all. We had one roll which was quite interesting and odd at the same time as it was filled with fried chicken and a tangy mayo type dressing. The tuna was not fresh and tasted really fishy. Yo Sushi down the street seemed like a better option.",

It's pretty standard stuff and it's reasonably cheap. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but if I was walking past and felt the sushi call I'd go again. I'd look at the menu, shrug and order a California roll.  I had a large bowl of spicy beef broth ramen, as they were the most appetising of the non-sushi dishes. They had a decent amount of kick and a decent amount of beef. It was pretty good.  I got the impression that the English menu which we were offered may have been considerably less interesting than some of the other things available which a lot of the people around us were eating. Perhaps you just need to ask though.  The sushi was comparable and probably a bit better than what you would find in Yo Sushi, but to be honest Yo Sushi is more fun. I'd probably prefer Wagamamas if I was determined to have ramen/noodle dishes. This is fairly in offensive option for a cheap sushi lunch though.",

Sushi seemed cheap , probably because its the buffet and they can't roll top food out for that or they loose a lot of money which I understand. Meso soup is one of the best I've had actually I give the soup a 4 star it's tasty. Also had a kimchee roll which was quite good actually. The spice mixed with the soy sauce was actually really good. So I had a much better experience today . I will be going back.",

    "text": "Apparently in Glasgow you can get sushi to takeaway everywhere, or so it would seem if you listen to my visiting sister. In Edinburgh I think the choice is more limited, I know there's Miso & Sushi but it doesn't deliver to my flat, so on our way home from a book festival event we popped by Yes Sushi to fulfil her cravings.  Thoughts - well it's a lot bigger inside that the outside would suggested, but diners are pretty crammed in, and the famous hot pots they serve mean they have electrical cables all over the floor. It'd be a much better (and safer) idea to ask an electrician to install more sockets, or even sockets at the tables.  Price wise the sushi isn't too bad, but a lot of it seems pretty expensive.  I ordered one of the selections from the front page of the takeaway menu which cost nearly 14. It was nice, several types of sushi and some sashimi, but not lots - certainly not enough to justify the price.  My sister was pleased with her choices, but again not cheap. Everything tasted good mind, and if I was in town I might be inclined to pop in for food (especially as the hot pots looked interesting), but I wouldn't go out of my way - but it did fulfil our sushi needs.",

    "text": "This review will take the form of a note to myself reminding me what to order if I find myself at Yes Sushi again:  Agedashi tofu - disappointing. Don't get it again.  Avocado maki - good.  Miso soup - ok.  Veggie gyozas - good enough (to eat again).  In summary, a very hit-or-miss vegetarian selection. Service was fine. Atmosphere a bit fast-foody for my tastes. The search for my favorite Japanese restaurant in Edinburgh continues.",

    "text": "My friends don't know sushi ***please apply Jenny L's disclaimer here also as it turns out I am the ignorant one***  I'm hungover and need to have something tasty for lunch which is actually my breakfast. I'm torn between a huge bowl of pasta or sushi, my health conscious side says go for sushi, don't risk sending your body into carb lock down  -even if those meatballs do look awesome.   So sushi is the choice, decor in this place is attempted modern, Japanese schoolgirl prints and manga-esque patterns. I don't find that offensive, service is fast, which is good because hungover Tom has little patience. I opted against a bento box, and went ofr a mixed sashimi plate which also came with Miso. The Miso is good, I ordered an iced green tea, it wasn't so good. The Sushi comes in good time, and I devour it, like the homeless kid in Santa Clause the Movie, just without the fingerless gloves, and the snow, and I'm not homeless, just hungover.  The food was good, not a bad sushi experience by my standards, but certainly not ground breaking.",

    "text": "My friend and I decided to visit this place at lunch time. It was my first time here so I was eager to sample some fresh Japanese food.  I ordered the bento box as it had a little bit of everything: sashimi, tonkatsu pork, rice, salad. My friend went for a selection of sushi. As we waited for the food to arrive, the waitress brought over some wasabi nuts and the miso soup which was part of the order. The soup was absolutely delicious, there were some little blocks of tofu in it and it was just what I needed on a freezing cold winter's day!  Then onto the bento box. It was all quite enjoyable. The sashimi was salmon and tuna, which were quite thick slices. Now it may just be me, but I would have preferred the sashimi in thinner slices. Tonkatsu pork was nice as well.   All in all, good lunch place (or dinner) and decent food on offer.  Polite service as well.",

I can imagine this place being very popular with the clientele working in the nearby area or any tourist who loves sushi and has not yet discovered the Harvey Nichols top floor Yo Sushi!  My friend and I visited this place not so long ago. I ordered the Salmon Sashimi and Nigiri set. I got 6 Nigiri and a bit of Sashimi. In all fairness, I was a bit disappointed about the size of the meal for the price I paid.  Overall the food was delicious and the personnel very nice.",

    "text": "- They played classic piano music by Daniel Barenboim which made the Asian experience incomplete!   - Dumplings were flash pan-fried with old oil..one can smell it. - Sushi rice was not nicely prepared. - Service was not friendly + any order that was ready was brought to the table regardless if we finished starters/soup or not.   I dont know about sushi standards in Edinburgh because every time I walk down the street I see the place packed?! Maybe I ordered the wrong stuff. The only good thing was the wassabi coated nuts and the miso soup.",

    "text": "This was a bit of a late night option when we were looking for food at about 11.30 on a Fri night. Not many other places serving at that time of night so were relieved just to find somewhere.  I can't really say I've had a lot of sushi but this place seems to be pretty good. It all seemed to be well made and tasty. I made the mistake of not asking for a fork which hampered progress considerably!  One thing that could have been better would be the menus. Being quite new to the whole sushi thing I wasn't entirely sure what I was ordering as there wasn't much of a description to anything.  Apparently they do an 18 all you can eat 'hot pot' which I've heard good things about. I may be back to give this a try sometime!",
