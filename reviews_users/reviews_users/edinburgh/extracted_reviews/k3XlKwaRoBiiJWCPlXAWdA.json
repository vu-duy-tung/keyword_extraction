Finally!   Wonders never cease and the Delta Indian Takeaway is No.1!!!",

    "text": "This is easily the best Indian takeaway in Edinburgh! The food is absolutely delicious! They are very friendly and accomodating.   I was lucky enough to live two doors away when I first moved to Edinburgh and was spoilt! I've not found a takeaway yet that matches it - and believe me, living on the other side of town, I've tried! - but I'm working on it.   They deliver but only in the local area but I've still made the journey accross town just to collect! If that devotion isn't testimony to the standard of this takeaway I'm not sure what is!",

    "text": "I ordered from here on a recommendation, not knowing the last time the person ordered from here was a year ago. The food turned up luke warm and the curry was not the greatest. Perhaps the takeaway has had a changed of ownership. I was severely dissapointed and ended up dumping the majority of it in the bin, having ordered a curry, rice, pilau rice and pakoras. What a waste of money.",
