    "text": "Subway is an excellent sandwich shop. The sandwiches which are aptly called a footlong are so full ingredients and you get to pick them yourself. You can choose any filling and any mixture of salad and dressing. If a footlong is too much for you to handle you can have a 6 sub, everyday they have a special offer 1.99 for 6 sub of the day and you can still choose all your salad etc, its a great, cheap filler up!",

    "text": "As with all Subway branches, you know what you're going to get. Food is fine, everything tastes good, and the prices are low, which tends to attract me when I want a small, good value lunch. However, I've found service to be slow, even at less busy times. For a fast food joint, this isn't good enough. Hopefully they can improve, as I'll likely be in the area needing a quick lunch again in future!",

    "text": "I am a HUGE fan of Subway, but this particular branch never seems to have all the ingredients! If they've not run out of all-but-one type of bread, it's lettuce, or it's chicken. I mean come on guys! Help me out here!! Plus I've always noticed that this particular Subway is used by all the schoolkids in the area, so is always busy and is always messy. There is a brilliant one  mere 10mins walk away - it's worth it!",
