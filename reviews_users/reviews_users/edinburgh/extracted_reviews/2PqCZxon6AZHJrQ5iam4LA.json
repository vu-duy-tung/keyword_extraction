    "text": "It's my local chippy, and I stopped by there after arriving on the last train back from St Andrews, the other night. It did the job, but it was far from good.  Overall, we said: \"the Clifton wins for proximity but not for quality. When chippy longing sets in, this is often the way. In future, I'll aim to point my deep-fried lust in the direction of L'Alba D'Oro or La Campagnola, both of which are excellent. My hunger was well and truly destroyed, but it was not a terribly satisfying experience. I look forward to more successful \"retoxing\" missions.\"",

    "text": "No no no no! Where do I start, perhaps slapping myself in the face for not having read the only other review on this place BEFORE crossing the threshold of the Clifton Fish Bar.   To cut a long story short, I ordered a pizza with salami, peppers, mushrooms and anchovies. Simple. 45 mins later I received a pizza with peppers and anchovies. On quizzing the (grumpy) guy behind the counter as to the invisible ingredients i had ordered and paid for, he told me they didn't have any mushrooms or salami left. \"Then why didn't you tell me this small, insignificant fact at the time i ordered, or subsequent 45 mins whilst I was in your shop?\"...no reply other than a look of get outa my shop. Appalling.   And how was the pizza you ask? Don't know, ask the rubbish bin not far from his shop.  If I could give 0 stars for this place, I would.",

    "text": "This is a very tough place to review, seeing as I have only been there once and that was a good while ago and I found that it was like any other standard chippy. The chips were not great, but didn't taste like cardboard, which is a bonus, and the smoked sausage was fine.  However, Clifton Fish Bar was last year fined for poor hygiene during a standard hygiene test. On hearing this news, I felt a bit sick that I had actually eaten there as the test had found dead mice and mice droppings in the shop. However, it must be noted that subsequent to this, the shop has cleaned its act up and although the owner says that he was not aware of any mouse problem, he has put in measures to make sure that such an issue will not arise in the future. It must be hard for a business to regain its reputation after such an issue, but the best thing that it does do is give you confidence that the place is now clean.",
