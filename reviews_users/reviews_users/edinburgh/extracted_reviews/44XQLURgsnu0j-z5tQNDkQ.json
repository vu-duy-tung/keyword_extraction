    "text": "On a Saturday evening we had been to many restaurants only to be turned away as they were fully booked and we had no reservation. Yamato were nice and managed to accommodate us for an hour, between 7:30pm to 8:30pm for when they needed the table back, so I was really grateful (particularly since we had been walking around foolishly reservation-less on a Saturday night, starving trying to find a place to eat!)  Yamato is one of the higher end, posh Japanese restaurants where everything is meticulously prepared to Instagram worthy perfection. Great presentation and taste, but as each portion is small and prices are high, expect a high food bill if not double the amount of a casual restaurant.   But for fine Japanese dining, I used to live in Japan and I can say that the food here was very authentic. It also made me happy to see a few dishes I thought I'd only see in Japan, such as Chawanmushi, Chilled Tofu, Miso Aubergine, Unagi don etc. so it was quite nostalgic!   The service was excellent and efficient, staff were polite despite it being busy. The atmosphere was more quiet in line with the fine dining experience, and there is Japanese style seating available as well as regular table seats. I would recommend a reservation, as I think we were just very lucky to be accommodated particularly around 6-8pm.   Overall, expensive but authentic Japanese fine dining in the heart of Edinburgh.",

My family and I had been loyal visitors to Suishya which has now closed down and also had been to Kanpai a few times - which is owned by the same people. The service was excellent and the decor was great too! The food was fantastic - I had the soba noodles, miso soup and the Wakame salad. I shared with the other members of my party the agadashi tofu and the miso aubergine. The other members of my party got the salmon panko roll which is a favourite of theirs from kanpai and some assorted nigiri. I highly recommend you visit!",
