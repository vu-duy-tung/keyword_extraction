    "text": "Another favorite for us! (I swear I don't LOVE everywhere I eat--just been having awesome luck lately!)  So I can't comment on the authenticity of the food, as I've never been to the Caribbean (unfortunately). But I can vouch for this stuff being absolutely delicious! And lots of it had plenty of spice, actually, which is so refreshing living around here in Scotland. Some of the bites off the starter platter had us sweating--always a good sign! Everything was so tasty.  And we're both absolutely stuffed. With enough leftovers for tomorrow's lunch. (How exciting!)  We've already planned what we're going to try next time we come to this place. Great food, awesome portions, lovely staff, tasty drinks... and by the way: fun music, too! Just an overall fantastic restaurant. Perfect date night.  Thanks, Trenchtown!",

    "text": "Decor-wise this place is good & the music chosen compliments the scene well, albeit very little of it was Caribbean.  Writing the winelist on mirrors may have seemed like a good idea at the time but the words obviously keep getting rubbed off as the wait staff handle them, leaving you in doubt as to the cost and varieties.  Our spicy, cheesy pancake starter was good and my girlfriends rib dish was enjoyed (& ultimately defeating) but unfortunately one of my chicken thighs was still pink and slightly bloody inside so I left the greater part of my main course.  The bar's rather sparsely stocked (and the plastic boxed bottle of Irn Bru looks daft) & the service ranged from pleasant to indifferent. An experience which could have been a lot better.",

    "text": "The flavour and quality of the food is fantastic.  I really recommend the Trinidad Doubles, Jerk Pork Belly.  The goat curry may have been the most tender I have ever had.  Just a shame they only take cash, as there have been times we would have bought more, hopefully they will fix this soon.",
