    "text": "Best Indian in England! We tried 3 other places in London and here and this is the best experience and food we have had thus far. The portions in Edinburgh are larger than London but some dishes you can get in Tapas (small) portions. I did this so I could try a few dishes. If you are traveling from the United States, these will probably seen very small, but if your from London they will be normal portions.   My food was True to Indian and Pakistan spice. The other restaurants I'd ask for medium and I would receive a very bland mild. Here, all the flavors and both the medium spiced and hot dish I tried were spot on and flavorful. Also everything I ordered was gluten free and it is clearly labeled, as are vegetarian, vegan, and different spice level options.  I ordered the Fish Masala. I knew it'd be different than a traditional masala from my previous experiences in the UK. Though this version still isnt as creamy as US masala, it wasnt sweet. I know that's odd but all the masala I was trying in the UK was very sweet. The best description is it's almost like an Indian spiced tomato sauce with fish. Very good.   The next I ordered was the Fish Karahi. This was my favorite. Very flavorful. The green chilis give it its color and add to the overall enhancement of the spices.  My wheat eating boyfriend had the Naan, the oreo and strawberry milkshake, and the strawberry dream. These all have gluten. But they looked pretty to me. He loved it as it's the first time in Ediburgh hes found these. Also he likes anything thats very sweet. I found another place we will try tomorrow but as for now, it make the celiac and the wheat eater happy. We are only here another 5 days but we might have to stop in again.",

    "text": "Oh man, Roti is good stuff. I stopped in at around 830 on a Sunday night for dinner because I was craving Indian food. They serve tapas style, but you can order fuller sized entrees if you're really hungry. I got the guava juice, garlic naan, butter chicken, and aloo tikki. All were amazing!  The aloo tikki (fried potato cakes with spices) came out first and I chose to get mint sauce; they also came with a small serving of greens. They were nice and spicy and tasted great on a cold fall night. They were also deceivingly filling for the portion size.  The butter chicken and garlic naan came out next and I loved both. The butter chicken was so creamy and had that great sweet flavor of makhani sauce. I got the garlic naan specifically to dip into the extra sauce (and also because I love garlic naan). The tapas portion of the chicken had about five or six pieces, which was a good size for me. All three of the plates filled me up!  The food was fantastic, the decor is modern, and the staff was friendly and efficient. I had a great dinner at Roti!",

    "text": "Edinburgh has lots of Indian restaurants, and I sampled a number of them. Roti was a mixed bag. The atmosphere is comfortable, service is nice enough, and prices are reasonable, but there were a couple of fails that keep it from getting another star. I ordered a non-vegetarian thali platter, and it came out reasonably promptly, but they dropped it off with no explanation whatsoever of what I was eating. One dish seemed like chicken, another lamb, but not a word about how anything was prepared. It was flavorful and seemed generally well-prepared, but from a service point of view, that's just strange. The other big failing is that they don't give you water--you have to buy it. As far as I know, that wouldn't even be legal here in the US. That alone is enough to keep me from coming here again, even if the food (whatever it was) is pretty good. There are too many other good Indian restaurants in town.",

They were also fried crispy and not very soft at all.   We got the chickpea chaat which was very tasty and the price decent. The spice was perfect.   We also got the chicken pakora which was really tasty but also fried very crispy.   Overall, good service and pretty good food.",

    "text": "Did a bit of searching for Indian food during our vacation and chose Roti based on some past reviews and its location in Old Town.  Staff was very friendly and we ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, rice, and naan to eat.  Place is also BYOB with no corkage fee but we didn't do that.  It's a small unassuming place but the food was really good and despite it appearing like they didn't give us alot, we were very full by the end.   Unlike in the U.S. though where you can get this combination all together, it was more ala-carte here so it seemed a little pricey compared to the states but it was very good in the end.   Great place for a couple or some friends to go get some Indian food and just relax after a day of site-seeing.",
