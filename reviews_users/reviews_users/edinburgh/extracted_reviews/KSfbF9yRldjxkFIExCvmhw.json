    "text": "Only came here once on a short trip to Edinburgh, so here are my two cents:  Pros -Cheap (5-6 for doner kebab), hole-in-the-wall kebab place in an otherwise posh area. Location was an easy walk from Edinburgh Castle -Awesome late hours, perfect for exhausted travelers (or late night party people) -The guy behind the counter was very nice to our group of 4  Cons -Small shop only has enough seating for around 6 diners total -Food is passable, but I've definitely had better. I agree with a previous reviewer that the meat is rather dry. This place is really best for its location.  Tip: Don't get the doner kebab in a wrap like I did - it comes wrapped in aluminium with way less veggies. Others got the doner kebab pita and it came on a plate with a much more generous salad on the side.",

    "text": "The proprietor is a very friendly Turkish guy.  We had an extended conversation while my chicken kabobs were over-cooking on the grill.  That was probably MY fault.  Nice flavors off the grill, but the chicken was really over-done.  I ate it anyway.  If he had not over cooked the chicken, I would have easily awarded a 4th star.  Only 6.  Really great place if you are in need of filling your stomach on a budget.",

    "text": "Decent late-night food is something that can be hard to find, Pasha delivers just this. They sell fried chicken, kebabs and burgers, mostly I go for the fried chicken as it is to coin a phrase finger lickin' good.  The staff are a friendly bunch too and happy to make you up something fresh, though there can be a wait on the chicken if something has run low. The shop is small so often if you do need to wait, you may be better sitting down or stepping outside so other hungry persons can get to the counter. All in all I have no problem recommending Pasha, it is a decent choice for night time eats.",

    "text": "OK, no way that I can't give these guys five stars!  I've been a couple of times, and their late night guilt free chicken wrap is as good as any other if not better... at request they've added jalepenos to mine from the pizza toppings and anyone who knows me would know that's worth a star on it's own. I mean, it was GOOD as far as chicken wraps go in general, not just 2am good. (It was 2am delicious!) ;-)  Where these guys earn five stars is a few weeks ago I called two minutes before closing really just to see if they actually closed at the stated time... sadly they confirmed they were to close in two minutes, so I thanked them and said goodbye... before I could hang up they asked if I wanted to put an order in so that they could hold it for me... I thought it too much trouble given we were at least 10 minutes away, but they eventually persuaded me so an order was placed for a friend and I... 10 or so minutes later we showed up and almost didn't see the place... it was lights off, floor swept, closed, but yet they welcomed us and handed over warm delicious wraps as if it were nothing. (I confess to having assumed they were busy and therefore over accommodating us, but that definitely wasn't the case.)  I've been a few times since and they are always friendly and accommodating, can't ask for more really.   In the end this is a Mediterranean take away joint, but for the foreseeable future they've captured my business when a night calls for one!  PS. For what they are and the service they offer they earn five stars, but if this type of place isn't your thing then that's not likely to change... for the rest of us late night wanderers give them a try! :)",

    "text": "I know I have friends all over, but I didn't realise that I had a friend in Pasha until I stepped through the door. The prompt greeting from the fellow behind the counter was welcoming, verging on friendly.   Seemingly to ensure absolutely -no- confusion on the point of whether or not we were buddies, he referred to me no fewer than half a dozen times as 'my friend' during the ten minutes I spent in the shop. Not bad for never having exchanged names, right?  After a brief perusal of the menu board, I opted for a basic donner kebab. Reportedly, they also serve up everything from burgers and chips to pizza to curries. Quite versatile, considering the wee footprint of this takeaway. With my meaty bounty (which barely fit in the styrofoam container!) in tow, I returned to my hotel room to stuff my face before passing out, as one does after four drams of whisky in one night.   Though I can't rave much about the meat (it ran a bit on the dry side), Pasha certainly isn't stingy with portions. Even though my last meal was nearly twelve hours prior, I was still only able to get down about half my kebab before raising my white flag in surrender. The combination of freshly toasted pita topped with shaved lamb (presumably) and topped off with salad, a lone wedge of tomato, and a heavy dousing of white sauce left me feeling satisfied and sleepy.  And as if you had to ask what I did with the other half of my kebab... it vanished once the sun came up and tasted even better than the night before. Waste not, want not!",

    "text": "This place varies depending on what you order it seems, eaten here a couple of times with mixed results. I ordered a hummous falafel pitta and some chips for my friend. Once we were up the road a bit I realise had no falafel or humous for roughly 3.50 I got a value pitta bread and wilted salad. The chips were weird and followed the pitta into the bin. Previous to this I ordered chicken wings and my friend a pizza. The pizza was passable and the chicken wings quite nice. Two experinces one awful one middle of the road I guess. The staff are great though and very friendly which is what bumped this review up by one star. I would say avoid for anything other than kebabs which I am told are excellent. I dont eat kebabage so no idea on that front.",

    "text": "Read Jenny L's review before trip to Edinburgh; since Pasha is a short walk from where I'm bunking I ate a donner pita sandwich plate special with a big pile of meat, salad veggies & sauce, chips, and drink. Sandwich was sloppy, overflowing the pita and quite tasty. Turkish guys running it are really friendly, the food was quick, made-to-order, and reasonably priced so it's worth a visit.",
