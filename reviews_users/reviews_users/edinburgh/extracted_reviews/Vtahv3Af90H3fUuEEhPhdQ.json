    "text": "I honestly thought I'd be giving Wagamama five stars...exciting, innovative, fantastic food, everywhere else had one except Edinburgh and I'd never been before! However, after my first visit, I'm afraid I was left in a three star quandry!  We went there on a tuesday night, and there was a 10 people deep queue at the door. Now this may have been due to the fact there was a gig on at the Picture House just up the road, but I've been reliably informed there is ALWAYS a queue at the front door! When we finally got to the front, we requested a booth, rather than seats at the long tables, but were told this wasn't possible...how annoyed were we when the folk behind us were given one?!  Once we were seated, there was a flurry of activity, our orders were taken, and dishes served before we had time to have a gulp of wine. Some elements of my Yasai katsu curry were extremely tasty, in particular the sweet potato, aubergine and butternut squash deep-fried in panko breadcrumbs. However, there was a huge pile of rice on the side covered in a curry sauce that tasted exactly like the stuff you get over chips down the local chippy! I was more than disappointed!  For dessert, we shared a chocolate sponge with chocolate and wasabi sauce. It was okay...but not 'Wow, I'd happily sell my soul for another slice' okay, and before we had time to wipe our mouths with our lovely, lemony wipes, our plates were cleared and the bill was on the table.  This is definitely not the place for a long, relaxed dinner and, given they don't take bookings for large groups (as we found out the following week!), it's not good for a girlie/blokey/work night out either!  I understand the philosophy behind Wagamama, but for me it was mediocre food served at record speed, so they could get us out the door and get more folk from the queue in. I'll go back and give the food another go sometime, but I'm not in any great rush!",

Over the last 3 years I've been emailing them to find out why they weren't here. (sad I know)  So, as soon as this place opened I made it my mission to get there quickly.  First visit was in December for my birthday with a group of friends and the 2nd visit in January with my husband.  Both times, a reasonable wait (30 mins for a group booking and 15 mins for 2 people) and every time I walk past there are people waiting.  So lesson here, be prepared to wait  There does seem to be an option to book for groups but it was not available when I went in December.  The concept is good, that your food is ordered and served as soon as it's ready.  The menu hasn't changed all that much in the year but it's good Japanese fusion hot food.  The only problem I ever have is what dish to try they are all so lovely.  Wagamama is a chain but in my opinion is the best of the bunch and what every chain should aspire too, quick, fresh cooked, yummy food.",

I went here with BF and managed to shame him with the sheer amount of food I felt it necessary to consume (hey, I'd just been paid and was ridiculously excited about finally trying this new branch!) The food was, of course, amazing. I had several starters (that's a polite way of saying 4, right?) followed by the Wagamama Ramen, my firm favourite from my student days, when Wagamamas was the height of sophistication.   We were seated fairly sharpish for a weekday night, even though the place was packed to the rafters. The service was ...ok... A bit below what I'm used to in the other branches. A pity.  All in all, I love the place though!",

I have walked by this place for 3 years now and I finally decided to stop on in. I have to admit the name Wagamama kind of turned me off the place had no idea it was a noodle chain. The place is quite big and was nice and quiet when I stopped in for lunch. The waitress was a pleasant gal who was quick with our order and helped us pick our dish. I do like the fact that they have a juice bar option and with a big variety it was hard to pick. Our food came fairly quick and my eyes grew as big as saucer plates when I saw the bowl. The amount was massive! Quite good tasting as well as I ate and slurped by way through the entire bowl. I will be going back here more often as its the perfect place for a nice relatively healthy lunch and I do recommend it. Only thing I didn't care for was the price as it seems to me to be a bit expensive , but that could be because I am a penny pincher. Other then that eat here folks!",

    "text": "Came to Wagamama this evening for a nice dinner, and I ended up ordering the number 30 pork ramen along with the 101 vegetable gyoza. First thing I noticed that I found a little odd was the fact the pork ramen was being served with...chicken broth? Typically a pork ramen is served with a tonkatsu pork broth, so why the chicken? Anyway, next. First item that arrived at the table was my gyoza and I must say, they were terrible. They were luke warm and so soggy and mushy, and the dipping sauce that they came with tasted like ketchup with parsley in it. Next came my ramen, and it was definitely lacking in flavor. The actual pork itself was great, but as far as the broth and the other items that were mixed in...like I said, it was all just lacking. At the end of it all, it took FOREVER for the waitress to come back and take our payment for the bill. If I was even able to come back here again (not from this country!), I would not.",

You won't catch us breaking our necks or queuing for an hour for a table, though.

My expectations were quite high but when we got there we had to queue for a really long time and the atmosphere felt rushed. Eventually we got our table and ordered drinks but despite them writig on your menue I got the wrong beverage. We ordered food and it took quite a while for all of the plates to arrive, some people had almost finished when we got the last dishes. The food was ok, my ramen noodle soup was rather tasteless, the stock definetly needed more flavouring and I had to put loads of sauce in to make it taste of anything. It was not horrible but I was definetly expecting better. I have declined any offer of going back since.",

I had the wagamama ramen and it was a disaster - you know something is wrong when you see chicken breast in soup with seafood. As someone who loves ramen (we frequent ramen restaurants back home in Singapore), this was rather tasteless. The hallmark of any good bowl of ramen is the soup and this bowl of soup/broth was very \"healthy\". I suppose wagamama caters to local taste, but if I could describe wagamama ramen in one word, it would be tasteless. Notwithstanding, I only tried ramen (and the gyoza, which was average) so it would be unfair to label wagamama as a bad quick-service restaurant. Service-wise, it was good, quick and efficient.",

    "text": "I've been super excited to finally get a Wagamama in Edinburgh and I was not disappointed! The restaurant is clean and modern with bold flashes of colour on the walls that give a cosier atmosphere than other Wagamamas I've been to. My husband and I went around 2pm on a Wednesday afternoon. There was a good atmosphere and healthy amount of people. The tables are big and long so sit about 12, which can be a little restricting if its full. But I'm friendly and never find it uncomfortable. They try to spread people out as much as possible, we had half a table to ourselves! There are also comfy booths for 4 with a great window view out onto Lothian Road, perfect for people watching. Maybe best to avoid if your a noodle slurper like me though!   Anyway, enough about my eating habits and on to the food! Ah, the beautiful food. I opted for one of my favourites, chicken raisukaree. A great blend of lime and coconut curry with stir fried chicken, mange tout, peppers and onion with steamed rice. This is a seriously satisfying dish. Fresh zingy lime, rich coconut cream and hot chillies all work together to create a perfectly balanced dish. They also serve it with prawns if you prefer which is equally delicious. Aidan went for one of their specials, which change weekly. He had an amazing noodle dish which had a lime and lemongrass base with stir fried chicken and beansprouts, topped off with chopped peanuts. I could not help but steal several large fork fulls of this! The peanuts give it an extra dimension without being as heavy as a satay or a pad Thai. The lime really lifted it and made it taste really fresh and moreish. Its a shame its not a regular, I think I could eat it every time I visited. We also had a side dish of edamame, fresh soya beans cooked in their pods and tossed in chili and garlic salt before serving. Just spicy enough to get your taste buds going! All the main dishes are under 10, our edamame were around 4 and are perfect for sharing so I think its very reasonably priced.  Get yourself to Wagamama, its awesome!",

The only reason this gets 2 stars is because of the starters (lollipop prawns and calamari).  These were very overpriced for what they were but tasty and edible unlike the main course.  We both had noodle dishes one was a ramen and I can't remember what the other one was other than disgusting.  Both looked like a whole coriander plant had fallen in by accident.  I could still taste lumps of the stock cube used in mine.  His smelled like used football socks had been added to make the stock.  Upon complaining to the waitress (who we again had to search for) we were told we could have one starter on the house.  The damage at the end came to nearly 50 even with this free starter.  Do yourself a favour and go somewhere else, anywhere else!  There are plenty of reasonably priced decent places in Edinburgh don't waste your time here.",

Depending on your tastes and your fidelity to the notion of Japanese cuisine, you might not dig this. My daughter had the Wagamama ramen noodles which came with chicken, fish, and various other things in it. She said it was lovely and not sweet. I had the teriyaki salmon soba which was nice but started to veer into too sweet for me. Maybe it's been too long since I had teriyaki but if it's normally that sweet, I can't really enjoy it. The only party who was very let down by the meal was my 5 year old who ordered mini yasai yaki soba. This was like a pudding, it was so sweet. So not for her. She ate the veg and tofu off the top and pushed it aside to beg for noodles off her sister. My hub had the saien soba and pronounced it a bit bland. He had his to take-away as he was home with a cold and could not doctor it with the chili oil or flakes they have at the table. So overall, it was fine. Service was nice and attentive. I'm just not sure about the fusion concept. I think I miss my old stomping grounds in JapanTown in San Francisco where udon noodles come in huge bowls the size of your head and there is very little sweetness involved in proceedings.",

I was brought a menu with a list of 30 possible allergens and I could see what was in all the different dishes!

I have had pretty much the same dishes at a fraction of the cost in other Japanese style restaurants. Its like 6 starter, 9-12 for a main & the pricey drinks... doesn't sound like too much but considering this is a chain & you can go to much better independent restaurants for about the same price, seems a bit like a rip off? But anyway, this isn't this branches fault about the prices.... the staff at this one seem great, and there seems to be enough on which makes a change from other places! The place is pretty big but service is very quick/efficient. Toilets are squeaky clean. Most times i've been i've managed to escape the huge waiting list (last time I left it was an hr, ouch!). One thing about wagamama that I think would put a lot of people off is the seating arrangements, where you pretty much end up eating sitting ontop of a stranger as you are so close together... I know its \"positive eating\" and all that but I don't really wanna share my table with someone I don't know! My best advice is go early/quiet times!",

I made special trip to get dinner there, and well, it didn't go so well, did it? First wifi wasn't working very well. Thus no check in at this location. Second, the Wagamama ramen wasn't that great. Supposed to be miso broth but I didn't taste much miso. Third, ramen is all about the broth and noodles. Noodle wasn't that great either.  Maybe I should have tried something else, it looked like they are busy all the time, but they were not as good as the one in London...",

We both had ramen and both were unable to hold anything in for the next 36 hours.  We missed the entire Hogmanay celebration as we were unable to leave the bathroom.  I would like to thank the management for ensuring everything gets washed before preparing, refrigerated when received and cooked thouroughly when ordered.  Luckily hospitalization was not required so treat this review as your precursor to a lawsuit should anyone ever get sicker based on your inattention to proper food handling.",

I cannot truly fault the service. Friendly, adapt and efficient.  The restaurant is clean and tidy. I have an growing issue with the presentation and taste of the food on offer. I kept myself from reviewing as I was hoping that some of my experiences were a fluke and all was going to get better. It didn't.  The portions are on the small side, and seemingly have gotten smaller. The menu was once very extensive, then they took of many dishes and it became limited and then they (re-)introduced the former failing dishes with some 'twists'.   The taste of many dishes is a wide variety of bland. As with many mass Asian outlets, it feel like they cater towards the non spicy eaters as to not to offend anyone. Does that mean that every time I order I have to ask for chili, add pepper and soya and chili oil to my dish? Apparently so, as when I asked if the chef could add some spice and heat to the dish on ordering I was reminded that these additions are on the table for my own flavour and spice level creation...one can have feast.  Sorry Wagamama, you are off my top list and are now in the Meh listings in my book.",

We went as an after work quick meal most recently and the waitress sat us next to the chefs who were on a break and chatting really loudly which was a bit annoying. I kind of feel that it would be better considering the place was half empty to either seat customers away from staff throwing crap at each other and swearing or have a staff room. We were also put at a tiny table for two which we moved from to a larger space as there were at least 50 spares.  The Ramen I always ordered has now changed :-( but I enjoyed the food we ordered but sometimes feel the veg in the stirfrys could be more as you feel a bit meat and noodled out at the end these days. Now dont get me wrong I can live on meat and noodles but I do love some token veg in there too.  Overall a good fast food option though.",

A-MA-ZING!!!!  the new ramen broth of chicken, miso, and ginger is so delicious and such a huge improvement on the basic chicken and pork stock that was used previously; mix that with some crispy pork and korean bbq sauce and you now have my new favourite noodle based soup dish!!!  if the portions weren't so huge, i think i might have even been tempted to have seconds the meal was that delicious!  the new menu excited me so much that i even forced my boyfriend to share a dessert with me, and you have mini cake size options that come with a hot drink!!  really, so cute and the chocolate fudge cake topped with a wasabi cream is so darn good!! and in tiny little squares it takes away all the guilt of eating dessert, because mini cakes means mini calories!!  wagamama, you've upped your game and you now get my hearty five star approval!!  seriously, for a chain restaurant i am so super impressed i actually cannot wait to go back!!!",

So, definitely felt the elation of a Wagamamas opening up in Edinburgh. If you have read my reviews before, you know that means it will take several months or years before I get round to visiting. I think I did pretty well this time, 6-7 months since it opened? In part to avoid the throng of people flocking. It's a busy enough place at the best of times.   And this location is no exception to this rule, and I introduced the SR to the Wagamama way. He was not sorry. We shared a vegetarian pad thai, grilled prawns and followed it up by apple and cinnamon gyoza. I'm not buying gyoza deep fried as a dessert. The dough doesn't like it, I tell ya. And what can I say, Wagamama's doesn't blow you away, but I've never been disappointed in the food. I still heart Wagamama, it's just good food.",

What else is there to say except the food is great, reasonably priced and arrives when it's fresh and ready to go. I always have a great meal here - there's been no duffers so far at all.   The set up is a bit weird if you've never been before. You just sit wherever's available, so that could be next to strangers if you're on a long bench. Booths are better as you get your own space, but there's something fun and different about the communal feel of the place.   Staff scribble your orders on the table mat, and the food arrives when it's ready. So everyone can get served at a different time. It just means you get your food when it's uber fresh and hasn't been sitting on the pass for five minutes!   It's all very brisk and fast-paced in here, but that just adds to the atmosphere. The only downside is that there is often a loooong queue to get a table, so you can sometimes be waiting ten or fifteen minutes to get a space.   It's worth it, though!",

Since it was a chilly day and I was craving soup, figured it was the perfect opportunity to get ramen.  Big open space and great vibes when you walk in.  We ordered chicken kara age, pork belly ramen and pad Thai salad. By chance the chef made an extra chicken katsu curry and they gifted it to us!  I really wanted to love this meal but the food looked better than it tasted.  The best dish turned out to be the katsu curry!  It was crunchy and flavorful.  Otherwise, the pork belly was over cooked, salad was bland, etc. We left very full but probably won't be back.",

The restaurant is bustling with customers and the food looks gorgeous when it comes out, but the food is mediocre at best and tastes like someone is *trying* to mimic Asian flavors without succeeding. The raisukaree I ordered was watery and plain and the shrimp and vegetables should've been cooked longer in the curry allowing for more flavor to harmonize with it. Additionally, the tako yama I ordered which is basically takoyaki just tasted like luke warm squid balls.",

For my main meal I ordered two appetizers, the tori kara age (seasoned crispy chicken pieces) and ebi katsu (crispy breaded shrimp). The shrimp was great, but the chicken waa just average.

    "text": "I have heard rave reviews of the efficiency of the service and dining experience Wagamama has to offer, but I feel my experience fell very short of expectation. We went on a Friday night,  it was busy, but we saw plenty of empty seats and there was no one waiting in front of us, so we expected to be sat very quickly. No one came to greet us initially and a few minutes later, a girl walked over to hand us menus without saying anything. We waited a few more minutes as the queue behind us formed and still no one told us they would seat us shortly. There was a table we saw when we walked in that was half-empty and eventually after nearly 10 minutes we were seated there.I noticed we take reservations, which having worked in customer service, it seems like they weren't quite sure how to manage that along with walk-ins as they weren't paying a lot of attention to the people queueing outside.  The person who sat us awkwardly explained the menu to us, essentially just reading off the heading of each section, which was a nice gesture, but didn't feel helpful. Our server came over who was very lovely, and I think one of the two nice things about our visit. We each ordered sake for one and each a ramen dish, the duck and the vegetarian one. They write your order on your place mat so they know who has what. When the food arrived, despite the numbers being written on our place mats, the two dishes were mixed up, which I thought was funny considering they write it on there for a reason.   The veggie ramen was good-sized and tasted okay, the mushrooms and the tofu were very tasty, but the broth and noodles were nothing special. My partner didn't rave about the duck, he expected something a bit different and it seems the duck comes from a can, although he said, overall the dish still tasted nice.  The sake was very sweet and not really to my liking, but was OK. Our server was prompt and friendly, bringing the bill over quickly. But overall, the initial service from others working there and the cost of our meal was below expectation. In total it was 28 and we felt for the fast-food style is seems to be it wasn't a value experience. I wouldn't go back, as I feel you can get better food and prices elsewhere.",

To save problems I just took what they gave me and boy did I pay the price. Was just to spicy for my palette and ended up giving me the shits the next day. Anyway the side orders were nice, the ribs need a better  sauce as they just taste like rib. I know that sounds mad but the enjoyment when eating ribs for me is the flavour of the sauce. I recommend you double check what your ordering and stay away from spicy chicken unless you like flames tearing out your arse the day after.",
