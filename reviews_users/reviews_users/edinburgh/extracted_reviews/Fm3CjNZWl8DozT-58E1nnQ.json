We ordered the Red Kite Breakfast with an extra egg and the tomato left fresh. I don't usually eat bread but the sourdough looked and smelled so appetising that I couldn't resist.   I would definitely recommend Red Kite to anyone looking for satisfying breakfast before hitting the sites.",

Community tables available, warm friendly staff.  A favorite place for locals and the lucky tourists who stumble in after a long night in Edinburgh.  Krista had the Avacado Toast, spinach salad... she loved it. Tables were clean so was the floors...And So Was the Toilet! I rarely give 5 stars... but this place is wonderful.",

I had the big breakfast sampler and it was amazing. The eggs were a perfect sunny side up. The sausage and bacon complimented each other in taste. The ciabatta bread was crunchy and went well with all the meats. Top it off with a latte and it feels like mom cooked you a home cooked meal back at home feel to it. I would definitely come back here.",

Something I always love to see is that they support local artists by putting their art on their walls with a pricetag. There is lots of open space, so parents don't need to worry about prams being blocked. You can sit in the windowsill, at a normal table or on a lovely sofa.  Another way you can see the social conscience of Red kite is by looking at their menu. Free range eggs and sausages and good local produce.  The brunch menu looked particularly appetising, with classic breakfast options as well as pumpkin & sage fritters and shaksuka (always wanted to try this)! A breakfast item will set you back around 7. I opted for a soy flat white and it was pretty good, no complaints! Next time I'll be back for some grub!",
