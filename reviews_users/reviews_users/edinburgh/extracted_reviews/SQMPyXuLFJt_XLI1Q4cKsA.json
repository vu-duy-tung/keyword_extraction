    "text": "Arrived here on a quiet and rainy Sunday night, and it is safe to say that it was the right choice dining here.  As it was getting late into the evening, most places were getting ready to close but this place invited me in after asking if they were still serving food, and James, who took care of me was nothing short of amazing. He was simply very professional and friendly even though I was the only person there at the end of the night.  While I overestimated myself on my order and struggling to finish my plates, I saw on my phone that I was already there beyond closing time. Although I was feeling guilty and asked James if I can quickly close out my tab, he simply told me to take my time and unfazed, just worked on his bookkeeping and kept a pleasant conversation with me.  Been lived in Tokyo and San Francisco for 3 decades, James and this restaurant redefined \"World Class\" for my dining experience. Definitely throws you off with their storefront ad mentioning \"Casual Dining\", at least from an American point of view!  P.S. The food is also great to say the least, but the experience made it even so much better!",

This is apparently a new area in the city, nearby the shores, with lots of exciting restaurants nearby. But we want something simple tonight. We came here by chance because we don't feel like seafood restaurant again. Finding the Giulianos, that looked as a real family style italian restaurant, seemed the perfect choice. Seeing the menu outside, they have excellent options at very good prices. So we went.   The service, the ambience and the food are very italian and we like it a lot. I particularly like that they offer half portion of pasta. Suits me a lot, but also allows one to try options. One good score!   We dine with a honest bottle of house red wine, a start (king prawns with arucula salad) to share, a full penne and italian chorizo pasta, half seafood filled pasta and a tiramisu all for 39. And all were very, very good!  At the end,,we have another great dinner experience in this amazing country and a lovely evening, with a nice feeling of home cooking and welcoming what is good after 10 days away from home. What one can want more than that?",

    "text": "I have visited this restaurant many times over the years and I have never been disappointed. There is an extensive menu and the food is excellent. There is also a special lunch menu available Mon - Fri of 2 courses for 7.95. There is live music on Mon and Tues which can be a bit annoying so if you don't like too much noise when you are eating ask for a table further away. I have to say the musician is very good. It is a very family orientated restaurant and the kids are encouraged to create their own pizza but don't let the thought of children stop you from going as this is more of a weekend thing. Great place to celebrate your birthday. Staff are great and there is plenty parking in the area and great place to have a stroll after your meal.",
