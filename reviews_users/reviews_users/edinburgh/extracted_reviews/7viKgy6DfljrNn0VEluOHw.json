    "text": "Lovely resto for special occasions or something a little but different from the ordinary.  We started the evening with a pre dinner drink in the basement speakeasy bar. The Stewart's Hollyrood Pale Ale on draft was light & refreshing and the Earl Gray Collins had a lovely kick to it. The bar seemed a bit stark & was a bit on the chilly side. More pictures & heat would add to the ambience/atmosphere.  Upstairs in the restaurant the staff were attentive despite being busy. Each course was explained in detail. We went for the 7 course tasting menu with paired drinks.  The stand out dishes of the night were the wild boar terrine & the hake which melted in the mouth. The nettle soup had an interesting flavour. The lamb dish was good but not quite as tender as it could have been.  The desserts were good but not particularly innovative compared to the savoury courses.  The wines/drinks pairing was well executed. The blended wines worked well with each course and the cocktail was a nice addition.  I'd definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking something a little different for a special occasion.",

    "text": "Edinburgh is slowly becoming a True gastronomic gem with a huge number an variety of top class restaurants and bars opening alongside classic favourites. It really warms my foodie heart :) my latest restaurant was to Seasons after reading a review of it on a favourite blog. I made the booking and soon we were off for a evening full of simple but tasty culinary delights.  The whole menu of ingredients is becoming quite the thing in Edinburgh. I love the idea and I've seen it work really well but also completely fail.  So with fingers cross I hope that Seasons would be the first not the latter.  Thankfully I was right with a 7 course tasting menu that was delivered to high skill with really quality ingredients. To summarise the evening we had:  -celeriac volute with leeks -smoked salmon with pickled cucumbers, cloudberry sorbet, crisp bread, and dill -wild boar terrine with apple sauce, wild garlic, blue carrot, and baby parsnip  -wild nettle soup with croutons and sweet viola  -hake with scandi seasoned lentils, cauliflower puree, crispy seaweed and Spring beauty  -venison with asparagus, purple potato croquette, wild mushroom, and red wine jus  -rose apple pastry with vanilla ice cream, crumble, apple jelly, as cinnamon And all that with a quince sidecar cocktail, chestnut bourbon cocktail and two glasses of red wine. It was classic ingredients done exceptionally well in really tasty and slightly different ways. I enjoyed every course but the stand out for me was the nettle soup and the venison.   With the food being the real star the restaurant was done out in neutral shades with pine walls and clean lines.  It's not a massive place with two smaller dining rooms but I felt it really worked for good ambience and experience. I felt the only let down was the service. When we arrived the restaurant was fairly quiet and service was spot on.  When it started to get busy a while later the service did slip a bit which was a shame but I think something easily fixed.  However the service we did receive was friendly, helpful, and polite.   The 5 and 7 course menus are reasonably priced for what is served. However it's probably not a place you'd just go on a whim, more of a special date night or celebration restaurant. That said though, I'll definitely find another excuse to go back soon and see what the next list of ingredients brings!",

    "text": "Wow, what an awesome experience! This hidden gem ended up being on of my favorite restaurants from my latest trip to the U.K.  Unlike other restaurants that offer a set menu, you are given a list of seasonal items and if there is anything you don't like, you simply cross it off and the rest is up to the chef! We decided on the five course menu with drinks chosen for us as well, and it was an eating experience unlike anything I've ever tried. Unless you know you really dislike something I recommend keeping it on the list (for me, I know I don't like salmon, but I decided to keep the hake on the menu-which I ended up really loving). Each plate is artfully presented, and while the portions look small, you definitely walk away feeling full and satisfied! At the end of the meal, the owner and head chef even came out to talk with us about our dishes and spoke about his passion for food, and how he really enjoys going on a culinary journey with each of his customers. The service cannot go unmentioned either, our waiter Matt was so attentive, and helpful and checked in after every course to see what we thought, he was exceptional and his food and drink knowledge was amazing.  The restaurant is small-it only seats 24, so be sure to make reservations ahead of time. The best thing about this restaurant is it opens your eyes to foods you would normally never try. If you're in Edinburgh, take a break from the amazing pies and haggis, and try this place!!",

    "text": "What an experience! We were recommended to Seasons from our Concierge (at the Apex Waterloo Hotel). We were absolutely amazed. The food was spectacular, scrumptious and exciting. We didn't know what to expect because you're given a list of ingredients and asked if you dislike any or have any allergies. We only had one issue. We chose the drink pairings and the 5 course, which turned out to be 6 course if you count the apple sorbet palette cleanser. Service was outstanding. Location great. I seriously can't say enough good things. Price was reasonable given the quality. Roughly 55pounds/person. So worth it!",

I tried the five course tasting with the drink pairing and eagerly awaited each course - none of which disappointed. The presentation was spectacular and taste was even better. I left every ingredient on the menu and allowed the chef work her magic. The chef perfectly delivered and I tried things on this day that I didn't even know existed. A great idea which is further inspired by a chef with a great outlook on life. I wish this restaurant all the luck and wish everyone felt the way this chef felt about food.",
