    "text": "Currently the top of my list, specialist  in Szechuan cuisine and seafood, but actually offers North and Northwest cuisine plus hot pot, not something you can find in any Chinese place. When come in ask for the Chinese menu (with English of course) that's where they hide the good stuff. Everything is freshly prepared, come in large portion. Service is friendly but can be slow during rush hour. I went to this place way too often but still can't get enough.  P.S. They only accept cash at the moment :(",
