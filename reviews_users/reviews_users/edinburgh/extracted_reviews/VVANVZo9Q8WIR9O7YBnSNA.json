One thing in particular that I like is that they post their soups daily on Facebook so you can decide before you go, and they always have something different, from Smoked Turkey and yellow split pea to Sweet potato beetroot and feta.  There were always queues out the door at lunch time so they opened up another place 5 mins just down the road.  I haven't been for a while so I'm definitely due another visit :)",

    "text": "This was the first of two shockingly horrible dining experiences of the day. To say we were disappointed would be an understatement, but I guess that's our own fault. We wanted to grab a quick bite for breakfast before heading to Waverly to catch our train to Belhaven. Having just downed two highly caffeinated beverages in the space of 40 minutes, I didn't feel like roaming around town trying to find something, so when we passed by The Square, it seemed perfect.  No. To start, the eat-in space is tiny, and none of the four people working there took the time to communicate with the customers. We entered the establishment at the same time as another couple, and we both kind of stood around for a second wondering what to do, until we all just decided to pick a table (there are only four, and they're squeezed super close together; I literally had to move the table we were trying to sit at in order to get in, to avoid disturbing the couple that was already seated).  We glanced at the menus on the table, and my husband went to place our orders. I wanted the breakfast meal with the eggs, smoked Scottish salmon and toast. My husband got to the counter to order, only to find that they didn't have salmon, smoked, Scottish or not. Put on the spot, I settled with the bacon. My husband ordered the French Toast meal.  They were out of the juice that I wanted (also listed on the menu) and didn't have another option that wasn't bottled, so we made do with tap water.  It took forEVER for our food to come out. We sat there, waiting for something to happen while the owner wandered the front room, talking on the phone and inexplicably propping the front door open. It was a bitingly cold and windy morning, and there was nobody coming in to make a delivery, so why he decided to leave the door open still confuses me. The couple sitting closest to the door had to ask him to close it, and he looked amazed that they'd request such a thing.  While we sat there waiting (and waiting, and waiting), we got a show of the owner's conversation. Apparently, he'd just taken over the restaurant, and some of the paperwork he'd inherited was in disarray. He sat down at one of the tables to have a long and loud conversation with a service provider, going into great detail about accounts, promises, money owed and expectations. It was super unprofessional.  Once our food (FINALLY) made it out to our table, I almost laughed out loud. We'd dropped almost 12 on THAT?! It was something I could have made at home. No, it was a sad imitation of something I could have made at home. There was no presentation, creativity or flavor to anything that was slapped onto my plate.   And my husband's meal? My goodness, it was an insult. The claimed he'd get brioche bread, but what he really got was plain old white sliced bread. It wasn't garnished with cinnamon or powdered sugar, and the two slices just lay on the plate looking pathetic.  The truly frustrating part was that the food wasn't even hot. It was barely even warm. For as long as it took to be served, I was expecting it to be piping hot and steaming away.  Really disappointing meal - the first in two weeks of travel - and even more disappointing that we got stuck with this whole experience for our anniversary breakfast.  Pass.",

With only a few seats this could have been a cosy place to go to but the no heating knocked that one in the head, all the guests that where eating in, kept their jackets on.  A good menu on offer from steak sandwiches, daily specials, breakfast's to filled roll's.  The food would have been nice if it had been served on hot plates, as they where served on cold plates the food went cold quickly.  The floor looked as if it hadn't been swept in a day or two,   The coffee is nice not could not fault that.",

    "text": "What a mentally crazy place. If I hadn't been warned about the process at The Square, I would have just been confused ie. pick your bread from the side (oh how I think about grubby paws manhandling the bread...euw) and then order. I was a bit confused as there was a huge queue, which I joined like a good and proper Brit, only to watch someone else march straight up to the counter and order. I then realised this was some strange gathering of people who were either waiting for a table, to pay, or to get their order.   Thus enlightened, I walked up to the counter and placed my order. Looking in the deli counter I started to feel less confident, noticing that there was no separation of meat and non meat products, and the same equipment used for both.   I heard another guy complaining after his lunch was lost, and my confidence dorpped further. I then saw, from the side, my lunch (a vegetable melt) which I assume would have been treated like a panini, having the contents removed from the bread, thrown into the panini toaster, then shovelled back into the panini and toasted as one. Hmm.  Hungry and not super fastidious, I took it, but I wouldn't return, The Squares practices just seem a bit too shambolic for me.",

    "text": "We'd made up our minds to grab a bite in the National Portrait Gallery but decided to pop across the road to the Square for a change of scenery.  Have to say the jury's out on whether we chose wisely.   Inside is pretty standard 'sandwich shoppy' though there are some comfy seats to grab. We sat near the door - mistake number one, and ordered a steak baguette (not bad) and a chicken and sweet corn chowder - mistake number two.  For some reason folk coming in and out didn't quite grasp the concept of a front door that can close as well as open so it was a chilly dining experience.  Got up to close it once but hoped the staff might have done something after the double doors were left open for the fifth time. Not good.  I'd opted for the steak, but sweetness and light thought the chowder would be more up her street.  Golden rule for chefs - you can't take salt out, so better to under do it than over do it.  I could almost see her mineral levels rising in front of me and said goodbye to my can of San Pellagrino as she tried in vain to combat her saline intake.  That said, I thought the steak baguette was pretty decent but I don't think we'll be rushing back.",

    "text": "I wandered into town still half asleep before hopping onto a bus up to Aberdeen. My Belly was not happy at the thought of having to wait til reaching the granite city before getting something to eat, so a quick breakfast was what I was looking for. I had walked past this place a few times, it is close to the bus station so I headed straight for it.  I arrived and as it was early morning they were quite busy with takeaways and such like, but it wasn't too busy! I then decided I had enough time to sit and enjoy my breakfast roll rather than walk and eat (that always ends badly for me!!) I grabbed a seat and one of the girls came over to clear the cups and plates off the table. I had decided on what I wanted and sat there for a good ten minutes without anyone coming over to see what I was wanting. Although it does not suggest anywhere that you need to order at the counter, I was a bit peeved that none of the staff thought to come over, or for the girl that was clearing to inform me that it was not table service!? I therefore ended up getting my egg and tattie scone roll to takeaway as I had already wasted 10 minutes sitting in which time the queue and got vastly longer! Not happy. The roll, was well, an egg and tattie scone roll.   The soup board sounded tasty with lots of choices, but I think if I was going to go back for lunch, I would maybe try avoid the 'lunch rush' as I would feel the service may not be quite up to scratch.",

    "text": "THE SQUARE, EDINBURGH   There is no reason why lunch, although usually less time-abundant and void of the kind of ambience only a neatly presented dinner table and a rather nice bottle of red afford, should be treated with disregard and a hurried, soggy ham and egg roll and can of diet coke, gulped down over your laptop... Especially now, in light of renewed, fashionable health awareness, more of us tend to hunt out the trendy eatery, where the want for desirable food much outweighs the unfortunately hefty price tag. Not so with The Square on Edinburgh's South St Andrews Street, where a range of affordable and appealing lunchtime options have been embraced and the warm and welcoming staff of this take-away-cum-sit for a while, trendy food outlet have built up a regular clientele which is growing daily. Daily offerings, via a giant blackboard, include an array of fine cheeses, hams, fresh breads, pastas and a variety of accompaniments along with the ever-changing choice of 'made on the premises' soups, hot dishes and freshly ground coffees. All for taking away or sitting on the premises to eat, when you can leave feeling satisfied to have experienced a tasty, healthy, inexpensive and relaxing lunch worthy of your alloted funds for the day!",
