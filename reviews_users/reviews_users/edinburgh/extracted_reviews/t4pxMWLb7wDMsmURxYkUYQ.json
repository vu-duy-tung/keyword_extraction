They've got two outlets on the same street which strangely changes names every couple of feet:- so that's one on Nicolson street, walk southwards a minute or two and you'll come to the other on Clerk street. The staff are really friendly and never seem to change so it's easy to become a regular here. I've even been lucky enough to hear the troubled life story of a Palestinian member of staff, even if hunger did affect my capacity for sympathy. I LOVE their falafels, although I may have to coax them into adding a little more from time to time. However, do be a little more adventurous than I've been and try something else; having been there several times, it's proving difficult to sway me to try another dish, as great as they may look! From donner kebabs to pizzas, my friends have had the works, and I've only got smiling faces to report.. as for me, I'm loyally sticking to my falafel wrap!",

The 'wrap' moniker initially put me off, expecting a thin, unsatisfying kebab with little breaded armour of note. However, I soon realised that the khobz was a hearty bread worthy of the finest naan, from Michael's Thornton to Best Poulton (Kings of 'babs in their own right). The kebab also had the brilliant USP of being presented in a form that was both appealing to the eye, compact and easy to eat without the usual sloppy-shirtedness and dribbling palms/chin associated with the usual high street kebabbery. I would thoroughly recommend the Palmyra Kebab- indeed, my only niggles are with the 6.00 price (for a greedy large mixed, that is). Although Edinburgh, being a capital city, is perhaps doomed to incur such weighty wallet-outgoings. Me and my compadre tucked in like two little hobbits with heavily lamb-and-garlicked lembas. Beautiful. Ignoring from my insane verbosity, I really do recommend this cracking lickle supper! Yours, Algernon Wilhale (Connoisseur of the Finest Kebabs) xox",

Palmyra is legendary amongst Edinburgh students - if you've not been there then you've really not been on a good student night out, it's as simple as that. Firstly, the food is glorious - delicious pizzas piled high with gorgeous toppings, with loads of different choices of those toppings; succulently mouthwatering kebabs with fantastic sauces and wonderful khobz bread wraps; the best damned falafel in town, especially when taken in the falafel and hummus wrap; crispy pakora; various things of Lebanese origin that are delicious but remain a mystery to me; honey-soaked bacclava... The very thought is making me so greedily hungry I feel the need to abandon this and go there, perhaps this is why there's no review up for Palmyra yet... Anyway, (self control!) there's more. The prices are incredibly low, and there's a 10% student discount on top of that, as well as the 10\" margarita pizza for 2.50 offer... The service is totally brilliant - these are some of the friendliest guys in town, and one of them will even sing to you if you're there when he's feeling particularly chirpy! There's also quite a lot of seating, which lets the club-weary have a little sit down before embarking on the journey home, and the walls are covered in event posters, so you can plan your next night out while you eat. I absolutely ADORE Palmyra Pizza, and hope I will do so until my dying day.",

Not because I'd passed out in a toilet cubicle (happened once....once!).  No, the reason was simple: Palmyra closed at 3:00.  If takeaways were a race, then Palmyra would be their king!  Two words, one reason: Mixed Schwarma  Take kebab meat, take chicken, take salad, take chilli sauce and chilli flakes, take yogurt, take a wrap and seal it up on all sides, toasted on the grill, take... okay, starting to sound like Renton now. Gonna stop... you get the drift.  For that perfect 3am kebab fix, there are no competitors, absolutely nothing that immitates the amazing density, the mix of flavours, the balanced heat, the calorific glory that the Mixed Schwarma brings to the table.  I defy anyone to find a better kebab in the entirety of Edinburgh.  Since my late night clubbing days are few and far between these days, if I can find an excuse to be in that neck of the woods, I'll go, and lunch will be... you guessed it!  Pretty sure they do other stuff to.....",

The staff are fantastic and are always up for a laugh and a chat.  The place is a student hot spot as it is on the walk home from most of the clubs in Edinburgh to Pollock Halls, but even if it is not on the route home I will make a detour to make sure it is. During the day, they serve the food on plates, rather than the cardboard boxes they use at night and the pizzas also come with a chilli sauce and garlic sauce. They also sell a range of other food including falafels, kebabs and wraps.",

Food this good should be feasted upon stone cold sober, otherwise you won't appreciate it properly. Lebanese cuisine might not be too well known, and there's no point in denying that it's incredibly similar to Turkish kebab house fayre, but in the case of Palmyra, it's approximately 100 times better.  I got a mixed kebab, plated up so I could make my own mini kebabs with the flatbreads and yoghurt sauce supplied, and can't describe it any other way than mouth-watering. The chicken had a wonderful barbeque flavour, the donner was wafer thin and not greasy at all, the service was quick and friendly, and overall it was just a perfect experience in pretty much every way.  As good a kebb as I've eaten anywhere, and right in the middle of a little hub of middle-eastern cuisine round Nicholson Square, Palmyra is unmissable.",

But I was feeling adventurous that day, so I thought I'd try a small falafel and humous \"sandwich\", which is really a wrap. Oh my word, it was amazing. A veritable mixtape of textures and flavours with each bite, leading to me demolishing my lunch quicker than I thought possible.  Having gone back for the chicken shawerma twice since (which may have become my new favourite meal), I've become a convert and may just have to go back again next week. And the week after. And maybe the one after that...",

The doner kebab is amazing.  The meat isn't greasy and surprisingly flavourful.  Presented in a wrap rather then with a pitta bread, it removes any of the usual mess associated with a kebab and offers much more taste.  The fallafels are delicious here too. I don't know what's in that pink sauce they add, but it's the perfect accompaniment, uniting the salad and fallafel into a glorious package.   The prices are very good. A small fallafel comes in at around the 3 with a 10% student discount available on top of that. The service is very quick, except for the pizzas which take their time but I guess that's just a sign that they are being freshly made. The staff are friendly and there's plenty seating available.

It should be remembered that they dont serve chips which has disappointed a lot of people on various occassions.  This down side is more than made up for by the fantastic kebabs they serve. Say kebabs and an image of greasy grey meat pops into your head, here that image is dispelled. The chicken, falafel or lamb options are all delicious and freshs erved with a variety of sauces nd salad.  If you'd rather not eat on the go there are a few tables inside and they have a great waitress service. The sit in menu has more options including a delicious mezze platter and lamb koftas.  If you have any room once your done I highly recommend the baklava, sweet, sticky and delicious just how it should be.  The atmosphere in here is always welcoming.

I normally wouldn't like this sort of place but somehow Palmyra manages to offer decent kebabs and wraps which are for once not greasy, salty fast food crap!

However this place is probably best early evening when its not quite so busy or full of drunks but still has some atmosphere. Sit in or take away, Palmyra will put you right.  My personal favourite here is the fallafel wrap. Even the small size is pretty filling for me (and that's saying something). It's fantastic value for money! And the staff are really nice too.

Although there aren't too many seats inside, if you've got the time, sit down and enjoy your meal there - table service included.    Although their wraps and pizzas are no doubt tasty on the way home after seven pints, if you go in during the day the food is legitimately better.  In the day they take their time to construct the best wrap possible, and make sure it's fully heated through.  No cold falafel here.    That being said, I can only assume that the entire menu is good, as I always order the same thing: falafel wrap, no tomatoes.  (A friendly shot of abuse from the staff every time I pronounce tomatoes Canadian-style....'What's a to-may-to? We don't have those things here')  Bonus: student discount!",

The kebabs are great, I want to say with good quality ingredients, but to be honest I doubt any kebab has good quality ingredients. They are really tasty though, especially the chicken shawerma. The kebabs do come with everything (sauce and salad) so if you don't want anything in particular make sure you let them know otherwise you'll end up with the Full Monty.  The prices are good too, on average about 3.50 for a small and a fiver for a large. They do a 10% student discount, which is obviously in use on a Saturday night, when the queue is out the door with students coming back from Potterrow. The staff are really friendly too, and more than once my friends has got a smile discount for chatting to them. The only downside is that it shuts before the clubs kick out, but that is is the Edinburgh council's stupid laws, not Palmyra's fault",

The guys who own it are Syrian and are genuine and welcoming whilst providing good service to match.   They're kebabs are excellent and the menu has a wide range of chicken, donner and lamb, each with its own combination of salad and sauce.  I once had a falafel in here and, although drunk at the time, I swore it was one of the tastiest things I had ever eaten. The decor inside is nice and it feels a lot more civilised around lunch time with knives and forks, waiter service and a calm, relaxed atmosphere.  They have two branches on Nicholson Street and both of which do an excellent trade throughout the day due to the speed of service, the quality of the food and the general comfort of the place.  Whether you're looking for a cheap, quick and tasty place for lunch/dinner or a good munch after a night out, Palmyra is the place to go.",

The seating area is limited, but the wrap was surely designed to be eaten on the go. And for those heading back towards Pollock Halls from Potterow, the student discount is a major bonus.   Warning though: with your head buried in the wrap, you need to watch those stairs on the way out...",

The best thing about this place though is the staff, they are friendly and funny and sometimes somehow remember people that have only been in once or twice!   This isnt a place for the sophisticated, its a pizza shop after all! The perfect end to a mad night, make sure that at least one you wake up with their pizza sauce down your front on a Sunday morning!",

I ordered a small falafel (3.50) but got a 10% student discount upon showing my university card, making it a 3.15 falafel! The falafel looked as though it had not been previously frozen, the hummus was clearly homemade and the wraps were like the ones you get in Lebanon. The wrap was generously packed with salad, falafel and hummus and then toasted and conveniently wrapped in tin foil and a napkin.  The lighting inside is a bit dreary, as one expects when it comes to kebab shops, so we took the wraps home. They were super tasty! Fresh, filling and tasty. I couldn't finish mine as it was so big!  I will definitely be back when it need of something cheap, tasty and filling, though advise taking away!",

They basically only have pizza and wraps (no menu like the one in the pic) I was expecting a hole in the wall with yummy food. It was indeed a hole in the wall, but the food thoroughly disappointing. I ordered the kofta kebab wrap and hummus wrap both with no tomatoes. One came with tomatoes. Though the wrap was 10\" x 3\" the kofta hiding inside it was about 7\"x1\"-the veggie to meat ratio was ridiculous.  I guess that's what makes it a small? I did enjoy the sauce-creamy with a little spice.   My friend did make the point of why she thought it was highly rated. Nearby a university, open late, cheap, and quick...even considering all of that it's still a no for me.",

Fast forward a few drinks too many and we're walking out of the bar to a cash machine specifically so he can get a large falafel from Palmyra (he's vegan), stating he doesn't frequently eat out but this is worth it.  Two days later I'm looking for a quick lunch and get a small doner kebab--best kebab I've ever had, I swear.  It was more than enough to fill me for the whole afternoon.  Might be hit or miss though, I later returned and got the small shish kebab...firstly it's a 15 minute wait (versus approximately 1-2 minutes for the doner kebab) and it was neither as tasty nor as filling (seemed smaller tbh?).

So the craving at the time was schwarma, and Palmyra had some pretty decent reviews.   So off I moseyed in the hopes of getting a delicious meal. Not even 12pm yet, I was the only customer in the shop, nabbing a window seat so I could people watch during my lunch.   My server was so friendly and the service overall was great. I ordered a chicken schwarma with chips. I was kind of hoping for traditional Turkish bread, but my meal came on the thinner pita-style bread that didn't exactly hit the spot, but was delicious all the same.   The schwarma was large for 5.50 and my fries could have easily served two, the serving was massive. Also served with garlic sauce and a sweet type of chilli sauce.   Overall a flavourful and filling meal that I would certainly have again. For about 8 this meal could have served two and easily satisfied two grumbling bellies.",

One such word is \"saucy.\" At this juncture you may be asking yourself something along the lines of, why this word? Well I'll tell you, because if I didn't why would I have said anything about it in the first place? It's not because Palmyra is some lecherous gremlin hub, not because the foodstuffs are potent aphrodisiacs, and not because the contractors used tomato broth for mortar, but because (wait for it) they have boom baby bounce sauce. I would lap it up like a dog absolutely pooped out the wazoo from an evening's galavanting if this were a socially acceptable thing to do. In fact, I might do it anyway. Their sauce is a golden elixir, fit for the mightiest of Norse gods with the mightiest of pectorals, but accessible to the frantic doggy-poos lapping away.

With two branches near the university and surrounding bars/pubs, this is THE place to go when your late-night munchies kick in.  Whatever you're in the mood for, Palmyra have something to satisfy your junk food needs, whether it be a full-blown kebab, a pizza, the walking home staplefood of cheesy chips, or my personal favourite the humus and falafel wrap.  If your heels are hurting your feet, they have plenty of tables to sit at while you munch your way through your food, and the staff are always on hand with jokes and general banter. Or if you're keen to get home, they're more than happy to wrap everything up for you to take away.  In fact, my only criticism of Palmyra would be the opening hours. Only open until 2am, it does pose the dilemma of leaving a club early but getting food, or staying out later and going home hungry. However, the fact that it opens at 10am every day means they're always there to sort out your morning-after-the-night-before junk food craving the next day.  (Also at 6 Clerk Street, EH8 9HX)",
