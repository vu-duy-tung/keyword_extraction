    "text": "Inexplicably this is at the time of writing ninth in the category of Fast Food and American Restaurants in Edinburgh on Qype. I can think of a number of ways in which the popularity algorithm could be improved to avoid grossly misleading judgements like these. Ninth? Err Wrong! Bell's Diner's rightful place is at number one. It's the best place to get a burger in Edinburgh, and has been since this landmark Stockbridge establishment first appeared on the scene a generation ago. It was already legendary when I first went in 1990. It never lets me down: getting a table takes persistence, which is in itself a good sign (I love to fight for a table); the atmosphere is quiet, almost indifferent; the place itself small and of little consequence, but for quaint details like red walls, nicely worn wood, pretty glass and polished brass; the burgers - perfect, perfect, perfect. The fries, perfect. The sauces and mustards, just what you need. St Stephen Street is one of Edinburgh's best streets, and one of Stockbridge's most emblematic, and Bell's Diner is very much part of its identity. The sort of place that makes a street unique and special. But it's not a fossil - it's very much alive, and an integral part of life in Edinburgh.",

The meat was quality and had all the fixings as I would expect it. They also provide a large tray of sauces which is pretty cool. Lots of chutneys which is definitely a british influence, and the regulars (ketchup, mustard) though the mustard was spicy wholegrain mixed with english mustard so not what one would expect but i mixed it with some mayo and it did the trick.   Yes fully recommended. Finally.",

    "text": "I really would have loved to write a better review, but if I did I'd be lying, and I just can't lie.   Came in on a Friday night super excited for a burger- my partner and I had been waiting for this all week!   At 7pm the place was already full, but we were told if we could wait a few minutes a table would be available. So after some back and forth debtate, we decided to wait it out.   This establishment is small, I don't think it could seat more than 20 people. There are about 6 tables, all in close proximity.   Service was decent and we both just opted for the classic burger and fries combination.   The food came out not long after and it really wasn't anything to be amazed by, I could have made this burger at home. Fried were good but you know, fries are always good. Nothing proprietary here.   What I absolutely hated was the communal sauces concept- the whole idea just seems unhygienic and gross to me. There were a variety of sauces given to each table on a large platter, shared from table to table to have with your meal. One of the tubs was a tiny scraping of mayonnaise the other table had but we were given the rest of to finish- ugh, gross.   Overall quite underwhelming and did not hit the spot. I'm sure there are better burger joints around where you don't have to share the sauce.   I wouldn't return and I'm really disappointed- I was hoping to add this one to the list of local faves.",

The menu is burger-heavy, with various butters, cheeses, and sizes making up one's key decision points.   For the vegetarians, there's a burger, too. It's lentil-y and nutty and tastes pretty good, but doesn't hold together particularly well. The accompanying chips are average, but greatly accentuated by the fun tray of relishes and spreads that one can apply to them.   There are a good number of wines by the bottle (and a few by the glass), as well as an uninteresting assortment of bottled lagers on the drink menu.  The hot fudge sticky toffee pudding wrapped up the meal nicely.   Service was friendly and helpful.",

    "text": "A much anticipated visit to Bell's Diner was a bit of a random choice for a Monday night but Christmas was extremely busy and I needed a good meal out.  We had intentions of going elsewhere but when we parked up on St. Stephen St. And saw there were tables free, I suddenly had the urge to see if all the hype of Bell's was was justified.  Sarah and I were quiet impressed by the wine prices first of all and were pleased we got a great seat (by the window) in the restaurant, which was pleasingly busy for a cold, blustery Monday night.  Our server seemed a little unorthodox at first but really proved very competent; especially given she was the sole server in the restaurant.   I duly ordered a 6oz mustard burger (9.50) with a side of coleslaw (3.20) and Sarah a 4oz garlic burger (7.50 (I think?!)).   The smell of the chargrilled beef instantly made you want to just stuff the burger into your gob.   The mustard butter in mine maybe lacked the stong mustardy kick I expected but was still pleasant and started the debate as to 'where offers the best burger in Edinburgh?.'  Sarah seemed to woof her garlic burger a lot quicker than I was scoffing mine down but that was probably because I was enjoying the wonderful array of sauces Bell's offered on my chips.  OK, they were frozen chips I suspect (I love Noble's hand-made chips) but they were fine, and I loved the sauces as I mentioned.   The pickle, lettuce, tomato and red onion were all regular accompaniments for burgers but were fresh and decent and the sesame buns were good and didn't disintegrate in your hands.  I thought 3.20 for coleslaw was a bit steep and expected a small ramekin that could be consumed in a scoop, so I was pleased when my bowl of 'slaw was presented to me and even more satisfied when I tasted the wonderfully fresh, crunchy, creaminess of the plate.   The decor was kind of random and minimal but i kind of likes it and loved the music choices of old-school pop hits.   The superb burgers will stick in the memory and I'll definitely visit again but i still maybe prefer Noble's If I was looking for the best burger in the city; they're chips and buns are far better, although they lack the range of Bell's.",

    "text": "The best burgers in Edinburgh. Check.  Blink and you miss Bells, it's small intimate and quaint but oh does it deliver a mighty burger!  You'll find a variety of choices ranging from good ol classics like cheese and bacon to more exotic Roquefort and mushroom. There are also a few different meat sizes so even the biggest of appetite is catered for.  For me a burger is all about the bun and the meat, the bun should be soft, sesame topped and lightly toasted. The meat should be flavourful, slightly spicy and cooked medium to well. Not too much pink, and hold the leather. Perfect!  Now I love a sauce with my burger, the more the merrier, and its a good job you get a tray of 8 varieties of sauces, to douse your burger to your hearts content. I go for a different sauce with almost every bite. Weird I know, but you don't want to miss out now, do you?  I'm not a fan of milkshakes but there's a good range offered including beers and the usual soda drinks.  Now I mentioned that it was small, which means you're almost never going to get a table on a weekend without booking, so do yourself a favour and pick up the phone and book.  Because of it's size and the constant stream of people looking for a table, for me, it's not a place where you can hang around to socialise after your meal so for that reason 1 star down.  The best burger in Edinburgh is a controversial subject, I know, but I'm happy to play Bells as the ace up my sleeve.",

If you are a fan of sauces, then this is the place for you, they have a large tray full of different kinds of sauces, it was great to try them all.  I was swithering between giving this place 3 or 4 stars, but the thing that I felt really let this place down was the chips. They seemed to be just like oven chips.

Not that anything about the service or my meal was in any way bad, but ... well here's now it went down:  I called up and booked a table, I was informed that I would have the table for an hour and a half.  That seemed totally reasonable for two people having burgers.  When I arrived, I ended up being only 1 and a friend joined me after about 30 minutes.  I ate my burger at a speed you would expect of one person having a solo meal, and when my friend arrived I asked if she wanted a beer.  We turned to the waitress who checked if we had time and we discovered that the table had actually been booked for 7:30 which gave me exactly 1 hour to eat and go.  It took me 50 minutes to order, eat ONE course, and have a bit of a chat.  If I'd wanted a starter or a dessert, it definitely would have taken me longer than an hour.  In fact, the waitress didn't even ask if I wanted dessert, she just brought me the bill.    So, while it ended up being fine for us, I wasn't impressed that they would book people in so closely and not even offer a dessert menu for want of freeing up the table.",

    "text": "Being host to a very, VERY modest 6 tables its understandable why there's a long wait to book a table on a Friday or Saturday night. But once you've got your foot in the door you know that every burger (as burgers are their speciality) has been made lovingly and not in the industrious way that other high-street \"gourmet\" burger joints claim to be.   However, it's hard to keep in mind that real beef burgers with no additives tend to be a bit of the dry side which does lead to split second disappointment but you know it's been made well and worth it's cost.   The dark walls and thick curtains make it somewhere really rather special.",

    "text": "In the early days of our relationship, my boyfriend insisted on taking me here. The best burgers in Edinburgh he told me. Located in Stockbridge which convinced me even more that he was correct.  When we got there, I judged a book by a cover and thought- this place? Really? Boy I was wrong.  Bells Diner is so tiny you could miss it. There is only a few tables inside, and it reminded me of an old pub. I think it was the curtains that did it. Anyway, the specialty is the burger. There is a range of burgers to choose from, ranging from cheese to garlic. Being on a date, we both went for the garlic of course! And there is a choice of three sizes of burger. Now I am not much of a meat eater but the boyfriend convinced me to go for the medium size while he went for the large.   Well the boyfriend was correct, these are the best burgers in Edinburgh! I challenge you to find a fresher, more satisfying burger in Edinburgh. I loved the tray of sauces that is put on your table, it was a nice quirk and a change from the normal tomato sauce.   If you like burgers, make a trip to Bells Diner but make sure you book!",
