I had the Haggis with black pudding mash and talk about an experience. I really debated ordering another one just because it was really good and reminded me of something my mom made when I was young. I enjoyed every bite and was willing to order more. My wife ordered the Ox cheeks with black pudding mash and that was very good as well. The next time we ate I of course had the same thing but my wife tried the smoked Gammon with bacon mash and that was really good. I would order that  if we ever go back again. We enjoyed the Belhaven Black beer and that was delicious. The service both times was great. We had three children in our group and they sat us away so we can make us much noise as we need the boys really enjoyed their tomato soup and both cleaned their bowl. Let's not forget their dessert sticky toffee pudding, out of this world good. We love this place and you must try it if your in town.",

The bar tender/waitress recommended the hard apple cider while we were waiting, it tasted really good. I had the wild boar sausages with the black pudding mash and the hubby had the grilled chicken with cheese and chive mash. They were both delicious. The sausages were so flavorful and meaty. The chicken was tender and juicy. The mash was silky and tasty with nice black pudding texture. The cheese and chive mash was really good as well. I had the sticky toffee pudding with a glass Balvenie whisky to complete the meal. The pudding was so fluffy in texture and so fragrant in taste, it was probably the best sticky toffee pudding I've had. The whisky had a nice fruity notes and it went well with the sweetness of the dessert.   It was a wonderful dining experience. I definitely recommend this place and would love to come back again when visiting Edinburgh.",

We received a heaping proportion of both, and they were delicious. The smoked sausage came with this tart cream and crisp radish slaw, which really cut down on the heaviness. Our waitress was very sweet and gave us great service, and took her time to explain the menu when she saw that we were tourists with little experience with Scottish food.

We came across this restaurant and was pleasantly surprised.   We ordered Mini Haggis (national dish of Scotland), Beef Short Ribs and Smoked Sausages. The main entrees comes with \"Mash\" which you get to choose how your potatoes are cooked. My favorite Mash was the cheese/chive Mash. The butter/cream mash was good if you want a clean taste and the roasted crispy potato skin was too hard for my liking.  Based off taste alone, you wouldn't know what the Haggis is made of. It was good and I would recommend not finding out until you have tried the dish. The Beef Short Ribs were tender and tasteful but had slight fat around it. The Smoke Sausages were great as we ordered another dish after having it.  Small complaints: 1) Table was really sticky... Every part of my side was untouchable.  2) I should have asked for more ice to go with my coke. I'm sure the server would have brought me some more.",

The lamb shank was \"fall off the bone\" tender and came with delicious bacon mashed potatoes. The house salad was also very good with a delicious mustard vinagerette. The service was also incredible. When the kitchen mistakenly sent my salad to another table, one of the waitresses apologized many times, gave me a big discount, and rushed my dinner. Another salad and lamb shank appeared about 5 minutes later. The view over the Princes Street Gardens and proximity to Edinburgh Castle are other pluses. I highly recommend you check out this place.",

I have had most of the mains, I had the roast gammon last night and it was delicious. The mash bar part of the name comes from the side of mashed potatoes the meat is placed on. There are different renderings of the mashed 'tatties' and they are good. I also recommend the haggis starter.   Come summer you will need a reservations. It's not a big place and tables go quickly. Also, if you arrive late your menu choices may be limited as they run out of roasts.",

(The mashed potatoes taste just like mashed potatoes on the lighter/healthier side, which worked fine with the robust flavors of everything else and are a very good balance to the richness of the signature chicken.) The seasonal side salad with pickled vegetable garnish (which I got without added dressing) was one of the most delicious salads I have ever tasted. Dessert looked extraordinary as well, but no room for it. (Ate at the Mound location.) I do need to take a point off for a crap cup of tea -- watery and tasteless. I can't imagine what happened. But everything else was so amazing that it still rounds up to 5 stars.",

Only downside was the service here - seemed not only slow, but just not motivated to help or make recommendations.  Also, be sure to tell your server to put all food orders in at once (appetizers and mains), as otherwise you will wait 45 min to get your main.  Would definitely go again.  Great food!",

Well, it was absolutely amazing, and a large enough portion served with mashed potatoes (I got cheddar and chive), that you don't go hungry (: I suggest to anyone passing through Edinburgh to give this place a go, definitely worth it!",

And then we had a the Edinburgh Gin in the Raspberry flavor mixed with prosecco and it was the perfect little cocktail. Really great stuff. Seems like a very nice place to come for a full meal.

Ox cheek with blood sausage mashed potatoes also fantastic. Ox cheek very soft. Hard to taste the blood sausage since it was mixed into the mashed potatoes.   Fries with haggis was decent. I prefer the mini haggis because I couldn't really taste the haggis with the fries.   Solid dishes here to try Scottish dishes. Unfortunately I didn't get to try the Scottish eggs because they ran out.",

Casual atmosphere and with pretty good options for food.  We had SCOTCH EGG to start, which was scrumptious. I ordered Makars Wild Boar Sausage in onion Gravy and my wife ordered Bonnie Prince Charlie Char grilled Chicken in a Whisky Peppercorn & Mustard Sauce. All meals come with a nice heap of mash (mashed potato) with a few favor options. Mash was excellent, felt Chicken had better flavor profile compared to Sausage and the Whisky sauce was delicious. Overall, amazing flavors, fantastic experience!",

Most of us had a variation of their several Sausages and Mash Dishes (the Traditional, the Wild Boar Sausage, the Beef & Black Pudding Sausage) - all really good. Was surprised to find that the Beef & Black Pudding Sausage was actually the tastiest of the three. My wife had the Peppercorn Mustard Chicken which was equally tasty, and my other son had the Honey Soaked Smoked Gammon and Mash which he Loved(!)... (see our pics of the various dishes).  We learned Gammon is like a cured slab of Ham, in this case basted with honey & served w/cranberry sauce. Very Tasty! We also got to taste Haggis!!! Our waitress - Sasha, (who was Awesome by the way!) Recommended we order a \"Childs Portion\" which was much lower cost than the full-size entre, just so we could all sample the (Mustard Peppercorn Beef) Haggis. We did, and it worked out perfectly! Tasty dish in spite of the 'graphic list of ingredients'! Drinks were also great... had a Pint of \"Twisted Thistle\" IPA from 'Bellhaven Brewery' and my son had a Hollyrood Pale Ale from the same brewery. Both good... I actually liked his Pale better! We ordered Dessert as well and we were not disappointed! Scotch Pudding was great... we also had Brownie & Ice Cream and a Mango Sherbet. All very tasty. And the service was stellar! Great departure night dinner at Makars! They earned their 5-Star rating.   :-)",

    "text": "After a long walk in the Old Town part of Edinburgh we were both hungry and cold. Where to go?   After about 5 minutes of Yelping me and my boyfriend had decided to eat at the, according to yelp, enormously popular and delicious Makars Gourmet Mash Bar.  We entered and it was completely full. A deal was made with the waitress and she gave us a device that would buzz when a table was free and we waited at a nearby pub. We were told it would take 45 minutes. With 30 minutes to go to the 45 minute deadline the buzzer started buzzing. We left our half-finished Guinness pints and went back next door to the Mash bar.  Makars Mash Bar is, as you can guess, a restaurant which specializes on mash.  First you choose your meat. We went for Honey-Glazed Gammon Steak and Brisket with Mushroom Gravy.   Then you choose your mash. The Gammon was paired with Bacon and Spring Onion Mash and the Beef with Butter and Cream Mash.  The food was amazing. Especially considering that the restaurant is a mix between a fast food joint and a restaurant.   Why only 3 stars? We were seated near the steps down to the basement where the toilets were located. And terrible smells kept on coming up from the basement. A total mood-killer.  Go here, get a table near the entrance and indulge in creamy, rich and delicious mash",

For the most part in our trip around the British Isles, we've been fed similar foods, buffets, etc. This changed our perception of how we think of UK/SCOTTISH food. I ordered the Gammon with Black Pudding. I've never had pork so tender and pretty. The black mud pudding, which was inside the mash, was surprisingly tasteful. It had a spice to it. My mom and sister both ordered the Chicken, also tender and delicious. The table decided to order the chocolate toffee with ice cream. The toffee was delicious and the restaurant was great. Friendly staff, cool environment, 5 stars.",

I opted for the sausages as they were supposed to be less 'mushy'.   Best veggie sausages ever? No, not quite. But they were good enough. Mash was decent but nothing spectacular. I was a bit disappointed that it only came with a bit of gravy and coleslaw.   My partner's gammon, while tasty, came as a thick slab which made is difficult to cut and eat. He would have preferred thinner slices.   That said, great selection on the menu. Something for everyone! And fun lively environment too.",

My gal and I were hungry and I was thinking what could I get thats above average in country.  I landed on sausage and mash potatoes.  Also called, \"Bangers and Mash\" in Great Britain.  We asked around and Makars was the spot.  we ran out of the pub we were in and went straight to the Makars near us.  we came in about a half hour before they closed.  I asked if we could eat and the gal working the front said probably not, in a depressing way.  we said \"really, ok\", and walked out.   We stood outside and asked each other if that was common to just not serve 30 minutes before closing.... We waked in and said \"we are ordering\" and she said ok, but that we would have to order soon, and we agreed.  It had become clear to us she was just not trying.   When we got our order it made up for the shoddy service.  The mash potatoes(what they are known for), were fantastic.  The wild boar that came with mine was incredible as well.  juicy. robust and full of spice.   We were so happy we had gone in a second time to insist on dinner.  It was a great and hearty meal.",

We have never had Sticky Toffee Pudding so we decided to try theirs and now I'm depressed we will not be able to get it in the states. Theirs literally melted in our mouth like cotton candy.

    "text": "We took a day trip from London to visit historic Edinburgh. I wanted to find an authentic Scottish eatery for a late lunch before beginning our journey back to London. We were drawn to this spot because of the 5 star reviews we discovered on Yelp.   The previous raters were absolutely correct. The food was great. I had the \"Slow Cooked Beef Skirt\" and I had the \"Bonnie Prince Charlie Chargrilled Chicken\". My wife said it was the most tender beef she had ever eaten.   Our  service team of Macha, Andriama, Callie and Adam were  fantastic and took the time to explain the menu choices to us. They kept are glasses full but didn't rush us out and gave us a chance to slowly enjoy our second pint of \"Stewart's Lager\".  A very fine brew by the way.      It's a bit of a climb up the hill from Waverley Station but trust me the food is worth the climb.   I recommend making a booking if you plan to dine after 18:00. It began crowding as we finished our visit.",

Yet again, a tasty experience I probably never would have stumbled upon had it not been for finding the reviews of this eatery located an alley/block removed from The Royal Mile hustle and bustle. We were curious about the \"mash\" menu and had to experience it for ourselves. The mashes are smashed potato variations ranging from chive and cheddar to horseradish that paired beautifully with entrees like pot roast (crazy tender- the star of the show at our table).   In addition to the pot roast, we ordered the rhubarb soda (locally made and delicious), honey carrot soup, beets and local cheese salad, and a variety of the mashes. The horseradish was my favorite. The waitress was very sweet and friendly and you could tell this business was passionate about sharing their story and highlighting local Scottish farmers and producers through the clever layout of the menu. If you're looking for a spot outside, they have three or four picnics tables available under the tree. This ended up being one of our favorite meals during our time in Scotland.",

It was quite busy for mid-afternoon on a Tuesday, but we were able to get a table without a reservation; however, the service was a bit on the slower side. I should have known, being in the heart of the tourist area near The Royal Mile and castle, what I would likely be getting us into. The quality and taste of the food, in my opinion, is not worth the higher prices here. I ordered the lamb shank with spring onion and smoked sausage mash (I asked our server for their mash recommendation to pair with the lamb; I should have just picked myself, as I was disappointed that the sausage tasted quite a bit like hot dog). Parts of the lamb were tender and moist and others were dry and rough. I thought the Shiraz wine I selected paired well with the flavor of the lamb, which was mainly what I liked about my meal. My husband ordered the chicken with black pudding mash (just go with it, don't ask what's in it because it won't sound appetizing) and thought it was okay. The chicken was slightly overcooked (borderline dry) and didn't have much flavor to it. He enjoyed his IPA beer. The portions are pretty large and heavy. Overall, although this place seems overpriced, I'm glad we tried it for the novelty of having the opportunity to eat some traditional Scottish food; however, we weren't impressed and wouldn't return.",

Tomato soup was fantastic with chunks of tomatoes and great flavor. Then I had the haggis skins and mist say their haggis is amazing! Very happy with my selections.",

    "text": "This place is perfect! Stopped in with my family after walking the busy streets of the Royal Mile. We looked at so many spots that were either overpriced, too busy, or not busy at all (never a good sign) and finally stumbled across this restaurant for a 6pm Saturday dinner. Our party of 6 was seated right away and we had so many options from drinks to food. As a vegetarian I had a good amount of choices to pick from and my veggie sausage and rosti were so so so delicious. My dinner is of my favorite dishes to date because the whisky cream sauce was so rich and flavorful. My family loved the chicken, lamb, haggis, and the different mashes as well. Service was kind, friendly, and reasonably quick. Prices were good too for the quality and amount of food. Can't recommend this spot enough and shoutout to Sophie, Louise, and Jamie who seated and served us!",

    "text": "I had a lovely dinner with a friend here. The ambiance and decor was great, and the server we had was really nice and friendly. We came on a voucher deal and enjoyed prosecco and the lamb and mash. Part of my lamb was cold which wasn't great but otherwise the dish had good flavour and was a very big portion. Once we had finished, both our normal server and another server kept coming over to ask if we wanted anything else. Although  they were probably trying to be friendly and helpful, it felt like they wanted us to buy more or head out although there were empty tables around so we weren't in the way. Overall, it was a nice dinner but I wouldn't rush back if not on a voucher.",

An added bonus of this place is the beer and spirits selections, as well as the fact that it's an independently owned Edinburgh establishment, which makes it a dying breed.",

Save room for dessert because the sticky toffee pudding is marvelous.",
