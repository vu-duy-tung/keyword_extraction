    "text": "After wandering around the streets looking for somewhere to get a nice lunch on our final day in Edinburgh, we came across this place. We'd been looking at the menu outside 'David Bann', the vegetarian restaurant around the corner. We would have gone there if they had a lunch menu, but with it being our final day we had virtually spent up, so didn't quite want to pay the prices of David Bann.   We looked at the menu outside the Holyrood, and after a quick check on Yelp decided this would be a good call.   It's cosy inside, especially with the current Christmas decor. The boyfriend had a halloumi burger which he hailed to be delicious. I also wanted halloumi, but something lighter than a burger after 3 days of over indulgence. There is a halloumi salad on the menu, but I preferred the look of the cesar salad, so opted for this substituting the chicken for halloumi, which was no problem at all. It was lovely.   We stayed here quite a while as there was Blue Moon available, my favourite beer at the moment, which they served properly with a slice of orange.   All in all great lunch with great beer.",

The place is busy as usual, but they always try to find a way to squeeze you in.   \"In Holyrood 9A you are ensured of a good burger!\" that is what they told me. I know that is a bold statement and I put it to the test. I ordered, I received and ...mmmm, that is some tasty burger man. Juicy, firm and compact. The bun: crunchy and light. The filling: plentiful and tasty.   I vote this to be one of the better burgers consumed in a long while.  Anita had a halloumi burger and she was well impressed.   For afters we shared a selection of desserts, 3 bowls of ice-cream & wafers and a lemon cheesecake. Yummy to the max.  The espressos were OK - they could have been a bit stronger.   My other pleasant finding was the real ale and craft lagers on offer.   I like this place for their food, still have to taste the atmosphere when just drinking, but with those beers & cocktails on the menu, that should not pose a big problem.",

    "text": "Even though I'm not a massive fan of burgers I have a soft spot in my heart for Holyrood 9A, I went to my first ever Yelp event here when Jenny.L hosted a CYME evening of burgers and beers and chit chat. Even though it's sister pub, The Southern, is much closer to my humble abode, I will still go out of my way to eat here instead.   They do burgers well here; in fact I'd say they do the best burger in the city. A tall order, I know, but they do little else on their menu but burgers so they have to get it right. And we're not just talking plan beef burgers; the menu has various different meats such as lamb, venison and haggis to keep things different. My meal of choice was always the steak sandwich but it has disappeared since the recent change of the menu. This is both a good and bad thing. It's a bad thing because the steak sandwich was damn tasty and I'll miss it; but it's also a good thing because it has forced me to try more on the menu so I can choose a new favourite burger.   On my last visit I decided to give The Pioneer a go. This beef burger is served with sauted rosemary wild mushrooms, bacon, swiss cheese and garlic mayo. You also have the choice to change the sour dough bun to a brioche or change your skinny fries to chunky, piri piri, or sweet potato fries. ( I stayed with the sour dough and plumped for the chunky chips.) The burger itself was gorgeous but a little messy. A combination of a juicy beef burger, mushrooms and perhaps too generous a portion of garlic mayo resulted in a VERY drippy burger. I needed a couple of napkins to clean up my fingers after having several comments about being a messy eater fired my way by my fellow dinners. (Totally not my fault.)   I don't drink but I am told by those that do that the bar is also very well stocked with good quality craft beers. You can get beers like Innis and Gunn or Thistly Cross cider which seem to be very popular with Yelpers.    I also love the decor and cosy feel of the place. The main area is a very wide open space, but the dark wood panelling and the lighting make it feel much more inviting and contained. The staff are all pretty stunning looking themselves, I wonder if they only hire good looking people to fit in with the feel of the place.   The quest to find my new favourite burger continues, which one should I try next?",

    "text": "I'm going to say - it's a waver between 4 and 5 stars, but where there is a waver, gotta go with the lower bid, but ehh.. not this time. Usually I would coo and goo over how amazing a 5-star place is, and I will, but it does have some parts that let me down more. That's not to say this is a bad place, sheesh, no it's really not. But, when beer is of eye watering prices (OK OK OK so it's not your average draft and 9A stock some GOOD beer), I'm tempted to go with 4. It's just a bit pricier than I am willing on average to pay for beer and burgers. It also seems a horrendously busy pub on a Friday night, I guess that's what you get for being good at what you do.  But! Did I have an excellent evening? Yes. Was the service good? Yes! Apart from one really grumpy kid... he should consider his career options, soon. Were the burgers good? Yes! Starters? Yes! Although on that front, my pita, houmous and olives seemed to far outweigh the size of other plates, even sharing ones - so it was shared, but in future, more houmous less pita please - I found myself sparingly taking portions of houmous one mushy grain at a time in order to try to spread it out.    Meals wise we had a medley of mainly burgers (and one steak) - from the Holyrood 9A, to pork and chorizo, and the one 'awkward' one, that settled for the halloumi burger. The smoked chilli mayo did it for me. So did the sweet potato fries. Life is good when you have sweet potato fries. However, the chilli mayo was too overpowering for me, and I couldn't really taste anything else of my burger, and the only smoke I could find was that billowing from my ears. I kept desparately reaching for the cooling effect of the slice of tomato in my burger, but it could only last for so long. It's not awful, it was just too much - perhaps if you are not such a chilli-hound (like myself) perhaps putting the sauce on the side might be a more cunning plan to remember in the future.   We also split across our party a couple of kitchen sinks as dessert - as gooey-ly gratifying as it implies, but across four didn't result in total coma.   Overall, Holyrood 9A did everything we wanted for our Christmas night out, and for that we thank you.",

    "text": "The Holyrood is a Bavarian style burger with beer mustard, Hereford Hop, rocket, red onion, and caramelized onion mayo. The star of the burger was the Hereford Hop cheese, which was melted to perfection, and paired very well with mustard and red onion. The caramelized onion mayo added an additional depth of creamy flavor to the burger making the condiments really work together. Unfortunately, because of these bold flavors the beef did not get a chance to stand out on the burger and the bun was only average. Overall, the Holyrood is a solid burger but it could have benefited from a juicier piece of beer or a pillowy bun to make each bite a bit more savory.",

    "text": "If you get into a discussion about the best burgers in Edinburgh the \"Holyrood 9a\" will come up, if you get into a discussion about the best \"craft\" beers in Edinburgh the \"Holyrood 9a\" will again come up, and deservedly so, they do really good burgers and a really good range of beers. As they celebrated their fourth birthday yesterday I thought it was about time I returned and wrote a review. I have visited here numerous times and never been disappointed, be warned it can get very busy, although it is quite spacious, it can get very crowded and some of their beers can be expensive (this usually reflects their high strength or rarity).  It's location isn't very convenient for the centre of town but worth the short stroll and IS well situated if you are visiting the Cannongate, Holyrood or Arthur's seat (not to forget Dynamic Earth or the Pleasance courtyard during the Fringe). Unlike most of the pubs around the Royal Mile it is not aimed at the tourist trade and is popular with local office workers and students in the area. This is reflected in the decor which is traditional but not \"touristy\". The front half of the bar is fairly open and has mostly small tables and a number of bar stools, the back half being a bit darker and secluded/cosier.  I visited just after lunchtime on a Wednesday afternoon and although not packed there was a good number of customers, including your traditional beer drinkers, groups of young ladies drinking wine/mixers and the odd tele-worker (there was a young lady drinking a pot of flavoured tea while she worked on her laptop sitting at the table beside me). I enjoyed a couple beers I had not tried before and a bacon cheese burger. The burger was excellent and came with \"stringy\" fries and coleslaw as standard, the bacon could have been cooked a bit longer (but I do like my bacon crispy!).  Owned by \"Fuller Thomson\" it is in the same style as \"The Red Squirrel\" & \"The Southern\" (The 9A was the first, the others followed a similar formula, although each has it's own character), a large range of draft \"craft\" beers and a large menu of quality burgers (they also do a smaller selection of other food including a breakfast selection before midday). I won't reiterate what the previous reviews have already said. I will say, after being open for four years this bar is still serving top quality burgers and beer and has no doubt become an \"institution\" for many students and locals.  I'll leave it to you to decide if it is THE best burger and beer in Edinburgh.",

    "text": "Holyrood 9A is unlike it's siblings (The Southern & The Red Squirrel) in the sense that it has a divide between drinking and dinning area. The front bar area tends to fill up Thursday to Saturday evenings however if you get a seat here it is comfortable and has a very similar feel to sitting in The Southern. If on the other hand you are sitting at the back to eat your burger there is a bit of a feeling that the staff want to turnover the table, rather than have you sit and drink a few beers.  The burgers and the beers are great, the bar has a good pub vibe, however the back area seating isn't a natural resting place to drown a few pints. Personally I feel that The Southern pips it at the post a little and is the better bar, but I am a fan of Holyrood 9A.",

    "text": "To think I've known about this place for ages (and used to work v near it actually) but never bothered to go in?!? I feel ashamed.    My very first experience of Holyrood 9A was on Friday night, as a pre-gig (at the Pleasance) meeting place. I loved it! It was jam packed with people so I really felt like I'd been missing a trick - and I had! It has a really cool vibe and relaxed atmosphere without trying hard. It's the type of place you just wanna drink in, especially if you are a beer lover as you have a million & 1 varieties to choose from that seem to change on a regular basis.  The waft of burgers smelled so appetising ...drool. Unfortunately we didn't book in advance (losers!), so the the chance of getting a table on a fri night appeared to be slim to none, but we all agreed we would go back, ready and willing to tackle the huge menu of burgers on offer!   I didn't feel justified scoring this place higher based on 1 experience of drinks only (standing at the bar at that!). However on my 2nd visit, IF the burgers are as good as they smelled and looked, I may even score the place 5 stars depending on the speed and quality of service.  Another positive is that I work right opposite their sister place (The Red Squirrel on Lothian Rd) and I HAVE partaken of yummy burger there and will again! :)",

They are part of the Fuller Thompson pubs group so the Southern and the Red Squirrel also have the same menu. There is a great selection of beers from around the world behind the bar - I think 11 are always on draft and lots of bottles too, and the burger menu had plenty of choice for every taste.  The service is always quick, and the portions generous. I love the Pioneer Burger although the pork and chorizo is also tasty. Next on the list is the chilli death burger! Chips are great and you can get sweet potato fries too. The staff are generally really friendly and the decor is a little more upmarket than your average boozer. If you fancy some lunch, or a bite to eat in a relaxing environment not too far off the royal mile/high street then this is your place. For us locals its a fab place to catch up with firends over a drink and some great grub!",

    "text": "My husband and I dined at Holyrood on New Years Eve via a reservation we made about a month prior. From making the reservation to arriving at the restaurant, I felt the administration part of the business was completely unorganized. When I called to make the reservation, I spoke to two people before finally being passed to the person handling reservations. When I received a voicemail from the Holyrood asking if we wanted to order off the festive menu or not and I called back, I again spoke to two people before finally speaking to someone who was in a position to understand and note that we did not want to order off the festive menu. When we arrived at the restaurant at our appointed time, we again were passed to three different people before being seated. With all the disorganization on the administration side of things, I was surprised that they actually had our reservation on the books. So, a half-star deduction because of this.  The food was good though not exceptional. My initial reaction was how fast it flew out of the kitchen and how small the kitchen was (and that only one person was working the kitchen). We started with the pickles (homemade and very good) followed by the spiced popcorn (stale and not spiced at all) and onion rings (hot, delicious, yum).  I ordered the chicken BBQ burger. I was a huge fan of the BBQ sauce but the burger fell short when it came to the cheese. The cheese was not a cheese slice but rather a dollop of cheese in the middle of the chicken breast. I couldn't taste the cheese, therefore should have asked to have it omitted as it was a waste of calories and calories are really what one is thinking about on the biggest binge eating and drinking night of the year! LOL. The fries were shoestring fries which are my favorite and they were good but maybe not the freshest shoestring fries on the block.  My husband ordered a beef burger and mentioned that, \"eh, it was a burger.\" He also mentioned that he didn't think they put cheese on his burger and I explained that he needed to look for a small dollop on top of the patty. He found the dollop of cheese under my guidance.  So, overall, the food was good - good enough that I would return. I do have one problem with the food, however. My problem is the unconventional serving platter the food is served on. It's a piece of wood. While I think a piece of wood in place of a traditional plate is cool and trendy, it's not functional. Also in the category of non-functional ways to serve food is on a piece of slate. Since there is no \"rim\" on a piece of wood or slate, ketchup gets everywhere. Food falls off the wood platter and on to the table and, yeah, it just doesn't work. I wish restaurants would stop using wooden platters and pieces of slate.  The service was hit-and-miss. Our table was located in a corner of the backroom which meant that we were constantly overlooked by servers passing by. But that's not my biggest issues with the service. My biggest issue with the service is technology. When you order, the server taps in your order on an iPad mini. There is something I find completely dis-genuine about servers using iPads and other devices of the like for taking orders. I'd go so far as to say that I hate it but I'm not living under a rock. I understand that probably all restaurants will be using these types of systems within five years. I get it. My problem with it is that if my server is just going to punch in some data into an iPad, why not just have an iPad at each table where I can punch my order in myself? I'd get better service this way as I could trigger another drink order when I was ready versus having to flag down my server. So, another half star off.  In addition, the software running on the iPad was lacking in some basic functionality. For example, our server had to punch in our order in the order of starter, main, dessert. We happened to order our mains first and then added on our starters and she had to delete the order and start over. This meant that we had to repeat our orders. This is not efficient and is, actually, quite frustrating on both ends. Our server said, \"I so badly want to go back to pen and paper.\" And then she said, \"Sorry this is taking so long. There are just so many tiny boxes that I have to carefully select.\"  The tiny box problem likely explains why my husband received a Punk beer instead of a pumpkin beer. Our server probably fat-fingered the tiny boxes and selected Punk instead of pumpkin.  Finally, the toilets (women's). They need improvement. They are way too small.",

Situated just off the crossroads between the Pleasance and St. Mary's Street, 9A offers a stylish setting to the office crowd, students and regulars of its old incarnation (name escapes me... little help?) alike. The slick interior has a warm charm about it that many modern bars fail to deliver, making it an easy choice for a quick drink or a bite.  Speaking of which... although 9A can boast a trendy-yet-not-central-bar claim, the ace up their sleeve is their extensive and classy range of burgers. The variety alone is enough to drop a jaw here or there.   And the quality of their product? Well I probably couldn't count the number of 9A burgers I've had on two hands (I am the Duke after all!), but I've yet to experience a bad one.  Scratch that; a mediocre one! They're simply awesome. My firm favourite being the Venison Burger; thick and juicy, topped with a wedge of brie and cranberry relish. Well if that don't have you drooling.... you're probably a vegetarian....!  Other notables are the Haggis Burger, the Pork & Apple, and the Pioneer (topped with rosemary-scented mushrooms,bacon, swiss and a garlic mayo). They do veggie option, they do breakfast, they do finger food, they do desserts, but it's simply all about the burgers at 9A. All come served with a side of red cabbage coleslaw and a cup of fries (upgrade to Piri Piri fries for better days - fact!).  Of course it takes a lot for a bar to fall under \"perfect\". 9A has its flaws. The first of which being the prices; the 3.40 mark seems to be the standard for the range of spirits on offer, and although I'm no beer drinker, I hear the asking price for certain tipples are closer to the 5 mark, per pint. High street prices from a bar that sits arguably on the border of student land (Pleasance, Cowgate, et al) is a bit of an ask, and I'm sure if they lowered their prices, they would benefit from increased midweek custom from the student crowds.  The other blemish on 9A's reputation is short and simple: turn on the bleedin telly! Fair enough the manager maybe doesn't want a rowdy football crowd coming in to watch the FA Cup, but I've seen my fair share of idiots on a Friday afternoon so they're not really keeping that crowd away regardless. And I don't think it's too much to ask that they show the tennis when I ask.  Great bar, made great by a) the friendly, personable staff (wouldn't be my Cheers bar if they weren't!); b) the quality food served up; and c) the clientele that frequent the joint. A great social regular, marred only by overzealous prices and a stuffy manager.  But don't let him keep you away. Go, go now.  The Duke has spoken.  POST REVIEW UPDATE:- Stuffy manager has left the building! 5 Stars all the way!",

Not too overbearing, not too shoddy. Just right.   I had an original burger, because I'm a plain kind of girl. The food took a wee while to come but when it did it was worth it because IT WAS THE BEST BURGER I'VE EVER HAD. Well, so far anyway.   The cocktails were also grand but I was left unable to stomach another meal all weekend, so it must have been good!  Would recommend if you're about. The burgers are too tasty.",

A great little pub with ultra friendly staff, good service and a place that felt like it had a decent amount of atmosphere in it even though it was mid afternoon.   With a menu that boasts a huge selection of gourmet burgers, I managed to narrow it down to the Haggis burger or the Pork and chorizo with guacamole. It's safe to say I made a wise choice by following my love of mexican with a hint of spice as it was super tasty, but the haggis one is definitely on my list for my next visit north of the border.

I obviously ordered the haggis burger and it was possibly the best tasting meal I had in my entire time in Edinburgh!  The price was reasonable considering the amount of food; a got a huge burger, a bowlful of chips and some sauce on the side. I could barely finish it but it was so tasty! The drink selection is also worth pursuing. The staff are very knowledgable and helped me pick a drink that would go with my food.  The layout and ambiance give the bar a laid back feel. There was a mix of students and business persons, and it wan't too busy, even on a friday.

To be fair to Holyrood, they seem to be extremely popular, as it is always full and super nosy. It seems to be a common place to come after work, popular for groups, with lots of beer and burgers. Really, what isn't to like I guess. The burgers run around 10-12 quid and the beer is generally 3-4 on tap. Lots of beers, but I haven't found one I loved yet. I think it is a great stop for one drink and a quick bite, I've had the sweet potato fries there and they are good, so imagine the food must be as people are constantly filling up the seats to get them. One day I will try the burgers, but maybe before the post-work rush, as it is very hard to find a seat unless you book in advance.",

    "text": "The Holyrood 9A is the best of the three sister pubs which includes The Southern and Red Squirrel (in my humble opinion).  The pub is divided up into three sections, a small alvove to the rght as you walk in, the main middle bit bith the bar and a large area to the rear which is where most of the burgers are devoured. Painted black on the inside it can look a bit divey but with the walls are adorned with stag heads and typographic prints, and the huge candles, there is an eerie feel to this hipster-ish bar, definitely Edinburgh-esque!  In keeping with it's sisters, though if I'm not mistaken this was the original, this place has an extensive burger menu. Everything you could ask for from a shmancy venison with brie (my personal favourite) to a good old cheese and bacon and everything in between. Burgers are served with chips (sweet potato and piri piri are options but be warned, sweet potato can run out fast on a busy night!) and some red cabbage coleslaw. The burgers are decent portions so bring your appetite.  If burgers aren't your thing there's plenty more to choose from, though shamefully I haven't ventured from that middle column on the menu just yet.   There's also a decent dessert selection, the kitchen sink is always a favourite when I bring anyone visiting. Aptly named you need at least 3 people, though I've seen six go at it (after nachos and burgers mind) and struggle. Ice cream and brownies galore!  The beer selection is also impressive. Being not much of a beer drinker (understatement!) I don't partake, but I will say the cider selection could do with some improvement.The staff are lovely, though they can be on the slow side.   Overall the Holyrood 9A is a safe pair of hands for a decent burger!",

It wasn't terrible - I was just expecting something a bit edgier.

It was just kind of bland and stodgy. I think the menu said the bun was a brioche, and while I don't particularly like brioche, it definitely seemed like the most ordinary plain burger bun instead.

    "text": "It doesn't feel that many years ago that you really struggled to get a decent beer in Edinburgh, yet now there is a new craft beer bar opening up every week. Holyrood 9A, therefore, probably counts as one of the old-timers in the craft beer scene and follows the familiar formula of regularly changing guest beers but where is differs from most is the quality of the food.  You must try the Sweet Potato Fries! They are tremendous, the burgers are great too, but SWEET POTATO FRIES, order them on their own or with a burger, just try them.  There are three distinct seating areas but my favourite is in the back room where the candles are creating their own artwork by melting around the fireplace and it's a great bit of the bar to eat sweet potato fries!",

    "text": "Saw this place on a Guardian top 10 cheap eats list, and as we were in Edinburgh with no dinner reservations on a Friday night, we turned to the list to try and find a place where we could manage to grab a table and a quick bite.  Holyrood 9A is a great pub - dark, warm, and cozy with a massive draft beer list that made my husband very happy.  For my part, the haggis bonbons made me very happy!  Absolutely delicious, hot crispy fried balls of haggis (obviously) to be dipped in tangy beer mustard mayo.  The haggis was spiced and savory, and even if you think haggis doesn't sound appetizing, you'll like these.  They're an absolutely top-notch bar snack.  I didn't find the rest of the food to live up to expectations, unfortunately!  My husband got the Ecosse burger (with sausage, red onion, brie, rocket, and truffle mayo) and I got the Chc - grilled chicken breast with serrano ham, emmantal cheese, sunblush tomatoes, and basil mayo.  How meals that sound so flavorful can taste rather bland is utterly beyond me!  My chicken was dry, and I just simply couldn't taste enough of the ham, cheese, tomatoes, and mayo.  I could see them there, but any flavor they contributed was rather overpowered by dry (unseasoned, I think) chicken.  My husband's burger was a bit better, but I still found it less flavorful than advertised, although it was more well-cooked than my chicken.  The fries, on the other hand, were great - lush sweet potato fries, and spicy-salty seasoned regular fries.  I'd come back for drinks and bar snacks, but I've had far better burgers elsewhere.  Sadly I can't really recommend them, though they're supposed to be the specialty!  But if you sat me down with a beer and a plate of haggis bonbons, we'd be in business!",

Given the reviews on Yelp, I wanted to love this place - I tried to I really did - but ultimately found The Holyrood 9A lacking.  My first impression was of the lighting and space. It's lacking the charming gastropub feel because the lights are too bright, the furniture too shabby, and the space too wide-open and cold. We felt at times like cattle in the yard, which was ironic, because that's exactly what we were here to eat.  When we arrived, it was busy, but far from slammed. We were directed to a table that unclean and sticky. It took a good ten minutes to get someone's attention to place our order. Again, they weren't that busy, just chaotically running around. It took quite a while for our beers and food to show.  So, to while away the time, we tried our hand at the stack of games nearby. What seemed charming at first, quickly lost it's allure as the games were all broken, missing pieces, and - unsurprisingly - sticky from spilled beer. Why bother even having them anymore? Either pitch them or spend $100 for new ones.  The burger was decent. Much better than middle of the road, but far from stellar. It fell apart easily, but was otherwise palatable.  Gourmet burger places are a dime a dozen these days. Seek your meat patties in greener pastures.",

The ambiance, look and layout of the bar are a perfect combination of pub and Prohibition speakeasy. The menu is probably the most extensive list of burgers and beers I've ever seen. The burger presentation is top-notch.  So what could possibly be amiss? Sadly, the most important thing. Although they say they cook everything to medium by default, my order of medium rare came to me grey as a direwolf's coat. To further complicate matters, the sourdough bun was toasted to the point it would snap in half if flexed.  Now, it's a testament to the quality of the ingredients involved that despite these flaws, this was still one SERIOUSLY TASTY BURGER. Almost perfect. If it had been medium rare and the bun soft, I may have lapsed into a burger coma and died happily right on the spot.  The draught beer I enjoyed with my burger - Caesar Augustus - was billed as a blend of lager and IPA and could not have been a more brilliant burger compliment.",

The mustard mayo sauce on the burger was a perfect addition and I couldn't resist dipping my fries in it, as well! Hands down the best part was the extensive beer menu. It was tough to choose, so the waitress (who seemed very knowledgeable in the different types and flavors) asked me a few questions about what I liked and then offered tastes of the different beers on tap so I could find something I really could down a pint of! Overall a great dining experience - the staff was super friendly - and amazing food!",

I've eaten here before, a couple of times now, and aside from a few bug-bears of mine (they serve your food on a wooden board, and please, for the love of potatoes, STOP PUTTING FRIES IN LITTLE BASKETS!!*) the food has been consistently good.  Beers first though, and they have an excellent range, with knowledgeable staff ready to help if you want something 'not too hoppy'.   Food-wise the menu is dominated by the burgers but there are salads and a few other options, mind you the burger list is nicely varied and whilst the patty isn't the best, the clever toppings more than make up for that.  I opted for a simple cheesburger. Served in a brioche bun, with a nice rich garlic mayo and thick wedge of cheddar cheese, it was good. The patty a little overcooked for my liking, and subsequently a little dry, but well seasoned and their choice of cheese brought a nice strong flavour.  The fries were good too, despite being served in a little tub...  Add in friendly staff, and reasonable prices, and this is the kind of dependable place I'd happily return to. I'm sure there is better pub grub to be found in Edinburgh but this place has to be in the Top 5.  * There are variations on this theme, tiny baskets, or some form of cylindrical receptacle. Regardless, it means the fries/chips at the top get all the vinegar and salt. JUST GIES A BOWL!",

They have made a few changes in their burgers (on the bun, the size of the burger and that they no longer serve it with coleslaw) but still their taste and quality is great! I was more that happy to find they serve food at 11pm for the late comers (for Edinburgh this is a big deal since everything closes or stops serving food relatively early). Well done Holyrood! *Please bring back the pita breads with humus on the starter's menu! :) + and the draught Innis and Gun!",

Now, if you've eaten at Red Squirrel or the Southern (which I have), you'll know what to expect - a whole load of burgers. And they're good. You've got the option of seasoned and/or sweet potato fries, and I assume that like at RS you can swap out the bun for another burger (for a small charge) if you're gluten free.  All three pubs are some of the best for beers in Edinburgh, with an excellent tap selection and loads of bottles. Definitely worth having a look.  Service wise, it fell down a bit here as we had to flag down the waitress to order \"Oh, you're ready?\", well, yes, it had been fifteen minutes since she'd given us the menu and like I said there's only burgers on it so we didn't need that long to choose... We had a similar experience when trying to pay. To be fair to them, it was busy.  On the whole, I like Holyrood 9A and its sister pubs, and for its location it's definitely one of the better options in the area.",

Perhaps I'm a craft beer snob, but hey, if I'm drinking beer it needs to 1. taste good and 2. have a high alcohol percent.   They have light and dark beers, hoppy and not so hoppy. Whatever you want, they got. I recommend asking for a flight of beers first so you can determine which are your favorites.   All I can say is I wish we had the Holyrood 9A in Glasgow.",

It also well located between Edinburgh Castle and Holyrood Palace, so it's a great place to stop on the way down the hill.  We had burgers, the Venison and the Halimmi, and side salads instead of fries. Two beers and the food came to 25.25, more reasonable than in London pubs.  The Chieftain IPA was phenomenal! Be sure to ask questions about the rotating beer selection .  It's a young crowd at mid-day, maybe because of the huge selection of craft beers, and the music is at a level that allows for conversation.",

    "text": "I finally took myself along to Game Dev Edinburgh this week after attempting to for months. Every second tuesday game developers meet up and chat games and other things, check it out.  Anyway, this place is just round the corner from my work so i had a chunk of time to kill before the meet up happened.  The bar is dominated by a pretty huge mirrored spirits section. They've got all sorts, and most of it is pretty decent stock rather than tons of the usual smirnoff keech. I got blethering with the bar manager about various booze types and I may have committed myself to trying various silly things in the future.  as well as many spirits there are many beers of craft variety. i think about 12-15 different taps plus numerous bottles (although a fairly shocking cider selection.) I overheard the aforementioned bar manager talking about various drinks in great detail so i took the opportunity to quiz her about what was on offer and what might suit my tastes. I suspect she might have been trying to get me tanked as she kept suggesting stronger and stronger beers (8% beer on a work night?!?! eesh...) They were however all very tasty and she presented me with tasting testers without prompting which pleases me deeply. So much nicer than the glare you get from bar staff. How dare i want to check i like the taste of something before i buy a pint of it indeed. I digress.  I had a burger (naturally) and it was damn tasty. Beer mustard, hop rolled cheese, fresh crunchy salad, and a decent slab of minced beef. winner. The piri piri chips were nothing special but crunchy and salty so by no means bad. Perhaps the chunky variety are better?  I didnt order a pudding myself but someone at gamedeved did and it was gargantuan. Like bigger than the head of the girl who bought it. I was offered a sample and the ice cream, sauce, and crunch combo i taste was certainly very tasty.  This place is always rammed at weekends but was pretty quiet on the tuesday I went.  I'm sure i'll go back again!",

It took the waitress a good 45 minutes to bring the order. The burgers sere not hot and she did not bring the fries until a few minutes later. There was no dressing or lemon on the side for the salad. We also did not have any ketchup for the fries. When we asked her about the missing items she returned after a good 5 minutes with two small containers which both held something like mustard mayo and no ketchup. Later when She asked me how the service was , I complained about the deficiencies . Her response was: \" I am sorry you feel that way!\" By the way my diet coke was flat. Bottom line is that I will never ever return to this place.",

Helpful, friendly staff who actually appear to want to be there are always willing to guide you through a few tasters, steering you towards that tipple of choice. Beers are the focus in here, however there are still a wide range of your usual wine and spirit suspects. Regular rotation means that there is pretty much always something new alongside the usuals.  Food wise, 9A is known for its focus on an fairly extensive burger range, which all in all is fair considering the price and portions, however it can sometimes be a little lucky dip if you get that bap to write home about or not...!  If you are planning to eat in, especially on a weekend I suggest calling ahead, if however looking for somewhere to drop in for a pint try not to pass this place up. Capacity and atmosphere can fluctuate between only one there to elbow to elbow, just depends on the night.",

Let me just say, a 9% stout at noon is a great way to start your day after a long night out on the town. I also want to give a shout-out to the barman I interacted with. He clearly had a lot of passion for craft brewing and was quick to offer suggestions and eager to discuss whether you liked a beer or not.   However, I found that the food at Holyrood 9A was just... mediocre. I felt that the flavors weren't really there. Everything was hot, and their food is fresh and locally sourced which is all a big plus, but I felt that my meal lacked a certain something. Nothing really popped, unfortunately. I would go back for the beer, but I might skip the food next time.",

Same quality & same quantity...a little bit too sweet though (p.s. I found most of the dessert in UK too sweet except for scones).

No biggie but I felt the mistake was on the servers part so that cost 1 star. Otherwise, the beers are good and selection of beers is also good.  They do have a nice food menu so good choices all around.  The bar area was too crowded to sit at or near the bar and, like last time, we were relegated to a dinner table, which was a bit cramped of an area.  I'd like to try to find a time to come in where I can sit at the bar but that never seems to happen in all of the visits here so far.  Like I said, beer selection was good and would put this on your list for a future visit. Oh, forgot, the men's bathroom is funny. When you open one door your inclination is walk forward, which is a wall but you might think it's another door but the bathroom door is actually to the right.  Enough people make this mistake that they have an arrow painted on the wall but we still want to walk forward.  You'll see what I mean :)",

I overheard the table next to me asking for a Guinness.  \"No, we don't have that but we have some really good Scottish Ales.\"  I got the Blonde Ale on draft (Fyne Ales Jarl).  It was light, crisp and slightly hoppy.  Ordered the Haggis Bon Bons & they were pretty good and the best part of my meal.  Decided to try a burger given the reviews and settled on the Stinger with hot sauce on the side.  The taste of the burger was ok.  I was expecting a distinct taste as it is locally sourced beef/brisket.  Seemed like it needed more seasoning.  The Jalapeno Sausage was tasty & would've helped but there was hardly any on top of the burger-maybe this was the enhancement that was missing.  Also, this looks like a local requirement, the temperature had to be medium well to well-done.    They are pet friendly.  Close to the end of my meal at least 6 dogs came in & things got a bit more lively.  Service was mixed.  Some (greeter) were great and they weren't busy and there were longer gaps than necessary between courses & my server seemed like she was in a blase mood.    The restaurant had a nice Pub feel & looks like the bar would have a great vibe in the evenings.  Maybe I caught them during a Sunday afternoon lull.",

They have a big couch area in the room in the back that was really cozy.   We loved our food and beer! They have lots of craft beers and a good diverse selection, I ordered the grapefruit wire and bf ordered the volcano ipa.   The burgers come with (!!) fries, I opted for normal while my bf had the sweet potato, if you like sweet potato opt for them they're really crispy and fresh!   I ordered the hipster burger and loved it! Not just because I'm a hipster, but because it had arugula and some melty smoky sauce that tied it all together. My bf's BBQ burger was exactly that, tasted like a mix of charcoal smoked meats and sauces with crisp red onions.   The service was very fast, we were out within an hour, and they were super attentive and friendly!",

Wish I could give this dish a 6/5. Wish I could rewind my life clock and have it presented to me hot off the press again. A must try at the Holyrood.   **edit: AND THE CHIPS! Great with the seasoning in the table and some salt. Super enjoyable experience overall.",

Unfortunately, better burger joints from London and other independent ones have come to claim the title from them.  So now, unless you are here for the beer, the food seems a bit substandard.  The beer selection is good with guest ales from time to time.  However, the place can be a bit crowded and gets really hot on a Friday night.",

The street may be quiet but the bar is almost guaranteed to be buzzing with people enjoying an ale or two and tucking to their excellent pub menu or homemade desserts. Definitely leave room for dessert! They have 4 burger options for vegetarians which is a bonus. It would only take a few tweaks for some of those to become vegan. Great pub and proper hidden gem.

In the end it doesn't matter how you classify a venue it's about the food right?  Being fortunate enough to work nearby I have been here a couple of times and not only are they consistent in service it's consistently good food, doesn't get much more complex than that!  The surroundings are casual, comfortable, relaxed pub atmosphere.  Staff are prompt, friendly and service is quick.  Now the good part.  I have witnessed every burger on the menu but personally am a sucker for blue cheese on a burger so have not made it past their black and blue burger. Simply delicious, once you pick it up and take that first bite you won't put it down again. Good quality ingredients, not too greasy and the accompanying fries aren't bad either!  Personally I dread the day I change job and don't make it back here but you never know there might be somewhere better but it won't be the same. Definitely worth a look!",

    "text": "Whoa now... how the heck did I manage to miss writing a review for Holyrood 9A or as I so loving dub it: my super-happy-beer-spot-of-sunshine-and-wicked-burgers-slash-unicorn-of-a-bar? (I don't actually call it that, because that would be ridiculous but it's going to sum up the remainder of this review, so go with it.)  Any ol' spot can do beer + burgers. It's a classic for a reason and folks, let's be honest: it's a hard combo to really mess up, so to grab five stars on beer and burgers alone, you have to be throwing down some serious goodness. Here are five reasons Holyrood is worth these five stars:  1. One of the best craft beer line ups in town... ON TAP. You can bring in bottles of beer from every which way but you know a place is truly tipping their hat to craft beer culture when they are supporting a WALL of draft.  2. The Blue Murder burger: 6oz beef patty, flat cap mushroom, smoked bacon, blue murder cheese, quince aioli... a giant, messy, completely decadent way to eat a week's worth of calories in one sitting. Bonus points for the fact that this was suggested to me. Being of short and female stature, I generally get pointed in the direction of salads, so it was really refreshing to not only have a BEAST of a burger recommendation but getting said recommendation from another gal.  3. Which brings me to: the service. Table service is quick, bar service is friendly... I can't say a bad thing about it.  4. WIFI!! GOOD WIFI!! FREE WIFI!! (I rest my case).  5. Their fascinating dedication to those candles on the mantle of the fireplace. That is YEARS worth of patience and/or laziness and I salute it.  The only gripe: your bathroom is too tiny and if there is more than one person in it, you will ultimately get hit by a door. Plus, the door into the bathroom is awkwardly tiny...  But other than a brief eyebrow raise at a bathroom layout: I adore this place. It's not fancy, it's not pretentious: it's pub grub taken to a delightful level and I never regret popping my head in the door.",

I'd go for that if you're after something rich and filling. A very generous portion of Sweet potato fries cooked perfectly!

A good variety of ales from around the world on offer, and these regularly rotate so there's usually a new choice for the changing season and palate. Have eaten there a few times now and the food is far superior to the usual pub grub. Hats off to the chefs, they do a good job  I had a gorgeous halloumi burger which came with a large side of chips and extras. Friendly staff and tasty food and drink mean I'll keep returning. However, be aware that this is a popular post-work place for many and it does get very crowded after 5pm.  Book a table for food too, especially if you plan visiting on a Friday/Weekend",

And the beers had food pairings listed, which I thought was a nice touch. The proper combination of beer and food is often underappreciated. Anyway, so the beers were great, as was the food.

The pub is a little bit of everything - dark corners in the back, continental  little coffee tables at the front and a lengthy bar you prop yourself up at.  While seats can be in short supply at times, it doesn't take long for some to free up and the pub itself is well located - not too far from the train station and spitting distance from both the grassmarket/cowgate and royal mile.  Definitely worth popping in, either for a quick coffee or a few pints - it'll be time well spent",

    "text": "With a boastful slogan of 'Great beers- Great burgers' The Holyrood 9A asks for some scrutiny from its customers. True enough its customers will spend all day scrutinising its impressively large selection of beers on tap and its utterly scrumptious burgers resulting in a top class evaluation.  Rather than offering a vast menu of varied but average dishes, The Holyrood 9A aims to nail the simple combination of beer and burgers, and damn does that equate to a tasty ideology.   OK, the pints are a little on the pricey side 3-4. But don't allow that to deter you from what's on offer.  Beers such as Birra Moretti (a clean, crisp and easy drinking Italian malt beer, an alternative to Peroni) or even Brewdog's Zeitgeist (a dark, sharp tasting beer...almost better than Guiness?) will keep your wallet out and your mouth salivating. There's even a Belgian raspberry beer (namely Bacchus Framboise) a class above any of the cheap fruity beers you'd find elsewhere.  Next the Burgers: these pack a solid punch. Aside from the usual beef and chicken varieties, all of which are assured to satisfy, I tried the spiced lamb burger.  The chilli and cumin flavours were super tasty and the presentation alone will have you wondering why the usual slap dash formulae ever prevailed in other establishments.  Free Wifi and pleasant interior add the package too. You'd be hard-pressed to criticise its slogan that's for sure.",

    "text": "I love this pub! Was really lucky to stumble across it one day and from the outside I wasn't quite sure what it was going to be like but when we went in we were not disappointed! It's a lovely, clean, cosy bar with different areas and in the winter when the fire is on in the back you don't want to leave! It's a great place to go whether you're with a group of friends or just as a couple. There's a great selection of ales, lagers, spirits and wines and they often introduce new beers to give us regulars a chance to try something new. If you like burgers you will be in heaven! There's a great choice and they are delicious and so are the fries they come with. I've heard their breakfasts are also very good too. The staff are all really nice and friendly. It can be busy on a Friday and Saturday night so if you planning going for food I would definitely recommend booking a table.",

Good atmosphere- busy, but not so much so that its uncomfortable or too loud. Staff are very friendly and attentive.   The menu offers a range of inventive gourmet burgers (i usually have the chilli burger), as well as salads and sides. The burgers are generous in size and presented nicely, on wooden boards with a pot of coleslaw and string fries. Deserts are lovely too- try the toffee sundae!   Good range of drinks, including many beer choices and cocktails for under a fiver. Wine is listed under \"cheap\", \"good\" and \"great\" - meaning there is various price ranges.   Would definitely recommend a visit :)h",

We ordered two Pioneer burgers and they were absolutely awesome. From the menu: 6oz burger, sauteed rosemary scented wild mushrooms, crispy   bacon, Swiss cheese & Garlic mayo. Awesome! The garlic mayo is to die for, my chips were crunchy (just how I like them) and the burger was the perfect size and also cooked perfectly. Definitely going back!",

Perfection balanced in the bread, the meat and the toppings and my personal favourite, skinny chips. They also have some incredibly tempting veg options. Yum!  After two more visits I'd say an upgrade is in order. These burgers have now become a craving as well as a sanity staple. I'm in love and I'm not ashamed to say it.",

    "text": "It's a good sign that when you walk into a bar for some food that the menu is reassuringly focused. Pick a food genre, stick with it, and do it well. Pretty simple really.  I think I can be forgiven for developing the habit of wandering round to Holyrood 9a for a burger and a pint.  One of the cosier pubs in Edinburgh's city centre, if you're feeling remotely fragile from the night before you can squirrel yourself away into a dark corner and expedite your recovery with one of the fantastic burgers.  I'll have you check my notes, but I think now had every burger on the menu, and I'm fairly sure that it's not a fabricated memory borne out of over-familiarity with the range.  This time I went for the lamb burger. I do have a soft spot for lamb, so if anything I'm going to be particularly critical. Seasoned with cumin and dressed with a fiery sauce that's tempered by the yoghurt and cucumber dressing it feels a wee bit like a merging of the Mediterranean and North African cuisine all neatly contained in floury bun.  When it comes to you on a plank of wood with some seriously heavy duty looking coleslaw it doesn't look like much, but you'll be surprised at how filling the portions are. You might also be thankful that it comes with skinny fries rather than the increasingly typical \"fresh cut\" chips that are so chunky they could derail a train; they have their place, it's just not here.  It'll set you back about seven quid for their basic burger, which is maybe a bit more than you'd typically expect from a pub burger but I assure you it's money well spent.  My weekend lunch time visits started as an outing of convenience (living literally a 4 minute walk away made it a no-brainer), but now it's an excursion of love.  That walk is closer to half-an-hour, but it's a trip totally worth making.",

    "text": "As a Midwestern American foodie my standard for what constitutes a good burger are exacting and thorough. Holyrood 9A did not disappoint. Having what is arguably the best burger in Edinburgh. First and foremost, the selection of available meats and toppings far exceeded any of my wildest dreams and were truly splendid. My favorite was the venison burger, which was lean, had the right heft and bite, and was gamey but not over powering. The fries were phenomenal and and the bun didn't dissolve, but instead holds it might!  Second of all, the beer selection is quite outstanding. While it might not be as prolific as some places I visited, it's quality is nonetheless pretty outstanding. The flat cider they had on tap when I went was mind-blowing.   Third off, the dark, quartered feel of the gastropub perfectly matches with the food and provides an excellent atmosphere.  The only complaint I have that hold me back from giving them a 5/5 is the size of the pub section in relation to the restaurant part can mean that things get a bit cozier than one would like when dining.   However, I would definitely not only recommend going, but plan on going back whence I visit Edinburgh again in the near future.",

    "text": "I went to this bar/pub knowing absolutely nothing about it at all. I'm not from The Edinburgh so I'm not familiar with many of the bars/pubs there.  Stumbled across this place when through for the festival this year to see Tim Vine (who was very funny btw). We left quite early for Edinburgh so by the time our show had finished we were well ready for eats.   This place clearly specialises in Beer and Burgers - 2 things I like rather a lot. From what I gather this is a fairly new bar but it has already been nominated for the DRAM Awards Best New Bar. S'nice.   Myself and my boy quickly got a table - it was messy when we sat down but with it being the Festival season and just past the lunch rush we excused this. We helped ourselves to menus and in the meantime our table was quickly cleaned and cleared anyway and the polite waitress then asked us if we would like any drinks. This is a bit of a bug-bear of mine - you've only JUST sat down/looked at the menu and straight away you're asked what drink you would like. This would be FINE if I was a predictable drinker (have the same drink everywhere) but I am not; I like to try new things and everyday, depending on how I feel, it depends on what I drink. This day I was very thirsty and therefore very glad to see the extensive draught beer menu - at least 19 beers I spotted! Wowzer! Because I was rushed I picked a beer that wouldn't have been my 1st choice had I been given more time to look. Oof. ANYWAY, I digress - I chose a pint of West St.Mungo lager (had it before, really like it) Now I don't know if I imagined this but I swore I seen Brooklyn Lager on the menu after I had already ordered and I do *love* a pint of Brooklyn so I was kicking myself that I had felt rushed into ordering. Dang.   Service was swift - the waitress that brought our drinks also then took our food order. This place specialises in quality burgers of all kinds. But fear not my vegetable loving friends! They DO cater for the veggies - with 4 types of veggie burgers on their menu amongst other non-animal dishes too. Also on their menu was tasty sounding breakfasts (only served til 12 Noon though...not very good for us late risers), various salads (who orders a salad when there's burgers on the menu?!) and other types of meaty sarnies.   I opted for the (unadventurous) Cheese Burger and my boy ordered the Cheese and Bacon Burger. Both arrived swiftly and made my eyes go 'BOOOIIIINNNGGG!' like in the cartoons of old. Our HUGE burgers came on a wooden slab to make us feel even more Paleolithic-like (Ug!) and served alongside were lovely skinny crisp fries and a wee bowl of fancy coleslaw. Also in the burger was a delicious beer mustard mayo and the usual dill pickle, lettuce and tomato. I had to halve my BEAST BURGER coz being a dainty fingered lady (Ha ha) I could not handle that cow sandwich all in one go.   All was very tasty and along with the beer I was one very satisfied lady indeed. After eating I thought in my wee head wouldn't it be grand to have a bar like this in Glasgow. There most probably is one but I've not came across it yet.   Only downside was the teeny-tiny ladies toilets. Made me feel like a giant and when a place serves such good burgers they cannot expect all their lady patrons to be the size of Victoria Beckham. Boo and hoo.   I would most definitely go back to The Holyrood 9A and next time try another good beer and another mammoth burger (not *actually* made with mammoth).",

But there isn't much reason to go down Holyrood road other than to get to St Leonard's Land Gym or a detour to the Parliament. This is unfortunate as The Holyrood 9A is a great wee pub.  Actually it isn't that wee, it's much bigger on the inside than you would first think. Its interior is cosy, traditional but with a revamped, fresh twist which isn't altogether stunning but nice all the same. They have a great selection of beers. But the main selling point as everyone who goes there knows, is the burgers. I get pretty annoyed when all I get when I order a burger is some slab slapped between some dry buns and a wee side salad. But here the burgers are much more impressive and there are is a greater and far more creative selection than your typical bar meal. This includes a veggie option!  A nice pub with a good selection of burgers and beer that make for a great afternoon/evening visit.",

This saddens me a little..... seriously, like employ me!!!

    "text": "I recently purchased an Itison deal which gave us two burgers and two drinks for 12 (instead of 26ish).  We decided to arrive a bit early and get in a few drinks, and our evening unfolded...  Everyone working was wearing some type of hat.  What's with the hats?  Was it a one-off or is it a normal Friday night thing?  It was easy to see that many of the staff were uncomfortable.   Despite being uncomfortable, they all provided *exceptionally* good service.  I was really impressed with the bar tender who came and found us when our table was ready, especially considering it was definitely not her job.   Tiny points off to the same bartender who recommended a beer to me that was something ridiculous like 5/pint due to a higher alcohol percentage.  I wasn't aware of either the price or the abv until it was too late.    The burgers were well received in beer-ful and otherwise empty bellies, though again the patty itself needs a bit of something to give it more flavour.  It was also taller than it was wide (if that makes any sense) so I struggled to take each bite, but ran out of meat before I ran out of bun.    So in all, next time I'd like to try a different type of burger and definitely recommend coming here on a lazy Sunday afternoon.  Friday night was fun, but it gets a bit busy and not too conducive to a relaxing meal.",

With about 20 different varieties of burger on their menu you're sure to find something for everyone.  Whether it be a good old traditional cheese burger; falafel, haloumi or mushroom burgers for all you veggies out there or something different such as haggis, venison, lamb, pork and turkey for you adventurous folk.    Trust me, these are tasty burgers!!!  Top tip - the piri piri chips are not to be missed!!!    Now to the more important business - beer!  9A offers a wide variety of beers from all corners of the globe.  One little treasure which was recently found is Little Creatures beer from Fremantle, Perth to bring back memories of your travelling days around Oz - or for those yet to make it to the land down under then experience one of its many pleasures right here in Bonnie Scotland!!!    On a Friday night this place gets rammed with people from the nearby offices so probably best to avoid it until they stumble home usually by 9pm.",

I have been lead to believe they are the purveyors of some of the finest man food in town and I was not disappointed.  To start with we were welcomed by a very attractive waitress (always a good start lets be honest) and decided to have a milkshake while we contemplated the real decision.  After 10 minutes I just could not decided...... bohemia burger, piri-piri chicken burger..... halloumi burger.......lamb burger.....damn too many choice..  Then I saw it.......steak sandwich with beer mustard and portabello muschroom. So I ordered and was asked a question that brought a smile to my face \"how would you like your steak cooked?\".......YYYAAASSSSS!!! Rare please..... :D HAPPY JD!!!!!  When it arrived on it wooden board it delivered........beautiful tender rare steak...well seasoned with nice chips in a small bucket and some good mayo!!  It is as good as they say.....now i have to go back and try a burger....or a skeweer...or a salad. Hmmm seems I may be going back a few times!!",

Chilli B's, lamb B's, veggie falaffel B's - there is a B for everyone!  I oped for the guacomole burger and holy moley, it was dynamite. Served up on a slab with skinny chips and swanky relish, you're spoiled.  Quite a personal dining experience, the chef takes pride in his food as much as the owner has invented a quote-tastic, slammin' menu. Their effort shows, and I'm sold.  Incidently, this burger only lost out to a burger I had in New York which was, I kid you not, the size of my FACE. But y'know, this burger was not far off!",

    "text": "Before the 9A was tagged on to the end of this place, The Hollyrood was a dingy little bar that was a favorite of Edinburgh's goth contingent.  Thankfully, it closed and then opened again as The Holyrood 9A and is now one of the best pubs in Edinburgh!  I am guessing they set out with \"burgers and beer... done properly!\" in mind, and thats exactly what it is.  Apart from a few starter options, the bulk of the menu is simply a stunning range of burgers.  Beef, chicken, mushroom and halloumi - all with a massive range of high quality toppings.  Being a massive fan of a good burger, I cant say they are the best I have ever had, but they are definitely up there.     The actual bar is great, a good mix or modern and traditional and doesn't feel like they are trying to hard.  The bar is well stocked, with a brilliant range of beers, ales and lagers on tap that changes quite often too.  They have a a great range of malts too, as well as rums, bourbons and pretty much anything else you could want!  The staff are friendly, efficient and very knowledgeable too.  if you are looking for a beer, a burger, or both I would highly recommend a trip to the 9A and would be very surprised if you craving wasn't satisfied!",
