This one is in the arcade walkway down off the South Bridge that's not too noticeable if you don't know it exists there.   Oddly, on the Saturday night, they had a shortage of rice! Aside from that slight disappointment, food was overall good quality and quite enjoyable.",

    "text": "As I understand it, Kampung Ali has a couple of locations.  WE stumbled upon this one in the North Bridge Arcade.  So you have to pop off the street to find it.  My DC has a \"thing\" for laksa so anytime we come across a place with Laksa we have to go!  So she had their laksa, which was very nice.  The rice noodles were of the wide type rather than vermachelii.  But the this is one of the dishes that everyone's grandmother does different, so just go with the flow and see if it is spicy enough to make your nose run.  This one seemed to have very little shrimp paste, but it was still very good.  the squid was not over cooked, which can be a rare treat.  I had the roti with beef randang.  It too has a nice spice and very tender.  A bit different than the randang I've had before, but again everyone's grandmother type of dish.  The roti were hot off the plancha and supper flaky.  Perfect for scooping up the beef.  A little small on the portion size for the price, but very tasty.  Some tiger beer and the tarik rounded up a very nice dinner.    Service was friendly and sweet.",
