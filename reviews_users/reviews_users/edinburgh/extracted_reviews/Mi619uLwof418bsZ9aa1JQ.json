Our party of four received a friendly welcome on arrival and after settling in we ordered some drinks and food.  Their menu is not extensive, which I think is a good thing. They do have all the basics: starters, side dishes, ribs & chicken, couple of seafood options, specials and just steaks. I had a fillet steak with bearnaise sauce from the specials menu, and it came with French fries. The steak was cooked to my liking (medium rare) and the accompanying fries were the best I've had for ages. Crispy on the outside and fluffy and soft on inside. They were superb. Sometimes restaurants make a big deal of their 'triple-cooked chips' or whatever and they don't always deliver. Rancho on the other hand delivered big time without making a fuss.  The red wine we had (I believe it was Carmenere) was really good value (19.95 for bottle) and it went well with steaks.   The dessert menu had the classics: dame blanche, banana split etc.   Good tasty food, recommended.",

    "text": "Nice experience of Argentinan steaks to have here in Edinburgh! I must confess I am not much of a steak person and can be quite picky when it comes to steak houses. Anyway, this little place is a delight.  It's located very close to Haymarket station and easily accessible by bus. The outside is painted red and I believe they are quite new. Their wooden floor is very polished and you could slide up and down just for fun :-)  Everything is very clean. The staff was very attentive and polite. Always making sure we had everything and all was perfect. There were a few hiccups from either side, but easily forgiven, like me spilling some irun bru or a cork that was a bit resilient :-)  The food that you get is worth the price you pay and for a steakhouse their prices are quite reasonable.  We had ordered a red wine, which was one of the best I ever had. Valdemoro! I think it's called. Sadly their coffee machine had stopped working and their tea choice does not include peppermint , but still , next time I go there just for their amazing desserts (mostly ice cream) or liquor coffees. I had a peppermint steak with pepper sauce, medium rare and one of the best chips here in Edinburgh. These chips are seriously crispy and thin sliced.  There are various other sauces you can choose from and the steak selections are quite good. The menu ranges from Rumpsteak to Sirloin steak to Ribeye in different sizes or even combinations of various steak choices.  The tables are quite small and fit four people quite ok, although I believe that they are made for 2. They can also accommodate for a bigger group.  It's well worth a visit!!!",

    "text": "Really good service and a wonderful alternative to the 'Scottish' steakhouse. They have reasonable prices and quite the choice of steaks. You can mix and match from the menu. I created my personal favourite, T-Bone King Prawn surf and turf. btw, the fries are actually well prepared, amazing how such a detail can make or break a meal. Will go back.",
