    "text": "The external decor of this place really gives me the creeps! There's a picture of an archetypal 1950s woman leering over her husband at you - wtf?!  Once you get inside it's clear that they're going for the homely feel, but the tongue-in-cheek manner of it just gives me the shivers for some reason. The food, however, is amazing with all the classic British staples like steak pie, fish of the day with chips, haggis and roast chicken.  It's all priced as you would expect with most mains costing about 8 and it all looks and tastes great.  I had their chicken pie which was served in a filling portion, and certainly gave me value for money with plenty of tender chunks of chicken and vegetables in a delicious gravy. I definitely recommend this place for great food and quick service.",

    "text": "Oh how I love Monster Mash! It serves the most amazing British comfort food with a slight 70's feel to it.   Situated just around the corner from the main University campus, George Square, Monster Mash is super popular with all the students at lunch and dinner time so it can be difficult to get a seat.   The menu offers a mouth watering selection of British classic meals which completely do the trick when you are cold and hungry and walking around Edinburgh on a miserable day. Monster Mash's menu includes dishes such as haggis, fish and chips, Shepard's pie, steak pie, and my absolute favourite, roast chicken with ALL the trimmings - yum!  They also serve a really gorgeous pasta dish with a tomato and onion sauce which never fails to impress.   Monster Mash also serve breakfast meals including a full fry up, eggs Benedict and really tasty breakfast rolls which just cost 1.50 - what a bargain! Mt friend absolutely loves their coke floats (coke with ice cream) and I can't seem to get enough of their strawberry milkshakes - they are just so yummy.   I cannot recommend Monster Mash any higher, I love it!",

And the best part of course, is that the food is fantastic and the lunches (5 pounds) are such a good deal!   The lunch comes with a soup and a main. I had the macaroni and cheese, with the tomato soup. It was filling, and delicious comfort food. I also had the genius to get the milkshake marked as \"AMAZING\" on the menu, the gingerbread. Seriously it was amazing. If you go to Mums, you should check out this milkshake.   My more daring friend decided to try the meat Haggis, and though it was scary, it ended up being delicious (sort of like.. more flavorful ground beef) so if you want to try it in a less intimidating environment, I recommend Mums!   As someone who came to the UK fearing high prices, Mums is definitely a pleasant (and delicious) experience.",

    "text": "It's hard to review this place without getting hungry all over again... It certainly fulfills its description of itself as a 'British retro cafe', but its not retro in the sense of musty and weird, it's retro in the sense of it's that amazing it will honestly never ever go out of fashion.  They do have some none bangers-and-mash based things on their menu, like fish & chips or haggis, neeps & tatties, but for the most part the idea is pretty simple: You choose what type of sausage you want, how many sausages you want, and what flavour mash you want. If you're feeling healthy you can opt for a portion of veg one the side, but that'll cost you extra.  Speaking of prices, at first when my flatmate and I saw the menu we thought it was a bit steep - surely it shouldn't cost 6.95 for one single sausage and a dollop of mash?! But then the food arrived and we'd felt bad for ever thinking anything bad about this place...  The sausages were huge, for one thing. In fact, my flatmate couldn't even finish hers. My personal favourite would have to be the smoked pork and bacon one, but if it that doesn't appeal to you there were about 30 different types to choose from. The cajun mash was definitely a good choice too (although there was easily enough of it to feed 3 of me!), it wasn't too spicy but the waiter's description of it having \"just a nice bit of heat\" was spot on. For gravy I went for the garlic and herb one - call me boring but I didn't really know what was best to go with the range of flavours already on my plate!  If you are feeling ridiculously hungry, you can upgrade to 2 sausages and mash for 8.95, but I think I'll stik to trying to just finish the one first. If you're indecisive, don't worry. The staff were so patient and helpful, presumably because they're used to people taking ages to make their minds up from all the millions of combinations available.  It's fresh, it's filling, it's tasty and it's great value for money. If you've not been there already you should be ashamed of yourself.",

After mustering up the courage to try it for myself, I was comforted to know that the MUM's recipe I was served contained nothing but ground veggies, bean bits and barley parts, piled high on top of parsnip and carrot mash. (I did order the meaty Haggis, but wasn't going to send this tower of yum back to the kitchen.) The onion gravy was flavorful and the pumpkin-leek-potato soup served with sundried tomato bread was also yummy after I doused it in salt.   It's a 5 Pounds Sterling Lunch Special that's worth every pence. And the Irn Brew was like drinking liquid bubble gum. Yes, I felt about seven again with this Happy Meal. In fact, I even got a fruity chew with the tab, which was much better than some lead-based Chinese toy doomed to break after unwrapping it from the cellophane.  Next time, if I ever go back to Edinburgh, I'll order the Traditional Haggis in True Scottish fashion--in a skirt and no underwear or in underwear and no skirt, whichever one's more comfortable.",

I received a small plate that was half \"hand cut\" chips and the other half was a pathetic bit of Iceberg lettuce with one slice of tomato, with a small tub of homemade coleslaw. The Wellington had been chucked on top of this, so as you can imagine, not the best presentation.   It took 8 or 9 mouthfuls of stodgy, salty, pastry to get to any sort of \"filling\" in the Wellington. Yes, as advertised, there was a mushroom, spinach and cheese filling, unfortunately, there was absolutely no taste to any of it. The \"hand cut\" chips, come heavily salted. So heavily, that you think they must have been salted before going into the fryer! The only thing on the plate that was halfway decent was the coleslaw.   Service was decent, when they weren't busy sprawled across the booths chatting to their mates. Tables were also far too cramped, both for getting into and the number of people expected to sit around them. Oh and you get two Fruit Salad chewy sweets with your bill.   It's fair to say that I won't be going back.",

In fact I'm sure those are the same style water jugs we had at my school back in the day.  Bangers and Mash are the order of the day here. And those snausages! OMG. Those snausages. Worth invading a small, unprepared, snausage-rich country for. But luckily they're made in the ole U of K so it's all good.  Portion was a little small. I had the two sausage and mash and I showed it who was boss in about three minutes.  The Shakes are truly awesome. And I like my milkshakes like I like my women, thick and rich.  I shall leave this review until I've had a chance to go back and try their Wagyu beef, 'cos I friggin' love Wagyu beef.  #montage to show the passing of time, pages falling off calendars, seasons changing, fade to black #  I had always lived with the belief that the cows that turn into Wagyu beef are fed on corn and beer and massaged daily.  I like the image of drunk cows saying things like \"Yessh, good masharge, thish. Hic moo mooOOOooooOOooo hic\"  Unfortunately Mums have printed a few 'home truths' about Wagyu beef on their menu and this has led to the crushing realisation that the image of drunken, massaged cows I had in my mind all these years is False. So screw you 'Mums', thanks for that.  But now I've had a Wagyu burger and OMFG it's good. Best burger ever, hands down.  They treat it with the respect it deserves. You can choose how to have it (have it rare or you are committing a crime) and it simply comes on a toasted bun, no sauce, no plastic cheese, just perfection. I'm getting all emotional thinking about it again.  I thought the chips that came with it weren't all that but then.......some of the burger juice dripped onto them and from then on they were awesome.  I want to be buried alive under an avalanche of Wagyu burgers and have to eat my way out.",

    "text": "Prior to my trip to Edinburgh, I had researched a few places to dine at that would offer vegetarian versions of typical Scottish fare. This place came up in my search and I was glad that I did since I quite enjoyed my meal here.  I came here a couple of weeks ago with an acquaintance. He had never been here either, despite having lived in Edinburgh all of his life. I had the vegetarian haggis neeps and tatties and he got the St. Giles steak and ale pie. Our food arrived promptly after we ordered and the portions were quite large. I've never had regular haggis before, so I can compare the vegetarian version to the actual version, but I will say that if regular haggis tastes like the version I had, I would probably like it. It was nicely seasoned, hearty, and just overall tasty. My dining partner quite liked his dish as well.  I like the pseudo-retro vibe that this place has and the food itself was quite good. Good value for your money. Definitely check this place out if you happen to have a quandary about where to dine in Edinburgh!",

My girlfriend and I ordered two plates of pancakes and one eggs Benedict. The pancakes were cold and had cold syrup poured over them - not to mention they were hardly fluffy and tasted as if they were made the night before. The eggs Benedict wasn't any better. The eggs hardly looked real and was coated in a sauce that is sure to upset the hardiest of stomachs. Overall if you're looking to spend the next two days running to the bathroom and a cramping stomach then this is your place. Oh, also the manager showed up 5-10 minutes after their scheduled opening time leaving a group of customers outside waiting to be let in.",

I also imagined the stodgy bland food that awaited me inside. I shuddered at the thought... How wrong was I?  6.95 and I get veggie sausages, mash and gravy. There is a choice between broccoli and tomato and basil sausages, both are homemade. I choose one of each. There is a long mash menu, offerings including Moroccan spiced, tomato and basil and cheese and onion. I opted for courgette and garlic mash. Next comes gravy-there are two veggie options alongside the traditional meat gravy: tomato and thyme and red onion. I went for the tomato and thyme.   I came with 5 friends, one of whom ordered the pumpkin and sage pie, two the haggis and the other two chose a meaty version of the bangers and mash. A couple of people also ordered milkshakes. We are all very hungry but our food took quite a long time to arrive. My food finally arrived, a generous serving of mash with two veggie sausages on top. The gravy is served separately in little pots.  All in all, a relatively cheap meal which was comforting but also a little experimental introducing exotic flavours to a traditional dish. I was impressed to see quite a number of very different veggie options in a casual restaurant serving traditional fare.",

I always get the same dish - 3 sausages with mash and gravy (completely gluten free!).  There's a huge selection of different sausages (they're all very high quality stuff) and the mash and gravy comes in a lot of different flavors too.  My favorites are the lamb and mint, the herby, and the pork and apple sausages, with the horseradish mash and the tomato and thyme gluten free gravy.  It's pretty reasonable prices - 8 pounds for the 3 sausages, mash, and gravy.  And if you're here for the festival, then it's very close to many festival locations.",

It came with home-made wedges and a side salad and I opted to top it with blue cheese. And it was goooooood.   The other half went for sausages and mash, one of the signature dishes on the menu. You can choose your sausages, mash and gravy options so it's very personalised and fun.   The banana split was lovely. The chefs had caramelised the banana and there were three different flavours of ice cream, topped with more cream and chocolate and sprinkles. Good times. The portion size was ample to share.  Atmosphere was warm and happy - lots of people out for their dinner, good tunes over the speakers and really friendly waiting staff who were always keen to help even though it was mega packed.  Lastly, a thumbs up for the loos, which had brilliant black and white murals of popular culture icons like James Bond and Mrs Peel. Win!",

Occasionally they hold a great 7 lunch deal.  I always recommend Mum's to anyone visiting Scotland or the Uk in general. This place really shows how to do good British comfort food.  The downside would be the breakfasts. They have really good breakfast but it's expensive and the portions are small. I was disappointed with the pancakes and eggs Benedict. However, their veggies is big and a not so bad deal.   Come here for lunch or dinner but maybe not for breakfast.",

It was absolutely delicious. Now as for service- the girl who was working was amazing! So perky and happy! Then when she found out I was visiting Edinburgh, she got me a map and made loads of cool suggestions about what I could do, even drawing how to get there! I did take her advice on one of the walks, as it was an unseasonably warm and sunny day for Edinburgh. A great experience from start to finish! I'll be back next time I'm in Edinburgh for sure!",

Mainly though, I come back because they only seem to employ the nicest folk on the planet. Every single time I have been in to eat, the staff have been so lovely and chill. They seem to know when you want a wee chat and a giggle or if you need left alone to ponder life and existence.   A good all rounder, family friendly down to earth place. Recommended.",

Quality retro dishes that brought back memories. Childhood favourites on the drinks list - who doesn't remember ice cream floats from their childhood. Awesome drink & dessert combo.  I had the Spanish chorizo bangers with champ mash & onion gravy. The sausages were packed with chunks of chorizo, full of flavour & meaty goodness. The mash was buttery, lump free and I liked the crunchy sweetness of the spring onions that were mixed through.   I opted for a strawberry milkshake to wash it all down. It was the stuff of childhood. Thick, creamy and satisfyingly sweet. In a proper sundae glass too.   Most of the group had bangers and mash too. One had the steak pie & declared it as good as her nan's. must be good then. Who doesn't love their nan's cooking.  It was huge too. See the pic.  Let's not forget the sweeties. The bill comes with fruit salad & blackjack chewie sweeties. We fought over the fruit salad ones as noone wanted black teeth for the afternoon meetings.   All in, a lovely meal delivering comfort as advertised. At a reasonable price. We'll definitely be back again.",

It was also so pretty I didn't want to eat it... and then, they were so good and our table devoured it. I also don't know what they put in the coffee here.

Well then, give us a bash at the bangers and mash me mother used to make\".   When you're far (or not so far!) from home, and just want something to make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside, like your mothers bangers and mash, Mums is the place you should make a beeline for!  It's fairly straightforward, pick your choice of a variety of sausages, mash and gravy...then enjoy it with a great big smile on your face! For me it was the veggie sausage, with chipotle and cheese mash (good kick to it without being over-spicy!), and caramelised onion gravy! You can have 2 (6.95) or 3 (8.95) sausages depending on how hungry you are. I plumped for 2 so I could leave room for pudding!  The puddings were equally heart-warming, with my yummy apple and berry crumble tasting just like the crumbles I used to have at home (complete with a jug of delicious custard!)  To accompany my meal I had a boozy milkshake, and was absolutely overjoyed to find they stock one of my favourite things...Tequila Rose Liqueur. It made for a delightful strawberry milkshake with a hit of tequila!   Mums also have a good selection of other comforting dishes on the menu which are well worth a look!  I had a lovely meal here, and the staff were chatty, friendly and attentive. Word of advice though, book in advance if you have your heart set on a meal full of cuddles and fuzziness. They were full up and turning people away...and it's too wonderful a place to miss out on!",

If they have Thistly Cross ginger cider, try it -- it's a cheeky dance party in your mouth!  The haggis stack is amazing and comes with delicious gravy. The sausages, although small, taste delicious and there are usually four or five varieties to choose from. Be forewarned, though, if you arrive after 1 or 2 p.m. they may have sold out of the most popular! Choose from about a billion types of mash and gravy and you're set.  I'd like to give Mum's five stars -- this review is really closer to 4.5 -- but their service can be a bit spotty at times. Staff are very friendly and nice but it's taken me fifteen minutes after seating just to get a drink order, so if you need a quick in-and-out lunch this might not be the place. Do go and linger though -- it's an adorable place and the food is so good you won't want to rush.",

The mash was lovely. The sausages were actually less yummy than I expected. My husband had a burger with fries (chips). I thought his burger was dry and not very good. The chips were just so-so. I'd avoid the burgers. But the prices here are generally reasonable and portions very filling. I'd like to come back and try more of the menu.",

    "text": "Well Mum's Great Comfort Food certainly lived up to it's name! We were instantly greeted by an unbelievably friendly member of staff full of great chat.   The menu is great, the main dishes are burgers, bangers and mash and pies. You get to choose which mash you want from a huge list such as red onion and basil, cheese and onion, leek and bacon etc.  My only advice would be don't eat for 2 days before you visit. I ordered the steak and ale pie with black pudding and apple mash and when it arrived i was shocked by the enormity of it. It really was enormous. This could be a bit off putting for some people but luckily i was starving. The pie was delicious and i couldn't fault it, but the mash was a bit disappointing. To be honest it seemed a bit more like instant mash.  Overall i loved this place. The staff are amazingly friendly and love to have a good chat with everyone, and the food is certainly very comforting! I can't wait to go back!",

The Chips are actually fresh cut vs. the frozen rubbish you get in a lot of places. For what it is, it's amazing and just as it's billed: \"Comfort Food\".

    "text": "I absolutely LOVE Mums. Comfort food all the way.  I came here first as a tourist (back when it was Monster Mash) years and years (and years and years..oh my...) ago and I won't say that it is the reason I moved here, but it's high on the list.  Bangers and Mash is an obvious favourite. The selection of custom sausages changes daily and there's a wide selection of mashes and gravies, who knew ordering bangers and mash could be so complicated!  If that's not to your taste then something on the extensive (ish) menu of good, warm, stodgy food should take your fancy.  As for your surroundings, Hong Kong Phooey on the telly and booths will summarise everything you need to know. The staff are always full of banter and are a complete joy. They'd brighten anyone's day!  To complete your meal, in lieu of mints, you'll receive a selection of Blackjacks and Fruit Salads with your very reasonable bill. There's also candy bracelets, though legend has it they're reserved for only very special customers/occasions!",

It has become my favourite start of each weekend, walking in and having a different combination of sausages of the day, accompanied with one of these delicious combinations of mash and gravy and eggs on top.   If you are in the mood for a burger or a pie you can't go wrong either - the beef is tasty as hell and the venison is also a delight. Pack these with a comfy and friendly atmosphere, waiters that don't hesitate giving you opinions about the dishes of each day and great prices and you have it; a place which is really as good as it gets.",

    "text": "So I finally made it to Mum's and I'm happy to report that it lived up to expectations.   Essentially you should know whether or not you're going to like this place from how it is advertised... it's a comfort food joint with a retro, almost diner type, edge... what you see is what you get so if the idea of a few sausages and mash doesn't do it for you then it may not be your kinda place.  (They do have some other mains, the haggis seemed a popular choice our particular day, but the sausages and mash are the primary stars.)   The good news is in the staggering amount of choice for said stars... I had a hard time trying to decide what to get, eventually going with the Mexican Hot (yum!) and a Pork, Garlic, and Thyme Sausage atop of a Mushroom and Garlic Mash with Caramelised Onion Gravy.  The Mexican Hot was excellent, definitely on my list to order again if it happens to be available... the Pork, Garlic, and Thyme Sausage was actually quite good, but probably the most like sausages I've had elsewhere... if you've ever gotten a Tesco Finest Pork & XYZ sausage, it was along those lines... no fault to them however, I really should have realised this from the name to be honest.  A friend of mine got the Beef and Guinness Sausage which was excellent and left me a smidge jealous. (Food envy is definitely a real thing!)  The mash was as described and quite good as well... I personally will work my way through another type next time, but out of curiosity as much as anything else.   The service was friendly, but just a tad slower than I would have liked... not slow enough to be called bad however, and when you were being attended to it was very personal and friendly which I adore.   The place itself works for what it is and eerily reminded me of somewhere you would find in Little Five Points, Atlanta... that's certainly not a bad thing, but it had made me wished I had dressed a bit cooler that particular day as each of the other customers pretty much looked like they could have been in a band and shamefully I was sans waistcoat this particular day.   They only have a few beers on tap, but the two choices we partook in that day were winners for us... one being the Thistly Cross Whisky Cider, which really caught the three of us off guard in how good it was, with the other being a Tempest Red Rye beer which was also extremely good, both complimenting the meals nicely.   We didn't have desserts, but what went by did look extremely good and despite not being able to have them (blasted lactose!), I really liked that they had milkshakes on the menu.   One of the best bits about this place to me is that the prices match the food... you're not going to pay an arm and a leg to eat here despite the \"cool\" factor.   As a last note for those that this applies to... they actually had several veggie sausages on offer as well, some of which seeming as adventurous in composure as their meaty counterparts, so don't be scared to stop in here with your meat hungry friends.  (Aside from that they had the compulsory Veggie Haggis as well should sausages not be your thing.)   So there you have it... good comfort food at good prices, some days you really couldn't ask for more.",

    "text": "I mourned the loss of Monster Mash on Glasgow's Byres Road, but I think I prefer Edinburgh's branch even more!  Monster Mash specialise in good old comfort food, enough to keep you warm on a cold winter's night. Priding themselves on offering traditional British grub, their simple, stodgy offerings are quite refreshing compared to the bland gloss of many restaurants nowadays. With a crackling radio humming in the background,much of the kitchen in plain view and a cosy gathering of intimate, chipped formica tables that give you the sensation you're leaning, cafe's like Monster Mash have become charming since there aren't enough of them these days.  There is an element of nostalgia as you are lovingly served up a massive pile of steaming mash and taters, and the attentive waiters are always on hand to make sure you are suitably well fed. It's very down to earth and the menu is kept short and very sweet, so you won't be bamboozled by fancy options.   It's the kind of place you can turn up in jeans to unabashedly stuff your face. In fact, the caring bunch at Monster Mash encourage you to leave your finest attire on the coat hanger, your feigned etiquette at the door, and just to come as you are. They want you to eat and be merry, making Monster Mash the best place in Edinburgh to get some of the finest rustled up scran in the city.",

The prices are on the high side for what you get. I had veggie sausage with chipotle and cheese mash. 7 quid and not a vast portion, either. I ordered drinks and they never came. Had to get up and go find my waiter who was busy sending a very important text. I think this place has a great concept and obviously good cooks in the back. Sort out the front end service and you've got a winner. The kids menu is pretty great. Will go again. My friends had the pies and these were spectacular.",

As I was looking at the menu there were so many dishes that caught my eye but then I saw the pumpkin and sage pie and I can never pass up anything with pumpkin in it. The pie itself was quite big and it also came with a side of vegetables and chips. The flavors of the pumpkin and sage went well together and neither overpowered the other. I went home stuffed as could be. This is a great place to go for some delicious comfort food and one I will definitely go to again.",

I met another Japanese tourist who travelled to so many places, living through the states and Canada - but has never had bacon and pancakes, eggs benedict, or mac n cheese (which came with chips).  I needed to fix this.   So we shared those 3 items, with 2 teas, and it came to 10 each.  I wouldn't say it's the best quality food, but to have a decent hot meal for 7-8 I'm not gonna complain!  I really wanted to try the bAngers and mash (they have 14 kinds!), but didn't have time to revisit.   Anyway, we walked away happy and full :) great spot for a tourist looking to get a good value experience for bangers n mash, pies and stews, and haggis!",

We are aching to return to try the unbelievable selection of different sausage and mash plates, burgers, and puddings. Not to mention everything is under 10 - perfect for poor Americans who spent all their savings to move here. The drinks all sounded amazing too (Irn Bru floats, for real) and went for around 3-4.  The service was excellent and our waitress was wonderful. She was funny, friendly, and so helpful. She explained things on the menu that we didn't understand without so much as an eye roll.

Don't be an idiot--get it. Pancakes layered with bacon and drenched in maple syrup are a great idea.  Our server was also really helpful while ordering and saw how tired we were (red eye flight the day right after we graduated... bad idea) and brought us a complimentary order of tea to wake us up for the rest of our day. :)",

However, she was disappointed by the mash and gravy and said it tasted really stale; like it had been sitting out all day. I came literally for the mac and cheese and it was pretty good. I could've done without the chips it came with because they weren't really anything special, but the mac was creamy and did it's job. Nothing we had was particularly outstanding but it was decent and definitely comforting.",

My bf ordered their fish and chips, and I ended up having dessert for lunch --treacle and date pudding! The fish and chips were good, although I'm not a fan of mushy peas. My friends enjoyed their sausage and mash orders, and I loved my dessert! At first, I wasn't too sure about the choice, because I normally don't eat dates, and I was looking for more of a tart/pie. But the waitress recommended it, so I decided to try it out. I'm so glad I did! It was delicious, still warm, and very rich, so it paired nicely with the ice-cream. If you're looking for dessert at Mums, try the treacle and date pudding!",

Goodness me.  The sheer enthusiasm for the menu shown by our waitress, the delight she took in recommending her favourite dishes (the venison is a winner, apparently) and helping us to choose the best combination of sausage, mash and gravy was worth the fifth star in itself. But the food didn't let this down - super flavoursome, obviously good quality, and very hot. I had a chocolate milkshake, too, which was just as a milkshake should be; ice cream based, and thick enough to stand a straw in.  I'll be back for sure! I was having an iffy morning and lunch here was just what the doctor ordered to set me back on track and go into the weekend with my head held high! And my stomach held in my hands...",

The hollandaise sauce had a but too much sour flavour in it, not sure if its lemon or... it just didn't taste balanced.

I went with two of the sausage-of-the-day selections (pork and leek, beef with onions and garlic) and the cheese and onion mash. For the gravy, I asked for a recommendation between the traditional brown and the caramelized onion - without hesitation, the server recommended the caramelized onion. \"Every time,\" she said. So, I went with that.   Everything was outstanding - the flavors in the sausages and mash were so good that I hardly needed the gravy (though it was delicious, too).

It was DELICIOUS. And the chips/fries/whatever you call them were fantastic. And wow, I was actually full by the time I finished my meal! That's rare for me. Really cool. And the desserts are awesome, and the range of milkshakes available is drool-worthy... I'm getting hungry just thinking about it all.  PS: It's awesome for vegetarians; the person who brought me is one and calls this place a big favorite. :)",

Service was friendly and I REALLY wanted to love this place. Good food for the non-adventurous. Not so great for the price and taste. Not fine dining, but not they do have tables. If you don't mind standing, I would recommend a food cart instead.  If you want to sit pick another place. If you just landed on the shores of Scotland after being stranded on an island and want a starter meal to get your taste buds started again- - this is your place.   Not bad, not great.

Whiskies to warm your soul? Can I just live here?  The haggis was amazing. Sure, it was my first time (but it wasn't my last), and nobody did it better than Mums. If you're concerned about the taste, it's a lot worse on paper. Give it a shot and pay attention to all the flavors blending together. And of course, the gravy.  For my main, I had their special of the day, which was a game pie. I believe it was venison. Served in a gigantic flaky crust with chips and veggies on the side. It's something I want to eat every time it's rainy or snowy outside. Also, it was a TON of food.  But the best part of Mums? How inexpensive everything was. Definitely stop by if you're in Edinburgh!",

I went in on a Saturday afternoon and they were swamped. A server recommended that I try again in 20 minutes. When I came back they were able to seat me right away. This isn't a fast in and out place and has the feel of a real mom and pop stop. On top of coming here to leisurely dine, their food is also amazing. I had the bangers and mash. For starters there are so many options to chose from just for this one dish! It was amazing how fresh the sausage tested. I ended with the cranchan.

    "text": "The food and service at Mum's was great, but the seating was a little claustrophobic, which is why I'm giving this a 4/5.   On our first day in Edinburgh, we dropped into Mum's because we were craving something hearty, comforting, and traditional (I especially wanted to try haggis as soon as possible). There are like 2393472847249 restaurants to choose from near Edinburgh's Old Town, and honestly, we chose this one because it appeared on a few \"best of\" lists online.   The restaurant isn't small by European standards, but because it was pretty busy, it felt small. We were seated at a table near the back, which was pretty dim despite it being the middle of the day (you can tell by the poor lighting in my food photos). Next to us, were seated a group of young women who appeared to know each other from one of the hostels nearby. That being said, this place definitely caters/appeals to travelers/Americans.   Our server was pleasant, quick, and able to explain the menu items to us. No complaints at all.  I ordered the haggis from the \"Starters\" portion of the menu, to kick things off. For those that don't know, haggis is Scotland's traditional dish and it's made with ground up sheep/calf organs, spices, oats, and other things. I was hesitant as hell about trying this, but it smelled pretty good and was plated beautifully, on a bunch of mashed potatoes and other veggies. It also came with a gravy boat. I immediately poured gravy all over mine, which was kind of a mistake as I found the gravy to be overpowering and salty. The haggis, however, was pretty good, especially when eaten with the veggies. It's got a very unique and strongly-spiced flavor that I honestly can't compare to anything else. Just try it. Order one for the table and let everyone take a bite.   Since I ordered something so unusual for me as a starter, I went with something I knew I'd love for my main dish - a vegan pumpkin and sage pie. The pies come in regular/large sizes and I'm glad I got a regular, because my friend ordered a large-sized one and it was HUGE. As a pumpkin/squash fanatic, I was all about this pie. It was flavorful, hot, and comforting. The pastry was crispy and delicious. I'm not vegan and I was very pleased.  The pie was served with peas and carrots, which were pretty bland, but that seems to be the UK standard. I love those veggies anyway, so I ate them all. Also, chips (french fries) because everything in the UK comes with a side of chips. At this point in my trip, I realized that the chips at basically every place I went to look and taste pretty much the same. I don't know if they all use the same frozen chips supplier?  Finally, I had to try one of their sausages. I wish I could remember which one I ordered, but it was on their specials menu (there were three options). I asked the waitress to pick her favorite, and she did. I know it was pork-based and really delicious.   Anyway, a good place to drop in if you're in the area. I wouldn't go again, just because I'd rather try one of the other bazillion restaurants that maybe appeal more to the locals.",

The food was not exceptional, and the service was somewhat slow (although that's what we've encountered throughout most of the places in the city), which made it really 3.5 stars, but the lively atmosphere and good selection of comfort food bumped it up to 4. We had a good time. There was a large selection of sausages, and I chose the pork, with leek and bacon mash and brown gravy. Others had the pumpkin and sage pie (a little light in on filling) and the shepherds pie. Everything pretty good. Plan on taking your time here, as service was slow on just about everything (but as mentioned, this seemed par for the course in Edinburgh). They messed up a milkshake order and gave us one free instead of remaking it (?). Overall, the selection and atmosphere got Mum's to 4.",

The server was super accommodating in helping me find a dish that was suitable to the size of how much food intake I had. I ordered the starter version of the HAGGIS. Mash, pureed turnip, and haggis was the perfect combination and size. I finished MOST of it and topped it off with a GINGER BEER. I wish I had friends to come with to try other dishes. If you're visiting from out of town I HIGHLY recommend checking out the restaurant for lunch or dinner! ENJOY!",

My husband was berated loudly in front of other patrons the moment we walked in because the lady behind the counter didn't hear him say hello (which he did). I think she thought she was being clever, but for us being embarrassed before we even sat down was not a great way to start a meal. At one point while we were ordering, the same lady told me to relax. Top tip: if you want to create a relaxing atmosphere, maybe don't yell at your customers?  The server who took over halfway through the meal was much better, but she couldn't (and nor should she have to) compensate for her rude colleague.  The food was average. The maple syrup advertised is not maple syrup.   This might have been a completely different review (with at least two more stars) if the service had have been even sort of better.  I hate wasting my money while on holiday. A really disappointing experience.",

Instead we get a slightly more modernised take on it, with decor of a similar ilk. I've only ever had sausage and mash in here, but there's that many variations on it there's really not much chance you'll get bored. As a serious carnivore, I recommend going for the beefiest sausage possible.  I'm perhaps missing out on some of Monster Mash's delights as I have a weird thing where I don't eat gravy. Along with ketchup, just looking at it makes me want to heave. It just looks like meat-flavoured water to me.",

    "text": "Hungry? Cold and wet from Edinburgh's fantastic weather?  Then this is the place for you!  Monster Mash is my reliable pick for an evening of safe, good food. I often use the excuse of entertaining visitors to make a trip here, and it never fails to impress. It has the joys of hearty pub food that you know isn't overpriced and cooked up in a microwave with comfortable, diner like surroundings and friendly service.   The food on offer is not going to help your waistline but it is well worth the treat.  The menu boasts a vast array of sausages, burgers, pies and haggis, proper comfort food that you know is going to fill you up and leave you feeling more than satisfied. Also make sure to look out for the special sausage of the day, there is often an interesting flavour or two there. Combine that with the different choices of mash (nothing like a good Champ mash!) and whatever gravy takes your pick. Now gravy lovers take note! Your gravy comes in your own special gravy boat, to my boyfriend who would quite happily bath in gravy this is a great treat.   I have tried and loved the haggis, sausages, fish and chips and steak pie (jeez, have I really eaten there that many times?). The mash is always delicious as is the gravy, and the portions are huge. Don't go in and say \"only two sausages? What kind of place is this?\" (as most of the males I have visited with have commented) as I guarantee you will be fit to burst afterwards. If your still hungry and can manage dessert, I recommend the Apple Crumble or go for an old school Chocolate Milkshake. To round it all off, your bill comes with Fruit Salads and Black Jacks- nothing like a bit of nostalgia.   So all that is left to do is to decide who is paying and who will be left with the Black Jacks (yuck).",

Now, I haven't been there lately, but I'll try and give it a semi-accurate review...  The basics: Pub fare, with a certain house specialty. Yup, that would be the bangers n' mash. You get a choice of bangers (to those who do not originate in the UK, sausage) and mash ( again, mashed potatoes).  The sausages are usually interesting flavors and meats, but they are always, always, delectable. And the mash is the same way.  If it is your first time venturing inside, do yourself a favor. Get this.  If you feel like something else, their steak and ale pie (with chips) is a surefire bet.",

Sausages were fantastic, pure meat, very spicy which warmed me up on such a cold day.  Followed the sausages with their sticky date pudding - 3.95 (all desserts are 3.95), which was super tasty.  As MUMS is apparently the re-branded Monster Mash of old, they have really improved the quality of the fool and there is far more choice now and service was excellent.  I would thoroughly recommend anyone to check out MUMS, the food was fantastic and excellent value with lovely friendly service.",

I've been here twice, the first time was a few months ago.. where we had fabulous service and I was merely \"whelmed\" (did Clueless ever clarify if one could just be 'whelmed'??) by the food...  my bangers & mash arrived rather lukewarm with rather dry mash and lukewarm gravy just made it all a bit meh....  D's pie looked rather more impressive with a HUGE pastry top!  Went again last night with a couple of friends visiting from out of town as they have a 10month old and I thought it would be child friendly..  We were directed to a table at the back (room to park the pram & room for a high chair), which was only half set and still had food on the table... Umm.. Not wanting to make a fuss, we sat anyway and I thought surely she'd bring a cloth to wipe the table when she brought the menus... No... I had to ASK for her to clean the table... Then I has to ask for cutlery when our starters arrived.. (I was secretly hoping she would have noticed we didn't have cutlery while wiping the table and bring us some before our food arrived...) Maybe she just thought deep fried camembert is best consumed using fingers...??  D's bangers & mash arrived around about lukewarm and judging by the amount of gravy him and P went thru, I assume the mash was pretty dry.... My venison pie was ok.. no complaints but nothing I'm rushing back for...M said her buffalo burger was very good, so maybe will have to try that next time...  D was going to order dark choc & cherry ice cream but they \"should really change the menu because we've not had it for ages now\"... Gah!!  At which point we asked for the bill... which was bought... but then no offer of change or a card machine.. or... well... anything....  we sat around for a while then decided just to pay at the bar on the way out as the baby needed to get back for his bedtime and I wasn't sure she was EVER going to come and take our money... (maybe she was trying to hint that dinner was on her??!!)  Not to be a total negative Nelly...  The milkshakes were delicious as always! :)",

    "text": "I've been to Mums many times and there's a reason why - it's absolutely delicious, filling, and a great value for money!  I went again last night and had three sausages accompanied with mashed potatoes. I chose the Spanish chorizo, garlic and ginger, and the ale and watercress sausages. My favourite of the three was the ale and watercress. I accompanied the sausages with the chipotle and cheese mash! In addition, I had a Crunchie milkshake! I haven't had a milkshake since I was about 19 so I was looking forward to it (don't know why it had been so long!) and boy was it tasty. My partner had similar sausages but chose the blackpudding and apple mash. We shared a cranachan for dessert - which was my first! It was very creamy and had fresh raspberries.    The service was great, very welcoming and relaxed.   This is a great restaurant fairly close to the Royal Mile and the Museum of Scotland. It's a worthwhile visit if you're in the area!  I'll be back soon to try the Wagyu burger!!!!",

    "text": "I come here anytime I'm craving \"soul food\" and it definitely satisfies my craving. They have a range of different sausages, mash potatoes, and gravies that turns you into that annoying indecisive person. It's the type of restaurant you go to where you finally decide what you wanted to eat, but once your friend's plates come out, you all decide to eat off each others plates.  The staff is extra friendly every time I have gone! The first time I went it was a bit slow, so the cook popped his head out of the kitchen to ask us if the food was good and when we were having trouble deciding what to eat, he recommended some stuff off the menu. Also, I was being indecisive on whether i should get an extra gravy pot for my chips, and the cook told me that when he brings out my friend's gravy, he will put enough in there so I can use it as well. Very very kind service!   I've also had their apple pie with custard and it was grand except the custard needed to be a tad sweeter, but it was still enjoyable and i would recommend anyone to try it!   The only reason why i can't give Mums 5 stars is that it's a bit expensive, still affordable and definitely worth the money, but not a place i can go to every time I'm feeling hungry... and that's like... all the time.  You will definitely go home knowing you had a good hearty meal.",

Drawn to Mums because of the promise of traditional British fare, and they definitely delivered!  My American travel companion and I (also American, but resident in the UK) tucked into some sausage and mash, with a variety of sausages including one I made her get because I wanted to try called Satan's Revenge which was insanely spicy and delicious.  I was pointed in the direction of a special pie they had that was off the menu and filled with various game meats including venison, pigeon, and pheasant, although I think there were more.  Oh my goodness, that pie comes out and its pastry top is bigger than your head!  And I have a giant noggin!  And it was SO tasty!  Had the leek and bacon mash with it, which admittedly needed a bit of salt, but with the brown gravy, was a-ok.  So another good review on the pile for Mums!  Its popularity is not unwarranted.  Go!  Eat some tasty comfort food like your British mother would cook, but I don't have a British mother so I just have to run on the knowledge that it's just darn tasty.",

The idea of a good fry up seemed like the perfect idea.    Luckily it wasn't too long of a wait and got a nice quiet table to the back.  I ordered the full veggie breakfast and had your usual flare of items.  I really liked the veggie sausage that was made with carrots and other good stuff.  It also didn't feel too overwhelmingly greasy as well which was good.  The place was busy and service was a tad slow but they completely made up for it with their personality when they got around to you.  It's a nice place to chill out for a bit and not feel rushed for anything.  I'd like to come back and try some of the other lunch/dinner options.  Next year at the Fringe!",

The shepherd's pie was tasty (if small) and I have to appreciate joints that write their current craft beer offerings on a chalkboard. Speaking of beer, though, the Scottish ale recommended to me was bland and flat, and my side of veggies (peas, carrots, and corn) came canned and heated a la microwave. Given the wee size of my pie, most of my meal was quite a let-down.  My disappointment led me to skip the pudding, but based on other reviews, if I'm ever back at Mums I'll just stick to the bangers and mash.",

There was some drama over recent years about the ownership of the name and another place called Monster Mash opened a few doors along, forcing the original to rename itself Mum's Great Comfort Food, which doesn't exactly roll off the tongue. But the impostor has closed now, so we're back with the original place, if not the original name.  And what a simple but brilliant concept. As the other reviewers have said, this is a retro British diner but with a knowing modern spin.  Alongside a list of traditional food (shepherd's pie, macaroni cheese, fish pie, etc.), the personalised sausage and mash menu is the reason to come here. Choose your sausages individually from a changing selection (plus one or two veg options). Choose your mash from a long list of styles, then choose from three kinds of gravy. Under 9 for three sausages, mash and gravy. Yum. Simple, classic, cool. There's also a two sausage option, plus they do a lunch deal where you get soup plus one sausage and mash for a fiver.  Last time I was there they were playing classic British rock and had Danger Mouse on the tv. If it gets any more British I'm putting a knotted hanky on my head.  The booze options are fairly good, with a few bottled ales. However the last couple of times I've had a pint of Scottish Thistly Cross cider. I'm not normally a cider drinker, but this goes really well with sausages. Apple-based but with a hint of ginger, very refreshing and easy to drink. A bit steep at 4.25 a pint, but I can't resist.  And the espresso here is quite good as well. Much better than you would expect outside of a proper cafe. Even the sweets you get with your bill are nice. They just manage to get everything right. Can you tell I love this place?",

Everything warm, soft and comforting from your childhood is served on a plate here at Mums to warm your heart and belly and fortify you against the Edinburgh rains.   The menu is heavily situated around sausages and mash, but they serve local, all-natural sausages and quite the variety of them! You're able to choose your sausages (all different kinds, if you're peckish), your mash (a good dozen or so varieties on the menu as well) and your gravy. There's also a good selection of pies and several other comfort foods.   The decor is cozy, with a retro 70s feel, and the servers are warm and friendly. I tried the pork, garlic and ginger sausage with garlic and mushroom mash and brown gravy, while the boy had a steak and ale pie. Both hearty, tasty and filling for a grey afternoon. I imagine this would be a good pick-me-up after a pub crawl as well, if you're into that sort of thing.",

Sausage and Mash, Pies, etc. But unlike my mum's home cooking there is a great range of sausage, numerous ways you want your potatos, etc and they will serve you alcohol with it to, definitely not my mum's way.  The food is good, the staff a brilliant, quite crazy, and the atmosphere is relaxed.",

I had a pancake stack for breakfast, which was great. The combination of maple syrup, pancakes and streaky bacon just hit the spot. If I'm ever in Edinburgh again for breakfast this will be what I want!",

The deluxe hot chocolate is to die for! Highly recommended!!",

    "text": "Love it, love it, love it!  I really don't have a bad word to say about this place. We were here for the second time last week and it was just as good as the first. Firstly the service is great. I wanted a milkshake but I'm a wee bit lactose intolerant so I asked the waitress if they had a milk alternative. She said in general, no, but one of the girls that works there is also lactose intolerant so they made me one with her own stash of soya milk, how kind! The milkshake was chocolate flavoured and really yummy. My other half had a Barney's beer, which are always good and made locally.   Foodwise, I opted for bangers (plain pork) and mash (leek and bacon) with caramelised onion gravy and a side of baked beans. It was like a hug on a plate. It's so great that you get different options to chose from and that they have daily specials. Think I'll try the chorizo next time! The portions are incredibly generous, so much so that I couldn't finish my plate which is really not like me. However, I did have space for desert, but more on that later! My fiance opted for the Mac and Cheese and thoroughly enjoyed it. I tried a wee bit, and while it's not quite as good as my mum's (isn't that always the case with mac and cheese and lasagne?!), it's pretty darn tasty!    Then comes desert. Both of us were pretty stuffed but couldn't resist ordering a little something something to share. We chose the chocolate tart which was served warm with ice-cream covered in some sort of berry coulis. It was really tasty, almost like brownie pie. I would definitely order it again.  I was also pleasantly surprised with the price. It was only 25 for both us, not breaking the bank at all!   There's not much negative to say about it. It is a wee big dingy through the back, but it is very clean and they pull of the British diner look quite well. Plus, I found myself singing along to almost every song that came over the sound system. And the fruit salads and blackjacks that came with the bill were a cute wee touch.   Over all, yes go there, it's great. Especially when it's a horrid day outside and you feel like eating your ow bodyweight in stodge.",
