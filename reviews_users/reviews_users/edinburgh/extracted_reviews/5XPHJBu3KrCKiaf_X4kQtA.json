    "text": "Herbie is still a staple in my culinary tool belt and the purveyor of a million sauces I didn't know I needed. In fact, it's evolved into a new role over the last few months as a go-to lunch spot. The sandwiches & rolls they have aren't fancy... they're not over the top... they're good cheese  or pate on a fresh bun and really, what more can you ask for on a gloomy day?   I've recently tried my hand at bread baking, so I heartily tip the hat to the fresh options here. Simply put: Herbie makes everything look easy, and I still love them for it.  So why the dip down in stars? I'm not sure if they're busier or I'm just coming at odd hours, but the shelves seem a little less stocked than they once were and my eyes aren't quite as wide while i'm browsing the collection but does that mean this place is in danger of falling off my go-to list? Heck no. It's still a brilliant little shop.",

    "text": "I've been here once before in the search of a good feta cheese to add to my dinner, and have to say it was one of the best I've ever had.   It's a tiny little shop with little variety compared to others, say Henri's or IJ Mellis, however they do have a decent selection of deli meats which I was on the hunt for today. Depending on what you like (my favoraite cheeses are at IJ Mellis and I buy certain meats from Henri's), Herbie's might have a small something to contribute, but it wouldn't be my first choice if I'm after meat, cheese and wine.   It's a very cute shop with lovely service that is well worth checking out, but I guess if you already know where your favourites are you could forgo Herbie's and not miss out on much.",

    "text": "Herbie's does my head in. This branch is tiny, which means if you're a claustrophobe like me you can only shop here mid week. At the weekend there are too many folk in too small a space stocking up on Artisan bread and chicken liver pate. That said, their pate is the finest this side of the Channel. But (and it is a whopper of a 'but') the artisan loaves come in at just under 3 and there is no space to browse. Pick a quiet moment and you can enjoy the wide range of fresh deli produce and bottled oils, preserves and trucklements. Dither during a busy moment and you'll be as welcome as a tourist in a New York diner.",

The first day we moved here, we went straight there to buy it's famous portobello bacon, stonebaked bread and organic cider and we've been returining faithfully every week since. The shop itself is teeny (although they have larger premesis just around the corner) and the staff are a tad snooty, but the deli is fabulous and their fresh bread is legendary.",
