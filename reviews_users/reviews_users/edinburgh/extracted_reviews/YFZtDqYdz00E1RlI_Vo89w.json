    "text": "My husband and I stopped in for dinner on our last night in Edinburgh.  We didn't have a reservation and got there around 5:30, but were able to easily get a seat.  When we left, the restaurant was nearly full, so if you are planning for dinner around 7+, you might want to get a reservation.    We decided to start with momos.  Our first experience with the dish was on a recent trip to London and we really enjoyed them.  The momos at The Khukuri were even better--they were exceptional!  We got the tandoori and the chili momos, both chicken, both delicious.  The chili were quite special--a spicy, savoury sauce--and there were plenty of fragrant peppers and onions accompanying the dish.    Our server asked if we would like to wait for our main course--I have never had anyone ask that before, but it was perfect.  It gave our stomachs time to enjoy the appetizer and settle before eating the larger dishes.  When we did get the main course, again, everything was beautiful and delicious.  We both chose Nepalese dishes that were unfamiliar to us, and I am afraid I don't recall the names, but both were quite tasty.  One thing to note, entrees don't come with rice, so be sure to order a side of rice if you want rice to accompany your dishes.    My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal here, and will definitely return on our next trip to Scotland.",

They brought out a number of starter dishes so we did not have to choose everything by single person (even accommodating for the vegetarians). They also have such a variety of dishes that when it came time to order for 15 people, the staff were very patient.  The food was great, served with some Nepali beer, and a variety of rices and naan. The owner even gave us (all 15) a small desert on the house because we were celebrating a birthday. They even wrote out a card!  Overall the dining experience was great and matched the food as well. I highly enjoyed it.",

They really mean king prawn, the thing was massive! With this they also include a vegetable curry, rice pilaf, and a yoghurt sauce. Got some Naan on the side which was very fresh. Service was great also, very friendly atmosphere.",

    "text": "A wee Nepalese place that never struck me as one worth trying till my team leader got us there twice for lunch, and how glad I was for his recommendation!!!  The first time we had a l carte dishes, so I opted for the (very generous) lamb biryani, which I found only 2nd best for the variety I have tried in Edinburgh!! Some guys ordered the Nepalese beer named Khukuri  (Khukuri stands for the traditional Nepalese blade), and they were impressed of the gentle and refreshing taste it has (brewed in London).  For our second visit we tried out the excellent lunch deal 7.95 for two courses or 8.35 for three (where the third dish is either a coffee or a simple home made dessert). You have quite a decent choice for main dish, and both the naan bread and chapati were very tasty! There was also a mouth-watering starter, Sekuwa, which you definitely need to try, grilled chicken with spices and an awesome sauce!!  In both cases I had Mango Lassi, which helps balancing whatever spicy curry you will get (recommended over a beer!). The service was very good in both cases, and the prices are very reasonable!  Now I need to decide what dish to try next!!!",

I came here with my flatmates late last year and we all thought it was great value for money considering what a good time we had.  The restaurant itself feels quaint and cosy with neatly laid out tables, relaxing decor and some of the most friendly staff you could ask for.   The menu has an extensive range of authentic Indian dishes and prides itself particularly on the quality of its meat.  I went for the lamb Rogan Josh which had tender chunks of lamb in an aromatic and flavoursome sauce.  They also serve big, filling portions of rice to go with their main dishes. We spent less than a tenner each when the final bill came which we all thought was excellent deal.  This place is definitely worth a look!",

At 24 per head for only main courses (3 curries, 3 rice and one naan) and beers this was more than I'd paid in quite a while but it does seem to be out of the ordinary thankfully, at least when you're missing out both a starter and a dessert.   No complaints about the food itself, or for that matter the service although the waiting staff did seem to have the odd problem understanding my German guests (both of whom have an excellent command of English) so they're maybe used solely to Edinburgh accents. I will not though be back here anytime soon.",

The Khukuri is a Nepalese restaurant, I'm not a food expert but I just find their food more enjoyable than Indian food, I think its got more flavour.  When we moved to Edinburgh about 10 years ago we started taking vistors to the Khukuri and everyone of them said it was the best Asian restaurant that they had eat in and on return visits to Edinburgh our friends always requested a return visit to the Khukuri There is an extensive menu, the food is great, the service is superb, I just can't find any faults in the place, its a little gem.

We found it by the simple expedient of getting off the bus at a spot that had a lot of restaurants and reading the menu cards outside them till we found on that looked interesting. This one seemed both not too expensive and good. There was a single article outside about the awards the chef had won and though every Asian restaurant seems to have signs like this outside, this one seemed to be modest about it's achievements and we thought we'd give it a try. Thank heavens we did. The service was impeccable with the attentive Nepalese waiter guiding us through the menu and recommending what turned out to be delicious dishes. The food was truly superb and I would have given the chef an award on the spot if I had one handy :). The atmosphere is nice but nothing special but for food like this, I'd sit on the street and eat it! Do visit.",
