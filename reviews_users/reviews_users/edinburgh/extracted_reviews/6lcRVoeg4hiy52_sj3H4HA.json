    "text": "This has the potential to be a great local pub, with a decent selection of beers and excellent food. There was an excellent choice of real ale on tap, as well as an extensive selection of bottled beers. Their house lager (which we heard was brewed in-house) was pretty decent at 2.50/pint, and the other beers weren't overpriced either.  Food was American style, smoked meats, burgers, hot dogs. I had a pulled pork hot dog with sweet potato fries, and they were both excellent and decent sized portions.   Decor is a rustic/steampunk mix, and seating could be improved, our tables were crowded  a bit too close. It advertises itself as a sports bar, and although there were large screens they were muted, for which I was thankful. However, it may be different if there's a major event on - not to everyone's taste.",

When she could break away from the patrons, one of the bartenders pulled up a map on her phone and gave me very specific directions that took me right to the house, and I promised to come back in for dinner before I left the city. The food was good, they smoke their meat in-house, have a good selection of local craft beers, and the prices were beyond reasonable. The staff was just as friendly on my second visit, recommending their favorite drinks, encouraging me to try the homemade sauces, and even giving me a canvas tote with the bar logo on it when they couldn't find a plastic bag for my leftovers. I hope I get back to Edinburgh someday, and if I do, I will most certainly eat here again.",

Also liked the large choice of sauces on the table, nice touch. The fries were a bit disappointing, especially next to the burger - they were probably unnecessary as the burger filled me up. I didn't have a drink, but I hope I'll be returning and will sample some then!",

    "text": "Popped in with three friends for burgers after a busy evening carolling. I've been meaning to come to Clerk's for ages, so I'm glad I finally did so. The place is nice inside- plenty of seating, warm, nice atmosphere. Service was quick- drinks orders were taken almost immediately on arrival.  After perusing the large menu of burgers, hot dogs, and other such items, we all decided to go for burgers. One of us ordered a simple beef burger with bacon, another a \"nacho burger\" (vegetarian), and myself and one other chose a burger with pulled pork and apple. All with chips. Excellent.  Sadly, the server soon returned to inform us there wasn't sufficient pulled pork for two. Ah well, not the end of the world. I changed to a beef burger with bacon.  The food arrived fairly quickly, and all at the same time. The burgers all looked amazing. They tasted great too. We all left feeling satisfied and full at the end of the evening. Sadly, the chips were very disappointing. I was hoping for some nice home-made pub chips, but got very average quality frozen chips.  Next time, I won't be getting chips at all, because the burgers are big enough and tasty enough to constitute a meal, as far as I'm concerned. Overall, I definitely recommend Clerk's Bar. It's a nice place, in a nice location, with very nice burgers.",

Interesting though that the noise upstairs (I've yet to investigate the basement level) was actually possibly even worse than on a Saturday night. There was football on the tv certainly but only one rowdy table yet its noise was chanelled throughout the bar. Not the most pleasant working environment if you've to put up with that on a regular basis.",

    "text": "Having heard about the opening on Twitter, I nipped in on opening night to see what Clerk's Bar had to offer, and, like Alan S, was pleasantly surprised.  I'm not, generally speaking, a pubs person myself, least of all for pubs with sports on the screen, but Clerk's has a dash of difference. The two screens (one showing a Champions League footie match on STV, the other showing a different footie match on Sky Sports) were well-placed such that you could position yourself most places in the bar and still get a decent view, added to which the sound on the STV match was up loud enough that it was audible over the chatter (I find commentary one of the most interesting parts of watching sports on telly, so in bars it's normally pointless for me).  Already well-populated by those in the know and quick off the mark, the place was already thriving with a lovely warm atmosphere; I only just managed to get a stool at the bar. Big tick for the bar stools, by the way - sturdy, in heavy cast iron with good solid wooden seat-tops that spin around for adjustable height (and for ease of fun swivelling).  The decor is stylish, in a woodeny kind of way, with some seriously cool lightbulbs over the bar (zig-zaggy filament joy) and the staff at the bar were really friendly despite the fact that business was pretty steady and they weren't getting much chance to rest. The menu looks really great - lovely slow-cooked things, burritos, burgers, smoked yumness... I'd love to have tried something but I'd just eaten, will definitely head back to give it a go as it really seems my kind of place. If they're showing the snooker World Champs, I must just end up living there!",

Clerk's serves simple, tasty comfort food-pulled pork, ribs, mac'n'cheese, cheesy fries. (So okay, if you're veggie, you might not love it... ) During our visits we have enjoyed their tasty pulled pork sliders, burritos and deliciously messy nachos. Food is served in plastic 'diner-style' baskets and is hearty rather than pretty.   They also have a lot of beer stuff going on. I'm not a beer drinker myself, but apparently their beers 'weren't all that' according to others that I was with.   They have a range of tables and even had a whole downstairs section. The place is pretty busy, mostly with students and the service is friendly (if a little cheesy)! They have a nice mix of wooden tables etc but there is a kind of odd semi-sports bar theme. I reckon it would be better without the sports screens!   Overall, Clerk's in a nice addition to the area. It's just new so I reckon it might improve with time. It's a good place to meet up with a few friends if you fancy something easy and near. Simple, tasty food in a handy location.",

If there's football on one of the many screens then it's really a sports bar with little space and there were a lot of headbangers frequenting it on these occasions.  I like the food mind you and it's hard to get a lot of what they do elsewhere, namely ribs. I love ribs. I really love ribs.   My suggestion would be to go during the day at the weekend with some pals and get one of the window booths that are very rarely empty later on in the night.   The staff are friendly and the most important thing for me is always Value for Money and this place delivers on that.",

    "text": "Clerk's had been open for about a week when I visited with friends for a couple drinks and something to eat. It had been advertising craft beers, sports on TV and slow smoked food. I'm not a fan of sports and was a bit worried that it might put me off, they had two large TVs (upstairs, I didn't go downstairs) showing a Europa League game on with the sound down, nobody seemed to be watching them but you could easily follow the game from most seats if you wished, I can imagine it being popular for more  locally relevant games.   The decor is fairly modern and there is a mixture of tables with high bar stools, booths and lower tables. It gave me the impression sort of like an american diner style but not as plastic and tacky. We arrived about 17:30 and there not that many empty tables for four available but we found one near the back which was squashed in between other tables, it looked very cramped and difficult to actually get around into the seats against the wall, however once seated it did not feel especially cramped.  It was very busy for a Thursday night in that part of town but the service was efficient and friendly.  The food is also americana inspired with hot dogs, burritos, burgers on offer as well as slow smoked cooked ribs, chicken (half or whole) and pulled pork (there are also vegetarian options like Mac n' cheese or mushroom burgers). All the food is served in plastic baskets with waxed paper which adds to the american diner feel. I chose to go for the pulled pork which comes with corn on the cob (about half a cob), I also ordered a side order of \"skinny fries\" and \"BBQ Beans\" I did think that having to spend an extra 2 for each of these was a bit excessive on top of the 7 for the pork but it was good, the pulled pork was beautifully cooked with a strong smoky flavour, the fries and beans were good if not exceptional, so probably a reasonable price. My friends had a couple different hot dogs and a mushroom burger, all seemed satisfied with their order.  They have a selection of beers available including three on cask and three \"craft\" beers on keg (these are priced around the 3.60 mark), one of their casks beers is \"Pentland IPA\" (from Stewart Brewing), the other two are guests (both also Stewart's when we visited)  that change, on keg they have \"Caesar Augustus\" plus two guests, there is also a selection of more mainstream beers/lagers (including a house lager for 2.50 a pint).  They also have a fairly wide selection of bottled beers, spirits and wines so something to suit everybody.  I might have given it 4 stars if not for the sports aspect (I'm not a sports fan) and may visit again although it does have some strong competition nearby that are more to my taste. Assuming they can maintain their current standards I can see it being a popular addition.",

    "text": "New in Newington  I was havering over 3 or 4 stars for this place, but I couldn't justify judging it average as it is better than that. I feel that they have clearly defined what they are about on the outside, but it gets a little bit lost on the inside, and when I say that I am referring to the mixed bag decor. However, service and product is of a very good standard, though that's normally the case when a new bar opens.  The positives? The beer range is good, real ale, craft beer as well as euro classics available. A good bottled range makes it unlikely that your beer taste won't be met. Their spirit range, however, is a little bit limited, but the basics are there. I haven't looked at their wine list, but I saw their house wine is very cheap (less than 15 a bottle) so that's great - though its almost 5 for some Sam Adams which is classed as a pretty run of the mill beer stateside.  The food is pretty damn good. We had a sharing platter with a huge portion of meaty flavoursome ribs and half a chicken which was succulent and relatively tasty. They randomly give you a chunk of corn on the cob which isn't really for sharing unless you are happy sharing saliva also?? Each table has good range of sauces, the hot sauce being nice and nippy, though their honey mustard is a bit thin and ergo pointless. Good price point for the food also.  Table service is good and the staff take the time to engage with you, and seeing as they have been mobbed every time I go in, then that's good that they know to acknowledge their guests. I haven't been downstairs but apparently it's a good size also!  My main issue here is that, similarly to other nearby new pubs, they get a bit lost with the decor and furniture, the booths have random  metal bits, and there is a huge mural which looks like they should have paid more to get it done properly. Random hanging lights and the TVs aren't quite big enough.   They have also put a Gambling Machine in the corner, which I didn't think was an issue until I saw it, and I realised that none of the boozers I drink in actually have these. On both of my visits I noticed that the younger crowd tends not to use it, if it was my pub, I'd get rid.  Ultimately, this is a good bar, and I was pleasantly surprised, and will visit again. The big challenge here is how they will maintain the staffing levels and service, because that will make the difference. With the Southern, Cask & Barrel, and  Reverie flanking it, there is plenty of passing custom to keep it lively.",

I headed here for a friend's birthday drinks and arrived after everyone else had eaten, this meant the massive 'food accessories box' had to be left on the table for me, taking up a chunk of room. And for a such large box, why is there no mayo?!  My burger was good and the chips were pretty good too, but I wasn't happy that chips are separate from burgers (which are fairly similar in price to most places that do burgers *with* chips!) I also ordered a wine as I was sorting out my bits and catching my breath while I was asked I just ordered the house red and paid 4.70 for the privilege.   Really? You do a bottle for a tenner...just give me that!  I found the music very loud and more like a night club than a craft bar.  All that said, it's grand. It's a grand pub/food place. There's a decent mix of a crowd and we got some banter at the bar which is always a massive plus for me!  Overall, probably won't be back unless someone insists, there's better places around, but if I lived closer I would probably pop in now and again.",

There are adverts for cocktails too didnt see any of these getting made, but they look like they take there booze seriously.   From the face book page they seem to take pride in their food. The menu I am told is meat based however said they would be offering a smoked mushroom burger and  mac cheese sliders. My veggie friends are catered for too.

After having eaten a lot of fish and chips, haggis and Scottish pubby food, this place provided some comfort food with a twist. My 10 year-old polished off his Sloppy Jessica sandwich made with delicious vegetarian chili topped with home-made mac and cheese. The other son and wife ate the Notorious Pig with pulled pork and Mac and cheese baked together in a skillet. I had a burger called the Filthy One, topped with bacon, pulled pork and smoked cheddar. Sweet potato fries made an excellent side.  The beer menu had some outstanding local choices, including from Stewart's Brewing.",

Great place to watch the footie and hang out with the lads if that's your thing.",

    "text": "For a new craft beer premises it's ok and the staff seem to know a good deal of what they are talking about.  The interior is nice and cosy with lots of seating.  As part of of a group we were offered a beer tasting and nachos and chicken wings.  Quite happy to say I found a craft beer that I liked.  The nachos and chicken wings were ok, nothing screams out better than anywhere else.  It's nice and cosy downstairs where we had the event too.",

    "text": "LAST WEEK I was invited to the launch of Clerk's Bar on South Clerk Street.  This new bar is the latest addition to the Maclay Inns group, who have overseen a 400,000 refurbishment of this former Chinese restaurant.  With their new 'fresh food, cooked slow' philosophy and offering of craft beers, I went along to see what it was all about.  I had made the decision to review more pubs and step away (slightly) from my normal fine dining background.  This was also a great chance to mingle with some of the other great bloggers we have in Edinburgh.  Anyway... we were ushered down in to the basement bar at Clerk's where we were warmly greeted with a goodie bag and a drink (mine a Caesar Augustus and Sarah's a prosecco), as well as a promise that 'food would be here soon'.  The bar itself kind of reminded me more of a Glasgow city centre bar; open and bright upstairs, with a dark and cosy basement you'd expect to find somebody playing an acoustic guitar in.  Not that that's a bad thing. Sarah and I have been on a bit of a nacho binge recently, so the first serving of nachos was most welcome.  First bite was promising, as you could tell these were actually home made, not just poured out of a packet.  The nachos were light and accompanied by a zingy salsa and soothing soured cream.  However, why on earth would you tell me you don't use real cheese?  Next we were presented with some chicken wings in barbecue sauce.  The chicken was tender and the sauce did its job.  At least these were decent sized wings and not those tiny little morsels from a chicken that you probably don't want to know where it came from.  The staff were keen to chat and talk about their vision behind the bar and get feedback from us bloggers. They were very welcoming and took on any comments professionally.    Next came a behemoth of a sharing platter, which included 1/2 rack of ribs, 1/2 a chicken, pulled pork and was served with meaty beans and chips.  The team were keen to focus on the slow cooking and home smoking concept, and this would be a real acid test of the execution of that.  The ribs were tasty and tender, which a subtle but not overpowering smokiness to it, which was mirrored with the pulled pork and the chicken.  But, everything seriously lacked seasoning for me and there was no salt and pepper shakers on the tables.  The platter came with a range of sauces in squeezy bottles which was a bit different and i really liked the smoked ketchup.    I must mention those meaty beans (beans with pulled pork through them in a barbeque sauce) because you could have taken the rest of the food away and just left me with a plate of those.  Clerk's Bar is set up to watch various live sports, and i could see me sitting in there with one of those platters, having a few beers with mates.  Certainly great value at 15 because it could have easily fed four, and with a lot of students in this area, i reckon they could be on to a winner.   After a short beer tasting aimed to promote their range of craft beers, even more food was rolled out in the shape of sliders and hot dogs, sadly Sarah and I were too stuffed to taste.  Another time perhaps.",

    "text": "We were through in Edinburgh for a gig and Clerk's was nearby so we popped in for some pre-gig food. It was packed upstairs and very noisy as there was a rugby match being shown on the TVs. We grabbed a table downstairs in the basement, though there was a football match on the screen there with the volume up loud. The menu is similar to The Raven in Glasgow for anyone that's been there - burgers, ribs, meat platters, etc. plus a host of sides like potato wedges, corn on the cob, onion rings, etc. I had a mushroom burger - a large juicy flat mushroom on a brioche bun with salad, onion rings and I added an egg from the extra toppings list which also includes items like veg/beef chilli, haggis and chorizo! Halfway through eating it did get a bit messy as the bun went soggy and it started to fall apart but the burger tasted just fine. We shared sides of sweet potato fries and mac n cheese and these were good. The meal would've been a solid three but I didn't find the atmosphere and noise level enjoyable. They have a great selection of craft beers (I had a very tasty Drygate Gladeye IPA with my food). If you're a sports fan who likes a good beer and a bite this place is made for you.",
