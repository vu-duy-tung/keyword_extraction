    "text": "Excellent Turkish restaurant in Edinburgh where the food was delicious from start to finish.  Started with the saksuka which was amazing followed by the sigara boregi which was crispy and full of flavor.  Came with bread and a spicy sauce and yoghurt sauce on the side.  Adana kebob was juicy and flavorful but the real knock out was the karni yarik.  An amazing tomato sauce with a hollowed out eggplant half stuffed with minced spiced lamb which was out of this world.  Service was pretty fast and courteous and prices can stack up quickly but worth every pound.  Would love to come back and highly recommended.",

I got a chicken mushroom dish and it was very flavorful. After your meal definitely get the Turkish coffee as well. Service is a bit slow but otherwise this place is amazing!",

All were very very tasty  (especially the prawns ) then we shared 2 mains the chicken with baba ganoush and yoghurt harissa which was moist and juicy with a fabulous chargrilled flavour and the sea bass with prawns and white wine sauce- yum yum yum (( if anyone was a fan of La Favorita ' s faggotini this tastes better!) . Finished off with Turkish tea and coffee and turkish delight. I am more than delighted and will be visiting again often. Xx",

    "text": "This is one of the best Turkish Restaurants I have ever experienced. Also comfortable seating and fabulous service. What a way to end this business trip to the wonderful city of Edinburgh. No matter where you are staying in the city I highly recommend Ada. If you happen to be staying across the street like me at the well located and comfortable Marriott Courtyard all the better. The food was fresh with fabulous and plentiful portions. The menu is extensive and surely invites me back to Ada and Edinburgh. Great Turkish wine also. What a wonderful evening and end to my visit. I will be back!",

    "text": "Came in here due to the TripAdvisor reviews and left mostly thrilled with the experience. That said, the customer service was poor. My waitress came and took my order fairly quickly, but wasn't at all helpful in selecting a dish from their expansive menu, and I never saw her again. Someone else brought out my food, and no one ever checked on me at any point. No one ever asked if I wanted anything else, and no one ever brought me a bill. The tables around me got regular service, so this may have just been an oversight, but it didn't help my experience. The other tables seemed to get some sort of parting treat as well, a dessert bite of some sort, which never got brought by my table either. That all said, the food was plentiful and excellent. I got the lamb moussaka, which was delicious, and it came with a huge assortment of sides - pide bread, pilaf, grilled tomato & pepper, and a variety of sauces. I left full and mostly happy, despite finally having to get up and wait at the register to pay for my meal. Odd place. Service could easily bring this to a 5 star experience.",

    "text": "edinburgh is a place of many restaurants, but it seems that turkish cuisine is never too high on the list.  i think it's a bit of a shame as proper turkish food is so tasty so i was really glad to see a new restaurant opening up just along from the playhouse.  when my friend and i were looking for a place to go for dinner i suggested Ada and we booked a table.  i think this used to be one of the many indians that was along antigua street but i can't quite recall.  anyway the restaurant has been totally redone and made into a really welcoming and light space.  it's a bit strange as the front is domineered by the huge grill and you have to walk past this to get to the actual restaurant space.  when i first saw the restaurant was open i actually thought it was only a takeaway because of the huge grill and counter!  however the space is well laid out with lots of bright colours and a good number of tables although all of these were taken when we went on tuesday.  the menu is extensive and has the typical dishes you would expect- hummus, swarhma, hot and cold meze, falafel, etc but also has a bunch of dishes that were new to me.  after a debate between three dishes i went with karni yarik- minced lamb with peas in a tomato sauce on top of an aubergine all oven baked with rice and salad on the side.  we also shared hummus as a starter and were given a an aubergine type dip compliment of the chef.  the hummus was a large portion and given with fresh pide that was really moreish.  the smokey aubergine dip was really tasty as well.  my main course looked massive but being post run i managed to finish it all as it was too good to leave any over.  the minced lamb was incredibly savory and the aubergine was super tender.  it definitely enticed me to come back and try other dishes to see what else they offered.  service was probably the only downfall for this restaurant.  initially the waitress was prompt and very on top of things in terms of taking our ordering and bringing food.  but she never checked up on us during our meal or even asked if we wanted more drinks.  we had to pretty much throw ourselves in front of her to get the bill as well so they maybe need to keep their attentiveness throughout the whole service and not just the first half.  definitely a very good addition to this part of leith walk and i can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "The male waiter I first approached looked positively offended when I asked for seating for one. A lovely female wait staff person came up to me offered a big smile and was lovely, but at that point I said I would prefer to do take away. That takeaway was delicious. A huge falafel platter with grilled vegetables, couscous, rice, and bread was, for 10 pounds, far than anything I would get in the United States. The falafel were perfectly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, as they should be. Everything else was perfect. I heartily recommend this place, and if you are someone, like me, who is not thrilled to eat out alone, just do the takeaway. The cooks at the grill in front were also very friendly while I waited, so hopefully that other waiter was just having a bad night. Food here is great.",
