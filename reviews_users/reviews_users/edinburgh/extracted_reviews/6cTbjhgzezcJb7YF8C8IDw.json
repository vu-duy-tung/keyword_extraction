    "text": "Simple produce from Catalonia is to the fore at Forn, a lovely little cafe recently opened in Newington. Core to their offering is pa amb tomaquet (toast with tomato) topped with beautiful cured meats and cheeses. Catalan coffee rounds out their offering in good style. Well worthy of a visit!  Overall, we said: \"it was great to discover this burgeoning little gem. Forn packs great quality into its focussed range of dishes. I think it has a prime opportunity to carve out a niche for itself, so look forward to many future visits. Highly recommended.\"",
