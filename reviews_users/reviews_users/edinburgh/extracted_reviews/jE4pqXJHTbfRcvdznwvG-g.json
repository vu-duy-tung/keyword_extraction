    "text": "This shop is ugly, it has dated (one from 2011) magazines sitting on a coffee table and had I not been on a mission to try different Indians I would likely have walked past. However on a mission, I was and one part of the shop front actually stands up - \"For curry lovers\".  I have tried my usual selection of dishes (biryani, madras, chilli garlic) and have to say the food was of good standard, rich spice flavours came through as they should and the meat has always been tender and flavoursome. Part of that flavour though comes from the fact that they use chicken thigh and breast, this does mean you may get the odd tough bit, but overall it is worth it.  While the portions of curry and rice are roughly standard for an Indian takeaway (probably enough to feed you for two nights, if you compared the portion to a ready-meal) you get a big portion of pakora, served in a polystyrene box. The pakora, curry and rice was around 10 so not expensive either, given the quantity of food.  All in all I would recommend Saiyem's if you stay in the area.",

    "text": "I wasn't expecting too much from Saiyems when I first went there- the bright yellow exterior shouted - tacky- to me, but my friend who lives locally to the area insisted that their curries are great, and he was right. We ordered on a Wednesday night just before a Champions League game and so it was quite busy with other people having the same idea of watching the match over a curry. We waited inside the restaurant and it is a lot more quaint and respectable than the exterior, although that isn't hard.  I ordered a chicken bhuna with 2 papadums and a garlic naan bread, the prices here are pretty decent and for the quality and portions of food, it offers good value. The naan bread was one of the freshest I have had and not at all greasy, whilst the chicken bhuna was flavoursome and the chicken very fresh and tender.",
