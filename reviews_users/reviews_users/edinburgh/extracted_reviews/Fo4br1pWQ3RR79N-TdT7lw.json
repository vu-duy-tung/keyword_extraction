I had the spatched chicken with a delicious piri-piri sauce.  My bird came out hot and cooked just right, accompanied by a very good side of coleslaw. They also have 10 lunch specials Mon-Fri.",

We had the wings and Spatchcock chicken and both tasted great! I really liked the Garlic Ranch! Service wasn't the quickest but we were not in a hurry so it didn't worry us. Worth a visit if you're in the area debating what to eat. I would eat here again.",

When 11:00 finally rolled around, we were starving and a couple men came out and set up a sunroof thing. They set it up, then the rest went back inside. The last guy looked at us, didn't speak, the guy went back inside and locked the door. We waited there for another 10 minutes, and nothing. Finally left and went to another restaurant.",

The manager very rightfully comped our meal. While we appreciate the gesture of good will, we will not return.",

    "text": "This place is REALLY GOOD!! First off we went to their sister restaurant off the royal mile first called Burgers and Beers. There was a small wait so they suggested this place. It's like a 3 minute walk from B &B.  We ordered their wings, home made fries, an appetizer, and a kids meal. The wings are very good!! I don't even like wings, but these are so tasty!! Goes very well with their fries! Their fries almost look like wedges, but so very good. Their appetizer we ordered was their crusted green beans. OMG!!! They were the best I've ever tasted!!! Dipped in their ranch, it was B. O. M. B.  ORDER THESE, you won't regret it! The childs menu has some good choices. My daughter ordered their Mac and cheese. It was good. The decor in here was super cute- straight up Farmhouse style!! The service was good as well.  Eat here. You won't be disappointed.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Happened by Spatch while searching for a restaurant for a late lunch. The staff was super friendly and very attentive which was nice to see. I ended up ordering the Cluck Norris with a side of chips. Point one: it is huge, almost ridiculously so. It took me a second to figure out how I was going to eat it. When I finally did everything was falling off every bite. Pros: it's a lot of food, the chips were pretty good. Cons: it tasted under seasoned, like every individual component could have done with some salt and pepper. Also, the breading on the chicken was soggy and falling off with every bite. Once again, the staff was amazing but I feel like the taste of the food is fairly average.",

    "text": "I really didn't know what to make of spatch at first but once I read the menu online I knew I had to go!  But what to order?? Just a spatchcock chicken, the cluck Norris burger, Clint beastwood burger, Cheezus loves you?? Of course once I had stopped chuckling at the menu I settled on a cluck Norris, buffalo sauce and peanut butter milkshake.   Arriving you immediately smell the cooking chicken and it's rather like stepping into a dream if that's your thing.  I imagined myself as a character in an old cartoon when a wisp of a scent picks them up by the nose and they glide over to the dinner table.  The decor is becoming a fairly common look in Edinburgh, recycled pallets on he walls, funny artwork and rustic light fixtures.  Although I have seen this before at spatch you really believe you have walked through the finished front of a building into a shack constructed on the rear.  Anyway, the food!  Dear god, this redefined chicken burgers for me.  The bun is perfect, crispy lettuce and tasty mayo however all this pales in comparison to the main event. The chicken breast is huge, succulent, well seasoned and perfectly cooked.  Quite honestly the first one I had I picked up and totally forgot I had ordered a sauce.  On my second visit I took full advantage. I urge you to turn the burger on its side, pour buffalo sauce along the edge and then take the biggest bite you possibly can!  Repeat until your hands are empty!  I for one will be returning at every opportunity and at each attendance I will endeavour to explore the menu but I have a serious crush on a buffalo cluck Norris!",

Had the wings with a mixture of piri-piri and buffalo sauces and they were quite tasty.  Staff was very friendly as well (helped fix a shaky table we were at and stopped by several times to check on us).   I also ordered the BBQ beans (skip those, you don't get much but the waiter warned me in advance).    There's enough on the menu though that you shouldn't be disappointed.",

The beef rib portion was huge. The staff was real friendly and the place has a great ambiance. I really loved the leather bar seats. The strawberry mojito was excellent. Great place to sit and enjoy food with friends.",

We came in to ask about reservations for the evening and were told no reservations could be made, but front staff (Alicia and colleague whose name we failed to catch) was very friendly and accommodating. They joked around with us and recommended that we come back and ask for a table, and when we did they remembered us and were very friendly again. Waiter (Danny) and restaurant manager (Barry) were also very friendly and funny, they took our weird jokes and humor in stride and joked back easily. We ordered Nuclear Hot wings (11/10 spicy) and buffalo wings (more tolerable spice level and delicious). Shared a burger which was also wonderful, juicy and flavorful. Chips and sweet potato fries were fresh and hot. Ciders and beer were crisp and cool. We highly recommend this restaurant, do yourself a favorite and visit while you're in Edinburgh!",
