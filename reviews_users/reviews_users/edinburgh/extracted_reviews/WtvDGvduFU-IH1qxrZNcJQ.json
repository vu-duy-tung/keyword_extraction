I've found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. For example, the last time I went I ordered a curry that was far too spicy for my poor taste buds. The staff saw I was struggling and cooled me down with glasses of milk and by adding more coconut milk to my curry. It was much appreciated, especially since it was entirely my fault. In all this is a lovely wee place which is great for a weekend meal out, away from the crowds in some of the bar/restaurants in the area.",

    "text": "This is a loverly little Thai place, just off the Meadows in Edinburgh. I was starving the other night and in desperate search of food when I (happily)  stumbled across this place.  In a rush to fill my rumbling stomach, I boringly opted for a vegetable Thai Green Curry. It arrived so quickly and I could smell the fantastic aromas coming off the plate. The food looked really appealing and so I eagerly dove in to get started.   That's when I saw it. Slimy, beige tofu lurking in amongst the vegetables. My heart sunk a little bit as this point. I hate tofu - always have and probably always will. It's just weird, to be honest, and not something I especially look forward to eating. That being said, I did try a piece, in the hope that I would magically be converted to a tofu-lover. No such luck.  Now, I realise wholeheartedly that I cannot fault this place for serving me tofu that tasted like tofu - that would be crazy! I'm sure that in my desperation I completely missed the mention of it on the menu, so it was most likely my own fault, but I'm just putting it out there, to other tofu-haters: beware! If you don't like tofu, don't order tofu! :p  That being said, once I had carefully separated the tofu from the rest of the dish (trying desperately not to be spotted by the staff and be coined as that annoying, picky customer that everyone hates) the meal was really good! Just the right amount of spicy and nice flavours to top it off. It was pretty much your standard nice Thai curry. No real wow-factor, but a very satisfying meal nonetheless.  The atmosphere of the place is great too and the staff were really lovely! I'd definitely go back here. Maybe next time I'll simply avoid the tofu! :)",

But the prices were substantial, myself and my 5 year old son somehow managed a bill over 30.   I went here of a very quiet Saturday early evening, I think they had just opened for tea time. It was absolutely dead, I think there was myself and another couple in the entire restaurant.  The service was very considerate and attentive I couldn't fault them for that. Although with only 2 tables filled how else could they be. The food was definitely fresh and plentiful. Although in comparison to some other Thai places I have been to in the city, not a scratch on them.  Overall, it was just OK",

This was the last time I'll let my coat be taken, I accidently left my mobile phone in the pocket. It was stolen. Not by the staff because they had far too little interest in the whole thing to point the guilty finger at them. But, it was stolen by some girl with sunken cheeks and a kappa tracksuit. You know how I know? Because she'd stolen from there before and me and 50 other witnesses had to go testify against her in court. What a load of time wasting nonsense without even an apology.",

It was very busy the Thursday night I poped in, and seemed like many of the people there were enjoying the meal.    I would have left a 3 star review, on the average basis, except for one problem.  I ordered my food, and immediately a hot plate was brought for my food (within 30 seconds), my food followed in the next minute.  Panang curry.  There is no way that my food could have been made fresh to order in that time.    Yes I know Panang is a standard of Thai (I have been to Thailand), but when I order food from a restaurant, and am paying slightly higher than I know I should, it makes one feel cheated to know that you're food was made on mass quantity.  I spent more time waiting on my bill, than I did on waiting for my food.  I hate to be so picky about something, but I would rather have enjoyed finished munching on the crackers (which they took away when my food arrived.)",

There is a wide range of Thai dishes on the menu, with a substantial vegetarian section. They offer Thai Banquets, which have a set menu with a wide range of dishes on offer, and for a two course meal it costs 20 per person, not including drinks or desert.  I came here as a student with a friend and we were quite taken aback at the rather steep prices as we assumed that because the restaurant was in a student area, it would be relatively cheap. The meal itself was very tasty, I had the chicken in a red curry sauce and it was lovely and spicy, and I found the service attentive. I have not been back since purely because of the expensive nature of their menu but I would like to eat there again as the meal was very tasty, just maybe not at those prices.",

The portions are mahoosive, especially the starters and I had prawn fishcakes then a prawn noodle dish and both were lovely - really fresh, filling and well-presented. My date and I had to stifle a laugh when his sea bass was brought out, it was complete with cripsy head and tail. Nothing like chomping at something that still has its face in tact. They even offered to box up the leftovers for him. A crispy fish head doesn't quite have the same appeal as cold leftover pizza of a morning.  The staff were also great, really attentive without rushing us or being irritating.  Random comment - I also really liked the cutlery. And the fish tank built into the wall above the door to the loos.",

When we arrived, the restaurant was packed and we were led to a small convenient waiting area and brought drinks to tide us over.  This was a good touch.  When we were seated, we decided to go for a fixed three course menu.  I ordered prawns for my main and they were over cooked and rubbery, almost inedibly spicy, and not cleaned properly.  I have been really really really anal about prawns being properly cleaned ever since I was about 10 and my brothers explained that when my mum was de-veining the prawns, she was removing the poop shoot.  I am always always surprised and put off whenever I order prawns in a restaurant and they've not taken the time to do this, and I end up with gritty prawn poo in my dish.  Ok I know I'm kind of extreme with this, but, well, ew.  I think that, expecially for the cost of the food here, this is not a good representation of just how brilliant Thai food can be.",

My Edinburgh Thai restaurant of choice is the Thai Orchid on Johnston Terrace and it's so good that I've never needed to get my fix from anywhere else. I thought I should give this place a chance though, just in case I was missing out on something.   The restaurant is nicely lit and tastefully decorated, I'd describe it as understated Eastern: the walls are a gold colour and there's some bamboo and a tasteful Buddha. These are nice surroundings in which to have a meal, but there are no discerning features to speak of.  The service was very professional, I wouldn't describe it as friendly, but it was certainly efficient. The food was brought out in a timely manner and there was always a waiter on hand to replenish drinks and clear away plates.  The food itself was nice enough, but there was nothing that particularly stood out and I was intensely disappointed by the lack of Som Tam on the menu (this should be an obligatory item in every Thai restaurant).  The real shock of the evening came when we were presented with the bill - 70! This seemed to be a little steep for dinner for two with one bottle of wine, our meal was nice, but I would normally expect a bit more for that sort of price.",

Today we went to give the lunchtime deal a go (thought this would be perfect as we both knew we liked it and figured hey, the same but cheaper!) After a few awkward moments of scanning the set lunch deal menu I realised there were no vegetarian options included in the list. When the guy came over to take our order I asked if there were any other options and was told that I needed to order from the main menu. As a result my main dish alone (rice not included) cost more than my boyfriend's starter, main (with rice) and ice cream put together. Well I decided not to make a fuss there (perhaps I should) so I just went and ordered a red curry. Bit of waiting over and a green curry arrives. Tasty, but not what I ordered (admittedly there are only two vegetarian main course options  oyster sauce isn't vegetarian although they think it is  so it would have to be one or the other!) In short: expensive and if you're a veggie  don't even bother! Go to Thai Orchid in stead (cheaper, more choice and lo! veggie options on the set lunch menu!)",
