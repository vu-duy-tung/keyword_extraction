    "text": "It's been a few years since I've been to Karen's Unicorn but I'm pleased to report that it was still a 5 star experience for me. Best Chinese food I have eaten in Edinburgh.  This time round I had the 'War Tip' for starters, which is pan fried pork and vegetable dumplings. They were amazing, three little morsels of deliciousness accompanied by a vinegar dip. For main course I chose battered monk fish in ginger and spring onion sauce. When the food arrived, I thought the portion looked a bit on the small side but it was actually just perfect - not too much food (like often happens especially in Chinese restaurants) and not too little food. Everything was delicious.   There were plenty of staff hanging around and they were very attentive.   Expensive but good!",

    "text": "Reviewing a Chinese Restaurant is normally a bit same ol' same ol' - especially when it comes to many different dishes that are on offer and you are left wondering how they can cook all that with the same quality or without tasting similar - however Karen's Unicorn changed that notion for me.  Their menu is not extensive but has enough variety to warrant an extra few minutes to choose. There are 4 Set meal options available. And the a la carte has some nice twists on the usual Chinese Regional dishes.   I started with the hot & sour soup - very clearly home made and with good taste and fillings - in my opinion could have been hotter. My main course was a Beef Udon (I normally associate this with Japanese food but as a North China dish it was very well made, tasty and not too sweet  - however it did lack a bit on chili - which they very kindly provided on the side. My wife and my friend went for the shredded Peking Duck pancakes between them and it was expertly shredded at the table by our waitress.    I normally don't do dessert, but I didn't want this visit to be over so I ordered the fried banana in batter.. yum yum! finished with a coffee and brandy.   The place has managed one thing - I actually managed a conversation without having to comment on, service, draft or meal mishaps. All was done with a sense grace and minimalist invisible perfection.   Recommended",

    "text": "Now this is good Chinese food.   I've been waiting for a long time to find a place that compares to the quality I was used to in the SF bay area and this place delivered. Its definitely a bit more upscale and there were customs I have never experienced before in a Chinese restaurant (such as: warm towels between courses, tea candle food warmers) but I liked them.  Its been a long time since I had had a decent crispy chow mein dish so when I saw it on the menu I ordered it without thinking twice. The vegetable spring rolls were very light and fresh, not the standard oil drenched rolls you usually get. Overall very tasty food.   The place is a bit pricey but you get what you pay for. I do miss the wee hole in the walls with amazing Hong Kong style chow mein but this place certainly fills the void. Yes for a bit more cash but I would prefer that over the MSG coated noodles I'd be getting elsewhere.",

Hot and Sour soup is a must for me in every Chinese shop, such I know lots of variations. I can honestly say that the Hot and Sour Soup was delightful. Not to spicy and not too lame. You can always spice it up a bit if you like it HOT HOT HOT!  Main course: Peking Duck - Yummi. All fresh and tender. It melts in your mouth. Dessert: Honey Pot - my goodness, Heaven! Not more to say.......

    "text": "This restaurant is a new addition to my neighbourhood, the original branch in Stockbridge is a bit of an institution, so I thought I should check it out. It occupies the ground floor of a lovely new town building and the decorators have made it look clean and modern - there are no twee Chinoiserie fripperies here.  I was greeted as soon as I entered by a lovely, friendly young waiter (although I sound like one, I am not actually an OAP...) who gave me a take-away menu to look at and left me in peace whilst I made my choices. The food was ready pretty quickly and handed over with a smile and some free prawn crackers (nice one).  My starter of Salty and Spicy Squid was brilliant; the batter was crispy and light, the squid wasn't chewy or rubbery, and the balance of saltiness and spiciness was just right. For a main course I chose Kung Po Beef, it was a pretty average dish and not nearly as good as the squid (damn, that squid was tasty), I thought it would've been better if cooked with slightly less oil.  Although it's not a particularly cheap Chinese, it's not massively more expensive than your average take-away. I felt that 15 was a reasonable price for a starter, main, rice and prawn crackers and I'm sure I'll be back again soon.",

So, last night we toddled along after a couple of pints and had - a perfectly nice meal. Lovely staff, nice decor, everything very nice and ... you know, fine. It's basically a poshed up version of your bog standard British Chinese restaurant - sweet and sour, lemon chicken, spring rolls. All of them done to a higher standard than usual, but I'd have liked a few more interesting options.   So - I don't want to be negative because everything was very pleasant, but a little unexciting.",

In general appearance and ambience it's considerably more upmarket than your usual Chinese restaurant, and the prices reflect that. Mains are mostly around 10 (more for seafood), plus rice/noodles, and starters are around 5. I was a bit disappointed that the menu isn't very different from the typical Chinese offerings, but the quality was good. Not amazing, but noticeably different from the chopped mixed veg covered in radioactive goop that passes for Chinese food in too many UK eateries.  I think the simplest description of this place is an upmarket Chinese restaurant. I wouldn't say the food was particularly special, but it was all nice, well presented by attentive staff in pleasant surroundings. So if you like Chinese food but want more of a restaurant experience than your local takeaway, this is a good bet. But I feel that for these prices I would like something a little more interesting on the menu.",

It was standard Chinese takeaway fare served in surroundings that looked like a George Street cocktail bar instead of the usual waving cat tat you find in a lot of sit in establishments.

First, the ambiance with purple recess lighting is excellent.  It's definitely different from the red and gold decoration typical of a Chinese restaurant.  For starter, I had the delicious salty and spicy soft shell crab.  This is better than the usual salt and pepper prawns.  Its crunchiness is just right and the scallions complement the chilli nicely.  For the main course, I chose the beef filet cantonese style.  I prefer it drier, but the flavor is just right... not too sweet, not too tangy.  One star less for being on the pricey side.  I still can't consider it being fine dining even with the great ambiance and all.  And the service feels just average.  All and all, it's definitely on my list of favorites.",

It was back in April that I went here for lunch, and I think it was a new arrival on the scene because the place was heaving and the staff were only too eager to please. I'd be interested to see if it was like this a few months on.  I have no real complaints about the place, but it wasn't the best Chinese I have ever had. Lunch was 7.95 or 8.95 for 2 or 3 courses, pretty good value for money. My chicken noodle soup was nice, plenty of noodles and the broth was really tasty, if perhaps a little bit salty. We waited a while on our next course, maybe because the place was just finding its feet, but the staff apologised profusely for our wait so we didn't mind. I had a mixed veg chow mien which was fine, like I said, nothing outstanding, but I was absolutely starving by this point so I ate the lot.  We left full and satisfied but not particularly blown away, and we haven't felt the need to go back since. The name suggests something extra special but on this occasion, it didn't really deliver the goods.",
