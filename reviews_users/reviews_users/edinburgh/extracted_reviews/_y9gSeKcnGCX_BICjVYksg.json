    "text": "My wife and I didn't try the sweet pastries - willpower!!!  We DID get a pair of mushroom-and-Stilton (sort of mildish blue cheese that bakes nicely) pastries and a salad each and sat in the tiny dining area to enjoy them. The salads were fresh dressed with well-balanced and tasty balsamic vinegar-and-oil. The pastries were flaky with delicious mushroomy essence in the front completed by the cheese's creaminess and slight bite; the right order of things, imho. The coffee was delicious, a nice and relaxing ending after the savories and greens.   The store is tiny but attractive, with just a few seats. A lot of people, tourists and locals, floated through; some sat, others took their purchases with them to enjoy in the uncharacteristically beautiful, even hot, weather. The server was great, helpful and friendly; the owner even moreso. The place has been around for something like 34 years, apparently. We weren't suprised. Why wouldn't food and friendliness like this in a neighborhood like this stay around?  Might have to go back for something sweet.  Go there.",

    "text": "Keep an eye out for this place, if you blink you'll miss it!  I've been meaning to come to this place for some time now, and today I was finally drawn in by the lure of large mugs of coffee and a large that would satisfy any craving, whether sweet or savoury.   There are a few seats inside, but this is a very cosy place, you might not be so lucky to nab a seat on a busy day, but never fear- there's always takeaway!  Good coffee, decent food (my roast beef and caramelised onion toastie could have done with more seasoning and more cheese!) but I'm being kind to this place because the service was great and I think once they find their feet it'll improve.   Certainly worth stopping in for a coffee and having a chat with the lovely staff, or just to get away from the business of Stockbridge.",

I had tea and their chicken rice and vegetable soup while my husband had the steak pie with mashed potatoes and peas. Both were heavenly and we love that we found this gem right down the street from us. If you're in Stockbridge, this place is a must visit.",

This place is small but beautifully decorated and the chef-owner is a lovely woman who likes to come out and greet each guest. Leave a little bit of room for dessert because it is amazing too. We walked to Stockbridge on the advice of our cabbie from he train station and he was right, totally worth the walk. I didn't get to try the soup or other items on the small but incredible menu but if I don't come back to Edinburgh for anything else it will be to eat here. Get there early because it isn't open late!",
