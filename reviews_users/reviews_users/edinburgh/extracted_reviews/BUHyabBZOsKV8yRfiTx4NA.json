    "text": "Could do better. Should do better... PLEASE do better JBaB!   I really really wanted to love this place. All very impressive upon entry with excellent music playing, gorgeous timber effect wall paper and a industrial but clean decor.   The 'build a burger' option is great. If you don't see something on the varied and eclectic burger menu that tickles your fancy, there's a step by step process for selecting bun, patty, cheese, big extra and little extra to tailor your ideal burg. Our burgers were juicy and flavoursome but mine was let down by the extras I picked. The jalapenos were missed out and I felt short changed on the amount of pulled pork on my bun.  It took a while to attract attention of the staff so I had already eaten half my burger by the time the jalapenos were brought out.   The price on the menu is just for the burger (as the name suggests). For around the 10 mark charged, I would expect sides to be included. The curly fries were tasty but no different to any frozen curly fry from any pub anywhere. I really wanted to delight in the macaroni cheese burger but it just didn't really taste of much apart from fried white carbs.   The beer selection by the bottle is great- loads of interesting things to choose from although the menu would benefit from descriptions so that you can make a better guess at liking what you're getting. Eye wateringly expensive though.   Overall, a good idea but prohibitively overpriced and not up to scratch in comparison to the rest of the burgeoning burger scene in Edinburgh.",

The burger was ok, but there was a certain lack of flavour about the meat and I'm not sure all of the components came together (I had the Dirty South) that well. The fries were just warm enough.   The beer list was extensive, but damn expensive! Also a huge proportion were sold out.   Service was friendly enough, but we had to ask for further drinks orders to be taken, and while it's never nice to be pestered, you do like to be asked periodically.   Here's a caveat - this was a visit in August and there were 25 of us and while those two things combined may contribute to a reduced experience, it shouldn't really effect a place situated on the Royal Mile - it's not like they didn't know it would be busy.   Edinburgh has some brilliant burger options (Burger, Red Squirrel to name two) and I'll not be rushing back here to give it another go. Sorry!",

There may only be a couple of tables on the sidewalk and maybe four more in the front room but when you walk past the kitchen a large room of twenty or more tables presents.  Turns out to be a great place to have a lunch or dinner.  Bring the family.  Great burgers and fries!  A very imaginative menu-from quintessential American burgers to burgers for all tastes.  The burgers are a 10-the fries are a 10.  It is absolutely a fine place to eat-the music selection is even incredible.  Then there is the beer-a great selection of beers from around the world-mostly bottled but some are great craft beers.  They also have draft beer but nothing that did it for me.  They did not have Rouge!!! Other than the lack of Rouge 7 hop the place is excellent!!",

The milkshakes are definitely 'milk' shakes and I couldn't tell if it contained ice cream, if you want a thick shake this is not the place to get it! Limited choice of flavours 4 on the menu and no peanut butter and a super steep price of 4.50 for the size. When ordering we were told they had ONE piece of chicken left due to a busy Saturday and a late Sunday delivery so burgers were made either with a beef or veg patty option (don't expect to be asked how rare you want the beef). I ordered \"the dirty south\" burger with the vege patty but on delivery of the burger it contained no pork as per the menu, so that had to go back.  The battered onion rings and gherkins were thick and voluminous, being slightly greasy and would be better suited to a thinner, crispier coating. Lots of apologies from staff and no discount for the trouble. 20 for lunch was a bit steep, all things considered.",

We are from the US, so we expect that there will be some differences in how local foods taste.  Overall, we had some excellent food on our trip to Scotland. This wasn't one of those meals. The reason I'm reviewing is because I think this place has the potential to be a really good pub.  I actually liked everything but the burger. I had a burger with bacon, egg and a fried hash brown potato.  The bacon and hash browns were really tasty.  The fries were fine. The bun was good. The really big problem was the meat. It was heavily dosed with black pepper. So much pepper that you couldn't taste anything else. It just overpowered the whole burger, and made it almost inedible. I was starved so I ate most of it anyway, at least until I wasn't so hungry. Once I wasn't so hungry, I couldn't eat anymore because the taste was so bad.  It's a shame because it had the makings of a really good burger, but ruined by bad seasoning.",

    "text": "SCAMMERS AND THIEVES. TOURIST BEWARE AND AVOID!!!   Sorry for the lengthy post but you have to know what goes on here so you don't lose your money.  I stopped by and ate here. Wait time was decent but here is why these people are scumbags and thieves. I am a tourist and after I paid and they gave me back my change, I had noticed that they gave me bills that were no longer in circulation (meaning that no one will accept them because the country changed their money a few years back). I told the thief (the lady with the horrible dyed blue hair) that I cannot accept these bills because they are no longer valid and in circulation and nowhere else will accept them either. She told me that she cannot open her register until there is another customer. There was no else that was waiting behind me to order or pay but that there is a bank not far from the there where I can try and change the bills. So now she wants to turn it into my problem! **Just a heads up, banks will NOT swap outdated bills here unless you have an account open with them which I'm assuming most tourist do not.** I told her that I need  bills that can be accepted and then she said that she can grab a manager to see \"what they can do\". She comes back without a manager but with a key card and opens the register and says that she can now only give me my change in coins even though I'm seeing the drawer filled with bills. Two of those coins (which they call 'Pounds' over here - equivalent to an American dollar) were no longer in circulation. Unfortunately I didn't catch that as I was only aware of the bad bills so they still ended up ripping me off of some change in the end.   These people are total scumbags and they know better but still take advantage of their unsuspecting tourist customers. At least I caught the invalid bills that they were trying to pass off which I'm sure THEY would not have accepted as payment if I tried to pay them using those same bills. Now they will probably reply that this was an accident and blah blah blah but this was no accident. These people know the system are just basically washing money and ripping unsuspecting tourist off. Pass this place up as their are plenty of other delicious and most importantly, honest places to eat.  Shame on you burgers and beers.",

    "text": "The burger trend marches on apace in Edinburgh. Rather glad I decided to check out Just Burgers and Beer.  We ventured in hungry on a Saturday afternoon - made the wise move of skipping breakfast that morning. Hankering for my usual eggs, my eyes boggled at a burger on the menu called The Brinner - bacon, hash brown and a fried egg on a burger. I loved the addition of sauteed onions, which added just a smidge of sweetness. In spite of the song and dance of all the additional toppings the taste of the burger itself still came through well (unless some places I won't name - yet!).  One of my dining companions opted for the Mac Attack which had a whole burger made of macaroni cheese, nestled on top of the beef burger - wowza!  Everything was tasty and enjoyed, even the lovely crisp fries (even if they were served in a wee bucket - eh?) and I've been back a couple of times since. The build your own burger feature is quite good too, and I'm trying to hone in on my perfect burger - watch this space...",

    "text": "I started this draft after waiting an hour and twenty minutes for my burger (and twenty minutes for my drink beforehand). I've no idea how m burger could take so long to prepare even though we'd rocked up with a group of 14 (the place is set over two floors and was not crowded). I eventually ate my okay burger and not-quite crispy enough chips and got the hell out of there.  Amongst our group, there were several instances of orders being taken incorrectly, the wait staff having to walk around each upstairs table trying to work out who'd previously ordered what, leading to a really amateurish showing from the staff there.  As a backpacker, I liked that they had Wifi and Powerpoints so you could charge your phone (even advertising that fact on the menus), and it's not like the food was terrible, but there is no way I'll find myself turning to Burgers and Beers Grillhouse. They really need to get someone in there to train their staff.",

    "text": "I had never been to Burgers & Beers before today. I very much doubt i'll be back.  That sentence makes me quite sad, as it's a decent space (love all the wood details), the beer list (though expensive) lists some tried and True favourites and the sweet potato fries were tasty enough as a \"tide over\" snack. But today, the service left me with too much of a bad taste in my mouth to make me lean this direction again.  I come from a service industry background. This makes me both incredibly critical and incredibly sympathetic. I'll let someone get away with murder when they are obviously in the weeds, but I also have no patience when there doesn't seem to be a reason for poor service. Consider this my critical side.  We got seated quickly and the place was half full when we arrived... not busy but we weren't the only folks in the room. The gal serving us seemed to have about five tables to wait on in total. So we were seating... and then we waited.... and waited.... and waited. I'm a firm believer that the first drink should hit the table within 7 minutes of sitting down. We weren't approached for a drink order until at least the ten minute mark.  Once we ordered our two beers and sweet potato fries (an order that got an audible tisk from our server... I get it, it wasn't a full meal but the place was not busy and regardless, don't tisk someone AT THE TABLE!) we waited... and we waited... and we waited. The table next to us that was seated after received their drinks... and we waited. After another good 10-15 minutes, our beers came to the table. They were in bottles. I had assumed because of the delay that they might have been changing the kegs, but nope... bottles. It took 15 minutes to open bottles.   ???  The fries came pretty quickly thereafter, though the table next to us received their meals first once again. Like I said, they were tasty, but at that point, they had lost me already.  The sad part was, we would have happily taken down a second beer while we sat there chatting. Instead, we spend a strange hour looking over our shoulder, waiting for things to arrive. I would have even given this place a half nod if our server actually acknowledged the fact it took the better part of a half hour to get TWO bottles of beer to the table... but nope.   It was enough of a headache for me to look elsewhere next time i'm in the area.",

The staff were friendly and let us all dressed as zombies chill in the front of the bar.   Not something I would go out of my way for but I wouldn't complain there. I will check out the burgers and update this in the future!",

    "text": "My mum and I stopped in here for a snack one night and its was so good we came back for a full meal the next night. We got the chicken skewers and onion rings, as well as different burgers. The chicken skewers were had red peppers with them and came with a piri-piri sauce was that so spicy, but it was a good spicy. The onion rings were lightly battered and flaky, which I enjoy with my onion rings, so I thought they were very good. If you like a thicker battered onion ring, maybe don't get them here.   Now, for the burger. I am a big fan of cheese burgers, and I fell in love with the burger. The whole restaurant has an American theme to it, they play classic American hits and named all of their burgers after American icons.  I got the Johnny Cash, with goat cheese and sauteed red onions and fries. The burger was rich with flavor and so much melted cheese, I was in burger heaven. I would totally reccomend this place to anyone who just wants a something simple like burger and doesn't want to go a pub on the Royal Mile, this a good place with good beer and good burgers.",

    "text": "BURGER QUEST CONTINUES, and I want to score these guys higher, I really do. There are plenty of reasons to justify why Burgers and Beers Grillhouse might get a high 4, or even 5 stars...  Their ideas are great. The menu boasts some excellent combos, from the Mac Attack with its mac 'n' cheese fritter and Virginia sweet cured bacon, to the Brinner with its fried egg and hash brown; even the option of a focaccia or white glazed bun instead of the now-standard brioche adds a touch of individuality.  The staff are on their game. Friendly, knowledgeable, up for some banter and - most importantly - informal.   The quality is high. I chose the Marcellus Wallace: an 8oz beef patty, Virginia sweet cured bacon, peanut butter, lettuce, tomato, Monterey jack cheese, onion & buffalo hot sauce, and served on a seeded brioche bun. It rocked. Could've had more peanut butter (but what couldn't, right?) and the bun was a little big for the patty, but the flavours were great. The peanut butter and the buffalo sauce really taking charge throughout. The fries and sweet potato fries were crispy and nice, pretty standard, but no less enjoyable.  The place has space. The decor is certainly on trend with a lot of the burger joints permeating the country - bricks and chains and cages, all in a historical building setting (it's on the Royal Mile!) had shades of the Boozy Cow about it, or even Meat Mission in London. Plenty of tables inside and out and even a bar area, with a decent range of beverages, both alcoholic and not, for those who are willing to wait.  So why doesn't Burgers and Beers Grillhouse score a 4 or 5 from me? Well, sit back, friend, I'll tell you.  It would take some kind of fool not to notice the recent resurgence of the burger joint in Edinburgh. And long may it continue. We have loads. A craze started by the likes of Holyrood 9A, Lebowski's and Bar Kohl (may she rest in peace!) but more recently embraced by newer businesses, such as Burger, BMB, the Boozy Cow, who claim to SPECIALISE in burgers.  The problem with these latter examples is that, unlike the gastro pubs that preceded them, when you look at their delightful list of sandwiches, the price you see next to the burger is for the burger. Just the burger. That's it. No longer are fries and a slaw included in the cost on the menu, no, now you need to order those supplements as a side and pay the associated costs thereof.  Anyone who has read my reviews of Burger and BMB will know I have an issue with this. Fries should be included in the price of the burger. End of. It's a British institution and long may it reign! Anyone who has read my reviews of Burger and BMB will ALSO know that I score Burger higher on the grounds that, for the same quality of sandwich, they are decidedly cheaper.  And this is where Burgers and Beers Grillhouse fails.  A monthly special at Burger, the sandwich alone will set you back about 7.99. Without chips. At BMB, the weekly special costs about 2 more, sitting at a penny shy of a tenner. Without chips.  At B&B Grillhouse they don't have specials (some would argue they are ALL special), but in the realms of burger creation, I would deem my Marcellus Wallace to be just that: a bespoke-designed burger, the standard of which competes quite capably alongside that which is produced by Burger, BMB, the Boozy Cow et al...   The Marcellus Wallace cost me 12.99.  Without chips.  This, my friends, is not on.  When three burgers and two fries to share costs a grand total of 60 - with no alcohol - this is not on. This is a prime example of paying for location. And I live in Edinburgh, and I see the Royal Mile every day. So why am I paying for their post code?  For these prices I wouldn't even be back if it was the best burger I'd ever had (alas that honour still resides in Berlin). And I didn't even mention the beer prices - 5 for a pint of Heineken. Heineken!? Who makes this stuff up!?  Be warned, friends. Save a fiver and get just as good from elsewhere.... it's not like we're short of options!!",
