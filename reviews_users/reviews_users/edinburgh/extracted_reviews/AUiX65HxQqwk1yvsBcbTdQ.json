    "text": "So, being from the US and not the UK, I have to compare this experience with food that I am accustomed to as well as other food in the UK. But, I do try to have an open mind. Overall, it was one of the better meals so far in the country (had a pretty mediocre experience so far in the UK) but it did not meet better-than-average food standards that I am familiar with....OK, I say all of this cause I know this may not be a fair assessment and it sounds like I'm an Ameri-snob but that is what I'm working with....  We were staying near the Royal MIle and had passed by this place on a few walks. Decided to head out to have lunch there. Upon arriving, it was raining (outdoor seating closed) so we were immediately led to the back dining room. A very pleasant, modern space with a wall of glass on one side. Waiter came within a few minutes and got a drink order and an orange juice / seltzer mix for the kids.  My wife got a pink froo-froo drink that came in a Martini glass and didn't like it (as usual). I tried it and it was OK...just not her thing. She switched to wine. I got a Hendricks Negroni which was really good and stout if you like bitters.   Thing 1 and Thing 2 ordered kids penne pasta (not on the menu)....one with just butter and one with a red sauce. Red sauce was a bit weak and flavorless. Wife and I shared a scallop app that was pretty good...had a salad with cilantro and a mayo-based sauce on the side.   Then came the main courses....wife got the salmon med rare and I got the fish and chips. Salmon was reported as just OK and fish and chips were good except for that English tradition of serving things with mushy peas underneath them. Not too bad of an idea, and I don't have anything against peas, but the they need to have some flavor so that they enhance the dish and this wasn't the case. A bit bland. Tartar sauce accompanying my dish as well as the \"chips\" were tasty. The presentation was very nice here.   Check was 120 pounds which seemed very steep (hmm....is this about $200 USD!!!! ouch). But, very good service. I would say that there are many other places to eat in this town....I will have to try a few more before I can compare this with other options in the area. Probably won't be back here on this trip.",

We saw many people try to come in but they were full with reservations all night. We got a goat cheese appetizer which was amazing with apples & beets! We split chateaubriand with green beans, potatoes & rocket salad.... it was wonderful! The waitress was so attentive & pleasant as well! we had a wonderful time so happy we found this place!!!!",

    "text": "After going to many restaurants this past week, I'd have to say this spot was Alright.   I think overall its just because I seem to have made the bad choice on the menu! I ordered Fish with Squid and some sort of chorizo risotto underneath. I have to say the dish was so salty I was considering taking it back. The other dinners were nice, all the presentation is well done and the staff were really kind. Although this choice that I made put me off, especially because the prices are pretty high.   For a starter my dad and I shared a goats cheese and beetroot ensemble. It was very delicious and the presentation was cool enough that my family and I want to re-create it at home.   The prices are high, the service and ambiance is nice, however I just don't think I'd rush back ASAP.",

    "text": "I had one of the more adventurous meals of my life at Angels with Bagpipes last week, and it was excellent.   As we were on vacation, we decided to treat ourselves to a more upscale and pricey meal, and it was worth every penny. We had a late reservation, and our table wasn't quite ready when we arrived, so we decided to enjoy a cocktail in the front bar area and peruse the menu. It's not a huge menu by any means, but it is an interesting one, so we had a difficult enough time deciding what we'd like to order. What was nice was that we were able to order prior to being seated at our table, so that we wouldn't have to wait ages for our food. (Details like that are what make some restaurant experiences great, instead of merely good.)  My cocktail (a chocolate/orange/espresso combination) was tasty, but I switched to wine with my food. My husband loved his gin and tonic, though, and stuck with that for the evening. I started with the beef tartare (a first for me), and it was amazing. I even enjoyed the raw quail's egg on top, and I generally have an issue with even somewhat runny eggs. Honestly, this dish was so good, I would've considered having it again for dessert! My husband had the haggis, which he really enjoyed, especially as it was wrapped in bacon. (I didn't get a bite, but I've had haggis before, so I wasn't too disappointed.) For mains, I had the trout, and again, it was very good - I particularly enjoyed the crab \"fish stick\" that accompanied it. My husband had the lamb, and here's where I got super adventurous, as it came with sweetbread and tongue, both of which I tried (another first), and coming from someone who SWORE they would never eat any kind of organ meat, I really liked both. The tongue in particular was very tender and flavorful. I don't know that I would be brave enough to eat an entire entree, but the bites I had were very enjoyable, and my husband said he'd happily order this again. He also got a side of chips, which were good, but not entirely necessary.  For dessert we decided to split the cheese plate, and it is more than big enough to share, with 5 different cheese on offer, including a fantastic goat cheese. The pear chutney was a wonderful accompaniment, and really, it was a perfect end to a perfect meal.  The restaurant isn't terribly fancy or pretentious - it's more of a place where you can dress up if you'd like to, but I felt comfortable enough in nice jeans and a sparkly top. The upstairs dining area can get a bit loud, especially if there are any large groups having dinner, but it didn't detract from our experience at all. Service, especially in the bar area, is friendly and top notch, and the food is all presented beautifully. Portions aren't huge, but everything is of the best quality and we certainly didn't leave hungry.   We had a great night and a fantastic meal, and I would definitely go back to Angels with Bagpipes if I'm ever in Edinburgh again.",

The sides of mashed carrots and greens were different and excellent. I particularly appreciated the very light dressing on the greens. We capped it off with a quite imaginative desert. The Romanian wine was very nice, the first glass we have ever encountered, anywhere. Finally, the service was exceptional. Enjoy!",

    "text": "This place is my #1 favorite restaurant in Edinburgh. It was recommended by our hotel staff. We didn't have the chance to come here until the end of our trip. We wish we learned more about this place sooner because it was one of the best restaurants we've gone to. Everything was just exceptional! We were seated immediately when we came here. I've always wanted to try the haggis but didn't had the courage but something about this place finally made me try it. We ordered their haggis, neeps and tattis as an appetizer and it was very good. It was served it a very nice fashion. Not only the appetizer but everything else we ordered were served very nicely. My boyfriend and I couldn't decide between their lamb and venison so we decided to order one of each and shared. They were both very delicious. Good meat cooked to perfection as I almost licked my plate. We also decided to try some whisky. We didn't know what to order but our waiter helped us picked the best one they have. We didn't know how to drink it so he taught us how to add little drops of water into the whisky and drink it very slowly. We felt like dummy amateurs when it comes to whisky but our waiter was just so sweet, nice and kind. This place has very nice ambiance (not to mention very romantic), very good location (just around the corner from our hotel), exceptional food and service and reasonable price. I also like the restaurant's name Angels with Bagpipes.",

    "text": "Angels with Bagpipes was recommended by the concierge of our colleague's hotel. Happily for us they even had a table available.  This is not a cheap restaurant, but we were being treated, so price wasn't an issue. Pretty much everything we had was great. The soup -- celeriac cream, foie gras & crouton -- was mild but lovely, the haggis -- my first time -- was surprisingly tasty, and my husband's beef tartare was one of the best I've tasted.  For mains, I got the lamb and my husband had the risotto. The lamb was perfectly medium rare, as ordered, and very flavourful. The polenta balls were great, but the peas and broad beans were a little overcooked -- starchier than I like. The risotto was quite nice; the mushrooms were particularly well prepared.  For dessert, I had the fig tart, which was good, but not spectacular. The vanilla ice cream was quite good, but the crust and custard were just okay and the tobacco syrup was disappointing -- just tasted like corn syrup to me. However, our colleague had the cheese platter, which was quite generous in quantity and had a nice variety of soft and hard selections. Definitely enough to share.  Servers were courteous and helpful, and when my husband spilled my port right after it had been served, they kindly refilled my glass on the house. We closed the place out, but the servers did a good job of not making us feel rushed. Our colleague, who knows more about these things than we do, seemed pleased with the wine list, as well.  All in all, we had a wonderful meal, and I would be very happy to return to try more of the menu (and get my own beef tartare!). Not quite 5 stars, but definitely 4.5.",

The staff are lovely and friendly. They are very polite and go out of their way to accommodate you, but without being over the top.  The menu is mouthwatering and did not disappoint. I had a smoked salmon starter. The attention to detail was spot on. The piece of salmon was nice and chunky and garnished with bits of caviar, radishes, etc. Beautiful.  For my main course I unusually (not a big meat eater) went for the lamb. It was cooked beautifully and was really tasty.  Although I was pretty stuffed, I still managed to squeeze in a dessert of a chocolate orange mousse. It was nice but would have been nicer if it was a bit lighter. A bit too rich after the other courses.  My only criticism would be that it was a bit chilly in there. Apart from that it was a nice, relaxing environment, friendly and down to earth staff, and the food was delicious. I wouldn't go here all the time, but it is nice for a special occasion :)",

For dessert, we got the ginger honey pear cheesecake, the chocolate brownie with miso ice cream and the tonka bean parfait with green apple sorbet. These desserts were so unique in their components and I would have never guessed that they would have been as delectable as they were. I also had several bottles of the Thistly Cross Cider and it was one of the better Scottish ciders I had tried.

Eventually a third person was able to locate it (he was, possibly, the manager). We then sat for almost ten minutes before any waitstaff came to our table (despite the fact that we were seated right next to the hostess' stand). From that point on, we would describe the waitstaff as \"inattentive\", at best. The food was good - we had the tasting menu - but the service was really pretty bad. Unfortunately we cannot recommend this restaurant.",

We weren't prepared for the atmosphere and totally stood out like tourists. But, we were so anxious for a good meal because we hadn't found one yet.  The service was impeccable and we didn't feel a hint of disdain at our shorts and tennis shoes attire (whoops - like I said, unprepared).  We ordered olives, bread and olive oil as an appetizer. I had the pork belly, which I think I remember being served with potatoes and greens. No matter, the pork belly was the focal point and it was just perfect. My husband ordered the ribeye with and to date, he still describes it as the best steak he's ever had in his life.  We didn't do dessert, because we headed across the street for a fried Mars Bar. How could we not?",

I'm sure there is more seating here if you were to take the stairs behind our table, but from a first glance, there weren't many tables.  The lunch menu offered three courses, with the lunch special being a choice of two.  Many in my party ordered (and enjoyed) the mussel appetizer.  I chose an entree (beef with creamed potatoes, leek and truffle oil) and dessert (Chocolate mousse with white chocolate sorbet and Seville orange gelee).  The menu wording weren't quite as descriptive as mine, but I rolled the dice.  The beef was more like a pot roast, quite marbled with fat.  I really dislike red meat that isn't on the leaner side, so the beef wasn't for me.  I ate the remainder of the entree, combining the potato, leek, and sauce and actually rather enjoyed it.  My dessert, however, was to die for!  Not too heavy, but still so decadent, and the seville orange gelee was the perfect addition to the chocolates!  I couldn't get enough!",

They apparently play a keen game of \"where did you fit in our restaurant\" and will either reward you with a seat in their one good dining room, or down a notch and put you in their adequate room, or stick you next to their station where they can make you feel perfectly miserable about dinner so that you will leave quickly. One poor family even fell below that, and got dispatched to a table outside in the cold Edinburgh weather. Not even sure why they stayed, and it was clear to all what was happening. Chef needs to take her/his skills to one of the other hundreds of restaurants in town where the staff appreciates guests and their revenue. So many excellent restaurants nearby, pass in this one and save yourself the trouble.",

The host was very friendly and gave us a nice selection of non-reserved seats so we sat in the lower dining room. Very beautiful room with a lovely ambiance. The server was also quite friendly and made a good wine pairing suggesting for my wife's duck main. She started with the haggis and it was very delicious! So many people were asking if we were going to try haggis while we're over here. We've had it all three days we've been here so far. I ordered the lamb - which I've been excited for since we decided to visit Scotland - and it was also really tasty. Her duck dish though was better, served with beets and some asparagus, it was great. I do wish the portion sizes were slightly  bigger. Dessert choices were the panna cotta and ginger cheesecake. Both were great ways to cap the meal.   They do have tasting menus which I would try if we go back. They offer a 4 or 6 course menu and the option of having it paired with wine. It would be worth it.",

    "text": "I slowly opened one eye, and then the other, I checked all major body parts...everything was still there and moving. I lifted my head off the pillow, that's when I realised I had a very dry mouth and a gentle pounding in my head, it was time to get to the kitchen...must...drink....tea.  So now you know how the evening ended, it's time to go back to the start.  My dining partner in crime (DPIC) and I had decided on Angels with Bagpipes as the venue for a celebratory meal. We arrived to be shown promptly to our table by the friendly staff who immediately made us feel welcome and offered any help with questions while we perused the menu.   We were seated in the back area which reminded me of a friends living room that has impeccable taste in interior decor. It was relaxed yet with the perfect balance of formal and informal that makes you feel like you're somewhere special but not that you can't relax and enjoy yourself.  It didn't take long for us to make our dining decisions, we chose the Chateau Ka wine from Lebanon after a recommendation from my DPIC and we were not disappointed at all. I went for the Orkney Scallops with lentils, apple, caramel and crackling as I was intrigued by the combination of flavours for a starter and being a fan of a classic steak chose that for mains.  The scallops were tender and fresh, and the lentils added a wonderful texture perfectly balancing the sweetness of the apple and caramel, the crackling added a lovely 'bite' and it was beautifully presented. The steak was perfectly done to order, however the pesto tomato was a little over loaded with pesto but a small complaint given when you order steak it's the meat that's the star.  My DPIC ordered the beef tartare, and after stealing a fork full I can confirm it tasted wonderful with a wonderful crisp fresh crunch from the onions. For her main she ordered the lamb which was again perfectly cooked but she felt there was a little too much 'going on' with the sweetbread, anchovy and almond garnish. We're both of the opinion when it comes to a meat dish, less is more but this is personal opinion after all.  We decided to finish off the evening with a shared cheese board and some port, the staff again demonstrated their knowledge by walking us through the cheeses on the board and informing us they were displayed from mild to strong across the board. We ordered the Fonseca 97 Port as my DPIC informed me she still dreamt about the port from when she'd been in 2010. And it was everything it was built up to be, so we had a second glass just to be able to savour it a little longer.   The cheese was a good mix of hard and soft, and whilst we're both cheese fiends we didn't find the strongest one over powering and we easily polished them all off as the portion sizes were just right.  Overall we had a lovely evening there, I'd recommend this venue for special occasions with friends, romantic dinners or if you have friends from out of town staying. Make sure your guests spot the Angel with Bagpipes statue which the restaurant is named after, her whistful expression makes me think she also might be thinking of the glass of port and cheese she's going to have at the end of her shift.  Oh, and in case you're wondering. I can highly recommend the Jolly Roger and Monteiths and the Albanach for post dinner drinks. Probably just don't do them all in one night, otherwise you'll end up how I started this review!",

Given the reputation given below that this place can be expensive this was a pleasant surprise.  Looking at the fixed price menu there was something for everyone but for me starter wise there was only one option, smoked ham terrine with a fois gras centre served with a quail egg and a tweel. Light tasty and delicious! The dish was technical, elegant and just outstanding. The fois gras was a great treat on a beautiful day.  For main I opted for the short rib of beef, served with potatoes, salsify, spinach and a gravy that was incredible the dish worked fantastically well. I gobbled it all up in no time and was left very content.  The service was perfect, the beer was cold...I was very happy.  Even more keen to visit for dinner now but the lunch menu here comes highly JD Recommended!",

From the posh atmosphere, the exquisitely plated food, the gracious service, seriously everything.  A prix fixe menu will keep costs down significantly . Though I went on one night and had a lovely dinner for two with wine and a shared dessert for less than 60.  Side note: there is a slippery spot in the back room that I hope they've polished over by now. Three woman slipped on it during brunch, me being one of them. One minute you're enjoying toast, and the next your skirt's flown up and you've flashed everyone the goods.  Still not enough to sour a great experience, haha.",

Food is amazing, so well made and the atmosphere here is great - caters for all groups well. On my first visit I was dubious as there were a large group of hens- they didn't ruin the atmosphere (even though it's a small-ish restaurant), waiters were really attentive. A friend knew we were visiting and had pre-ordered a bottle of prosecco for us which was a really nice surprise! It's nice to visit for a romantic dinner or with friends.   The service is great - such a pleasure dining here, and there's something for everyone on the menu.. Just wish the deserts were't so damn tasty!",

Next time I will try to book that table.  Where I sat was not so nice - right by the front door and being mid December they were hosting multiple christmas parties for companies so large groups of people were coming through the doors and being a polite bunch they kept the doors open for the next person - even if they were on the other side of the street..... Making it nice and freezing for myself and the wife! I mean really, it was like a gale wind coming in.   Why do restaurants have tables right by the doors - so close in face I could have probably held it open for them with a little stretch of the arm! It's not like they were short for space, they have 2 floors and many tables.   Oh well - I'll get the private table next time hopefully.",

From the first meal, the haggis appetizer was our first introduction to the dish, and was a great balance of the richness of the offal with the spice. The rabbit dish was a surprise in presentation as a stuffed roll, but expertly cooked and tender. The seasoning on the barley was rich and delicious as well, with wonderful sauces to accompany.   Our second meal, I loved the minty \"salsa verde\" on the potato terrine beside the lamb, perfectly cooked to rare and tender. The parfait dessert was light with punches of oat, raspberry, and whiskey flavor, an upscale version of the Scottish dessert cranachan I believe.  Both times, we had the greatest service by Cecily. Her cheery demeanor was a joy in helping us make our decisions on the menu. She really conveyed an enthusiasm for the food and restaurant that added a lot to the experience. Cecily immediately recognized us on our second visit with a warm welcome that confirmed that we had made the right choice in coming back!  Easily my favorite restaurant in Edinburgh. Head and shoulders over other steakhouse/seafood restaurants at similar price point we had tried.",

    "text": "Angels with bagpipes? If angels really did play bagpipes...infer what you will.  As a modern Scottish eatery, this is a gem.  Hidden in plain sight, right on the Royal Mile.  Traditional Scottish food elevated using the freshest obtainable ingredients served in a contemporary, multi story building overlooking centuries old courtyard.  The menu is seasonal. Autumn 2015, for starters, the potato and leek soup with a poached egg and croutons is outstanding. Creamy, the vibrant flavor of the leaks mellowed ever so slightly when you break the egg open. The scallop with black pudding, and unexpected joy to eat. Tart green apple puree provides the base for beautifully seared, incredibly sweet scallop. The accompanying black pudding has been deep fried in bacon fat rendering it crispy.  Barely a hint that it's a blood sausage. Crisp streaky bacon adds even more Porky goodness. Some bitter greens rounds out the extremely well balanced, textually satisfying dish.  For mains, it's hard to pass on the selection of fish. All combine intriguing flavors of produce that miraculously heightens the flavor of the fish. The salmon cooked mid rare is extremely rich. The crispy skin adds a brilliant foil. The use of a red pepper puree heightens the natural sweetness, bitter greens accentuate the fatty flavor.  The natural flavors of a simply pan roasted, perfectly cooked, moist and fatty, black cod are greatly heightened by the earthiness of grilled onions sauteed wild mushrooms and a root vegetable puree.  For something vegetarian, try the mushroom mouse served with grilled mushrooms and sauteed root veg, sauced with beet root puree is wonderful.  Solidified mushroom soup!  Extremely silky, velvety, intense flavor of mushroom from the mouse combines perfectly with the bitterness of the grilled mushrooms. The sweetness of the beet puree ties the entire dish together.  Very well chosen wine list at reasonable prices.  Average bottle 20.  Very friendly and efficient service.   One month advance booking required.   Them angels can play bagpipes all they want if I can eat like this.",

    "text": "The first thing you realize is that angels playing bagpipes would be quite the outsiders. While the other heavenly beings are composing etudes on their celestial harps, these rebels are making a scene while making music you can hear from miles away. As someone who has an affinity for people (and demigods) who follow their own path, I like these angels. And I can safely say Angels with Bagpipes is a restaurant that stands alone when it comes to outstanding service and impressive food.  Three of us walked in on a Friday night with a reservation made weeks in advance, and at first it looked like we may not have needed it. From the street, this looks like a small place with room for a dozen, or so, and the entrance appeared empty. And then the hostess walked us through the hallway and down the stairs. Suddenly, we were in a positively charming lower dining room with a large dinner party and four other tables full of patrons wining and dining. Angels with Bagpipes is much larger inside than it initially appears, and the place is brimming with warm lighting, ambience and a decor that is equal parts relaxing and the perfect backdrop for intoxicated selfies.  Our waitress, Alice, was excellent. We had spent the day walking the city and doing all the usual touristy stuff, so by the time our 8:00 reservation came around, we were on the verge of slap-happy exhaustion. Fortunately for us, Alice rolled with our questions and our thorough reading of the menus - from drinks to meals, there is a lot to look over! (Especially when a Flying Scotsman cocktail is ready to knock you right out of the chair you're sitting in.)  And in reality, the entire staff was made up of professionals who take their job seriously, but still do it with a sense of humor. Food runners were attentive but personable, the aforementioned hostess was friendly and the entire visit here absolutely earned the highest marks for service.  And then there was the food. Was it the best meal we had in Edinburgh? You'd better believe it was. While two of us started with jaw-droppingly tasty cauliflower soup, I decided to stamp \"TOURIST\" on my forehead and order the haggis. In reality, I was blending in with the rest of the dining room's regulars and out-of-towners, because more than a few of us were chowing down on what ended up being a delicious concoction of... well, if you don't know what haggis is, you may not want to find out. Suffice it to say, it was wonderful!  Entrees were just as delectable. The salmon and lemon sole looked good and tasted even better. And my rabbit was one of the best dishes I have ever had. (It was one of those dishes where you begrudgingly share it with your dining partners so they can also experience what you are eating, but you're secretly hoping they don't take you up on your offer so there is more for you to enjoy.) Cap it off with a brownie that was divine and you have a dining experience unlike any other.  I really cannot recommend Angels with Bagpipes enough. Much like the titular creatures trading in their strings for something different, this restaurant stands out from the competition by offering a tough-to-beat combo of excellent service and an even better menu.",

The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, the service was very good, but unfortunately the food ran the gamut from excellent (the lamb & chicken entrees were delicious and spot on, as was the beef tartare), to good (smoked salmon and the goat cheese appetizers) to awful (the chateaubriand).  The latter was ordered on the advice of our waiter, so when it arrived (well presented as it was) came out raw rather than pink as we were told.  They removed the plates and returned with more properly cooked portions but the meat was tough and chewy. We could literally barely cut and chew the stuff!!!  I will say that the waiter did everything he could to help recover and offered a glass of complementary dessert wine to our 2 unhappy companions.  It was a very nice gesture and much appreciated!  The wine list had some good choices and overall I would recommend the restaurant- just stay away from the meat unless you are a risk taker!",

The a la carte menu offers quite a decent range of options, different meats, steaks and also, larger versions of some starters.  The set menu offered a decent range of choices too and so my friend went for mussels, slow cooked beef and rhubarb, custard, sorbet. All courses we enjoyed.   The other starters we tried were beef tartare-too vinegary but overall solid. The haggis was excellent. Different purees and sauces with haggis 2 ways offered a great starter.   My other friend and I shared chateaubriand for our main. This came with a choice of 3 sides, garlic butter and peppercorn sauce.   The beef was cooked well, the sauces were good and the sides were all delightfully and generously cooked with plenty of butter and cream. The right way. The mushrooms were particularly nice. My only complaint here is that I expected more beef for the money and the mash portion was rather stingy.  The apple dessert too was also good and every dish was presented with care.  Service was polite and friendly and we had a good time here.",

The only thing I didn't care for was the pigeon (which was prepared medium rare), but my husband loved it and he ate what I couldn't finish.   Service was excellent! Each wine, along with each course, were presented quite beautifully. I took a star out because of the pigeon, and also the location of our table. It was in front of the coat closet/storage room and the hostess and waitresses kept going in and out of that room. Kind of ruined a romantic dinner with my husband. Oh well, whatchagonnado......",

    "text": "It was one my friend's graduation day and we ended up coming here for dinner to celebrate. Make sure you have reservation for this place because you won't get a table otherwise your lucky. It's a small restaurant but centrally located on the Royal mile.   The place is pretty trendy and has the typical modern restaurant atmosphere. The menu has a good variety of first and second courses. We all opted out for the first course cause we didn't fancy anything on there but it had a couple of Scottish-esk selection like haggis and blood sausage.   For the main course, they offered venison, rabbit, fish, and steak. We all decided to get the 18oz chateaubriand. This dish is good for two people and they will ask you how you like your steak cooked... Rate, medium rare, etc. It also includes 3 different sides and 2 sauces. We asked our meat to be cooked rare and it definitely came out that way! The meat was not bloody and very tender. The meat was nice, but it was missing that meaty steak taste I like with this dish so I knew it wasn't age that long. You get plenty of meat, but the sides were pretty small servings as well as the sauces. The peppercorn and butter sauce however was amazing! For 55, it was decent and definitely satisfied my craving for steak.   The dessert selection was ok... Nothing really stood out for me. I was trying to be adventurous but also wanted something light since the meal was heavy so I ordered an apple dessert. This was a disappointing dessert and I wouldn't recommend getting it cause it basically was just cut up Granny Smith apples with caramel and a couple of crunchy sponge. I expected a lot more from this dish and we all joked around how this was more of a salad than a dessert. Highly disappointed since I'm a total dessert person and they could have easily created a better homage for the apple. My suggestion... Avoid this dessert cause the chocolate brownie and the cheesecake looked and tasted better.   The staff were all nice especially the front desk staff who helped us the whole night. They watched over us and made sure we were happy with things.   I'd come back to this place and taste the other dishes since the food was well cooked and flavourful. I like the trendy atmosphere and the location as well. The price of the dishes follows the norm of these type of restaurant, so that was good. Overall, it was a good experience that definitely help making my friend's graduation day, a little bit more special!",

I know that is long for dinner, but the table behind us had been empty the whole time, and the service at the beginning of dinner was lackluster (we had a different waiter at first).  Otherwise this place was top notch.  We ate here for our last dinner in Scotland and it did not disappoint.  My friend and I both had the lamb rump, and my mother had the salmon.  We all cleaned our plates.  But the best part, for me, was the dessert.  The two desserts we had were the most beautifully deconstructed dishes I've ever seen.  I had the rhubarb crisp and my friend had something with chocolate , coconut and lime.  Both were so amazing, I wanted to lick the plates!  This was when the hostess came up and knocked a star off by asking us to vacate our table ASAP.  A little annoying when you're spending so much money, but not enough to ruin the overall experience.  I would definitely return here for the AMAZING food.",

    "text": "Came here on the recommendation of a friend. I had some misgivings, considering it's on the Royal Mile, ensconced among the tourist shops and attractions. But since it came recommended, I decided to give it a shot.   Pro tip: don't go alone. Being a solo diner is tantamount to being a leper in full bloom. When I asked for a table for one, the hostesses looked at me like I had a third eye. They tried to hide their horror but subtlety isn't their strong suit.   Despite visibly available tables both outside and in the main dining room, the hostess informed me the *only* thing they had was \"downstairs.\"  I guess being a solo diner, I shouldn't expect anything better.  At least they didn't make me sit in the alley by the garbage.   The hostess is working overtime to explain why \"downstairs\" is SO much better than where they let the rest of the normal people sit and where they keep the natural light and cool air. Save it, sister. Message received.   I sit at a table made for two that is situated halfway into a hallway (I sit in the chair not in the hallway). My hostess gushes about how so-n-so, my waiter, will be taking SUCH good care of me since I am lucky enough to be in the basement, I mean \"downstairs.\" On the upside, the bathroom is ten steps from my table, just in case!  I sit with menus and tap water for a slightly longer time than would be customary. Maybe they're hoping someone is going to join me and save me from my solitude (but, really, who wants to sit in the hallway?).  So-n-so the waiter, who looks distractingly like a young, chubby, bespectacled, stubbly Russell Crowe, comes over, dispensing with formalities and asking me if I'm ready to order. I think they're trying to fast track me out of here at this point in case the hallway seat is in high demand.   I inform Russell that I would like to order a glass of wine first, if that's okay.  I order a glass of some very nondescript pinot blanc and gnaw on my rock-hard sourdough bread, dipping it in my olive oil and balsamic (sigh - when did this become the fall-back bread course?). But there's a twist! Normally the oil and vinegar is served on a plate to allow you to absorb oil AND vinegar. Here, it's served in a tiny bowl.   Physics lesson: the vinegar sinks to the bottom, which means if you want to get some of the balsamic on your bread, you've either got to go diving for it (and drown your bread in oil in the process) or you have to create a little whirlpool in the bowl, which I think is frowned upon in polite society.   Russell comes back to ask me again if I'm ready to order (that hallway seat is waiting!). I decide to give Russ the benefit of the doubt and ask him to recommend one of two appetizers I'm considering. Before I can get the two of choices out of my mouth, he blurts out \"sea bass!\" like a fisherman with Tourette's.   Since it was one of the ones I was considering, and it's paired with my glass of whatever-that-wine is, I take his recommendation. Mistake. This looks gross.   Piece of sea bass with skin on (pet peeve) and an ink cracker (presumably squid ink and ... styrofoam?) that looks like bubble wrap covered in tar. All floating on a bed of curry.   Once the fish skin is removed (ew ew ew), it's fine. I guess it's a good thing I didn't order the haggis appetizer (there was never a risk of that happening, btw).  The curry has nice flavor and mild heat, but it's consistency is a little thick - almost gelatinous. This cracker though...    I'm not sure why the seabass was paired with the boring wine, though. Maybe they're trying to move that out of the wine cellar in favor of something new...  All in all, I'd give this appetizer 2.75 stars out of 5.   While I wait for my main course, I notice that the soundtrack is unusual. Not Scottish. Not Italian (is this an Italian restaurant?). It's 70s R&B. Stevie Wonder's \"Sir Duke.\"  Before that, that Tina Turner/Phil Spector tune. Okay.   Looking forward to my entree. 8 Oz filet with peppercorn sauce and a side of mushrooms and garlic. I wonder when it's going to get here...  I'll be there - Jackson 5 Let's get it on - Marvin Gaye?  Meat - not a great sear. Sea salt on top but still lacked flavor. Underdone. A little sinewy in places.   Mushrooms - great but where's the garlic?  Peppercorn sauce - sweetness yuck it's supposed to be peppery not sweet.   Fries? Who cares?  I'm nearly through my meal. Russell hasn't come by to check on me once. Maybe he sees I'm making notes and is freaked out?   Russell is being very attentive and jocular w the table of five next to me. I feel slighted.   I order a forgettable dessert and made my way out. No thank you, no nothing.   Customer service: 0/5 Atmosphere: not applicable (but it looked nice where they let the humans sit) Wine: 1/5 Food:  2.5/5 Value: 1/5 (way overpriced for the quality)",

If I could award half stars I would really leave 4.5, as half a star would be deducted for the service.  I found our server relatively unhelpful/impatient/terse.  I would say she was fairly unfriendly compared to the other staff at this restaurant and I was pretty turned off after just ordering our drinks. Luckily the food made up for any negative impressions that I had.  We decided to take our chances with the chateaubriand (even though our server described it plainly as just a \"large filet\" when we asked how it was prepared).  We had it cooked medium rare which is really the only way you should cook a good cut of meat. Overall verdict: phenomenal. The meat is very very lean. You are offered two types of sauces: a butter sauce and peppercorn- I would highly recommend the butter sauce because butter makes everything better.  We did start with the haggis which was delicious- but I personally think haggis is tasty regardless of where you get it.  No dessert for us after 16+ ounces of meat.  Would I come back or recommend this place to others? Sure! It's definitely a nicer environment compared to the other pubs in the area and the meals are moderately priced.  The experience isn't like the Witchery so you can't come in here expecting that, but you would certainly have a nice evening here.",

    "text": "Absolutely loved my experience at Angels with Bagpipes. I'd heard about this place from a lot of family that had visited Edinburgh and so I went for a late lunch on a Tuesday.   We were able to order from the seasonal menu. Between my table we tried the Smoked Salmon dip starter, which was slightly cirtusy but the overall texture and consistency was great. For the main course I had the pasta dish with orecchiette, courgette, chilli, Parmesan, pine nuts. The pasta was quite cheesy but the chilli and courgette added nicely to the flavour. For dessert I had the apple puff pastry with vanilla ice cream, which also had a circle of cream around it. Quite difficult to eat cleanly, but it tasted amazing.  The staff were so sweet, never rushing us and always willing to answer questions. We were surprised at how easily we were able to be seated and, despite a staff change in the middle of our meal, the whole thing went smoothly.  The restaurant was also lovely and warm (a save in grace considering the almost freezing temperature outside).   Overall a super pleasant experience and would definitely recommend to anyone visiting and looking for a slightly more expensive meal than your average pub.",

I figured it was my 1st time in Scotland, try local fare.   My husband and I decided to get the 2 person entree of the  Chateaubriand steak, 18 oz, and comes with 3 sides to share.  We ordered it to be prepared medium and they did not disappoint. The meat was tender and the right shade of pink. Our 3 sides to share: chips- perfectly crisp, green beans- flavorful and the right texture and wild mushrooms- delicious if you love mushrooms.   Our meal also comes with bread which was fresh.  It was my husbands birthday so it was nice to receive a complimentary glass of champagne.   We were stuffed but forced ourselves to have dessert since it was my husband's birthday. We went with the chocolate brownie. We wanted something small to share.   We would definitely come back again when we visit Scotland. Service, quality and location make this place worth coming back to!",

My husband got the Hagis starter and I started w the Salmon. Both were just amazing. Oh and there was an amazing looking pumpkin soup on the tasting menu so the waiter made an exception and was able to bring me a bowl. It.was.amazjng. It had little pieces of prosciutto in it.  For main course my husband had the lamb and I had the rabbit. Also a good wine list and fun cocktails!   The full experience was great! I highly recommend!",

On my second visit, I had the scallops with black pudding as my starter.  They were delicately seared and placed on bed of black pudding.  Unlike most black pudding which is heavy and greasy, here it was light fluffy and complements the scallops well.    For the main, I had pollock.  The fish was extremely fresh and has a clean taste to it.  Again every so recommended for people trying Scottish produce cooked to perfection.",
