    "text": "You don't come to Pizza Hut for fine dining so I don't feel the need to post an essay length review of what it's like when you come here.  The pizza is the same in all the branches, so is the fact you get free refills on juice so long as you're eating and haven't paid your bill.  This particular branch can be hit and miss with the service. On my most recent visit here, one of the members of staff whose name I never managed to see, seemed to throw anything at me and my fiancee any time we asked for anything, not the best service in the world.  Good for a cheap night out if you fancy some pizza though.",

    "text": "Great pizza restaurant in the cinema complex in Fountainpark. It is quite spacious and offers a very warm interior. Staff are friendly but sometimes could be a bit slow. There is a good choice of pizza toppings and drinks. Menu is similar to all other branches of the chain. You could also order the famous hot cookie with ice-cream topping, some say they are ready to kill for it. Really pleasant for relaxation, catch up with friends or any kind of family gatherings.",

    "text": "Probably the best Pizza Hut in the city. This place has a very laid-back atmosphere and is perfect for a pre- or post- cinema meal. The staff are friendly, if sometimes a little confused, and the food arrives promptly to your table.   I've been really pleased every time I've eaten here, even though I've asked for some slightly strange things on occasion (please leave off the raspberry sauce on the cheesecake being one of them). I've always left a generous tip because the service has deserved it. Only once did anyone get mixed up with my order, but once I managed to get them to see what had happened it was fixed right away.",
