    "text": "You know the Seinfeld episode 'The Cafe', where Jerry persuades a local restaurant to stop serving a random multicultural menu and instead focus on one cuisine, which ends up being a disaster and then at the end when the foursome all fancy different meals they wish it still existed? Ladies and gents, I introduce you to Comet Food Bites.  Comet is tucked away on a wee side street in Leith, and I can't imagine it'll get much passing trade, but helpfully it is on Hungry House and has its own website ordering system, so hopefully it'll get a lot of online customers like me (not that I actually live that far from it, I'm just lazy).  The menu is long and varied, including pastas, risotto, enchiladas, burritos, burgers, pizza, chicken wings... you get the idea.  Being really quite hungover, I plumped for a burger meal deal (with chips and a drink) for the ridiculously cheap price of 3.99. In order to bump it up to the minimum delivery charge of a tenner, I added a 10\" pizza and a portion of profiteroles too.  Now, by no means is this the best burger in Edinburgh, but for the price it's really very decent. The chips were ok too, which helps. And whilst I didn't eat the pizza the same night (I'm not *that* greedy), it stood up well to being reheated for lunch the next day. So well, in fact, that we ordered pizzas again the very next evening (2 12\" for 12, nae bad at all).  A word on the pizzas. These aren't your standard toppings - you'll find no pepperoni here. In fact it seems like the pizza toppings are derived from elsewhere in the menu, hence the abundance of bacon. I had the Lumberjack pizza (bacon, onions and mushroom), and then we had the Meat Tower (ham, bacon, sausage, white beef ragu) and the Carbonara (garlic cream sauce, bacon, egg). The Lumberjack was good, as was the Meat Tower, but I was less taken by the Carbonara. The garlic cream sauce was too much, way too overpowering and I couldn't finish it as a result. But it was cheap!  The profiteroles were a bit meh too, with a curiously thin and runny chocolate sauce.  On the whole however, Comet is a solid four stars. It's nice to have more takeaway options in the area, and at this price you can't complain about the quality (unless it was really bad, which is certainly isn't). I can definitely see us ordering from here again.",

    "text": "Comet Foodbites has solid claims on being the cheapest very good burger in the city, as a burger and fries (with drink of your choice) comes in at a very reasonable 3.49. The rest of their menu, including wraps, pizza, etc, is similarly priced. This has been a very tricky location in the past, with Bakehoven and the White Bird Bakery not sustaining, but this place has every chance to do well.  Overall, we said: \"I'm hopeful that Comet Foodbites can build an audience for their high value comestibles. I'll definitely be back to give their other menu items a try as I found the burgers extremely pleasing. Add it to your list for a visit, soon.\"",

    "text": "the worst burger I have ever seen, goes to show you really do get what you pay for as this looked more like dog food rather than a burger, the 'fries' were soggy and disgusting and the chicken enchiladas were dripping with grease, definitely wouldn't recommend to anyone let alone feed it to a dog",
