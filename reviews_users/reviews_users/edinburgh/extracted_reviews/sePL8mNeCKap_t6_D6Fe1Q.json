    "text": "With such high marks, we visited for lunch on our first day in Edinburgh. We both ordered the falafel wrap, which did have a very affordable lunch combo option that my husband took advantage of.   Although I had reviews that seemed to indicate there was a toppings bar, the layout didn't make it seem like customers could lean over and start fiddling with items nor was it offered. We both tried the original falafel and found it to be serviceable. It was good, not great or WOW. It did the trick for two hungry travelers at a reasonable price (the chips were okay too). I think that I had high expectations based on what others had shared, so I would caution future visitors to temper their expectations. I hope though that their experience exceeds our own!",

    "text": "If ever I am in doubt over what to cook for my dinner, I ALWAYS go Elfalafel.  Living just around the corner from the shop, I am in it an embarrassing amount but it is so worth it as the food is amazing.   The food is mostly ethnic inspired as they serve chicken shawarma's, kebabs and have a great selection of different falafel flavours, including spinach and chili, but there is also more traditional food like burgers and fish and chips. There is an open salad bar so you are able to choose which sauces and salad bits you want on your wrap or kebab.   Elfalafel is situated in the ideal spot - just across the road from George Square, the University students playground.  The food is inexpensive - it is 4 for a burger, chips and drink, and a student discount is available. The staff are incredibly friendly and chatty and there is a decent sized seating area in Elfalafel so you are able to eat your meal inside.  I cannot recommend this place any higher - GO!!!",

    "text": "Elfalafel offers what you might expect. Falafel. Amongst other things.  Elfalafel is actually technically  a falafel and \"mixed grill\" eatery. They offer a variety plays falafel, wraps and kebabs. It also offers an \"open salad bar\" where you can pick and choose what salads and filling you want with your pitta bread of wrap. This provides well for vegetarians!  Situated near George Sq. expect a lot of students, especially late at night on the weekend! This central location certainly gives Elfalafel an advantage, and if you're in the area and don't know where else to eat, or just fancy a light bite, it might just be worth checking out.  There is room for about twenty seated, and there's usually plenty of space. Most choose to take away.  It does feel a little bit like Elfalafel sees itself as a high class falafel specialist, and I'll admit their fresh food is of a great standard, but at the time the place still feels like another takeaway. Perhaps there is an identity crisis. Perhaps this will change.",

    "text": "The clue is in the title, its main dish is falafel and it does it very well!  You can also get pizza but I wouldn't bother they don't look or taste nearly as good as the falafel.  They have a massive selection of salad to go with the falafel and my friend is always pleased at how much houmous they let you have (he's easily pleased!)   The interior is geared towards takeaway with a big counter from which to order but there are seats too.  The staff are really friendly and as with a lot of takeaways have to deal with fairly inebriated and slightly confused or rowdy customers but they are always patient, friendly and polite.",

    "text": "Despite being allergic to falafel, an immediate disadvantage, El Falafel is still pretty good for your takeaway needs. It has a few different kebabs on offer as well as some tasty pizzas. The only problem for me though is that their speciality is falafel, which causes some problems.  It is a standard takeaway and well located, next to Bristo Square so if your about that way it does the job. The problem is that I'm allergic to its main dish, so it's not really for me.",
