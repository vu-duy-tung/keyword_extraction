Lots of wood and cool lampshades makes it feel very modern-continental. It's comfortable and relaxing and big windows gives a real sense of fresh air.  There's daily specials which are normally quite unusual but light, fresh and most importantly tasty. Reasonably priced as you can pick up a panini or sarnie for under a 5 which is rare for any city centre sit-down.  Staff seem happy and enthusiastic and make real recommendations rather than just making stuff up in their heads (you can tell when people do that)",

I had a roll with black pudding and egg that was totally spot on and everyone else really enjoyed their breakfast grills- the veggie and normal alike. It had a lovely atmosphere, and although we were all in getting breakfast there was an elegant table near us that we're having fizz. It had a nice buzz and eclectic mix (although potentially this was heightened by the festival atmosphere that pervades the city?)",

When I looked at the menu before going, I thought things seemed a tad on the expensive side for lunch. When I arrived, I was won over by the great ambiance of the place - it feels like a rustic French kitchen with bare wood floors, a large and open room, and tap water served in big old jugs. I just went for the soup of the day, which was a delicious sweet potato, pear, and chilli soup served with homemade wheat bread. It was all delicious, even if a tad spicy with all those chillies! For what it was, it seemed a bit of a small serving for soup for 4.50 but it was excellent. Everything else was a bit expensive for just a lunch I thought, but I did like the feel of the place except that the service wasn't anything to write home about since the staff weren't particularly friendly or attentive. Also, my other small gripe was that it seemed a bit noisy. This place seemed to attract lots of noisy kids today (I guess it is half-term, though). Perhaps it is better on a normal basis. I would think that Spoon Cafe has a very different ambiance at night compared to during the day. I enjoyed the sunny windows and think I would definitely come back for coffee, or perhaps for lunch.",

Funky decor - vintage wallpaper and second-hand furniture, old crockery (we had fizz served in beautiful old champagne glasses). Welcoming of kids (and has a corner with things for them to play with) but without being 'kiddie place'. Been there for coffee and cake, lunch with four under 5's and late-on dinner at night and keep going back.   Always been an interesting mix of people in there, from dinner-out people to people on their own reading books to what looked like study groups with laptops. Enjoyed all the food but must-have was the cake/pudding. The best creme brulee my husband's ever had in a restaurant, apparently!   Must-see is the magazine cut-outs on the back of the ladies' toilet doors - patterns for knitting your own twin-set and agony aunt columns from the 60s.

Situated in the centre of the busy and bustling Nicolson Street, Spoon Cafe Bistro is just across the road from the main University campus George Square and is a short walk from the city centre and so it is a convenient place to reach.   It looks pretty small and poky from the outside, but it is really spacious and open inside with wooden floors and lots of spaces between the tables which doesn't make it feel cramped and crowded. They have a selection of home made cakes, pastries and antipasti style dishes available. Spoon Cafe Bistro also offers soups, salads and cooked meals such as sausages for lunch, which cost about six pounds each. I come here quite a lot between my classes for a snack and a coffee, and I always have one of their home made cakes which are really beautiful, especially the chocolate brownie which is really light and fluffy which chunks of chocolate in it - yum!   Spoon Cafe Bistro also offers a very sophisticated dinner menu, if a bit short, which includes braised pork, squid and aubergine stew. I think sometimes they are trying to make themselves look more posh than they really are, but the food they produce is really gorgeous.",

    "text": "I'd heard several people rave on about Spoon and decided to finally visit when with my mother after she helped me move into a new flat nearby. I was initially impressed with Spoon. It was a large spacious cafe bistro, with interesting pictures with chairs imprinted with maps and pages from comics. It had a sort of a tidy \"bits and bobs\" feel. I was also impressed by the friendly waitress. It was a big improvement from the Chinese buffet house that used be here.  From then on it went downhill. The menu was small, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but there was little for vegetarians. I wanted to have soup with something else but my only options were basically soup with mushrooms or some mushroom quiche. In the end I just went with the soup. Hoping it would be enough to at least temporarily fill me up, I was given one of the measliest bowls of soup ever with a  little slice of bread. It tasted okay, all two sips of it. Maybe this place is named after its maximum portion size. A spoonful. I had heard this place was inexpensive (one of the reasons I was excited) for what you got but it wasn't, and my wallet was all the lighter for it.  What I thought was a simple, cheap place to grab some filling lunch was a disappointing experience. I left almost as hungry as when I went in.   The only other problem about this place is you are only allowed to eat with spoons. Nothing else. Even the steak. Spoons only. Okay that's a lie. But I do feel like I might as well have pocketed some of the cutlery with me to make up my money's worth.  I have since heard from others that this place has gone down hill a bit, that it used to be cheaper and the portions bigger. Maybe the recession hit it hard. Maybe it will improve again. Maybe I will try again one day and just ask for coffee.",

I like having my face burned by hot oil more than going to a nightclub.  I'm 30. I am a grandma. I like grandma things, like tea in bed while watching my 'programs'. I like simple egg sandwiches and scones. I like weird fresh lime sodas that the kids don't think are delicious.  I like keeping a spare band-aid handy, just in case. I like flowery patterns and sun filled rooms with big tables and fresh flowers.  So, decidedly, I lu-uh-uhve this place.   Now, admittedly I didn't eat much, just a lovely egg sandwich cooked to perfection with hot sauce on some fresh baked bread. I had a sip of the ice coffee, and a bit of a latte, and a fresh lime soda! All very posh feeling, all a little bit pricey.   Screw expensive, I'm willing to throw down an extra .50p for a giant sun-filled room where I actually get a table and they don't bribe me to take away my coffee just so there's extra room in the cafe (I'm talking to you Black Medicine, you who I so dearly love).   There's huge tables! Couches! Books! Board games! And it's quiet enough to read, enjoy a coffee and sit for as long as you like without feeling like an asshole who's taking up a table.   The service was pretty excellent too, although I like my servers to be slightly less attractive so I feel like I can bring a date there. This place is definitely a friend-only, study alone place.   It's an amazing, wonderful, delicious, beautiful, perfect grandma friendly - BUT NOT grandma exclusive - place.",

I am usually a big fan of strange. The interior is confused, mixing vintage with urban decor in a spacious informal environment. There are couches and board games trying to marry a modern dining experience.   The service is slow and the menu is 'seasonal' which is often code for 'limited'. In this case it is, with lunch being difficult for those who aren't fans of fish or pork. Though hear the vegetarian options are nice, they are expensive. In fact, you won't leave this place without shelling out a good  15 easy (with a drink), for a mediocre lunch and a chance to sit at a 'cool' wooden table. Plus the portions are pretty small and not hugely filling. I don't mind spending a bit extra for locally inspired, creative food, but it should make an impact and I don't find that to be the case here.  Meh, not my thing.",

My Dad took me here a couple of months ago before we went to see Scottish Ballet at the theatre, so perfect for the pre-theatre menu. The restaurant has an almost laid back, student feel to it while still trying to be quirky and sophisticated with it's mismatched chairs, bookcases and lamps.   My Dad and the rest of our party all had the pate and sour dough bread for starters, which came in a cute little pot. I sampled some and was instantly jealous, giving me high hopes for the main. Firstly, the pre-theatre menu had very little choice so I felt I kind of \"lumped\" for my main of ham, egg and chips. Of course it was done in a very chic way with approximately 4 hand cut chips positioned perfectly on the plate. It was nice, but it was so damn salty that I couldn't finish it. I didn't add salt to the dish but the chef clearly added it by the bucket load.  I was the only one to have dessert, a clementine jelly. It was refreshing and sweet, quite delicious really.   This restaurant has the potential to be so much better. I'm stuck between three and four stars, so I am going to be generous and give them four due to it's reasonably priced pre-theatre menu and location.",

The space is well lit, particularly by the setting sun at this time of year, and furnished in an understated yet quirky fashion.   The service is prompt and pleasant and the range of wines well priced, ranging from 10.95 to around the 25 mark. Unusually for a modest establishment of this sort they stock a dessert wine but that's to be commended.   Opting for the pre-theatre menu (9.95 for two courses, 12.95 for three) my starter of potted duck was an ample size although more than one pickle would have been an improvement. My companion's soup of the day was pronounced a success although I've forgotten the flavour. Our main courses of skirt steak with champ & braised onions and baked feta with beetroot, blood orange and chick peas were both great (NB - this was a starter deliberately ordered as the second course) and the cheese board (brie, manchego and a soft blue) is the first I've had in a long time where the proportion of biscuits to cheese was spot on (if only Qype would award half stars that alone would have been enough for one).   I can readily see myself revisiting here soon.",

The menu doesn't just have the usual soups and sandwiches, but also some more interesting dishes like smoked chicken salad.  I went for the wild boar sausages which were served with stewed peppers.  Our meals seemed to take no time to arrive and tasted amazing when they did, costing only about 6 each.   I definitely recommend Spoon Cafe for great food and service at reasonable prices.",

    "text": "The original Spoon used to be a gorgeous little cafe, perfect for meting friends or wasting a sunday afternoon eating cake.  Then they moved to Nicolson Street and tried to turn themselves into a bigger, bistro-style place, and I don't think they've really pulled it off. Being opposite the Festival Theatre means they do have a good pre-theatre menu in the evenings offerings a choice of three different starters/mains/desserts, which is really good value at 12.95 for 3 courses or 9.95 if you can only fit in 2.  But what they've lost in the new Spoon is the cosy, inviting atmosphere that there was in the old place. Where they've tried to be stylish and minimalist, they've ended up being clinical and cold.  It all depends what you want, personally when I go out to eat the thing I care most about is the food and not the decor. But if you're sitting with someone who clearly has their priorities the other way round, and so will not stop whingeing about it, it does end up ruining your meal.",

You can easily stand beside the counter for a couple of minutes waiting for a table, and then have someone pop over to you asking if they can help you with anything (in a slightly puzzled look). Well, since there's a sign asking me to wait to be seated, yes you can!  But the thing that really bothered me the last few times I was here was the lack of hygiene, spotty subject, I know. But when I find dust in my teacup, we've got an issue, and I don't just mean a cleaning issue. We've got a caring issue. I love this place, but in order for it to be great, the staff must love it as well and take care of it as if it's their own.  Now, this might just have been the winter blues for the past 2 months but come on people, step up your game! I'm rooting for you here!",

    "text": "Stopped in for a coffee with a friend earlier today, and I must say that I did not expect what I saw at Spoon.  I have read many a review of the place and of course walked by it several times.  From the outside, it seems so unattainable.  It is a cafe situated on top of a cafe.  It almost seemed intimidating, like it was saying: \"Yeah, we're a cafe... but are you located 5 meters above ground level?  That's what I thought. Peasant!\"  The pleasant looking plants in the windows didn't help the \"not a college student atmosphere\" vibe it was putting out.  I was shocked, however, upon entering to find a spacious cafe catering to a wide demographic (by \"wide demographic\" I don't mean \"fat people\"... sorry fat people).  When you enter, you walk up a set wide stairs (sorry fat stairs) which ends with a series of old glass windows which time has rendered wavy and hard to see through.  From there you enter a vast expanse of... erm... well cafe.  It's a seat yourself kind of deal, with tables in a variety of sizes and shapes and newspaper coveredness.  It has kind of a quirkiness to it that makes you feel right at home instantly.  (Oh, it doesn't.... that's just me?  *Sobs quietly to self*)  Now, people have been raving about the prices, and I won't disagree... mostly because I can't.  I only had a coffee, which ran me about 1.95.  I've had much cheaper coffee, but then again I've also had much crappier coffee.  So it's not the cheapest cup o' joe in the city, sue me (don't), but the atmosphere and quality make up for the inflated price tag, I feel.",

    "text": "Spoon is one of those places that I tend to forget about when I'm in this part of Edinburgh (which is quite often); perhaps because its first-floor location is accessed via a very unassuming staircase off Nicholson Street that is easy to walk past.  However, it really is deserving of more attention as the food is really rather good and definitely sets this place way above other eateries in the vicinity (did you see what I did there?).  The decor seems like it's trying to create a vibe that's somewhere between a 60's kitchen and living room, being an eclectic mix of 60's furniture, mis-matched tables and chairs, standard lamps and those wire coatstands with plastic ends. It's errr... shall we say funky?  Spoon's pre-theatre menu is excellent value for money, with 3 courses setting you back a mere 16. Choices are well thought out, and there is always a veggie and a gluten-free option available. We both had the sea bream on Asian coleslaw with peanuts, chilli and coriander and the fish was just perfectly grilled. I preceded this with a starter of root vegetable and brown lentil soup that I could almost have stood the spoon up in, and topped it off with a dark chocolate pot with pear and shortbread.   Herself, who was nursing an incipient cold, was very impressed with a hot 'winter warmer' cocktail that involved mulched ginger, chillies, cloves and rum. This lifted her spirits so much that she was forced to order a second, whilst I made do with a glass or two of Pino Grigio.  The service was a little relaxed as we waited almost an hour for the main course to arrive, but to be fair they were very busy with the pre-theatre crowd and it was certainly worth the wait for the sea bream. Lovely.",

They've gone for a kinda found art kinda vibe. Somewhere between kitschy and rustic. Not something I have a problem with per say, but it's kinda cold. Both in temperature and feel. Their multitude of low wattage energy saver bulbs makes for awful light quality, and it's quite harsh to have staring at you. Not only that but a lot of the staff seem quite cold to me too. We had one nice waitress, but the guy I recognised from before and the hipster bar dude we're both aloof at best.   Then we have the food. Quite simply, I'm better than whoever they have. If I'm going out for a meal, I want food that impresses me, that ignites my senses. I'm just so utterly underwhelmed by the place every time I'm here. It all sounds nice on the menu, but they just don't seem able to walk the walk.",

Spoon have two areas, one for drinking and casual talk, another one for food. i tried the food once, which is nice but still not good price for a student lunch. but i go to Spoon to meet friends and have drinks often, and sometimes order a piece of cake. the cakes of Spoon must be mentioned because they have different selections each time you went to. so that means their cakes are fresh made everyday.  The drinks are lovely, especially the hot chocolate,which is made from the real dark chocolate. You can tell it from the taste.  i love the inside decoration of spoon so much. i love every detailed stuff of it. :) definitely a good choice for meeting friends or just stay there alone yourself.",

    "text": "I like Spoon, I do, but I should point out that my 4 star rating is based on the culmination of my visits thus far. If it were to be based on my most recent visit it'd be a 3.  Spoon has a lovely vintage atmosphere and decor (though it used to be much more eclectic, with vintage print and ads plastered on the columns), and it's a really big space. I'd hedge a bet and say it's too big for the kitchen, as food tends to take quite a while to arrive, even when it's not busy (but of course it can be nowhere near full yet still be seating a fair number of people!).  Mostly recently I attended for Yelp's Brunchy Munchy, but alas as we'd visited on a Saturday we had to make do with the breakfast menu rather than the brunch menu (only available on a Sunday, boo). I ordered the porridge, which was nice enough, though I was glad to still have some milk left in my jug from my pot of tea as otherwise it would have been a bit much and a bit solid. It was a fairly reasonable 3.50 for a bowl of porridge with a dollop of jam in the middle (I'd have liked a bit more jam, mind), but I'd waited an hour for it to arrive (yes, an hour for porridge), so I was pretty famished by the time it arrived and it felt wholly inappropriate as it was now decidedly lunch time rather than breakfast.  In the past though, I've tried a variety of dishes from lunch and dinner. Nothing is complicated, it's all competent to slightly fancy home cooking in style, but it's all delicious and flavourful. The set menu is a good deal, though limited in option, and there's always a variety of specials on offer (watch out for who writes this up though, I once had to go right up to the board to read it - the waiter who had written it admitted his handwriting is illegible - not helpful!).  Spoon is handily located for the Festival Theatre, and as it opened when I was studying over the road at Old College, I used to pop by for soup and a sandwich occasionally to break up library sessions. It's also easily one of the best options in the area for food.  Spoon misses out on that elusive 5th star I'm afraid, but on the whole it's very good.",

I admit I was a bit underwhelmed when I saw the menu (and the lack of meat options) but the food was so delicious I'll happily eat my words. The savoy and red cabbage the gratin was served on was crunchy and buttery and although the gratin looked small it was really satisfying and the rustic menu felt wholesome in a non-holy way. The decor is fun, higgledy piggledy charity shop chic - if you're lucky enough to find a charity shop full of Ercol :)",

It is a place for everything: breakfast, lunch and dinner with a changing menu. So far I have enjoyed their Scottish Breakfast several time (Haggis + English Breakfast. Delicious!) but their lunch menu us very good too.  It's a nice and cozy place to come, eat and read if you like.  It is central yet not too busy because it is situated in first floor and not too easily accessible, but that is something I like about them, because it gives it a sort of piece. It gets a bit crowded on Saturday mornings, though.",

It's a great place to meet friends for a drink and there's even a large table which I've seen used by what looked like a book club.  The food is generally good although not always consistent.  Great place to grab a bite before a show at Festival Theatre, just let them know if you have time constraints.   Full review with photos please visit my blog which can be found on my profile.",

It was alright, nothing spectacularly amazing though.   But the atmosphere! Spoon is in such a lovely location and the cafe is so well-lit with windows on all the walls. The quirky decorations and furniture just scream whimsical. It kind of makes you want to instagram everything in the room.  Basicallly, the food is okay but the atmosphere bumps it up to four stars.",

    "text": "This is what I want my house to look like.  Y'know, when I grow up. I love the mismatched furniture, the map covered tables, the random curtain (what does that do?) and the odd bits of furniture that make this open space look a lot less like a canteen than it otherwise might.  Spoon Cafe Bistro is pretty nice place to grab some food, with a decent lunch time menu and some interesting specials. A main for lunch will set you back 8-11 but it's more than soup and a sandwich so I'm happy. There's also a good, reasonably priced tea selection, their lapsang souchong is well worth it at only 2.   On my recent visit I had mussels with chips and mayo. As a Dubliner and, more importantly, a Clontarfian I likes me some mussels! These were cooked in parsley, butter and onions which was really perfect. The chips were handcut and resembled wedges but not soggy, as I've seen so many times before!  I didn't go for a dessert myself but did gaze longingly at my friends pear and polenta cake with marscapone.   I'm lamenting the lack of half stars as 3.5 would more accurately describe my feelings about the place. The service was easy, breezy beautiful but pretty slow, like, glacial. We were there for 2 hours and literally just nearly managed to fit in the dessert. We had to bring up the cash on the way out just to hurry ourselves along.   Other than that everything was perfect!",

    "text": "OK, this review has a slightly positive bias because I am a HUGE Harry Potter nerd and Spoon Cafe Bistro is located in the former Nicolson's Cafe, where JK Rowling first started penning her masterpiece.  So if, like me, you are a fan of the HP series and are also having a touristy day/weekend in Edinburgh, this is an excellent choice for lunch as it has a direct link to that beloved series and is also handily just a 1/2 mile from Edinburgh Castle.    Now, if this had just been a regular place without the patina of JK Rowling's presence giving it that extra magical glow (pun most definitely intended), I would probably have only rated it 3 stars, because the cost to food ratio just doesn't add up.  The individual options are pretty inexpensive but there is not much on the plate, and so you have to order a few things to feel satisfied.  This means lunch will probably cost you about 10 to 15 if you want to achieve proper fullness.  And you do, if you've been tromping about the castle and are preparing for some more tromping down the Royal Mile and up to Arthur's Seat.    However, it is an amiable little spot, with big bright windows, subtly kooky furnishings, plenty of seating, lovely service and very tasty food.  While all those things do much to recommend the place, if you are not a mega-HP fan like myself you might leave a little miffed (and hungry) about the small portion sizes.",

The style of the cafe is so very divine - there's a vintage chic feel about it. It feels like the sort of place I could easily spend hours studying over a green tea and then forget about my lecture because I became so enamoured with the place.   It has a very relaxed feel and I like the fact that everyone seemed busy, preoccupied - reading books, working away. I had the thai fish and coconut soup as it's something I normally wouldn't consider. It was absolutely delicious! The elderflower juice was also great!   The clincher for me has to be dessert. What a delicious carrot cake! My favourite cake of all the cakes and it most certainly didn't disappoint! Service wasn't the quickest and one star has to be knocked off for the price. It was a little expensive for an everyday lunch. But I'd say Spoon is more of a treat. It certainly is special!",

The place itself had a nice cozy living room type feel and the server and guy behind the bar were super friendly and just generally enthused about the food/drinks they were serving.  I got a meat-type soup and a fish dish.  Both were really excellent.  Kind of blanking on exactly what they consisted of, but everything was fresh, tasty and just generally a great meal.   Also: It's got a bit of a romance vibe.  But, like, hipster romance.  So bike rides and craft beers, that kind of thing.",

We tried the breakfast late on a Friday morning. The place definitely gets busier toward lunchtime and started filling up towards the end of our meal around noon. I love all of the plants and the cosiness of the floor plan.   Food wise, I tried the porridge and an egg roll which were both pretty good. The roll was huge and pretty cheap for its size.   The service was somewhat lacking though, despite the fact that we were one of the only people in the restaurant when we first arrived. I had ordered a cappuccino and my friend ordered an Americano and they came out with two cappuccinos. We told them it was wrong, they quickly replaced it and we joked about them bringing out two porridges, which they then proceeded to do! After messing up the order twice, they then charged us for multiple cappuccinos and Americanos.",

The menu is not huge but at least you know that they will concentrate on these few good dishes.  The price is certainly on the cheaper side and most of them cost less than 10.

The space is beautiful with a light airy feel, quirky decor, mismatched furniture which gives it a lovely comfortable living room feel whilst also remaining chic and smart. It is all open plan but they've cleverly sectioned it off with light curtain dividers. It's an idea space for large groups as well as being still quite cosy for smaller groups too.  I've been a few times and again just recently where a friend and I shared a veggie grill breakfast and a lovely bowl of homemade soup. Everything on the grill was delicious - best veggie haggis I've ever tasted! I really couldn't fault it.  Staff are friendly, warm and helpful. You also don't feel rushed at all and can leisurely soak in the soothing atmosphere.   Prices I feel are about average for the quality and overall dining experience.   Cakes look lovely and again fresh and homemade but alas we never had room... next time!!",

(I don't think they do food in that part.) The menu is small but varied with breakfasty things which are on the cheaper side, and lunch things which are a bit higher, but not ridiculous for what they are.  Also, you have to know you're paying a bit extra on everything for the place. The tea isn't great, I've gotten English Breakfast and Earl Grey, and both were lacking.

A bright open dining room with big windows above the streets makes you feel like you're in a secret place looking down on the city. Also the food here is great with an ever changing menu you are not bound to get bored.",

    "text": "I was unprepared for the vastness of Spoon. From the outside, it appears to be little more than a teaspoon, but once you've squeezed through the entrance and trotted up the wooden stairs, you emerge into a veritable serving spoon of a space; light, airy, and dotted with white muslin curtains, Spoon is a spacious joy.  Our table of ten, over to one side, included a nice squidgy pew along one of the walls, and nearby was a snuggling of Chesterfield armchairs (yes, that's totally the collective noun) in which I could imagine whiling away hours on end over a hot chocolate and a book. In terms of the place itself, no question, five stars.  It's a shame, then, that on this occasion the service was something of a letdown; we waited twenty minutes for our orders to be taken and a further hour for our food to arrive, though it was far from busy, and not a word was said on the delay. And once it had, nobody returned to check on us although I'd have loved another orange juice and was wedged between Yelpy pals on the squidgy pew so getting out was tricky.  I'd ordered the muesli and yoghurt. Perhaps I was imagining something a little more constructed, but what arrived was precisely that - a vast bowl of muesli with a slightly carelessly-shaped flurp of yoghurt across the top. It was very yummy, but the muesli to yoghurt ratio was large; more a case of too much muesli than too little yoghurt, and I ended up taking Jenna L's unused milk jug from her tea to moisten the remaining melee.  A trip to the toilets was a fun treat, though, decorated as they are with cuttings from old beauty magazines, all of them the print version of \"keep young and beautiful if you want to be loved\", which is highly entertaining reading while one carries out ones functions.  In short, I adored Spoon and really want to give it a better rating. I'm not sure what was up - at one point we were laughing because every single member of staff appeared to have vanished - but I fully intend to return here and give it another go. It HAS to be as good as it could be.  I'm not usually apologetic over a three star review, because it's a good rating - \"A-OK\" is fine by me - but would break my heart if \"A-OK\" were truly representative of somewhere that ought to be such a delight.",

In fairness, the meal I had today was nice (chestnut mushroom bolognaise with pearl barley) and variations on a vegetarian theme is always welcome. Was it mindblowing? Not really, but nice enough. I wasn't excited by the brunch offerings on this Sunday morning, so felt choice was limited for me. It's definitely an OK place to visit, you won't go wrong. Decor is nice and service is there in all of the right places.",
