    "text": "This was a terrible dining experience.  The place was empty when we arrived, so that should have been a clue.  The food and service were both awful.  We ordered some appetizers.  The \"vegetable chips\" were nothing more than the crumbs from the bottom of a bag of commercial vegetable chips.  The grilled king scallops were tiny, dry and overcooked.  I suspect that they were wet scallops, as they had no taste.  The crab cakes were just fried bread - not a bit of crab was detected.  This seems to be just a tourist trap.  There are so many wonderful restaurants in the area - do not waste your time or money at this place.",

    "text": "This was a spur of the moment pick for my group of 4 and Im mostly happy about it. I ordered a picanah steak of which they say is from Scotland and they personally dry aged it for 35 days. Though I am hesitant at those claims the atmosphere was great. The wait staff were ok, but the owner was fantastic. He is a Scotsman and a charming fellow that interacts with tables and lovely to talk to.   My steak was at first overcooked which is a shame for 32, completely overseared and over cooked. However the owner checks in and corrected this as well as a side we were never given immediately. He was very nice about it and put out the dish and steak. The steaks did take over 20min to cook each time and were both sub par tbh not what I expect for 32. The corrected one was medium rare on the rare side and a bit chewy and bland. Neither steaks had that unique dry aged flavour which led me to my doubts about their claims. The food as a whole though was great and I was the outlier in my party. Because the other dishes were reportedly so good, well presented, and an awesome owner Im giving them 4 stars however my steak was a 2.5 star experience and given the mistake on a 32 high end steak as well as each 20min cook time I would expect the dish to be at least partially comped. By the time my corrected steak came everyone was practically done eating. I would give this place a try but do be weary of the prices and steaks.",

Service and atmosphere were fine -- perhaps a tad warm in the restaurant but that's been my issue with most places in Scotland -- even when it's chilly outside there is no air circulating. To their credit -- they did turn the heat down from under our tables where it was blowing on our legs.  As for the fish -- it was all decent -- but a bit strange to order get Sea Bass and have it come stuffed with mussels and crab in a rich sauce. Same with the Seafood Crumble -- came coated with green breadcrumbs. I thought a crumble would be more like a chicken or beef pie (with seafood) but oh well.  Good fish should stand on it's own -- but every seafood dish had a variety of seafood - when I order Salmon or Sea Bass I want just that. And the heavy, buttery sauces were too much for me (and not shown on the menu). Maybe next time will try the steaks.",

The decor did not change at all from the previous owner (Steak and Mussel) who decided to close it down after their short stint.    I ordered the queenie scallops as a starter.  You get six tasty and succulent queenie scallops.  These morsels are beautifully seasoned to bring out its maximum flavour.  I proceeded to have the salmon with clam and mussel casserole as main. Salmon was roasted and I love the crispiness of the skin.  People used to discard skins but I think that it's the best part.  The mussels and clams were cooked separately and all of them married up just at the right time for the final presentation. Superb flavour, varied texture and pleasingly full after that.  Finally, the vanilla panna cotta as dessert.  Heavenly sin on a sea of berry soup. Texture is consistent and cleans the palate nicely just to end the meal.   I am glad the menu and food here impressed me since it just opened not long ago.  It's definitely a keeper.  Give it a try.",

    "text": "This was within a block of where we were staying so we decided it would be a lovely place for our monthiversary.   We ordered oysters to start and they were delicious. We always assumed all oysters outside of the Pacific Northwest would be brinier but not the case with these. They were medium sized but as sweet as the Kusshi oysters we get at home. Absolutely delicious.   The steamed mussels were cooked in a cream broth with garlic, wine and shallots I believe. The flavor was spot on. I wanted to try Scottish mussels as I've never had them before. The meat is much smaller than the ones we get at home but still delicious. My one complaint is that they were overcooked to the point of rubbery. With mussels this small, they really should know it just needs a little time to open up and steam and you're done.   My steak was overcooked. For a steak and seafood restaurant, I was quite disappointed. Another Yelper had the same exact complaint actually! Instead of suffering like her husband did in that review, I sent mine back. My medium rare steak was medium well or well done on the edges and I'm not paying 28 (I think that was the price) for an overcooked steak at a steak restaurant. I munched on the fried (chips as they call them in the UK) that came with the meal while I waited for my new steak. When it showed up, they were gracious enough to give me a new order of fries with it. Nice move! I love trying meats from different countries, especially steak. This was a cow raised in Orkney and man oh man was it tasty. The newly cooked steak was phenomenal and I didn't need much of my side ordered peppercorn sauce because the meat was naturally flavorful in a way I can't describe. The pea puree was really vibrantly green and tasty. The grilled tomato gets a groan from me because I'm so sick of it being paired with a steak. It's been a thing since the 90s (or that's when I can last remember) and I wish it would end.   The sticky toffee pudding was far too sweet for me. But then again considering what the dish name is...I sound like an idiot for saying that :p  The non alcoholic mojito was amazing. It was so flavorful and he muddled the mint really well. I would happily have him serve me that every day several times a day!  The service....I just...ugh. Our main server just appeared grumpy. Maybe because she's just not a smiley type of person but it felt really awkward and prickly. She wasn't mean or rude or anything, but it just wasn't warm and fuzzy for a restaurant that costs more than a lot of places and being less than a block off the lower end of the Royal Mile. Luckily, the other servers we encountered were all really friendly.  If visiting the city, I'd happily come here again because the food was tasty and the seafood was very fresh. I could do with a different server and pray that the steak is cooked correctly the first time, as are the mussels. Aside from that, it was a lovely meal with the best company one could ask for.",

Michael's Steak & Seafood came to mind after i'd read a number of good reviews on yelp and tripadvisor, so we booked a table for the saturday night.  we arrived a bit early for our table reservation but were shown to a table right away.  this was in the window right next to a flight of stairs and a bit out of the main body of the restaurant.  it felt a bit isolated so we asked to move which was accommodated to a better seat in the middle of the restaurant.  i know the idea was to put us in the window and make the restaurant look busier, but as there were free tables in better locations i was a bit annoyed they did this.  but they moved us without a hassle so that was fair enough.  the menu is True to the name- steaks and seafood are to the fore for both starters and mains.  i went with a smoked haddock and saffron potato terrine to start and the sirlion steak with chimichurri sauce for my main.  the boyfriend had the queenie scallops to start followed by the rib eye steak with peppercorn sauce for a main.  starters arrived quickly, pretty much just after we got our bottle of wine.  my terrine was good without being amazing and the queenie scallops while good were a fairly small portion for the prize.  the starter plates were only just cleared away before our steaks arrived for a main, so a bit of a rush through the meal which i hate.  but the steak was cooked well and had a nice beefy taste.  my chimichurri sauce was quite good but that wasn't a lot of it sadly.  i think the best part was my boyfriend's sauteed potatoes that were really moreish with the steaks solidly average.  we were offered dessert menus which we looked over and took some time to drink our wine as the whole meal so far had only been over the space of just barely an hour.  we opted for a sticky toffee pudding and walnut, almond, and caramel tart to end with amaretto liquer coffees to follow.  the sticky toffee pudding was really quite good.  my tart was not quiet what i expected being a pastry base filled with whole nuts mixed in a caramel type sauce.  it was ok but nothing more.  the amaretto coffees were quite good though.  so overall i was left a little underwhelmed with Michael's Steak & Seafood.  it was not the romantic dinner we'd hoped for on our anniversary night and the fact we had three courses, wine, and coffee we were only there for an hour and a half.  the timing of each course felt quite rushed and i didn't really feel like i could sit and enjoy my dinner.  they didn't need our table back so i'm not sure why everything was served so fast.  the staff are friendly though and the price is fairly reasonable but with so many options in edinburgh i don't think i'll be back.",

I was traveling solo and did not have a reservation, thankfully I was able to get a table by the window with a fantastic view! I would recommend making reservations though, because many people came in after me and got turned away because they were already all booked up. I started with half a dozen of raw oysters which were extremely delicious and a French martini. For dinner I ordered the filet mignon with mushy peas and fries. My steak was cooked perfectly and it was  presented beautifully. For dessert I had an mixed nut tart with clotted cream ice cream and it was fantastic!

    "text": "Glad to have tried this restaurant on our last day in Edinburgh. The staff were very friendly. For appetizers, we shared the mussels in ginger, coconut, and chili sauce. The creamy sauce was a balance of sweet and spicy. We also ordered grilled scallops. The scallops were smaller than a coin (5 total) and missing the \"seaweed crust\" as advertised. I do not believe that the price reflects the amount or quality of the dish. For the main, I had the salmon which came with potato chunks and mussels. The salmon was cooked to perfection, so soft, moist, and flavorful. Lastly for dessert, we had the caramel almond & walnut tart (topped with clotted cream). The caramel sauce, warm walnuts, crunchy almonds, crisp crust, and clotted cream worked harmoniously. Highly recommend Michael's!",
