    "text": "New Hot Pot is probably my closest take away, but it's also often my take away of choice even when I'm getting food delivered and have the option of pretty much anywhere.  It's a no-nonsense Chinese take away, they have an extensive menu covering all the basics, and I've never been able to fault anything I've ordered.   The spring rolls are great, and my go-to lemon chicken with fried rice has never let me down. They often have offers on if you spend a certain amount you get free items like prawn crackers.  Overall, it's not fancy and the prices reflect this. Good quality, quick service, dinner done.",

    "text": "This place is our local, as the staff are super lovely, the food is fast and always consistent. We've tried lots of dishes, my favorite being anything with veggies or shrimp. If you order over 15 pounds you get free prawn crackers and over 20 you get free spring rolls, which is nice. We order over the phone and it never takes longer than 20 minutes to get out food. The salt and pepper squid is nice as is the veggie hot & sour soup. I don't eat meat, but my boyfriend has had the ribs and he really likes them. The salted tofu is nice as well. They do seem to be mainly be a delivery based place, as there is always a JustEat guy collecting food, but it means it must be good, I can't speak for the delivery, but if you live near by and don't feel like cooking, this place is a good option.",

    "text": "A decent enough local Chinese takeaway, most of their business seems to come from telephone order or just-eat meaning deliveries can be a bit slow. If you actually venture into the New Hot Pot, you normally have to wait no more than ten minutes, however you do have to tolerate a lime green and red painted interior...  The food is tasty and I prefer their fried rice and noodles to any of the other Chinese establishments in the area. Nothing particularly special but a solid reliable takeaway. I just wish they had thought about the colour scheme, suddenly it makes sense why most orders are deliveries!",

    "text": "This restaurant had friendly staff but horrible food.   15 per person for unlimited food for 2 hours. 2 for a soft drink with free refills.   Staff was nice and suggested we try a bit of everything. After having brought chicken feet advertised as sweet chilli chicken, and eaten raw crabe (tasked very bad), my tummy started to hurt. I went to the toilet that was dirty.   The concept is good where you can cook your own food in a hot pot but the food is very cheap quality. We weren't sure what we were eating most of the time.   Very overpriced for what it was offering. We always thought that seeing Chinese people eating in a Chinese restaurant was a good sign but not in this case. I guess it is the cultural differences in taste.   Would certainly not recommend and almost threw up in their toilets + in the car.",
