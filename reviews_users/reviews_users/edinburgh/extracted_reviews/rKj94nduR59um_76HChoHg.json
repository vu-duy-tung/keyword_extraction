    "text": "Been here many many times for food and in my opinion it's the best burger in Edinburgh. BUT tonight I'd finished work and just wasn't in the mood to cook or eat anything heavy. Now these boys have recently started to introduce classic basic burgers alongside their more inventive selection. I don't know if it was the organic sourced beef and the lack of any complicated topping allowing the flavours to shine through, but this was THE BEST MOTHER EFFING BURGER I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!  Sweet baby Jesus it was 100% perfect. Perfect.",

It was a toss-up between Bell's diner and feed, both being equidistant to my home.   So off I went to feed wanting to suss out this new local business and what it had to offer. And it was meh.   Feed is actually located inside St Vincent's pub. There's a little section in the back for the 'feeders' which I assume is an affectionate term but I just didn't like. You will then need to brave the masses to corner yourself off in an area out the back that's oh so lonely whilst the masses look onto their football game and scream and cheer nonstop.   So really one star for ambiance, it downright sucks if your looking for a semi quiet meal without sports crazed fans hollering every other minute at a screen you can't see.   Then begins the mission to return to the bar, again braving (and interrupting) the masses to order food. Now with 2 burgers, 2 fries, two drinks (beef and cider) and 6 wings the total came to 47.80- WAY too overpriced in my opinion, and at this point I started listing the higher end restaurants I could have gone to for the same/less cost in my head.   So then back to my seat. There is nowhere to look except the wall, it's really quite isolating. Then the food rolled on our after about 10 minites and I realised- I've eaten this food before! And the waves of memories set in, where I had actually had feed delivered to my home just after it first opened, and then I remembered the food being so uninteresting that I actually forgot about it.   Hoping for an improvement, I dug in.   Wings: with 6 for 10 I'd expect them gold plated, but they were your run of the mill cooked wings slathered in Buffalo sauce. The blue cheese and and celery were good though, I remember when they delivered they put the celery in with the chicken so I had limp and warm veggies the last time. Some improvement, not much.  Fries: just fries. From the frozen section. Maybe I was hoping they'd be hand cut or something? Anyway they were good but you could get fries like that anywhere.  Burgers: overdone and dry, just like last time. The bread is too chewy and needs to be heated in my view. The house made pickles are a nice addition but it was in with my blue cheese and chilli jam burger- made no sense and was not a good addition.   I love to support a good new business but I'm really struggling to find the good points here. The food was good, but there are better burger joints in Edinburgh.   This place is a pub and a poor attempt at encouraging people to use this place as a restaurant. The level of noise and crowding does not make for a good meal.   It was also not even memorable to me from the last time, and I rarely forget a meal. Overall this place is overpriced and not at all amazing. I'd don't feel the need to go back, and consider this fair warning if you decide to brave the masses too.",
