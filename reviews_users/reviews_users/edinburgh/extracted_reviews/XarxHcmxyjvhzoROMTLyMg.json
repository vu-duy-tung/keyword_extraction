    "text": "My first foray into foams of the food kind. Interesting and unusual flavours but totally mouthwatering to delicious. Love the old timber yard warehouse transformation into an uber cool crowd restaurant that isn't intimidating but welcoming in nature and oozing with wooden wisdom and style. The small entrees allowed us to choose a few to get a real sense and taste of the place. I had the Pea bite and the Halibut for main but it was the dessert plate that took my breath and tastebuds away. Strawberries in many different ways ala a roll up,a foam,a meringue a sweet haven of delight. You don't go here hungry but ready to experience the chefs offerings and the future of Edinburghs fine dining spots.",

Before we knew who they were or the menu, we were drawn in by the building.  The architecture is interesting and inviting.  But... when we asked about the restaurant, the hostess answered as if it were her parent's place.  Enthusiastic and educated on the menu, approach to food selection and the owner's philosophy.  Our server kept the same high standard.  We even had an opportunity for a quick chat with Andrew during dinner.  We could not have felt more welcome.  Dinner was spectacular.   Particularly the pairing of perfectly done duck with beet root.  I do not even typically care for duck.  If you would like your second Michelin star in a comfortable environment, you could not do better.  They are a tremendous asset to the community.  If you are not local, it would be worth the trip.  Just go.  Please.  You won't regret it.",

Its in an old timberyard obviously and has a lovely rustic charm, floor to ceiling wine rack and a wood burning stove. What more do you need?!  The staff were lovely - knowledgeable and enthusiastic and very helpful. Make sure you order the shrub cocktail its amazing with or without an oyster or two!   They have a 4 course set menu (you can have less if you want although you would have to be mad!) The idea is that you have a bite, then a starter, your main and a dessert. For 22 its pretty darn good value I think. All the dishes we had were tasty and delicious and with some opting for the a la carte we tried quite a few. My favourite was the soused mackerel and the venison. The place has loads of locally sourced, home smoked or cured and exciting dishes to tempt you.  I love this place, its a bit more expensive than some places but is perfect for a celebration or romantic dinner...",

Was kinda disappointed was although the ambiance and barn like decor was unique,  it was very expensive (we got the tasting menu that you can't really work out what the dishes will be because all ingredients are listed out -  much like the Kitchen and Gardener's Cottage) and portions were small so we left still hungry!  Good for someone with adventurous tastes/not for the faint of heart - as there were unusual cocktails combinations including things like charcoal cocktails, pigeon and heart!  Left with something more to be desired but good for that rare occasion..",

    "text": "This review is purely based on the service and not the food. I didn't go there for food, just some birthday drinks before I headed to dinner. I have heard rave reviews about their food, but knew they had drinks so thought I would try it. It is a beautiful space, we were seated near the entrance, which I assume is the waiting area, which despite the door opening and closing and letting the cold in, was ok.   We asked the staff member that sat us if we order from the bar or if someone comes to us, they said someone will come to us and gave us menus. So, over 10 minutes later no one had come to take our drink order. We should have just gone to the bar, but we weren't in a hurry so we thought maybe they were busy. Just as was about to give up and go to the bar someone came over and took our drink order, which was one beer and a gin and tonic. Needless to say, it took almost another 10 minutes before our drinks arrived. And no one came back to see if we wanted another round.   I'm sorry, I don't mind waiting if a place is super busy, but they didn't seem to be as I watched the person that took our order chat for a few minutes with a co-worker for a while before they even started making our drinks.   Being in the service industry, I would just have appreciated some honestly about if they were too busy to do drinks for us or if it would be quicker at the bar. I will at some point go back in for food as I don't feel like this typical for their service at Timberyard, but I was pretty disappointed with having to wait 20 minutes for two basic drinks.",

    "text": "birthdays call for special celebrations and with that in mind, my other half booked Timberyard for my birthday treat :)  i've long had this place on my list as restaurants that i must go to in Edinburgh, but just never seemed to make it along.  so i was well excited when it was a sunny evening, we'd had a pre dinner cocktail and were wandering along in the warm(ish) evening for an excellent meal ahead.  what i immediately liked about Timberyard is the restaurant itself.  the once industrial space is decorated quite simply with white and neutral tones, tartan throws over some chairs, tables made out of big slates of wood, and some tasteful pieces of art placed about.  there is also an outside bit, but i didn't have a wander there but i'm sure it's just as tasteful as the rest of the restaurant.  once seated we were offered two menus, the a la carte or the tasting menu.  after a glance at both we opted for the tasting menu (without the matching drinks) and a glass of sparkling english wine for an aperitif.  now it's hard to go back through all the courses that we had, it's 8 courses but you get a few extra bites at the beginning and a palate cleanser before your desserts.  of particular highlight was the prawn with fennel foam, the duck cooked two ways with butternut squash and shitake mushrooms, and the smoked halibut with lobster.  the beef was also particularly tasty and also the small bites we had at the start especially the egg yolk with onion salt and asparagus and radish for dipping.  to say the menu is creative is probably an understand.  all the food was fresh and nothing at all similar to dishes i've had before.  the tastes were subtle but well blended and the portion sizes were spot on for a tasting menu.  i left comfortably full but not stuff or hungry.  the wait staff were excellent, which to be fair i would expect of a restaurant of this kind.  but they were really faultless, polite and helpful being there when we needed them to be but also letting us just get on with the meal as well.  all the dishes were well timed, so while we were there for over three hours it didn't feel like a long time at all.  also a complete side note, but the toilets were really excellent.  i know this is an odd thing to comment on, but i feel the need to share.  they were down the stairs from the restaurant built sort of into a rock wall with the same minimalist/nature decor as the dining room.  they were super clean and just super nice and as a bonus they weren't freezing which the majority of other restaurant toilets are in edinburgh, which i have to say really shows the quality of the restaurant.  the only downside of this restaurant is that it isn't cheap.  the tasting menu is 70pp without the drinks and the cheapest bottle of wine starts at 28.  so it's definitely a special occasion place instead of an every day place.  however, i'd happily pay the price to dine there again as it was probably one of the best meals i've ever had.",

    "text": "Now this place really floats my boat!! Before I start its a belter! The restaurant itself is stunning - reclaimed wood dominating the tables, small number of art pieces and would you believe I even noticed the radiators! Yes the radiators! We opted for the 6 course tasting menu and paired wines, we couldn't quite bring ourselves to do the 8 course menu. All food is seasonal and local so it is constantly changing. We had raw venison, crab, duck, trout, lamb or halibut for the fifth round (so we had one of each) and topped off with a refreshing sorbet and buttermilk biscuit. The wine pairings were clever including non fermented sherries through to cider through to small batch hand crafted reds and whites. We couldn't fault a single thing!  Now finally the service - we must have had 6 servers possibly more throughout the evening and every single one as courteous, knowledgeable, friendly as the next one. In truth this made the evening, they have it down to an absolute tea! Now there's always a bit of a niggle with any restaurant and this is no exception, so I want to ensure this review is balanced and not completely gushy - the gripe at this restaurant  was the paper napkin! Yes beautiful antique cutlery sat on top of a paper napkin. Other than that simply spectacular, we will be back!!",

    "text": "My impressions were gathered over a couple of visits not long after this place opened.   Love the interior, they are trying something straight out of a Williamsburg warehouse with the exposed wood and large open space being very considerate to the old building. The lighting is great and all the staff very helpful and exude a cool without pretension. I used to come to this place when they did illegal parties in it during it's time between an actual joinery yard and now so is interesting to see the transformation. Always noise complaints from the neighbours when I was there, I wonder how much they had to spend on sound proofing!!  Wine list and cocktails are very good, competitively priced with an eye on local sourcing. Had a couple cocktails and they didn't disappoint, Nyetimber is listed which is always nice to see and keenly marked.  What really let me down is the food here. For an Edinburgh local perception I think they hit all the high notes however for me it was lacking in several aspects. Edinburgh excels in many of these places that are aspiring for the style of substance brigade. If the food could be as good as the space suggests it would be amazing. Cooking was a little sloppy and it was a shame with the great ingredients they are obviously trying to show.  I believe this is a family run affair, with their son headlining the kitchen. (as of the last time I went). I think they need some other influences. They are obviously great restaurateurs (although I did not particularly like their previous incarnations, but they must have had something successful as they were in existence for so long.) But maybe a couple more stages and some outside influences might help bring the food up to the level that the interior demands.",

We were early for our table but had heard they do good cocktails so we thought we would have one or two before dinner.  We were lucky to get a seat on the sofas beside the wood burning stove - just what we needed after the walk in the cold!   The menu is simple with only 3 choices per course, but everything is fresh, tasty and beautifully presented.  There are 4 courses to choose from, an amuse bouche type course, and then starter, main course and dessert.  They also serve some very tasty bread, ours must have come from the oven as it was still warm!   As it was January the menu was more gamey with both Vension and Pigeon appearing on the menu.  Being not a big meat eater I was happy that there was a good veggie option for each course as well.  The serving staff were pleasant and well informed about each dish they were serving.  In some aspects the service may have been a bit on the slow side, however it was such a lovely space with a relaxed atmosphere (plus we weren't in a rush) that we didn't mind!  I look forward to returning in the summer to be able to sit outside in their garden and also to see how their menu changes with the seasons!",

We arrived at 8.30 and finished at 11.30, having waited endlessly for 3 courses. They have an over complicated (although very short) menu involving two levels of starter and if you skip the smallest level they can't cope with serving the second level while others are eating the small portions. The wines were overpriced (30 to 150) and the wine list ( a printout) , was pretentious, and  out of date. The red- (Crozes Hermitage- we chose (at c 50?))  was ok but the Sancerre (white) was not and we sent it back, choosing the cheapest white wine on the list after that. The whole thing was just too pretentious and c400 for six including 3 bottles of wine was too much.",

    "text": "Timberyard came recommended by one of our servers from Ledbury.  They were pretty booked up, but we were able to get a 9:30pm Tuesday reservation for 1 of the 2 nights we were in Edinburgh.  The setting is very unique with lots of wood, high ceilings, and a sort of barn/loft feeling.  There are 4, 6, and 8 course options with pescetarian and vegetarian versions available.  Since we got there at the last seating, they had only the 4 and 6 course.  We opted for the 6 course (65 per person).  To start:  - Malt bread with whipped compressed butter and herbs - Seed cracker with roe, onion, and a burnt apple sauce - Mushroom and tarragon broth over raw mushrooms: a bit under-salted for me. The bowl sat in a larger bowl of porcini mushrooms, and I wished I could have gone for some of those  Drinks:  12 each. 1. Tomato, stout, peat, rye: very peaty and spirit driven with light tomato flavor - very interesting, but you need to like peaty whisky (which I do) 2. Pickled nectarine, spruce, mead, whisky: lighter, slightly fruity and effervescent, probably the sweetest of the ones we tried. This is a good one to start with 3. Beetroot, damson, lovage, and rye: it looked like beet juice, but it was well balanced; the lovage added an almost medicinal herb flavor  4. Bramble, egg yolk, vinegar, eau de vie: you could taste the vinegar like a light shrub. The yolk was interesting since most drinks use egg white  We also did some wines by the glass, which come in 125 ml pours. They have a pretty extensive wine list with a lot of wines I've never heard of before.  Food: 1. Smoked eel: served warm, with beets, horseradish, and buttermilk 2. Raw scallop: diced with apple, topped with a bright green parsley sauce, sliced celeriac, and smoked roe. This was a good crudo dish  3a. Plaice: with oyster leaf and oyster, tons of flavor  3b. Mallard: the other option for this course, with fermented grains and chantarelles. The mallard was medium rare, a bit gamey for me, but it was good  4. Duck egg: with shaved black truffles, artichoke, smoked butter, and mushrooms. This was definitely my favorite dish. The egg was soft cooked and runny, and I wiped up every last drop of this dish with my bread  5a. Trout: very tender, served with broccoli and herbs - a lighter dish 5b. Beef: super tender, medium rare, very well seasoned. It came with various carrots, kale, and cabbage. I preferred the beef for this course, but both were excellent 6. Berries: with noble fir snow, fruit leather, ice cream, buttermilk. This had lots of textures and colors and was a nice lighter dish   The main course portions were substantial and larger than I expected, which was great since I liked the beef a lot. I left very satisfied but not overly full.   There was a lot of attention to detail - all of the glassware (Riedel, interesting shapes) and dishes were carefully chosen and complemented the drinks/dishes well.  They were also great about refilling my water (complimentary sparkling water!), which I was basically chugging after a long day of travel.  All of the cocktails were innovative and used interesting seasonal ingredients in unusual combinations. I was very happy for some whisky based cocktails after being in London (so much gin..) and Dublin.  Since we were the last seating and opted for the 6 course, our meal was a bit rushed, especially for the earlier courses, but pacing got better in the end.  We were the last table left, but they still offered tea, coffee, cheese at the end, so it didn't feel like we were being kicked out.",

    "text": "Can't say anything about the food because I never got to go, but I can say their customer service was surprisingly poor.  Beware of their reservation policy. We has reservations for Tuesday and tried to cancel on Monday (full disclosure, I won a ballot for golf at St. Andrews which would have made us miss our reservations) and they were closed so we left a voicemail. Reservation cancellations required 24 hours or they would charge 50 per person--we booked way back in April so I completely forgot about this policy.  We got a call back Tuesday morning and I spoke with the girl and said maybe we'd be able to make the 9:30 sitting and she agreed--if she had told us the policy we wouldn't have pushed it.  We got delayed at St. Andrews and I called them early in the afternoon to let them know there was no way we would make it.  I saw a charge on my credit card the next day after which I called them to reason with them. The guy whom I spoke with never called me back when he said he would so I called back later that afternoon and spoke with a Woman who I'm pretty sure is part owner. I explained my situation and she explained how people like me are a blight on the industry in those exact words and that they still hadn't made a decision on refunding me. She never returned my call and the charge stuck on my card. She told me that the table would have sat empty and that they were turning many people away for the reservation. I gave 3 hours notice, so I'm not sure how that was the case and we tried to give the proper amount of notice to cancel but they weren't even open. It was fringe festival and Edinburgh was jammed so it's difficult to buy how she was both turning people away but couldn't fill it later.  I even called back later and asked if they would credit me for lunch the next day and was lied to about it being booked solid for lunch as I checked and there was still online availability.  I completely understand the policy, I've been all over the world and eaten at some really nice tables which have similar policies. I can tell you that there is almost always exceptions and flexibility to said policies and an element of customer service as situations arise.  Refunding half my money or having us for lunch the next day would have been sufficient to me but the way we were treated was like we were people trying to cheat them. I was really looking forward to going and ended up super disappointed.  I'm sure the food is great etc but it's tough to get behind someone's business when you're treated like this.",

    "text": "What a wonderful addition to the Edinburgh dining scene!  Came here with my husband for his birthday and the evening was lovely all around.  We ordered the 6 course tasting menu (also added on were 2 amouse bouches as well as a tiny cake for my husband and petit fours at the end) with drinks pairings and the meal was one of the best we've had this year.   Started off with a cocktail from the small but interesting list.   My trout main was so moist and delicious, gently cooked and incredibly flavorful. My husband's lamb main was also gently cooked to perfection and not heacy or gamey like poorly sourced and prepared lamb can sometimes be.   Other standout dishes included a wee tarragon and wild mushroom chowder that we both could've easily downed by the gallon, it was just too good.  Torched mackerel with buttermilk and sorrel...  A giant duck egg cooked low and slow with foraged mushrooms and shaved truffles. Creamy, satisfying and packed with flavor.   The only blip was the pigeon course, which was kind of tough. Took a bit of elbow grease to slice through it.  We were both full and happy after the 6 courses, although we thought about going for the 8 earlier.   The drinks pairings were very well thought out. Mostly small batch wines from France, Italy and Germany. A lovely fizzy mead from London was paired with dessert. Most of the wines would be fine to drink on their own, but they paired beautifully with their respective courses.   The wee cake they gave my husband was a beautiful pleasant surprise. Delicious too! The vanilla sponge was somehow dense but incredibly light at the same time.   The interior is airy and relaxed. You're having a premium dining experience with outstanding food and knowledgeable staff that seem to very much appreciate good food and drink themselves.   Can't wait to come back!",

To be fair, the wait staff are attentive, have been trained well & are polite, but they are all very young & foreign, so likely have no clue what this all costs.   There's far too much emphasis placed on drink pairing per course & very little thought or consideration given to those who might just want a glass of wine with the main dish. Wine glass sizes are about half of what you would expect at other places. Time between dishes was lengthy, & without the drink pairing, your wine (if white) is just getting warm - seems they just expect you to drink it & order more.   I had the Scallop & Cod, which with the vegetable sides were both bland & very boring - I sear a better scallop myself at home & with respect to cod, grabing a fish supper at the chippy round the corner would be more satisfying - sorry, but this is True. No cheese plate option over dessert (berries), which with the amount of good locally sources cheeses in Scotland, is amazing.   Just not worth 130 for two people. Try somewhere else.",

I would say this probably has a rustic timber setting (from the name) atmosphere wise with fine dining quality type of food.  Portion wise, I have to warn you that it is very artistic on a tiny side.  A bit annoyed by it as I believe they shouldn't be too stingy with it.  I am unsure what they are trying to achieve with this and probably the reason why they lost a star.  I only realised that portion were smaller on my second visit after about 1 year.  I was not impressed by it when I have actually recommended people to this restaurant and was a bit embarassed by it after I went back.  Because I believe all great restaurant should have at least some good value in them before I go back again and recommend it to anyone.  That said, it is still on the top of my favourite restaurant in Edinburgh.  I hope they keep up the good work to obtain that star.  This should not be missed when you visit Edinburgh.. if they have a table for you of course.",

    "text": "Recently visited this restaurant on a business trip to Edinburgh (i'm from NYC).  Coming from one of the restaurant Meccas of the world I may be a bit more critical than others.   The menu is set up for options of the sets of pre-fixe courses: 4, 6, and 8 with an option of wine pairing as well.  It does not mention it on the menu but you can also do an a la carte as well if you wanted, say, both of the starter options.   Ambience:  Overall I found the space to be a bit too cavernous for my liking.  The online pics make it appear to look like a minimalist rustic space which it achieves but in the evening it just seemed a bit empty despite most tables being full.  It's definitely a quiet date place rather than a \"fun\" spot to go with a bunch of friends.  I was alone and it wasn't the right spot for that.  Food:  They source local and fresh ingredients.  The food is prepared very well.  The portions are very small but they do place a lot of emphasis on presentation and flavor combinations.  The favorite was the the raw beef starter.  I only tried 3 plates as I had eaten not too long before. The scallop dish had two very small scallops.  The duck was one cross slice of breast and a tiny piece of confit and heart.  Service:  Waiters were quite pleasant overall.  Service was slow.   The down time between dishes was probably 20-30 minutes and the dishes so small that they can be eaten in less than 5 minutes taking very slow bites.  I actually was never asked if I wanted another drink.   It was not busy in there by any means.  Not sure if this is always the case or was just the night.  Overall:  I always appreciate restaurants that source local ingredients and creatively prepares them and Scotland produces some of the finest seafood and meat in the world.   The concept is good but I just don't love pre-fixe formats.  The portions are tiny and the price is high.  On a date with the 8 course meal with lots of time to get to know your partner I could recommend it.  By yourself just looking for a good local meal I may move on.  I think the website was deceptive in that I thought it would be kind of a cool casual \"farm to table\" type place where you could enjoy some friendly banter with other patrons, but it is really more of an upscale restaurant with rustic features.  As always your mileage may vary.",

To my untrained taste buds, everything was simply amazing. The pairings of spices, sauces, and ingredients were unconventional and unique. Same goes for the cocktails and there was a long list of whisky choices (no surprise there) as well as local brewery beers. The menu was sectioned into Bite, Small, Large, Sweet, it was perfectly filling to have all four courses per person.  The interior was extremely stylish, down to the restroom area (with a soundtrack of thunderstorm that is oddly soothing). The music in the main dining hall was a mix of typical indie but was played at a minimum level and will not disturb conversations. The staff were well trained, attentive but not overbearing.",

Tis was delicious on the palate.  It went well with all 4 courses I had choosen from the menu.  The little bite was a lobster broth. Starters was a crab, creme fraiche, horseradish, spiced bread.   I choose smoked pork loin, belly, onion, artichoke for the mains and to finish was Marshmallows, chocolate, spiced oats, fig, milk.  The serving are quite small but I was quite full by the end - quite full and happy!  I'm chuffed to say we have something like this in Ediburgh and I've finally now experienced it!",

It was good, presentation amazing, but unlike similar style restaurants where the Flavors are so well thought out it baffles your mind, it seems the ability of the chef to truly understand complex tastes is simply missing. The food was... Bland and not interesting. Note I had 6 plates... That's a lot of sampling. Same conclusion.   Food is not bad, but certainly nothing like you expect based on the presentation, ingredients,  and the cost.  Now... Ambiance? Freaking stellar. Service? Very very nice. But food, which is why I came, makes me think I am in an experiment that never actually went anywhere. Presentation Looks cool though! Too bad that does nothing to the flavor.",

    "text": "Hands down, #1 for us in Edinburgh.  Had a great time here. From the service to the drinks to the food, everything hit just right. Super casual but nothing is taken for granted. Servers bounced around but this did not detract as they were all knowledgeable and friendly. They even had gluten free bread for my boyfriend which was as good as my regular bread.  Food was interesting and well presented. Wines and cocktails were varied and reasonably priced. I could have eaten everything on the menu and one day I hope to return and do just that!  We should have come back for a second dinner instead of M*** G********.",

The wine and beer list is intimidating - sadly no South American wines.  The food is extremely well presented on the plates, like artistry. The portions are on the small side, maybe I am just a bit piggish. One should probably go for the 6 course meal rather than the 4 course meal. In my opinion the dishes all lacked seasoning, it is almost as though they ran out of salt that night. My cod was also a bit overcooked. The dessert was an absolute delight.  I will be back.",

    "text": "I want to give 3/2 stars for them mostly based in my vegetarian experience there. The meat eaters were way happier with their dishes so I guess it was not a wise idea going there to try their vegetarian 4 course menu. The most disappointing dish was the one I had highest expectations, it had caramelised   onions, some root vegetables I can't remember now and one of my favourite ingredients: black truffle! And for mine and everyone else surprise this dish was just lacking so much flavour that we could believe, the shaved black truffles tasted like dried potatoes and that really shocked us, since truffles are difficult to disguise in a dish. Service was good but quite slow, as we were catching up with my sister-in-law that haven't seen in a while we didn't really bother about the long waiting time for each dish. Wine list was quite small and expensive. The best part of my dinner was the strawberry dessert! Really yummy! Be aware that you will need constant explanation about the dishes, we didn't know more than half the ingredients listed there, the staff was helpful though.",

    "text": "An even better 5 stars than last time.  We brought my parents here this past weekend and everything was spot on.   I think that the creativity of the dishes, the staff, and the little extra touches are what really do it for Timberyard.  I forgot to mention in my first review that when you sit down you are treated with warm bread and, as was the case last  weekend, whipped butter with crowdie, accompanied by juniper smoked pepper and something green (I keep forgetting) with the salt. OH SO MUCH HEAVEN. Honestly, warm bread and butter is great enough, but the crowdie and the seasonings sent this overboard. OH and there was smoked bone marrow too. UHN.  Full after the bite, starter and main, we oped for coffee (and a cheeky mead for me), which came with the standard fabulous little sweet bites.   Between courses we popped out into the garden to see the chickens and quails (cute and little) and decided it would be a gorgeous place to come for a cocktail on a sunny afternoon (add that to the list after a flush month!).  If I could come here once a month, I would. It's just fantastic.",
