    "text": "Not the best chippy and definately not the worst. This has been my local for a long time, I dont eat chippy food that often but what I get here is consistant and it is round the corner. :D  Plus points   - Chips are pretty good - there is seating - pizzas are average, but consistant and inexpensive.   - the haggis is great - fish is okay - good lunch time deals - always open it seems these days  Minus  - It is a bit average in terms of quality - Some items are a little pricy  Noticed the comments from JoeA below. Yep that sounds like Mr Salvatore. I kind of like that he doesnt hide his disdain for people, it comes accross refreshing at times especially in Marchmont.  When you see what he has to put up with then yep I can understand.",

    "text": "It's something to be said for a guy who takes the mick out of almost every customer that comes through his door. Wow, this guy's got a bad attitude.  Stopped by here on a night-out to line the stomach before it was too late and the drinks went to my head. Right from the off the old gent behind the counter (Salvatore I presume?) oozed condescention, talking to me as if I was one of the many drunk-out-their-eyeballs students that are his locals, and exuded an air of indifference as to whether he retained my business or not.   The man seemed bored. But as I was already in a good mood, I decided to ignore and chose a chicken leg to fill the void. When I asked how long this would take I was met with a sigh, a roll of the eyes, and \"well.... about 7 minutes... give or take,\" in his altogether 'in my own time' attitude.  So taking a seat, I was then privy to the out and out insults he barrelled at the next two students to pop in the door. Admittedly they were more obviously drunk, slurring their words, indecisive, etc. So Salvatore let rip, safe in the knowledge they probably wouldn't remember.  When it came time to pay, the bill was 4.55. As I had a pocketful of shrapnel, and in a bid to relieve myself of a dozen 5ps or so (hate 5s.... hate em!) I had taken the initiative and pre-counted out 5.05, expecting a solid 50 pence piece in change.  No. He counted about 15p of it then dumped it all in the till. Brilliant. So I took the liberty of pointing out how much money had been ladled in his hands.... to which his reply was silent and clearly irritated: he opened the till and gave me 1 change.  Any other person in my shoes, hacked off with this guy's attitude, would've taken the money and run. I however, took more pleasure in pointing out that he did in fact owe me 50p and not the whole pound. A lovely way of telling him how thick he was and satisfying me tenfold.  Why 2 stars? The chicken was alright.",

    "text": "Living on Sciennes Road a few years ago, I was pretty much halfway between Salvatore's and Franco's, and like a East Coast versus West Coast rap battle covered in batter, war raged every time we'd go for a takeaway. Franco's slightly won in the end, just because it's a little bit cheaper for what you get but Salvatore's is still pretty good.  It's a chippy so you pretty much know what you're going to get. Grease, fat and batter are the operative words here but it's all pretty tasty stuff. The sausages are good, as is the haggis and the chips are fair enough. It's still pretty cheap as well, which is always a bonus, and the staff are friendly.   If you live in Marchmont, you can do a lot worse than here for all your chippy needs.",

    "text": "It's hard to get too excited about a chippy, but as far as they go this is a fairly good one. In fact, it was here that I first tried Deep Fried Haggis (scots will quite literally deep fry anything!) altough they do serve pizzas, a few pastas and all the usual greasy fried things that come with chips.  It's definitely one to stay away from if you're even vaguely watching your figure - when a friend of mine ordered a cheeseburger, naively expecting a burger and some cheese in a bun. Instead, they put a slice of cheese between two burgers and dep fried the whole lot, then served it on top of a huge pile of chips.  Greasiness aside, the staff are friendly and it's not bad value for money either.",

    "text": "Salvatore's is a decent chippy which serves good, standard food at reasonable prices.  I live just along the road from these guys and so visit every now and again when I can't be bothered cooking.  The service is fast and friendly and the place is clean with some seating for those sitting in.  The menu has a good selection of fried fish, suasages, haggis and black pudding as well as pizzas and kebabs.  Most of it is well priced and their battered sausage and chips, my personal favourite, costs only 3.50.   Their chips are delicious and are hardly greasy at all, whilst their batter is thin and crisp.  If you're in the area and fancy a great, cheap takeaway then Salvatore's is ideal.",

    "text": "Oh great, another s**t Edinburgh chippy. Not quite as bad as the others, but not great either. The chips here are like every where else. Chip shop chips. All the same. The portion sizes are a little less generous but I think that's probably a good thing - chippys always give you too much.  But again, the fish! It's rubbish. It never tastes of anything. At least the batter here is nice a crunchy, but batter can only do so much for a crap piece of fish. And it's expensive too - nearly 6 for a fish supper, which is ridiculous.  One thing Salvatore's has got in its favour is the pizza. They have a separate pizza chef and the stuff he turns out is really quite good. And the pizzas are more reasonably price too. But the fish is rubbish. And Mr Salvatore is a West Ham fan. Bleurgh.",

    "text": "My flatmate quite enjoys going here whenever he can't be bothered to cook himself an actual meal. Because the chips are really cheap and plentiful. I've only ever been in a few times and mainly for pizza. That is, when I'm not up for splashing out on Delicious Italian.   Their pizzas are quite standard. But they do have this one kind with garlic and aubergine which is pretty amazing. I mean, you don't wanna watch him putting the thing together, because everything comes out of jars and cans, but it's so garlicky and so cheesy and so salty!  I wouldn't tell anyone: you must go here. I wouldn't rant and rave about it, because it just isn't that spectacular. But. It's right downstairs. So if I have someone over who's desperate for food, cheap, greasy food, I send them there. It's all circumstantial, really. And in the right circumstance, this place can be exactly what you need.",

You always know what you're getting here; good, greasy chippy food, fantastic when this is exactly what you want.   The chips are crispy, the pizzas are awesome.   Just don't order a deep-fried pizza; I'm sure there is a reason how come you can't get them outside of Scotland.",
