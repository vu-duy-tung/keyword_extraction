    "text": "We stumbled upon this place while exploring Edinburgh and I'm glad we did. We took a picture of the menu and kept along with our day, only to come back immediately that night for dinner.   We dined in the restaurant and had the whole place to ourselves. A lot of deliveries went in and out, hence the name but I can't rate their deliveries (although their vehicles, advertising and presence around town must have cost them a lot of $$ in investments).  We ordered the Palak Paneer and the Chicken Tikka Wrap. It came with a drink included so splurged and got the Pellegrino lemonade, all 39 grams of sugar. The paneer with rice was amazing and the wrap was delicious, with plenty of fries as well.  The service was great, the gentleman may have had it easy as we were the only ones in the restaurant. If you walk by this spot in Edinburgh, UK save yourself some time and don't keep walking, just head right on in and you won't regret it.",

    "text": "Sorry guys, whilst I enjoyed (most) of the food I ordered, I can't bring myself to give Slumdog Delivered higher than 2 stars, and I'll tell you why.  The website is slick. They've got their own branded cars, and a fancy looking shop front. There's clearly been a lot of money put into opening Slumdog. Maybe that's why the prices are so RIDICULOUSLY HIGH. Seriously, curries are at least a tenner, which is really, really high for an Indian takeaway. That could almost be justified if the food was out of this world amazing, which it wasn't. I mean, as Indians go it was pretty good but was it 3-4 more than most Indians good? No. We spent 35 on two curries, two rice, one naan and two portions of poppadoms (including delivery charge), which is at least 10 more than we pay anywhere else. I'm not sure why I clicked 'order'.  To be fair, the portions were big, but still not big enough to make up for the cost.  The menu itself has some interesting inclusions (I quite fancy the Sweet Potato Tikka), but is actually fairly limited. Arguably this is a good thing (as opposed to the Jack of all trades, Master of none approach that many takeaways take), but it's also frustrating when you realise your favourite dish isn't available, or if it is it's only available in lamb, for example.  But by far the worst crime was the one committed against poppadoms. I LOVE poppadoms. They're my favourite part of an Indian, so to have them ruined is like a personal affront. Firstly, the poppadoms were 1.50 with no indication of how many was included in a portion. It turned out to be three. Three tiny poppadoms I hasten to add, not the big dinner plate sized ones everywhere else sells for 50-70p each. They were all singed around the edges. And they were flecked with some sort of spicy seed. If I'd ordered 'spicy poppadoms' that would have been fine, but the website didn't let on that I was ordering anything other than plain. Urgh. They were nasty.  So whilst I feel a bit mean giving Slumdog 2 stars (I'd rated it 3 originally, then changed my mind), it just didn't meet 'A-OK' for me. The food was tasty, the portions fairly big, and the delivery was swift. But the prices are outrageous, the menu is limited and the poppadoms were horrible. I had high hopes and they just weren't met.",

    "text": "I wasn't quite sure what to expect from Slumdog but they have a strong brand and their presence around town is what lead me to order when last minute takeaway was required on Saturday night.  Sometimes ordering takeaway can be frustrating experience. I never have cash and so always end up having to attempt to pay through some janky website where I am never quite sure if my order went through. So I appreciate that Slumdog have a decent, easy to use website. They sent me a text telling me it would take an hour; in fact it only took 30 minutes with a second text informing me it was on it's way.   We had a tikka masala, chill chicken, onion bahji, a naan, a roti and a rice. This came to 35 which, as has been noted, isn't exactly the cheapest. When it arrived we realised this was far too much food. The curries are big; next time I'd order one between two and maybe get one of the smaller dishes. There was plenty leftover for me to have another filling meal the next day.  Is it the best Indian I've ever had? No. But it all tasted good and I enjoyed it. It's well presented and convenient and that's the reason I'll likely order again.",
