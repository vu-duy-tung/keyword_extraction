It has a good selection and is located right in the heart of Edinburgh with great transport links just a few steps away.  There not much to say about it to be honest it really is just as it says, a food court.",

    "text": "Awful place. Staff are very rude and have a vendetta against young people. I have witnessed them throwing young people out of the establishment for doing absolutely nothing wrong. I now hear that they have had alarms installed that can only be heard by young people. This attitude is absolutely appalling.   It seems to just be the kids who dress in black who they target. I've seen kids wearing sportswear being left alone while they constantly try to shoo the gothic kids away. They are discriminatory pigs and nothing makes my lunch break worse than seeing four security guards gang up on two little girls for nothing other than how they are dressed. Something must be done about these horrible people and how they operate their business is not acceptable.",

Princes Mall Food Court may be a bleak, depressing and foul-smelling experience all rolled into one, but it's also quite unforgettable for those same reasons.  Effectively a collection of chain fast food joints surrounding a sprawling mass of cheap late 80s tables, the first thing you'll notice is that the punters are all under 16 or over 65. Those that aren't are rarely in possession of all their limbs, or teeth.  I'm not the type to snicker at fast food to try and convince both myself and others I've a shred of class, so I can appreciate the outlets here for what they are, and to some extent, enjoy them. It's just the customers that make it difficult. Every time you look up, you will definitely catch a glimpse of someone who's appearance and / or eating habits puts you off your lunch, so your best bet is just to keep your head down and get on with it. This can actually make your saturated fat-laden feast that bit more enjoyable, as you'll likely concentrate solely on the eating to blank out the misery of your surroundings.  It stinks too. Really bad. Yet it has to be experienced at least once, preferably via KFC or Harry Ramsden's. Spud-U-Like looks very tempting as well and I'll go for that one next time I can muster up enough self-loathing to set foot in here.",

Just needed the caffeen to boost moral! Otherwise I hardly go in here unless I have to use the bathroom which cost 30P or so btw so make sure you have change on hand. Other then that really there isnt much to say about here. Gave the 2-star cause the place was clean and so are the loos.",

    "text": "Much like the whole of Princes Mall, the food court isn't anything special. The only thing it has going for it is it's convenient location to Waverly Station so if you're in a rush you can nip in and out before jumping on your train. In my case, I'll usually nip into Spud-u-Like which I think is the best of the bunch the food court has to offer and I can never turn down a baked potato with beans and cheese. Mmm.  If spuds aren't your thing then you can choose from the almighty Harry Ramsden's, McDonalds, Subway, KFC, O'Briens or Costa. Take your pick. The main downside, is the fact that this place feels like the most depressing shopping centre in the world so I wouldn't choose to eat here if I wasn't in a rush because it's not the nicest place to spend more time than you have to.",

You can take your chosen meal and sit in a sort of school dinner hall-esque formation, where you will undoubtedly find yourself nose to nose with other folk eating Big Macs with the mayo dripping out of it. Mmmmm, mmmm.  The toilets are quite clean though, probably because no-one wants to pay 30p to go in there.",
