    "text": "Just visited cafe cassia on Leith walk again I have enjoyed visits on previous occasions (hence this is not 1 star) however just for coffee and cake (on my cheat days).  On this occasion however I needed to stay on diet and had the displeasure of being served by a red headed seemingly polish lady (apologies if that is incorrect) who seemed almost offended by the idea of dietary requirements and the suggestion of possibly replacing any of the two items on the breakfast I asked them not to serve as I don't eat,  with a suitable alternative. At 6.80 for the small breakfast when i normally only spend 5 pounds for a coffee and cake I thought this was not unreasonable. I conceded quickly to paying for food I was not receiving and then to make matters worse she seemed have decided she didn't like me and her attitude did not make me feel welcome (the first time this had happened here) to cap it all off the breakfast was mediocre at best sausages tasted about 40% meat, the fried eggs were fairly bland and had hard yolks, nothing else about it is worth mentioning one way or the other however their coffee if pretty good  based only on this experience I would say go for a coffee and a cake as it is a beautiful little cafe however if you get the red head know what you are ordering and don't ask any questions  and yeah probably avoid the full breakfasts, enjoy!",

    "text": "Cassia is a great little Leith coffee shop in a place that used to be a cake shop. Super handy and useful for locals and office workers alike who enjoyed a nice espresso to go or sit in. All served under the scrutiny of its friendly and knowledgeable owner, Amir.  They offer soups, hot rolls, baked potatoes, toasties, salad rolls, bandari (an Iranian food, usually served in sandwich shops in Iran in the form of a sub or meal. It contains sausage, onion, tomato paste, ground chilli pepper and other spices), cakes, wraps and of course Artisan Roast Coffee. Cassia lovely stripped brick interior walls make it very homely and cosy indeed. WiFi is pretty strong if you're planning to use your portable devices for leisure or work. Cassia can get very busy during lunch time, for obvious reasons, so the start of the morning and mid-afternoon are the best times for a lazy munch & a coffee, or a San Pellegrino aranciata rossa. Certainly a place to visit more than once!!!",
