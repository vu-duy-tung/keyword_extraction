The portions could be a bit bigger for my appetite but then you just get to order more and have more tastes of different dishes! The flavours are all amazing and they do a particularly good spinach dish (Saam Savera I think). The prices are good, it's not expensive and it's always a treat to eat here.",

We have seen several changes of decor over the years, going from simple basic through to the special Indian plasterwork that was done in 2008. The menu has changed a lot over the years but everything we have tried has been delicious - perfectly cooked, perfectly spiced, perfectly presented. We are always spoilt for choice, everything on the menu sounds so good. We can't recommend it highly enough!",

I would eat there more often, except that it is so hard not to take a refill and end up overfull. Timing can sometimes be an issue when it is busy. If you arrive at the tail-end of the 12.30 rush, some of the dishes run low, and you may have to wait for a new batch from the kitchen.",

This place, which has always been a vegetarian restaurant used to be a great place to come to get food - whether it was a large group who were looking for something abit different, or just you and a friend looking for some quiet time, Kalpna could provide.  Now however, it has taken on a new role - it still tries to be the place where you can go for good vegetarian Indian food, but some of its sparkle has gone, and really I'm not sure what it is. The whole place just doesnt seem welcoming, and its abit too modern for my liking.  However, the food still remains great, and as ever the staff are friendly, so iots not like everything has gone down hill. I will be back here, although I might just have to put up with the new decor and general atmosphere.",

They have great vegetarian options though, so it was definitely worth it for that aspect. When we went this last time, we were still hungry after ordering and eating everything that we had to order another dish. I know that doesn't sound like a big deal, but I've never been to a restaurant where I had to order more food because I was still hungry, so that kind of turned me off a bit to it since the portions are so small.   Otherwise the service was decent and, again, the food was very tasty!",

    "text": "Having just finished exams, I visited Kalpna for the third time last night with my boyfriend, to celebrate.   Whilst I can understand the criticisms of others regarding the compulsory service charge of 10%, if you mentally calculate it while ordering your meal, it doesn't actually make this an expensive meal. Sure-it would be better if they let you decide how much of a tip you want to give regardless...   Aside from this, I cannot praise the food anymore than I already have. I went for a memorable masala dosa again, and it didn't disappoint. It was crispy, the filling was spicy and full of flavour, and the sauces absolutely delicious. I was offered a refill of the sambar when I eagerly ate it before touching the dosa. The peanut and chilli dip was really quite special, the coconut cooling and creamy as it should be. There were so many exciting flavours going on! Robbie's thali was equally exciting: he got a few fried starters like pakoras with two dips, 2 fresh-from-the-oven naan, two mini portions of curry: one aubergine, the other okra, a lentil dhal, steamed basmati rice and a cardamom and pistachio rice pudding. It was beautifully served on a traditional silver thali plate, garnished with salad. It looked doable, but he soon found himself struggling with a huge quantity of food. Fortunately, it was so good that he did find that extra room in his stomach for everything.   For pudding I opted for a saffron kulfi. It was creamy, extremely delicious and dense, unlike European ice cream with it softer and airier. The taste of saffron was very present.   The dosa cost 8.75, the thali 12.50 and the kulfi 3.50. Having tried just about every South Indian in town, I must emphasise that this is the most authentic. Dosas are naturally vegetarian, and the addition of chicken and other meat is a Western variation.   On a par with woodlands in London.",

The food was certainly interesting, although personally I was left underwhelmed.   We opted for the lunchtime buffet and at 7.95 per person, it seemed reasonably priced.  However, upon getting to the buffet table, the choice was very limited.  There were only three main dishes available,  a chick pea based dish, and two generic vegetable dishes which were very similar.  While the chick pea dish was delicious, the other two were rather bland and  left much to be desired.  However, the side dishes were interesting and included a deliciously greasy crispy naan.  The drinks were a bit pricey too. My mango lassi (yoghurt drink) was around 3 and wasn't quite as large as I'd hoped. Yet the staff were very friendly and the interior simplistic and well presented.   As has been mentioned in previous reviews though, you simply cannot beat the mosque kitchen for vegetable curry and I believe that had I not already been a regular there, I would be rating Kalpna more highly.",

Still, considering the dubious quality of the \"meat\" you often get in curry houses, perhaps it is one of the cooking styles most suited to carrot chompers. The curries here are good, but still can't beat the king of all veggie curries at the Mosque Kitchen.",

After some sickeningly sweet and over coconutty chicken tikka masala in London, this turned out to be one of the better surprises.  We just went to the market and had picked up a couple bags of food and drinks for breakfast. The waiter jokingly asked if we bought our own food.  I had paneer masala. It was rich and creamy if a little blend. I liked Vijay's Saam Savera better, nicely spiced and flavourful.  After the trip, I talked to someone at work who has lived in Edinburgh for years and he agreed that Kalpna was one of the better Indian restaurants around town.",

All the walls are covered top to bottom with little mirrors which in my point of view is a bit tacky and rather distracting. Other than this I am not big fan of the interior layout, the tables giving a feeling of limited space and too clustered together.   However, it's a decent vegetarian Restaurant in the area.",

    "text": "When traveling, travelers want to eat something familiar, and they usually turn to their native cuisine... or fast food. While in Edinburgh, I opted for the former. Being of Indian origin, I was looking for an Indian restaurant, hearing rave reviews about Kalpna from the hotel reception staff, I decided, it was worth a try. The restaurant is nice, with a casual ambience that very much reminds diners of the cuisine thats cooked within with thoughtful Indian decoration. The waitstaff were polite and helpful but not overbearing. The star of the show however was the food, the first day, we tried the Archana Thali and Thali Raj Bhog, which didn't disappoint. Being delighted with the experience, we visited once again, this time however we sampled the Tandoori Mix starter, which consisted of several vegetables and Panner being roasted in the Tandoor. We then ate, Dal Tadka, Bhindi Bhaji and Dum Aloo, along with Tandoori Roti, Garlic Naan and Chapati. All dishes were very tasty and enjoyable. However, the Dum Aloo, while tasty was unlike the Dum Aloo I have ever eaten before. My only gripe with the place are the restrooms, while sufficiently neat, they are located underground, beneath the dining room and are not lit very well, this has sort of an eerie effect and makes it seem a shady place, quite unlike the rest of the restaurant. To conclude, if you want a good, authentic Indian experience, go to Kalpna, you can't go wrong.",

When ordering we were told that pretty much every dish apart from the rice or nann was pre made and could not be made without onions and garlic, which was a big let down as all we could eat was the one panner dish. We did ask if a fresh dish could be made but he said no as everything is pre prepared even the bhindi and paneer dishes and no other fresh items were available, but then our waiter did attempt to have made a jeera aloo dish with mixed veg which wasn't on the menu, so thanks to him for that.   Finally, after paying a bill of 33 for 1 starter, two main dishes and two drinks we had to request the after dinner mints.   In terms of service, this place is not great, but the decor of the restaurtant is nice if that helps.",

Nonethess it was a very pleasant evening, they have a limited choice of wines from 7.99- 22, but carefully chosen to compliment the food on offer. We opted for the platter, at 16.99 which we thought was for sharing, but we ended up with one each, they looked a bit overwhelming at first, mainly because they took up every inch of space on the little table,however, the meal was delightful if not a bit confusing, as the starter, main course and dessert were all on the same platter, interesting indeed dipping a nan bread into a rice pudding, mmmm. The staff were welcoming and very pleasant. I would reccommend it for something different.",

Often some of the best food is actually in restaurants that are not exclusively veggie. However, the Kalpna has to be one of the most superior all-vegetarian Indian restaurants on offer. Their lunchtime special 'all you can eat' has been known to encourage embarrassing displays of gluttony. I could (and do!) happily eat platefuls of their delicately spiced, lightly fried potato fritters. Then I move onto their perfect lentil dahl and spinach saag. AND still I have room for a delicious authentic pudding - kulfi ice-cream laced with honey, pistachios and condensed milk. Feeling hungry yet?!",

We also got an order of the special kebabs, which were really tasty and unique. Made with kidney beans and chickpeas.

We were told that there would be a 20 minute wait for a party of 6, but when we arrived we were made to wait for an extra 20 minutes. When we were finally seated, it took them additional time to even get us a menu, and our tables weren't set. One waiter threw a handful of utensils on the table later on, which we were expected to distribute and set ourselves. We asked for water twice, but we finally only got it with our food, which again took a long time to arrive. Our Thalis had repeated curries, as if no one had even paid attention as to what was going on our plates. Finally, we were told that their machine wasn't accepting cards and that we'd have to pay with cash. As an Indian, I can confidently say that this restaurant is not a proper reflection of good Indian cuisine and customer service, and your money is better spent elsewhere.",

The only major disappointment was the veg samosa, came out hot but filling was not fresh and borderline stale - we did not complain about it but would not order again. When we decided to go there, were concerned about service issues reported in other reviews but did not notice any issues - food came out fast but we were also late in the day an hour before their closing time and that may have something to do with it. Big plus that they are an all vegetarian restaurant - would like to support them. Would love to go back to try other things. Price 4*, Food 4*, Service 3* - go give it a try when in Edinburgh - you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "I hadn't been in a decade but wanted to show my partner the place I used to frequent when I lived here. It didn't disappoint at all! Still the same amazing lunch buffet for a decent price.   There were three dishes, rice, pakora, naan, salad and sauces for you to enjoy. Dessert was 1 so we skipped it as we were already full anyway. The food was delicious. My partner didn't think much of it when I was describing it to her and how this was where we used to go for lunch meetings. But she was sold after her first bite.   I'm not even a vegetarian and I love this place. They're so creative with the dishes too. If you're looking for standard dishes you know like spinach paneer or something, you'll be disappointed. But if you're open minded and want the chefs in the back to surprise you, come give it a try! Today's most unique thing was the lotus leaf dish. It was sweet and sour with a bit of heat to it. I thought it was weird but in a good way so I had a few pieces.   The chai was also delicious. I loved how the sugar and cream/milk was on the side so you could make it to your liking.  We might come back one more time before we leave town.",

    "text": "Food 5 // Ambiance 5 // Service 4  Lunch buffet is ON POINT! 8.5 pounds for an unlimited amount of food! And good, wholesome, vegetarian, flavorful, bold food on top of that!! Honestly -- even though the choices of food were a bit limited,  there was enough diversity; I didn't fall victim to decision paralysis. Moving down the buffet table: dessert (gulab jamun, 1 pound), a salad station, a chutney station (tamarind, chutney, cucumber raita), puri (so soft!), roasted veggies (great spice profile),white basmati rice, chana (chickpeas) , yellow daal, spinach dish.   I had a bit of everything and then split the gulab jamun with my friend. The gulab jamun was divine! One of teh best I have had. We also ordered masala tea for two (not on menu, but definitely as for it. Takes a bit to come out but got in right in time for desser)   All in all -- I WILL be back! Everything tastes homemade and the lunchtime buffet is the perfect for either a quick or slow lunch; you get full autonomy! The traditional mosaic tile on the walls is so beautiful and different. Add this to your places to visit!",

For the quality and quantity you receive you'll go home with a full tummy and a happy wallet.   I love their dal it's delicious and their plain rice is wonderfully garlic. Also good are the various paneer dishes. They even have the most beautiful mango lassi I have seen, and it's absolutely delicious.   The downside was that their mango lassi was way over priced in my opinion. But this is a definite favorite in Edinburgh:)",

Just wish my stomach was larger. Clean and nice interior with brightly colored mosaics on the walls. The three of us shared the Bhindi masala (okra), dosa, nan, and another dish. We left delightfully stuffed and happy.  Bottom line: Don't dine here without ordering the dosa. Crisp, flavorful, and memorably great.",

    "text": "I'm sorry but I have to dissent from the majority of reviews about Kalpna, very flattering indeed; unfortunately my experience in this vegetarian Indian restaurant has not been completely satisfying.  The food was ok, I must say: I went for a main course of mixed vegetables and nuts pineapple with tandoori roti bread. Quite good, but not enough to make up for the service. Being lactose intolerant, I asked the waitress (twice) if it was possible to have the food without cream; she said that she was going to ask the chef and she would let me know. She didn't, and the food was served with cream anyway. Luckily I did notice it, and my intolerance is not that severe either, but I reckon they should pay more attention to such things.  The payment procedure has been very slow, and this as well because the waitress seemed very confused about payments by card and receipts, so that at the end she needed to ask another member of the staff that did it for her.",

However, when we walked in, the hostess/waitress greeted us with a surprised look and asked if we had reservations. We did not. After looking around for an empty table (there was only one other couple having dinner), she seated us. We noticed that she gave other people who walked in after us the same \"welcoming\" treatment. We ordered our food but they forgot to bring us the appetizer. I mentioned to the waiter that we had ordered an appetizer after he brought us the main course  and he looked very confused. We were later informed by the hostess that they were out of that particular appetizer. The food was mediocre. It did not have the flavor of good Indian food. Despite everything I mentioned above, I would've given it three stars until I went to the bathroom. There was a distinctive smell of urine around the entire lower level, which is where the bathrooms are located. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.",

We'd probably leave more of a tip if it wasn't cheekily added already tbh. It's still more than worth the amazing grub",

    "text": "I have been coming here for years, I lived across the road in my student days so the lunch time buffet was always a go to for vast amounts of healthy food. Sadly I am never in town these days at lunch, but I have been in for their evening service many times in the last few years so my review is more focused on that aspect.  Birthday meal for the missus last night who had not been here before and is vegan, so a dedicated veg/vegan curry place was ideal. First impressions were I liked the new decor. Service was efficient and attentive.    Now the food. I always opt for the Thali (All three courses served at once on a tray containing little dishes) in here on the a la carte, alas my favourite the southern Indian Thali hasn't been on the menu for a while.  I opted for the Royal Thali and the missus the vegan thali with popadoms to start. The poppadoms turned up with pickles and a \"with compliments\" ... grand. Everything was great they even presented us with a new pickle we hadn't tried before, which was sag and chilli pickle.   The mains arrived promptly and what a feast to be presented with lots of curry options, great nan and amazing parkoras. We were too full for the deserts but tried a little of the vegan desert and the rice pud, which were very nice. The food was excellent and filling, just what we needed. One of the best Dal's I have tried. The missus loved her offerings too. The food was 5 stars for me.  The only downsides was when I paid up and left without checking the bill. It sounded roughly right but i was in a hurry.  We were charged extra for the pickles that were presented \"with compliments\" that we didn't order,  the service charge was on there and the beers were not terrible just not good. The taps really need run through a bit.  All in well worth a visit for the food. I will be back for the buffet one lunch time, but the extra costs lost a point for what would have been a 5 star review.",

One of my friends decided about a year ago that animals were getting more than they deserved off humans and so he went veggie.  We went out for dinner with him to Kalpna and, on the whole, it was pretty good.   I definitely like my meat, but vegetarian cooking is as good as any other and Indian varieties are no exception.  I went for the vegetable Balti which didn't take too long to arrive and was delicious when it did.  They'd included a great combination of peppers, onions and root vegetables in a tasty, spicy sauce.  They must have had some problem with one of my mate's mains, however, as she was waiting for about ten minutes after we all received ours.  I'd come here again, but I'd expect better service to go with their great food.",
