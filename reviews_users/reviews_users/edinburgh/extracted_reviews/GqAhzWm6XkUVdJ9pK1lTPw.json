    "text": "I have been a customer of Cafe Truva on the Shore for a few years now. It is a firm weekend breakfast favourite, especially on those weary mornings following a late night...   Cafe Truva has a menu of various breakfast choices, salads, paninis, sandwiches, kebabs, falafel etc. There is something for everyone, I think.  I am most familiar with the ham & cheese croissant which comes with a side salad, little bit of cous cous and hot peppers. I have also tried the delicious turkish breakfast: cheeses, meats, cucumber, tomato, egg and toast. After you have had this and a cup of coffee, you feel you can conquer almost anything :)  Last week I sampled the lentil soup and it came with a toasted large roll. Takeaway price for this lunchtime favourite was only  1.60 which is very reasonable.   The cafe is fairly small but cosy. There are a few outside spaces as well and on sunny days they get quickly snapped up by locals.  I recommend this place - a little bit of Turkey on the Shore :)",

    "text": "Cafe Truva on the Shore. This is one of the places that only get better and better! It has been there for years (in effect since 1998!) It went from small Turkish offerings to the full well placed Eastern Med  restaurant chain (3 restaurant and counting)   I like this original shop. Cosy, clean and very friendly. They are frequented by locals as well as day trippers to the shore. It is well placed on the edge of the Shore over looking the water and it is a sun trap! Winter or Summer - if the sun is out - Truva will be in it. - The food is definatly Turkish with added burgers and panini's - the whole day breakfast (Turkish or Scottish) is a treat and a feast. Not too expensive.   They offer free WiFi, take-away and also do outside Catering",

    "text": "I'd walked past the other branch of this turkish cafe, which is at the Royal Mile, and was surprised to see it again on a day trip to Leith!  In Edinburgh, one's got the option to eat foods from so many different cuisines of the world, but I was still very excited to try the food here, as it's the only turkish restaurant I've come across so far. If you're not that much of an adventurous eater, there's the traditional fry-up breakfast as well as sandwiches, but the really exciting stuff is the array of mediterranean food they serve!  It's possible to have stuffed vine leaves, moussaka, and mezze platters, and there're some delicious desserts such as baklava available.   The cafe's location at the shore means that you'll get some nice sea breeze and a great view to go with your food. It's good to keep in mind that they are a little bit pricier than a couple of other cafe's though!",

    "text": "If someone pushed me to choose my favourite cuisine, I might well pick Mediterranean, or, more specifically, Turkish food.  When I visited Istanbul as a child, I fell in love with the subtle flavourings, the hot and cold salads, the meltingly stewed vegetables and the honey-drenched sweets.  So, discovering Cafe Truva on the Shore was a real treat for me.  It's a fairly casual little establishment, where you can drop in for lunch or coffee, or else pick out some items to take away.  They offer competent versions of favourite dishes, such as stuffed vine leaves, green bean salad, and, of course, gloriously sticky baklava, which are all tasty, if not as absolutely stunning as this kind of food has the potential to be.    I haven't had a chance to try any of their sandwiches, but I was pleased to see that they have a good selection of vegetarian options - too many Turkish places offer kebab, kebab, or kebab.  Overall, this brightly-painted cafe is an inviting place to stop by for a light meal, and, while the Waters of Leith don't quite measure up to the Bosphorus, with a little imagination you might be able to conjure up an image of Turkey here.",

Big portions, delicious pita (OK so not really supposed to eat pita bread at the moment but the temptation was too much) and generous nice salads. The chicken panini was bit tough for the boy's liking. Stuffed vine leaves were nice, the green olives that came with the salad were drop dead delicious with this buttery overtone that I didn't expect. Artichoke salad wasn't drained properly (artichokes from a can) so there was a lot of water combined with dressing that sadly soggi-fied my pita. Definitely nice, and a generous menu fit for most dietary needs. Baklava and assorted sweets looked appetizing. It's not a must visit, but it's definitely a good place to go if you need a lunch spot in Leith.",

The portions are pretty good for the money you spend, which isn't outrageous, and its damned tasty!

I'd frequently pop in here for my lunch to take back to the office and leave with a big cup of hearty delicious soup, and the most gigantic baked potato imaginable.   And the fillings for the baked potato were deliciousheaps upon heaps of roasted vegetables, spoonfuls of sloppy hummus, aubergines, and plenty of choice for the meat eaters too. Every time I walked back into the office I'd have people salivating at what I was eating (although thankfully not all over me!).   For the amount that I'd end up with (and believe me, I was stuffed every time I finished eating), the prices were incredibly reasonable. I'd have paid that much for a small sandwich and a small soup elsewhere, and have nothing anywhere near as tasty.   The staff are friendly warm and accommodating. A lovely cafe in an ideal location on The Shore.",

The range of choice, whether sitting in or taking out, is absolutely staggering and it's a lot more than just soup and sandwiches. I've mainly been in here for lunch but the breakfast menu looks very attractive too. I recommend taking some time to sit down and sample the delicious mezze plates. Or on a cold day, the moussaka will really warm you up. For vegetarians this might just be the best place on The Shore; with all the roasted vegetables and couscous on offer, even the carnivores like me are likely to go for veggie options.",
