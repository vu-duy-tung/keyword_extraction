We had the chicken. I had chicken gyro type thing. It wasn't that great. The chicken was cut into small bits and mixed with some kind of sauce. It was all wrapped in a pita with lettuce & tomatoes. But my eating partner had the grilled chicken thighs. Amazing! The sauce was so good and they were grilled really well. Super tasty.   We also had a starter. A trio of dips. Hummus, babaganoush and tzaziki. None were really that stand out. Pretty bog standard. I would order again but don't expect amazingness. However, we really liked the bread the dips were served with. It was thicker than pita but not crusty bread. It was quite special.",

On a cold and breezy day, Laila's was warm and welcoming.   I had Laila's half chicken, and it was two pieces of white and dark meat heaven, both seasoned and marinated to perfection. I chose a fragrant basmati rice as my side; the small salad that it comes with is also very good.   Price wise they are up there compared to the area but definitely worth it. Do be advised that they add a 1 \"charity\" charge to your bill. I caught it and asked about it, and was advised that it's optional but I wonder what would have happened if I hadn't noticed it. I left the charge on as it's ultimately not a big deal.   It's too bad that I didn't have room for some of their tiramisu, it looked great!",

The duck salami was very tasty, Haloumi cheese and cranberry sauce was amazingly crispy, and the hummus was on point.

    "text": "What a delightful little place!  I took my American parents to a wide variety of restaurants while they were in Edinburgh, as they live in a small town without access to much foodie diversity. As they'd never had Mediterranean before and it's one of my absolute favorites, I was on the lookout for a place that fit the bill--Laila's, happily, was just that!  Laila's is set just off the Royal Mile down Cockburn Street, which is a charming side-street in the heart of Edinburgh. It fits the cuteness of the street well, as the inside of Laila's has amazing atmosphere. The lighting on the walls are particularly snazzy in my opinion! It's cozy but large enough that you feel quite private within, which is lovely in comparison to joints that squeeze in as many tables as possible in their space allotment.  We were warmly welcomed by the staff there, and in no short order we had our drinks (non alcoholic, this place is BYOB though!) and a platter of dips--baba ganoush, tzitziki, and hummus of course, with a lovely basket of bread for dipping. I'll admit the hummus and baba ganoush were pretty standard fare, but the tzatziki was nom-tastic!  Now on to the mains! This is where Laila's really impressed me. My dad had a lamb pasta, my mom had grilled chicken with pomegranate rice, and I myself stuck with a trusty falafel wrap. Four stars all around for solid mains, although I could've gone for a bit more of that trusty falafel fatty, cumin-soaked flavor--have I been corrupted by all the kebab shops in town, perhaps? But the five stars of the evening definitely went to the grilled chicken and pomegranate rice. I'm normally not a huge fan of pomegranates, but that rice was INCREDIBLE. I spent most of the evening trying to sneak as much of it as I could off my mum's plate!  All in all, I think Laila's is a lovely joint with atmosphere, charm, and lovely meals that'll leave you feeling satisfied and certainly far healthier than eating say, yet another fish & chips meal at the local pub!",

It looks less \"hipster\" or \"pub\" from the outside than other restaurants in this very touristy area, but that's actually it's charm.  You walk in and the tables are set up in a way where it feels intimate and you can have a good view of the street and do some people watching.  The Mediterranean style food was perfectly done and full of flavor.  I had the lamb sausage casserole and my boyfriend had the 1/2 chicken special.  Both delicious...and (another surprise) the rice they came with was incredible and also prepared with spices, herbs and peppers that I didn't expect.  At first we were a little disappointed they don't serve beer or wine here, but really....there are plenty of bars to hit up after...and the food is really worth it.",

I went for a meze selection- feta salad (this was my favourite), halloumi with cranberry sauce, a potato salad & baba ghanoush with Iranian bread. All was delish. I also tried the grilled chicken skewer- really nice tender chicken with gentle spicing. You only get one skewer but it's enough, there's about 2 chicken breasts on the whole skewer. Didn't really like the Ariani drink (personal taste) - it's a yoghurt drink with salt.   I'd go back just for that feta salad.. Yum. We also took away the baclava and a saffron & cardamom sorbet. Baclava is really nice, quite sticky but I prefer that. Oh and it's BYOB no corkage.",

And I will admit it, the free wifi got me through the door, bc free wifi is like gold when I am traveling internationally.    Got seated promptly, and the waitress let me know the kitchen was close to closing, so my options were limited.  She said falafel, I said OK (I love falafel).  I was expecting the usual wrap, some cucumbers and tomatoes, tahini, etc.  This was SO MUCH better.  Easily the best falafel sandwich I have had.  The falafel itself was good, and plentiful, but what made it special was they had wrapped it and then essentially panini pressed it, and the cucumbers and tomato seemed to be dressed or lightly pickled.  It was just delicious, and I wish I had found it sooner so I could have gone there again.  The service was great - waitress was very sweet, checked on me but wasn't annoying, etc.",

The meat was tender and moist and had a rich flavor. The place is cozy and sitting outside people watching was fun. Service may have been a little slow but in their defense it was a Saturday night during the Fringe. Staff were very friendly. Definitely will come back next time in town.",
