They had run out of cream cheese and they actually went to the store to get some so we could have it for our bagels! I would highly recommend this for a quick easy breakfast! Thank you for the kind service while we are visiting Edinburgh!",

Great fried breakfasts, morning rolls, burgers, daily specials. Now serving espresso based coffee.  I like the people who run the cafe - friendly, attentive, eager to please.",

After a particularly late night and a few hours kip on a friends floor, we headed to this place for the best breakfast ever. My flatmate swears by their bacon rolls. It was a fried egg sandwich for me with a big mug of tea and I was right as rain...almost.",
