    "text": "Lovely spot! Came here for a friend's birthday and it was just the thing.   It was pretty quiet on a Monday night, but we didn't mind since that meant we got plenty of attend from the very friendly and funny owner!   We got the veggie paella, they ask you how many \"portions\" you want, but it will come in the traditional very wide paella pan! We had three portions, which was more than enough for the 5 of us with some tapas for appetizers. Check out my picture of the paella for reference.   For tapas, we tried patatas bravas (potatos), champinones rellenos (cheese stuffed mushrooms), and some tasty shrimp.   I can't say the patatas bravas were much to write home about, but the other tapas and certainly the paella and sangria made it worth it.  We had a lovely time, got to meet the owner and chef, and celebrated my friend's birthday in fine style. It wasn't too overpriced, but was definitely a bit more expensive than a casual night out.   I will likely be back!",

Their food seems frozen-- the paella was completely watery and fishy, I could make it better myself. I don't feel safe eating the food at all.",

    "text": "Nice little Spanish restaurant, quite hidden away just off Nicolson Street. Mary's parents and sisters visited Edinburgh for a weekend, and wanted to take us out for a nice dinner. Coming across La Sal purely by chance, a reservation was made. It was a good choice. We decided to have a selection of tapas for the table, washed down with the house white wine. I tried a selection of chicken, pork, and vegetarian options, plenty of tortilla type dishes among them. I'm no expert on Spanish food, but I'm definitely a fan! The staff are very friendly indeed. I really adore Spanish accents, and all the staff here seem to have them! They were helpful and offered suggestions as to what we should try. Mary's mother left behind her scarf accidentally, but there was no problem retrieving it the next day. La Sal is worth a try.",

They offer live flamenco shows on weekends with amazing dance and there is also a flamenco school next door for those who wish to learn flamenco dance, singing, clapping, percussion and guitar!  The lunch deal is great- 3 course for 7.50 or Main w coffee/ tea 5.50 and it is \"excuse my language\" delicious!! Ole!!!",

    "text": "This Tapas restaurant is a lively, cosy place tucked on the corner of a cobbled side alley close to the Pleasance. I have never been to Spain and have not tried tapas before, so I'm far from an expert, though I believe  that tapas traditionally is a small bar snack to accompany drinks in a pub. That being said the tapas here is expanded to make it large enough for a main meal (when two or three of the tapas are combined).  We had patatas bravas (cubed chips essentially), chorizo in red wine sauce, battered mushrooms and cheese, grilled peppers, butter beans and black pudding, black pudding and relish,(all of these had Spanish names obviously but I can't remember them!) battered cubes of fish, iberico ham, and prawns in garlic and olive oil and to finish churros and coffee. Firstly the iberico ham was the standout for me by a mile, (it's cut from a big leg that stands triumphantly  near the entrance.) it was sweet, savoury and full of rich creamy fat. The prawns and the fish were cooked to perfection, however the majority of the other dishes were underseasoned. The peppers should have been encrusted liberally with salt apparently but didn't seem to have any seasoning at all so tasted bland.  The patatas bravas weren't crispy like good chips but limp and soggy. Don't want to go on and moan a lot but the main issue was simply lack of flavour. Which is a shame because service was friendly and they put up with our rather boistrous birthday celebrations with good humour and brought out some ice cream with sparklers and played 'Happy Birthday' but I feel the ruthless sword of truth must be wielded!  The churros were again a bit lacking on sugar and pale and anaemic looking  and the chocolate sauce could have been thicker. It wasn't a terrible meal by any stretch of the imagination, all perfectly edible but needed more flavour. One final issue was that the meal had to be conducted in two 'shifts' as it were because the table was too small to contain all the tapas we'd ordered.",

    "text": "As we were looking for a tapas restaurant that wasn't too expensive, and still had a table for two on a Saturday night, we stumbled upon La Sal. I'd not heard of this restaurant before, as it's a bit further from where I usually venture for restaurants. I was a bit early for my reservation but this was no problem and I was seated by the friendly owner. The tables felt a bit close together, but other than that it was great. I mulled over the winelist and was happy to see they offered wine by 500ml as well, since a bottle is usually too much for the two of us.  My boyfriend arrived and we decided on 5 different tapas and the house wine. The tapas arrived quickly, first the bread, when we finished that the two fried dishes, and after we devoured that the two meat dishes. Perfect! I found the food a little bit bland, but that might be personal because my boyfriend didn't find that at all.  We finished off with Spanish desserts, and a liquor (unfortunately they didn't offer dessert wine). The service was good, very friendly and (mostly) timely as well.. After we finished our desserts we weren't asked if we wanted coffee or the bill, so we went to the front to pay up. It had a nice atmosphere but I definitely had better tapas before. I might be back to try out different dishes, but I would probably go to a different restaurant if it was my choice!",
