    "text": "Edinburgh's most sophisticated wine bar, in the heart of the city's West End. This place used to be an old Polish church originally named the Oratory of St Anne. They do have several convivial seating areas, a few intimate corners and an awesome mezzanine floor in this very classy upscale venue.  Le Di-Vin offers a selection of food, including platters of cheese, charcuterie, smoked fish, terrines, and salads. The wine bar also plays host to various wine tasting events held throughout the year.  They have a huge selection of diverse wines to please everyone around.  The place is very intemate",

Really beautiful place with a huge bar filled with lots of wines and beers. The cheese and charcuterie plate we had was pretty impressive! It was a bounty of great local Scottish cheeses and then meats from around the world that paired so nicely together. My personal fav was the rabbit pate. Wow that was tasty. If we had more time I'm sure we would have stopped back here for another sip of wine a full meal. Based on what we saw, this place really seemed fantastic.",

Sometimes I feel a little let down by the voucher experience in that the portions, finish, service etc don't match the regular experience of a place. No such negatives here. Everything is always top notch.   Now lets start at the type of bar itself. I am normally the last person you would find in a wine bar (think dive, metal, old mans bars as my usual watering holes), but the draw of sharing boards and a bottle of wine all in twisted my arm. The building its self really stands out in what is already a very interesting looking area. The main bar area is large room with high ceilings on 2 levels with nice mezzanine area to the rear. A great mix off traditional and contemporary greats you on entrance.   The staff are quick to help on arrival, but not in a pushy or awkward way. Through out our meal the waiter was attentive, polite and very knowledgeable on the interesting cheeses presented to us. The wine was nice and the cheese sharing board excellent. We also ordered some extras and these were excellent too, in particular the Serrano ham.  That is 2 nights here and each time it has been excellent for a celebration or date with the missus. I would recommend this place to any one, but it is a little pricy so definitely one for a celebration or on the right side of pay day.  Plus sides: - extensive wines  - amazing food - amazing food that comes on a board - great staff - nice setting  Minus sides - ....... I don't have any I really am stuck.  NOTE: Access is quite good if you have people who have certain types of access requirements. There are a few steps up to the entrance, but once inside the bathrooms are all ground level.",

Great selection of wines, cozy but modern atmosphere and some comfy chairs make Le Di Vin one of my preferred places to have a drink and a chat. Good music in the background to complement your evening. It's very nice here indeed.  The clientele tends to be older, with plenty cash in their pockets, good hair and tailored jackets. So it's probably not everyone's cup of tea, but for relaxed atmosphere and some good glasses of wine, I'm happy to chill in the company of some Range Rover owners.",

    "text": "We attended this place for a work colleagues leaving do, and although a wine bar isn't my usual joint I quite enjoyed a glass of red here. It was overpriced for what you got, but it's meant to feel exclusive I guess.  Unfortunately on the night an elderly gentlemen on his retirement starting making trouble in the neighbourhood, he got in one little fight and the rest of my party got scared,  so we moved on to a pub on the corner of bell air.  Unfortunately the owner refused to eject the trouble maker as he was a regular big spender which leads me to my next point.  The clientele is basically over 50s, old Edinburgh money, as there's a fair share of sports cars and range rovers parked outside. Not the place to go if you've come out for a night of chat and banter with randoms.  I might not be old Edinburgh money, but I can certainly choose where to spend mine and I don't think this place would see any of my hard earned pennies again.",

This restaurant is worth the effort to find it & one of those rare discoveries when it helps to have someone point you in that direction. Food was great, ambiance  was great, can't say enough!  If you are in Edinburgh, go find this restaurant if only to enjoy a glass of wine - not a tourist destination!.",

    "text": "Hmm, is it normal for a place to bring your bill after you order drinks?? When you're sitting at a table? This really annoyed me. Do I really look like the type to do a runner?!?  Don't answer that.....:)  Went here for a few Vinos with my brother and his friend. The ambience isn't particularly great but it was early. Having been here before I know it's a nice place for a glass of wine especially at night when they darken the lights a bit. Unfortunately we were full after our afternoon tea. I say unfortunately as the cheese and charcuterie boards looked great. I always forget about this place for food. For me it's more of a watering establishment but then I see the menu and think \"I always forget about this place...\" And so it keeps happening... It's ideal if you're meeting someone for a \"catch up and nibbles\" or pre/post lunch or dinner.",

    "text": "Hidden wine bar just off Charlotte square with a lovely selection of wine  I really like this place, it is hidden behind Le Petite Folie in a beautiful building with a glass roof . The selection of wine is great and the staff are very friendly. The wines are in a huge display over the bar and there is also a little balcony area that you can reserve.  It seems very popular as an after work drinking place as it is full of businessy types from about 4pm. The food is distinctly average but not bad for the price.  Some reviews say its overpriced but I can't agree - the shared platters of charcuterie and cheese are pretty good, very filling and only marginally dearer that a chain pizza from round the corner. The homemade soup delicious too. I say give it a try!",

I spent New Years Eve with a very special person and we drank lot's of good Merlot (we even got a free glass at one point since it was new years) they played loads of classic Motown stuff and had a cheeky shot on the dance floor too. Then we went to Princes St to watch the fireworks from the castle and then were allowed back in no problem to spend a couple more hours! Perfect evening.",

    "text": "Le Di-Vin has recently appeared beside its French counterpart, La P'tite Folie, a restaurant that has long been an established and frequented culinary establishment at the west end.   Le Di-Vin is all about wine exploration, so if you're the kind of person that likes to try two or three different wines of an evening, or possibly more, then this would be a good place to start. You can get pretty much every wine sold here by the glass, bonus, because it can be really annoying if you venture somewhere and there are about two wines sold by the glass, none of which you're keen on. There are times when ordering a bottle of white wine to yourself is not a good idea...actually, you should probably never do that, because it's probably classed as a cheeky bit of binge drinking. With more than 60 wines to choose from, this is an extensive and really well varied menu.  You could also add to the Frenchness by ordering a cheese board or some charcuterie items, and the bar serves other light bites.  Le Di-Vin has gone for a traditional, fairly relaxed look, so it's not one of those wine bars that's overly polished and too stylised for you to feel comfortable and enjoy yourself. The bar area looks great, with the wine bottles stacked to the rafters, and there's a fair bit of table space, plus a small mezzanine floor.",

    "text": "This hidden away bar sits next to Le petit Folie in the West End (just opposite Sygn bar).  It's got a great atmosphere. Comfortable seating. A lovely long bar area to sit at and an upstairs area. It has a huge montage painting of various French and Scottish famous people (try and guess them all - some of them are very difficult to work out!)  It mainly does small light bites and sharers for food. It has a great and varied selection of wines to try out by the bottle and glass.   There is certainly an 'over 50's type' that frequent this bar but that is not to say not go if you are younger. I think it's a lovely place for a quiet drink during the week and to catch up with a friend, or for a date.  It can get busy with financial types after work, especially Wednesday/Thursday/Fridays.  The croque monsieur is delicious, as are the various charcuterie and antipasti dishes. The food is quite pricey but definitely high quality.  Will certainly keep going there!",

The surroundings are gorgeous, the bar is in a converted Polish church next to La P'tite Folie and looks spectacular with a high ceiling and cosy little mezzanine which can be hired for parties. The wine list is huge as you would expect and although there is a French theme it includes wine from around the world. I also appreciated that there is a wide range of prices (from c.20 a bottle upwards). The food menu is very limited but tasty - they only offer various sandwiches and charcuterie/cheese boards which are great for sharing with friends. All the staff seem to be very friendly and knowledgeable about all the wine, meat and cheese they sell. This is a great bar with a good atmosphere - perfect for catching up with friends.",
