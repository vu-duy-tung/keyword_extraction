    "text": "TGI Friday's is located in Castle Street in Edinburgh, which is just off Princes Street's western side.   There is a waiting area beside the door which you may well need to use as it can get very busy at peak times and you may have to wait for a table.   TGI Friday's is an American themed restaurant so expect well trained barmen shaking cocktails and friendly, hands-on service.   I last visited with my daughter and she ordered from the childrens' menu, having a 3oz fillet steak with chips and peas for 4.99 while I opted for a burger, having a cheese and bacon burger which was delicious.   TGI Friday's menu is predominantly meat and burgers with some pasta dishes. They use a Jack Daniels sauce and marinade on many dishes - this however is not to my taste. I was disappointed to see no fillet steak on the main menu too.   You can get some incredible cocktails at TGI Fridays and I can attest to the quality having had a Long Island Iced Tea on a previous visit which was fantastic.   Pricewise this place isn't too bad - my burger came in at 9.99 and the entire meal for myself and my daughter including soft drinks was less than 20, which considering the quality of the food was excellent value for money in my opinion.",

Milkshakes were a bit stingy though, they appear to have stopped filling them to the top of the glass now, which sucks.

The food isn't amazing, but if you're going specifically to TGI's it's probably just what you're in the mood for- meat covered in BBQ or JD sauce! But, aye, the cocktails! Everyone must have a Gremlin before they die. We tend to sit at the bar after our meal for a couple of drinks, and the barsmen are always chatty and helpful. I have had my own cocktail made on more than one occasion. The barman asked me 3 things I like in a cocktail, and he made it up to my spec right in front of me! OH, and my boyfriend accidently ordered just a banana milkshake, and it was the most amazing ever created. Please get one!",

They have affordable prices, amazing cocktails which are made in front of you if you are the bar. I would suggest the Raspberry Watkins or the woo woo. They are delish. they also have non-alcoholic ones which are just as good..And once you get to the meal, oh my..there have an amazing Jack Daniels sauce which i felt like taking home with me.i even asked for more, but anyway if you start with the Mac and cheese bites which are divine.Then the Rib's which are a huge portion but i challenge anyone to be able to not finish them.OR the Jack Daniels chicken which has a cheesy delicious mash and fresh vegetables.After all this you still have desert but i didn't have enough room but i had enjoyed the first 2 courses that i simply had to get something else before i left..IF you go for a birthday let the staff know as they have a special bday jingle they sing..they're also very friendly and definetly always deserve a tip!!!",

I would recommend the burgers and the milkshakes (keep in mind a milkshake with an ice cream sundae from here is a sickly combination, although separately fine). An interesting place to eat, particularly if your company is boring as there is plenty to look at. They are happy to sing happy birthday (there are even two different versions, one for kids and one for adults - the latter involving the words 'someone here is getting old') but you should be prepared for some embarassment as they tend to make you stand on the spiral staircase in the middle of the restaurant as they announce your birthday to the room and sing to you. A nice place to eat whether it's a casual lunch or a celebratory meal.",

The good news is, TGIF beats Hard Rock in all aspects.  The atmosphere is generally relaxed and seats all spaced out.  I feel that in Hard Rock cafe, it can get a little bit too crowded at times although everyone is sitting down.  There are also partitions between sets of tables and high walls which separates every group.  It feels more personal and more intimate.  Area wise, there are bigger seating space and there is a bigger bar area which is perfect.  Hard Rock Cafe bar area is just too small for those waiting for their tables.  For food wise, I think there are generally not much difference, both serve about the same type of food but i think TGIF do have better and more tender meat than Hard Rock.  That said, it's good but not the best.",

However, there seems to be some kind of East/West discrepancy. TGI Fridays in Glasgow would get bstars, or maybe even flour, but TGIs in Edinburgh is lucky to be getting two stars.  The staff were great, but I had mixed up the booking and had booked the table for a day later than required, but they sorted us out. It took us ages to pick from the menu, I ordered buffalo wings. I love buffalo wings. I do. They're my favourite ever thing from TGIs but in Edinburgh...THEY DON'T PUT SAUCE ON THEM. I was traumatised. I was unsatisfied.   I ordered a chicken burger next and found it unbearably salty. I don't usually have TGIs burgers, and I don't think I will again if they're this salty.   My boyfriend shared his Oreo sundae with me and that was really good, so that's why I'm giving this place two stars.",

    "text": "American Grill  Oh yes there was a time it was 'hip' and 'cool' to eat at TGI Friday.  That was about the time that those words were frequently used to mean exactly that. The concept has not changed, consumerism happened. There are places that do steak to perfection. Burger Bars that serve culinary masterpieces and for chicken wings there is only ONE place - and this ain't it.  Sure, burgers, fritters, wings and a steak, finished off with a Sundae - who can say no to that.  Well not many people, but guess what, some places to it better, tastier and .. *gasp* .. classier.  I appreciate the atmosphere they try to convey, and the service is great, cheerful and attentive (part of their briefing I know, but feels genuine)  nothing wrong there. I like the location and certainly the money off special deals they have at times.   What I don't like is the flavour, it is lacking that umph. There is no real heat in hot sauce, no satisfaction in the peppered steak.. oh, and the cola float .. well you get the idea that these are not the droids you're looking for.   It is catered to kids, not to the older ones, but the tiny tots that just outgrew the buggy are in the \"I can do this myself, mummy\" stage. The drinks are geared to this demographic : sweet and colourful.  The portion sizes are of a similar ilk. I am not a big eater, but my eyes do like to feast on size of portion. My experiences are a mixed bag and all on the small side. No lack of colourful produce, but small sizes and free of any flavours that may offend parents, toddlers and alike.   I just hope that some day it would be cool AND pleasant to eat here, because at the moment I avoid the place as much as I can.",

I also love cosy little restaurants, but on the other hand, there are few meals in the world more satisfying than a half rack of ribs along with some blackened Cajun chicken and a side of onion rings.   This branch provides the same fattening, delicious feasts as all the rest, and like the others, has undergone a minor facelift of late in order to bring it into the 21st century. The staff have toned down the over-friendliness that failed to disguise their obvious self-loathing and feelings of worthlessness, the decor has been made marginally less brash, and the menu returned to glories past.   So stop pretending you're too cool or alternative to like it, and embrace TGI's for the genius that it is.",

    "text": "Ugh... I hate this place. Seriously hate it. I went in for a friends birthday, her choice clearly...as soon as I saw the menu I was filled with disappointment. Nothing on here isn't fried, like nothing. I'm surprised even the menu wasn't presented to you fried. Honestly the food is SO cheap & nasty I could go to lidl & pick up something better. Its REDICULOUS prices too, for what you get.... there are so many lovely restaurants (even the snobby upper class ones) that charge less than this... 13 for a crappy burger... seriously?! My food came out swimming in oil it was jut so greasy I wanted to go home & have a shower afterwards.  The only saving grace as the staff, which I cannot fault at all, service was spot on, friendly & attentive... i'm sorry to give you guys a low score as you were all working so hard & I know its a chain so staff have no control over the menu, but the food is just horrible & I would not recommend this if it was the last place to eat on earth.",

    "text": "Poor old TGI's it's not doing too well on Yelp so I though I should put in my tuppence worth about my dining experiences here which have all, bar one been nothing other than fantastic. The one occasion where it could have been a bit better I was with a large group and one of my friends orders was completely forgotten about, so she had to watch, drooling while the rest of us scoffed down out meal - oops. The mistake was rectified as soon as we pointed out to one of the waitresses.  You know what to expect from TGI's; burgers, nachos, ribs, chicken wings and their chips which are especially delicious even though the portions could do with being a little bit more generous.   It is quite pricey but great if you're looking for American food and especially great for families/birthday parties or if you're with a big group as it always has a great atmosphere. I like TGI's now and again for a wee treat, especially when I can't be bothered with getting all dolled up to go to a nice restaurant. Good old TGI's.",

    "text": "I hear staff in TGI Fridays do a lot of training before they get to be a fully fledged waiter. I don't know whether this is True or not, but if it is it is time to rethink their training programme. No matter what TGI's I go to the service is always crap. Especially in this one.   Hi miss waitress person I have been waiting to place my order for twenty minutes. Stop walking past me and lowering your eyes so I can't attract your attention. Oh Mr waiter guy, your service was completely awful that is why we didn't leave you a tip. You proved I made the right decision when you angrily asked where your tip was.   I do quite enjoy TGI's food though. I know I shouldn't because we all like to turn our noses up at them and it's the same in every restaurant, but it is my kind of food and it goes down a treat. That's why it gets an extra star.   One more thing, I only like the food when it is on the lunch deal so it is cheap. If I paid full price for it I would rethink my decision to like it.",

    "text": "Big enough to accommodate a dozen of us on short notice (i.e we phoned as we were walking down the road!) with excellent service. The staff are always excitable and chatty, hoping diners have as much of a good time as a good meal.   The food itself is fantastic for what you're expecting, although you do pay for it. A brilliant hungover dinner, especially with the free refills and wonderfully greasy menu and super sweet desserts.   Not to be done too often, especially for a 'nice meal out' but certainly a restaurant that can be relied upon regardless of the day of the week or time of dining.   one waiter 'refused' to bring out one of our party's blue steak, which he was quite apologetic about, but he could have arranged this with another member of staff and not made a song and dance about it in front of our table.",

    "text": "To be honest I have never really liked this TGI's - I have tried it a couple of times but much prefer the one in Glasgow. The staff are nice and try their best but a few times I have been they have had things on the menu that they haven't been able to produce and I have ended up being recommended something else which is not so nice at all. I know the staff are probably told - 'if they order this then push this instead' but if it isn't as good why bother? And it is quite expensive for what it is. I can get a decent burger somewhere else for the same price rather than a substandard one from TGI's.  It just seems good these days for parties and events.",

    "text": "I have to update my review here, because although I believe we visited TGI's Edinburgh on a bad day, I went again a few days ago for a quick lunch and I had a gorgeous burger which was served with a smile. Stacked with cheese, mozzarella dippers and crispy bacon, it was so yummy! The waitress was so nice to us (perhaps she's had a read of the reviews on here) and we left thoroughly satisfied. So I'll up my review by a star because really, sometimes, TGI Fridays is just the perfect comfort food.",
