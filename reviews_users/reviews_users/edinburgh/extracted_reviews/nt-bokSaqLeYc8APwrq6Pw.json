    "text": "We took forever to decide that we were going out for a meal.  When we did we chose Kwelin because of the reviews and location from home.  The fact that we could get a table at 2130 also helped the process.  Kwelin's food was good, I wouldn't say the best I have had but we both thoroughly enjoyed it.  The staff were friendly and even though we were blatantly stopping them going home they never made us feel like we had to leave.  I found it good value and would definitely go again.",

    "text": "First visit to Kweilin and it was enjoyable.  I'm not sure I was totally blown away as I know other people are. Having eaten in China Town in San Fran and having my pick of about everything on the menu as they didn't use wheat flour, (I'm GF) then there were lots which were wheat based that I had to miss out on.  I could have the crispy duck (yum) but minus the pancakes as they use the mixed wheat/rice flour one's, rather than just rice paper rolls. The chicken and sweetcorn soup was delicious as was my chicken and cashew nuts (with boiled rice). I made the mistake of not checking about dessert - it was advertised as apple in caramel and I thought yum! Until it came as deep fried balls of apple, covered in wheat batter and covered again in caramel. It was delish looking but totally off limits so the rest of the table tucked in.   So, there are good options, food is reasonably priced (on a par with other restaurants of this quality) and the set menu's are good value - we had the 'crispy duck' which was soup and prawn crackers, crispy duck, choice of mains and tea or coffee at the end (25 pp).  The wine list was ok too - started off with a malbec and then moved to pinot grigio with mains and both went well with all our dishes. So I wouldn't not come on the basis of the overall wheat base of the food but I would be aware that my options will be a tad more restricted than other places I've experienced before...",

    "text": "We went to Kweilin on the recommendation of an article in the Guardian. The space is fairly traditional for a Chinese restaurant and not much to write about.   The food - in particular the seafood - was fresh and nicely prepared. The service was friendly and quick. The paper prawns were very tasty and meaty. Both the hot & sour and the crab & corn soups were delicious. The mains of Cantonese chow mein, the Eight Treasure duck and steamed sea bass were what you would expect from a good Chinese spot.   All this being said, 100 for 3 people is just insane for Chinese with no drinks. I liked the food but the value for money is just crazy. I've had equally good - if not better - Chinese food elsewhere for half the price. Not sure when I'll be in Edinburgh again and I doubt I would go back.",

I've only eaten in once and although as Cheryl said it's nothing edgey or high fashion, the service was brilliant and the food was, as always, FANTASTIC! I've lost count of how many times I've gotten takeout from here but it's been on point every.single.time. I've had a variety of dishes from fish & tofu in a claypot to the more mainstream sweet & sour chicken/pork and have not found fault with any of the dishes.  Well worth a visit.",

    "text": "The Kweilin is one of the classic old gentleman of the Cantonese restaurant scene in Edinburgh, having been around for years to bring its traditional service, and menu offerings, to steadfastly loyal Edinburgh diners.  Ok, so it isn't the edgiest, most high fashion establishment to elegantly eat your noodles (who I am kidding, there's nothing elegant about my chopstick technique), but what it doesn't have necessarily in the trends department, it makes up for with a consistently high standard of food and very professional staff.  The dishes here follow a very classic Cantonese menu route, so all your old, comforting favourites are here, from lemon chicken, to the everlastingly good Chow Mein, and a good old helping of crispy Peking duck and pancakes. I always eat too much when I come here, and somehow, after eating the equivalent of about six main courses, I still manage to consume a wholeheartedly calorific banana fritter at the end of it all. Tremendous.",

The service is extremely friendly, the Cantonese food is delicious and it's well-placed in the heart of the Edinburgh New Town.   However, don't expect fancy decor and gimmicks - The Kweilin is all about exceptional dishes such as their shredded chili beef, lemon chicken and gorgeous aromatic crispy duck.   I've spent many a birthday at the Kweilin and will no doubt be back there in the very near future!",

The staff are still excellent but I don't think I will be going back for a while. As regards parking in the New Town, it is getting harder to find parking spaces and the locals, who pay for parking permits, can get a bit tetchy if you park in a permit holder's only space; although this is permitted between 5.30 p.m and 8.30 a.m. so try to keep off the permit holder's only spaces.",
