The eggs were cooked perfectly, the sausage was delicious (and I'm not usually a sausage person), and the service was wonderful. The waitress was super about my friend and I pretty much camping out for a few hours while we waited to be able to check into our hotel. It's also a really cute street to hang out on for a while, beautiful buildings and lots of shops to look at if you're seated outside. Definitely recommend.",

    "text": "Don't miss a meal at this wee little restaurant tucked into the curve of Cockburn Street. The Italian food served out of their kitchen is top-notch. Everything from the decor to the wine list to the presentation is well-considered. They also offer a blackboard of daily specials in addition to their regular menu. My choices were from the specials. I started with a bowl of stracciatella soup with cheese tortellini and artisanal bread. The soup was perfectly hot when it arrived. The broth was seasoned well and totally delicious. Even the bread was nicely toasted and dressed with olive oil, sea salt and a flurry of rosemary. As a main, I had the linguine with clams, prawns and roasted cherry tomatoes. The pasta was lovely--al dente and savory with a touch of the wonderful shellfish flavors melded in. Expertly paired with a dry Pinot Grigio. For dessert, you won't regret ordering the tiramisu--it is creamy, fluffy and absolutely heavenly. Service was friendly, welcoming and accommodating. A gem in Edinburgh!",

    "text": "I came here after perusing previous Yelp reviews, their online menu and a craving for Italian. Their restaurant is very cute and cozy, definitely what you'd expect from an authentic Italian restaurant. There is also outdoor seating for prime people watching. The set up alone gets five stars, unfortunately that's where the accolades end.   I paid 20 for a lunch size portion-8 puny pieces-of ravioli and a glass of off-brand Rose. What in the inflation hell? It would not have been so bad if the ravioli weren't so tiny and lacking in flavor. These were seriously the puniest ravioli I'd ever seen, and they were barely stuffed with any spinach. I had originally wanted their mushroom ravioli, which looked and sounded glorious on their website. But they didn't have any ready for lunch. Okay cool, I want to have space to savor some of the limoncello cheesecake that they have featured on their menu, but oops, they don't have any of that ready, either. Seriously?? I understand small businesses have to make do, but if it's ON the lunch menu that you've placed before me, why isn't it available?? So frustrating. They offered me a sample of their 'cheesecake bar', which was essentially a lump of brown sugar. So now I've spent the equivalent of a 3 course dinner meal on an unfulfilling lunch. What's more infuriating is that there are PLENTY of eateries in this area that legitimately offer 3 course lunch and dinner for a fraction of what I paid. Ugh. Maybe dinner is the best time to visit, too bad I'll never know.   A quick word to management if you're reading: no one wants to hear you berate your new employee while trying to enjoy a meal. Maybe consider taking your administrative business off of the dining floor. Yes, it's your place, but it's very distracting and extremely off-putting.   Cheers!",

    "text": "Italian food on a cold wet Sunday night for dinner sounded perfect to me when my friend suggested La Laconda.   This place is a cute bistro that has a romantic and cozy atmosphere. The tables are small, but the place can accommodate a group perfectly fine since the tables can be easily moved around.   The menu is fairly simple. They offer about 4-5 different types of small plates and only 4 different mains from their menu: spaghetti with meatballs, Italian sausage, chicken Milanese, frittata. They did offer 3 additional mains from their special which were all written out on a chalkboard. With my indecisiveness I chose the spicy Italian sausage.   The dish came out awesome. It had tons of vegetables, 2 Italian sausages laid on top of a bed of spinach and 4 slices of focaccia bread. The sausages were very flavourful as a result of the various spices it contained. Though the sausages were split in half, the outer part of the sad sausages had a snap when I bit it. The salad wasn't anything special but it was the perfect pairing with the sausage since it brought a coolness to the spice. The focaccia bread were cut in small pieces and were crunch outside but chewy inside.   I decided not to get dessert, but instead get a hot chocolate. I ordered their special hot chocolate that came with marshmallows and a chocolate flake. The hot chocolate was rich but not overly dense and the marshmallows definitely made it richer and over the top. I couldn't finish it and ended up sharing it with my friend.   The only disappointment I had was the fact that they didn't have my favourite Italian red wine- Sangiovese. First Italian restaurant I went to that didn't have any or ran out. Gutted... Oh well, maybe next time!  I like this place because the food was on point, the staff were nice and helpful, and the decoration as well as the set up of the restaurant made me forget I was in Edinburgh but transported somewhere else. For that, I give this restaurant a thumbs up since most restaurant can't easily do that!",

Cappuccino was lovely and I managed to avoid the amazing selection of cakes. (DIET 1: CAKE 0)   I met my friend and we decided to pop in for lunch. Again, we were greeted warmly (there was a chorus of 'You're back!!') and we both chose to order paninis (9.00 each). I had one with tomato and mozzarella which was delicious. I really enjoyed the accompanying salad which comes with a balsamic dressing.   It's a really cute, cosy place and the staff do a great job. I'd definitely recommend popping into La Locanda!",

It was cold, damp and rainy outside but we were greeted with a smile that was very warm. I had a porcini mushroom and potato soup that was delicious. The rosemary in the soup was a lovely touch. Joe had the bruschetta and devoured every morsel. The balsamic vinegar was syrupy and dense and totally incredible. The olives were fresh and firm. The waitstaff was so accommodating, we had the lasagna and they prepared an order of spaghetti and meatballs that was not on the menu that night for me and Joe to split. They did not seem annoyed by the request and actually suggested that we split the entrees so we could sample each other's dish without any fuss. Both entrees were wonderful. Fresh and flavorful and ample portions. We could not eat dessert but the desserts looked great. The biggest thing I remember from the meal was how kind the staff was to everyone in the restaurant. Smiling and gracious to everyone. The meal was excellent but the staff made the experience for me.",

They could not accommodate a party of three at the moment and said that if I wait a bit perhaps something would open up, so I opted to wait it out as most places were booked up. While waiting I sat on a bench outside. I asked the waiter (who knew I was waiting to see if a table opened up as he was the one I spoke with) for the wifi password so I could text my two friends and update them and he informed me it was only for customers and that I shouldn't even be sitting on the bench as technically that is for customers too (no one else was even on it or waiting). Basically he kicked me out of the perimeter of the place. I really don't get it. I'm not one to blame racism usually as that is a hand sometimes over dealt, but given how he acted with the white customers next to me versus me, I'm really at a loss. At a minimum horrible service. Too bad, or perhaps not; the food looked crappy from what I could see during my short \"unlawful\" seating.",
