I was surprised how quickly the pizza arrived and it was really tasty. I had the most expensive one and I would expect the standard pizzas to be more value for money (home made Napolitano sausage for around 6-9  is quite good!). Not quite as good as my favourite restaurant in Italy, but surely well worth a visit!",

I also had their beer that was on tap. That pizza had great flavor. The servers were pleasant and accommodating.   The service was great. Bonus: the table next to us couldn't finish their Prosecco and gave it to us! Thank you to the two ladies.   There is also a ramp, so the restaurant is accessible.",

It is pretty standard Naples style pizza.  The main recommendation I have is to split a pizza with someone else, since the portions are very large for a single person.",

    "text": "A pleasant surprise in the overloaded pizza restaurant market of Edinburgh.  Pizza Posto is located opposite to the Festival Theatre, on Nicolson Street, where a decade ago used to be the infamous Ti Amo restaurant.  First things first, front of house (which ever waiter is free-ish) accommodated me in no time in one of its front tables, which was a bit drafty as single window panels have no sealant between them, but it wasn't a big deal.  I ordered the pizza number 5 with spicy Italian salami, mozzarella, tomato base and olive oil plus mushrooms as an extra topping.  The order took a bit long to arrive as the pizza chefs were dealing with a couple of over-populated tables. The service was efficient but a bit detached.   The number 5 looks really good and healthy (AKA no dripping grease) and tasted like the genuine article as you can identify and degust the main flavours, from the properly made pizza dough, to the good quality mozzarella, aromatic tomato sauce and the tasty but not that fiery spicy salami. The added mushrooms came from an oil marinated mushrooms flask rather than their fresh counterpart, nevertheless it was a great flavour addition to the number 5.   The quality/price ratio was really good as the number 5 was  8 +  1 for the extra topping, a price that cannot be beaten in the Edinburgh catering scene.  I'll certainly go back to try some other flavour combinations.  Recommended.",

    "text": "Too few people know about Pizza Posto. It looks fairly new, and is kind of in a busy area near the uni and the Festival Theatre, so I wonder why it wasn't so busy when I popped in.  I was seeing a musical called SIX at the Underbelly in George Square. I'd just picked up my ticket from their box office and had just over an hour and 15 minutes to kill before the show. I remembered seeing a nice looking pizza place around the corner so headed back up there.  I walked in, got seated immediately, and promptly ordered myself a margarita pizza and a can of Coke. Now in a place like this - authentic clay ovens, exposed bricks and lightbulbs, you would expect it to be nearly 16 but my bill only came to 7.50 at the end of it all.  The service is good too. The waitresses I encountered were friendly and efficient at bringing out the food. The barman seemed pretty funny too.  For a pre-theatre meal in the Southside, it just has to be here. It's cheap, quick and much better supporting a local business than overpriced chains such as Pizza Hut and Dominos.",

    "text": "Huge restaurant with ample seating, which, to me would generally mean you're going to get perhaps decent food, but nothing that transcends... but no! This was our top choice for pizza in town, and had all the flavor and blistered-crust glory of the kind of pie you'd get in some little intimate gourmand or mom-and-pop Italian spot, yet in a cavernous space that could house a Times Square crowd. It was for sure a surprise, but a very happy one, and we came back a few times because we liked it that much.  The prices are quite reasonable and the pizza, oh it's so good. While you're plenty fine with anything on the menu (I'm a big fan of anything with garlic, mozz, tomato and pepperoni-- or spicy salami, I guess they say here?) number ten's \"award-winning Grande Italia\" was SO good-- it came with a WHOLE BURRATA on top! That's like an appetizer with your pizza. Loved cutting it up and spreading it on some crust. They ship in their ingredients from Italy, which often is a gimmick when restaurants make claims like that, but having traveled to Italy literally a week after eating here, I can say it's legit. (San Marzano tomatoes are everything!) Ironically, the pizza we had in Italy wasn't even as good as here, but that's another sad story. So... go here while you can! (Also, give their pizza specials a try, since those change and always sound interesting!)",

The exterior would have you believe you're about to eat at a Sbarro, but this place is far from that. Five stars. Simply amazing pizza. Don't let the neon lights fool you, enjoy!",
