The menu was really impressive, drizzled in this and sauteed in that, .....meh!!  The price was through the roof as expected. Staff were really friendly and OTT.

A small group of us went here for a friends 21st. Located on top of the Museum of Scotland, this restaurant has fantastic views. That is where the fantastic ends.  \"Excuse me waiter but someone has eaten half my food.\"  Oh wait, it is just one of those super pretentious places where you need a magnifying glass to look at your overpriced food. Maybe I wouldn't have minded so much if the food had been out of this world, but it wasn't. Comparing it to the Michelin starred Number One, this restaurant falls way behind.  Another negative point was the restaurant was so damn quiet that whenever any of us girls got up to the toilet in our heels all you could hear was \"clunk clunk clunk'' on the wooden floor.   Sadly I found this experience a little disapointing.",

My steak knife could though have done with being sharperas the breast required a fair bit of sawing through once or twice. The Saturday before Valentine's Day was always likely to be busy I suppose and the staff were clearly kept going all evening. Being seated in the first banquette by the entrance we were afforded the opportunity to overhear their moans about each other and their admonishments for poor timekeeping, which made for an inclusive touch. The service on the whole was attentive and at times mildly pretentious as noted by previous reviewers (some of the other diners clearly fell into the pretentious camp too of course) but was let down badly at the end of the night when it took nearly ten minutes to locate two of our five coats. It should also be made clearer that upon arrival you're expected to advise the security guards of which booking you are, rather than have them get shirty.",

I could never have afforded this restaurant on my own accord. The atmosphere is very romantic - it's a very stylish place. I was in awe of this place and spent a good 10 minutes sheepishly taking it in. Let's bear in mind this is probably the fanciest place I have ever been too.   Food was not cheap. We went straight for main courses. I had the beef bourginon (sp?) for 18. It came with creamed potato and shalotts. It was definitely some of the best beef I've had - tender and very well-cooked. For dessert I had a chocolate torte (6.50) and this was heavenly. It really made my night. Not too rich and came with berries and berry sauce and 2 large milk and White chocolate wedges in the middle. I definitely recommend this - my compliments to the chef!  I also recommend the Australian fruity rosy wine they served (I forget the name). I am not much of a wine drinker but I loved it.   This is a pricey restaurant. It isn't the cheapest but I found it very pleasant and the staff are very courteous. If you have the money to spare then I definitely recommend it.   I thoroughly enjoyed my venture into the world of upmarket fine foods.",

We sat by the window with a great view of the Castle - all lit up.   Food was fresh and tasty too. My risotto was cooked perfectly and husbands duck was excellent too.   It's not cheap - we paid about 50 a head - but we felt that was reasonable for excellent food, wine, service and ambience.   I have eaten at the Witchery and Prestonfield House and good to see that The Tower lives us to the standard.",

The food however, was average and disappointing.   My husband had the scallops to start which were the highlight of the meal, but for 15 it was a tiny portion. For the main course I had the eggs benedict, unfortunately the egg yolk was not runny, which I would have expected. My husband ordered the ribeye steak (rare). It appeared and it was medium well, so it had to be sent back. A major setback by such a highly acclaimed restaurant.   We had the trio of chocolate puddings for two for dessert which was fine, but nothing particularly special.   On the whole very disappointing.",

The day me and my colleagues visited it, it was slightly dull and wet so we couldn't enjoy it fully but the staff and the service made up for it. I didn't expect to be called 'Milady', not to that aristocratic point and gloss, but the special dish I ordered was divinely delicious and I didn't regret the costly price I paid for it. Of course, it is a place I wouldn't visit very often because of its upmarket standard but for special occasions it is a fantastic, peaceful and enjoyable venue.",

My taxi driver had suggested the Witchery but warned me I probably couldn't get in without a reservation. He was right and the first table they had was 10.15pm :( But the Witchery host suggested their sister restaurant the Tower located at the top of the Museum of Scotland. Seemed more my speed as while we were talking everyone going into the Witchery was in their 60s. Went to the Tower restaurant and had a great meal. Started with what I will fondly remember as one of the best martinis ever. The oysters were awesome as was the grilled salmon and veggies. Dessert was a fruit tart - very unmemorable and don't remember the fruit. The space is very cool and overall would highly recommend the place if you're a tourist and looking for a nice place for dinner as it is on the steep side.",

    "text": "I came here in June for afternoon tea with 5 of my ladies wot lunch companions and there was much excitement on the lead up to this day out!   Bellies empty and ready to go, one hungover, one eating for 2, the Tower had better come up trumps!  As there was 6 of us we were seated at a long table and we were given 3 cake stands piled high.   Hopefully the photos I've posted do it justice.  I can tell you, from my own taste point of view, it was amazing and I couldn't stop eating and very little was left.  We did have to stop a few times for a breather, but we carried on, simply because it was just so delish. I thought everything was homemade and fresh.  I've had afternoon teas before that frankly are a bit stale and look to me like they have been frozen or come out of a stale biscuit tin.  I particularly liked the fact the cakes were very light so you did actually stand a chance to get through the savouries, scones and sweets!!  We had sandwiches, savoury tarts, mini bruschetta, scones, plain and sultana, clotted cream and jam.  Fruit cake, shortbread, creme brulee, chocolate cherry mousse cake, strawberry mille-feuille.....gosh, I'm sure there was more!  To accompany your afternoon tea you get unlimited coffee and tea, bags and loose.   After dining, the weather was so lovely we sat outside to enjoy a glass of champagne!  If you have a smaller appetite or are just not terribly hungry, I would recommend  perhaps sharing an afternoon tea  - but don't even think about sharing mine!!    The afternoon tea menu changes with the seasons as a friend dined on it during November and hers was different, but I'm glad the menu changes because I can't wait to go back again!!  Afternoon Tea is 15.95pp and with Champagne its 25pp.  If there was one tiny negative, some of the group did comment that whilst the staff were pleasant, after we were served, nobody came back to ask if everything was okay.  A minor point and whilst everything was okay, its still nice to have a wee bit attentiveness.  When we wanted re-fills on drinks and condiments, we had to ask, rather than being asked but equally, we were left to get on with chatting and eating and not bothered by over attentive staff, so its getting a happy medium with service, so only for that do I not give the Tower 5 stars.  But overall, fabulous and its my No. 1 place for afternoon tea, until I find something that exceeds this gourmet feast.",

It's entrance via the national museum of Scotland is interesting and exciting. It's outside terrace is one of the best rooftop views of the castle and old town and a big selling point.  On this visit service was good, not exceptional and the food was very nice but didn't blow me away as you would expect from a fancy place. Haggis starter with pineapple and whiskey jus was tasty but served on a cold plate. This annoys me about nice places as by the time everything is plated with fancy swirls and stuff and described to you in great unnecessary detail your food is barely warm! Anyway without sounding like a moaning trip adviser reviewer the main courses were much better... ribeye steak was cooked perfectly with hand cut twice cooked chips with buttery bernaise sauce was very nice and an interesting deconstructed kind of chicken pie looked and tasted superb. Our party of 4 each had aperitifs, starters, mains , sides, 1 bottle wine, beers  and water for 291 so it is an expensive outing. I do like it here but feel it needs to up its game if it wants to be up there with the big boys. Nevertheless I would go back again to enjoy it's splendid view , drinks and food.",

The small fried fish which I got as an appetizer was too salty to really be consumed and the white fish that I had as an entree was bland and somewhat unsatisfying.

    "text": "At first sight this place looked so pretentious that I spent almost five mins before to decide to get in.  I was visiting the National Museum and, after exploring the beautiful sections focused on the earliest human settlements and on the incredible journey of the Scottish platform throughout the whole emisphere, I went to the last floor, to have a break before going to meet the Vikings and the other sections and hosted collections.  After looking at the tables, the maitre, the waiters and mainly felt the chilly athmosphere, my first intention was to jump in the lift, running away as soon as possible.  My curiosity, instead, forced me to read the menu. There I found a couple of dishes that hooked me: Scottish Langoustine Salad and Haggis Neeps and Tatties. It was already sunday morning and after three full days in Edinburgh I was still missing my first taste of Haggis!  Then I went in.  The Langoustine Salad came with all the machinery of the case. The langoustine was fair, but nothing special. The best part was the veggie side: a surprisingly fresh and vary and tasty salad. The Haggis was breadcrumbed and deep fried, served in three quenelle-shaped pieces on three islands of thick mashed tatties and three sticks of turnips. Good, good and funny.  The haggis taste was unexpected to me. In my hometown there are several recipes with almost the same ingredients, but the result is very different and the flavour is more on the \"rough\" side of the scale.  During the lunch I also noticed some useful breaks in the rigid and formal attitude of the waiters. When needed, also the maitre successfully helped them to make the customers' staying more comfortable. This place may become by far more attractive and cosy, if they would be motivated to take their potential to a more flexible and friendly level (especially at lunch).  I was almost deciding to calculate the vote following Rayan D's average: 4 for the food + 2 for the place = 3 stars, but the beautiful views over the city and the castle easily balanced some useless formalism, so my final result is still 4 :)",

    "text": "I booked the Tower for Afternoon tea after taking in some sights in Edinburgh. My sister had previously dined there and raved about it, so I figured I should give it a try. We were a group of 6 and just wanted some tea before dinner and the Military Tattoo later that evening. The restaurant is very nice with large windows so that you can take in the views of  Edinburgh Castle and its surroundings. Immediately after being seated, one of the head servers automatically put in the order for 6 Afternoon Teas without explaining to us how much food is on the tray. I looked around and asked another server for some information about the tea platter. She was very helpful and told us if we planned to eat dinner later then 6 would be too much. She was absolutely right. I was thankful for her honesty, as not only was it a lot of food but each person was charged around $30. She recommended getting 3 trays and splitting it, which is what we did. The food was very good but not outstanding. The other factor that made me give such a mediocre rating was the lack of a bathroom when we were there. I asked where are the toilets?  The staff said you have to go downstairs into the museum!  I went down and the museum security (museum was now closed) told me that there is no men's room here you have to go to another floor!  I think that that was poor service on the part of the Tower, and would expect much more from what has been hailed as an excellent restaurant.",

The waiters/waitresses are all very polite, but for the price I'm paying there I'd expect to have much better food.  It appeared to me as if they're sacrificing too much from quality to cut their costs. I'll give a simple example. The olives they bring as a starter are cheap pitted ones that taste like rubber. Order olives at the Outsider (George IV Bridge) and you'll see the difference.  Anyways, I'm not too worried about the quality of olives, but as a whole I've had much better food at much lower prices in Edinburgh. They've got a nice view of the castle, though:)",

    "text": "This was the first place I ever went for a swanky meal in Edinburgh, and although it was a lovely meal I have to say I certainly wouldn't be hurrying back again if I were paying the bill!  That's why I'm only giving it 3 stars - although you expect to pay a certain amount in a nice restaurant, I did feel that the prices here were a little excessive. Although now they've brought in a pre-theatre early bird menu for 16.95, if you're eating from the a la carte menu in the evening you can expect to pay 35-40 per head without drinks.  That said, the food was still very good. I went for the Smoked eel, Toasted Rye, Mustard Mayo and Cornichon Salsa for starters followed by the Guinea Fowl with Walnut Stuffing, Squash Puree and Wilted Kale. Although everything was cooked perfectly and presentation was impeccable, you don't have to be a genius to be able to see that the menu does sound a little bit unnecessarily pretentious.  There were however some things that made this restaurant stand out, and why I thought about awarding it 4 stars. For one, it's perched on top of the National Museum and so the views over the city are second to none, especially if you're there at sunset like I was. If you're there for lunch then a wander through the museum at the end is always a good way to walk off your meal.  Also, although I found it odd that service wasn't included in the prices, little things like not needing to ask for your coat at the end as it's already being held out for you to put on - or even to remind the staff which one is yours - definitely score brownie points.  If you're the kind of foodie who's main concern is being seen in the 'right' restaurants, then this is your kind of place. If you're the kind of foodie who genuinely loves great food and wine, I'd definitely pay this place a visit at some point but I wouldn't put it at the top of your list.",

Knowledge to have before you book a table here is that it is pricier than most, but I don't think it's too extortionate considering it's clearly aimed at the higher end of the market, plus there are a fair few restaurants in Edinburgh that operate on similar price levels, and I do think Edinburgh can be a pretty expensive city in general.  I had a meal at the Tower for my birthday a while back, and was unsure what to expect, aside from brillant views across Edinburgh, which the venue certainly delivers. Can't beat a fantastic view on a good day while you're eating your food, so that elevates the experience before you've really started to analyse the meal. I went for the juicy and mostly always satisfying steak option, which was slightly more well done than I would have liked, however I think this was because I asked for it to be cooked medium, when I really should have asked for it to be rare. I think it was more a shift in the way I like to eat a steak, than an inaccurate cooking judgment on the restaurant's part. I enjoyed the sultry, nicely mood lit atmosphere of the Tower, and would recommend it for anyone who likes their dinner date with sweeping views.",

It didn't come, and it didn't come, and our waiter was nowhere to be seen. After 40 minutes husband flagged down another server to check on our food and, voila!, it came right away.  He said his soup was mediocre at best, while my eggs Benny was terrible, the eggs were barely poached, still runny whites even, and the meat texture reminded me of jerky, and the whole thing had a really sour taste.

Based on the other reviews here, the restaurant is a high-end one, but perhaps because we were in a large group, the elegant service didn't become too apparent, as we were probably more interested in chatting with each other.  So I do commend the patience of the staff. I am pretty sure there were questions asked, like when we were ordering, yet the staff had a hard time harnessing our attention, because we were so involved in our own things. I saw the staff trying their best to navigate through all of this, even folding our napkins and laying it on to our laps, even while all the chaos is happening.  The afternoon tea set was great! And the collection of tea was also superb. I don't have afternoon tea in my lexicon of activities: I find it weird to have a heavy snack after lunch and before dinner, yet I was impressed with what I got nevertheless. My husband who avoid dairy was given a different option: he basically had a light lunch with a starter and a main course, and from what I can see, those were top notch as well.  I typically don't go to restaurants that are somehow attached to other establishments like museums for no particular reason, but the fact that this is a good one suggests that I should keep an open mind.",

    "text": "We booked here for our last night together in edinburgh, I'm personally always more fussed about the food than being up high for a view, but my friend (she's even more petite than me, so maybe that's the reason, haha) seems to really like being high up, every place she goes she's up gazing out of the window of a shard equivalent, but I wasn't disappointed by here.   I felt a little over dressed, it was a dress I wear all of the time and had been wearing all day but I think it's a but more of a smart casual place because you're too cool to make an effort but you're well presented anyway.  Our waiter was lovely, and we picked gorgeous cocktails, one so particularly lovely that my friend took down the ingredients to make at home.  Seeing the portions travel past, we decided to keep starter to antipasti so we could fit in a pudding.  The had a good amount of game and fish on the menu, which made me very happy, and clare went for lobster and chips.  My meat was perfectly cooked, and presented well.   For puddings, clare had, if i remember rightly a salted caramel torte, on such a beautifully put together plate. I however, was drawn in by nostalgia, and just had to go for the banana split, which came in the sort of heavy cut glass that you'd expect in the harbour bar.  The contrast between the dishes was excellent, and really made us chuckle.   The view of course, is wonderful, and best from the terrace, which is much more comfortable in the warm!",

The entire dining experience was here from being greeted at the entrance by waiting staff, the exceptional quality of service, the amazing views of the castle and the fantastic food to cap it all.   The menu choices where excellent and exceeded only by the extensive wine and drinks listing (including plenty of options for pockets deeper than mine!).  Overall I cannot recommend the tower restaurant highly enough and will certainly make and effort to return the next time I visit Edinburgh.",

But most of all having dined in 5 star restaurants across the world I have never been made to feel so out of place with snooty wait staff that I felt treated me differently than their British patrons.  I was dressed appropriately and wanted to enjoy a late dinner after touring the city and I was so disappointed.  I spent a lot of pounds and didn't really enjoy the capstone to my evening due to the peculiarly unwelcoming staff.  The view from the restaurant of the castle is beautiful and it is a shame that the service is so lacking.  I did the prefixe menu and it was 3 courses and then I added a tea course at the end as well, so I feel like I got to sample a bit of everything.",

    "text": "The Tower reflects a certain type of Edinburgh restaurant much like it's related sibling The Witchery (by the same restauranteur). Formal, fine-dining style presentation and food in often spectacular surroundings.   It's therefore quite hard to give this kind of a place a rating. It does indeed have fantastic views of the castle from it's rooftop terrace. The food was all cooked pretty well and there wasn't much to fault about it. At the same time, there is nothing that really stood out or got me particularly excited.   I had a set menu as part of a work Christmas lunch; perhaps the a la carte dinner may have been more compelling but it would also have been more expensive. I feel bad for fancy restaurants that feel obliged to serve traditional turkey Christmas dinner and somehow make it seem interesting. This one did taste pretty good but it wasn't the most appetising plate of food I've ever seen (brussel sprouts aren't the most attractive food in the world). At least they tried though.  The chocolate terrine looked the part though. It tasted pretty much like a chocolate terrine.  I feel the Tower is really more aimed towards tourists who think that a view of the castle is quite novel, or parents taking students for a fancy meal after graduation. If someone took me for a meal here I certainly wouldn't complain. Spending my own money though, for this type of on fine dining I'd go for something like The Kitchin with it's locally sourced produce or Timberyard with it's more adventurous menu.",

Its on the top floor of the building and has a great view of the castle from the window so be sure to ask for a window table if possible and you must book in advance for Afternoon tea, the day before will suffice.  They had a good selection of teas although they could have been more attentive on refills. The food is presented on a nice slate tower and the waiter explained what everything was. I was a little disappointed by the lack of sandwiches although the ones that were there (egg/cress and chicken) were very nice. Where was the cream cheese and cucumber and cheese/pickle though?! I would expect the full complement of sandwiches for the price we paid.  All the cakes and pastries were great and we left feeling fairly satisfied. I probably wouldn't go back as there are many other places that, with some forward planning, would likely be a better option such as The Dome and The Balmoral.",

Me and my dining partner in crime, Steven, decided to take advantage of the Edinburgh Restaurant Festival that is happening this week. They are offering 3 courses for 25, amazing value. Check out the website for more restaurant offers.   As it is situated on the top floor of The National Museum, the view from The Tower is a beautiful panorama of Edinburgh's skyline. We were lucky enough have an amazing sunset whilst we dined. So romantic! From the moment you step into The Tower you are treated like royalty. The staff cannot help you enough and they were very attentive during our entire visit.   The decor is stylish and beautifully decadent but not over the top. The lighting is soft and romantic, perfect for an intimate dinner. We had three choices for each course; I went for the squid followed by cod and the roasted plums for dessert. The wine list is vast with wines from all over the globe, they are not cheap though. We went for one in our price range of 35. It was very nice.   The food arrived in good time and it was all stunning! I felt rude taking photos so sorry no piccys. This cod was not something you would find in your local chippy, it was thick, plump and perfectly cooked. The stars of the show had to be the desserts. My plums came with a burnt butter ice cream. I cannot put into words how awesome this was, you just need to try it for yourself.   This place is pricey but it's so worth it. Go on, treat yourself, you deserve it!   Cheers, Amy",

The restaurant is located on the fifth-floor terrace above the Museum of Scotland. Drag your eyes away from the view outside and there's a whole landscape of well-sourced Scottish produce on the menu: hand-dived scallops, Pork loins, lobster, beef, heritage potatoes, and so on.  Haggis bon bons with your crispy squid and a home made pork pie while moules mariners are very well cooked and reminiscent of summer holidays in the Vendee. The poached pear and creme brulees are a lovely end to the meal as the sun sets...  The only problem is that the food isn't quite as good as it should be. It has so much promise and sounds so tasty but it just misses hitting the nail on the head in the way so many other Edinburgh havens do. Having eaten at all the sister restaurants of the group I do feel the food is sub standard to their offerings and would always favour the Witchery or Prestonfield. Lovely view though and a great spot for a cocktail if not a little pricey.",
