    "text": "This is a pretty cool pizza joint with a good selection of pizzas and a wide range of toppings. I have a close friend who lives 5 minutes down the road from here so quite often popped in just before or after seeing them. The pizzas here are not quite to the quality of Domino's or Pizza Hut but a lot closer to that quality than they are from your standard greasy pizza place, but at really great prices. They do some pretty good student deals here, if I was getting a pizza on my own I opted for a large twelve inch pizza with four toppings which was 6, or if I was sharing I got an eighteen inch pizza with four toppings which is very reasonably prices at 10.50- just over a fiver each, which offers good value for money.",

    "text": "This little place really surprised me. To be honest I wasn't expecting much when I ventured in, but I was in the area and was in that mood where I would have seriously considered committing major crimes to get a pizza. Lo and behold I came across this ol' joint; looks like serendipity had my back. I was wary at first but through caution to the winds and ordered, if my memory serves me correctly, a meaty beast of a pizza with a token amount of onions so I can persuade myself I had a healthy intake of veg. Hey with the tomato puree on there that's almost two of my five a day. Couple that with the apples in the cider I'd had in the pub earlier and I was feeling pretty healthy to be honest.   The pizza, when it eventually came, smelled awesome and upon taking it home and devouring it was not disappointed. All the ingredients complemented each other well - I'm not going to take credit for this, the guy there did give me advice on which things to mix and which to avoid - and I was stuffed well before finishing it. For the price (about 7 or 8) it was excellent value, and tasted almost as good again when I unashamedly rocked the old student cliche and reheated it for breakfast. A good find",

    "text": "Pizza Factory is a huge industrial complex that pumps out a constant supply that makes up 75% of the world's pizzas. Actually it's a small takeaway pizza joint, but it does feel mass produced.  I'm not a huge fan of Pizza Factory but I think I can understand why it is popular. There really is a huge range of toppings that you can \"create your own pizza\" with (by create your own they mean select each ingredient  you want on the pizza at 70p each). You can choose from the usual mushroom and peperoni, to the more interesting like feta or walnuts. This did allow me as a vegetarian to be a bit more picky. After all out of their set pizzas I think there was only one vegetarian option (the \"Colosseum\").  Most set pizzas cost 6.60. I find this a little steep as for not much more you could visit a pretty great Italian restaurant. But nevertheless the quality of pizzas here really isn't half bad. I'm not a fan of takeaways in general, but I do prefer pizza. There's something a bit harder to fake in a veggie pizza, unlike an anonymous kebab. If you feel the same way then maybe Pizza Factory is worth a visit.",

    "text": "I like this place because of the massive variety of toppings you cna have on your pizza. Chilli beef, Roman artichokes, smoked pork sausage, feta cheese and walnuts, strange things that you've never tried but (but must!).  The prices are amazing too, we got a 16 inch for under 11 which fed like 5 of us. It took a little while to cook but that's because they made it fresh.  This place can't be beat!",
