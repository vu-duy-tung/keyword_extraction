Quesadilla arrived with blob of runny sour cream on top and a smear of salsa. Restaurant was nearly empty, so there was no reason for our food to be sloppily put together. Beef burrito was literally beef, and nothing but beef, wrapped in a flour tortilla. Quesadilla was filled with watery chicken and almost no cheese. Also, quesadilla was not cooked well enough that you could cut off a piece and pick it up as you can with most.   Server asked us how our food was without really giving us time to answer, and never returned.   Pluses: Bathrooms were clean. Cheesy decor. (Pinatas? Really?)   Really irritated with how high the prices were with quality that low, especially during a recession when eating out is a special treat.",

I am a big fan of Mexican food and I found this place to be a bit too quiet for my taste, however this was at lunchtime and perhaps it changes in the evening.   I think Pancho Villas is mostly suited to tourists due to its location and I dont think anyone would be disappointed.

The restaurant is very prettily decorated in a Mexican style, but tables are crammed in too close together, which makes it difficult to have a quiet meal without someone needing past to go to the toilet. At the weekends it can get very busy with large groups and therefore very noisy; whereas during the week it is the opposite end of the spectrum in that you could hear a pin drop.   The food was fairly standard Mexican fare and nothing that jumped out hugely. Prices were fairly reasonably, and portion sizes were good, but in all honesty i expected a little more from this place.",

However if you don't have your expectations too high, Pancho Villas should keep you fairly happy.   The portions aren't the most generous, but the food is tasty enough and the margaritas are excellent. I like the decor, though they could do with some soft furnishings to damp the noise down when busy. Being a bit further down the Royal Mile than most restaurants it's sometimes possible to get a table there when you can't get one further up the hill. Pancho Villas is a pretty neat place to have lunch, and they have a few items on the menu for vegetarians, which is always a bonus!",

I actually complained, which I only do in extreme circumstances, and the waitress apologised and brought me back a new plate, another 20 minutes later. I was not a happy bunny. Not at all. The replacement wasn't much better either.  I must have got them on a bad day because the food in Pancho Villas is usually very good and well cooked. No tip was left that day!",

Front of house/waiter Pablo greeted me in no time at all, getting me a table and menu in seconds, which was cool as I was kind of starving. I ordered the Sopes, petite corn cakes topped with beans and potato & chorizo as a starter. They were tasty, crunchy and leaving a flavoursome after taste of corn that reminded me \"humita\" (savoury steamed fresh corn cakes) dishes that I tried in the Entre Rios province of Argentina.  After that I attacked a delicious Carne Enchilada with the shredded beef; spicy with the right level of \"hotness\" that allows you to taste the added herb flavours in all its glory, all of that topped with abundant melted cheese. The only minor downside of the whole experience was that portions' presentations were a bit lacklustre and on the smallish side of the scale.  Kudos to attentive and efficient waiter Pablo who delivered a very good service.  Pancho Villa's prices are very affordable considering its High Street/Royal Mile location. Will certainly go back for a re-fill any time soon.",

I had the cracked crab enchiladas and a tequila sticky toffee pudding for dessert. The cracked crab enchiladas were very good, but the dessert was A-MA-ZING! We had some red wine to go with dinner, it could have been a little colder, as it was definitely warmer than room temperature, but no biggie.   They also have a selection of 6 different tequila's, and a list of cocktails, which are really good! The decor is very bright and a little cheesy, but fun nonetheless. The staff is always attentive and we were served quickly and with a smile.  Would recommend this place to anyone in need of some Mexican food! :)",

I ate there in July of 2014. It's about a 7-8 minute walk down(!) from St. Giles Cathedral on the Royal Mile. The decor is simple but pleasant, the service competent and moderately friendly.  I had coriander-seasoned spare ribs as a starter (delicious) and fajitas with various sauces and onions (some assembly required, and not bad) as a mains. Can't really complain! See my photos.  As many restaurants/bistros in this touristy area, it does get busy on weeknights and weekends. So do consider a reservation. Prices at this place are rather on the competitive end of the Royal Mile restaurants, beer selection is basic. Not a place to linger I guess.",

    "text": "I wanted to like this place. I really did. The decor reminded my of some of my favorite Mexican places from home. Then I heard Spanish being spoken and my heart almost stopped with joy. Then the food arrived and the joy stopped. I ordered my usual chicken burrito and was disappointed from the first bite.  My burrito consisted of shredded chicken meat, which was over seasoned and tough, and that was it. No beans, no salsa, no cheese. NOTHING. I hate to tell you kids, but shredded meat does not a burrito make.  The plate also had an over abundance of dry \"flavored\" rice and a pitiful amount of salsa. It was really some of the worst Mexican I have had around Europe.   The reason why I gave this place two stars is because of the service. Seriously. These guys were nice, prompt, polite, and a basic joy. I would go back for beer and nachos just for them.",

When you're on the apposite site of the rock from Mexico I get that you have to make substitutions. First test - the salsa.  was up to par, not excellent but not yucky either. I had the barbacoa, it was excellent but wished it could have had some jalapeno slices and or some leafy garnish to add crunch.  My husband had burritos or something that was quickly devoured so i'm guessing it wasn't bad.   Service was prompt and friendly.  Prices were fair and the food was good.",

I have had better chili from several pubs and Illegal Jack's, cheaper too. Enchiladas and Fajitas were also uninspired and lacking a spice hit.  A friend said they make a great margarita, however if I need to be inebriated to enjoy the food I don't see the point of paying a restaurant price.  To use the description so handily provided by yelp; meh, I've experienced better.",

    "text": "So ... we've been in the UK since January and have missed real Mexican food. Consider that I had spent the last six months of 2012 in California where real Mexican food can be found just around the corner from where ever you are.   We were wandering down the Royal Mile, intending to eat at a restaurant where we had reservations only to find that they closed about 30 minutes after our reservation time. Not wanting to be rushed, we looked across the street, saw Pancho Villas, and decided to take a risk. After all, how would the UK's interpretation of Mexican food taste? Imagine my surprise and delight to have a meal similar to what I would find in southern California. Granted, ingredient substitutions are made based on what's available in the UK however considering that the owner is Mexican and some of his staff are Mexican, I appreciated finally finding tasty Mexican food in the UK.",

Nothing spectacular.  Service was nothing to write home about. We were shown to a table which still had napkins on the floor.   I don't have anything overly negative to say but don't have much positive to say either. I wouldn't choose to dine here again.",

    "text": "So I decided to venture from my usual Mexican restaurant on this trip to Edinburgh to try a new one.  I read the menu while I was standing outside and that's why I decided to try it.  The first waitress kept rushing me along saying, \"This table is booked for 7.  Ok?\"  I got it the first time.  I think I had 3 waitresses during my short dinner.  The last two, however, were very attentive and very hospitable.  I ordered a Corona to go with my meal...and it wasn't cold at all.  The Tortilla Soup was not quite what I expected, but I have to say it looked beautiful...but the taste...not sure if it was the lukewarm soup itself, the crumbled cheese, or the rock hard pieces of avocado, but it was not good.  I then ordered the Enchilada Toluca.  The menu says that there is a cream sauce, but there was definitely no sauce on this, just melted cheese on top, however I thought it was delicious, although there could have been more chorizo in the enchilada.  The rice was pretty bland, but the refried beans were wonderful.  The beans had a lot of flavor.  Overall...it wasn't the worst Mexican food I've had, but it certainly was not the best.",
