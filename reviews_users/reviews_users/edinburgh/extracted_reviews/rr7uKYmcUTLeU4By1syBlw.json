    "text": "Jashans it is you, not me. Over the last few weeks I have been making an effort to try new and different curry places, sadly this has had a knock on effect. Jashans just isn't as good as many of the options on Gorgie or Dalry road, which are both easily within walking distance and deliver to the area. I'm going to do a bit of a deconstruction, so here are the places that for me Jashans has got it wrong:  1. The takeaway set meal - normal practice, if a set meal is offered in an Indian is to provide a starter, a classic curry (the ones everyone has heard of) and some sort of rice or nan offering. This is not the case in Jashans. It is just 1 standard starter, main, side and rice + plain nan. The lack of variance means you won't take advantage of the set meal very often...  2. It is expensive. All the curry shops in the area are cheaper and most are at least as good or (more likely) better. for example 3.25 for pilau rice, one of the most expensive I have seen!  3. Still on rice, I just don't like their pilau (something in the flavour) and tried the ghee batt (3.50, for rice fried in ghee with onion) as a replacement. Sadly this was a clean white colour, that tasted a little of ghee, but didn't look fried.  Ok, that is my big three, but I have an overall sense that Jashans perhaps believe they don't need to compete, being the only Indian on Slateford Road and hey they seem to have got away with it this long. Thing is I have no issue walking an extra 10 minutes, heck it might even make the curry a bit healthier, or so I will tell myself. The curry itself is still ok, but this curry lover has found better options so I doubt I'll be back.",

    "text": "We recently moved to this part of town and are venturing to try to find our new local spots for lazy night take out. I love Indian and would argue it is something that never tastes the same at home, but my experience at Jashans made me think differently. We called on a Friday night, and granted, probably the busiest night for take-out, but there phone manor was very rushed and not very organised, as my boyfriend was passed to two different people, and then someone tried to dial out while we were on the line. They said delivery would take an hour, so we opted to collect it, as I was to hungry to wait.  We order garlic naan, butter chicken, potatoes/okra and onion bhaji. It did come well presented and neatly packed, but needless to say, the food was so disappointing. It didn't taste bad, but it certainly did not taste like Indian food. Mine was suppose to be medium, but was super oily and had no spice or real flavour to speak of. It was like tomato paste and oil had been partly mixed in, but nothing else, and the okra had no flavour. I don't eat meat, but I tried the sauce for the butter chicken and it tasted just like honey, and no spice there either. My boyfriend said the chicken tasted overcooked and he was no impressed with my dish either.   The naan was very dry and lacked any hit of garlic, which was super disappointing. The onion bhaji tasted nice, but could have been crispier. It did some with some nice sauces, but not sure what they were, some sort of mild chili sauce maybe?  Overall, it wasn't a good experience and for over 20, it definitely wasn't worth it. As nothing made an impression on us, we aren't keen to go back and give it a second chance. I read the reviews beforehand and since they are seem fairly positive I was surprised it was so far from the taste I was expecting. I would not recommend this place to anyone, and will continue my search for good take out near by.",

    "text": "I do love this place but I'm only going for 4 stars as this review is based on takeaway, not the full restaurant experience.  It has been opened now for about a year and replaced Oscars on Slateford Road. There is a restaurant which seems to do pretty good business. I popped in before 7 on a Friday for a takeaway and it was pretty full which is always a good sign, with lots of other popping in to collect takeaway too.  Their takeaways are awesome. First visit at New Years was for meal deal for 2 and we added extra bits (pakora, naan, extra rice) on to make it a meal for 3 - seriously, there was tons of food, even feeding three with pub munchies, meant there was still another meal and a bit left for another day. Meat is cooked amazingly - we had a chicken korma and there was a lamb dish with mint whose name escapes me. I would never order lamb normally and didn't intend on even trying it but it was awesome. Totally melt in the mouth gorgeousness.   I tried to look for it last night but probably missed it on the menu due to tiredness and starvation so I opted for a chicken dupiaza. It was lovely, subtly spiced tomatoey sauce with huge chunks of tender chicken and slices of red and green peppers and onions - yum! I ordered boiled rice to go with it and when I opened the bag at home, not only did I have my order, but a 2 little tubs containing a chopped onion salad and some mango chutney. I think this is a Jashans thing as there is always some kind of salad and sauce thing that comes extra which is a nice touch.   So, yep, Jashans is worth checking out. There are deals on for the restaurant on Sundays, and lunchtimes during the week,if you fancy a bargain lunch treat. The staff are lovely and the restaurant is really nicely decorated, very modern, but with lots of red, orange and gold accents to reflect the Indian and Bangladeshi theme.",

    "text": "it was sunday night, it was late, it was cold, it had been snowing on and off all weekend, neither me or my boyfriend could face cooking dinner so we decided to finally try jashans which had opened up down the street from his flat a number of months ago.  we phoned our order in and headed over to pick it up.  i was a bit shocked entering the restaurant itself, as it really rather quite posh looking.  all rich sumptious colours and dark wooden tables.  i was definitely impressed, perhaps less so when we had at least three different waiters come up to us to ask what our take away order was.  um we already ordered and we are just waiting for the food now... it also took about three attempts to pay.  about 10 minutes after our arrival though, we had paid and the food was brought to us and we hopped in the car to head home.  i unpacked the items which included poppadums, onion salad, garlic chicken, green herb chicken, saag aloo, pilau rice, and a peshwari naan.  i did like that the food came in tupperwares which meant for less chance of an accidental spillage while carrying it from car to flat, but i found that the food was barely on the hot side, more warm moving to room temperature.  to be fair the curries were perfectly nice and i really enjoyed the naan, it was lovely and coconuty and sweet but without that weird hideous orange dyed coconut colour that you usually get.  but i felt like this place fell short of the other amazing curry houses that edinburgh has to offer as i can really only describe my meal as nice and not overly memorable.  it was also a bit more expensive than i would have expected for a takeaway.  so sadly, it's only A-OK and i may encourage my boyfriend to order from a different establishment the next time we opt for an indian to take away.",
