From the naan to the entrees, everything tastes like it is treated with an exceptional amount of care and passion. The blend of spices and flavors dance across your tongue.   I was legitimately sad when the meal was over. People who live in Edinburgh don't know how lucky they are to have this because we sure don't have anything this good in Portland Oregon.",

The naan had the perfect amount of fluffiness and oil. Very good prices too, considering the location. Overall, this was a perfect meal.",

Could only image the kitchen looked knowing there was canisters of food in the halls next to chemicals outside the bathroom doors. Thankfully I didn't get sick.",

    "text": "First of all, please don't be put off by the construction outside! Shri Bheemas is up a flight of stairs, but the restaurant is spacious and the decor is lovely. I can't fault the food at all - I was there with my parents and sister for dinner, and we each chose a starter. The Punjabi samosas were excellent, stuffed full and the pastry wasn't greasy, and all of the starters were presented beautifully on their plates. We also ordered some drinks, and they happily provided an ice bucket for the bottle of white wine we shared.  The food can be ordered as a side or a main. I couldn't decide, so ordered the Bombay aloo and the channa masala as two sides and both were delicious, amazing flavour. I was very satisfied with my dinner, as was my family. We also ordered two of the garlic naan and two rice bowls. The naan in particular was amazing, and there was more than enough for the four of us, though we maybe could have done with ordering slightly more rice between us. The mains were presented as nicely as the starters, with the food brought out in pretty dishes that were great for sharing.  I really can't find fault with Shri Bheemas, the service was wonderful and the staff friendly, a lovely interior, and amazing food. Would definitely like to visit again",

The fact that it is up a flight of stairs made me a bit apprehensive - I wasn't sure how good the ambience/decor would be. Surprisingly it is a great restaurant! The staff is very helpful. The paneer tikka I had was the best I have ever eaten in my life (no exaggeration) - and I have eaten Indian food for a few decades. You have to try it to understand what paneer tikka should taste like! I also tried the Kothu Parotta. I grew up in India but had never heard of this dish - it was quite good but also very spicy. To be fair, the menu said the dish would be spicy so trust the menu. Overall, a great experience. Again, the paneer tikka is out of this world. The chef should get a nobel prize or something.",
