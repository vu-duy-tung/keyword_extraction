    "text": "I went in with a friend just after they had opened, so they were working out the kinks. We weren't expecting perfect but unfortunately there were some issues.   We were handed to different menus, one being for a midweek 2 course special, and their regular a la carte. It might of been a good idea to label the 2 course special as a tasting menu, as there was a big difference in portion sizes between the two menus.  The food was good, but only good. Stockbridge has a good selection of great restaurants already, so I hope the selection improves.  Time will tell if this restaurant lasts in the very competitive Edinburgh market.",

    "text": "A very nice, intimate, and overall excellent experience. It's a small place, dimly lit with chill music (think smokey jazz..), and a menu inspired by haute cuisine. For me, I'm glad that it wasn't haute cuisine itself, but just inspired by, because I always come away hungry from those type of places.   Had the venison with wild mushroom and butternut squash main, sea scallops with black pudding mini squares for appie, and the lemongrass pannocotta for dessert. All, very well done. Also, I should say, I'm not sure if brexit was at play here, but it was all very reasonably priced. Can't find this quality in DC anywhere near these prices. Bravo",
