    "text": "Not often I give 4 stars to a simple cafe but this was a nice place. Ambiance: Not much to speak of since it's just a basic sandwich deli in appearance. Only a few seats and generally a bit of a line so it's more take and go. Service: Plenty of staff keeps the line moving quickly. Friendly. Food: I had the Parma panini and was fresh and tasty. Just what I wanted for a quick meal with only a short break from the conference center. Price: Absolute bargain. Sandwich and a drink for under six pounds. Overall I highly recommend this place if you want a good quality sandwich, pastry or coffee while attending the conference center.",

    "text": "Pronto is becoming enough of an affectionate hangout that I was sad when they closed recently for their 'annual vacation'. A cafe that shuts down at the start of August - what?  Anyway, they serve salads, baked potatoes, stromboli and other Italian delights. With most cafes, sandwich options are not the most inspiring, but their salads are pretty good. As Lindsay O observed, not the cheapest option, but certainly I have enjoyed my lunches from there on a regular basis.",

    "text": "This was my first lunch here and I was after something different from the norm of sandwiches.  I had a veggie Stromboli which did the trick nicely, hot toasted and delicious. It was in a foil lined bag to keep it hot. The shop is clean, well presented and had a good selection. The only reason for the 4 stars not 5 is the price.  A little on the steep side that would make this place a treat not an everyday for lunch place unless you wanted to pay 6+ for your work lunch every day.  I will be back here but not every day.",
