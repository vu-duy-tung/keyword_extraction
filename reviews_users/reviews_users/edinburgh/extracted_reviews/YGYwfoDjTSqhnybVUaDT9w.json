For our main course we selected Lamb Tikka, Khushab Kharahi, with a side order of garlic naan. Both dishes were filling although lacking in flavorful spices to which I added a generous helping of salt.  Overall a great visit!",

They were very responsive via email and welcomed our large group. The restaurant is gorgeous and the food was excellent. Further more the service and presentation was top notch. I highly recommend giving them a try if you are in the mood for Indian. We tried so many wonderful things and many of the options are offered in smaller taste portions so you can really mix together a wonderful taste menu. I highly recommend this upscale hi-end restaurant.",

Perhaps the BYOB was introduced since our visit.  Interesting that there were no comments on the rest of the issues...just an attempt to discredit the review they didn't like.",
