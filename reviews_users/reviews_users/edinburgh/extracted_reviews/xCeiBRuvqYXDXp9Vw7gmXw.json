    "text": "The rain was pouring down  a typical Edinburgh Summer day. Decided to have lunch here. The first thing that surprised me was that it was quiet even when it was wet. A dark interior with a number of tables and chairs which extend into a second area to the left of the bar. I ordered a cocktail from the waiter but that did not arrive for some 10 minutes. Not a good start! I then decided to select from the lunch menu something to eat. Luckily the lunch menu was a little less expensive than the main evening menu. This does seem over-priced compared to similar food in other restaurants. There was then another long delay before my beef burger arrived. For my taste this was over-cooked as were some of the chips. I mentioned about this to the duty manager, who seemed very anxious and kept pacing up and down, however nothing happened. Finishing my meal  feeling less than happy I had a look at the whisky selection in the room next door. A good range of whiskies, but again, expensive and none at a discounted price. Overall a disappointing visit.",

Tried to get in during the Festival but never any seats as it was purley mobbed so booked instead. The decor is beautiful with lots of copper and comfy seats. Food was excellent, I had the chicken with haggis mash and creamed leeks  awesome and the other half had a fillet steak (for a change) and said it was the best he had ever eaten, which is a huge compliment. Overall would recommend and go back as had a great choice of drinks and cosktails, tasty food and had a cool atmosphere.",

    "text": "Had some friends visiting from London and I was tasked with booking us a table. My first two choices were all booked up for Saturday night (I never want my dinner as late as 9pm!) so after a browse around Yelp I settled on Whiski. Looked like I'd be able to give them a taste of some nice traditional Scottish food.  Looks very hip when you arrive - all exposed brick walls etc. While we waited for our table to be turned around we were invited to partake of a drink at the bar. I always hone in on G&T and the barman was able to talk me through their gin selection, recommending one for me with a wedge of grapefruit in it - very refreshing!  We were shown to our table, and (wisely) informed of their 2-hour turn around policy - nice to know in advance but plenty of time to eat.  All of the food was very tasty and well presented - I managed to talk both of my companions in to sampling haggis and they both enjoyed it. I went for the haddock which was delicious and meaty.  Having tried this place on a chance the gamble paid off and I'd definitely come here again. Maybe for a whisky tasting!?",

My husband and I came here twice while in Edinburgh for New Years, and each time, we sat for at least 10 minutes before we could get anyone to even bring us a menu. And then, it took at least another 10 minutes before they'd come back to take your order.  We didn't here for food, so I can't vouch fo the food. But they do have nice whiskey/scotch flights. I highly recommend the flight that allows you to taste a scotch from each region of Scotland. It's a great way to really taste and learn the differences between the various types of scotch.  If you can get a seat by the front window, especially in the winter when there are no leaves on the trees, you'll end up with a really nice view over the princes street gardens.",

We dropped in on a busy saturday night, hoping for a little calming effect before our haunted tour, and they made room for us.  Our bartender/server was great- we told him what whisky types we normally like, and he brought out a flight that was similar enough, but that let us try new types of whiskys. Super nice.

We were seated in a little secluded area at the back with a view of the bar where we could enjoy our meal in peace and quiet. The atmosphere was just right, buzzy, busy but not too loud to enjoy a chat.   Service was great, a warm welcome, friendly chat but no hovering (i see others have mentioned poor service but I can only say we certainly had no complaints). And the most important thing - the food was delicious. I had the Chicken Supreme followed by Creme Brulee while my friend opted for the Steak & Merlot pie with Chocolate Cheesecake for dessert. A nice bottle of Sauvignon Blanc - perfect.  I would definitely recommend and will be returning.",

They did however manage to squeeze us in at the bar which we were happy to. The staff are extremely knowledgeable about the Whisky's and gladly talked us through them so we could pick the flight (tasting menu) we would most enjoy. All the flights are very reasonably priced considering the quantity you get in each glass. We predominantly went in to try one of their Whisky Flights but ended up also ordering a shared charcuterie board. When it arrived it was huge, I didn't expect that sized portion for how cheap it was. Great selection of meats and the right ratio to dips and bread. Very impressed. I would definitely recommend and would come back again if I visited Edinburgh to explore what other Whisky's they have. (Visit - 31/12/2014 Lunch)",

Yes, of course the whiskey is good, but there are many places in Edinburgh with extensive selections and knowledgeable staff (duh). But, I've dined out in Paris, NYC, Tokyo and live in San Francisco- so I think I know good food when I find it. Everything we ordered here was lip-smacking, F-freakin' fantastic good. My wife ordered a cider braised pork cheek that she said was the best pork dish she's ever had. I had some hand dived Orkney Island scallops with black pudding and cauliflower 2 ways. I have to say it was one of the best appetizers I've ever had (even though the combination sounds unlikely). Dessert was also awesome, a smokey whisky cream foam with crystalized honeycomb and a raspberry reduction. Presentation for all our dishes was like a sushi bar- edible art but with hearty portions. What can I say? The Whiski Rooms knocked it out of the ballpark on both occasions- cannot recommend highly enough!",

There are actually two restaurants bearing the name \"Whiski\", the \"Whiski Rooms\" and the \"Whiski Bar and Restaurant\" - the one I'm reviewing here is \"Whiski Rooms\", with a view of the Sir Walter Scott Monument.   This is a superior bar and restaurant that serves modern interpretations of traditional Scottish dishes like haggis at slightly inflated prices, but the food is well-presented and of good quality. Service can be a teensy bit snooty, and Whiski Rooms are a busy establishment at lunch AND dinner times. So a reservation is strongly recommended to avoid disappointment.  The decor is modern-stylish and streamlined. A broad range of drinks is available, including a number of lagers and ales - and, as the name implies, lots of different single malts. Again, prices aren't the lowest.",

The whisky \"flights\" are legendary and the wait staff/bartenders are well versed in each choice - as well as when to add a drop of water or not to open up the luscious notes of each sample.  Their Cullen skink (smoked fish chowder) is the best in town. Even locals rave about their haggis \"egg roll\" appetizer. They have a creative take on traditional favorites like shepherds pie and their fish and chips (a little dry) was very tasty.  For those looking to bring a bottle of their favorite \"scotch\" whisky home, the adjoining sales shop is quite adept and helpful in wrapping.  This is a must as you will not find these selections at the duty free shop at the airport.  My appreciation also goes out to their manager who saved my butt by holding a few envelopes I carelessly left at the bar (being obviously bewildered by the selection and a tasting or two could have possibly contributed as well). They were super helpful and couldn't be nicer (thanks again).",

    "text": "Fabulous whisky and cheese tasting experience at the Whiski Rooms! Went with a few friends for a tasting event on a Saturday evening and now see this as a beautiful staple to bring any future visitors to - highly recommend a visit to this spot for any budding whisky fans!! The four whiskies provided gave us a great range of tastes, building slowly from a relatively easily drinkable whiskey from the lowlands, up through to some of the more peety/ smoky whiskies from the islands and highlands. The cheese pairings with the whiskies were delicious and incredibly well done. I'm mildly cheese obsessed, so potentially a bit biased, but beyond just giving us some great new local cheeses (highlight was one called \"old smokey\" - if you ever see this in a store, please buy it, try it, and then come back down from your visit to heaven and let me know where to find it!), each one truly did bring something wonderful and new to the whisky it was paired with!  Our guide was personable and knowledgeable - he gave us lots of information throughout the tasting but was also open and happy to answer any questions. He was unpretentious and thankfully didn't attempt to influence our tasting by saying things like \"you'll get notes of cinnamon on the nose, and honeysuckle on the palette\" - he simply guided us through the process of drinking whisky, allowing us to get the most from the experience, reminding us throughout that each of us is different, and as such will experience each whisky differently.  I went to this tasting event with three friends, and we went through the experience with around 12 other people at a long beautiful wood table. I loved that the decor and vibe of the place was very much in keeping with the whisky culture. A few of those I was with had been to the Whisky Experience previously (another whisky tour option in Edinburgh), and mentioned that the Whiski Rooms tasting was far better done, so go for this one if given the choice!  Note that I didn't eat here so can't say anything regarding the food - this rating is solely in regards to their whisky and cheese tasting events (which are offered regularly).  The whole tasting cost all of about 25, which I can happily say was beyond worth it. You also get 5 off any bottle purchase afterwards (which they fortunately don't push you at all into using - they're all happy to help but not aggressive salesmen!). You could look at it from the perspective of \"I could get a lot more than 4 drams of whisky and 8 hunks of cheese for that kind of money,\" but I promise it's worth it - you'll never drink whisky the same way again after this tasting!!",

That was the first thing to slip... time - while we had over an hour to eat, we had to rush eating by the time the food finally showed up and the SR actually had to pay the bill while I finished up.   The SR went for the burger, the Venerable Nephew selected haggis (while in Scotland...), and I opted for the vegetarian version. Bless the VN's description of his meal, that 'looked as if it was doused with hay' (that would be leeks). Sadly, it was a disappointment across the board - bland haggis, underseasoned potato, a very peaty whisky sauce that was super 'loud' compared to the rest of the meal. At least the sauce came on the side and you could pick how much you wanted (ordrown your plate, as my VN did.... oops). Others do it better, sadly. Wait staff were perfectly pleasant, though.",

Haggis, of course, with nips and potatoes.  I found the Haggis a little dry but the addition of the sauce made it better.  Knowing what it is made off, I didn't find it very interesting.   Potatoes and nips were carbs and were ok.  I prefer rice as my carb of choice.  This is a great place to try some whiskey flights.  Of the 9 different flights available, I tried the flight of island malts.   It included: Arran 10 yr jura superstition Talisker 10 yr Letang 10 yr A pipette with water is also provided.  Great way try it neat before adding a couple of drops of water to ser how the taste changes. I enjoyed all four.  I would have gotten another flight if I did not have to get up early the next morning.   For dessert, a plate of four different domestic cheeses.  All were incredible.   A great place for dinner not far from the the castle or train station.  Nice thing I noticed was it was not all tourist here, I noticed some locals having a nice night out.  Service was good with a nice relaxing atmosphere.  I would definitely recommend reservations here especially Friday and Saturday night.",

After eating and shopping my friend and I decided to get something to drink but every bar we popped into was jammed pack. There wasn't an empty seat to be found. We left the popular parts and headed down a few alleys and narrow side streets until we ended up here. It was perfect!   Now I think I missed something when I first entered because I saw a waitress serve a table so I just assumed there were people taking orders. We sat ourselves and then waited and waited. After awhile I went up to the bar and ordered there. The bartender was super friendly and didn't seem surprised I ordered there so perhaps that was the expectation. I ended up having a couple different whisky cocktails while my friend ordered a whisky flight. I also ordered cranachan from the dessert menu.   I have never heard of this dessert but it was incredibly delicious! Raspberries, honey, cream, oatmeal, and whisky combined to make a fantastic sweet combination! I was thrilled!   It was a great spot!",

We had a dessert to go with it and found the whole thing a very pleasant experience.

You're in scotland, you want to drink whisky, well, this place has buckets of it (which by the name, would be very disappointing if they didn't!)  Although pretty full, we couldn't resist nibble of plump juicy olives and lovey cheeses (whisky and cheese tasting is a thing here too)  And we had a relaxed few, whisky based cocktails, and the good stuff solo, which, if you don;t know your stuff, the bar staff certainly do, and will happily advise. Dimly lit, with lights and candles, everything in the place was comfortable and lovely (apart from the freezing draft from the door on a snowy night!)  Would love to come back here and sample the food.",

The only food we managed to shovel in was olives in oil (after a second whiskey flight). The staff was very informative and friendly. I believe the bartender referred to my mother and I as drunkards, which was taken as a compliment, naturally. If you're not a whiskey connoisseur, you must try it with and without the droplets of water. It makes a surprising difference. I do hope to visit again soon! Love, the younger drunkard.",

There are three main areas to the WHISKI Rooms - store, bar and restaurant. We sat in the restaurant portion. The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable about whisky.   We started with the loaf of bread. It came with a olive tapenade and oil & balsamic mix. The loaf was very good - warm and fresh, but a bit overpriced (5.50). I ordered a pint of the Innis & Gunn - Session IPA and the Ribeye. The ribeye was very good \"Our Steaks are Scotch beef, grass fed and matured for 35 days.\" It was definitely a solid piece of beef. The ribeye was cooked to a nice medium rare. The chips were really good - better than any I had in London. With the wealth of restaurants on the Royal Mile, I think it's worth the few minutes to give WHISKI Rooms a try.",

Prices are on par with most of the shops in the touristy section of town.  The main bar is a good time too. A ton of selections, beer + whisky combos, daily specials, and of course, FLIGHTS! I did Flight #9 (The Islands) and it was a great introduction to whiskies we don't have back home in the States. I ended up buying a bottle of Jura to bring back home with me based on my experience here.  Staff is friendly, there's a ton of seating (it's two bar spaces, basically), and they also serve food (though we didn't have any).  We actually ended our trip by going back to WHISKI Rooms for another pint and a pour because it was so great.",
