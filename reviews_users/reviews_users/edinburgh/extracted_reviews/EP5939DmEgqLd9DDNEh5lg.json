    "text": "We booked here with a group of 9 at the end of the Festival in August. As all the restaurants in town were fully booked, we ventured to Leith. The restaurant was pretty full, and there was a good atmosphere. There were a lot of staff on, but at the same time, we didn't see a lot of them. We had to wait quite a while for a waiter to take our drink orders, and again quite a while for someone to take our food orders. The food was delicious, and everyone got theirs at the same time. The downside of it was, that it took 45 minutes to an hour for our starters to be put on the table. To kill the time, we got some poppadums without dip, not very tasty.When our starters hadn't arrived after 45 minutes, I asked if one of the waiters if he was sure our order had reached the kitchen, and he just said 'yes', without an apology for the delay. After our variety of tasty starts, with a sad side salad, had arrived - again it took a good while for the mains to arrive. The food was very flavoursome, and there is a lot of choice on the menu. I don't know if I was there on a bad day, and they just didn't have enough kitchen staff, but nonetheless, more attention from the waiting staff would have been nice. I might go back for a takeaway, but not for another meal.",

    "text": "Ok, this is a rant, but I feel I'm entitled to it! The food is generally great which is why I kept going back, but I have now reached the end of my tether! 5 out of 6 times in the last couple of months they have mucked up my takeaway/delivery!! They've let my parents, my friends and I down several times in the past also. For example missing drinks, dishes, rice, cold meals/breads, 2hour delivery times when quoting just over an hour and even forgetting to put vegetables in a chicken korma!! If you eat in, or actually collect and double check your order then I can recommend them, but I do not recommend relying on them for delivery!",

    "text": "This place has gone downhill. Smaller portions with less meat and has there been a price increase? Overall I get the impression they are busier generally and are trying to cash in on this. Food still tastes good though. The guy in charge on the floor however needs a few lessons in customer service, or a smile at least!",
