The bar has not changed so it is still a bit on the small side and can get extremely busy at times, especially in good weather, possibly more so now there is room for more bar customers.",

Like its sister establishment on William Street (simply Teuchters) there is a restaurant attached (A Room In Leith).

    "text": "a rainy and cold wednesday night saw me wandering to teuchters landing to have a few festive drinks with some friends (who also happen to be some of the most lovely people i know).  while i huddled under my rather broken umbrella and hurried into the doors, i was greeted with a warm cosy welcome from the warmth of a fire and friendly bar staff.    being the first to arrive, shortly followed by the second person we ordered some beers and sat down at the reserved table.  it was in the corner of the back room, but right next to the fire which made it super warm (a plus for me as i absolutely hate being cold when i'm at a restaurant).  our group of friends tricked in rather quickly after that and soon we were all sat around with drinks and perusing the mug menu for food.  now this pub does three things right, it's warm, it has a massive selection of beers and whiskey (you can get a hot toddy, how awesome is that??!!), and it serves you food in big mugs that adds to its cosy charm.  and the food, mmmmmmm.  i went for a pork and venison sausage in a hot dog roll and a mug of chips.  i had a wee debate over the small or large mug but the bartender convinced me to go small as the large is literally a pint sized mug full of chips!  i was quite glad for the small mug as the portion was just the perfect size to go with my hot dog.  now maybe this wasn't a gourmet hot dog, but it was super tasty and just what you want on a cold rainy night.  the chips were lovely and hand cut and seasoned and crisp and i enjoyed every last one!  i definitely like this place, but i debate if i like it more because i had such a lovely evening laughing and catching up with friends.  and we did a lot of laughing, maybe a bit loudly for other tables but the staff never asked us to keep it down and even joined in on one of the jokes.  so this is a perfect venue if you're part of a group that may be of the louder variety.    hmm so yes, teuchters landing i like you and i like that you are near my flat and you have a fire place with a real fire!  i like that you serve my food in a mug and make me a hot toddy and enjoy a good laugh with your customers.  i'm looking forward to going back already.",

    "text": "The bar is rather small and outrageously cosy. Fire going, dimmed lighting, leather furnishings and an oak finish. Like it. For me it's 30min on the bus but still worth the travel. Not the least for their whisky selection. A good few malts they've got there on a blackboard. We had to climb to our tiptoes and squint to read it though, it's hung just below the ceiling.   It's far from everywhere major but that means you get a table. No crowds. They serve nice, hearty food. Homemade steak casserole is highly recommended. Apart from whisky they also have some good beers and lagers (we had a cheeky pint of the original Czech Budweiser to finish the whisky evening off) and, apparently, wide range of wines.   If you want more details on their whisky selection you will find it here: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.edinburghwhiskyblog.com&s=5312952fc8609b4bbc8eba2e64acd3fa02f4c13d35d6e1f535b9e08bb8b018f0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">edinburghwhiskyblog.com</a>",

    "text": "A cracking restaurant and bar with a fine atmosphere and food that hits the mark!  Six of us sat down for dinner, starting by sharing a couple of dishes to whet our appetites... the Stornoway black pudding scotch egg and Sparl Brae Shetland blue shell mussels mariniere both hit the spot perfectly!  Fish is a particular strength of this restaurant... I went for the monkfish, while my wife had the sea trout... neither of us were disappointed in the slightest! There is also plenty on offer for those not in the mood for fish... one of my sisters had the mixed pork grill and another had the pan roasted chicken breast... again they were both delighted with their food.  The presentation and flavours are perfect... not too pretentious, but several steps above the vast majority of eateries.  As a restarant with a bar the choice of drinks is very good - a comprehensive wine list and a fair number of real ales on tap... and not just the usual staples... guest ales feature well and complement the food on offer nicely.  The only downside was that despite sharing only two starters amongst the six of us, nobody was able to stretch to having a pudding... although admittedly we were returning home to have birthday cake!",

You can eat in the long light restaurant looking out over the water of Leith or if the weather allows you can eat out on the floating dock at the back of the restaurant.   The food is well cooked and well presented with lots of choice and is reasonably priced for the standard of the food.   The bar is also nice and cosy - very traditional old style bar.",

However if coming here, you come for the whisky and novel selection method on hand if you so wish. Fairground style hoopla, cheapest price with chance to drink the priciest whisky. Bar staff are usually friendly, knowledgeable and helpful and will find you something you like regardless of your tastes.  Food is a good pick, served in pint mugs if you opt in, good hearty grub with a new special on most days.  If in the area well worth going off the track to try this place out and take in the waterside seating if the weather is good out on the pontoon into the water of leith.",

WHERE THEY HAVE WON; - Mugs of curry, stew, mac 'n' cheese, etc. All great ideas and an innovative way to serve. - The Man v Food Belly buster Burger; massive patty, haggis, bacon, cheddar, pulled pork. An excellent piece of cooking served on a lovely soft large roll, as opposed to a bap, which again compliments it well. Definitely one for BURGER WATCH consideration. - Sheep Dip Hoopla. You pay 3.70 and are handed the hoop. If you can get round one of the whiskies behind the bar you win a dram of said whisky; if more than one, you get your choice of the ones you hoop; if you miss on all three goes, you get the Sheep Dip, which isn't a consolation! Good bit of fun. especially if you get one of the more expensive ones.  WHERE THEY HAVE NOT; - Prices seem a bit marked up. George Street this place is not, so stop charging as if you are. - Communication. I don't frequent the bar often, and saw on more than one occasion, someone being served at the end opening of the bar. I then stood and waited 5 mins, watching several folk come and go after me. Was only when I ASKED if this was a no service point that I was duly advised to go round the bar.... after several staff clearly seeing me stood there waiting. And I didn't bother getting into the argument of why others got the special treatment.  All in all, still middle of the road for me. Seating is a bit all over the place and I never really feel like I can get comfy, but the place has character which makes me wish the above problems weren't problems. Still....",

Teuchters Landing has managed to win me over mostly based on their location. I am not too keen on the furniture inside, but then again I never much spend inside.  A nice touch over the summer was the free use of suncream on the bar. As the place is a sun trap!   OK the bar itself. They have whisky - loads of it.  - Too many to name, but to help out they have a whiskey menu list. Which is very informative and invites you to try not just one, two, but many, many more than you originally intended.. or was that just me?   Beside the wonderful selection of whisky, they have a full bar with Scottish brewers on tap / bottle and your usual suspects from known breweries.  The wine list is short (compared tot the whisky list) but has some nice ones on it.   The staff has always been cheerful, efficient and very helpful on my visits and I can compliment them for doing a nice job.  I did not have the food, but the summer menu looked appetising and seasonal.   Their biggest attraction for me is the outside 'floating terrace' overlooking the Leith Shore area. You can be assured of a tan after spending an afternoon in that spot - which sometimes has table service.   I recommend this bar for summer. Why don't I like this in winter? Because I like to be on a terrace and I don't like the inside so much that is why.",

This is a great pub, with very good staff, it's in a great part of leith, and serves as a great stop off from one end of leith to the other. The location is just one of many positives about this place.  The beer selection is exemplary, a few permanent fixtures include personal favourites Jarl by Fyne Ales, Ossian by Inveralmond and one of the best beer moves ever, they recently kicked out Brewdog's Punk IPA and brought in Cromarty's Red Rocker which was my Beer of 2012!  They do a nice bar food menu where everything is served in Mugs. Macaroni cheese, Haggis Stovies and Lamb Stew all help you to balance out the efffects of their fine beverage offerings. A very good selection of wines and also a good range of whiskies, all further serve to prove that the guys involved here really out some thought into what they are doing.  Open fires and a big screen TV for the big sporting events make this arguably the best pub in leith...  I only have this 4 stars as there is something missing, I still don't know what it is... Maybe you can tell me?",

The bar also does a range of food, but if it's a proper meal you're after you need to go next door to the restaurant 'A Room in Leith' for some of their delicious courses.  I love hanging out in Teuchter's Landing with my girlfriend, it's becoming a bit of a regular haunt for us, mostly because of the chilled out and grown up atmosphere, but also because of the fun board games. Currently i'm the reigning battleships champion, however I lost my connect 4 crown after a bottle of wine and a whisky.  The quality of the food served is mostly very good but not everything is a winner.",

    "text": "A really enjoyable lunch was had here, plated up in two mugs (of all things!). The pub offers a great selection of food measured out in mugfuls, so I opted for a small mug of lamb stew and a small mug of chips.   I was ticked to receive my lunch in said mugs and tucked in quite happily. The lamb stew was absolutely amazing - I will be back to eat this again. Chips were seasoned perfectly, crispy and came with brown, tomato and mayo sauces.   One thing to point out is that I was torn between mug sizes - the small looks awfully wee and the big looks do-able. Unless you are a ravenous individual I'd go for two small mugs (main and side); they filled me up on the good side of full and are considerably cheaper than the large options.   The pub itself has a cosy, family feel to it. It's quite snug, so if it gets busy it will be hard to sit down. Sprogs and dogs were equally happily catered for, and it's right on the Water of Leith so quite a pretty location too. Plus, there's a roaring fire. I was snug as a bug in a rug with my mug.",

The bar has lots of little nooks and crannies, and whether on a bright spring day where you can sit by the water, or a cold winter evening cosied up to the fire, it really is the perfect place to stop for a pint!  They have a great selection of beers, wines and spirits and also have a wonderful 'mug' menu for food! Definitely easier to serve mugs than plates...and they do small and large size mugs too! (macaroni, cullen skink, chips etc.)  Stepping through to the back of the pub you enter into the 'Room at the Shore' Restaurant. The food here is delicious, good value and they have a pontoon on the water you can have lunch on (gorgeous as long as it doesn't rain!)  If you're out walking the Water of Leith, or just having a dander around the Shore, make sure you pay it a visit!",

It's a bit of a trek to get to it but once there I found it hard to leave and happily ignored our increasing bar tab while flicking through the Saturday papers and making the most of the free wi-fi.  Our table was next to the fire in the front room and as the place started to fill I realised our little corner was prime pub real estate. When we eventually wobbled out, there was a mad rush from all corners to nab it.  Food-wise we had the fish curry and the hotdog with a side of fries. The curry and fries were offered in two portion sizes - small mug or big mug - and I opted to go large for both which turned out to be a bit much for lunch. The small mug looked just a tad small though.  The hotdog was an artisany type venison number and came in a bun that could have been made to measure.  Lesson to be learned here Ikea! No embarrassing protrusions to be found at either end!  Staff were really nice and added to the sense of a well run and welcoming local.   This pub is dog friendly (to friendly dogs) and while we were there they managed to accommodate quite a few furry little friends. I'm a huge fan of this kind of accessible laid back approach but it might not be everyone's cup of tea.  Well worth a return visit.",

    "text": "I was slightly confused by A Room in Leith. They seem to have some weird Inception style of dining, a restaurant within a restaurant where you're not actually sure whether you're in Teuchters Landing or A Room in Leith. (Or if like me and you haven't been in Leith in ages you'll also be wondering where the hell the Waterfront Bar went.) We suffered this confusion before we'd even set foot in the building as we peered at the menus outside trying to figure out why they had 2 separate menus...never mind, we got there in the end!   The bizarre March psudo-summer had driven us down to the Shore in search of some seafood. The conservatory area at the back which is 'A Room in Leith' was a perfect place to enjoy the sunshine without being caught in a cool breeze as the evening drew in.   I love mussels, which is why I was so pleased to see them offered as a starter, problem is the half pot offered as its smallest portion was just way too much for one person. My dining companion had decided on a black pudding scotch egg so I was my own. I managed to make it through the whole pot, the mariniere sauce was divine, but I was totally stuffed after! If I'd know how big the pot was going to be I would have asked for a bit more of a break between courses. I was really disappointed that I only managed to finish half of my haddock and chips as it was so tasty. The fish batter was so thick it was both crispy and spongy at the same time and the chunky cut chips complimented a really beautiful flaky piece of fish.    I kind of wish I'd asked for a doggy bag now, it feels criminal to have let any of that delicious food go to waste.",

On sunny days they have a great outdoor seating area where you can soak up the rays, and on the other 350 days a year they have a cozy fire inside to warm your bones.  Also in the bone-warming category is the gorgeous and impressive wall of spirits and the wide selection of whisky.    Their food, as another reviewer has said, is served in mugs.  I thoroughly enjoyed my haggis stovies and my guy LOVED his cullen skink.  I'm not usually one for oat cakes but we received a few to go with our food and man were they tasty.  I wasn't actually completely thrilled with our chips because I felt they needed a bit more seasoning, but oh well.    I just really like the feeling of this place, and every time I go here I take a look at the beautiful restaurant attached and think about how I seriously need to go there for a meal some day.

They have GLUTEN FREE fish and chips!! This was seriously the only place we had f&c during our two week long trip to Scotland and it they were awesome. Looking around it seems like their mug meals were very popular, but we were very hungry so opted for the ground beef chili nachos in addition to the fish and chips.

Again, due to my allergy, I ordered just the patty of a hamburger as well as the chips - yet still my plate cost 11.25. I thought that this could have been reduced a bit due to the fact I did not eat any of the toppings, bun, or seasonings that typically come on a dish.

For us, I'll admit that trek was 2 blocks, but I can only imagine I'd traverse longer distances as well to visit here.  When we entered the pub at around 7 or 8 pm, there wasn't a single table available! Patience is a virtue though, and our patience of 2 minutes resulted in a table opening. There are food menus at the tables that you can look at before ordering at the bar, as well as a list of their whiskies.  I got a small curry and did a tasting flight of whisky. The curry came in a cup and the small was a good size for dinner. The whisky flight was perfectly curated and a great selection for the price. If you don't want to order a flight or you have no idea what whisky you want to drink, you can always ask the bartenders for help or throw the ring (which I didn't try and thus have very little context on).  The ambiance was super casual and it seemed like most people in the place were locals grabbing a bite to eat after work or catching up with friends. If you want a low-key, local experience in Edinburgh, I could not recommend this place enough.",

    "text": "What a place! Using Yelp as my trusty guide, my boyfriend and I took a stroll to Leith on a rainy Friday afternoon and took solace in Teuchters Landing for a warm by the fire and a pint in the hand.   Normally once you've seen pictures of a place on Yelp, you feel like you know what to expect when entering a new place. Not here. Tiny snug rooms fit together, with real fires in many of them to keep you feeling extra cosy. It's also quite tardis-like, and from the outside looks abit like a village hall, but when entering, there's actually lots of room for people to have large groups...but you'll have to get there early, as it fills up pretty quickly!   A great selection of beers and whiskeys, and a lovely welcome from the staff as you enter. All round a top pub, the only reason why it doesn't get the full 5 stars is my personal preference of cider. Lots of choice on the fruity choice, but I do love a scrumpy on tap, and the only thing available was a stowford.   Don't let his put you off though, thoroughly recommend this place to anyone wanting somewhere cosy to pass any an afternoon.",

The helpful bartenders gave me suggestions for a terrific scotch whiskey flight. I had the tasty lamb stew for dinner. Stayed around for after dinner stout. Lovely experience!",

Good menu, vegetarians are well taken care of, and while it was busy, service was fast and friendly, and it wasn't too noisy.  Definitely worth a return trip :)",

They have a large gin selection, good beers on tap and although I didn't have food there, looking from what other tables had ordered it looked pretty tempting. I have only given this place 4 stars as it was a brief visit so I can't truly assess this place until I come back (this will definitely be a pub I want to visit again).",

Great staff, amazing whiskey selection, friendly vibe, multiple seating areas to allow you the setting that best fits your mood. And to top it off - the best battered fish and chips I have ever tasted. Seriously. I refused to eat that dish again anywhere in Edinburgh for the rest of my trip because I knew I'd just be annoyed.   Prices were reasonable. The crowd was welcoming. And there were board games. Bonus!  I was guided here by a local who overheard me on the bus talking about the place I was planning to eat. He stopped me and my companion and led us right here instead. I owe that man a drink!  (Be sure to toss the ring. Sheep Deep whisky is actually quite good as a consolation prize.)",

The food was pleasantly excellent and the whole meal was top notch. Duck Terrine, Braised Beef and then a cracking xmas pud topped it off.   A really nice meal and would expect it be be the same if not better when it's the usual menu and not a large xmas party. Really small, local, Scottish feel about the place and no pretentious decor. Just a really nice vibe and great location.",
