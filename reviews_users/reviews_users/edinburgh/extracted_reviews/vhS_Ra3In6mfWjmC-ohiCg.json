We are leaving stuffed with delicious, fresh made hummus, perfectly grilled and dressed halloumi and two lunch wraps. My husband and had the lamb wrap and I had the falafel. Both were delicious. I loved both, but since I was in the mood for something vegetarian, the falafel, roasted eggplant, roasted red pepper and hummus wrap was perfection. I can't believe this is a 5 takeaway option - I would be here every day!",

We had the lentil soup, the tzatziki, the hummus, and the sauteed chicken with mozzarella and a red sauce. Every dish was tastefully prepared and delicious right down to the garnish, and the staff were kind enough to accommodate our special request. I especially appreciate that the kitchen shows restraint in the ingredients they use; no dish had too much of a seasoning or too little, so it is clear that they are not hiding behind their sauces or garnishes. The atmosphere and location are enjoyable as well - a lively scene without it being too loud or obnoxious, and it was a pleasure to sit out on the little patio. We dined at an off peak hour, so we were able to be seated right away and did not experience any undue delays at any point during the experience. I would definitely dine here again in the future if I am fortunate enough to visit Edinburgh a second time.",

    "text": "Popped in here for dinner on a whim as Sarah had a voucher. We called to check they could accommodate two in the 30 mins it would take us to walk there and they said no problem.  The restaurant is quite small, so we had to mill around just inside the door while they got a table set up. There seemed to be some confusion about where they wanted to seat us. We were given menus straight away after we were seated and they explained that seafood & steak would incur a surcharge. All fine.  It's quite a large menu and many things looked good, so it took us quite some time to decide, although they seemed in no hurry to take our order. Once we got their attention and put in our order, it took a while for our wines to be brought over though our starters followed pretty soon after. We also got a basket of pita bread for snacking on.  There was a good break between our plates being cleared and our mains arriving. I went for one of their signature dishes, essentially a lamb stew, it was served with a side of rice and some salad. My chicken wings and main were both really tasty, and although the portions felt a little small, I didn't leave hungry, so can't really complain. I could definitely have fit in dessert, although there wasn't any on the menu (that I remember) and we weren't offered a dessert menu (but we also didn't ask for one).  The tables are very close together, so I had to squeeze myself past two guys having their dinner to leave. The decor is quite strange, retro coca cola ad posters and Turkish lamps!  All in all, the food was good. Especially good value on a voucher. Service was a bit patchy, we also had to ask for water. I'd happily pop back for a casual dinner if I was around Rose Street though probably wouldn't make a point of going especially.",
