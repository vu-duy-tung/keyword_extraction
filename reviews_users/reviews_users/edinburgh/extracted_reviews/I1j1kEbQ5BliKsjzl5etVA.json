It doesn't look muh from the outside but inside is like a step back in time and wonderful atmosphere especially on a winter's night when all the candles are lit. The only drawbacks are that at peak times you can be waiting in excess of 40 mins for your food and their specials never include veggie options but with an amazing veggie risottothat hits the spot every time, who would want to branch out?!!",

Kings Wark has solidly taken up the mantel, you know its going to be worthwhile when you walk in at 2pm and they are still only serving breaky!  Me and my fellow hangoveree took refuge at a corner table and nursed our fresh orange while perusing the menu!! My first thought was fry up but after reading the menu I was lead to the french roast withy bacon and syrup.  Now all I can say it that it delivered, I mean its french toast so your are fairly limited with where you can go with it but it ticket all the boxes. For me that means plenty of everything, I hate a syrup scrooge!!!  Looking at the menu it pretty much covers all the bases if I was going to have a moan Ild say i would like to see eggs benedict on there but thats just cause its my favourite!!  In an oober hungover state we were also delighted to see a large free portion of toast and butter brought to us while we waited!!  All in all great! Jd = happy man!",

We came here for lunch with a local friend who recommended it. There is a restaurant section and a pub section, the pub welcoming with its dark oak and cosy nooks, the restaurant stylish with a whitewashed, modern look. We picked the pub section.   The menu may not be huge but it is imaginative. I was impressed not only that they had two vegetarian options but also as to the originality of the one I chose - Gruth Dhu (Scottish cheese), spinach and butternut squash strudel with cherry tomatoes, broccoli and mixed salad.   The strudel was excellent, as were my friends' fish risotto, seafood chowder and smoked herring, all of which were beautifully presented in perfect sized portions.   If I lived in Edinburgh, I would visit this place again and again - as my local friends do - and I can't wait to be back up there again!",

WTF. all cheese works on steak in my book.  the second time i went was with about 5 others and i will give them a bit of credit as we were came a bit late for breakfast. they were out of nearly everything!!!! no shit. everything that was asked for they were out of. they did have the bagel and salmon. it was a sad pititful little bagel that i wanted to throw a life jacket around and give mouth to mouth to after before offering a new life with a family whow would love and cherish it.  hope dianna wasnt our server cause whoever we had (this was the second week of september, 2008) was HORRIBLE. we had to practically reenact the sesame street \"agua\" \"agua\" 80's skit with the guy crawling through the desert just to get a glass of water. ages to get the bill and by that time we were the only ones there.  SUCKO SUCK SUCK MCGEE. you are surrounded by wayyyy better places to eat and drink. shit, id even eat at the waterline 100 feet away before this place",

    "text": "Ok, so I'm not exactly an impartial reviewer as I worked here for 6 months, but as an American, I feel that I can give a pretty good run down of this place.  If you want authentic, cheap, and fantastic Scottish fare, this is the place - period.  On one side, there's a bar, and on the other, a restaurant.  The former is 'typical' bar food - fish and chips (I've heard it called the best in Edinburgh, and I wouldn't disagree), haggis neeps and tatties (NOT as scary as it sounds, eat this if its cold outside and you're starving - not for the merely peckish), mussels and fries, steak, seafood chowder (a must), and fresh daily fish specials.  Be aware, however, that this area is bar service only, so if you sit and wait at your table, you're not going to be served.  The other section is the a la carte menu, which means full service.  This is a fantastic menu, and it changes almost weekly.  Trust me, your taste buds will never be the same.  Nothing in this place is frozen, except for the ice cream and occasional sorbet, so expect extremely high quality food.  If you don't get it, say something - the staff is very proud of the place, and they want you to leave thinking that the King's Wark is the best place ever.    A few tips, though.  Sunday from 11 to 3 they only serve breakfast, so don't come in expecting lunch.  If you fancy it though, try it - but make sure that you make a reservation.  If you don't, there's a very real possibility that you won't get to eat - it's packed every week.  Kids are welcome during the lunch shift (12-3, and a reduced menu 3-5), and before 8 in the resaurant (dinner starts at 6), but the King's Wark is first and foremost a pub, and although it has a low key atmosphere that's ok for kids, there are laws that must abided.  Also, it is wheelchair accessible, but because of the historical status of the building, the bathrooms can't be remodeled for they are not.    The bar has 3 Scottish cask ales on draught.  Try at least one.  Also try a whisky.  And then some more food.  I can't really recommend this place enough, really.  Plus, it has accolades!  Best Scottish Pub 2008 AND it's featured in Diana Henry's Gastropub Cookbook (2008) as only 1 of 2 Scottish pubs.  Cheers!",

Apparently there are different menus, but not fully sure. Went for dinner one evening, but it was full and there was a long line of people waiting for a table, so decided to come back a couple days later. Even on a Monday evening, we had to wait a bit for a table. But, I will have to say, the food more than makes up for the wait! They serve what I would consider \"posh\" pub food at very unposh prices (starters around 3-4 and mains 8-10). If you are looking for some good food and great prices, this is the place to go.",

Its decor is simple but appealing, with wooden tables and dripping candles adding to the pirate tavern feel. The food is pricier than at the other local pubs, and the menu is short and sweet, but if you're looking for more gourmet pub grub then this is the place for you. The staff are friendly and casually dressed and the pub is inviting and warm, making it an ideal place for a winter retreat where you can get good but unpretentious food and service.",

Many generations of my family hail from Leith (my grand father was a Lindsay and his mother was a Leith), so spending a few days here was truly special. I was told to find this pub, as the property had some connection to my family (the details are a bit fuzzy... I should have paid more attention when my grandparents explained the association). We found it easily - almost by accident. It was just what I had pictured.  The building itself is very old - goes back hundreds of years.  The pub has two very, very small rooms, one for eating and drinking and another for drinking and darts.  Intimate (shoulder-to-shoulder) seating.  Brick walls.  Low ceiling.  Even a small fireplace at one end of the room we were in. We ordered fish, which was quite good. Seemed the safest thing on the menu [well, chalk board behind the bar] for a not so adventurous American. (Folks sitting next to us had haggis... I had to avert my eyes while they ate!) I don't know if this pub is normally frequented by tourists, but we were the only non-locals in the room the night we were there, which certainly added to the charm.  The atmosphere was relaxed and encouraged lingering... which we did. We whiled away the entire evening in fact, my hubby hefting pints of ale while I became acquainted with Balvenie - a single malt scotch whisky which is now my favorite. And our tab for the entire evening was under 30 pounds! Amazing. Our visit to Kings Wark is one of my favorite memories of our two weeks in GB. I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Edinburgh/Leith.",

We came here to celebrate a birthday so we chose somewhere that has hearty food and wouldn't be too expensive as there were 12 of us in all.   When we arrived it reminded me straight away of a proper, family pub back home! This in turn put me right in the mood for some mussels (Pavlovian response!) and wasn't I lucky that they were on the menu! The rest of the menu was fantastic, from poussin to pork chop, fish to hare, an amazing selection. Everything looked so good we took ages to decide. I went with the mussels to start, natch, and followed it up with a pulled pork and apple sausage.  The mussels were delicious, in a white wine and cream sauce. It was quite a bowlful and I was surprised as it was a big starter. not complaining though! The pulled pork and apple sausage was lovely. Served with black pudding, champ and (be still my beating heart) crackling! They were big portions and by the end I was too stuffed for dessert, which is probably the second time in my life that happened so bravo to The King's Wark! I tried some of the hare from the plates around me and it was cooked deliciously, though I'm not sure hare is my thing so I'm glad I didn't order it for the novelty.  I plan to bring my parents here next time they're over. They won't come to The Dogs as it's too 'young' for them, apparently, but they'll definitely come here and the menu is similar.",

    "text": "I have been to The King's Wark once before, in December, and the party of 3 of us had an enjoyable meal. Food was great, atmosphere great, good service - so I was looking forward to my next visit.  Wednesday evening - is it the new 'little Saturday'? It was surprisingly busy, but luckily my husband had reserved a table. Hmm.. the only table they had happened to be just near the entrance, so every time somebody came in there was a strong gust of wind and the poor candle on our table blew out (twice). My friend sat with her coat on the whole time!  I asked if we could maybe move to a different table, but I was told that there were other people queuing for tables. Fair enough.  King's Wark always have daily specials (fish and seafood). I was trying to decide between wild grilled trout and pheasant - I chose the latter.  Oh, I should have maybe gone for the trout.. The dish arrived eventually and it came with gnocchi, beetroot jelly and winter greens. Gnocchi was delicious, I think it was the best part of the meal. Beetroot jelly didn't really do much to the dish, rather than adding a little bit of colour.  The pheasant unfortunately was chewy and tough - disappointing. I didn't finish it, as it just wasn't pleasant to eat. Also it didn't have much flavour.   I'm not much of a complainer (except on Yelp) so I thought that once they come to clear up the plates, I will let them know about the pheasant. However, busy as they were - this never happened. Nobody came to ask how the meal was.   We paid and left.   I'm still convinced that King's Wark offers great food. This was perhaps just a unexpectedly busy evening. I am hoping that my next visit will bump up the score to at least 3 stars or more :)",

    "text": "Seems there is a pattern of people feeling cold in that pub. Either the heating is on low, the entrance \"doors\" inconveniently placed or just poor ignorance to their customer needs. People sitting near the doors can feel inflicted by cold air that comes blowing in. I can imagine that if there should be gales you could be blown out the back entrance!  It happened to me. I was not able to lay down my coat. It was too cold. Before I went there for the first time in my life this week, people told me that this is a really nice place to experience good food and a nice fire place atmosphere. None was True. Yes, there is a nice fireplace in the back of the room, but it provides little substitute to the icy wind that sweeps the place.  About the service:  It was a weekday and the service was slow. It took them a while to take the order. It took them a while to serve the drinks and the food. And it took them \"never\" to ask us if we wanted dessert or coffee or the bill. Thinking back, they might have not noticed if we would have left without paying! For some people definitely a good thing ;-)   About the food:  The pheasant was dry and chewy. The bread pieces were not enough for 3 people (I think they mixed up the tables) and were dry. The best part was the Gnocchi. Overall the food was not worth the money. The menu promised an a la cart dinner and the prices reflected the offer. The food might look good on paper, but I believe that the cook had a bad day!  Good luck next time, if........!",

My party of 8 walked in (4 adults, 4 kids all under 10) around 7-7:30 and were happily seated right near the front window with twinkle lights aglow.  Low ceilings, big beams, dark bar in the other room - this was a pub I'd happily spend all evening in (with out my kids).   While they did not have a kids menu (not surprising) all our li'l boys found something delicious.  They were happy to make smaller portions of regular dishes.  My 7-year-old said his burger was the best he'd had the whole trip (we'd been traveling for about a week and a half at this point).   My husband had the hagis, which I tried for the first time, and raved about it!  I started with the cream of mushroom soup and wish the bowl had been bigger (it was actually quite a good size) - so delish!  For my entree I had the fish 'n chips to which I will quote my son, \"This is freakin' awesome.\"  Best I'd had in Britain.   There was some disappointment that they were out of mussels, but what we had was absolutely wonderful.  The staff was friendly and quite accommodating for the large group.  We left Scotland after just 4 days and The King's Wark was our stand out meal.",

The door was left wide open for nippit Edinburgh air to cut through an otherwise cosy and traditional place.   The seat I was on wasn't too comfortable either, but that probably wasn't helped by me sitting rigid with the cold.   If it hadn't of been so bloomin' freezing I probably would have really liked this pub. It should have a great vibe to it...  I kind of want it to be one of these old pubs with a Scottish wolfhound flopped down at the hearth of a cracking, cosy fire with his doggy nose on a sailor's booted foot. But it wasn't, because it was baltic.   I wanted to imagine Robert Louis Stevenson penning Kidnapped in this pub, supping ale at a rickety table in the corner and looking out over the river for inspiration. But I couldn't, because I thought my fingers were going to freeze off.   Food looked great. Must come back here to try grub. Remember to bring duvet to wrap self in.",

They have good service behind the bar. Be sure to place all orders behind the bar also. Speaking of the bar, I didn't like Deuchars IPA. It was a bit too watery tasting for my enjoyment.  Anyway, the haggis came with neeps (turnips) and tatties (potatoes). I'm only translating for visitors since I had these same questions. Great food, though the tatties were a bit bland. Compared to the spicy gritty haggis, maybe bland was needed as something different. Solid pub.",

This wasn't my first visit, but I hadn't been along for a good while, so it was great to see their impeccable standards being maintained. In terms of food in a pub setting (pub grub really doesn't quite cover the excellence of what they serve), I can think of few places in Britain that do it better than the King's Wark.

Nestled right on the corner of The Shore in Leith this little hot spot is a great choice especially in the winter months (which is 11 and a half out of 12 here in Edinburgh!) as you can cosy up with a pint next to the roaring fire.    The food here is delicious and great value for money (main meals usually between 8 - 13).  I highly recommend the cullen skink which is tasty and full of fish (no stinginess) - a nice traditional Scottish alternative dish for a change to haggis.  Also the fish and chips is always a winner though I wouldn't have a starter before hand as going by the size of the fish it is more like whale and chips:)    The only thing I'd say is get here early as it is a popular spot at dinner time with the locals every night of the week.  Definitely worth the wait though so why not grab a pint, prop up the bar and work on your appetite to wrestle that fish later:)",

The King's Wark looked promising, though when we arrived it was also fairly empty, which concerned us a bit. It turned out we were just a bit ahead of the dinner rush, so we were given the last table that was not spoken for, a bit of a tight squeeze between two other tables, but still pretty comfortable.  The menu was broad, interesting and well priced. Among the three of we ended up going for two starters (to be had as a single main course) of a haggis Scotch egg and bouillabaisse; and two main courses--the fish and chips and roast duck breast with artichoke puree and blackberries. All the dishes were exceptionally good, and very reasonably priced. This was definitely a fortuitous find!  For dessert we decided to share two dishes among us--the sticky toffee pudding with vanilla ice cream and butterscotch sauce, and the chocolate and hazelnut tart with espresso ice cream. The former was excellent, but the latter was a bit disappointing (especially since we had misread \"tarte\" for \"torte\" on the handwritten menu--our mistake.  This was a great little discovery for us, and continues our trend of having not yet found a disappointing meal in Edinburgh and the surrounds.",

I'd recommend one that's away from the kitchen, unless you want to hear the staff chatting away.   They have some lunch sandwich specials-- I tried the beef one. It is typical pub food, but it tasted pretty good. They also had a special on oysters (one for 1.5). With a deal like that, obviously I had to try two. Oysters at a pub, I know, I know... It sounds like a recipe for food poisoning. But they were some of the tastier oysters I've tried! So if they have them when you're there, take the plunge and order some.  They also obviously have beer, at decent prices. Service was friendly and upbeat. It never got too busy, which is a plus for me but a shame given the quality here.",

    "text": "The King's Wark is one of Leith institutions, located in The Shore area in a 1400's stone & wood building. As we booked a table for 3 we were greeted by our friendly waiter and sat in the restaurant section of this beautiful pub. I got the Beer Battered Haddock with hand cut chips and house tartar sauce (AKA fish and chips), whilst my mates picked the Scottish Angus Burger and the Pan Seared Seabass with potatoes and creme Fraiche. The food quality was very good apart from my soggy and extremely pale chips, a real shame indeed.  We then proceeded to dissect an Eton Mess, no surprises there (either way) followed by a couple of espresso coffees. The only negative minor bombshell was the unilateral addition of a 10% service charge on the bill which was not clarified in either menu (the one outside and the table one) ... that meant no tip was needed as they self-grabbed it. Apart from that, The King's Wark worth certainly a visit!!!",

Considering it IS advertised as a pub, I'm not sure what people could have really expected...decor/atmosphere wise. But anyway, I thought it was exactly what one (or I) would expect from a pub in Edinburgh with very typical pub food. Maybe I didn't have high expectations, but for a pub, this food was great...compared to the usual food you would get at any bar/pub.   I had the seafood chowder which was a bit on the oily side but absolutely amazing and filling. I also decided to be adventurous and try the Haggis which was surprisingly delicious! I can't speak on what anyone else ordered but I did try a bit of the fish cakes and it was decent...nothing special though. The wine selection was also decent, and I had the Chardonnay which was light and sweet as promised.  I'd definitely come back...at least for the Haggis. I had no idea I'd be a fan but wow.",

    "text": "One day during our visit to Edinburgh, my wife and I took a bus to an area called Leith.  Leith is the location of the Royal Yacht Britannia that can be toured (for a fee); in MY opinion, testimony to the enormous  tax payer money wasted on \"Royals.\"  BTW, the \"yacht\" is more like a CRUISER.  After wandering through the mall in Leith, we asked for a restaurant suggestion from the locals.  Someone mentioned a place that had already been suggested by the hotel concierge.  We wandered from the mall into \"town\" and found it.  The menu did not suit either of us, so we looked at the other restaurants next door.  We found The Kings Wark with a menu that was great for both of us.  We happily dined there.  I enjoyed magnificent, FRESH, \"sea bass\" (that I think is also known as \"branzino\" these days) and my wife had the spectacular \"soup of the day.\"  Those two dishes plus a large sparkling water came to only 14.  Probably one of the least expensive meals we had had in the UK.  Service was wonderful and we got to meet the chef!  Other than the yacht, Leith is probably not a tourist destination.  BUT, if you find yourself there, do stop into The Kings Wark and have some great food!",

    "text": "There is a reason why this place was voted best pub food numerous times.  It is because it has the best pub food in Edinburgh and trust me, I have tried a lot of pub food.  I would say the only other one which I would regard highly is the Scran & Scallie but the price is slightly on the higher side.  The good thing about the food here is that they have seasonal specials and highlights the best produce in season.  The seats here are in a way limited especially if you want food.  There is another section for drinks / high seats but best avoid if you want to properly sit down to enjoy your food.  Best time to come is definitely during early lunch.  That said, of all the times I have been here, I have never needed to book or wait for a table as we were early.  The service here is second to none and if you are in doubt on which beer to drink, ask them for a sample and advice before you buy.  Please do give this place a try if you haven't already.",

    "text": "A Leither friend of mine raved about Kings Wark, so on a cold February night, the Silent Reviewer and I took off to explore it's offerings. It's a bit of a hidden spot, right in front of your face. I had always thought it was a bit of a old man's pub, but it has dreams of gastronomy, and is not afraid to show them to you. It has a nice variety of options for meals as well, for meat and non meat alike.  I decided to be adventurous, and try the crayfish and hot smoked salmon roulade - very rich, and needed something to cut through it, for me - but tasty enough. The boy had the hot smoked salmon salad starter... I had a little bit of envy for that - and it also was a tick in the taste tests. For our mains, he had the burger (went down in a flash) with a bacon jus (OK, so this was pushing the SIlent Reviewer a little too far), and I had opted for the vegetarian haggis Wellington.   Sadly, I was given haggis, neeps and tatties. Not a terrible offer, but sent back nonetheless. That meant, whilst tummy grumbling, I had to watch on while the SR muched through his entire meal before mine even showed up, burnt and still incredibly hot.   In fairness, bar the fact it was burned and super late, it was pleasant enough. The waitress didn't even skip a beat when she delivered it and called out that we wouldn't be charged - which I didn't expect, and was a really nice touch. But, a little disappointed for our first time there, and means it won't be top of any list any time soon, but neither will it be at the bottom either.",

I called beforehand to see if any tables were available, they informed me there was only one - right beside the door. I was not too pleased on that but gave it a good go.  On arrival we were surprised how busy it was. FULL on a mid winter wednesday evening? Good thing I 'reserved' the most infamous table of the place.   When visiting do not sit right at that table..period. My friend had to keep her coat on during the time there. My wife kept wearing her scarf . On opening of the frontdoor  a gust of artic wind kept blowing out the candle on our table.   The meal was affected by our uncomfertable position and my saddle of rabbit was served warm but due to the drafty conditions turned cold as soon as i picked up my fork to eat it.   The place is great - when your seating is in a warm spot. Unfortunatly this time we didn't and it does prevent me from going here on a whim again.",

We'd never really been to the King's Wark, except for a drink (when we just grumbled about there being nowhere to sit unless you're eating - still True, and worth noting) but after a quick look at Yelp we decided to go. And, yum.  Portions are big! We'd really have been better to skip starters, or to share, but that's no fun, is it?  I had an amazing bowl of seafood chowder, followed by baked haddock meuniere - while J had black pudding salad and lamb. Talk about gender-stereotyped choices...! But girlie and blokey choices were all just delicious, and cheered up the chilly day.   Staff are lovely and it's a really friendly place. I'll go back!",

    "text": "The Shore has become the place to go for food when my parents are visiting, after all it's convenient for my flat and there's plenty of eating options in the area.  Plus, my mum's a native to Edinburgh and worked in the Newhaven and Leith areas for a few years, so she'll take any opportunity to go down memory lane!  Last weekend, after a visit to the museum, we once again came down to the Shore and this time decided on The King's Wark. As we'd just been to see the Mary, Queen of Scots exhibition it felt appropriate to visit somewhere whose history, and name, is strongly associated with the Stuarts.  The King's Wark, in common with several other pub/restaurants in the area, has a menu mainly focussed on seafood, along with haggis etc.  It's all reasonably priced, verging on pricey for the type of establishment, but given we were just about the only locals in the place (I say local, my parents live in Glasgow) they can probably get away with charging that bit more. That and the food tastes good too.  I plumped for the seafood salad for a mains, whole shrimps, battered fish, Queenie scallops, squid etc, which came with a bowl of chips. Boy were those chips good! I don't know if they were triple-fried or whatever else, but they were crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside - perfect. The fish was okay, the main issue being that the shrimps hadn't been prepared so came complete with the vein. I suppose that's what you get for ordering whole shrimps, but it makes for messy eating.  My mum had something that came with a deep-fried ball of black pudding, but for the life of me I can't recall what the main component of the dish was. Whatever it was she liked it. Dad had haggis (and a smaller version of my salad) and boyfriend had pulled pork, which he was suitably impressed by.  For pudding we couldn't resist getting a portion of the intriguingly named 'Coca Cola Cake' to share. Sticky and more like a steamed pudding than a cake, it was very good. Dark, like a chocolate cake, but not cocoay - the depth of flavour was something more, no doubt the Cola! It was very sweet, as expected, but I found myself eating more than my fair share. Yum yum yum.  The King's Wark is perhaps not better than any of its neighbours, but it's still a very solid option on the Shore and steeped in history, if, like me, that's your thing.",
