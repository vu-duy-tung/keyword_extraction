    "text": "I love subway but this particular franchise is a bit disorganised.  The general concept of the chain of stores is brilliant if it works well but this particular shop never has the correct stock. Some mornings you can get a breakfast sub, other times there is not even bread made at 9am on other days they have ran out of sausage before 9am, there is no consistency.  Also the staff are all mostly foreign which is fine by me but none of them can speak proper english and mess up orders constantly and thier manners are not the best.  Also the toaster has been out of order for about 2 months.  I am all for subway but give this one a wide berth!",

    "text": "Subway is a sandwich shop which has taken on a fast food idea. They offer fresh sub type rolls filled with a variety of meat and salad. All sandwiches are made fresh in-front of you. Unfortunately it s a bit more pricey than other shops and this shop is a bit cramped. Good and easily accessible location.",

The staff are always courteous, and serve you quickly and efficiently. I have never had any problems with this shop and I can highly recommend the Italian BMT toasted!",
