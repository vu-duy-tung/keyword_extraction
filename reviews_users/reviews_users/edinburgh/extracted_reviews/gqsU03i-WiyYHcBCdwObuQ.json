You do get your monkeys worth in weight, big plate with all the fixings, toast, beans, Haggis, mixed sausage and more. Overall the meal was good but a little bland, maybe due to that's the way Scots eat the traditional breakfast, but a little seasoning could never hurt. Good atmosphere on the Royal Mile, but food was just ok.",

It was good and fresh but the fried flavor was strong.  I got the stew with dumplings.  I was surprised at how small the portion was.  The dumplings tasted so strong of rosemary.  This was probably my least favorite meal in Edinburgh.",

The service was not great. It was slow to order, slow to get food, and we literally had to wait almost an hour to pay for our bill and leave. We'd wanted to order dessert and whisky, but since we'd apparently been forgotten about by the staff we finally gave up on that idea.",

Split into two, both parts are always absolutely packed, owing to its location right in the centre of the Mile. It is a bit of a pain to drink in there, as you have no space and people are always barging into you.  The drinks are massively overpriced, and you can expect to wait a while before being served. The staff, if a little overworked, are pretty friendly and try their best. One of the best parts of the pub is the little outside seating are where you can have a drink and people watch on the Royal Mile. Apart from this though, there are few reasons to come to this pub",

It feels pretty warm and welcoming in here, and definitely to the point where it feels inviting enough to stay for more than a couple of beverages. There are whisky options aplenty, plus a menu of Scottish favourites, which I'd probably say are more for the benefit of curious tourists, rather than food offerings I'd be likely to take up on a regular basis. The drinks aren't exactly the cheapest either, but a night out along the Royal Mile is hardly ever going to be a thrifty experience, so it's to be expected. Not somewhere I'd go every weekend for a drink, as I don't feel I can chill in here quite as easily as I can in other bars, but very handy and perfectly pleasant nonetheless.",

This place had a seat with my name on it outside and I was sweltering, so I grabbed it and ordered a pint of Tennants. It was one of those days when only a manly pint would do, and it was lovely, freezing cold like it should be. This is mainly a Whisky bar though, but I didn't try any of that so I can't really say if it does the job.   I believe this is a Belhaven pub so I wasn't too hopeful about the food, but from what I saw, it looked palatable. Will definitely be back for another pint on a sunny day,",

I will never forget you Albanach, you were my first...... haha but seriously its a great pub , has a great menu selection( this was also the place I had my first haggis, god I love haggis), a lot of whiskeys and other beers and drink , and really good staff. They usually have a special on the menu too, which I find is really refreshing (to find a pub with a special I feel like you don't see that that often). But the food is good and the place is clean at least every time I have been in. The restrooms are hidden downstairs and can be a little messy at times but thats only been when its been super super busy I feel like but otherwise they are passable. Staff here for me have always been super nice. They have gotten me a table promptly even when it was packed and cleaned the table for me asap once when I quickly snagged a table from someone leaving. So yea great little place, if you want it to be your first The Albanach will not fail you! The only reason you get a 3 is I don't want you to be perfect and I am leaving room for improvement :)",

Considering The Albanach is located on the Royal Mile, it is a decently priced place serving quality food, with some real scottish flavours on the menu  how about haggis or cullen skink for starters, trout for your main, and cranachan for dessert? The food is delicous, though perhaps lacks a little flair, which makes it a safe-bet for tourists, and an ideal place to take a visitor from out of town. The menu also includes tasty salads, delicious burgers (Aberdeen angus beef of course) and classic sticky toffee pudding/cheese platter options  I definitely recommend the cheese. There is also a fantastic range of whiskies, so when you are done with your meal you can retire to the bar area to continue the scottish taste sensation. The building is separated into two different areas, with a bar area on the Royal Mile (complete with outdoor seating on fine days) and a restaurant out the back, with views out over Cockburn Street. Service is patchy  attentive at times, but slow at others, but the staff are always friendly. Washrooms are down a steep set of stairs, so it may not be the ideal place for someone unsteady on their feet.",

The young guy behind the bar spent ages talking over different whiskeys with him (which got very boring for me) and he eventually picked one, and then another and another.

At first glance, I was having trouble deciding on what to order. Nothing seemed to pop out at me and I wasn't sure I was even feeling \"pub fare\". However, as our waitress walked up, I suddenly eyed the \"Mull of Kintyre Macaroni\". We asked the waitress what her favorite items were and she suggested the Balmoral Chiceken or the Mull of Kintyre Macaroni. So that's what we went with. Boy, we were glad that's what we picked! Everything was fantastic. I scarfed up every bite of the goeey macaroni goodness.  The service was fantastic and we really enjoyed our server. She was friendly and conversational.

Having never had haggis before, i was impressed with how tasty it was. So when we were finally seated, i ordered the balamore chicken stuffed with haggis. Unfortunately, the chicken was a bit dry, but the gravy made up for it. The pesto penne was a bit greasy, but tasty.   Sure the place is a bit expensive, and touristy, but if you don't know where you're going and what you're eating, and you have a very short amount of time in Edinburgh, this is definitely a great place to start.",

Then again, it's your eyes that'll be watering at the amount of cash you will have to dredge from the darkest recesses of your wallet for the pleasure.   Another, and frankly much worse, infringement on my whisky sensibilities is the fact that while Albanach is happy to serve you a dram of whisky for 30+ they slosh it into a straight sided tumbler for you.   Imagine, gents, the promise of Ursula Andres, only for her to come out of the sea wearing a submarine. Ladies, for the purposes of empathy, feel free to substitute David Niven or some similarly suave sex symbol.   The staff are quite good though, I mean, they put up with me telling them how crap their glasses are every time I go in.  In short +1 for whisky, -1 for cost, -1 for glasses, +1 or staff - it's a sum zero proposition, but fine for that (semi) posh 'one or the road'.",

I have never eaten anything bad here, but the venison sausages and the cranachan come highly recommended.  I'm not a whisky drinker - I hear their selection is extensive, though - but I am an ale fan, and was a bit disappointed in the lack of Scottish ales on tap.",

On the way out, to sample a few more scotches that sounded tempting.  Obviously I liked the well-written scotch menu.  I also liked the appetizer portion of haggis (for when you aren't totally sure you will still like it, when it's been 8 years since your last visit and there was A Lot of pints involved in the prior revelation of \"hey!  This haggis stuff is tasty!\"). I also was glad to find a place I could bring my 7 year old.  She was totally into the Mac and cheese, which was soupy and considerably sharp, and really tasty...  but not cheap, by a longshot.",

    "text": "If you live in or are visiting Edinburgh, it's going to be hard to miss The Albanach. This pub is located on the corner of Cockburn street and the Royal Mile, opposite Hunter Square. Is it worth its prime placing?  The Albanach is alright. It's definitely a touristy pub. Albanach translated as \"Scottish\" and inside there is a sort of Gaelic theme. Written on the wall inside is \"bar uisge beatha\" which means something like \"waters of life\", which is where the term \"usquebaugh\" came from, and is thought to be the origin of the word \"whisky\". Although I think the Gaelic word was once used to refer to all distilled drink. See my reviews are more than just a provider of useful tips, but a learning opportunity too.  The Albanach has an okay selection of real ales and a pretty extensive collection of malt whiskies.  If you ask me, popular or tourist pubs are always going to have half decent atmospheres because they are never unfriendly and well kept. So in some ways they do make good pubs. But the flip side is that sometimes a certain magic is lost, and they can also become a bit too crowded. Albanach at least falls in the latter camp, especially during summer and on weekends.",

Just located on the corner of Cockburn Street, the Albanach bar is well known for its range of whiskies.   Whenever I have been in the bar, it has been modestly busy, however saying that, whenever I walk by it always seems very busy! The Albanach is slightly on the pricey side, after my mate experienced paying 4.50 for a pint of Peroni! I think the pint was slowly enjoyed due to its price! The bar is also very cosy with little seating areas through in the back.  The Whisky menu is more extensive than other bars, and has a great selection of malts from Speyside and the Islands! And for the whisky amateur, help is at hand! The staff seemed fairly knowledgeable and were very keen to help!  The food on offer looked very tasty, however the prices on the food menu looked less appetising!   However, due to the fact the Albanach stands out from the rest, it is most certainly worth a visit!",

And to a certain extent, The Albanach fits all of those criteria: a cheeseburger and chips wiill set you back the best part of a tenner, and at every second table in the outside area there'll be somebody staring at a map of the centre with a slightly puzzled expression on their face.  That said, if I ever go for a drink with friends in this area we nearly always end up here at some point during the evening. House wine, although not exactly going to win any vintage awards, is only 12 a bottle which isn't much more than the price of a glass of equally average wine in some George Street bars. Not too shabby at all. Also, I don't know if they've recently had a big refurb but inside it is really nicely decorated. Unlike lots of traditional pubs in the old town, where \"traditional\" means it still smells of the pre-smoking ban days and is always full of old men drinking pints of real ale, The Albanach has lovely slate floors and new polished wood everywhere.  Just watch the step up as you go through the door on your way in. It catches me out every time and yes, everyone can see you.",

It's a whisky bar offering a colourful variety of drams. It is priced accordingly, so a stiff shot in here doesn't come cheap. Saying that, it's interesting learning about whiskeys from the well versed bar staff, and the wide variety of tasty Scottish malts will wet a lot of tourist appetites.  They have a nice menu, again putting a modern, fresh twist on traditional pub classics. I'm pretty sure they had cullen skink - everywhere on the Royal Mile has cullen bloody skink - but the food looks tasty, so I'll gladly take it. As for drinking in here, it's pretty busy throughout all times of the day. It seems just as popular with locals as it is with passing travellers, so that's a good sign that it's universal.

    "text": "When some of my coworkers and I decided to do an impromptu leaving-do/Thanksgiving/pre-Christmas meal, the Albanach snagged the prime position of venue for the evening. Despite my leeriness of venturing too close to the Royal Mile's more touristy (and thus pricier) pubs and restaurants, the Albanach managed to impress me with solid food, decent service, and reasonable prices for the whole shebang.   Despite there being 8 of us piling in on a busy Friday night, the service was prompt and reasonably friendly--not quite the sort of personalized experience you'd perhaps receive in a nicer restaurant, but it was certainly a step up from your local old man pub. We were seated upon our arrival at a table pre-loaded with Christmas crackers (score!) in a cozy but spacious dining area and drinks came out not long after. (Extra perk: the Albanach has a relatively sizeable whisky menu--double score for me!)   We'd already placed our orders ahead of time from the set menu, so that took care of a lot of the normal confusion that comes along with group dining. That sorted, the food when it arrived was surprisingly good--stuffed mushrooms as the starter, veggie tart with vegetables and sauce to drown them all in as the main for the veg-heads, whereas enormous platters of turkey and steaks went around for the carnies. I didn't hear much complaints out of the lot of them except, if anything, that there was too much meat to devour in one go! Considering there were a lot of happy plates going around, I'd say this wasn't the worst complaint for the books!  All in all, the Albanach is a pretty decent joint if you're in the area when push comes to shove. Certainly for the price I think you could do a lot worse in the vast majority of places in Edinburgh around the Christmas season, as we paid around 17 for two courses, fiver for reservations included. Not bad Albanach--you've won me over this round... perhaps I'll make a return at some point for another dram in the future!",

My mom and I got the vegetarian cheese platter which came with a selection of three cheeses, a bunch of green and kalamata olives, a delicious chutney of se kind, bread, butter, and salad. There was lots of cheese, and lots of olives, they didn't skimp. I also got a whiskey on the rocks just to try, and a coke- both were reasonably priced.   The one area that wasn't great was the service- I don't like to say this because everyone seemed quite nice but no one was very helpful! We couldn't figure out how the seating worked, and I asked the guy behind the bar if we could sit anywhere. So we did.....and no one came to help us. So we got up and moved to a different area and got service. We didn't understand how it worked, it was obvious, and some direction would've been nice. Also the service was a little clumsy and no one seemed very knowledgable. I'm sure behind the bar they are but the waitresses were just kind of off. Really nice, but a little awkward. Overall, however, I'd go back.",

    "text": "My family came here to eat dinner after visiting the Edinburgh Castle because it was a convenient walk and my sister had noticed their \"We serve traditional Scottish food all day!\" sign outside. We had just arrived to Scotland not that long ago and were curious about their traditional food. We'd noticed that the outdoor seating was filled with people drinking ales and having a good time chatting, which may be a sign that this is a popular place for beer. However, we weren't planning on drinking and were seated more inside.  Our waiter was very friendly, was quick to give us water, and gave us ample time to decide what we wanted to order. We ordered the:  Beer-battered Haddock served with tartar sauce, chips and peas (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gqsU03i-WiyYHcBCdwObuQ?select=haaFamY1ZlwsVCi_0ftqiw#haaFamY1ZlwsVCi_0ftqiw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gqsU...</a>) - This dish was very good. There were two giant slabs of fried haddock whose batter was fried to golden and crispy and meat was super tender and flaky. The haddock is no doubt super fresh and had an amazing texture. The chips were like steak fries, thick and fried to a crisp on the outside and chunky and soft on the inside. The peas were cooked perfectly and looked like little emerald gems! Highly recommended!  Wee Taste of Haggis (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gqsU03i-WiyYHcBCdwObuQ?select=haaFamY1ZlwsVCi_0ftqiw#uRPJ2wLKBwBYxc9-R5xNDg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gqsU...</a>) - Okay, so we were obviously curious about the infamous Scottish haggis and couldn't leave town without trying it. I'm glad they offered a smaller portion of haggis on their menu, probably knowing that some people only want to try it but not eat a heaping pile. My parents thought they did a good job getting rid of the lamb stench (our family's not big on eating lamb), but I could instantly taste the pungency of lamb with a small scoop and had to wash it down immediately. Even though I was not a fan of this haggis dish (or ANY haggis dish anywhere, now I've learned), my parents weren't completely averse to it. The yam and mashed potatoes lacked seasoning and we could not finish it.  Scottish Beef Stew and Dumplings (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gqsU03i-WiyYHcBCdwObuQ?select=haaFamY1ZlwsVCi_0ftqiw#4Sa988-sWLkRkDISc_hTrQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gqsU...</a>) - This dish was all right, nothing bad but nothing spectacular about it. The beef stew was not as thick as I was expecting it to be, but the restaurant was pretty generous with their meat portions. The dumplings were a little big and doughy, but were not bad once cut up into smaller pieces and dunked in the stew. The stew was served with regular bread and butter, which we couldn't finish.  Black Pudding and Goat Cheese Stack (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gqsU03i-WiyYHcBCdwObuQ?select=haaFamY1ZlwsVCi_0ftqiw#ooV3M_kzV-FpAHFUG53ROg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gqsU...</a>) - So, here is the lamb again. Initially, my sister suggested we order it since we were on a roll with trying Scottish food, but I did not know what black pudding was. Apparently, it's congealed lamb blood. I tried a little of the black pudding with goat cheese (which I am also not a big fan of), but the lamb stench was still too much to bear. After this dish, I think it is safe to say that for me, lamb is only for the eyes and not food. In the end, even my parents could not finish this dish. However, they did enjoy the caramelized red onion chutney very much!  So, needless to say, I'm quite torn about The Albanach. On one hand, I really liked their haddock, but our family, in a brave attempt to try traditional Scottish food, could not seem to adapt to the pungent taste of the lamb. The prices were reasonable for their portions, though, and the service was also decent.",

The cheese sauce was smoky and flavorful in a musky way. The peas and carrots were....peas and carrots. Nothing too spectacular, and the carrots were barely room temperature.   Super expansive whisky selection....I may come back and try. Unfortunately, two shots throughout the day (see lunch) already had me ready for bed, so didn't try any.  Would recommend on the fish pie and whiskey selection, but the peas and carrots could use some work",

Wait staff was very friendly, speedy, and attentive. Food came out quickly, was piping hot, and tasted great!   I got a Brew Dog Punk IPA, which was good and would recommend.   For food we tried the Cullen Skink soup, which was very good and creamy! I had the creamy cajun pasta, spicy but delicious and my mum had the chicken, bacon, and leek pie. She also liked her meal, it came with mashed potatoes and an array of vegetables.  Would definitely come back here again!",

The only downside....out of over 200+ whiskeys they were out of two that my husband really wanted to try.  Granted - they were less common, but it was still disappointing.

The football game between Scotland and England was going on but we got there a wee bit before it started to get a good spot to sit.  We came for the scotch but beer both bottled and draught and wine are available as well as mixed drinks.   Others complained about the small selection of beers but who wants bud light when ye kin git ay bony scots bier to support their efforts, ya kin!!  The food we did not get as we were in the bar only to drink but the restaurant seemed nice enough on another visit.  The whisky selection was second to none and we appreciated the tasting notes on the menu.  See pic. Highly recommended if ya don't mind a wee bit a noise from da locals!",

    "text": "I had just arrived at my hotel nearby, the Old Town Chambers, and was looking for someplace to get lunch while I waited for my room to be ready. I walked into the pub area in front. The friendly bartender asked if I wanted to have some food. I said yes, so she directed me to the restaurant area in the back. So far, so good.   I found a table in back and sat down. The waiter was checking in on the other tables in the room, so I waited for a menu. About 5 minutes later, another customer sits down at an empty table next to me. Right away, the waiter comes right up to him and brings him a menu. The customer orders a drink, says he's expecting to meet a friend for lunch, and asks for another menu, which the waiter gives him. Then I ask the waiter for a menu as well, and the waiter gives me a rather unfriendly look and a brusque \"yeah, sure\" reply. When the waiter leaves, the customer next to me, who now has 2 menus to my none, offers me one of his menus. I gratefully accept.   For the next 10 minutes, the waiter treats me like I am invisible. He doesn't ask if I would like a drink, he never even brings the menu that he said he would bring. Meanwhile he's spending plenty of time in the room taking orders from other customers, and brings my neighbor Jos drink order. The waiter makes eye contact with me at least twice, but doesn't say a word or even acknowledge my presence in the pub. Eventually, my neighbor's friend arrives, and the waiter comes over immediately to welcome him and get his drink order.  5 more minutes pass. I've now been in the place for 20 minutes. No drink order, no menu, nada. So I put on my jacket and leave.   Eff this waiter and eff this place. There's a gazillion places to get some food and a drink around the Royal Mile. Don't waste your time here (like I literally did) running the risk of a POS waiter who will aggressively ignore you.",

Once you walk in though, you're greeted with loads of cozy seating and a really great atmosphere.  We were just in for drinks before our underground vault tour and since the place was pretty empty (which was weird but it was a Tuesday mid day) we were able to get a seat near the bar.  My guy and I went for ciders, our friends went for a coffee and a summer spritzer they had on offer.  Looking around though, it seems as though they have a huge selection of good whiskys to drink as well as beers and ciders.  There really is something here for everyone.  I made my way down to the toilet and passed the kitchen along the way.  There were some delicious smells coming from the kitchen, so I'd be interested next time to sample some of their food.  Great little pub, great staff.  I'm glad we stopped in.",

They also give you soda on tap, unlike most places which only serve by the can or bottle (this is what made my grandma keep coming back!) Would definitely recommend!",
