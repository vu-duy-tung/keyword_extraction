    "text": "Right location, wrong taste buds.  We found this place as we were strolling down Rose St.  on Friday evening.  While we knew there are better Indian restaurants on other parts of town, we thought we'd give it a try especially because there were tables available (I wonder...).  We ordered the ordinary dishes: chicken tikka, veg pakora, mix tandoori, chicken tikka masala and goolab jamun.  Now... I'd have given a 3-star rating if these ordinary dishes tasted ordinary.  Unfortunately, only the goolab jamun and the veg pakora tasted ordinary.  We asked the mix tandoori to be spicy and they came out almost bland.  It came (unexpectedly) with a dipping sauce, but the sauce made it worse as it tasted like a marinara sauce bought from Tesco.  We asked for a spicier sauce, but apparently adding chili to the sauce made it taste like... pasta sauce with chili.  The tikka masala wasn't as bland as the tandoori, but it just tasted like they forgot one or two spices.  One thing for sure... there are many better options for curry in Edinburgh.",

Coming across Tippoo Sahib (or Tipu's Indian Lounge, as it says on their business card), there was still plenty of customers, and the staff found me a table quickly.  The food was tasty, and not massively sized (and so I was actually able to eat it all). The service was quite fast, the waiters friendly and willing to guide me to what kind of dish I felt like.  If I was a local, I'd probably make semi-regular visits. Definitely gets the thumbs up.",

    "text": "Well this restaurant saved our Christmas hunger becasue it was the only restaurant open on Christmas Day in Central Edinburgh. We have been roaming in North/South Bridge area, Dundas Street, Rose Street, part of Cowgate, part of the Royal Mile = everything was closed and deserted !!! (I thought it was the end of the world!)  When we found this Indian restaurant at about 5pm, we first ordered a coffee and deserts. For this I would give 2or3 points because they were so sweet as if eating a lump of sugar (and mostly based on icecream), though of course they were very good. The deserts were just under a fiver and found them expensive. I am used to pay 3Pounds.   Optionless, we dined here at about 7:30pm too. We had a good service and the waiters were okay, though it's a bit True, they come with several suggestions to order this and that, though I think it was a good suggestion to order their 'bread' as you can use it to enjoy the sauce instead otherwise leaving it on the plate. We ordered a starter (mixed kebabs) and main course and the food was tasty and at the right proportions.  A small negative was the sparkling water - we wanted a big bottle and the waiter told us it comes in glasses as the sparkling water comes from a machine (a machine?)  Well, I assume they fill the glasses from a bottle so as you pay more. The glasses were pretty small and the drinks a bit expensive. They merit a 3 points in general, but giving 4 because they saved our Christmas Day.   IF you happen to be a tourist in Christmas, make sure you go to Tesco on the 24th to buy food!  (even the hotel restaurant was closed!)",

And with mix food preference - vegetarian, non - vegetarians and veg with no onion garlic.  The server didn't want to answer and was irritated with our questions.  When we asked to let us sit together, he got more irritated but gave us sitting together.  I would have preferred if he could have been honest and  said politely can't serve with these choices. He DID NOT HAVE TO BE RUDE. Period.  I should have seen previous reviews. This is a Racist place. Indians or dark skin people, PLEASE stay away. This is kind of sad and hilarious that Indian people treating like this.  In end my niece cried, and they asked us to leave. When I said I'm disappointed and your previous reviews says you are racist. To that their reply was Indians are cheap and they want to share food to save money so that's why Indians wrote bad reviews.  I'm like if they pay money in full who are you to tell them not to share but whatever.",

    "text": "Absolute case of reverse racism!!!! As a frequent global traveler, while I love global cuisine, I always look forward to a palate reset every once in a while. And therefore, when we saw this Indian restaurant open right across the street my eyes lit up!  The food by itself was average. But the service was absolutely pathetic. For some reason the waiter, despite knowing we were from India, insisted on speaking to us in broken English. Which is fine! Never had a problem with that. But for some reason , he assumed that if we are from India, we must be cheap!!! It was late in the evening and between the 3 of us, we didn't want to over order. And so I asked him a simple question- what are the quantities like, and how many dishes should we be ordering? His prejudice forced him to assume I was trying to save money! And so he responded promptly without giving it any thought- You will have to order 3 separate dishes!!!! Well, we did and though the roti/ naans were huge, the quantity of the other dishes perhaps did warrant us ordering 3 dishes, but his overall attitude while serving us was shameful.  It is sad when people of your own country look down upon you purely owing to their own insecurities and prejudices. My advise to these guys is- wake up and smell the roses! Your country has progressed a lot since you left your homes and came here to make a living. And be proud of who you are, and where you come from! By disrespecting your own country men, you are disgracing your own country!  Sad and extremely disturbing.   My sincere advise- avoid this place. They don't deserve your business.",

As it was my kids first time eating indian food, we also asked that they did not make it too spicy.  The food did not have any flavor and was spicy, so we did not eat too much of it. When came the bill, we were all shocked as it was over 70 for the three of us, granted we ordered 4 small bottles of spring water.  I complained to the manager and he got pissed off and started being very rude.   Not sure how they could advertised as one of the best indian restaurant in Edinburgh.  I have had much better indian food in France and in the US. Everything there was such a disappointment, from the food to the service!   Spend your money somewhere else.  Not worth it! :(",

    "text": "Well first, apropos the other reviews, I come to an Indian restaurant expecting Indian food   This was good. Service was typical Scottish that we have come to expect. UK just doesn't have the same customer service as Canada but if you accept this then you realize it is just the norm. Food- naan was tasty but my partner said a bit thinner than he likes. I thought it was great. I had butter chicken and it, was sweeter than we normally get. It wasn't bad by any means and we finished to the last drop. Partner had Lamb Balti. This was amazing. I'm not sure that anyone could say it was tasteless so maybe if you want bursting in your mouth, capturing your tastebuds and wrestling them to the ground, consider ordering this. Mango Lassi was standard, No surprises.  The sneak treat was the haggis pakora. As we have never seen that at home we ordered it and both enjoyed it greatly. Whatever you may think of haggis, this one is a good one to try: two crab cake size pieces that were quite tasty and good for sharing. All in all I would come back again.",

We tried the daal, mixed veggie curry, malai sabji, naan, raita, veggie pakoras,bhajji, sliced mushrooms. They all tasted the same and greasy. The malai kofta had no kofta. Just potatoes. The service was poor with the person just being crummy to us. My child was eating lunch and he was banging on the table with a kiddie spoon that I had brought with me. While I was trying to stop him, another waiter comes running to declare that we shouldn't damage his tables. Just grumpy and mean. The portions were ok for us. We ordered 5 dishes for 4 adults and a toddler.  But can't imagine this would be enough for folks with bigger portions than us. Definitely won't recommend or won't go back there again.",
