    "text": "A really mixed bag sums up Bar Soba, quite neatly. Their brand of fusion food is interesting, at times, but is dogged by a lack of restraint, and some poorly executed dishes. I like the design of the place, but it's definitely more of a bar than a restaurant.  Overall, we said: \"I think that some of Bar Soba's attempts at fusion food are just a bit over-the-top. Certainly Ross's main course was off into the realms of the bizarre, trying to span Thai, Chinese, Indian and Spanish cuisines and who knows what else. Seeking to showcase new and interesting flavour combinations is generally to be commended, but this just felt like it was trying too hard. Where they kept things relatively simple, as with my pork ramen dish, things were on a much surer footing. But overall, I think this is somewhere that will capture people's imagination as a place for a drink, rather than as a dining spot.\"",

Their dishes are good, but WAY too spicy! The pad Thai just about set my mouth on fire but, comparatively, it didn't hold a candle to the Thai green curry! I didn't expect to be faced with such intense spice in the island of bland food so was unprepared. I will come back for more pad Thai, but only hoping that they will be able to tone it down a few levels of spicyness next time!",

    "text": "What happened guys, went back after about 2 months since you opened and the food really was not good. The nasi goreng was bland and more than a third of my plate was prawn crackers, which are on the menu for a giant bowl for 2. Think of 5 or 6 prawn crackers spread out on a plate yep they take up a fair ammount of space! The prawn crackers seeemed to be the main stay for 11 with the Satay and Nasi an after thought I really wasnt impressed. The sushi rice for the maki was just bizzarre, watery and it felt like the rice had been through a blender. The missus had a veggy option for nasi goreng and that was just odd. She ordered the same dish at christmas and it was great. I grew up in Indonesia so know my Asia food, when I tried her dish the first time we visited it took me right back to my teens. This time round it was bland. Our first experience was excellent the second was .... dire to mediocre.  We had a party of 12 or so for a birthday celebration and the dishes took ages to appear as did drinks. We were left sitting for extended periods with no drinks and no food.... think 45 minutes between starter and main.  I gave up waiting on our order and went to the bar  and the bar service was the slowest I think I have experienced in Edinburgh loads of people just faffing around without actually doing anything except one guy who looked harassed as you would expect. Sorry I wont be back!",

The vibes were amazing and I was loving the tunes that they were playing. I realised as the night went on that it got busier and turned into a cocktail bar and small nightclub!  For starters I think I had fried chicken satay dumplings with satay sauce, this was a taste sensation. I was in love with these but only got a couple of them and they were sadly, so small!  Then for main course I got pad thai (which I love) with grilled chicken and roasted peanuts, sadly I thought that there would've been some sauce but there wasn't, and the noodles didn't taste that great either. Also the chicken was cold and I only got two chunks.   Now at this point I wasn't that impressed but luckily they saved the pad thai mistake with some yummy Thai Fries which tasted amazing (I couldn't stop eating them) and my dessert which was peanut butter ice cream (I'm obsessed with Peanut Butter!), sticky banana bread and some banana sprinkled with coconut. It was delicious and wasn't too small, but I could eat a good, hearty portion anytime.",

Enjoyed both very much. Not too spicy so each bite retained some individual flavor.   Service was serviceable so no complaints. They seemed to be focused on a high margin group of about 8 younger adults who were ordering drinks routinely - along with some food.   One thing; the wooden stools were uncomfortable - clearly indicating that this a more drinks/bar oriented place, rather than a dining establishment. The drink menu looked good but we just went with a decent Sauvignon blanc. So I'm upping my 3.5* review to 4 since it was good enough to round up.",

Our server was nice but not super competent. She forgot to give me a spoon when I got my ramen and it took forever to waive her down to get one. She never filled up our water glasses or ask if we wanted more. She was nice enough to give us a student discount although we did not have our student IDs on us which is the only thing saving them from a 2 star review. I got a pancake thing for dessert. It was fine I guess. All in all.... Meh.",

I liked the funky ambiance, the super friendly and quirky waitress and more than anything their menu was right up my alley so was their food. Steamed Beef dumplings were succulent and so flavoursome. The could resist tasting my husband chicken satay, and that also was fabulously tasty. I went for the Japanese chicken  katsu curry and my hubby picked chilli chicken with garlic and herbs. Nicely plated and with a good mix of chilli heat, perfect for our taste (we like it spicy)!  Cause we were having such a good time we stayed for desserts and cocktails, their cocktail list is extensive so you can easily find a match for each different palate. I'll definitely would go back, no hesitation.",

However, I was there with a small group for a late lunch, and everyone agreed the food was a bit too sweet for our tastes. Best dishes we got were the salt and pepper calamari and buttermilk chicken katsu curry (SUPER good, I recommend this!) But we also ordered chili tofu stir fry with rice (wayyyyy too sweet), Singapore style street noodles (also too sweet), and crab cakes, which actually were sort of okay but had a rather odd texture and the dipping sauce had a very similar taste to the other two sweet dishes. Overall we thought this place looked better than it ended up being, but I could see it being a fun place to go if you're out on the town and have already had a few drinks and are just hungry for some food ;) reasonable prices overall though.",

The place looks good, very cool interior, and the bar is rammo when I walk past in the evenings, often with the sound of their own live DJ. The express lunch meal deal is great value at 8.95 for two courses, and though I'm usually wary of restricted set menus there are still about 6 options for either course that all sounded surprisingly tasty. Nice touch they they will serve them at the same time if you're in a rush.  I resisted ordering my pad thai staple, then was promptly jealous of my 2 workmates that did. I love that they served the noodles with 4 mini pots of traditional accompaniments (crushed chillies, peanuts, sugar etc), so that you can tailor it to your own taste much like real Thai street food - you don't see that too often here.  I went for some sweet potato and pumpkin tikkis to start which were so flavourful, esp when dunked in the chilli lime mayo - I could (and probably should) have just eaten a bowlful of those! My pork katsu burger main disappointed; I liked the katsu sauce flavour and side slaw but the meat itself was tough and seemed not very good quailty, which kinda ruined the burger overall :(  The service was friendly but needs to be more attentive, and it got even slower as the place filled up. We ended up going up to the bar to pay having waited far too long for the bill. 3-stars is probably about right then, though don't go if you're in a rush!",

We were able to walk in without reservations on a Friday night around 6:30, and they were able to squeeze us in (though with a warning we had to be done within 2 hours which was twice what it took us), so that was nice.   The food portions were large -- both the sampler plate and my rice dish -- but I wasn't quite sure what sort of flavor themes they were going for with them. Though warned my entree was spicy it was just barely a tick above bland.  On the other hand, they have an extensive cocktail and drink menu, and their daiquiris are quite drinkable (even if served in a martini glass).  Service was on top of things.  I would stop in again if the opportunity presented, and there wasn't any other place that caught my eye.",

We arrived around 18.00 on a Friday night and the restaurant downstairs was empty at first, but filled up very soon. Best you make a booking.   The menu was different to what I had expected of a Bar with this name. It serves oriental food, from Sushi to Nasi Goreng.  Plenty of noodle dishes, but also some burgers. I had ordered Nasi Goreng served with an egg on top and an Innis and Gunn Original Beer. I so love I&G! I can recommend the Nasi Goreng. My friends were not so pleased with their food, such best you are really selective and get recommendations from your table neighbours or might also consider to go to a proper Sushi or Chinese restaurant.  The staff was really friendly. Sometimes a bit slow in serving the drinks (considering that we were the only table with people).

    "text": "I really like the Bar Soba's in Glasgow, so when I heard there was one in Edinburgh not far from my work office I couldn't wait to try it out.  6 of us were heading along so we booked a table in advance and asked for downstairs, despite this when we arrived there was no table ready for us and then we were offered one of the bar type tables upstairs where you sit on stools.  At over 8 months pregnant I wasn't so keen on sitting here which the waitress actually spotted instantly before I could even mention it and offered us a seat downstairs.  Bar Soba have just launched their new lunch menu and to celebrate for the whole of April it's BOGOF on starters, mains and dessert, result!  I was relieved to see that one of my favourite main courses (the Nasi Goreng) made the cut as there are maybe 6 starters (plus a number of sushi options) and 6 mains on the new lunch menu.  We ordered starters and mains and then the waiter told us that at lunch they bring the food as it's ready and did that bother us....I guess a bit like Wagamamas...we said okay then wondered what would happen.  5 of us got our starters and main courses all brought out at once, with the final person just receiving their main.  To be honest I didn't really like it (I had ordered sticky ribs and then a burger) and eating my ribs watching my burger and fries get cold was a bit rubbish.  The ribs were excellent and a huge portion but the burger was less than average.  It is made with lemon grass and other spices through it, which I could taste, but you couldn't really tell it was a beef patty.  My friends were impressed with their choices (including california rolls, tempura and yellow curry), so I recommend sticking with one of the asian inspired mains rather than the burger.",

This feels very stylish, clean, and makes a nice addition to the Edinburgh scene, serving noodle dishes and cocktails just off Princes street.  We waited an hour for our food. Whilst I recognise that this was free, they weren't that busy, so I don't understand how it took that long. When the food actually arrived it was very delicious, spicy, as others say, but for me that can only be a good thing! There was a little broth with the noodles, with were not overcooked in the slightest, and plenty of spicy chillis. This was a welcome change in comparison to those at larger chains which offer mild tastes with soggy noodles. We asked for tap water, and got served a large jug with cucumber, strawberries and ice. The service from the waiters was great, they apologised for the delays, but maybe there is something going on in the kitchen?  I may come back to use the 2-1 deal for students, as this would make for a super cheap lunch. As for now, the food gets 4, as does the chic interior, but the time waiting for the food gets a 2, so I will average it out at 4. I hope to update this soonish.",

I felt it was not worth the money we paid which was 27.50 for three courses. Disappointing. The staff had seemed generally fine earlier in the night when serving, but when we had finished our food and were standing around drinking they just looked a bit irritated when pushing through the crowds of us.

    "text": "We took a large party here for a birthday meal last night and... hmm. On a previous trip, the Silent Reviewer and I had a pleasant enough meal, but somewhat forgettable. I was definitely on the fence - but I've definitely picked my side now.   The problem I think is the service - both in the kitchen and in the dining area. With a heaving restaurant last night, the whole place was heaving and there was a clear struggle to keep up. It took an age to get water to the table, and even longer to place drinks orders. the SR refused to order anything after the first drink was consumed - taking too long, he gave up the will to live. We had been asked to leave by 8 - which would have been fine as we started just after 6 - but we didn't get our meals until 7:45. I had to ask for a glass of water 3 times before I managed to get a drink; my sister didn't even get her main meal without having to call someone over to point out the empty space in front of her... drinks forgotton, drinks and food mis ordered, it all felt like much harder work than it should have been. At the end, we had an automatic service charge applied, despite the shambles of service. We didn't pay it.   Food wise - it was as much as a fusion restaurant would be expected to muster - I don't think I've been to a place that calls itself fusion that has been really able to execute multiple cuisines effectively, and Bar Soba didn't impress. Steamed mushroom buns were flavourless, katsu curry underseasoned and too spicy for me (also didn't taste like any katsu curry I have ever had before). The fries and satay sauce however, was delicious. Teriyaki beef was simultaneously tough and undercooked. I'm perhaps being tougher in my review than I should - but the frustration of slow service infiltrated the whole experience to some extent.   On the other hand, their cocktails are pretty delicious. Those did go down a treat (bar the Chilli Shoulder, and Green Mean Tequila Machine) - personal favourite for me was the Aichee Martini. It was here that Bar Soba excelled - if they perhaps had more staff to work the bar, kitchen and floor, and focused on the cocktails and decent snacks, I would personally think that it would be long term a more successful venture.   The only other reason I've given this place a 2 star rather than a 1, is the lack of fight over disputing the bill at the end - after already having drinks (wrong ones and ones that never showed up) taken off the bill, it still felt insulting to fork out a service charge given the lack of it - but once pointed out, it was removed immediately. It's a saving grace, although only a small one.   So after my rather long whingy review, the summary would be - more cockatils please, more staff, forget the food, I'll come back - otherwise, I won't be bothering. Cheers!",

    "text": "it's fairly hard to really rate Bar Soba.  i was only there briefly as i'd stopped by to celebrate friend's birthdays with a quick drink.  however, the venue is central and on a busy saturday night i was able to get served at the bar in under five minutes.  the bartender was happy to advise my friend about what sort of drink she should have based on her taste preference and my glass of prosecco and friend's g&t were under a tenner in price.    while all this was great, i can't say i really liked Bar Soba as a place to go for a drink.  it was loud...like so loud i actually lost the ability to try to have a conversation with people because i just couldn't hear them.  i struggle to understand why people go to places where they can't speak to the people they're with, but maybe that's an age thing... or maybe this just really wasn't my sort of place.  so for the fact i was able to get served quickly, standard drinks weren't pricey, and i managed to get a seat on a busy saturday night this place gets 3 stars.",
