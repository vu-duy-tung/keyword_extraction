The quality of the food is higher than Mussels and Steak (if you are familiar with that place).  We took a short taxi ride over because we wanted to see the Leith area.  It's a cool place - not too fancy - looks like locals go there.  They had only one server working that night so the bartender had to help out.  Needless to say the service was somewhat lacking.  In all a good experience but I would likely try other places in Leith rather than return to the The Ship.",

However, it's the food that is the star here - the oysters are amazing, and go great with a  Guinness or glass of bubbly.  I took my brother in law and his son for the seafood platter a few months ago and we devoured everything. The Bloody Mary Oyster shots are great too!  One of my favourite laid back bars in Leith, though it's definitely geared more towards food than drinking.",

The fresh seafood platter and smoked seafood platter were virtually the same. The portions were big, but the quality was low. I gave it two stars as it was an attractive restaurant, with great staff and good wine.",

The mussels came before the oysters & i was told they would be along shortly. Halfway through the mussels the oysters arrived. The German chap next to me had the same issue but ended up telling them to forget the oysters, should have done the same myself.  Not a lot of seasoning in any of our food but cooked well enough. When the bill came it was someone elses.  Lastly packed in too tigh next to other people.  Not somewhere i would hurry back to.",

    "text": "I hear myself recite the series of words, \"I need to head to Leith more often,\" approximately four times a week. Unfortunately, the effort I make to get to this character-stacked area of Edinburgh, a mere ten minutes away from the centre of town by bus, does not correspond to the amount of times I have vocalised said intention.   This will change for 2012 though...it will! The Shore has a brillant array of hostelries and crustacean-themed restaurants to try, and I am willing to take on the job. Pre-New Year, I started my expedition early with a lovely meal at The Ship on The Shore, where I caught up with two old school friends. Note the catching up element of the event. I partially hate myself for saying this, because it makes me feel like I'm getting old and fond of complaining, but noise levels in a restaurant/bar are important, particularly when you don't see certain friends very often and you actually want to hear what they're up to, rather than just vaguely nodding at everything they say and lip reading 80% of the time because the background music is so loud. The Ship has a good level of noise and bustle, ideal for banter purposes, and just the right amount so that you're not hearing someone's fork crash to the ground from the other side of the room.  So, we've got the atmosphere sorted. Chilled out and welcoming, but lively enough so that it's a highly visited destination of choice at the weekend. Then there's the all important food. We decided to share a bottle of very tasty and reasonably priced prosecco along with our meal, although the restaurant specialises in different champagnes, so I think I'll consider a bottle of the French stuff for my next visit. The menu was a tricky business, due to the fact I LOVE seafood and had difficulty choosing what to eat. I'm planning to go back with a big group of friends the next time, who will hopefully order a large variety of fish, which I can then steal from their plates. My friends both opted for the pot of steamed mussels with garlic, herbs, and lemon, and I went for the risotto main with Shetland salmon, North Sea brown shrimp, and smoked mussels. It was delightful - brilliant texture and not overpoweringly fishy, if you know what I'm saying.   This place is entirely seafood orientated, so don't come along expecting veggie or other meat options, because it really does focus on its culinary dominance of the sea. Prices are mid to high end, but the food does this justice, and the setting is versatile, so whether you're looking for somewhere slightly more upscale for celebratory purposes, or a venue for gabbing with a bunch of friends or family in a more chilled out manner, The Ship on the Shore should fit the bill nicely.",

However, the layout of the tables and separate bar area means that you don't feel as though you're crammed in. On my last visit, I had queen scallops to start with, which were perfectly cooked and served in their shells with chive butter. My boyfriend had sardine fillets which were also gorgeous. For main course, I had roast sea bass with crayfish tail and onion pakora, and fresh masala sauce served on the side which was amazing. Unfortunately due to the incredibly generous portions I had to leave a pakora, which haunts me to this day. My BF had a whole Arbroath smokie with potted shrimps and cajun spiced potatoes which smelled fantastic. He kept trying to get me to taste different bits of it but seeing as I was seeing stars just trying to cram my own main course down I had to decline and take his word for it that it was amazing.  The only downside of this restaurant is that due to the afore-mentioned generous portions, we haven't managed to get to dessert yet. Just an excuse to go back again I suppose, yippee!",

It's now my favourite seafood pub (sorry The Cow) even though it may be a long time before I'm back in Edinburgh. Its on the water, nice pub feel but with maps on the walls and oars on the ceiling. The menu is hand-written and has what seems like every possible kind of seafood done every kind of way, at all ranges of price. Dining alone, I got a nice big glass of the rose and a seafood salad, which was all sorts of fish and shellfish (minus shells) tossed with greens and a very light dressing. Such a perfect lunch!

On the other hand, the steaks, cullen skink and macaroni cheese have disappointed. I've noticed quite a few review sites mentioning the service in here as a bit of an issue and I'd have to agree. They have a bizarre policy concerning children  sometimes they're allowed, other times they're not. They don't allow pushchairs if it's too busy and won't give you a highchair if it's busy either. I've visited with children and been made to feel uncomfortable, and I've also been turned away despite a table being available until I mentioned a pram. I doubt this is policy and more at the whim of the barman I keep encountering, but they need to fix it. The table service isn't particularly friendly but is polite enough. In summary  stick to the seafood, leave the kids at home and you'll probably have a great time.",

Being my first time in Scotland, I tried the haggis appetizer which was super tasty!   I also ordered the Shetland Salmon and it blew my mind. Everything about the dish was excellent.

So now I have had both lunch and dinner, and service was great during both times, though it did take a bit longer to get seated at dinner which was fine, as we had some pre-dinner cocktails at the bar.   There is a lot of fresh seafood dishes to choose from, but the stars of the shows are the delicious seafood towers that are meant for sharing. I have had both the hot and cold and I love them both. The best meal would be if you had enough people to share both platters. The cold platter has the smoked fish that is delicious and the hot platter is serviced with a smokey garlic butter that is amazing.   Also, the second time we came, we had a vegetarian with us and there were enough options for him. He has the Mac n' Cheese, which was served with a salad and chips, so a bit of a carb overload, but he finished it all.   For dessert, the sticky toffee pudding is a must. It is so good.",

The location is lovely as its right by the water with easy bus links back into Edinburgh. Drinks list was exhaustive as was the menu of all things seafood. Oysters, scallops and langoustines were phenomenal!! Absolutely delicious. It was a bit on the pricey side and the staff were polite but I wouldn't say friendly but would definitely go back for the high quality grub!",

My family and I came here recently, and they have agreed that the mussels here are pretty much the best they've ever had. We all had different white fish as our mains, and it was absolutely delicious too.   Just gotta say it's an amazing restaurant. Not too fancy, and great food. My parents loved it so much, they're going to treat my boyfriend and I for a meal there for his birthay in the new year. sweet?!!",

    "text": "Do you like good food, preferably of the piscine variety? Furthermore, do you like ludicrously huge portions? Well, then hie thee to The Ship on the Shore!   Husband and I randomly wandered in this afternoon, soon after our arrival into Edinburgh after having spent the last four days eating gorgeous, freshly-caught seafood on Skye and Mull. I was a little wary of harshing my HIghlands seafood high, so I ordered just a prawn cocktail to start and the macaroni and cheese for my main. The prawn cocktail was absolutely delicious and with super-fresh shrimp. Perhaps a little too heavy on the Marie Rose sauce for my taste, but still great. I'll admit, macaroni and cheese is a weird thing to order at a seafood restaurant, but it was absolutely delicious. Creamy roux, perfectly cooked pasta, and accompanied by a lightly dressed salad and french fries. Yum.  My husband ordered the haddock and chips. Although the portion of fish was as large as his forearm, no quality was lost in the gargantuan size. Great batter, fish was firm and fresh. If I weren't face first into my giant helping of mac and cheese, I would have eaten most of his haddock!   Service was also great and the atmosphere very relaxed. If I were in Edinburgh longer, I'd definitely visit again -- I'd love to try their brunch.",

    "text": "Had an awesome seafood meal here on a Saturday night. I love the cosy but elegant decor in here and spent a good amount of dinner coveting the wallpaper of old style maps for my own flat :)   The service wasn't perfect - a little slow and they forgot the second round of drinks we'd ordered with our mains (though this turned out to be fortunate as we'd been a bit ambitious!). The tables are also packed quite closely so with our table being one in the centre of the room you do get a lot of waiters walking by.   We could forgive this though as the food was great - my whole sea bream was far too big for me but yum, esp once my date showed me the best way of slicing the fish to avoid a mouthful of bones (*skills!*). He'd got one up on me anyway though by being more adventurous and going for the seafood platter - oysters, mussels, salmon, prawns, clams and other unknowns - which was also way better value for money.  Nice setting for a special meal for seafood lovers - I'd go back, next time outside of festival time and having starved all afternoon so I made it to dessert!",

    "text": "After reading all the positive reviews we dropped in as a special treat on a Sunday afternoon.  The restaurant is lovely and very classy ...unfortunately that was as good as it got.  Most of the main courses sounded like starter's or snack's only at expensive main course prices.  For example Lobster Crepe or Lobster/Beef Club Sandwich or Chowder or Mussels.  For started my Husband had the Cullen Skink which was boiling hot and he had to leave it for 10min before it was cool enough to taste and even then it turned out to be... tasteless.  I had fish cakes which were ok but nothing special.  For mains my husband ordered the Sea Food platter which was a mixture of shell fish, salmon, haddock and herring all served cold and very bland.  I had the Lobster/ Beef Club Sandwich which was overpowered by Tomato and Lettuce. This again was ok but nothing special (I have had better club sandwiches in the local pub at a fraction of the cost).  Bottom line is we spent 80 on a very average meal and a couple of drinks and in all honesty we would have been better spending half at the local.",

I have frequented the Ship on the Shore but never eaten in there owing to the fact that my other half has issues with all things out of the sea.  It was a Tuesday and the place was packed but we were seated immediately (I think more down to luck than anything!). They didn't seem to have enough staff on to cope with the influx as we did wait quite some time to order, have plates cleared etc...  Now to the whole point of my review...the food. WOW! I have to say I didn't have a single thing that wasn't exquisite. I highly recommend the hot & cold smoked salmon for starter as it was out of this world in terms of flavour.  My friend loved the place equally as much.   I think my other half can suck it up and sit with a bowl of chips the next time I'm in the mood for seafood as I have to go back there.",

Was a little put off by the prices but was promised that the place was worth it.   This being a specialist fish restaurant, I ordered a steak, which came out nicely done. The missus had a fish platter and did really enjoy it.  Service was a bit slow but generally ok.  Over all it was a reasonable meal, but I don't think it was work 20 quid a main course, you can get as good a mean for a lot less.  Won't  be rushing back, but as the missus is a big sea food fan I suspect I may get dragged back at some point.",

I told her the service was pretty but we were in a rush to have dinner anywhere and head of to a show. She said it looked OK, whatever. We both had the mackerel special. She chose the prawn starter and I had the haggis filo.  Service still bad. The waiter came by to take our order and put down dirty dishes from another table on our table while he took our order. There was also a ash tray full of cigarette butts which I moved towards him to take away (we don't even smoke), he just put it on the floor by my feet. um, ok.  Now, the food was OK but it gets worse. The next morning I wake up throwing up and completely sick. The entire day feeling ill up until today (Sunday). I have not had food poisoning like this in a long time. My friend is fine so it must have been the starter I had since we both had the same main.",

It's casual, down to earth and cozy with incredible, delicious, fresh fish and seafood. Does it actually get any better than this?  I have now been a handful of times and every single time has been an absolute joy. I most recently went last weekend with my family and pregnant wife and once again we were not disappointed. I had a grand pot of steamed clams with chorizo for a starter and then utterly divine monkfish tail with beautifully cooked rice in a cheeky little masala sauce. It was a bit 'out there' but boy oh boy was it good. I also had a couple of great spoonfuls of the paella jammed with so much fish and shellfish that it was fit for four people that my dad and brother shared and I nicked a few 'Ship's chips' off my wife who had half a Berwick lobster.  With excellent, chatty, friendly service and a great, not too corkagey wine list I feel totally at home at this place. There are places in Edinburgh with better food (but not by much!) and places with more polished atmospheres but in the food/coziness x friendliness ratio the ship wins hands down in my opinion.  Blinking marvellous.",

It didn't quite capture my heart in the way that it could or should have, and their Cullen skink didn't hit the mark, but their seafood platters are something very special, and must be sampled. A great mix of traditional pub atmosphere and dazzling seafood theatre, the Ship on the Shore is a richly rewarding experience.  \"I'm glad to have finally sampled the Ship on the Shore's seafood goodness. As a place to send seafood lovers, I think this would be top of my list of recommendations.
