    "text": "Its always great when you find someplace new in Edinburgh.   Stumbled upon this little basement bar just off Candlemaker Row on Saturday and what a great find it proved to be. The place has a very comfy feel thanks to the basement setting and mix of furniture of the kind usually picked up from a second hand shop. It was a little quiet when we arrived on Saturday lunchtime but since it's not the most obvious location this is to be expected and will probably be a plus point as far as I'm concerned.   When ordering food I was a bit dissapointed to be told the item off the specials board I was interested in was off. How can a special be off so early in the day? Take it off the board in that case. I settled for a burger with red pepper pesto instead and my partner had a salad. The burger was homemade and grilled to perfection, accompanied by some sweet potato chips. Both of us were happy with our choices and would definately eat here again.   I'll be checking out Under the Stairs again soon to see how it shapes up as an evening venue.",

I must admit I normally avoid bars in this area of the city, the cowgate adjacent has carried a smell of rancid excrement for as long as I remember. However I'm always game for a challenge and held my breath on the way in.   The bar was pretty busy when I got there, full of people who were obviously regulars and, as such, commanded the special attention of the Bar Staff. As such I found the service very slow and the drinks menu was dissappointing, however as I was in good company I was happy to stay longer.   The decor is remeniscent of your grannies front room, in a twee attempt at shabby chic and is probably better appreciated when the bar isn't quite so uncomfortably full. As a basement bar the celings are very low so it is altogether a claustrophobic excersise on a busy evening.   As a new bar, I wish it every success but am in no hurry to revisit + the smell outside has put me off ever eating food there.   Ess",

The good: its fairly unassuming. Too many trendy bars around the town's center feel like all they need to do is stick a bit of designer wallpaper up somewhere and they've got a vibe. This place manages with less decor than most; dark wood floor basement-looking space and a clutterf**k of scruffy chairs give it that 'extention-of-your-livingroom' feel.   The bad: Prices are up on some similar places nearby. The service can be slow [see below] and the music is confusing. By around 10 on a fri/sat night there already queuing peeps at the door.   The ugly (but oh so funny): The bar doesn't actually have a bar license so you order and pay for drinks and the staff come around the side of the bar and serve you from a tray. Yes, really. Sounds like it'd make the service slow and hectic at the weekends; you're right!   Somehow, I'm going to keep going here on the odd night, not sure why but look forward to the place getting to grips with itself.",

Nice selection of drinks, and table service to boot. Lovely music in the background, and an nice photo display on the walls. It was a bit chilly inside that's all, maybe some heating for the really cold Edinburgh days. Altogether a pleasant afternoon under the stairs!",

I was first in my group to arrive and was told at the door that there was no bar service and I needed a table to be able to stay. Luckily my wife had booked a table so we weren't turned away. This policy ensured that the place wasn't at all crowded so that was one potental problem dealt with. The service was friendly and attentive so we were well stocked with drinks the whole time - and the range to pick from is excellent though not the cheapest. The menu was also really good and I settled on a baked brie thing for starters and the chicken pasta with spinach, peppercorn and parmesan. This was one of the tastiest meals I've had and the portion size was perfect. The food prices quite decent too. All up I had a really good night here and highly recommend it - just make sure you get there early enough for a table or book it in advance.",

When Under the Stairs opened it was a godsend to have a nice, friendly, clean place in the vicinity of the Grassmarket and Cowgate, an area where most are pretty unpleasant (The Bow Bar, Hula, Jolly Judge, Rudi's deli and Dragonfly aside). Turns out it's an independent, that's obviously adding a lot to its charm. Decor is shabby chic with a bit of up and coming artist on the walls. Hard to get a seat a lot of the time, but it's a small bar. Going early is recommended. Quality beers on tap, Kirin and Red Stripe included, and a nice wine and cocktail list. The music is always great, although they clearly have a few problems with residents so it may suddenly get turned down I find. All in all a lovely place, and they know how to make a good coffee so in the daytime it's nice to get a seat at the window and chill out a bit in the underground.",

The music was up too loud and I struggled to hear what my friends were saying. We were rather a large group at times, and I got the sense that they weren't used to that, since there were no areas or tables set up for groups of more than three or four (we numbered seven or eight). However, the food was most delicious (I had the bread with olives) and the mojitos were lovely and went straight to my head. All in all, it was a nice night out.",

    "text": "On first impressions, I have to be brutally honest and say that this place doesn't look like much. Tucked down a flight of stairs on the edge of the grassmarket, if it weren't for the sign on the railings outside you wouldn't even notice it's even there.  However, once you get inside it's a whole different matter. The furniture is quirkily mismatched yet somehow still stylish, the bar is extemely well-stocked with a huge range of drinks you wouldn't expect to find in an average bar, and the staff are extremely friendly and polite. More importantly... they make a great dirty vodka martini!  At one end, there is a full set of DJ decks and the barman told me that they do put on a live set once every two weeks or so (nearby residents permitting!) At the other end of the long, low-ceilinged venue, there are vintage comfy sofas to while away an afternoon on - something which is very easy to do in a place as relaxed and chilled as this!  Rather than being a bar that serves the odd bit of food, or a food place that serves drinks, it does seem as though Under The Stairs manages to do both equally well. The food menus are printed on LP sleeves and contain everything from burgers to salads to pastas ranging from 6-8. The one that won me over was the Falafel Burger with Mint Yogurt Dip, topped with Applewood Smoked Cheese and served in a flatbread for 7.85.   If you're not feeling that peckish, I spied some other people sharing the bread and various dipping oils alongside their bottle of wine, and I have to say it did look tempting.  For 2 main courses, a cocktail and a pint of Kirin you can expect to get a bit of change from 25; the drinks prices are the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars... everything else about this place is amazing!",

It is a lovely place to sit  and drink with friends. The decor is chilled and it is comfortable and cosy. I like the fact you're sort of packed in with everyone else which makes for a really lively atmosphere sometimes but at the same time makes it feel quite European and relaxed.   Food - never had it but their specials are always very tempting so I'll have to go soon and check it out!  Drinks - they have an excellent range of beers, wines, spirits and cocktails but these have been lauded at length in other reviews so I reckon I'll leave it to those who have explored the available tastes on offer more broadly.   Service. Slow and sometimes a little bit cold if I'm being brutally honest. The staff seem frustrated and rather annoyed some of the time as it seems to be quite hard for them to get around and take orders. Also it's a bit weird not just being able to go up and order at the bar.  However It's not enough to actually make me drop marks but perhaps the only thing stopping this from being a 5 star review.  The Quiz - IS FANTASTIC. I've no idea who the dude is that runs the quiz but he's awesome. He is clear and writes some interesting questions. He's also got a strong anti cheating policy which I strongly encourage. It's just long enough to be appropriate for a school night and the competition strong enough to keep you coming back. Get in there early if you actually want to get a seat!  So! That's my review of just the quiz... I really need to control my mind spew sometimes.",

They also have a sharing menu which is available until midnight so great shout if you get the munchies or need something to soak up the alcohol.    The only bad thing I'd say is this place is popular and does get rather busy.

    "text": "Under the stairs is a funny old place because on the one hand it's secluded and atmospheric enough to be awesome, whilst on the other it's cool and kitschy enough to be kind of annoying.  That dichotomy is True of most things with this bar and more than for most other places for every negative, there's a clear positive that stands in opposition to it.  Under the Stairs is in the minority of bars in the area that run exclusively on table service; meaning if the place is full when you arrive, you're not getting in. Taking the obvious limited space problem out of the equation (which in itself can either be brilliant as it keeps the place from becoming another city centre meat market) the table service is still a double edged sword of sorts with the most sway coming down on how attentative the staff are. If there are enough people on and they keep a good enough eye on how you're progressing with your drinks and food then it can be a great experience. If however you're having to get up and chase them down every time you want something else to drink then it makes the whole idea of not being able to go to the bar pretty redundant.  I've been a couple of times before and find the staff and most of the clientele to be pleasant enough and it's quite reasonably priced for a \"cool\" city centre bar. The selection of beers is nice and varied and the food I've had was worth the money I paid for it (even if the falafel is a little bland - bloody good sweet potato fries though!)  It's four stars then as long as it's on the right night and you get the service you deserve. If you turn up and it's pretty busy, it might be wroth knocking one of those bad boys off. I'd definitely check it out though and make your mind up for yourself. I'll be going again.  Just make sure you check your bill - mine had an extra ten pound added on for something we didn't have which in these trying economic times is enough to feed a whole bunch of hungry Yelpers a whole load of fudges...",

Fine for me, but might be annoying for a taller person there to have dinner. The menu was right up my ally, especially after a week of sampling heavy pub foods. The cocktail menu is super creative, and my bloody mary had tons of veggies in (the only thing I love more than a good bloody, is a good bloody with food in it).  Food wise, there was plenty of options for a veggie and seafood loving gal like myself.

As Jenny L and Chris M have said, it is a small place about half-filled with (pre-booking required) tables, and the rest of the space isn't terribly conducive to standing about.  Because of this, they stop letting people in before the place becomes sardine packed, which is really rare, and really nice.    My meal here was very reasonably priced (three mains, a bottle of wine, two cocktails a whisky, and a dessert, about 60 pounds) and nice.  I'd read Chris M's review where he commented on the meh-ness of the falafel burger but I love falafel so much I had to try it for myself.  Unfortunately I have to say I agree with him, but again as he said, the sweet potato fries were very yummy, and my friend's halibut was also apparently quite nice.  I'm with the others on the service in that our waiter came by every five minutes looking for our order, but once we'd placed it it was pretty difficult to get anything else.  I think I've decided that the trick is to go here during the week.  It is considerably less busy and you can easily get a bartender to help you with anything.",

To be frank, I think the whole \"order at the bar or not\" dilemma could be easily sorted if the management put a sign at the bar clarifying that orders are taken at the table, and please wait to be seated, as seen in similar establishments in New York. Sorted! My experience going on a busy Friday night with no booking was very positive! We were quickly seated by a very friendly waitress and didn't have to take long to order our drinks and later some food. It got very busy but we still managed to get the staff's attention when we needed to. I had the special main of tuna which was delicious and my friend's steak was done to perfection and just how she wanted it. The veggie burger was a bit of a disappointment flavour-wise but the sweet potato fries were delicious!I have to agree with other reviewers that their prices are a bit high for their drinks.

I reckon this would be a great joint to start an evening of fun in. A bite to eat and then some cocktails...",

The crowd that come here relaxed, sometimes arty, and just a bit different, and I get a really good feel about lounging in here for a good while every time I come in, because it's ultra homely and welcoming. When you're sitting with a group of friends, because of the arrangement of the decor and chairs and tables, it's kind of like you're in your own little compartment of a room, which is nice if you're having quite an in depth chat, rather than party talk.  Under the Stairs serve a range of very decent food, with some dishes available to share until midnight, plus they have a funky little cocktail menu, which includes the tasty pamplemousse cocktail with pink grapefruit liqueur and the good old classic mojito, which I'm always partial to.",

With comfy sofas and armchairs set around a wood burning stove, this bar offers classy drinks, continental lagers and tasty nibbles. If you're after something more substantial, it also has gastro-pub style meals, which, if I'm honest, are sold at gastro-pub style prices, with a main course costing around 10-15. As it's a small trendy hang-out it's probably worth booking ahead if you're eating, but as a place to have a quiet drink and escape the bustle of the Old Town it's ideal. Definitely worth a visit if you can afford it.",

They house furnishings I'm convinced were snagged from a skip, yet have managed to skilfully place them under the 'shabby chic' umbrella. A DJ booth sits casually close to the diners and the bar staff are all top notch.  One of few places to sell Kirin Ichiban (a Japanese lager) which is a mouth watering novelty. The food is excellent too, I recently scoffed a expertly cooked rib-eye steak with mash and a red wine reduction.  Great for casual drinks and quality food.",

Like Underdogs, Under the Stairs is looking for a relaxed vibe - less hen party and more high end. And the good thing here - no queuing or fighting the crowds to the bar. It made for a much more amenable catchup space than the previous bar myself and other Yelpers visited that night.",

I think the new table service is related to an Edinburgh Planning thing that was imposed on Under the Stairs, rather than a conscious decision by management or something. Don't quote me - I wouldn't.  I was a bit gutted when I first stumbled in after they'd introduced the table service though... it just didn't seem to suit it, but like you suggested, I think that kind of service can be fine - great even - as long as there's enough people working and if they seem happy to be serving you. The night I went seemed a bit chaotic and not the most inviting, but the table service thing was VERY newly-imposed so all's forgiven. Every time before that it was fine. I haven't been there for a while and I'm due for another visit.  I love the place, I love the feel of it. It's like a little retro lounge cave. Good food too - I could smash some of those sweet potato fries right now.",

Under The Stairs is what I'd describe as 'grand' ....in a very Irish way.  I should clarify, it's alright, it's ok, it's not first in my list but it's not last. Honestly, I think it's on some other list as I've never had a 'oooh, I think we'll go to Under The Stairs tonight' feeling.   Since they started the table service the demographic shifted up a wage and age bracket simultaneously. The cocktails are great but not the best around. The drinks selection is good, the food looks great (I've never eaten here), the clientele are all very trendy....and yet, meh. You won't find any craic here besides that which you bring with you- and I think that's why I've never fully warmed to it.  And holy moly the toilets....I do not like them.

It has a shabby-chic vibe, with an odd assortment of vintage furniture and bric-a-brac dotted around the place a good drinks menu (decent variety of whisky's and vodkas and usually something like Ichiban/wheat beers like Erdinger etc on tap) and a 'trendy pub' food menu (sweet potato chips,gourmet burgers etc. quality's ok but nothing to write home about). However, it's the bar here that's the star. In the evening there's always a buzz from the open kitchen and it's usually busy. The friendly staff and mix of eclectic (and sometimes very comfy) seats makes this place feel more like your front room than a bar. It can get a tad claustrophobic when very busy what with the low ceilings and maneuvring's into awkward corners but it's a cool place that doesn't take it's coolness too seriously. One warning.....watch out for the entrance, it's a small menu attached to the railings, as the name suggests it's a basement bar.",

If you are not eating, you get seated in the front away from the dining crew, where they have such cute decorations and furniture. The ambiance was very .. comfy, I guess. I felt like I was at home. As we only came in for a drink right before closing time, I can't say much about the food. But the drinks were exceptional! And the service was great. Everyone were very friendly, and quick with taking our orders and asking questions about our travels and Norway. This gem certainly reminded me of many hidden gems I have come upon in Brooklyn, and it definitely made me very nostalgic. When I return to Edinburgh, I will come back here and hopefully try more of the cocktail menu and the food! If you are in the area, you certainly should stop by!",

The little low-ceilinged basement bar is cozy as all getout, with couches, armchairs and tiny tables for two packed in like sardines - cozy, cozy sardines. It gets busy early and stays busy late, but the helpful staff will somehow manage to wrangle you a table at the last minute.   If you're after a bite, the kitchen will deliver in spades. We've tried the pan-seared coley, the mushroom thyme rigatoni and the beef burger, and they were all excellent. The portions aren't heaping big, but the flavors will have the classiest of patrons licking their plates.   While the kitchen is more than competent (and turns on a light when a dish is ready instead of clanging a loud bell) the real draw of Under the Stairs are the cocktails. Mary Under the Stairs is spicy and hearty, Chili Palmer is equally spicy but simultaneously refreshing, the Mango Margarita is just sweet enough and You're A Plum is plum perfect, featuring such rare ingredients as plum liqueur and nettle cordial.   As far as I'm concerned, there are few places better for curling up on a rainy day and nibbling on a charcuterie platter or fresh crab cakes while savoring a meticulously-crafted cocktail... or three.",

The staff insist on table service, which is okay, but not when you're waiting for the bartender to finish their dinner so you get asked if you want another one. I felt like I was waiting for ages, trying to make eyecontact with the waitress. Also, when a party has already started a dinner bill (I wasn't eating though) it gets complicated when you get the massive bill at the end!  They should have a system like this:   - go up to bar -order drink -pay for drink -take drink to table, or allow them to take drink to you (if they really want!)   Voila!

I've been here on quite a few occasions now and even I can't make my mind up on the place.   As the name suggests Under the Stairs is a basement venue just off the Grassmarket, which makes the place feel cosy. The lower ceiling and eclectic mixture of furniture give the place a very intimate bohemian feel however the mis-matched tables and chairs can be a tad frustrating. Last time I was there I was sat at a table I couldn't get my legs under. When the place is busy not being able to get your legs under a table becomes a major problem as you end up blocking people trying to get by you. The tables are REALLY jammed together and you'll often end up bumping in to people sat behind you if you try to move your chair.   The whole issue with service is a bit weird too. They insist on table service, which is fine when it isn't busy and staff have time to check on tables, but it becomes a problem when you can't get anyone to take a drinks order because the place is hopping. A little flexibility to allow people to order at the bar would be ideal.   The food is lovely here and is really its saving grace. The menu has a great selection of main meals and nibbley bar food; plus the specials board keeps things interesting. I've never had the burgers but I hear they are really good, especially as they come with sweet potato fries.   A few flaws to work on, but on the whole, not a bad place to eat and drink.",

I admit, however, that there can be an air of confusion upon arriving, regarding the slightly (only slightly) odd restrictions regarding seating, eating, and table service. I had heard (unconfirmed) that this was a licensing issue, but that doesn't fully explain it.  We should all admit, also, that while the format of the place with its blurred boundary between bar and restaurant is not UK typical, it's not so strange a format for other places.  Anyway, Under the Stairs has a nice vibe and decent Food. What I particularly like about it is that there's decent gastropub fare like burgers, fish 'n' chips, etc but they also do less intense, less stomach-busting options as well.   I like it.

They offer table service which is great, if it worked. It took about half an hour to get my first drink. Repeat drinks were also an issue. At one point i was sitting without a drink and a waiter came and cleared the empty glasses away but didn't ask if i wanted anything, so we asked for a bottle of white wine and he looked at us as if we'd asked for a Swedish massage.   All in all, this was pretty disappointing. Maybe if they changed some staff this place would be awesome!",

I love its quirky, comfy and cozy decor - mixmatched chairs, armchairs, plates and cutlery. It has a great cocktail menu and a food menu that changes every couple of months but which is always good value for money. They always have sharing platters with cheese and meat so it is good for small nibbles with friends.  You can go for dinner and/or drinks but I would recommend booking as it is quite small, so if often quite busy. It is not the best option for large groups.   It always has a great atmosphere too.",

    "text": "This is a review dedicated explicitly to Under the Stairs' Bloody Mary, or, more accurately, their Mary Under the Stairs. It's really quite difficult to find a good Bloody Mary in Edinburgh. Sometimes when you go to a pub and order one, the bartender will just look at you with this hopelessly lost expression on their face, wondering what exactly a Bloody Mary is. I once ordered one in Teviot's Library Bar and all I got was tomato juice with a celery stick in it. Not a drop of vodka. It was disgraceful.  Under the Stairs, though, does it right. They do it better than just right. Instead of using cheap vodka, it's made with Bison Grass Vodka, which, I assure you, will knock you out almost immediately. My friend mentioned this to me, and I laughed at her, claiming she was a total lightweight. How wrong I was. There're also chunks of cucumber, and sugar snaps, whole pink peppercorns, and fresh basil leaves. It's. To. Die. For. Ok, so it's a bit pricey (at 6.10 a glass), but utterly delicious. The burgers, as a side thought, were also very good.",

Look more closely (erm!) under the stairs and you'll notice the cosy glow emitting from behind the windows, and happy folk enjoying a pint. Head downstairs and you'll find a quirky bar full of shabby chic, wooden tables and wonderful photography!  I first came here with lovely Yelpers to do the popular pub quiz on Monday nights (9pm/1entry) and have returned for more quizzing action since. The quiz is good fun and challenges the grey matter well!  There is a great selection of drinks available, not a massive selection, but perfectly adequate, and the menu is interesting and varied. I had a risotto cake the last time I ate here, and it was delicious. The sweet potato fries looked tasty too however, as we know from previous reviews, they are only for the privileged few who order burgers! Prices are pretty reasonable too.  Under the Stairs is too wee to have folk crowding round the bar and they don't really let people stand... so this bar is table service only. This is really the one main thing I dislike about the place. The staff are, at times, are not the friendliest or most attentive, and it quite often takes a while to catch their eye. When 'table' service is what they're all about, I would expect the staff to pay more attention to the actual 'tables'!   And my top tip...you can't book a table to drink, so if you're coming in on a busy night, pub quiz for example, then make sure you arrive at least an hour earlier to ensure you have a place to sit!  I like this place, it has a good vibe and I will, no doubt, make many return visits...but I really do hope they get the service issues sorted out!",

The Mango Margarita isn't exactly a great combination.  I love tequila so gladly finished my friends drink, as the mango does not mask, or lessen the flavour of the tequila.  Traditionally Margaritas are made with a more bitter flavour.  Maybe Acai would be interesting?  The Citrus punch is good, but the Mojito is what has brought me back 3 times in one week.",

Cosy atmosphere sitting in car boot sale furniture with arty decorations on the walls (Red Door Gallery) and little treasures in hidden corners (lovely old sewing-machines).   The wide choice of drinks offers also German Erdinger and Japanese Kirin beer besides cocktails and classics - each to its own.   Vibrant and young customers in a really nice atmosphere!

    "text": "I've been to Under The Stairs once or twice in the past and liked its ambience and cocktail menu, but this was my first visit for food. Unfortunately, I didn't have a very good time.   We had placed a booking for eight people and had a table set aside for us. I arrived to find that the place was freezing; not the best atmosphere to eat your lunch in. The back door was propped open, so the rear of the restaurant felt like a windy alley. It was baltic! I sat with my jacket on for the whole time.   We ordered food, but had to wait approximately 45 minutes to an hour - I can't remember the exact wait time, but it was absolutely ages. A couple that arrived after us received two courses and left before we got fed. We were all starving, so even with plenty chat to keep us occupied the wait for food was ridiculous.   The saving grace was the actual nosh. I ordered the goats cheese and potato salad dish, which came in around 7.50, so not too expensive. Unfortunately, because we'd been waiting for so long it wasn't enough to fill me up. The portion size was not really big enough so I wouldn't order it again despite being nice - I really expected a large salad but all I got in the way of greens was a sprinkling of rocket. Not ideal.  Everyone else seemed to have a lovely meal, however. The falafel burgers and beef burgers were massive and came with amazing looking sweet potato wedges and a side salad. The lamb kofta looked brilliant too.    So I clearly ordered the wrong thing. Pick the burger and you'll be good to go.   After the main course, we waited a loooooooong time for the plates to be cleared. We wanted to order hot drinks but the table service was very, very slow so again we waited a considerable amount of time.   We got to order hot chocolates, but when mine arrived it wasn't warm enough, and it was the same situation with another diner on our table. The guy did return our beverages lickety split with much hotter milk, so I was happy with that but it shouldn't have arrived luke warm in the first place.   All in all, a mixed bag. The place is quirky and cool and is affordable, but the service was very poor, the windy draft was terrible and I didn't really enjoy my meal. For me, there were too many negatives to make this a good experience and I won't be back for food again.",

Thankfully a couple left just as we arrived so we were able to snag a table pretty easily. The drinks are lovely and the flavor profiles are rather unique. I love spritz drinks so I really enjoy that they rotate the flavors seasonally at least.   The last time I was in Edi, I stopped by maybe 2-3 times on my way to or from dinner for a cocktail. I tried to order different cocktails off the menu to taste as many as possible. I enjoyed every one of them which is surprising. Sometimes when a place tries to be different and interesting, the drinks can fall flat. These were exactly as described!   I don't often eat here but one afternoon, we grabbed a cheese board, roasted turnip and hummus. The turnip was DELICIOUS. I was shocked since I never really care for them most days. I liked that the hummus was served with (i think) endive leaves. It added a nice crunch to the bite. The cheeses and bread were great. I have never seen one particular item before.... Pickled grapes. Wow. They were so interesting. The vinegar flavor was not strong but it added such a unique flavor to the otherwise sweet fruit.",

The fries were nice and crispy, and the burger came with a dollop of raita (would need more to be honest).  The restaurant itself is really cool, with a lot of mismatched retro furniture. The staff is super nice, and they made sure I would be in and out within 30 min. I enjoyed my veggie lunch by a nice fire, in a completely deserted room. I asked why that was, and the staff explained that they had just opened 10 min ago, they don't usually have a lot of people in for Sunday lunch. Fair enough.

I was told that there used to be a lot more soft seating. It is now tables and chairs all cramped together. I felt like I was intruding on the couple that were sitting at the table behind us.   I have also been told the food and drinks menu has changed a lot. Any way I had a look through the menu. It's a selection of small, medium and large plates and sharing platters. I chose the cuttlefish ink risotto with smoked eel, apples and pork crackling. This was divine. I've never had ink risotto before so was pleasantly surprised by the plate full of blackness. For a large plate this was not enough for me though. I have to say I probably have a bigger appetite than the average person. So of course I had dessert. I got the hazelnut cookies with ice cream. I was expecting a soft warm cookie but it was very hard. Still tasted nice but it was difficult to cut with a spoon. I ate it all, obviously.   I felt the drinks menu was just a bit too expensive, however I have kept in mind it is Edinburgh, and the Grassmarket. I was having cocktails which I enjoyed most of (there was one I didn't like and gave it to my friend) and by the sounds of it everyone I was with had a nice time. I'm going to give 3 stars because I probably wouldn't chose Under the Stairs again if I were to choose where to eat in Edinburgh. It was nice but not great.",

We're pretty jaded by snobby, rude service in Los Angeles (Santa Monica, Venice, etc.) so we were especially surprised at how trendy this place seemed to be and yet, the servers were so damn friendly.  They seemed very concerned that we were comfortable, made sure we didn't order more than we could eat (so we didn't waste money).  The cocktails were interesting and delicious.  There's plenty for vegetarians and vegans (and it's not old school veggie like you get at Henderson's - these vegetarian/vegan dishes are made with care and have layers of flavor).  Try the cheese or vegetarian board. It'll provide good noshable treats that'll easily fill you up and it's great for sharing.  This is a total \"recommend\" for any tourist.

    "text": "Really nice people.  We ordered the lamb.  It was a grilled cut of leg.  So, it was a little tough.  That cut might do better to be roasted or braised rather than cut off the leg and grilled.  The beer list wasn't bad.  We got the honey & sesame prawn tostada.  We were expecting grilled prawns on a tostada.  However, it is actually a tostada flavored like prawn, the way that prawn potato chips are.  The meal was only so-so.  I would give them another chance.",

    "text": "This is the kind of place I love. Rustic cozy atmosphere, hip, but none too complicated cocktails, quality food, not ridiculously expensive.   Started with olives and a whisky sour made with the bartenders choice whisky. In the USA we usually have a whiskey sour (bourbon) but this Scottish version tasted really good- mellowed with the egg white. Highly recommended. The olives, both black and green, were amazingly flavored, and the serving size was ample to share.   For dinner I ordered the duck confit, and they easily substituted potatoes for rice. The duck melted in my mouth (duck is my favorite dish!!!) and the sauce flavored the green beans and rice well. I ordered an (expensive ) glass of Pinot noir with the duck as my cheeks were already red from a drinks session at the dragonfly and the whiskey sour. Overall no complaints about the meal, drinks, and atmosphere.   When the three of us got the bill, I did see a Questionable open drink sale charge that seemed phantom.   Additionally, there were some \"Strange Guinness tactics\" going on- someone ordered a Guinness and instead of taking it from the tap the bar tender poured it from a can and then stuck it under the Guinness tap for a while. Not sure what that was about.   Overall I would definitely return to this gem under the stairs for a good drinks and eating session.",

    "text": "Some time ago I used to like this place, even though its drinks are clearly overpriced. Yet when on a Saturday you decide to go for a drink a bit past the midnight and the place is half full, you certainly don't expect the extremely unprofessional and rude behavior of its staff who only wanted to kick out everyone at 00.55 am. Just next to us there was a table full of people who had just ordered their beers (even though they claim to have last call for drinks at 12.30am they were very willing to serve them just to kick them out minutes later). Especially a rude waitress kept on coming on the tables asking all of us to get out. I suggest that the people pay only half of their drinks if they are kicked out before finishing them. Only during the festival season, all of sudden they extend their hours to accommodate the tourists? Sorry Under the stairs, but never again.  P.s. poor selection of draught beers too. :(",

Fast forward to the present and we came back to find it as good as we remembered. Friendly and attentive service, great drinks and very good food (little bites, medium bites and full sized mains) make this a find in Edinburgh. Now all you have to do is to find it Under the Bridge! When you do don't forget to order the sweet potato fries. You won't regret it.",

It's not that we wouldn't have rewarded the servers, but it made me feel targeted as an American.  I can't tell you if they add the charge to everyone's bill or not.  I can say it was not our normal experience in Edinburgh to have the service charge added.",

    "text": "I came here on the recommendation of a friend of mine who used to study in Edinburgh, and I'm so glad we went! We were there on New Years day and it was absolutely packed! Service was a bit slow, but it was no doubt just because there were so many people packed in there. I mean, it WAS one of the few restaurants open on New Years Day.   I went with the Miso Salmon salad and my husband went with the lamb steak. Both were fantastic. My salmon was quite filling, but still left me feeling like I'd eaten something good and healthy. My husband's lamb steak was cooked PERFECTLY and it was so full of flavour. I will definitely be coming back here the next time we're in edinburgh.",
