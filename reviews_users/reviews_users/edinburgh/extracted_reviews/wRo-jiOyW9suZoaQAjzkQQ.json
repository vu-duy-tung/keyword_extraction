I had the leek and potato soup... with pipers wild rosemary and thyme crisps.... just amazing..",

    "text": "We typically avoid cafes in tourist attractions, but we were at the Edinburgh Castle and we really needed to eat since it was 1 p.m. and we had to stay on schedule. So we stopped into the Red Coat Cafe and were actually pleasantly surprised.  While it's not cheap, we ordered two bowls of soup (6 each), a ham/cheddar baguette (5), a vegetable pizza (7.50), a smoothie (2.80), and two bottles of water (1.80 each) for a total of 30.90. The quality of the food was good enough that we didn't begrudge the relatively hefty price. If you must eat while you're at the Edinburgh Castle, at least you'll eat well.",

    "text": "This is a great place to stop in for a nice hot bowl of soup or a drink while visiting Edinburgh Castle. The service is buffet style so there are plenty of choices of pizza, hot dishes, sandwiches and a whole table of dessert. I enjoyed the potato leek soup and an Edinburgh beer and I would recommend both. The only down side is it is first come table availability and service is limited but I would return. The decor of the \"Red Coats Coming\" is a plus and brings the castle and history to life!",

    "text": "There were seven of us traveling together for family vacation. It is hard to find something that everyone wants to eat and agrees on. We had just finished touring throughout the castle and were hungry so it was out of convenience that we went there. We are Americans and it was a cafeteria style eatery which is good because we have so many people in our group. You take a tray, go up to the counter and order food displayed behind glass barrier, get the plate with food and then pay at the end.   The customer service was lousy. I have worked in catering for over 15 years, so I know what it's like to get crappy customers who are picky, rude and downright mean. Despite all of that, you still need to maintain your composure. Well the girl that was serving us did not get that memo.  The deal was if you get a main dish you had your pick of 2 sides.  She never said anything to my sister or husband about that so they only got one thing. She slammed the plate down on the counter when she finished dishing out the food and her face was angry.  My dad had asked her what a certain food was because we did not know and we wanted to make sure it was vegetarian. She rudely replied \"it's a plant so it's vegetable.\"   The salmon was seasoned well. There are plenty vegetarian soups which were amazing. The cheese pizza my kids ate was good and so was the portion size. The salad was fresh.  The cooked carrots and potatoes were delicious.   The rating merely reflects the attitude of the worker there because the food was good.",

Because it is inside the castle, everything was really expensive and portion size was small. We got several entrees like Grilled Salmon, vegetarian pasta etc.",

    "text": "Great little cafe to sit and have a slice of cake, coffee and/or beer.  After touring the castle, our tour guide told us that the lemon drizzle cake is to die for.  We headed in to find a new love; however, they did not have it.  We opted for the carrot cake instead, a Scottish beer and a coffee.  There is ample seating in the area and the views are amazing.  We were able to talk to one another as it wasn't that crowded and thoroughly enjoy our beverages, cake and view.  Prices weren't bad.",

    "text": "Honestly this place is gorgeous! 5 stars just for the amazing views! Wow, talk about a surprise.   We were out for a nice family outing on a very cold January day. We are historic Scotland members so hopping up to the castle for a wee wander is always an option if we feel like it.  The castle is gorgeous and on this day it was exceptionally cold so we took refuge in this wee cafe. The cafe looks wee on the outside but is actually very large with two large rooms.   The front room is divided into hot food to the right and a cafe island with muffins, cookies and sweets in the center. The hot food looked delicious and all very good quality. Lots of lovely fresh food to choose from, including sandwiches, hot homemade pies, chicken goujons, fish fingers, roasted vegetables. All made fresh from scratch!   When you enter into the second room you are greeted by lovely wooden chairs, tables and breath taking views overlooking different parts of Edinburgh. We had hot chocolates and blueberry muffins with a priceless view of princes garden and new town. The muffins were delicious and the seating was very comfortable.   If you are going to visit the castle I definitely recommend stopping into this cafe for lunch or dinner or a coffee break. You won't be disappointed.",
