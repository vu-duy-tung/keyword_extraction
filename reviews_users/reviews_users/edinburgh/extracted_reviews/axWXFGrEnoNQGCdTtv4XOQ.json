    "text": "What a lovely little Italian restaurant! We originally intended on eating at Nando's but due to the wait time we ended up here. I'm glad we did. The food is delicious and the service was great. I loved seeing the owner around, helping out.  At one point during the meal, my husband dropped his napkin and the bar tender saw, immediately picked it up and brought us some new ones without us saying a word. I was impressed.   Overall, I would recommend this restaurant.",

I have to say the service was top notch.   We all enjoyed our dinners very much.  My little guy really enjoyed his pizza and we all grabbed a quick bite of crust - bakery quality.  My wife and I enjoyed our Penne and Pollo Panna.  We don't always get dessert but went the whole way tonight.  I am not a huge tiramisu fan - I like it well enough.  My wife likes it more than I do.  But I have to say this tiramisu was very very good.   Our little ones enjoyed their dessert also.  With the great wine we had I would say this was a very enjoyable dinner.   Not sure if we would get the chance to go again due to travel plans,  but we would surely return if time allowed.  It was very flavorful!",

    "text": "What a great place!  We were in town for one more night and everything was booked up. We figured take out would be best and pizza sounded right. We looked up the menu online, made decisions and I went to order.   I was enthusiastically greeted by the owner, who was happy to take my order. We ordered three pizzas, lasagna and the crostini for a starter. Everything was delicious.    We got one of the eggplant (aubergine) / mushroom, one prosciutto / arugula (rocket) and one chef special with chorizo / ham / egg. All of them were distinctive, fresh, perfectly prepared and delicious. It was way more good than we needed, but we finished the leftover pizza the next morning.   At 45 for the whole meal it was an incredible value.   Unfortunately we are off to Glasgow today, otherwise we would be back and eat in the restaurant.",

    "text": "After coming back from Milan I still wanted Italian food so I figured I'd give this place a go. The restaurant is near the Odeon cinema on Lothian so not too difficult to find. I thought there would be folks eating there by 8pm but my friend and I were the only customers there. We got a bottle of prosecco for 23 and it was pretty good.   The menu isn't extensive and is pretty generic. You won't find anything out of the ordinary here and is pretty much just pasta and sauce. They did have gnocchi and that's what I was craving so I ended up ordering it. The dish was ok... Was put in a grill in tomato sauce with melted cheese on top. There wasn't much flavour going on and the tomato sauce was probably from a can or box. I guess I couldn't really be picky since it was only 8.  I checked out the dessert menu and it was pretty generic as well. Had some weird combination of sweets. I was going to try their tirimisu but honestly after I ate the pasta I said I better not lol... So I just enjoyed the prosecco and the company.   The waitress was super nice. She kept making sure we were ok and I'd say that was the best thing going on for the place... Well and the fresh cracked peppers lol. I guess it was my bad for choosing the place especially since I jus came back from Italy but lessons learned!",

    "text": "I was SO READY to love Frizzante, but I left disappointed in almost every way.  Italian food is my absolute favourite, but I'm not snobby about it. Give me a semi-comfortable atmosphere, a large glass of quaffable plonk and a plate full of that cheesy, creamy goodness and I'm as happy as a pig in proverbial. I am not hard to please! But Frizzante fell short of my very modest standards.  The first thing you may notice in Frizzante is that there's no obvious spot to wait at the entrance. It's very narrow, with the open kitchen immediately to your right. My wife and I hovered awkwardly by the door for some minutes, unsure what to do. The kitchen staff were frenetically plating up, not looking at us. If we had proceeded further inside, we would have been standing uncomfortably close to people trying to eat. We caught the eye of at least three different waiters several times, who saw us standing there and then roundly ignored us. Not even a \"I'll be with you in a minute\" or anything.  After three or four maddening minutes, a gentleman showed us to our table. Walking through the dining room you notice that it's VERY cramped inside. It's not a big restaurant and they have really packed the tables and seats in there. We were basically pushing past people to make our way through the room and my wife had to hand me her bag to fit by the table adjacent to ours otherwise she would have sent their wine flying.  The atmosphere is about as warm and inviting as an operating theatre. The lights are bright, the decor is plane and characterless and the music is awful. There is a set of huge mirrors along one wall to try to make the room feel less claustrophobic, but it instead forces you to confront the grizzly image of yourself stuffing pasta into your mouth and removes any sense of cosiness that the dining room otherwise might have had.  We had been seated no longer than ten seconds when our waitress was already asking what we wanted to drink. I asked if we could look at the menu first, so she came back maybe 30 seconds later. We ordered a bottle of white wine, which came in a giant plastic 'ice' bucket that actually was full of water with no discernible ice and did nothing more functional than take up about 75% of the tiny table. We were then harried to order so quickly that I caved to the mounting social pressure, panicked and picked a random thing from the menu that I instantly regretted.  So anyway, the food was not bad. Not great, but fine. My randomly chosen order was gnocchi, which was very salty, somewhat small and a little 'meh' but I certainly ate it all. The missus had some veggie pasta, which tasted very acceptable but really nothing better than I would make at home with my extremely humble abilities.  With so many great Italian places in Edinburgh, I doubt I will be back to Frizzante.",

    "text": "Having I think been in here once many years ago when it was still Lazio's I can't say I'd ever really given it much thought since, it was just one of those restaurants that seem to have been around forever & likely to continue as such. As the Japanese place across the road was oddly closing at 9pm, however, Frizzante got our business at the start of December and that proved to be a good choice.  The crostini starter was attractively presented & a pleasing size. The two different risottos ordered (funghi misti & al martin) were also great in terms of taste & portion size whilst the tirmisu was doorstep size & the panacotta enjoyably firmer than anticipated.  As mentioned by an earlier reviewer the restaurant was very clean and the service was friendly and attentive throughout. Once I've visited again I would imagine a fifth star will be the order of the day.",

We had a wonderful experience that ended with my 12 year old proclaiming this was the BEST pizza he had ever eaten anywhere in the world and wanted to know if we could buy frozen pizzas to take home to the United States with us.  The service we received from our delightful waitress Olivia was off the charts.  She took time and talked with us about Edinburgh and made some great recommendations on things to _not_ miss.  We were made to feel welcome, and when we needed to order more pizza, Olivia got it to us in under 10 minutes.  Frizzante made a great impression on my whole family and we will definitely return when we are back in Edinburgh in the future.",

Got the pizza norcina which was rather unremarkable as the Italian sausage used was pretty bland. The pizza dough base was between mediocre and adequate, which should not be happening if you're using the proper recipe & proper ingredients. All in all a positive experience due to the very attentive waitress.",
