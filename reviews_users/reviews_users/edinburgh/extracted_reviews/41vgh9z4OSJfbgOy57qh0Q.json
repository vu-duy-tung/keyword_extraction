    "text": "We had breakfast here every morning whilst staying at the Waldorf Astoria and it was great! Only downer was our last morning when we couldn't get a table but had to sit in peacock alley. This meant we had to carry out food to a low table and found it harder to get the attention of staff for coffee etc.  We dined in the Galvin one night and having not booked a table, we were given one at the side of the bar.  Deciding on having the seafood platter and few extras my friend asked if some of it could be served warm and some cold, the manager said they could. It did take a while for food to arrive. Though I'm no expert on seafood, I tried to eat as much as I could and it was fine. I just think we needed a bigger table, look for my photo to see what I mean!! Ha ha  We had the souffle for dessert and it was lovely!!!",

However, we seemed to get a different waiter for each course or drink we ordered, meaning we often had to ask for things twice or were asked the same thing multiple times. Having less staff per table would have made for a more personal experience. The prices here are quite expensive as well, so it's nice for a special occasion but too much to become regulars here.",

    "text": "Ok so it was a Tuesday evening but the restaurant was empty and as such had little atmosphere. The cold cabinet that in the publicity is packed full of oysters, crab claws lobster tails and prawns and looked really appetising had hardly anything in it.  When the menu arrived its brevity was apparent. Specialisation can be a good thing when it leads to excellence but can also be limiting in terms of variety! That said my flank steak was perfectly cooked and full of flavour. The skinny chips are not a favourite of mine but the French beans were well cooked and well seasoned. Wines were fine as well. On the whole I enjoyed it and the price was OK at 50 per head. I guess I just expected something more for all of the hype and publicity about the place. The staff were very friendly and rescued what would have been a disappointing evening.",

    "text": "The best and worst I can say about the Brasserie is that it's absolutely ordinary.  Pompadour, Brasserie's sister restaurant in the Caledonian, didn't have any open spots--or any spots at all--so we book reservations at Brasserie. Keep in mind that, As I mentioned in my review for the Caledonian, we were promised \"that [we would be] given nothing but the finest service tonight at the Brasserie.\"   We were seated quickly enough. The decor is pretty standard modern restaurant fare: medium-dark woods, blue booths, some glass surfaces. Disappointingly, there were no tablecloths.  The menu is also ordinary. From the grill, there were steak and seafood entrees. There were some Scottish- and French-influenced dishes outside the grill. My wife chose from the \"gazpacho\" and the sea bream from two-course prix fixe menu, while I chose a steak and an appetizer.  My appetizer, the escargot, was fine--escargot in butter and garlic is a common dish, and this was pretty well executed. The gazpacho, while reasonably tasty, was not at all a gazpacho. Instead, it was a few halved cherry tomatoes in a very, very clear broth. I can't fathom why they decided to call it a gazpacho, but I guess that's not my call.  We both enjoyed--but were not blown away by--our entrees. The fish's standout element was the grain mixture underneath. My fillet was good, but it wasn't any better than I'd get in, say, Kansas City or Chicago or New York.  The apricot souffle was a standout, although, as noted below, it took forever to get it ordered.    Our selections from the rather spartan wine list ranged from quite nice to quite unappealing. My wife's white (sorry, I can't remember the varietal or blend or region) was lovely. My pinot noir was passable, if young. My wife's cabernet sauvignon was close to swill. My Pedro Ximenez sherry was fine, if not particularly noteworthy. Of note, the menu says that the full Pompadour wine was available, but given the blowback I received vis-a-vis Pompadour over the recent few days--it was almost like I screamed Voldemort's name out loud--I didn't want to chance it.  Service was shoddy. Whilst we were seated quickly, everything else moved at a snail's pace. Maybe they were mourning the death of the six snails I consumed. I don't know. But nonetheless, it took forever to take our order. My wife didn't receive her second glass of wine, should have come with her main course, until we were almost finished with dinner. The server knew this, too, as she apologized for forgetting it. While dessert orders were taken relatively quickly, I almost needed a bullhorn to get a server's attention to get the cheque.   In all: The service isn't great. The food is pretty good, but it's nothing you can't get elsewhere, with better service and better atmosphere.",

Would not probably recommend imam with yoghurt for starters - it was a bit hard to eat as there was very little bread. The service was a little below par for a venue of this level in terms of knowledge but they made up for it in enthusiasm.",

However, the meal itself didn't really stand out. The starter was a chicken roulade with roasted vegetables - the presentation and the vegetables were excellent but the roulade wasn't that flavourful. For the main I had coley on a bed of mashed potatoes. The fish was fine and the dish came together well, but compared to other places I wasn't blown away. The yogurt pane cotta and the cheese course were both wonderful. Overall, the meal was lovely, especially for what we paid on a voucher. However, if paying full price I would have given it three stars since the service was also very slow and not that attentive.",

    "text": "Take a bow chaps.....you deserve it. Since announcing their intention to make a move to Edinburgh the Galvin Brothers have gone straight at it with a drive and determination that seems sure to land them their latest Michelin star for the fine dining restaurant The Pompadour by Galvin.  With the Brasserie and the Pompadour nestled within the newly refurbished Caley Hotel or as they like to call it The Caledonian, A Waldorf Astoria Hotel, they have brought the city centre standard up a notch. Now in Scotland we are well known for liking what we know - we are inherently scared/challenged by things/people we don't know. Enter stage left Executive Chef Craig Sandle once of the Balmoral, and General manager will be Dale Dewsbury, who previously spent 10 years at the two-Michelin-starred Restaurant Andrew Fairlie at Gleneagles. If ever there was a Fantasy Football style pairing to open a restaurant in Scotland who understand the clientele this is it.  So being the resident foodie in my office I was tasked with organising the works Christmas party, now when I think of any menu that's starts Christmas or Festive it invariably means the usual pre-theatre or *cough* 'market menu' *cough* bumped up in price with a turkey dish added and an extra 10 on the price.  Not so here, for a very reasonable 24 you could enjoy a lovely 3 course menu. For me as soon as I read the menu there could only be one choice for starter, Foie Gras Parfait, Pear and Raisin Chutney, Toasted Sour Dough. Hmmmmm. As soon as I read Foie Gras I am sold! This dish was light, rich and indulgent all in one. With the stunning presentation it was a great way to start the meal.  For mains I went for the Confit Chicken Leg, Brussel Sprouts, Bacon and Chestnuts, Pomme Mousseline. Soft, succulent chicken, salty bacon, woody chestnuts......butter mash.....what man wouldn't love this dish! In fact no foodie wouldn't love this dish. A real alternative Christmas dinner with some wonderful winter flavours.  To finish...yet more indulgence :) Baked Banana Parfait, Dark Chocolate Cremeux. The parfait was so light and still packed with so much flavour - with the dark chocolate setting it off worked perfectly.  Added to this we have a few bottles of a lovely Cote du Rhone making a perfect foodie Christmas meal. The staff, the service, the food....all top notch. The Galvins have added a real touch of class to our city and long may it continue.  The Galvin Brasserie de Luxe comes highly JD Recommended!",

I hadn't heard from anyone that had been to the restaurant before, but had visited the hotel and restaurant briefly a few weeks prior. And was kind of happy to take a punt given some of the prior yelperonis.  The food was phenomenal. I'm going to say the best Sunday lunch I've had in Scotland. The service was as you would expect from Hiltons WA brand, exceptional, attentive and receptive. The price was in my opinion too reasonable for the quality of the food and service.   The manager and the hotel managers should be proud of the Brasserie FOH and BOH teams.  I will be back, very soon ...",

Let's start with the decor, it's relatively warming, though a little sterile. Some tables look less welcoming than others, but the best seats in the house are at the u shaped bar. They have a shellfish display there which will make any seafood lover lose control.  I always have the steak tartare, and it is amazing, though if know this isn't for everyone's taste. Last time I went I had the whole plaice, with brown shrimps, which really was special. It was perfectly cooked and slipped off the bone, in a really light oil dressing, with capers, shallots and lemon juice - I'm salivating writing this.   Service is always totally professional, which is to be expected of a restaurant carrying the name of the Galvin Brothers.  I don't have any kids, but if I did I would take them here for lunch on Sundays, why? Because there eat for free!!!",

It really is mightily impressive, with some masterful cooking on show. I look forward to my next visit, as I'm keen to share the place with others, so they can get a dose of pure culinary class.\"",

    "text": "The two words that sum this place up for me are 'fancy' and 'rich'.  It's a much more 'fancy'  than the type of place I'm used to and very much has an air of fine dining. That said, it's not what I would consider really expensive either.  The menu was a little bit of a challenge with much of it being in French, however I don't necessarily see that as a problem and the staff were more than happy to help.   As for 'rich', this is basically how I'd describe all the dishes I had. Again, not in a bad way, but just massively rich and full of flavour. Certainly not something I could eat often, and I didn't require much else for the rest of the day either!  My starter of blue cheese salad was liberally covered with a creamy dressing. A good portion with lots of flavour.  Duck and black pudding with a side of mash (I can't remember the proper French name) went down very well as a main. Again it was amazingly rich, which felt like it should have put me off, but it was hard not to clean up the plate.  A pudding of minted chocolate with icecream (I'm sure they had a much more fancy name) finished me off. Again very rich, but clean tasting at the same time (if that makes any sense).   All in all a great experience, but one I'll wait a while before repeating in order to continue fitting into my clothes!",

    "text": "This place is so pretty from the outside with the wrapping windows and the warm wood tones. One day I finally had time to stop in, and I got a bar table and ordered the tuna. It didn't say appetizer and for 9 I didn't think it would be, but there it came, three small medallions of tuna on some sparse but tasty pickled vegetables. It was really damn good, and I wanted more, but decided against spending 18 for a bit of tuna.   The staff were very nice.  When they said they could not do a soy latte they were cool about it, and I took a regular one. I was there for about an hour, and they didn't pressure me.  Stay classy Galvin.  They do have wireless, though they say it is spotty, which is True.",

The cold section offers smoked salmon, brie and other assorted cheeses.  They also have a cereal bar.  The hot food was traditional scottish fare and some pancakes.  You can also order from their regular menu and they have children's chairs.  Great and surprising buffet at a lovely hotel.",

    "text": "aw i'm so pleased that my 100th review goes to such a fabulous place!!  Galvin Brasserie de Luxe was my valentines day surprise dinner venue and it was just so perfect.... the food, the wait staff, the atmosphere, the food OMG......  after reading Blythe R's review of this newly re-opened restaurant i had mentioned to the boyfriend that it might be a fabulous place to try.  i have to say he was quite clever because i mentioned this months ago and yet last night this is where he lead me to for dinner.  we were greeted by a very nice host who took our coats and showed us to our table.  the restaurant is fairly large for a fine dining location but i think this relates to the fact is it part of the newly restored waldorf-astoria caledonian hotel.  and even with the size, it felt very french bistro chic with a cosy atmosphere that was accented with soft blues and dark browns and the black and white tiled floor.  we both noted that there was no music, however, instead of a draw back i found this quite pleasing as it allowed us to chat without having to shout over any loud music and the chatter of the tables around us created a really lively environment.  while the restaurant itself is lovely, it's really the food that is the star of the show!  we were offered both an a la carte menu and a valentines day menu, we opted for the later as it was three courses including a kir royale and a coffee with petit fours at the end. (incredibly good value at 39!, but i noticed there was no veggie option so maybe best to check if they could do that for the veggie people out there).  i started with a smoked salmon ravioli over juilenne carrots and radish with a creamy sauce.  i apologise that this description is rather lacking but i can't recall the menu description well and it's not on their website.  but i can assure you that this dish was delicious!  the smoked salmon was offset by the crispy veg that had a slighty asian type of taste and as much as i tried to savour this dish it was sooooooo tasty i sort of just shoved it all in my mouth as quickly as i could while taking sips from a very nice white wine.  next was the mains and we both opted for the duck breast over savoury cabbage with apple.  OMG just OMG really.  the duck was sooooooo tender and juicy with a nice crisp skin that went perfectly with the red cabbage that had a wee bit of spice in it.  and then the apples mmmmmm these were cooked to just slightly soft but still crisp and had a lovely sweetness to go with the cabbage and duck.  we'd also added a side of pomme dauphiosse (apology for the awful spelling) that was heaven in creamy potatoes.  i was only a bit annoyed we opted to share this as it was sooooooooo delicious i probably could have eaten all the potato goodness on my own.  and lastly dessert, if there was any way to end this delectable meal it was with the passionfruit souffle with raspberry coulis.  just... i have no words.  it was amazing.  the souffle just melted in my mouth and the taste of passionfruit was delightlfully strong and punchy and i struggled to savour it as i just wanted to eat it all up immediately.  it was just beautiful, that's the best way to describe it.  i also got a bite of the boy's chocolate mousse which was darkly chocolate-y and very luxurious.  we finished up with an espresso for him and a tea for me and some homemade fudge and pineapple jelly like sweets.  the whole meal was just wow.  the food was AMAZINGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!  and the service was very prompt without being intrusive or making us feel rushed.  i also really adored the sommelier, who was a lovely french girl that was so sweet and helpful.  the atmosphere felt lovely and it was just a really wonderful fine dining experience.  i cannot recommend this place enough!!! and hope that my boyfriend sees fit to treat me to dinner here again soon :) :)",
