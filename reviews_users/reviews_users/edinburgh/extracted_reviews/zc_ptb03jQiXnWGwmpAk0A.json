The main bar is ornately decorated, but unfortunately usually full of people pretending they're in Sex and The City (this is not my scene, but I know that a lot of people get off on this, so by all means, head on down - Carrie and the gang will be along in 5). The other room, I shall refer to it as the function room (this makes it sound a bit like a miner's social club circa 1976), is almost gothic in its decor, i.e. black and moody with chandeliers. I've attended a few uni  do's here and it is an ideal space for those sorts of shindigs; there are tables around the edge of the room, a good sized dance floor in the middle and a stage at one end. To sum up, I wouldn't come here for drinks, but I will put it on my list of possible wedding reception venues.",

The food was probably the worst part of the evening but that's not saying it was bad, just a bit average when compared to everything else. And the table service for drinks suffered hugely once the bar became busier meaning we had to go to the bar to order our drinks on a few occasions. But all in all we had a very enjoyable evening and would definitely go back.",

We're talking sleek, black leather booths, ornate decor, separate rooms partitioned off by moss green velvet curtains, bay windows and a massive bar. They have so much booze it should be illegal. Absinthe is on the menu, and their rum selection looks like it's been sold to them by pirates.  Very, very fancy, I can see why this is the venue of choice for Burlesque nights. It is however relaxed during the day, and you can roll in looking like shit since no one bats an eyelid. But the occasion would call for a fancy cocktail dress and a boyfriend with slicked back hair and a waistcoat on. It's simply delightful.",

Fortunately the tune is harder to get stuck in your head. But I definitely like VR. The furnishings are classy and the bartenders are smooth in their delivery of your cocktail of choice. I've always visited at awkward times - like after a Fringe matinee (as they hosted a venue last year), or part of a lazy afternoon drinking session, so I have never had the experience of a crowded bar. It feels like my kinda place.   As with the Fringe venue, it seems that VR hosts a variety of events - including a disastrous quiz that accompanied my last visit (thank goodness it was for charity as no one else benefited from that mess!). It also provides the opportunity to check out some Burlesque in this city - absolutely - just show me the way and shame on me for not already attending!",

    "text": "The ratings for The Voodoo Rooms seem to be mostly positive based on the drinks and ambience. So if that is what you are looking for, this is potentially a good place for you.   HOWEVER. The food, based on my one meal, was terrible. I started with the Haggis spring rolls. These honestly I didn't have much of a problem with, mostly because I have nothing to compare them to and had no expectations. (Never had Haggis before this). I personally didn't like the Haggis, but that probably doesn't have much to do with the preparation and instead is just the nature of the beast. Literally....  What I can more properly comment on is the main course I had, which was sea bass. I strongly advise that you do NOT order this dish here. The fish was thin and tasteless, served dark side up. Very unappetizing, even by sight. The side rice was plain, white, and very dry.   I had a draft beer which was rather good, and the cocktail list looked impressive. My recommendation is to stick to the drinks at the Voodoo Rooms and eat your meal elsewhere.",

The ceiling is certainly something to behold from underneath cocktail infused eyes, with its regal gold and black trim. This place is going for a look of opulence and cocktail class mixed up with a bit of edge, and I like it.  There are four main sections of Voodoo Rooms, the long, sleek main bar with its padded booth seating, and an awesome vintage looking restaurant section. There's also the Speakeasy and the Ballroom Bar, which can both be hired for private functions, and are a really brilliant call for such extravaganzas. I've been to a few private parties in the Speakeasy, and it really works, as it's not too big, but you've got enough room to fit a decent amount of people in it. The food is decent, the cocktail menu is even better, and the people that come here generally look brilliant, so it's a bit of a visual style treat I usually find, and I love a bit of fashion peeping. This is somewhere a bit different to come in the New Town, and as well as having live bands in and cabaret performances, it also hosts the well established and loved Vegas nights, which you have to hit up if you're in town for a while.",

    "text": "Voodoo Rooms, a very cool name for a quite swish bar.   I came here for the Son of Dave gig last year and I was impressed. Set on a rather dingy side street in New Town you walk up some stairs and enter the rather fancy bar. The bartenders know their art, and despite the slightly pricey drinks (you are in New Town now) it's good quality drinks. The comfy booths make it great for company and privacy as well.  On with the music venue. We walked in and there's a massive disco ball in the middle (tick) and fairy lights all over the walls (double tick). However, this was a dumb venue for this gig. The stage (if you can call it that) is literally a step up from the floor. Son of Dave beatboxes and messes about the stage a lot, meaning only the three front rows of standing people can see what's going on. If you are in the back good luck with that. Also, the musicians have to walk through the crowd to get to the stage. Double awkward if they are trying to squeeze through a packed room.  The thing that did make a difference though compared to other gigs , is that at the end there were no harsh lights switched on and angry security guards yelling at us to get out. It was a lot more civilised, and we weren't rushed out of the room for the next event to start.   I will be coming back here in the near future (hopefully) and maybe my impression of it as a music venue changes. In the mean time, check out the bar, it's a great place to start your night in New Town.",

The dazzeling faux night sky of the main ballroom now has bulbs missing, the gorgeous leather booths have backs peeling away and even the porceline tiger is now missing a tooth.  In any other bar this slow delapidation would render its attempt at grandiosity doomed to failure but the voodoo roooms wears its age with more than a little pride.    When empty on a Sunday the rooms feel relaxing withou being slovenly and when full the joy vivre of its patrons mask any imperfection with an abandon that speaks volumes to the strength of the the drinks on offer and the skill of the musicians, dj's and in some cases simple Ipod selections playing as backdrop.  When you,ve grown tired of the George street cocktail bars and suspect that your growing too old for the club scene I would reccomend that you take 3 or 4 friends to the Voodoo rooms and discover that a change of scene can work wonders.",

If only it didn't close at 1am you could probably have your entire night out in the one place.   Situated above the Cafe Royal the very well stocked bar makes great use of its period features with black walls and gold cornices and a DJ in the corner plays tunes that add to ambience without forcing you to raise your voice to have a conversation.   The huge selection of spirits indicates that mixed drinks are a speciality here and I've never been dissapointed yet.  It make a pleasant change to be able to order a spirit without having it poured into an inappropriately sized glass and drowned in whatever mixer is chosen.   Whilst entry to the bar is free of charge the DJs and live acts perform in the ballroom for an additional fee. The room boasts a good souns system and a decent sized dancefloor. Get in early if you want to bag a table though!",

Not quite what I expected from the name, the ceilings resemble more of an Imperial Russian palace with its black and gold decor but wow  what a transformation.   The booths are a great feature of the bar if you want to take a seat. There is the option to go into the Ballroom and get on the dancefloor if you pay an admission price otherwise you can just enjoy the buzz of the bar for the cost of a drink (or two!). The ballroom is a lovely room, quite contrasting to the main bar with its twinkly lights adorning the walls giving it a cabaret feel.   All in all, a great looking bar with a relaxed crowd at the weekend. There is a great atmosphere here. The only downside for the ladies on a Friday or Saturday night is the epic winding journey through a packed bar to the other end of the room for the ladies room! Oh and its only open til 1am, when the night is so young!...",

This visit was great as Voodoo provided a nice little array of canapes and cocktails for the Elite event!   I really should get a group of friends to meet here as i think it would kick off a great evening before moving along!",

It's tucked away in a nice little corner which mean there not many people just wandering in off the street and yet there still a nice mix of people inside.

    "text": "The Voodoo Rooms shouldn't be a two star establishment, but is gets two stars for the experience as a whole.  Years ago when it first opened, I came here for a meal with my parents, intrigued by the supposed creole-inspired food.  We paid top prices for middle of the line food.  I've been a number of times since (wisely staying away from the food and coming here only for drinks), and while I find the drinks reasonable, I think that the quality of the cocktails has gone downhill since the opening.    The thing is, the biggest draw about the Voodoo Rooms is the setting.  It's gorgeous, opulent, and entirely too good for most of the clientele.  We were there this past weekend and were jostled, man-handled, and Katie Priced by what felt like every person walking into the bar.  This is partially because, while the venue as a whole is quite large, the actual main bar is very small for the number of people it attracts.  When I'm paying top dollar in such a nice (looking) bar, I just don't expect such a crush or rude and ridiculous people.  So, the Voodoo Rooms could be a much nicer place (food aside) but it is unfortunately let down by the kind of crowd it attracts.",

    "text": "Edinburgh Blues Club with special guests Gerry Jablonski and The Electric Band & Lights Out By Nine Friday 27th March 2015 7:00pm  On my third visit to The Edinburgh Blues Club (EBC) at the Voodoo Rooms and the following has definitely increased along with its success.  I was happy to see there was improved seating and table arrangements, but there were still not enough chairs to meet demand.     First up for the night were the Fifers, Lights Out By Nine who play powerhouse rhythm and blues, funk and soul and have developed a collection of their own original songs.  Signed by River Records they have released four original albums: \"Moving On\" along with a live set titled \"The River Sessions,\" \"Good Morning Mr Universe\" and \"Make Your Own Luck\".  The bands front man is a new addition to the crew, long time friend and reputable soul and blues man - John Frame, who is accompanied by band members Alan Kyle, Dougie Hunter, George Morrison, Graham Key, John Beresford, Paul Haddow, Tom Stirling and Arthur Cook.   The first thing that struck me when Lights Out By Nine started playing was John Frame's powerful voice, he belted out clear lyrics with a gravelly husky edge.  Supporting Frame was guitar, bass, drums, trumpets and saxophone.  The groovy tunes flowed. The horns provided tremendous fanfare solos. 'It went all down the drain' provided a mellow interlude before their self-proclaimed funkicology track; the guitarist provided most of the cheerful banter and encouraged the audience to take to the dance floor.  The shy audience remained in place, but there was definitely some shuffling on spot and bouncing heads!  'How long' allowed Frame to master gruff vocals which was married well with the almost feminine soft backing vocals from the guitar, bass and keyboard player.  The guitarist admitted the set list was unplanned and the musicians discussed amongst themselves the order of play, but as a band they performed with ease and a relaxed manner, demonstrating a slick and professional ensemble.  'Laughing on the other side' was introduced as their devil music, followed by an amusing anecdote about performing it in a church.  They told us that it was not the first time they had crossed musical paths with tonight's headline act Gerry Jablonski and The Electric Band, they thanked them for the music gear but joked they would be getting it back!  It was explained that Frame doesn't talk much because \"he can't get a work in\" Frame interrupted, but he was actually just saving his singing voice the man with the chat - guitarist proclaimed! As time moved on and more drinks were sunk, member of the audience grew in confidence and filled the dance floor.  They finished on a funky number dedicated to James Brown, which really got people moving.  A belter of a band guaranteed to please.   After a brief interval for a raffle with an impressive set of blues CDs from past performers up for grabs, the headline act Gerry Jablonski and The Electric Band followed.  Aberdeen's longest standing and most gifted four-piece blues rock powerhouse band.  Front man Gerry has been a performing strong in the Scottish music scene for 30 plus years and his guitar playing is well treasured. Tragically founding member, drummer and dear friend, Dave Innes, lost his fight with cancer, but the band vowed to continue performing in his memory. Gerry's latest ensemble sees the new addition Polish blues harp phenomenon Pete Narojczyk and more recently young lad Lewis Fraser on drums who can sing too!  One member of the audience even jokingly heckled, \"he sings better than you Gerry!\"  Along with the bassist, Grigor Leslie they play original music in honor to the blues rock classics that have influenced this band.   From the start the band explode onto the stage, wowing the audience with their authentic gutsy performance. Jablonski has grown into an experienced, entertaining showman. The Edinburgh Blues Club saw him and the band giving it their all.  Jablonski's high-energy stage presence is mesmerising, he struts and strides across the stage, arms flailing and pulling tremendous facial expressions.  This comical character maintains enormous energy throughout the entire set, springing about like a newborn lamb!  The groovy music is complimented by the talented harmonica player, Narojczyk. Superb harmonica solo echoes around the ballroom filling the entire venue in soft warmth along with Jablonski's extensive guitar solos.  relaxed for a moment as drummer, Lewis Fraser sings a mellow number with just Jablonski on guitar to accompany him initially and then the drum, bass and harmonica followed on.  At one point between tracks, Jablonski increases the guitar volume and blows into the guitar strings, sending a soft strum to wave across the audience. It was good to see a number of die-hard fans in the audience knowing every lyric and relishing the performance. An encore was commanded and Jablonski finished with an impressive guitar solo.",

It's a plush looking bar, really nicely decorated. We had a private room for a party, which wasn't so plush looking, but was still great for what we wanted. We had our own bar with a friendly staff member, dancefloor which was all lit up, toilets, and we were able to hook up our own music (though this wasn't necessarily a good thing as whoever brought their music didn't have the best taste. It was also too loud when trying to talk to people). It was a good sized space aswell for a party and there was lots of seating though no one really used it. I got the impression from the main bar that it would be harder to get seats as it looked very busy but then again it was a Saturday night.  I definitely want to go back again in a few weeks when I've friends visiting from home and explore the other main areas of the Voodoo Rooms.",

The bar plays host to many events in it's two halls (main and speakeasy) these range from live music to comedy and cabaret. Having taken in a few shows here, the lighting and sound are well done supporting the acts that play here very well.  In terms of a cocktail/spirit bar they have an excellent selection, though I wouldn't go here to drink beer, here things are entirely generic... Do go here though if you feel like trying a different rum, gin, vodka or whisky or if you are simply in the mood for a cocktail.  I haven't tried the food here, so won't comment to much, though I will say I have looked enviously at some of the tables which have, if nothing else the food looks good.  So, while the Voodoo is opulent it never feels ostentatious, instead it is a lively fun-filled place to spend a few hours, take in a show and sample some nice spirits.",

I stumbled upon this place after a random late Thursday evening (23rd May ;) ) sticky toffee pudding hunting with my GF.   //  W R O N G   S I D E //  After driving up the, now one-way street before hand (left side of St Andrews Square as you exit George Street) to approach the venue [Crazy shizz I know], we walked up the stairwell with what I resembled to be the start of an a rollercoaster on space mountain or something. It could also could be referred to as what you might imagine your backstage entrance to \"Stars in Their Eyes\" would be like....or just some stairs with lights on the ceiling. It was cool though and got my mouth to stay open for about 20 seconds (health and safety issue with all my dessert craving drool on the steps but never mind!)    //  I N S I D E   &   S E R V I C E //  Inside it was quite lively and there was a good vibe and atmosphere. The clientele was mixed (old and young) but both of the more sophisticated nature. I had quickly researched this place online prior to us going and therefore had booked a table for our random Thursday Night Dessert OFF! so we had a table reserved. One thing was that we had to awkwardly wait for a couple of minutes, and then go up to the side of the bar and ask one of the staff members about the table we had booked as there was no one at the \"dolly waiter\" at that time. Anyway, we got seated and were presented with the menu and advised of the specials etc but then waited for the moment to break the script by saying that we were just in for dessert :)    The rest went a little like this:  --Received Dessert Menu, --Had seen it online, and ofcourse that they had sticky toffee pudding, --Ordered one of those and a New York Cheese Cake!  //  N E W   E X P E R I E N C E S //  One thing that was very simple but awsome as well was the jug of water we got for the table which had been marinated with a cucumber in it - YUM-YUM.  So sippin cucumber H2o, it was time to have a good look around from our table O~o  The interior decor was very vintage and royal with its sculptured ceilings and walls and hanging chandeliers. The dinning room we were in, next door to the bar, was modernly dated with that classy old vibe which was a change and the booths looked great for gatherings of friends. Instantly we planned to have our next night out here.  After going to the bathroom and having a flash back to the website, I noticed the array of events held in the venue. With private hire of venue space obviously available too! CMY EVENT THERE SOON I HOPE! :D  //  T I P S  //  --The prices are pretty reasonable for the atmosphere, the location and the quality of food. It was even better with a Gourmet Society Card offering 50% off! BOOM :D  --Arrive early for a booth, or call to reserve one.  --Thursday nights are busy.  --Sticky Toffee Pudding & New York Cheese Cake were amazing, mouth = watering  --You can rock up in anything casual but the majority of people were smart casual on a Thursday night.  Can't wait to go here for drinks and report back!",

I loved the decor which is luxurious and I (this might be a bit weird) liked that they had plants! It seems to evoke calm, despite the increasing drunkeness due to tequila consumption. I had started with tequila (well kind of, but the glass of wine first in Cafe Royal isn't counted) and stayed on the fab El Diablo cocktails but it appeared they had a good range of wines and spirits. Two El Diablo cocktails and a pint was around 14 - decent price for Glasgow or Edinburgh, especially when cocktails are involved and I definitely intend to return :-)",

A great buzz about the place for a Thursday night, really nice crowd and good tunes ...it's all about the tunes people!  I simply love the decor, which I know is not for everyone - it makes me feel as though I've stumbled into some crazy Versace painting (on acid) *  I'm looking forward to visiting Voodoo Rooms for their Vegas themed night - I love nothing more than an opportunity to get all dolled up, bring on the feather boas, dancing (on tables) & cocktails... hell yeah!  *NB - for the record, I have not tried or will ever try acid.  :-D",

I have attended a couple of events here, organised by students for charity. Both were enjoyable and made good use of the venue, which shows the versatility of the bar. There was food available which was actually pretty good considering it was pub food. The only down side is the drinks are rather expensive so if you are here for the night it's going to be an expensive one. I attended a gig here and it was very small and intimate, the style of the bar really added an extra dimension to the atmosphere too.  Voodoo Rooms does cool and stylish in a non pretentious way which is a welcome change from the trendy bars on nearby George Street.",

    "text": "I've been meaning to put a  review up for Voodoo Rooms for a wee while now.  To be honest this has been a favourite haunt of mine since it pretty much opened a few years back.  My mum remembers it as an old dance hall when she used to go out out at the Cafe Royal (another favourite of mine) when she was younger.  I would say most nights are good. If you fancy a relaxed drink a Sunday late afternoon is always good - and most nights are pretty busy. Friday nights are always good after work and into the evening!  They have lots of events on and they have the main room upstairs and the 'Speakeasy' half way down the stairs, which is a nice area. Both can be hired out for parties etc.  It's a lovely designed bar. A friend of mine actually helped put the fancy stickers up all over the place when it first opened. It has a great selection of drinks and weekly cocktail specials which are always worth a try.  The only thing that does put me off is that the staff can be pretty slow at times, especially if they have a large cocktail order on the go. It can also get really busy too, so it can be difficult to get a seat - but worth it if you can get in early on - as you get table service.  I'd also highly recommend their antipasti selection - the nicest selection I've had in a bar - and a lovely start to the night with a glass of prosecco!  If you haven't been. Go! :)    --",

Arriving around 13:00 I was pretty surprised to find that my companion and I were the only customers. Possibly people only see it as a good place for a night out (which it is) but given the attentive service, interesting choice of background music (jazz, soul, funk and the theme from The Good, The Bad & The Ugly) I'd suggest thaat those who already like it in the late hours should arrive earlier to fully appreciate all it has to offer.   The food itself was good. Whilst the 2 for 1 offer on the Full Scottish Breakfast couldn't be taken advantage of due to a wish to keep it light I would expect it's worth a return visit. The chicken, avocado and brie ciabatta was pronounced a success and a dangerous inhibitor of movement whilst my piri-piri tiger prawns were well presented and suitably spicy.   Stopped in here on April 1st as fancied comparing their bottle of booze at your table efforts. We were initially quoted 84 for a bottle of 42 Below vodka but that reduced to 75 when it turned out they'd no Belvedere available which seems to be the standard on offer. Mixers were by the carafe from the gun (or the can when we changed to Irn Bru later on) and unlimited as you'd expect. Given the amount of work the staff are saved by you doing all your own pouring and mixing the price is rather steep at 10 more than Monteith's but otherwise there's little to choose between the two.",

Well, if you're going to go strutting around to be judged, I'm here to judge you, pretties. And I've got to look beyond the good-looking surface to see if you really are beauty queens of substance.  Voodoo Rooms. Sexy name for sure, good start. Lots of black leather, big windows, swishy curtains, it's got a sleek sensual vibe but just the right amount of quirk to save it from any pretentiousness. Me likey. It's very comfortable and the staff, as well as the clientele, are friendly. In fact the customers here are a very mixed group, so no one's likely to feel out of place,and everyone we encountered there was very pleasant, from the kind souls who let us share their tables, to those we were kind souls to when we had one to ourselves and gave up a few seats. Hmm. It's interesting how honest complete strangers will be to you if you've all shared a few drinks. Procreation, I have to say, that's a new one - never been advised to do that over a few vodkas at a bar.  So far so good! Nice tunes, great vibe, shiny happy people holding hands, even the trips to the loos were excellent as for once going through a long narrow bar on a Saturday night didn't feel like running a gauntlet of lechery. Plus the ladies' room itself was actually very well-kept. Always a plus. So where's that fifth star? Well, the cocktails are extremely interesting, and they might be a bit *too* interesting for some. Myself and Chris are two people at opposite ends of the cocktail spectrum. I go for the sharp, tangy tongue-stripper types as you probably know by now. He's more a sweet soul. We spotted what looked like the perfect cocktails for ourselves (mine was from the 'gentleman's favourites' section of the menu, what does that tell you) and while I was quite chuffed with my rum concoction, I have to say the promise of chocolate in his wasn't quite what he expected.  \"I told you,\" I kept repeating. \"Prosecco. PROSECCO. There was no way it was going to resemble a milkshake.\"  Nope, it was an eclectic mix incorporating muddled grapes, fizz and a stick of criminally dark chocolate. Not for the... I won't say faint of heart, the sweet of tooth perchance? Still, this is our fault more than Voodoo's, but the drinks menu is a little complex and requires a good half-hour study. I personally love doing that, but it might not be to the taste of all punters.  All-round awesomeness anyway. That Voodoo's cast a spell on me!",

The band I was looking for was a ten piece Scottish horn band and the were due on Saturday; we were there Friday :-)    Can't win them all.  The place had a tiny restaurant and narrow bar.  We sat at a table and were told it was reserved which was very odd for a table in a small packed bar.  Anyway, if they have a band you like, the room was pretty large and people were having a good time. I guess this joint would get a 4 or 5 if we stayed.",

The bar could be tricky to find if you didn't have a sat nav or local knowledge of the area as it is tucked away in the corner of a street.   Upon arrival there was a bouncer on the door and leather walls led up to the main bar area - kinky!   There are several rooms to this place but alas the room I really wanted to go in with a square coloured dance floor, was being hired out for a private party for the evening.   The main bar was awesome - ornately decorated in black and gold and felt very plush - what a find! There are a number of booth like areas but we propped ourselves at the bar whilst looking over the cocktail menu.   The bar staff were awesome! After having a few drinks my partner decided he would like a Bourbon milk punch! And despite this not being on the menu off they went to make it! They needed a little guidance in making it but were willing to accommodate the request. The punch was delicious!   There was a DJ in the corner who played some awesome tunes which got people up and dancing including us.   Would definitely strut my stuff into this bar again.",

They offer an extensive (and expensive!) range of cocktails, prepared by extremely skilled bar staff. Seriously, these guys and gals don't just throw some vodka and pineapple juice in a mixer. One lass was blow torching rosemary at the bar for a \"smoked\" effect.   Despite it being a busy Friday night we were served pretty quickly, as staff effortlessly prepared complex feats of mixology. Unfortunately, my budget would only allow for 2 drinks, as cocktails start at 7.50, going up to 17 quid!   The name says dark and mysterious, the decor says luxury, the music says \"Turn the speakers off!\" as a mix of...I think the kids call it house, or something to that effect, blasts through the small bar and seating areas.   But, as a once in a while thing it's a nice treat, and the atmosphere is a mix of casual, to dolled up.",

The pie was pretty to look at and fairly tasty, a nice crust and a rich beef flavor, although a bit bland and one note. The burger was okay, good flavor but the bread choice for the bun was a bit odd, it was served on a long roll which took away from meat. The Brie alone would bring me back here.

Firstly, as mentioned numerous times below the decor is awesome, it's a bit like a young Catherine Zeta Jones, sexy and welcoming!  Big booths and a nice long bar!  There is an absolutely beautiful cherry blossom tree outside and if you catch it at the right times of the year, it's a great view from up above.  They have separate rooms that form a restaurant and a private area for functions etc, if you are smart, and sneaky like me, you can normally gate crash one of the private events going on. One time I snuck into hear a young guy form Glasgow, a white man with an afro, rock out some of the best MJ and Bill Withers covers I have ever heard (FYI 'Use me' by Bill Withers is my favourite song ever). This experience was made even more enjoyable by the absolutely orgasmic Mojito I was drinking at the time.  The cocktails are among the best in town, after a while  I normally go rogue and start asking for random things not on the menu - they have a huge espresso machine that looks like something form a steam punk film so that always make me think of espresso martinis  Another time I visited, during a mega snow storm, and the cherry blossom tree looked like a big mutant ice lolly, I spotted Phil Jupitus on the decks. It was the night before Black Friday, and I was relieved to be away from work and to have some time for a drink. The night before Black Friday is an apprehensive one as you want to forget about the absolute pumping you will get the next day, but also you can't forget about it as you need to start lubricating. Anyway, Big Phil is on the decks, so I said to the girl I'm with,   'WTF is PJ doing on the decks?'   to which she replied 'who is PJ?'   and I said 'Phil Jupitus, no?',   'no?!'  ....'oh...'  I'll just be star struck alone- I tried to play it cool and not go over to get my photo taken with him, but a few more cocktails and we started chatting.   'Hey Phil, I think you are awesome!'   'Thanks man'  'So why are you on the decks here?'  'I owed a guy a favour'  '....... Can I get a photo with you?'  'yeah, sure'  I still have the photo",

    "text": "Yep, I'm going 5 stars, despite my actually having reservations.  So whenever someone says, hey wanna see this band at the voodoo rooms, I always say yes. It's a top venue. I can only think of one duff band i've seen there in 8 years of going. Granted I'm not even there quarterly, but quality over quantity.  The bar is pretty small, and is always rammed when I'm there. Despite this the staff are crazy good, always serving multiple people, double pouring, all sorts of nonsense to make sure service is as fast as it can be.  I haven't had much of the food hear, the menu outside looks pretty tasty though. I did have a desert here a while back as means of securing a table. I can't remember the specifics of said desert, but both my date and I thought it was very tasty, and went well with our cocktails which were also super tasty.  All in all, I think the Voodoo Rooms are just really bloody cool. A hint of the forbidden speakeasy to it somehow. I'm totally charmed by the place, that and the amazing gigs, it has to be 5 stars.",

    "text": "We had dinner in the Voodoo Rooms. Many people still don't know that besides this being an awesome club and bar you can also have a decent meal in one of the restaurant rooms.   First you need to know that this place is a maze. There are steps and entrances all around. Secondly there is a constant buzz of people going from room to room, like an unintended swingers party, they're trying out the atmosphere in the different rooms. And so you should!   When seated in the room I couldn't help to think that this was just a few red glow light dimmer switch notches away from a dining in the dark experience. As luck would give it my wife is a gorgeous blonde and I was able to pick her out sitting opposite me. Who I noticed was trying to figure out the drinks and meal menu by the light of a candle.  - 1 star  You do get used to the dim reddish lighting and you'll find that the place is decorated with golden pillars, black wood panels, black leather chesterfield seats and cherry blossom trees in the window.  The word here is 'opulent' in a saturated form. It fits.   We had mains only, but the menu promised very nice starters and desserts.  My 28 day dry cured rib eye steak was cooked to requirement and I was very pleased with the skinny fries. this was accompanied by .... a big plastic bottle of Hellmans Mayonnaise.   Ehh.. really?  Yup. Hellmans. In. A. Bottle.  Plastic.   It took away the vibe and feel of a dark misty, opulent and classical setting and replaced it with a feel of a cheap corner caf with a power outage.  That shaved off a star in my book.   I do like to return here for their bar and especially their cocktails. I think they are impressive.  So in all a solid 3 stars, for now",

    "text": "Being in Edinburgh for a few days this week, I was bowled over by the choice of great drinking and dining options available.   We were at The Voodoo Rooms for an event downstairs and throughout this, the bar staff were efficient, effective, friendly and welcoming to our group. We had some cocktails in their 'Speakeasy' area, while also enjoying some food from the wide ranging and well priced dinner menu. All 3 of us went for the burgers which were obviously freshly made - plus they had a succulent flavour and texture that you don't get in normal run of the mill bars. I also liked the fact that although the Speakeasy bar was small, they still kept a good range of beers like Brooklyn in it as opposed to offering just a limited supply.  One of the bonuses of the Voodoo rooms is the fact that it's a labyrinth of rooms with loads of varying entertainment going on in different areas.  Their main bar upstairs is a real classic, quality long seating bar with a great vibe - the sort of place I'd love to spend more time just chilling out and relaxing in the afternoon with a nice pint and the newspaper.   I also really enjoyed their 'Ballroom' which had an excellent band playing 60's and 70's psychedelic music - this to me was the icing on the cake of an evening spent across all the bars in this venue.   I love places that are big enough to have loads of flow and give you the option to move around like you're at a house party, with loads of leisure and socialising options available - Voodoo rooms has this in abundance so check it out!",

    "text": "The first year or so I was in Edinburgh The Voodoo Rooms was a regular haunt of mine. It has fallen out of favour somewhat after a disastrous burlesque show I attended from which I may never recover (I will also never look at milk the same way again, ask no questions!)  The cocktails are pretty good. They take their time over them and so often your wait at the bar can stretch on, particularly on a Friday or Saturday night. The drinks are fairly worth the wait though. The food is alright. Nothing particularly memorable though and  it's never on my list for munch or dinner.  The staff are nice and generally quite amicable. I imagine it's hard to be as careful making cocktails correctly while the waiting punters multiply but they manage it!  The decor is probably what draws me the most. Black velvet curtains, gold awning and mirrored tables. The place screams gothic decadence, well, not loudly but it's definitely speaking in an outdoor voice indoors.  I'll update this review with less vague details should I return. Until then, it's a worth a gander and a decent place but it's not topping any lists for me.",
