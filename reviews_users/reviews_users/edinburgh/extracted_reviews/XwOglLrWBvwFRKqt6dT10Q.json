    "text": "My friend and I decided to spontaneously go out and celebrate one Friday night, so we got dressed up to the nines and selected Michael Neave as our destination - what a mistake!   When we walked in and asked for a table, we were greeted by a VERY condescending staffer who sneered at us and said: \"we can't seat ANYONE without a reservation\" even though it was early, and the place was less than half full...   While I can understand that there might be a number of reservations booked that night, the rude and insulting attitude of that host (when faced with two well-dressed, attractive people simply wanting to be seated for a meal) is nothing short of baffling to me.  Are civility and courtesy things that can be found at this establishment only by those with reservations?   I will never return to Michael Neave, and suggest that it be avoided at all costs.",

Our appetizers were excellent and the Blqck Pudding was the best I've tasted, but then I have a Canadian palate that isn't used to The idiosyncratic delights of Scottish cuisine.  Service was a bit slow but very friendly. After 30/40 minutes the manager approached our table and told me something was wrong with the lamb I had ordered. He told me that Chef was preparing a new plate and it would be two minutes. I was a bit surprised they didn't bring a small bite or offer us a drink but not a big deal.  When it arrived 10+minutes later it was delicious. Unfortunately, my friend's Cod was a lump of rock. The waiter confessed that Chef had let it sit near the oven to keep warm while he prepared my lamb. So back goes the Cod. When it arrives properly moist it was wonderful. The accompanying sides were average. They did take the Cod off the bill.  I suspect that this is a decent restaurant that had a bad day as the other reviews are good.",

Although it is out of sight from the Main Street, it has always been really full and twice I have been here without reservation, I was turned down so do make a reservation if you do decide to come.   I ordered the Scallops and black pudding as starter and they were delicately cooked to perfection.  The aroma of the black pudding goes well with the scallops and there light and not greasy at all.    The highlight here I have to say is the rump of Lamb which I ordered as my main.  They are cooked pink on a bed of mash, bacon and broadbeans.  So tender and juicy that I fell in love with them instantly.  They are the best rump of lamb I have eaten in Edinburgh so far.  I would happily come back here for the lamb again.   The panna cotta has just the right texture and right amount of sweetness to finish off my lovely 3 course meal.  Michael is an extremely talented chef and at his age, he is excellent at what he does.  I believe Michael's Steak and Seafood Bar is also one of his venture which mainly serves seafood.  I have a review on it as well so do read it as they are equally as good.",

They sold the place well and accurately!   Their sat lunch set menu was 11.95 for 2 courses or 14. 95 for 3. What a bargain! Only another 3 bucks for a yummy dessert! However.... In True 'Laura and Elaine' style we ended up choosing from the al a carte, the steak just too tempting an option for me to pass up.   My olive and mull cheddar tart was divine as were the tiny, warm homemade sun dried tomato bread rolls (I asked for more... Well I WAS hungover!!) which were served with your own individual serving of butter. Yum. Elaine's pigeon breast with smoky bacon also went down a storm. I had a taste and the thick lardons of bacon were delish and really made a difference.   My steak was tasty, I asked for medium well and although it was slightly done a little more well, i really didn't mind. It was seasoned beautifully but simply, the right mix of saltiness and spice. The fondant potato that came with it could have gone wrong (as they so often do) but it was perfect! Soft fluffy potato. It soaked up the nice bottle of French white wine we had nicely.   Dessert. Well. This was a slight let down but before I continue, they redeemed themselves more than I could have expected so I'm not marking them down. I chose sticky toffee pudding which I'd spied immediately upon first seeing the menu and it didn't matter what else I was eating I WAS HAVING THAT PUDDING!! So....It did look lovely but it had a funny taste which I couldn't place... Kind of doughy, like it wasn't cooked properly. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FGutted.com&s=e5e08fb570e8fa57819a7494adf2c773fb4dd5a84253dc3544a18b379720901c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gutted.com</a>! For once the waiter was nowhere to be seen so it sat uneaten for about 15 mins before he came back into the restaurant. I explained I didn't like the taste - was this a problem for them? No! He immediately apologised and I was offered something else. I chose the pistachio and elderflower parfait which was lovely, tart and creamy.   Another 2 glasses of wine and some coffee and we were ready to leave. Upon presenting the bill the waiter said BOTH desserts and BOTH glasses of wine were on the house with the apologies from the chef!! This goes to show, it's not about the mistake, it's how it's rectified!   The shame was the place was empty. On a sat afternoon! I know they are trying to build up custom slowly but they do deserve to be busy... So go forth my yelpers and scoff some of the highest quality food and experience some of the best service in Edinburgh!   I just really hope they don't let their current standards slip like so many restaurants do...",

    "text": "Three vistis in 6 days says it all really. Why the fifth star?   Monday to Friday sees Michael Neave lay on an Express Lunch Menu for those on the go. The idea is simple: set menu of 3 starters and 3 mains to choose from, with a set dessert of Chocolate and Cranberry Brownie with coffee and a scoop of the Ice Cream of the Day.  'Very good', I hear you cry, 'but why the fifth star?'  The dishes are fairly straightforward in order for those in a rush to come, eat and go in an efficient fashion. Although they may be straightforward, that doesn't mean in any way that the courses aren't of an extremely high standard. This is fine dining after all.  So I've been lucky enough to sample this Express Lunch Menu twice this week:  Wednesday Starter - Ham Hough with Melba Toast and Fig Chutney Main - Roasted Venison Rump with Crushed Potatoes and Onion Dessert - Brownie with Whisky Ice Cream  Friday Starter - Game Terrine with fruit chutney Main - Baked Salmon with a Smoked Fish Chowder Dessert - Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream  Two amazingly delectable meals.  'Indeed, Joe, very good But why the fifth star...?'  As if the above isn't already enough, the fifth star is awarded because of this:  8 for said 3 course menu, inclusive of coffee....!  Food of this quality is virtually impossible to find at this price. In fact I defy anyone to find somewhere that rivals this.  Every time I go here for the Express Lunch I feel like I'm robbing Michael Neave, to the point where I'll order a cocktail or a drink just to ramp the bill up a little.  It's ridiculous in the most amazing way ever. Said it before (see Los Cardos, see Oink, see Mosque Kitchen) and I'll say it again; the simple ideas are always the best.",

So below find my first review and here I will make only one additional comment:  The gnocci here would make my Italian grandmother pee herself with happiness. They are what gnocci should be. The Butternut Squash Gnocci was BY and FAR the best vegetarian meal I have had in Edinburgh... This is not to lessen the impressiveness  the standards there is a FINE selection of meals that I love dearly here. But not ONE came EVEN CLOSE. Michael... if you are looking for a wife. I maybe could be single.   -------------------  Joe occasionally forces me to see the finer things in life, and I like to think that I contribute a little to his love for the large array of Brass Monkey-like establishments in the city.   Today was Joe's day to introduce me to some fine eating (dining?).   Apparently Mr. Neave is some sort of freakish savant who is ten and a half years old running this very cool, very chic eatery on/off the Royal Mile. Blink and you'll miss it or ignore it for its annoyingly prime location with way too many tourist traps around. But this place is a GEM.   You walk in and the two adorable waiters/hosts, impeccably dressed I might add, are there to meet and greet. The bar is cool, definitely a place I would enjoy an overly expensive cocktail whilst a date and I wait for our table (if he's paying... if not, I'll have the beer). Then we go downstairs and on the table there are some of my favorite flowers on the table... (which I have only recently realized I don't know the name of).  The food. The one star loss is simply for the completely irrational idea that we needed BOTTLED STILL WATER. For real? We're in Scotland! That shit comes off frozen peaks of the Pentlands - I don't want bottled water, the tap is fine.    Now the good stuff. And I am a picky jerk when it comes to fancy restaurants because well, I don't really eat meat... and when you don't really eat meat at a nice restaurant (I'm talking to you MARK GREENAWAY AND STOCKBRIDGE (see my other reviews)) you get treated like a SECOND CLASS CITIZEN in this city.   Oh but not here. Michael the freakish savant loves vegetarians. He even loves us pescatarians more. And there were A GAZILLION THINGS on the menu I could eat! I was in fancy shit heaven.   I opted for the tomato and green pepper gnocci which, let me tell you, my Italian grandma, dead or not, would agree that this dude knows how to cook him some potato pasta. I'm going to make a statement where the word LITERALLY (as Joe would be proud of) is used correctly. This gnocci was LITERALLY the most well made gnocci I have ever in my whole life tasted and I have been to Italy, my family is Italian-American and I have had a very handsome Italian man make me a bowl and then do romantic and slightly filthy things to me and STILL... STILL... Michael, your gnocci wins. Hands down.   Then there was the cranberry brownie and that was OBVIOUSLY awesome cause it's a brownie and there's cranberries in it.   But the winner was the bread. As always, True to my American Ethnicity... the free bread made my life better.   Thank you Joe for showing me the way, both literally and figuratively.",

Kick back, enjoy the pleasant atmosphere, and relax conveniently just off the Royal Mile. I can't imagine a better lunch experience for the amount of money they charge.",
