    "text": "The best restaurant during my January 2017 Edinburgh trip. The courses from the appetizer to dessert was phenomenal. 45 pounds for this amazing 5 course meal is well worth it. Great ambiance and awesome service from the staff as well. One recommendation would be to not get the drink pairing but just order a bottle of wine from their selection offered instead. The drinks were not bad but probably not worth the 35 pounds in my mind.",

This was undoubtedly the best meal I have eaten in my entire life. I am not kidding. And my entire day revolves around food, all my holidays around dining out, etc. It's safe to say I have eaten at hundreds and hundreds of restaurants around the world. This was and still is the best yet. The menu ingredients were fantastic the month I went, fresh and rich. Each course was a work of art in terms of both flavour and presentation. I wish I had pictures to attach, but I was so wowed with the food I had no time to consider it! Each dish I had was innovative, unlike anything I'd ever encountered before. Everything is very clean, and the service was great. They answered any and all of our questions and took our coats and bags when we walked in. My only regret is not getting the paired drinks - I can only imagine the sort of artful drinks the people at Aizle would have produced! I can't wait until I go back again (once I can get the money to afford it) to have another fantastic and innovative meal!",

    "text": "Ever have one of those meals where you already start planning the next visit before dessert hits the table? Well, Aizle had me hankering for a future visit by the end of the bread course... it's THAT good.  I'll be brief in regards to the concept because many folks have already laid that out more eloquently than I could, but in a nutshell: Aizle works with a monthly \"harvest\" of locally sourced ingredients to build a set menu that switches each month. Though you know the ingredients, you aren't informed of each course, making the meal a total surprise. Though they happily cater to dietary restrictions, this type of meal is best suited for the culinary adventurer... picky eaters be warned.   Simply: what they do, they do well.  It's no secret that Aizle has some serious culinary ninjas in the kitchen, but what really struck me about the evening was that this little restaurant has a knack for story telling. So many meals nowadays are built on speed - quick meals where you can be in and out of the place within an hour. True, that concept comes in handy a lot of the time but as we delve more and more into speed dining, we lose the art of a \"good meal\" along the way. Those good ol' fashioned meals where you actually sit down to have a conversation and be present - chat about the day, about the food, take your time and put down your phone (between the food pics of course). The nature of Aizle's menu makes for an instant talking point and the pace of the food has a nice balance to keep you comfortably perking along without feeling rushed or bored. There are few places that encourage the art of a proper sit down meal and very few that master it... but Aizle makes it look effortless.  Great food, great drinks, great concept... but more importantly, Aizle makes for a good story... and after the food is gone, that's the best you can arrive at.",

    "text": "My wife and I were invited to Aizle (remember, rhymes with Hazel) for their 'pre-open' night, and found ourselves to be the very first customers to walk through the door.  Aizle has a new concept to dining, where the food is as fresh as it gets! There is no traditional set menu as their website explains, instead the husband & wife (Stuart the chef and Krystal the mixologist) duo have the freedom to use the freshest ingredients from farms and suppliers. You are given a list of all the ingredients and where they come from, which is a great touch. The restaurant is slightly rustic and modern, with cool chilled out music and very friendly staff. For a restaurant that isn't huge it does have a bar that you can sit at and try some of Krystal's own cocktails, there is a good size wine list, and finally a restaurant that hasn't stopped there but has added some decent beers for the beer drinkers. I had the Kindl Berliner Weisse, which is a fresh sour wheat beer and perfect with the fresh seafood that was coming out. All the food that we ate came from a tasting menu, and was some of the freshest and tastiest we have had. The oysters were the best I have tried. The veal tongue was a new one and was gorgeous, the hake was so fresh and soft it still tasted like the ocean. One of the highlights for me was the pig's cheek, so tender and just melted in the mouth.  Can't wait to go back and take friends, and glad we will always be remembered as the first people to eat here. Can seriously recommend it!",

The dessert, a block of custard with matcha and buckthorn sorbet, was a work of art with a good balance of sweet and tart flavors. Service was friendly without being overbearing.

    "text": "Prior to my trip to Edinburgh, I decided to research what restaurants were the best in the city that served Scottish food. It was one of my good friend's birthday and I wanted to take her out to a nice dinner. A few popped up, one of them being Aizle.   Aizle is defined as a spark or a glowing hot ember in the Scottish language. The restaurant encompasses local, seasonal ingredients where everything is made in house. As ingredients change, so does the menu consisting of a set 6 courses at 55 pounds per person.  Upon entering Aizle, you are enlightened by the warm decor the restaurant brings to its atmosphere. A menu of ingredients used for the meal is displayed on one of the walls at the entrance. The waiters and staff were oh so welcoming among the candlelit tables. As we were seated, we were greeted with some snacks to start and advised that the menu would be presented at the end of the meal. So without any knowledge of what would be presented before us other than the ingredients used to create the menu, we were set on a journey of Scottish cuisine:  SNACK: CHEDDAR CORNETTO. MOUNREYAC PEAR  SNACK: DUCK LEG. KIMCHI.   SNACK: MUSHROOM CHAWANMUSHI, JERUSALEM ARTICHOKE, PARMESAN.   MY FAVORITE: COURSE ONE: SHEEP'S MILK AGNOLOTTI, WILD LEEK, WHEY.   BREAD: CONFIT CHICKEN, BRIOCHE BUN, TRUFFLE.   COURSE TWO: COD, CELERIAC, GRAPES.   COURSE THREE: PEKING DUCK, HERITAGE CARROT, SANCHO, BUCKWHEAT. Sorry, I ended up eating this before I took the picture. IT was delicious though and the duck was cooked perfectly!   COURSE FOUR: GRANNY SMITH APPLE, WHITE CHOCOLATE.   COURSE FIVE: YORKSHIRE RHUBARB, HIBISCUS, SCOTTISH OATS.   Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Aizle. Some dishes took some time to be delivered to our table in between courses, but they were all beautifully executed. My favorite was the pasta dish: pillowy soft pasta filled with deliciously creamy cheese with a light broth to accompany the dish. It was wonderful in its own right. The staff were on point with catering to our needs and after a 2.5-3 hour meal, my friend and I left happy with a full tummy.",

As most have said, no menu, just a seemingly random list of ingredients which makes for a surprising and delicious evening.   We arrived at our reservation time and after verifying our dietary requirements/allergies the culinary show began. Each of the dishes were creative, full of flavour and beautifully presented. The waitress did an excellent job of introducing each dish and then leaving us to it.  I loved everything we had but the huge standouts were the monkfish, lamb, truffled cheese plate and the cherry dessert. I literally could not stop smiling.  Given the quality of ingredients and the number of dishes, Aizle is an amazing value at 45. They also have a good selection of cocktails and a nice wine list with several reasonably priced bottles. If I'm ever back in Edinburgh I will definitely return.",

    "text": "I wanted so desperately to love Aizle, which was to be our special, fancy dinner during our time in Edinburgh, but a love affair was perhaps not meant to be.  The space is incredibly small, very dark, and very, very warm. We felt like we were intruding on the conversation next to us during the times we were quiet during our meal. It was so hot in the restaurant that we opted not to have dessert due to discomfort. Our server was aloof in a way that deterred us from asking questions. The presentation of each course was beautiful, but the flavors were just okay. We left and stopped for food on the way back to the hotel due to hunger. The concept is fantastic - a list of ingredients with no menu and the only limit is the chef's imagination - but the execution just feels like it's trying too hard. We were given a piece of miso fudge (ehhh?) when we left, and I just found it cleaning out a drawer of our pantry, months after our vacation was over. It's fun to try new things, but the newness must be accompanied by delicious and enticing. This is where I felt it was lacking.  However, I'd give them 3 stars (I actually wish I could give them 3.5, but yelp hasn't gotten on the half-credit train) for the delicious cocktail menu, satisfying bread and butter starter, and their seemingly genuine concern with food allergies, as someone allergic to truffle oil, this is imperative. Especially when I'm an ocean away from home. The imaginative concept of course is also a positive, I just wish I had enjoyed it more. The menu changes constantly though, so discover for yourself just how adventurous your palette can be.",

I had made reservations weeks ago and was so glad I did, and they also mentioned they knew we were vegetarians which I was delighted about, having entered that in my info.

The \"snacks\" to start were amazing, my favorite being the leek soup with charcoal you have to crack at the top, and really all the dishes were great and well thought out. We had a terrific egg and corn succotash, their own sourdough with salted butter and then two desserts- I could barely finish everything! A feast for both the stomach and the eyes, I don't want to even write more about the food as half the fun is going to dine and not know exactly what you'll get. Highly recommend if you're in town!",

    "text": "This is probably my favourite overall restaurant in Edinburgh. They showcase so much of the best of Scottish/local meats and produce (hogget is often featured, but based on my visits and the multiple photos of it here they're finding all kinds of ways to prepare and present it) and the attention to detail is astonishing. It's not \"cheap and cheerful\" (well, it is pretty cheerful especially if you enjoy some of their exquisite cocktails with your dinner) but dinner at Aizle is comparable to ones I've had that cost several times more than here.   Each dish is so beautifully plated and presented you almost feel bad tearing into it with your utensils. But then you actually taste how incredible it is and you don't feel bad about it anymore.   Service is impeccable but not at all stuffy. It's so rare and lovely to be able to enjoy a meal of this calibre in such a relaxed and cosy ambiance.   If you're visiting and staying in the centre it's a short bus or cab ride over and worth a visit if you're a local as well.",

You don't get a menu as it is all decided on the day, you just get a preview of all the ingredients you are going to eat during your five courses meal. From the moment they bring their homemade bread, homemade butter and yeast (they even have a name for cultivating it) you know you are in for a treat. The food is delicious, dare I say Michelin quality. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and not over the top. The restaurant allows you to feel cosy and relax so you are in for a good night. We didn't go for drink matching as we were both driving that night, but I can recommend the non alcoholic homemade juices, my tastebuds were having the time of their life.",

    "text": "Aizle is definitely a five-star place for me in Edinburgh. I had dinner here a few weeks ago with fellow Yelper Mariana per her suggestion and I was not disappointed. First things first, the view out of the window of Salisbury Crags is amazing! The ambiance is lovely and cozy, a great place for a date or a gathering with friends. It is upscale casual, but not TOO upscale or uncomfortable at all. My favorite kind of place.   I am kind of obsessed with the concept of a blackboard board with ingredients and the chef creating the five course menu from there. I came hungry and truly enjoyed each and every course. I ate everything as listed, but they do enquire about dietary restrictions and seem fairly accommodating.The presentation of each dish was also beautiful. The care that goes in to the food here is astounding. We got cocktails and wine with our meal, but you can add a drink pairing for 30 (the 5 course meal is 45 and worth every penny). Next time I go I think I will do the whole thing up properly with the drinks pairing, but the cocktails we tried were absolutely lovely. Service was also impeccable. I have nothing to complain about with Aizle and I truly cannot wait to be back. I can't imagine a restaurant in Edinburgh that can beat this one.",

    "text": "I'd been wanting to go to Aizle for months and months!  I'd heard so many good things about it and couldn't wait to try the restaurant out for myself.  after some prodding my boyfriend made a booking and we went along at the start of March.  the restaurant is based on the south side of edinburgh on a road not particulary well known for it's culinary delights.  however, the inside is warm and welcoming like the staff with a dining area spilt over two rooms.  initially it was quite quiet when we arrived but the tables filled up relatively quickly so that when we left the restaurant was full.     i loved the idea that there was just a list of ingredients and your courses would each be made up from different items from the list.  it was fun to try and guess which items would be put together and what course they may come in.  what's a bit sad is that while people have raved about this restaurant about a month and a half after going i can actually hardly remember what we ate.  i remember a fish course that came with just about the best mashed potatoes i have ever eaten- buttery and creamy and super smooth, a beef course that while tasty had way too much meat on the plate for one course out of five in the evening, and the dessert being very orangey with a bit too much ricotta.    don't get me wrong though it was a very nice meal and the waiting staff were spot on with service and attention.  the cocktails we had were well made and enjoyable and it was a pleasant evening.  i'm not sure if the problem here was that i got too involved with the hype so my expectations were too high or it was just a bit of a low night with their new monthly ingredient menu just coming in.  either way, i think if the monthly menu appealed to me i would go again and hopefully be able to remember the food better the next time round.",

The meal consists of five creative courses inspired by seasonal, local produce.   Aizle is getting 5 stars from me because every single course delivered. Each dish brought interesting flavors to my tongue - there were no duds, no fillers. Just tastiness. The second course involved perhaps the yummiest carrots I have ever eaten.    I opted for the drinks pairing, which included a beer, three wines, and a cocktail (all small servings). The beverages complemented the food well. The cocktail (a strawberry concoction, the type of thing I would usually avoid) was particularly delicious. I'm looking forward to trying some more of their house cocktails on our next visit, which will be very soon.",

The food was amazing and the wine pairings were great and a bit different from what you'd expect. There was not a bad dish, everything was fresh and beautifully cooked.

They are fantastic at catering to any dietary requirements and you can just tell they put so much care into every plate.  The cocktails are always really tasty and compliment the food. The service is so super friendly and they're great at answering any questions.  Don't let the fact that there's no menu put you off. It's liberating not having to fuss and ponder and choose!
