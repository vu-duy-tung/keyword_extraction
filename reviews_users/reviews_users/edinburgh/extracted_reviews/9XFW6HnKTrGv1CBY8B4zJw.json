I loved the bruschetta, Caprese, olives, bread, fried calamari,  and the pizza (ordered by the others) looked amazing! The staff were very nice and knowledgeable. They have Aperol! The red wine as seen in the photo - very smooth and good. I don't like red wine but I did enjoy a glass of this one. Very convenient location in Grassmarket.",

    "text": "I had dinner here alone at an outside table Sunday night. It was a little cool out and windy so the sign out front said baked lasagna. I was sold. I had coffee, water, and baked lasagna for 16. Coffee included. When you consider no tipping this was a fantastic price. The lasagna was as I dreamed. Very hot and it came out on its own bakeware. It was bubbling still. This just made my salivating glands work in overdrive. I was not disappointed. The tastes were fabulous and while not in the description, there was ground beef in here too. Lots of cheese and good things.  I scraped the sides for all the baked goodness. The coffee was black and I ordered a second one. Black-- the way American men drink it. No milk, no sugar. It wasn't very strong, and there wasn't much... more like a small tea cup full but this is what I came to expect in Edinburgh and other Scottish towns. Ok, the downside... smokers at a table next to me. They were Italian or Eastern European tourists. I wish the restaurant had a no smoking policy or had a sign up saying something about smoking. Smoking ruins a meal.",

    "text": "If you've got a hankering for a big ol' bowl of pasta but don't feel like making it yourself AND don't feel like waiting (for the water to boil or in the ridiculous queues at other spots in town), then o'Oliviero might be for you.  Otherwise, skip it. This was the only blip during my holiday in Scotland, so I'm going to get these thoughts out of the way and then pretend it never happened.   We stopped because there wasn't a wait - maybe that should have been a sign. We quickly realized that very recently this place had changed hands (i.e. the wine menus were from the former restaurant), and they were still figuring things out. Our server was rude and dismissive, but that was because he was trying to manage serving all the tables in the front end of the restaurant while acting as the host to the steady stream of people coming in (bank holiday weekend, so it was buuuusssssssy). I get it. But still.   The food and drink? - My glass of valpolicello was FILLED with sediment - I've actually never experienced this at a restaurant before; it was a huge turnoff.  - I asked for a side of olives (something not on their menu alone currently), and out came a huge portion of pre-pitted generic green and black olives. They were flavorless and very soggy.  - I got the linguini with tomato sauce... Plentiful, yes. Flavorful, no. The sauce was soupy and the pasta was a bit limp.  - Tried a bite of the garlic bread (a big disc of it; it looked like it could be a pizza crust) and it was a bit too cardboardy for my likes.   But...to their credit, I'm full. And I no longer crave Italian.  However, I am also wondering why I didn't just run over to Sainsbury's and make some spaghetti myself.",

The chicken comes with some lettuce on the side, cherry tomatoes mixed in, and a side of chips (thick cut French fries). The dish seemed a bit random to me, and likely not worth 13.5 pounds, but it was serviceable in a pinch.",

    "text": "High Yield: Italian Restaurant in Grassroots area that is mildly overpriced, with decent service, solid pasta choices, ok pizza options, and cozy romantic environment.   Details:  Food; we ordered  Spinach pasta with asparagus and salmon- solid choice, noodles were al din and there was adequate asparagus to qualify it being called an asparagus pasta dish. nicely flavored and not too heavy in sauce. Good choice  Pasta d'Olivero: Stuffed Ravioli with smoke salmon and spinach- light sauce Oliviero Pizza- had artichokes, ham, and cheese - Good pizza, adequately flavored. I recommend asking for parmesan and pepper to give this pizza a stronger punch of flavor. It was a soothing taste otherwise.   Price: for 10-13 pounds, I thought this place was pricier than other fares we could have chosen in this Old Town Area. There are many places like Indian food, Thai food, and even Scottish food that were lower priced and tasted as good if not better. so I felt this place was pricy for its fare.   Service: Good service, friendly and warm enough waiters.   Overall: I feel a 3/5 is warranted because for its price it was rather pricy and the flavors were kinda forgettable. I only thought the oliviero pasta with the smoke salmon filling was worth getting. it was different from everything else. Pizza was a little forgettable. The Classic Spaghetti looked like all noodle nothing else.",

We sat in the back room which had a warm vibe but was pretty noisy. Our waiter was lovely! He answered all our questions patiently. The food was excellent. It tasted authentic and flavorful. Service was a little on the slow side but the food was absolutely worth it. This place is wonderful!",

I ordered lasagna and knew it wasn't right when I saw it. First bite wasn't good, but wasn't bad. Second bite almost made me vomit because it was still cold. It had to be a day old and warmed up in a microwave. My wife got margherita pizza and it was basically just cheese and sauce.   I have never, ever refused to pay for an item I ordered before today. I rarely ever even send food back. With so many other options in the area, I would really recommend skipping this one.   But the hostess truly was great!!!!",
