    "text": "I just moved to Edinburgh for my studies last fall and this is seriously my favorite spot to hang out in the city! The staff members are INCREDIBLY friendly (how often do you find that in a larger city?) and the food is amazing. (Especially the falafel!) You can get a tasty breakfast at any time (a huge plus) and they have a wonderful assortment of snack items (everything from yummy American-style fries to croissants with your choice of jam). They even have vegan items! It's the only cafe I go to on a weekly basis. And why not? The price is perfect and the food is wonderful. It's a win-win. :)   Plus, the free internet makes it the perfect place to study. :) (And it's close to the main U of Edinburgh library! Which is a huge help for me since I spend most of my time in the stacks looking for books.)   I highly recommend the Double Dutch! Be sure to stop by for dinner, too - the cafe has a special glow to it after the sun sets. :)",

    "text": "My husband and I stopped in here for a coffee enroute to another appointment.  The exterior looked nice and inviting but it was a bit different inside.  When we stepped through the door the place was totally empty apart from two members of staff having food and working on a lap top, they looked a bit surprised to see us but stopped eating and showed us to a table.  There was no music on which left the place silent and a bit unwelcoming.  They did put music on after taking our coffee order which helped certainly, as it did with a couple of other folk arriving.   The late and mocha both looked the part in nice tall glasses but didn't taste the best.  It was super sweet with no real chocolate flavour, I wonder if it was cheap hot chocolate powder? I never finished my mocha, which is unheard of!  Looking around, you get the impression that this little bistro has once been loved but it feels like the relationship is over, there were light bulbs out in every light fitting and a general tired feeling for the place.",

    "text": "The Olive Tree was a pleasant caffeine stop before my band's late night gig recently in Edinburgh. We were attracted by the exterior which was welcoming and cosey! Upon arriving, it seemed the staff were surprised to see us! And it was empty besides a couple having food. We didn't let this put us off and indulged in some lattes!  Despite being almost empty, a few of the tables were yet to be cleaned and that the staff still stood idly by. The cakes looked lovely but the cabinet wasn't the cleanest either which made us reluctant to come back and try them.   The toilet consisted of one large room which was dirty and lacking in toilet roll. Otherwise, my chai latte was lovely!",

Good large helpings as well as enough toast for a very reasonable 5.20.   Pleasant waitress and not a long wait between ordering and getting served so all in all a pleasant experience.",

    "text": "Located in a great spot in Nicolson Square, close to the University and the bustling Newington area of Edinburgh, this great little cafe is cheerful and serves great Mediterranean food. The menu is extensive, even at lunchtime, covering the usual lunchtime fare of paninis, soups, baked potatoes, etc., as well as more Mediterranean dishes such as couscous and falafel. Each time I have been there the food has been delicious and the service has been friendly and efficient. On my most recent visit I discovered the Mediterranean menu and ordered chicken couscous, which did exactly what it said on the tin and was delicious and healthy.  A great place for lunch or just for a quick coffee in the afternoon or before a show at the nearby Festival Theatre.",

It is in a nice sunny spot and is nice to sit outside for a meal and a drink enjoy a good conversation or just people watch. All food is made on site, including the cakes. they also have internet access downstairs. Linger a while in the light airy interior with an indulgent coffee and a cake or linger even longer outside in the sunshine with an ice cold beer.",

    "text": "Double Dutch is a lovely, busy little cafe/restaurant up by Edinburgh uni. It's a great place to stop in for a coffee, and an excellent place to have lunch. The food is creative and delicious (the open sandwiches are massive! and taste amazing!) There are different soups and specials every day, and the service is efficient and friendly. Double Dutch also has a quiet internet cafe downstairs from the restaurant. It is a chilled out little basement with about 15 computers, and the staff dont mind if you take coffees down to the computer which is nice!",

The eggy bread (or American style pancakes) with bacon and maple syrup are gorgeous and if you ask nicely they'll sometimes do you strawberries instead of bacon. Good range of yummy cakes.",

    "text": "This restaurant was okay the first time I ate there, but I returned yesterday and was extremely disappointed. Two of my friends ordered the full breakfast and not only were their eggs undercooked (the whites were still raw and runny), but there was MOLD on their toast! They told the waitress and she brought them new bread. I ordered the haggis roll and got two gray pieces of haggis on a cold hamburger bun that you could buy in the store. When we went to pay the bill I saw they had charged me an extra 60p for my sandwich, so we asked the waitress why and she said I had ordered an extra topping. I told her I had only had the haggis and she replied that the haggis IS the extra topping! A plain hamburger bun with NOTHING on it is 1.95, and anything you put on it is an additional 60p. Either the menu is very misleading or she had no idea what was going on because I have never heard of that before. She was incredibly rude about it and said, \"Well you're wrong, but whatever\" and took the 60p off the bill. Terrible place, my friends and I will never return.",

Well primarily, the tasty food. Secondly, the very reasonable prices. Moreover, the combination of friendly staff, quick service and a prime location make this my new regular hot spot. I recommend the Mediterranean section of the menu and also the full breakfast for THOSE Sunday mornings! The best mezze in Edinburgh!   I should also mention there is free wifi for customers and internet use on PCs.",
