    "text": "Where do you start with the Three Sisters? We went there to watch a EURO 2012 match in the hope that we could watch outside on the big screen in the nice weather  it was cold and wet  so we went inside and found a table in there. There is a fair sized bar with plenty of staff who were always busy serving and clearing tables but the bar does always seem to be really busy. Our round of drinks which consisted of 3 pints of lager, 1 pint of Guinness and 1 vodka mixer came in at about 20, which seems a bit overpriced to me, especially as later on they started serving them in plastic glasses which is never a good thing. The toilets are terrible. I don't know what the ladies are like, but the gents toilet is tiny and nowhere near fit for purpose. The bar was mainly full of men, so there are always queues to get in which is really annoying. The worst part of our visit was of course, the clientele. The pub seems to consist pretty much only for visiting English stag and hen parties so as you can imagine, it's not much fun for those of us who want a good, but quiet night out. However, I think the courtyard is a great idea with a big screen and bbq on the go and I'm sure it will be great to watch a game there if we ever get a summer, but I don't think I'll be going back to give it a try.   A generous 2 stars from me.",

    "text": "I spent 2 nights here at the three sisters. On the outside, you get the atmosphere of that similar to a beer garden on the East coast. Everybody is loud with excitement and plenty of beer to go around. As you continue walking, it takes you downstairs toward the DJ and a few bars, which gives a more dancing feel for the place. The first night (Friday) we were there, the DJ was playing request, which I thought was pretty cool. He played a few bangers in his mix, but he also played some outdated Destiny's Child. Although, you can't take away from the drunkies who love that music, you also have to play more of the new for those who actually enjoy getting their 2-step on. The 2nd night I was there was a bit of the same from the 1st night. The music just wasn't doing it for me as the DJ was now playing some end of the night closers that you usually hear as places close down. You really can't complain if you're walking into the place for free, the drinks are a bit pricey but for a bar with a great atmosphere you need to check it out. There are plenty of other bars/clubs in the area that play more of the dancing type music if you're looking for that",

The bouncers, for starters, are power-hungry idiots who use their only bit of influence in the world turning back potential paying customers. If you're in a group that happens to consist of a slightly higher male-to-female ratio, you won't be let in. If you do get in, there is no room to move, and the queue at the bar is about 6 people deep. No happy mediums here. Everyone who visits Edinburgh has heard of this place and wants to go there, so I would like to put an end to the reputation as a must-see place. There are so many other places to go that are far less aggravating.",

A fine summers evening had drawn us to the huge outdoor seating area of the Three Sisters, and as my friends bought the drinks and a Three Sisters BBQ blazed in the corner, I had an excellent time. The atmosphere was great and generally I had a very large amount of fun.   However, then the second half happened - it was getting busier and attracted a hen party and a seperate stag party, which generally ruined the chilled, relaxed and fun vibe that we had before. The night was also growing colder so we moved indoors - well, I say moved, i mean we jammed ourselves inside bearly able to move in a hot mass of drunken people. I attempted to buy a drink next, and after waiting for nearly 10 mins, a round for 3 people came to almost 25 - extorsionate.  So there you have it - get there early and you will have a great time, get there after everybody else does, and you might not want to come here again.",

    "text": "Ok, when I was politely asked by my friend if we could nip in here when she came through to visit I was powerless to say no. Not because I was massively eager to go here, but because I hate saying no to my friends!  We turned up here around 4ish on a Wednesday afternoon to find it was shut until five. Alright, that's acceptable, it is January. So we went on to Oz Bar had a drink there and returned around 5ish when it opened. Needless to say, we were the only people there! BUT I like this bar, it reminds me very much of Waxy O'Connors in Glasgow, except much more reasonably priced drinks. It is kinda dark and dingy inside, kinda like a generic Irish bar, but I quite like that, gives it something resembling an atmosphere. And this place is huge! Plenty of room for moving around if it is a little crowded.  So, the staff were fine. The chap serving us was very nice, got us drinks but it did take a little while before all the cutlery and menus etc were put out on the table. Think this might be because they were setting up for a private function, but we were in no rush. The menu - if you don't like pizza or burgers you are kinda a little shafted. It was definitely not the sort of food I was expecting, it was better. I ended up plumping for the Godfella, a burger with pepperoni, sundried balsamic tomatoes and little balls of mozzarella. Yet again, I was not setting the bar too high, I mean, Holyrood 9a anyone!? This burger was immense. I mean really delicious. Plus they had a deal on for January, get any main meal and get the second for 1p. Hells yes I will.  So basically, we had two burgers, and 4 drinks. Less than twenty squidders. Boom. I want another one of those burgers NOW.",

Usually during the week its pretty empty with only a few guys watching the football or having something to eat.  The actual bar is quite nice with big tables and a large outside seating area with patio heaters and umbrellas. Crucial in this climate! Usually in the summer it is jam packed as they have screens outside with football/rugby on and a BBQ going.   By the time it gets to about 9 o'clock on the weekend this bar can be horrendous. Horrendous in a full of pub crawls/stag and hen dos sort of way. This seems to be the hot spot for these groups so as you can imagine it can get very rowdy with the odd fight or two and someone throwing up in the corner. I personally do not enjoy bars like this, too much pink cowboy hats and 'lads on tour' going on for me.   I have been to The Three Sisters and had a good time, more often than not you will make a friend from Australia while sharing a table outside so it can be fun. But lately I bypass it because from the outside it looks like its brimming with lager louts and incredibly drunk students.",

There is absolutely no reason, I felt, to come in here - a non descript generic bar with no defining qualities to make me feel at home here. Too big, too many chavs.   Well, now I have to take all of that back, because I spent a long time getting quite quite hammered and watching fringe shows here last Monday. It was open late, served me alcohol long past when I deserved to still be drinking, and had an open courtyard where I could sit in the pouring rain talking to cute boys. I think in terms of pubs, I still prefer small and cozy over big and grandiose, but I see the Three Sisters in a new, warmer, more welcoming light than my prior judiciousness.",

It was supposed to be part of a student pub crawl and when we arrived at the three sisters they seemed really lost about what it was on about or the drink deals we had been promised. To add to this, the bartenders were extremely rude to us, got our drinks wrong and we had to pay more than we thought we should. To sum up we didn't stay long. Apparently we weren't the only ones treated this way either.   Apparently it's a place to watch footie or rugby matches at. It's over-commercialised which I think has damaged it quite a bit. Despite the ideal layout and building I strongly advise visitors of the City to try their luck elsewhere, as there are plenty of places with a much more welcoming atmosphere.",

Not so much the packed with people element, because I don't want to sound too middle aged, and a lot of my favourite drinking establishments are always rammed, I think it's just the lairy sports plus pints plus swilling them everywhere plus a general lads, lads, lads atmosphere that makes me feel like I need to go and sniff some perfume or look at something pink, just to feel a bit girly again.  The good features of The Three Sisters are as follows...it has the advantage of a large courtyard, so if there's decent weather, you've got the facilities to sit outside and banter away, which feels a bit more holiday-esque than usual. There are also sometimes BBQs here, which is a bonus. It's completely unpretentious, down to earth banter, and if you're into sport, you're in for some good times.",

Three Sisters definitely didn't disappoint - it was packed with people, and there were quite a few other bachelor/bachelorette parties there as well. The place had a very friendly (although pretty drunken) vibe and had a dance floor inside as well as an outside area for the smokers. Even though the place was packed, there were enough bartenders so the time waiting for a drink was kept at a minimum.  I would definitely recommend this place for any visitor looking for a fun, drunken night. The bathrooms are absolutely disgusting though.",

But it never quite lives up to this, and is overall a pretty average place. The interior is really dark, to the point that it's a hassle to walk anywhere, you have to kind of feel your way towards things. Also for the size, there a remarkably few seats, meaning you spend the vast majority of your time standing about, which is always a bit of a pain. The worst part of it though are the people that go in there. It's always full of chavs and on a weekend you feel like any minute a mass brawl is going to break out. It can be quite intimidating, and there's always a bit of anger just simmering under the surface.  It does have its good points though. The bar sells a good range of beers, wines and ciders as well as all the major spirits. The garden is probably the best feature, it is absolutely massive for a pub. During the summer it's a really good place to have a few drinks outside, or sometimes there's a big screen showing sports. At the moment (during the festival) they have a Crabbies garden in there as well, which is always a good thing in my book.",

I has an upstairs room in which live music and comedy shows are held, a small dance-floor downstairs and a courtyard which acts as a smoking area as well as a beer garden in summer.  Further, large screens are used for showing big sporting events which usually attract large crowds.   Depending on what one wants out of a Saturday night out The Three Sisters may or may not be the ideal venue to begin or spend it in.  It is often used as the site of Stag and Hen parties and, therefore, if your looking for a quiet drink and catchup with your friends this probably isn't the place.  On the other hand, if your feeling young and wild this is an ideal place to start the night as its lively, drinks are reasonably priced and service is sufficient for coping with the numbers who flock to its bars on Friday and Saturday nights.  I've been to The Three Sisters several times and always enjoyed myself, however, the atmosphere isn't quite as bustling or friendly as I'd like it to be.",

That being said the venue is great, big picnic style seating outside, large dance floors inside. Due to the crowd this usually becomes a one drink stop for friends and I, but have had the occasional good time.   St. Patrick's day was one of those good nights. Go expecting a crowd on weekends or game-nights. Definitely a hit-or-miss kind of deal.",

It was a great place to go as if you did not like the music in one room you could go to another.  It was a fun dance club and hot spot.

They play a variety of music, most importantly music I can dance to.  The drinks are a bit pricey and there isn't a lot of seating inside, but I do like the large outdoor area.  When you need a bit of breathing room, you can just head outside.  Yes, it is a magnet for hen/stag parties, but never been there when things have kicked off, although I think hen/stag parties are always entertaining to watch... from a distance... and that's why the large outside area comes in handy.  Never had to wait very long for drinks as the staff seem to be on top of it.",

They had setup a huge screen to watch and it was incredibly festive. Lots of drinks being thrown when England defeated Columbia in PK.   Rowdy crowd when cheering on England with a tamer crowd for the second game.   Highly recommended by a local and it was definitely a highlight for me in Edinburgh.",

She checked in the kitchen and said it was still cooking. Really? I took that to mean \"someone forgot it\". Waited another 10-15 minutes for it to come out and now I have no time to eat it and have to have it packed for takeaway. This took another ten minutes! They also tried to give me the pie without a proper lid which would have been horrible because I then had to literally run to get to a meeting 25 minutes away. They gave me another paper dish to put over it. Poor service. No apologies. No attempt to make up for the inconvenience. Also, no chip chop sauce that I paid extra for. The food was good cold so it must be great warm.",

There is literally something on every hour of the day.

We took a delegation of 6 Fins to enjoy a drink and show some studenty way of Edinburgh life.  Bearing in mind these 6 Fins were all in their 50 and 60's they did seem to enjoy it.   We were well attended to and promptly served. Shame about the loud music as this stifled the conversations (with already not so talkative Fins)  The table was big so it was not possible to hear the other's. Then the live band started playing outside and were duly blasted out of the speakers indoors. This was our cue to leave. It was just a bit too loud.  Prices are reasonable and it may be a good idea for them to 'employ' a cat as we did saw a mouse scuttle over the main floor.   Great place if you are a student, not so great if you take OAPs",

Although it's big, and has a huge open air area with an outside bar and food stalls, and the bar inside is quite big and pretty well stocked, getting served in under 5 minutes is usually impossible.  I don't know why! It just takes an age to work your way to the front of the queue. The staff are by no means slow, it's just one of those things.  With the huge courtyard always full of people, there is a bit of a \"meatmarket\" feel to proceedings, and even as a usually single guy, I feel a bit uncomfortable here with the amount of guys who just stand and ogle anything in a skirt, making usually unrepeatable comments. Not much the place can do about that in a huge courtyard, though...  During the Fringe, there are free shows all through the day, so it's worth checking out what's on while you grab your drink (eventually) and then head off elsewhere, as you always invariably do.  Unless there's a big sporting event being shown on the HUGE screen, this is very much a meet-and-move kinda place for me.",

You can here the cheering when a goal is scored a hundred yards down the road! It gets so busy that bouncers are placed at the gate to regulate the number of punters trying to enter the courtyard!

The toilets are wholly inadequate for the size of the potential crowd in the place & 18+ for 5 Jagerbombs (albeit with a free coke thrown in) is ludicrous.

You guessed it, jammed.  It's an honest place, it doesn't pretend to be above itself and I can dig that. I generally bring visitors here if they want a boogie and most are happy to while away the night chatting with the various tourists, Hen and Stag parties and the usual mix of people from back home. Others just scream 'Oh My God you brought us to Coppers!' and leg it.  The music is good and they show all the rugby. They have a barbeque outside. During the festival there is some pretty decent free shows, if you ever have a chance to see Bogan Bingo DO IT! It's endorsed by real Australians!  There's also some awful shows, I won't lie!

I don't do shots, well, not unless it's at a Yelp event, and I don't drink that much. When I go and have a drink somewhere with a group, I want to be able to understand them. At 7pm on a Thursday, apparently the music needed to be of the ear-deafening variety. To the point where I had to shout sitting at a table, next to someone, in order for them to understand me. I thought that was quite unnecessary.  I find it difficult to pinpoint what was so off-putting about this place. The staff are indeed friendly, the place is clean, spacious, but I'm not a major drinker. And somehow this bar gives the vibe of \"must get smashed gaaaah\". Not something that's very appealing to me. Maybe I should try it for a burger, as Jenny did, with some friends when the music is less loud. Or maybe, just maybe, this isn't for me.
