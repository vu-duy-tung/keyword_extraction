    "text": "I must confess first, that i waited after a few visits to get a feel for the new Brew Dog pub before coming to a conclusion and writing a review.  The Brew Dog bar is everything Brew Dog, with it's industrial chic interior, smashed tiles, and mix mash gym flooring on the wall. It's a pub stripped bare, to get straight to the basics.......Beer.  That's what it is all about, good beer.  Any beer lover should not miss this place, 14 taps half of which are guests from America, and the Continent, and the bottled beers must be close to 100 by now.  And who cares if the beer is from a keg and not cask, because they all taste amazing.  It took 2 months to revisit Brew Dog after my first visits, and i found myself going back 2 days later. Why you ask? Because i finally got to do what i intend to use the Brew Dog pub for. Going in when they place is not rammed on a weekend, sample some beers you will not find anywhre else in Scotland, line the belly with one of their spicy pizzas, and just appriciate good beer.  4 Stars for the quality, the innovation, the friendly cool staff and the balls to pull this off in the Cowgate. If only there was just more room.",

I spend too much time here so am probably biased but in general whether in a big group or even on your own it's a great place to hang out.   Recommend first timers start on a punk IPA to get themselves used to the very hoppy taste. After that move onto something a little different - ask the bar staff for a taste of something that you like the sound of or just tell them what you usually like and they'll suggest something.  All in all a great atmosphere, fantastic staff, and an excellent drinking hole.",

    "text": "I was happy when I heard Brew Dog were to open a bar in Edinburgh and now I have a good few visits under my belt, I am convinced that the novelty isn't likely to wear off any time soon and that we have a truly great little bar in the heart of town.  There is something written on the wall as you come in that states something along the lines of \"No Football! No shots! No Stella!\" and that sums it up pretty well.  No football, and therefore no football nutters, you are there to enjoy the beer and that chat, if you dont want that - go elsewhere.  No shots, no stella - its not a place for drinking like a tit, its about quality alcohol.  With a wide range of bottles and drafts, there is likely something for everyone.  For people that think you don't like beer, theres a good chance these guys could find something that will change your mind.  These exceptionally well trained staff can help you find exactly what you are looking for and will offer tasters if you want to try one of the draft beers.  The cost of a normal pint is slightly below the average, but they do their speciality beers which go up in price massively (but so does the ABV!!)  All a bar, its great, comfy, modern but not \"shiny\" and prestigious.  Not huge, but a really great atmosphere and very welcoming.  Decent background music too.  Going back to the non-pretentious comment, that applies to the staff too.  Although they are beer experts, they are not beer snobs and if like me, you enjoy real beer but don't know anything about it, they seem to enjoy educating you, not judging you and there is no way you are likely to feel out of place.  The menu, while minimal, is great with really tasty freshly made pizzas, burgers and cheese boards at very reasonable prices.  Brewdog are genuinely impressive at creating a buzz and i'm sure their story will be a case-study in marketing one day, and while some may dismiss what they do as gimmicky, I applaud their approach to doing something different, breaking the mould and giving us this great little bar, with great beer and great pizza.",

    "text": "If you're not familiar with BrewDog, they're an independent Scottish Brewery who make a point of breaking with convention and this is reflected in their bars.  The decor is a cross between \"industrial Chic\" and \"retro High School\" with bare brick, concrete and steel combined with minimal furniture that looks like it had been recycled from a high school science lab and wood panelling resembling a school gymnasium floor. Some people like this change from the \"norm\", personally I find it a bit abrasive, although they do have a couple old leather sofas which are more comfortable.  The bar attracts a rather eclectic crowd including students, stag parties, beer geeks, tourists and office workers so it can get rather crowded especially at the weekends. What attracts all these people to the bar is mostly the beer, you won't find any of the normal commercial big name brands here you WILL find a good number (6 or 7) of Brew Dog beers on tap plus another (4 or 5) guest beers on tap from craft breweries around the world (e.g. Ngne , Mikkeller or Stones), all of which are listed on large blackboards above the bar.   If you don't know what to drink, ask the bar staff they are only too happy to help out with suggestions and small tasters so you find a beer that you'll enjoy (all Brew Dog bar staff spend some time working and training in the brewery before working in the bar so they should be helpful and knowledgeable about the beers on offer). These are not your regular beers, BrewDog has been heavily influenced by the American craft beer market which means their beers tend to be made with a lot of hops compared to most beers you'll come across in the UK. This means those who do not regularly drink beer may be pleasantly surprised and discover a beer they actually enjoy. It also means that quite a few of the beers are stronger than normal which is why the stronger beers are priced and served as 1/3 or 2/3 of a pint (this is listed on the blackboards beside the price and strength). There is also a massive collection of bottled beers from all around the world, although some of these are rather expensive due to their scarcity.  On the down side they do NOT have a large range of non-beer drinks, with a very limited range of wines and spirits available, it IS after all a brewery bar and it's all about the beer. To soak up all that beer they offer a small selection of pizzas (the topping are also unconventional, no Margaritas or Americanos!) as well as Meat & Cheese platters which are excellent accompaniments with your beer.  Even if you are not normally a beer drinker this bar is an experience worth trying, I suggest going on a mid-week afternoon when it is quiet and you can take your time to chat with the bar staff and taste a range of the beers available.",

They serve a wide variety of their own excellent fresh beer along with a selection of other breweries' offerings. The servers are friendly and can talk beer with the best of them i.e., my darling who is an amazing brewer in his own right. There's one comfy seating area with couches, a wooden pallet table and board games. Stools and low tables are available -- bare bones but nobody cares. I confess, I've never eaten there but they do offer tidbits to help soak up some of their delish beer. Highly recommended!",

    "text": "In addition to my five stars I give this place a Bronze Star for merit, a whole sheet of Gold stars I stole from my teacher's desk, and all the stars I can see from my window.  This place is simply glorious. So many amazing, amazing beers. When I left LA I didn't expect to see a Stone IPA again but here it is, and at only 3.50 or so a pint, amazingly priced.  People say this place is expensive, but I'd disagree. 3 or 4 for a pint of beer on the cowgate isn't that expensive, especially not when you're getting a Camden Town or something - the quality of beer you get here is far better than the pish spilling out of your rusty old Tennents or Belhaven tap.  Some tell me that \"here it's 2.50 or 3.50 for a half pint or a third of a pint\" but to that I'd retort that the third of a pint of 9, 10 or 12% draught you get at Brewdog works out at least as strong as the 4 whiskey and coke you'd get up the street. And again - the quality trumps anything else you'd get.  Also it's easy to overlook the food, but this is another area where Brewdog excel. I didn't have a cheese and meat platter but they looked damn good. I went for one of the \"Hot Bitch\" pizzas, or something obscenely titled like that, and it was definitely hot. Not nearly enough places actually deliver when they say \"hot\" but seemingly like everything at Brewdog, it's every bit as amazing as you hope.  It gets a little crowded and sometimes it's hard to find somewhere to sit. But if you like beer, then goddamn, this is a great little pub.",

Brew Dog is proof-positive that there is hope for high-quality craft beer in the UK and beyond.  Loved the Hardcore IPA (Medicine for HopHeads).  Also really enjoyed a guest-brew of Drop Dead Imperial Stout.  Tasted several others, including the Punk IPA and a Hef (Vice Bier)  that would be fabulous on a hot day.  (Does it ever get hot in Edinburgh?)  If you love interesting well-made beer and a friendly environment, this is a must-visit place.  My only complaint...the bar stools are too short.

There is a bit of a style/substance mismatch in with almost all of both in the beers and none of it in the establishment. Nice try with the old school gym floor used to cover the walls, but it doesn't quite work.  The last time I was here I ordered a pizza and I hope I'm not alone in this, but to call this food is a gross misrepresentation of the truth. It was dry, bland, flimsy and vastly over-priced at eight quid.  So, when it comes to food and interior design I think BrewDog are soft of the target, however I come here for the beer, oh the beer!  I've been a fan of Punk IPA and it's lovely hoppy goodness for years, and when I recently had a bash at Dead Pony Club... oh my, I felt like I was cheating on the Punk with its younger, hoppier sister. Love this beer!  Every time I go I usually try something different and I'm rarely disappointed. If you're into interesting (and gloriously hoppy) beer then this is the place for you.  Mmmm, beer!",

Discerning patrons now have a decent option for a pint between The Grassmarket and Bannerman's.   Decked out in a style possibly not too far removed from that of parts of the firm's brewery there are around 10 taps and a very large number of bottled beers (the strongest according to their list being the 17% Red Horizon from Nogne O (listed under Barley Wines/Other so split hairs if you wish) and the dearest being a tie between two offerings in the Porter/Stout section from the Mikkeller brewery. Their Beer Geek Brunch Weasel (12.7%) and Beer Geek Breakfast Bacon (7.5%) coming in at 15 each. Pints though are at what seems to be the Edinburgh norm for the moment so between 3.20 - 3.50).

After being introduced through a mutual acquaintance I think we can both be honest in saying... there was a spark.  You know how it goes, one thing leading to the next. But how long could we keep telling ourselves they were merely chance encounters? When we both knew at some point, sooner rather than later, we would \"bump into one another\", as they say.  It's been fun so far, not taking each other too seriously; me with my ascots and Game of Thrones obsessions, you with your \"unofficial\" cola (still love that!) and your Tokyos... okay so that last one IS a little serious, and I prmise not to mention Godzilla again!   I suppose what I'm trying to say is we have to start taking ourselves seriously if this relationship is going to develop. And with that I need to get something off my chest....  Please, please, PLEASE expand your drinks range!  I knew what you were coming into this and I will never begrudge you that, your warm and social atmosphere had me at \"hello\", but meet me halfway and lose the stubbornness. Yes, you specialize in beer; no, this does not mean that has to be exclusive.   Get yourself a set of optics and play some jazz with the mixers. If you've got room for some cheese and some cold meats, you've got room for a bottle of Jack or two. At the moment this relationship seems a little one-sided, and I haven't complained so far, even making do with your substitute bourbon and \"cola\", but enough's enough.  I want to spend more time with you, we had a good thing for a while there, but if you can't change your ways, I'm afraid you leave me no choice and I fear we are like to grow apart.  I'd like to say \"it's not you, it's me\".... but I can't. That would be a lie. But what I will say is this:  Get some ruddy spirits!  Til we meet again...  Sincerely,  JOE.",

I'd had a few at home in Texas and had read about some of their more creative offerings like Tactical Nuclear Penguin.  So, I naturally put this on my list of things to do.  I stopped in on a Friday night so it was of course busy.  I got the feeling this was a student hang out.  None of this bothered me though.  I was on a mission to try as many of their beers here as I could before stumbling back to my hotel.  The bartenders were friendly and helpful in their descriptions of the beers.  Despite the crowd, they had enough people working behind the bar to prevent a long wait.  The bar itself had a casual almost coffee shop feel to it with low overstuffed couches along one wall and coffee tables in addition to the taller tables and chairs.  The BrewDog attitude was very much in evidence with their humorous signs regarding the proper behavior while enjoying their beers.  The atmosphere is comfortable but I knew what I was headed for.  If you're wanting a nice sit down dinner, go to a restaurant.  Leave this for the after dinner treat.   Their beers...oh their beers.  So being a North American, I'm used to super hopped beer. In general in the UK, I found that even if the beer is labeled an IPA it's not going to come close in hoppiness to one of our Pale Ales let alone one of our crazed IPAs.  This wasn't really a bother for me but if you're missing your hops, you'll find them here with some of their offerings.  I won't make this too long with all the beers I sampled but let me tell you right now their Paradox Jura is on and oh my...  That may be the brew love of my life.  I never found anything on their site but did find other references to them aging this beer in scotch whisky barrels which is something BrewDog likes to do (good on them too!).  I went back 2 other times for this beer on my trip-yes it's THAT good.  If you're a beer fan you should consider stopping in.  If you're visiting from my continent and are a fan of Rogue, Stone or Dogfish Head breweries, you should run here immediately upon your arrival.  I'm confident you'll be thanking me.",

    "text": "I'm a bit of a brewery hopper, though most of my experience is in the United States. This isn't the actual brewery but is a VERY fun little bar that has all of Brewdog's beers. They brew a lot of American style IPAs, which are packed with hops, and American Pale Ales, which for me is great since that's what I'm used to and enjoy.  The location is a little confusing to get to if you're a tourist, and you may cross over the street a few times before realizing how to get down to the pub, but it's worth the wait! The atmosphere is great in the evening, and everyone is extremely friendly.   If they have it, you have to try Sink the Bismarck! The strongest beer on Earth at 41% alcohol. It's not as scary as you imagine, and after waiting for a good long time to get my hands on it, I was supremely satisfied.",

Food here is actually quite good, pizza offerings are better than par (and par = perhaps Pizza Express). Service was quite slow...almost deliberately. Nonetheless, it's a good stop just a \"block\" south of the Royal Mile on Cowgate. Tip: Cowgate doesn't intersect with many of the streets that bear off of the \"Mile\". Use a good mapping app or simply approach from Grassmarket.",

Sure, Brew Dog beer is very tasty and much nicer than the pish we're used to drinking in standard pubs.  That's a fact and I won't argue with it.  I LIKE real beer. But, the setting here ... I could take it or leave it.  When I walked in, it was busy but not manic by any definition.  I headed to the bar and, being not terribly familiar with the selection, hummed and hawed for a few minutes.  The bartender stood there and scowled at me, offering no help or suggestions.  I could have sworn that I read somewhere that the Brew Dog bartenders are educated in the beers they serve etcetcetc.  I would have thought that, to accompany that education, might be a bit of excitement about their product and the desire to impart that excitement on their customers.  Apparenly I was wrong.    I ordered my pints and headed on my way.  My friend and I sat ourselves at a tiny, awkward table and chatted as the place filled up with it's Friday after work crowd.  When it was my turn to be treated to a pint, I would normally have gone for something different but just couldn't bring myself to get excited about it so just got the same.    The quality of the beer does not make up for the combination of somewhat surly staff with not terribly comfortable surroundings (not to mention, located in the student-hole of the city).  So, A-OK from me, but it's not a place I'll be rushing back to.",

Haven't tried the latest pizza offerings but I'm sure they will still be good. Was in with a BrewDog virgin so asked the staff for a taste of a couple of beers no problem as you'd expect,  I went for the misspent youth a very nice little number while he went for the big hoppy jack hammer. We enjoyed our beers in the much improved outdoor seating area as there was no free booths inside; I feel getting rid of the old seat  completely may of lower the capacity of the place and if your not in early enough to get a seat you may leave after a couple; there's nowhere to rest your pint. The only other sad note was the bare looking fridges the guest bottles choice was rather bare and the row above the back bar was just teasing me with beers they no longer had in stock. All in all I will be back as often as the student budget allows.",

I highly recommend it for students and locals to try this place out, .but maybe not the ma and pa (too grungy?)   They have a wide range of beers for everyone. Some who enjoy the classic blondes, or the darker richer ales. The brand is unique. The overall experience of the bar is not just the atmosphere, its trying a new brew!   The interior has a cool vibe, and they have board games in the corner you can use! How amazing is that!?! (game of checkers anyone?)   I'd only say my only downpoint is that if you don't love brewdog beer there aren't as many other selections to choose from as an alternative as you'd find in most bars. Also, the toilets are really bad. I know were in the Cowgate, but if they put some time into them that would make the place that much better!!",

    "text": "After leaving our meeting pub on my friend's Stag night in Edinburgh, most people needed to check in, and since the other half and I came up the night before, we were tasked to find the next pub. The only thing we were told, \"Make sure it has a lot of ales\".  So we quested. We asked Yelp. We walked into places, but nothing seemed right. I finally found BrewDog on Yelp, and it sounded like it had potential. When the two of us walked in, we realized we had found the place for our before dinner drinks. We let them know where it was (with specific instructions that the street it was on was a full level below Bridge, so don't try to take Bridge, which they did causing them to take ages to find it, plus Google maps seems to have the location down the street, closer to the bridge), and we settled in to try some beer.   My first impression was that it was crowded but not too crowded that we couldn't fit 11 people around. Luckily, right before the rest of the group showed up, the people at the couch in the corner left, so we snuck in to steal the area before anyone else did. It's a bit more trendy and modern than most British pubs seem to be, which was nice for a group of mostly young guys. They all were really happy that we found the place.  The beers. Well they were tasty, but a bit overwhelming on the palate. Mostly due to the overabundance of hops in all the beers (from the BrewDog beers to the guest beers, they all seemed this way). Because of that, there's definitely an American feeling to the beers, much like how Rogue brewery in the US overhops their beers. The difference? American hops are a bit more harsh and perfume-y than British hops, so while it wasn't my style of choice, the beer was tasty. It didn't go down quickly, as all the beer there is quite high in alcohol content. The lowest was under 5%, but just barely--squeaking in at a 4.9%. They serve smaller sizes of beer as you go up in alcohol.  The 5% beers were standard in pints, go up to 7%, and it's a 2/3 pint. My first beers, the Yin and Yang guest ales broke in at a higher than usual 10%, and were served in 1/3 pint sizes. (Also, one was an amber, one was a stout. You drink half of each then mix together, which made for interesting beer drinking). Of course, if you get the Tactical Nuclear Penguin (coming in at a whopping 38%), it comes in about 10 mL servings. It's like beer liquor.   It was a great vibe, and quite a bit of fun. About six of us broke out the Jenga (as there is a good selection of board games, well so-so selection, as Monopoly should never be included in a good selection), and we played a few rounds which many of the barstaff and patrons were quite happy to watch. We didn't have any food, but the pizza choices looked very interesting, and I saw some meat and cheese platters come out and they looked amazing.  All in all, a good time was had, and I would not turn down a trip to another BrewDog (which the closest is in Camden, so a much easier trip). If you don't like American style beers or establishments, this place might not be for you.",

The bar is fairly new (opened in 2011) with quite an industrial feel to the decor, lots of hip people hang out here as well as beer geeks like me.  They usually have 8 beers on tap (or is it 10?), half of them Brewdog beers, half of them guest beers from other find craft breweries all over the world. As well as tap beers they have a good selection of bottled beers, Brewdog's own as well as top notch offerings from America, Sweden, Belgium and Japan.  Really love these Brewdog offerings:  5AM Saint Hardcore IPA, Dogma, Rip Tide, Tokyo.  For guest/bottle beers try anything by Baird Brewing (American/Japanese couple's small craft brewery in Japan), Stone Brewing (USA) and Hitachinoko (Japan) as well as Mikellor) and you'll be in for a treat.  Also recommend you try some barely wine (Mikellor I think is the brewer) and the food is also pretty tasty. Pizza and beer, nice.",

I like real ale and like the more traditional pub, BrewDog though is more akin to a funky wine bar, but they serve beer, really good beer.  Their own beers do tend to be hoppy, but are tasty  - Punk IPA and Trashy Blonde being standard tipples of mine, though I occasionally go for the Hardcore IPA (tasty but 9.2%) if I only intend to have a few drinks.  Being a brewers pub it is nice to see them supporting other micro-brewers, normally having 3 or 4 guest beers on tap generally all good beers.  BrewDog sells beer and focusses on that, some of those beers are really silly (double figures % values) but don't go expecting a \"normal\" pub (much better than that), these folk treat beer as a craft and the beer is the focus.  Real beer, done right - recommended!",

We were given samples of the things we were curious about, and the beers that we each selected were DELICIOUS--I had a porter, and my friend had a surprisingly good red, which we followed up by some kind of wicked 10% ABV that was decadently sweet and flavorful.  It was a wee bit crowded even for a Thursday night, so I imagine this place is slammed on weekends. Regardless, if you're looking for a good place to enjoy a beer after a long day, or are meeting up with friends, I could see this being an ideal place to go. Not only that, but they had some excellent songs playing in the background... think Modest Mouse and the like. Suited me just fine!

The Edinburgh bar in particular has added some great booths, a lot more comfy than their previous set-up. The day we were in it was particularly busy since there was a food festival on next door, but Brewdog had its own foodie event in the form of Louise Campbell, an Edinburgh baker who makes Brewdog inspired cupcakes. If you can track Louise Campbell down, get some of her cakes because they are amazing!   My only concern in Brewdog Edinburgh was the staff. They were doing their best with the busy crowds but I kinda felt their service was a little lacklustre. They seemed more concerned with chatting to their mates who were in than serving or advising punters. Not something that would put me off since I enjoy their beers so much but meh!

They have a nice selection of their own as well as several guest taps and collaborations. Bartenders are happy to let you taste before ordering a full pint so make sure to ask for a sample. Space is smaller inside, but pub has a good amount of outdoor seating. Taps rotate frequently which is great so you get a variety if you go more than once over the course of a few days. Never had anything bad here the three times we went over a week away in the city. Go for the beer, not the food. Menu is limited and the pizzas are middle of the road. Food is there to help prolong the drinking more than being its own culinary destination. Food works in a pinch, but this place is all about the beer.

Not a Belhaven or Guinness to be seen in this place and that's quite a good thing. From our perspective as visitors from the US, Brewdog definitely stand up to their counterparts stateside in inventive beers (think: Russian River, Rogue, Lost Abbey, and Stone breweries.)  However sometimes they go too far and we had a half a pint of a beer that tasted like carbonated soy sauce. I gave a sip to someone who had tried that beer before and he said it tasted rather off. The bartender would not agree and refused to replace it. Which is fine, I ordered it, but it's still an unfortunate thing.

So you'll often see Stone Brewery (USA), Ngene (Norway) and Mikkeller (Dutch) beers, among others, on tap. They also have a nice selection of bottled craft beer as well.  To go with their \"Beer for Punks\" theme, the decor and food also takes a departure from the typical pub scene. There are comfy leather couches in one corner and a decent amount of seating with small tables. They even have a stack of board games in the corner.

Definitely made for sipping as it reminds me of a whiskey. If you're into IPAs their Hardcore IPA is great. The staff was also very friendly.",

    "text": "For centuries the Scottish have been quietly producing some of the finest goods on the planet and only occasionally letting the rest of the world about it.   Then along came Brew dog, who decided to change all of the rules. They assaulted the world with men in penguin suits and a totally new way of thinking about brewing. In doing so, they took on a lot of people that had quietly been producing terrible beers.   James Watt and Martin Dickie have taken on the beer industry, the media and even Parliament in their attempt to move the population away from fizzy yellow beers to Craft Brewed Ales and Lagers.   This location is just another step in the Penguin Domination plan for Brew Dog.  Inside the decor is a utilitarian industrial interior which still offers a lot of comfortable seating. It is obvious that the beer is the focus of this space and the large bar dominates the one wall with large BrewDog beer pumps along it. A variety of non-Brew Dog craft beers are also on sale with Stone, Mikkeller, Struise, Alesmith and Three Floyds available.   One thing I do love about this place is the possibility of picking up a Growler of beer for home consumption. I used to enjoy this tradition in Eastern Europe, travelling to the local pivnice to pick up the beer for dinner. Brew Dog offers something similar in that you can take beer home in specially designed containers or 'Growlers'.   Food is available in the form of cheese and meat plates, along with pizzas, but they are really not the focus of this place.   If you want to step away from the conventional ale pub and step up to something special. Get your butt in here.",

At one point I think the majority of the bar was singing along to Girls Just Wanna Have Fun. Definitely a young crowd being located on Cowgate, but it's a relatively chill place.",

You can't drive 5 miles without passing near one.  Rated #1 in the States.  Basically the craft beer capital of the world.  Kind of a big deal.  Point being, I'm spoiled rotten when it comes to great beer.  It's local and accessible.  Moreover it's the norm.  I'm not use to drinking shitty watery \"what are hops?\" pub ales like most of you blokes.  But BrewDog!  Who do these guys think they are?!!!  Their beer is...INCREDIBLE!  INVENTIVE!  And BATSHIT INSANE in the best way possible!  They are mad!   And all in a land where beer of this caliber is non-existent!  INCONCEIVABLE!  It's criminal to remain a UK-only curiosity.  The truth is BrewDog would stand out in any town, not just in the UK.  Please expand!  Please do!  Make haste!  (Send me a CASE!)  -Hardcore IPA = ONE OF THE BEST IPAs EVER MADE BY MORTAL MEN.  Congrats.  -Tactical Nuclear Penguin and Sink the Bismark.  Among the worlds strongest beer ever produced.  This super concentrated beer (freeze distillation!)  has an ABV as high as 41%...HOLY CATS!    -Beer cocktails?  Yup!  The Hardcore Zombie was quite enjoyable.  Would drink again.  Here I was about to lose all hope of finding good beer in the UK until I stumbled into this bar.  Except you guys make great beer.  Thank you!   P.S.  Props on The San Diego Scotch Ale co-lab with Ballast Point!  Was a wee bit expensive else I would have tried it.  (I fail)",

Really though, I am addicted to their 5am Saint. They have some 'standard' beers done incredibly well - the Ingrid, a double IPA that even I liked, and I don't generally like IPAs, the Trashy Blonde, a tasty pale ale, et cetera - as well as some rather special concoctions. We tried the Tokyo, which they only serve in one-third pints because it clocks in at 18% - and tastes amazing. Unfortunately, after festival madness they were all out of, and we couldn't try, their landmark beers - Tactical Nuclear Penguin, at 32% and Sink the Bismarck, clocking in at a whopping 41%. Yeow.  The bar itself is nice enough, rather sparse with low tables and stools that sort of look like they were hammered together by tipsy bartenders from plywood, but it goes with their Beer for Punks slogan. The bartenders, every time I've been there, were super friendly and conversational, more than willing to dish out samples and information, and letting us savor our pints and come back for more... and more... and more...",

He introduced us to the world of crafting artisan beers. (And associated marketing) - which sells more  in Sweden than in the home country of Scotland! (strange but True fact  We were offered a selection of 6 ales, beers. from 4.8 to 18.1 ABV.  \"Tactical Nuclear Penguin\" is my favourite.   I must try \"Sinking the Bismarck\" - which was a result of a 'nuclear' beer arms race between Scotland and Germany.   ooh too many good falvours and tastes and stories..

It is an amazing Scottish business that started small and has done really well very quickly, both because of its quality brews and because of what it stands for. I love that BrewDog is all about being unique and being themselves by brewing all told crazy types of beer, and they are all about trying new things and revolutionizing the British (and world) pub culture by providing quality craft beer. They focus on providing us with crazy, cool, and ever-changing selections of beers on tap and in the bottle. This is definitely my style rather than flavor-less beer for the effect and not the experience.  The BrewDog Edinburgh pub is cosy and the staff are super friendly and helpful, providing los of tasters to help you sample and make decisions on what to try next. I also think that it is totally awesome that they actually have a whole stack of games to play! How fun!  For those who are not fully into beer, the downside is that the cider selection is small (and no ciders on tap) and there are just a few wines usually. They do have some innovative beer cocktails that I'd really like to try, too, along with their constantly-changing beer list.",

Brewdog is a small chain but one which beats to an ultra independent and 'them and us' attitude when it comes to taking on the generic and bland pubs of the high street.   If the truth be told, I've started to get a little bored of their core range of beers and prefer to go for something a little bit limited release (Brewdog are the masters of brewing tons of random brews each year - each with mixed results) or treat myself to one of their many guest bottles from either home or abroad (mainly USA craft)  Last night I enjoyed some Bear republic and I'd highly recommend trying anything from this brewery.   The vibe at this time of night was what you'd call relaxed but with an edge. The clientele was mid 20's to 50's - with everyone quaffing while listening to some quality LCD soundsystem pumping out of the speakers - this for me was the highlight as I love a good place that gets the music loud enough that you can really feel it, but then still is just right to chat with your pal.   The Edinburgh bar is one of my fave brewdogs in UK - the only thing that let's it down is the quite rancid toilets which are like something from a small and pokey local train - with a smell to match!   Go here for good beer and good vibes - it's as simple as that",

    "text": "I've been a fan of Brew Dog beers for a while without ever really paying attention to anything other then they were a Scottish microbrewery created by 2 Scottish beer geeks.  Their beers are just a little overpriced for ne but I do enjoy going every few months for a couple of schooners of their latest creations. The bar has a ''studenty'' feel as you enter with big comfy booths and a spattering of tables and chairs covering the majority of the entrance area.  The beers are cold which is always good for real beers & ales but at 4-4.50 per schooner, I go back to my point of the bar being a Iittle overpriced.  Service is dished up with an air of beery geeky Greek godliness which is just what I wanted, although being new to the BrewDog ways, I felt a little under pressure like I should have known what I was doing but that feeling went as quick as it came when the gent serving me allowed me to sample a few beers until I found one I liked.  l didn't try the food, I did try the beers and I did like the music having quite a relaxing time doing so, even more so knowing there was a full bar for friends who maybe don't like beer (the shame). All in all a nice bar that achieves to deliver copious amounts at beer to Edinburgh's craft beer hungry population.  Would definitely prefer to go with friends for a nice night out than on my own for a quick beer.",

I've been a fan of Brewdog for years and often tried to track down their brew in Canada, so when I moved here, this flagship pub made the rounds the first week. This place is epitome of what a distillery should be: unpretentious, experimental and with free wifi and access to pizza. So many distilleries I've visited throughout the years (and there have been a few, I moved here from a town boasting 45+ within the city limits) try and complicate things. They get so caught up in trying to LOOK amazing, that they end up confusing the consumer with what they're really about. When really, if they ARE amazing, there is no need for bells and whistles.  Serve good craft beer. Serve good food. Have good staff. = amazing.  Brewdog gets this. I'm a fan.",

Not too keen on the design, it's modern industrial which I find a bit cold and soulless but hey, it's interesting to have an alternative to the traditional pub style. (and I only go there during the day, I'm sure there's more life to it at night and on the weekend) The beers are ok, I'm not a huge brewdog fan as I find their beers very hoppy but I do like their porter.  Anyway, it's good to have craft breweries and Brewdog is good so on the whole it's a positive review. Though the location's a bit crap, it's in an under pass on the cowgate. Haha, this is meant to be a positive review!  The staff are friendly enough. Definitely worth a visit if you're into modern style, craft brewery pubs/bars.",

    "text": "A BrewDog is a BrewDog is a BrewDog. Yes and no. BrewDog Edinburgh is the second BrewDog location I've been to. The first being Shepherd's Bush. Yeah, they serve the same - or mostly same - selection of beers but the spaces are different.  Shepherd's Bush is busy and it's hard to find a table and people don't seem to ever leave. Edinburgh is a smaller space but it seemed that people rotated in and out. We were there twice on New Years Eve (before and after dinner) and we were able to snag a table on both occasions. And can I tell you how nice it was to be able to sit down and not be crowded and have people breathing down your neck? It was super nice. Also, the bathrooms are pretty good too. Not the best in Edinburgh but they do the trick when in need.  We had a variety of beers, one of which was the kriek and it was terrible. Kriek is a cherry beer and one of my favorites when are in Belgium but the kriek I drank at BrewDog was not like the kriek I drink in Belgium. I don't know if this was because they had just changed out the keg and I had the first glass from the keg or what but it was really quite terrible.  My husband ordered the \"ginger\" something-or-other which was actually a cocktail made with ginger beer and real beer and it was super good though not something you'd drink to get completely intoxicated because the alcohol content was quite low.  We also consumed our stand-by/regulars, the Punk and Dead Pony. Both were as they should be, Punk and Dead Pony.  So, why the five stars if I didn't like the kriek beer I ordered? It's because I like the rotating clientele which keeps things fresh (also a bit more upscale clientele, no totally hammered 18yos), the staff is friendly, the pizza smelled wonderful (kitchen closes at 10pm), and I like many of their other beers, so there.",

The staff was friendly and we all found a beer we liked.  Not far from Edinburgh Castle (which was where we were headed for our day excursion).

The space at this location was on the smaller side with a small patio and menu of around ten pizzas ranging from vegetarian to Hawaiian. I saddled up to the bar to order a flight and found that several of the options I hoped to order were no longer available. Unfortunately, the boards were not updated to reflect this so it became a somewhat comical experience trying to fill the flight with something I might actually enjoy.  In the end, the experience wasn't quite as special and smooth as the one I had at their Columbus, Ohio location.",

The wait staff at locations we've visited (and in the past) are always friendly, helpful with your choices and offer tasters with no attitude or bother.  BrewDog also has guest taps that tend to be a bit more exotic at times and therefore interesting to try.  We've had their food on occasion, typical pub food and nothing extraordinary but then again, we're not there for the food, we're there for the brews.  We only wish they'd consider Austin Texas as a choice one day.  The vibe of Austin would mesh well with BrewDog's beer styles and would fit well in Austin.  Think about it guys but go north to the Domain area for the best area!",

The Edinburgh location, while not my favorite, was a good experience as usual.  Looking into the menu ahead of time, I knew that this location really only served pizza. This, perhaps, is why it doesn't rank top on my list of locations, as I prefer their more burger-based menus. However, like all Brewdog locations, you know you can find at least a couple really solid vegan options.  So when we were there, we ordered the vegan option available at the time. This was mostly a mushroom pizza with some rolled up slices of zucchini on top. But really, what carried the pizza was the taste of both the dough and sauce. Each were made well, with a lot of flavor.  And of course, we also enjoyed a couple beers while we were there. The bartender on staff was extremely helpful in steering us towards beers we would like most. He gave us a couple samples, and was able to recommend some alternate beers for those that were currently not available at the time. The can I ended up with for my second beer was a strong and juicy IPA, just the way I like them.  So at the end of the day, if you like Brewdog, you won't be disappointed with their Edinburgh location.",

    "text": "This is the second BrewDog I've been to, Newcastle being the first.  This one is tucked away on cow gate and it wasn't obvious what it was a first, but then I said \"Hey, there is another BrewDog, we are so getting a pint!\"  Which we did.  Actually, this time I realized they did tasting so I had the 1/3 pint of 4 different things.  Right now the board is heavy on the IPA's, Which is fine, but more variety would be nice.  I had the hop fiction, the punker IPA, the black lagger and the riptide.  I have to say the black lagger and the riptide were excellent.  Riptide is a favorite for sure.  The other two IPA were very good representatives of those species, and enjoyed as well.    They had the mythical Westbrook Mexican chocolate on the board and as we debated getting it (at the time I didn't know of its Mythic status) they ran out!.  I had texted a picture to a friend and he begged me to order the westbrook as he had heard rumors of it.  But Like I said, a sad day, they ran out.  I think it is pretty cool as well they stock some good guess beers as well as their own.    this location is a bit small, but cozy booths are present and seems like a varied crowd which is nice.  Only a bit off the royal mile, but hidden enough to keep the hoards away.",

    "text": "We had just arrived in Edinburgh exhausted and very hungry. We went to the closest place we could find with good reviews, and this place was an excellent spot. They have a great beer selection and the pizza is excellent. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were friendly and efficient with their service.   You can taste any of the beers before you decide them (I don't know if there is a limit on that).   If you sit at a table, you go to the bar to order drinks and food, but remember the number of the table you sat at.",

    "text": "Friends wanted to check out this pub. The inside has a lot of seating and some tables outside as well. The inside is decorated with merchandise, artists paintings on the walls, and has metal decor. I thought the bartender could have been a bit nicer honestly. She didn't smile and didn't seem to be in a good mood honestly, and the bar was not very busy but she was very quick to leave my sight right after giving me my beer.   The beer was good. They had some special ones like ice cream beer (marshmallow and lemon lime) and a 22% beer, which we really wanted to try! If you're looking for a nice quick bar pub, this place is fine.",

    "text": "Brew Dog Edinburgh is a great bar with a chilled atmosphere hidden in the Cowgate. They specialise in craft beer both there own and other breweries.  The staff are knowledgeable and relaxed. They know exactly what they have in stock and what to suggest if you mention you want something like X.   There isn't a huge amount of seating but I love the booths if you can get one. There also is a small amount of outdoor seating which is great for people watching in the summer.  They have a pile of board games in the corner and it's a lovely place to while away a few hours with friends.   Brewdog serve food but not a huge selection of stuff. The pizzas are a good size for a meal for one or a snack for two.",

    "text": "Tucked away on Cowgate, this is the bar for craft beer drinkers in Edinburgh. BrewDog keeps several guest taps on draft to compliment their own micro brews.  There is also a wide array of bottle beers, and cider if that's your thing.  A limited menu is available which features pizzas and English pies.  My favorite is the Rocket Man pizza, though they can get heavy handed with the greens.  The bartenders tend to be very helpful; could be because they're part owners.  Pay attention to size next to the price.  Most beers are not served pint sized.  Craft enthusiast will appreciate this, along with the fact that beers are served in the proper glassware. You may consider this snooty if you enjoy crappy beer.  The crowd can also be on the hipster side but I can live with that for good beer.",
