It stands out from the crowd by offering a customers a good choice of breads, great fillings, soups, fresh coffee, hot pies and tasty pastries. It is quite a funky little place and the staff always look really cool, but they know how to knock up a mean sandwich. If you're stuck by the range of fillings on offer, the menu board lists some exciting suggestions - recently I tried Jarlsberg, Cumberland Sausage and Mango Chutney, toasted on an oval roll, needless to say if was delicious.  If you're looking for something a little different to a boring chicken mayonnaise sandwich on soggy sliced white bread, then look no further than The Globe. They'll even deliver to you!",
