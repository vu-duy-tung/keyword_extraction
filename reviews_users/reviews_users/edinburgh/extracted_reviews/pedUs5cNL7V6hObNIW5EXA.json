The friendliness and warmth of the staff make up for the tacky decor and extremely cramped space, and the food was just a touch above good.  My wife had the seafood risotto, and I went with a mushroom pizza. Italian food should be simple and fresh, and these dishes at least managed that in principle. It was a bit bland and slapdash for my liking, but given the price and location I really couldn't complain.  Looking for a gourmet dinner? Give it a miss. Want a tasty quick bite, delivered with a smile? Gordon's will do for you.",

Came by this restaurant on a wet Sunday evening looking for a warm meal and felt immediately welcome by all the wait staff and, apparently, Gordon. I had the pizza fungi and it was absolutely delicious!! Well seasoned, well cooked toppings, good cheese and a nice thin crust.   Oh, and free wifi - useful for people dining alone and wanting to browse the web while eating.",

    "text": "It's interesting to read the variety of opinions about this place.  I've been here once, and I don't remember having a particularly strong opinion on it either way.  Nonetheless, it is worthy of a review.  The restaurant itself is situated on the bustling Royal Mile, which at this time of year (summer) is full of tourists, though mercifully not as busy as when the Festival is on.  It enjoys a prime location on a street that is devoid of many restaurants, instead being full of gift shops for the tourists.  I personally didn't find the food to be too memorable, but then if I want an Italian meal, I will tend to default to Pizza Express.  I do, however, remember enjoying a nice sorbet for dessert, which was very tasty.  My other lasting memory is of someone cheering when a glass was dropped on the floor, but this is something that happens everywhere of course!  It's a small restaurant inside, and it does feel a little dated in the decor.  On the whole, the experience was a good one, but I tend to feel that I would go for a chain restaurant in preference.",

    "text": "visited on tuesday 29th march - using a groupon voucher - went early doors before heading to see Greg Davies at Royal Festival Hall (far superior to this experience) ... Arrived to a restaurant with just two other tables of people in it (to be fair it was only 5.30pm) but for some reason got stuck right next to another couple despite loads of empty seats - and the next couple half an hour later got put directly next to us...! The starters (minestrone soup) and pizza garlic bread with tomato were ok... nothing flash, but edible at least. The mains however (nothing tricky - a parma ham pizza and a mushroom, ham and pepperoni pizza) were awful - bland, tasteless, undercooked and stodgy - the \"ham\" was reformed nonsense and the pepperoni full of fat... obviously the guy serving (looked like maybe the owner) spotted the vast leftovers on the plates - and asked \"what was wrong\" to which I discreetly pointed out the pizzas were undercooked and tasteless - his reaction... a shrug and wandering off to fetch us the bill. Interesting take on customer service.   I'd thoroughly recommend going to any number of other far better eateries in Edinburgh - i'm reviewing at least two others after this that were outstanding - shame some continue to appal whilst those around shine brighter...   And to top it off, the place was filthy.   AVOID.",

Gordon's had a table, though, so ... off we went.  Gordon's is the kind of place that I learned about in my first city-living experience, in my teens in London (my family lived in the UK when I was in high school), where my very-foodie family made a point of learning all about the restaurant and cooking scene in the city. Neighborhood joints are always happy discoveries, which is knowledge I've carried with me on travels to cities across the globe, from Riyadh (weirdly good Thai scene) to NYC to Paris to San Francisco to Chicago to Nawlins.  Anyway, Gordon's welcomed us, served us some gloriously tasty dinner - I had salmon (photo), my buddy went for the carbo load with a fettucini Alfredo that looked sinfully good - and became another on my list of Great Neighborhood Joints in Cities of the World.",

I love that he is in trenches and not just watching. He walked around and mingled when he wasn't serving or clearing plates.  We are in Scotland for the Fringe Festival and this place is located right at the entrance. It was prime dinner hour and drinks were flowing, good food all around! I saw a neighboring table order the most delectable charcuterie. Dang, it made me drool.  The lasagna was excellent - it's all about the sauce and the meat. The noodles were an afterthought. Only wished it came with bread so we could have scooped it all up. Extra charge for garlic or bread basket so we just skipped (not thinking, I could've ordered it after our entrees arrived). The margherita pizza was excellent as well, simple and delicious. The sauce! Tangy but not overly salty, very robust and it was not oily as others have stated in their reviews. Only thing, they didn't pre-slice it. They gave us a steak knife to cut it ourselves. I guess that's how it's done here.  Must try: the chicken Milanese. The breaded cutlets (two large pieces!) were still moist on the inside and not burnt or charred on the outside. Soft and tender chicken. I only wished my salad part of the meal came with diced tomatoes as I've had before in other places. And there was no dressing on the salad but it was still good altogether. The roasted potatoes and onions were crispy and charred but oh so yummy. The more burnt, only added to the perfect texture and taste.  Skip on the beef stroganoff, very saucy but the beef strips were very thin cut. I found it dry but the sauce covered a lot of that. Very hearty dish since it came with salad and rice.   The place is on the Royal Mile so I was lucky to score the last table for four! The desserts all looked heavenly and gorgeously plated but we were too full to eat more.",

We weren't that hungry so asked if it would be a problem if we shared a margherita pizza and could we have a small bowl of chillis as my partner doesn't like them. The answer was 'no problem, leave it with me'. A small bowl of chillis arrived at the table in an incredibly hot sauce. The pizza arrived, surprisingly, halved an on separate plates.

My husband and I shared bruschetta, salad, lasagna, pizza, and couldn't resist taking a caramel cheesecake back to the hotel for later. Will definitely return here when back in Edinburgh. One of the best Italian food we've ever had in our many travels.",

Everyone was warm and friendly (welcome to Scotland) and location is great - right in the middle of the Royal Mile.   If you're craving Italian, this is your spot.   (Also tried Bella Italia in Old Town. It's good but not as good as Gordon's.)",

    "text": "With so many great dining options all around, it's a shame to have to spend an evening here.  I'll admit, I wasn't all that excited about it to begin with.  Perusing the menu didn't help.  I ordered bruschetta, thinking it was a safe choice and that maybe I'd try a friend's dish.  It wasn't so much bruschetta as french bread with tomatoes.  Normally, I like basil, garlic, olive oil, vinegar and FLAVOR on my bruschetta.  A friend had to hunt down our missing waitress, and then I asked for some mozzarella.  I had to do surgery to this thing or starve.  She brings out a plate with a couple of golf ball sized pieces of mozzarella.  Seriously?  Now I'm picking apart mozzarella balls with my hands in order to add it to my bruschetta.  I dab on some vinegar I've found on the table to give it more acid... and it's finally edible.  If I wanted to make my own bruschetta, I could have stayed home... and it would have been much better.",

The owner, his sweet wife, chefs and staff took the best care of us and the food and hospitality was absolutely amazing.  Rugby culture and all things Florence run True here.

Let Gary choose your meal. Simply tell him what you're in the mood for and he'll come back with a choice that will completely satisfy you!  A warm atmosphere and an ambiance that might make you forget you're in Edinburgh.   Great prices in a great part of the city. A fantastic choice for lunch and dinner as I've had both experiences there.",

    "text": "Visited this restaurant one night and it was pretty quiet.  For a restaurant with prime location on the Royal Mile, I would have expected it to be busier, especially on bank holiday weekend.  There were two other tables occupied and we were invited to sit anywhere we wanted.  It's a odd space arrangement, the kitchen is at the door which provides a narrow eating area along side it or else you venture to the back where there is more space.  The room temperature is a bit crazy here too, it was nice and cosy at the wall, but there was a cool draft down the centre of the space.  So we moved early on to find a cosier table before ordering.   I ordered the ham, spicy pepperoni, onion and mushroom pizza and the my friend, a pasta (forgot what exactly, but in the menu is stated \"go on give it a try\")!  The pizza arrived and was a good size, but sadly the base was cooked underneath, but the top was still soggy.  Flavour wise, it was good, much better that my companions over salty pasta dish.  I wasn't all that impressed and the interior is basic and dated.  The restaurant is dependant on tourist who don't know better.  Expected more from a restaurant on Royal Mile, there are better Italian restaurants out there... Go a bit further a field and got to La Favorita, in Leith.",
