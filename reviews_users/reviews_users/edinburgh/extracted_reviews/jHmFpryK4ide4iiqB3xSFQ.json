The matre'd was a bit confused about the name we were reserved under- a minor glitch- and soon the five of us were seated for our meal. It was really crowded and loud (I think some rugby match was on) but they managed to remain efficient and we hardly waited for our food.   So to cut to the chase the food was actually quite good- at least my Gai Yang dish was. I am not a huge fan of too hot foods and the menu is helpful by showing the dishes that will make you tear up or what not.   We were a bit rushed through the meal though, they were obviously hoping for a quick turnover. Next time I hope they realise people want to enjoy a meal if they are going to pay restaurant prices for it, rather than being rushed through it then out in the cold again.",

The food here is lovely, very authentic thai and isn't overly flavored with coconut like some of the other thai restaurants in Ed.   The decor is very nice and calming and the staff are just lovely. Very curtious and friendly. They are always happy to advise and will help you choose if you are not used to thai food.   I used to live round the corner from the old restaurant and we regularly went here for take away - they still do takeaway in the new place. Worth it if you fancy a night at home and lovely food. I don't think they deliver and it not cheapest take away but worth it.   Try it - you won't regret it!",

The restaurant has a warm and inviting atmosphere and the staff were all very polite and attentive. We opted for banquet B as it's a great way of trying a selection of dishes and finished every dish.

No MSG and the manager will suit your needs in adjusting dishes if you have special dietary restrictions. The waitress was very warm and affectionate too, wearing a traditional dress. The coconut ice cream was especially delicious having roasted coconut flakes mixed in and on top, giving a unique flavor in comparison to other coconut ice creams I have eaten. Food was perfectly cooked and flavored. And the bathroom was very clean which is not that common among Asian restaurants in the Americas. This restaurant is set within the old part of the city which is enjoyable to see too. I highly recommend it, just don't ask anyone who works there to take your photo because we did not get any good pics when doing so on my birthday. Cheers!",

My cousin, husband and I came here to eat dinner one night because it was close to the hostel, and we love Thai food.  We walked in and asked for a table for 3.  The maitre'd or server just said, \"No table for 3\"...and just stood there staring at us.  There were 2 unoccupied tables nearby so I said, \"There's a table right there.\"  And she repeated, \"No table for 3.\"  She obviously have not had any training in customer service because the least she could do was offer us seats at the bar, or tell us how long the wait will be.  Instead, she just stood there and stared at us like an idiot.  So I took the initiative and asked how long the wait is.  She said, \"I don't know, 50 minutes?\"  We walked out because I didn't feel like playing 20 Questions with an incompetent idiot.",

As soon i walked in the door i was made to feel most welcome, the restaurant inside is spotlessly clean and tastefully decorated.  The service was relaxed and freindly and our waitress explained some of the dishes I was curious about. When the starters arrvied, you could tell straight away they were made with love , fresh and very full of flavour.  I choose the Jungle Curry for my main, which the waitress explained was the hottest dish on the menu and was concerned that it would be too hot for me (which I thought was very considerate). When the main did arrive it was very spicy!! but not spicy for spicy sake, just hot and jammed packed full of flavour!! Without a doubt the best Thai Restaurant in Edinburgh!  I have eaten in all most all of them.  The place was very busy but we were never made to feel rushed or was the service compromised.  I cant say enough about this place! Please go and enjoy, But Book before you do!!",

I have been coming here for years and the food has always been consistently good.  The restaurant sits on Johnston Terrace just beneath Edinburgh Castle, so it's perfectly located for tourists who've been trawling the tartan tat shops on the Royal Mile. It is not a large restaurant, but they have put mirrors round the walls to create an illusion of space. The decor feels modern and Eastern, there is a large Buddha to greet you at the door, and the staff dress in traditional clothes which all adds to the authenticity of the place. The food is fresh and flavoursome and they never use MSG. I judge a good Thai on the quality of the Som Tum (papaya salad) and they know how to make a good one here - it's fresh, crunchy and with just enough of a chilli kick to pack a punch. My only complaint is that they don't do home delivery!",

Situated just around the corner from the Royal Mile, the Thai Orchid is right behind Edinburgh Castle and so it is an ideal place for tourists to stop off for a meal.   The inside of the restaurant is really modern, contemporary and spacious with plenty of tables and chairs and so it would be a great place to bring a large party. I came here for the first time several weeks ago and I had the most beautiful meal, and I can't wait to go back. Thai Orchid's menu offers a vast choice of authentic Thai dishes. I had the tempura prawns for a starter with a chili sauce which really amazing - it wasn't too heavy for a starter and the prawns were perfectly cooked. i then had the Thai prawn salad for my main course which was scrummy! The prawns were really tasty and was mixed with lots of Thai herbs and spices giving it lots of flavour. Each dish on the menu has a warning next to it showing how spicy it is which is very welcome as it means you won't get your head blown off with an unexpected chili and ruin your meal.   The prices at Thai Orchid are really reasonable, with most starters priced at about 5 and the majority of the main courses costing less than 10. This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.",

Normally served with a sweet and sour peanut dip, which they amended to a chilli dip for me. They were lovely and light and not at all greasy.  My friend Fraser had the PEEK GAI TODD, Spicy Thai style chicken wings which he enjoyed. For mains, I had KOW PAD KIEW WAN GAI, fried rice with chicken, vegetables and green curry. This was spicy without being too hot. Fraser went for MOO PAD KING, pork stir fried with ginger and mixed vegetables. Apart from the onions that he doesn't like unless well done, it was wolfed down.  For afters, we had a pot of Green Tea. We could have had coffee or Ice Cream.  The portion sizes were lovely for lunch.  I thoroughly enjoyed the meal, and look forward to going back one evening and try the full menu.  The bill for the 2 of us was 15.90 as we had no extra drinks. The restaurant is on twitter (@ThaiOrchid_) and on Facebook. After viewing their menu online, I used twitter to discuss alternatives as I have a mild peanut allergy. They responded very quickly, which resulted in me booking a table.  I am glad I did.",

    "text": "Based on Yelp reviews, my husband and I decided to check this place out. I was a little skeptical as the restaurant is located right across the street from Edinburgh Castle, so I was expecting mediocre food since it is located in such a touristy area.   We stopped in for lunch and were greeted and seated immediately. I ordered the spicy chicken fried rice off the business lunch menu and it was fantastic. I will warn you though that when they say spicy, they mean it. It is not like in England when they say spicy and you can barely taste any flavor. It is more like spicy in the US where you suddenly need to take a Zantac for heartburn. I was pleasantly surprised and quite pleased with my meal which came with a starter and a dessert (vanilla ice cream, imported from Italy - I actually asked if it was homemade as it was so delish).  My husband ordered spicy beef with a side of fried rice. We both thought that his meal was overpriced for the portion size but he said it was tasty. I'd recommend ordering off the business lunch menu if you are there for lunch as you will get quite the break in price and will get a starter, main, and dessert.  Dress code is casual for lunch (jeans and a sweater is just fine). Cannot comment on dinner service.",

    "text": "Thai Orchid is some of the most solid Thai food I have had in a long time, definitely the best I have had in the UK. I found it, as others have said, while wandering around Edinburgh Castle looking for somewhere to stop and eat. I was a bit wary of Thai in Scotland, but the menu looked good and I literally couldnt walk another step.   Upon entering the restaurant I noticed how clean and nicely decorated it was. The staff greeted us immediately and were very friendly. They remained that way for our entire meal.  The food was really outstanding. The prawn appetizer we had came with the most amazing sweet tamarind sauce. I could literally drink gallons of that sauce. The soup had the perfect mixture of coconut milk, lemongrass and spice. Our main entrees were great as well. Perfectly balanced flavors, everything cooked really well. The sticky rice with mango dessert was to die for. I also have to make note of the plating and presentation of each dish. So often places just skip this step when really most of us eat with our eyes before our mouths. The presentation here was stunning. Little carved vegetables, flowers, the works. It really made it a pleasure to eat.  I will definitely be returning to Thai Orchid next time I am in Edinburgh.",

A lovely lovely lovely place to eat traditional Scottish Thai Food.   All joking aside the food was scrummy (that means good to those of you who do not live in my world or use my lexicon). Scrummy I tell you!!!! The the green prawn curry - yum!!!! the red chicken curry - yummy!!! the pad thai - yummyerer!!!!   I confess I ate here on two occasions within a 24 hour period. It may have had something to do with the number of beers(gin and whisky) I have....I am not fessing up to anything.   The staff were nice and attentive. The place was clean and I will go again. Save yourself the anguish and do not look too far for somewhere decent to eat.",

    "text": "I say this is the best Southeast Asian restaurant in Edinburgh and possibly UK.  The location is a \"can't miss\" being so close to the castle.  The decor is simple, spacious (might be something to do with the mirrors), clean and feels more modern than other Asian restaurants.  Service is above average.  On to the good part... I had the Good Pow prawns for starter.  The sweet ginger, salty prawn and spicy chili sauce combination was a great delight.  The prawns are not big, so don't rush to share them with your companions.  For main course, I had the GAI PAD MAMUANG HEEMAPAN (a.k.a #26).  I was simply looking for something mild and didn't have much to expect.  It turned out perfect!  First, every ingredient tasted fresh: the vegetables were spring and the chickens were not.  Again, excellent balance of sweet, salty and spicy flavors.  My bill was higher than average Asian restaurants: 20 pounds including tip, without desert.  But the top quality meal makes this place worth indulging.",

    "text": "Back home in NYC I've been on a crusade to eat my way through all the Thai restaurants in an area neighboring my apartment which is absolutely flooded with them, so in the middle of my week-long vacation in Edinburgh, I had a craving for something comfortable and familiar. I asked around, specifying that I wanted something authentic and unique and spicy and quaint, and time after time Thai Orchid came very highly recommended -- so of course I had to give it a couple visits.  Seafood is featured prominently on the menu, so on my first visit that's pretty much what my friend and I stuck to. We started with the butterflied prawns stuffed with seafood and pork that comes in an egg-wrapping. Then we had the rice-paper wrapped prawns stuffed with seafood. Then we had the deep-fried haddock with peanut sauce. For entrees I'd never seen this offered anywhere else, so I just had to have it: Larb with ground duck! Then we had the mixed seafood \"Yum\" salad. Then we got the mixed seafood in a red curry and coconut soup with bits of egg yolk... Everything was really good. My friend doesn't like spicy food so I was forced to eat things rather \"mellow\" but the ingredients all stood out prominently, we both really enjoyed ourselves.... We really bonded over the course of the evening, we tried to the best of our abilities to keep our googly-eyed butterflies-in-the-stomach pining cuddling canoodling respectfully under-wraps, though there might have been a few instances of publicly-displayed affection, thankfully we had some amazing food to distract us and inspire us... I would definitely describe this as a great place for a date, if you and the other person are even ever-so-slightly adventurous.  For my second visit, I wanted to be a little more adventurous than last time. With a different friend (who, unfortunately, also doesn't like spicy food, damn it) we split the poached Monkfish with coconut milk and crispy onions. Then we had the fried Monkfish in a tumeric and tamarind and ginger sauce. Then we had the red curry Roasted Duck with tomatoes and grapes and lychees. Then we had Sliced Duck that comes with a salad of mango and red peppers and garlic and basil and chili peppers... This meal was incredible, super high-quality ingredients, beautiful presentation...  The service is all very friendly -- our waitress was beautiful, and the traditional outfits they wear is very attractive it doesn't look at all look like or feel like a gimmicky uniform... They offer a nice selection of red wine and white wine boy the bottle or by the glass... The atmosphere is relaxed... The decor is modern and chic but not at all overwhelming or inappropriate.  I could easily see this as my favorite Thai restaurant if it were a little more local to me, but instead I'll just hope to come back sometime soon... At the conclusion of my second meal here (which was also my last meal while in town), walking back to pack my luggage, digesting and downloading and decompressing, I came to a realization: all my meals in Scotland were excellent, it was incredibly surprising to me, I never ate this well in London, not even close -- I seriously cannot wait to return.",

Their menu is pretty lengthy and can be overwhelming but it's great that they offer many different choices.  My friend and I chose two dishes...gaeng massaman neua which is a traditional mild curry with beef and chicken with cashews. The dishes were solid, nothing extraordinary not terrible... Solid Thai dish that has the Classic Thai flavours I love. I'd say the portions here are smaller than other their restaurants I've been to considering the price is a bit higher.   The staff were all welcoming and nice. There was always someone checking up on us and making sure the food was good... If you like being left alone and not get asked how the food is every 5 minutes than you might get annoyed here. The decor is lovely and the place is small which makes it intimate. Make sure you make reservations since it's a small place. Overall this place is a solid Thai restaurant and you won't be disappointed with the food.",

The waitress said yes I can give you a table as long as you can be done by 8.30pm.  Not a problem!  She told anyone with no booking the time that they needed the table back by.  Some people may find this rude but I think it's better than being half way through your meal and being told to hurry up! I asked about the gluten free options and I nearly hugged her when she told me what I could have...every main course with the exception of 3, just wow!  There were six out of the 13 starters that I could have so we were on a roll before we even ordered. To drink my boyfriend ordered the thai iced tea with milk which may sound dodgy but far from it the flavours were perfect with what was ordered.  For starters we had the number 7 and number 8 (don't think these match the website exactly).  His was a marinated pork dish that was beautiful.  I'm not a big fan of pork but it was melt in the mouth tender.  Mine was a mince and peanut mixture wrapped in an egg net.  The egg net looked like batter almost so you expected a crunch but that didn't come until you reached the peanut.  Such an odd mixture that worked so well. For mains he ordered the Larb Issan dish with beef.  The only downside was that the spice was not quite as expected (it wasn't really spicy at all) but it was full of flavour and a very filling dish.  I had the Pedt orchid for mains which was verrry spicy and I loved it.  The mango mixed with the spicy duck was the perfect combination.  This dish managed to have lip numbing spice but yet have fantastic flavour which some places do struggle with.  At the end of this feast we were both stuffed and had no room for anything else.  When I'm back I will visit here again but will book a table to be sure! I would like to add from a non food point of view that the toilets were spotless!  This says a lot about a place.  Also while we were there a young couple came in with their teething baby and the staff cooed over the baby and distracted the baby as much as possible to let the couple eat their food.  I was amazed and so happy to have picked here.",

For starters we got the vegetarian \"golden bags\" with the plum sauce, which were delicious. I only wish we could have gotten more! We also ordered the spring rolls, which had a very smokey flavor.. Still good, just not the best spring rolls we've had.   We ordered 50 and 54 in the Vegetarian section. 50 had a yummy sauce, but was full of vegetables and lacking on the tofu side. This worked for me, but might not for those who aren't veggie fans. The other dish was a favorite, with another very tasty sauce and full of tofu goodness.   Overall, nice place to eat, great service, and I'd recommend the pineapple juice! But for the price, I'm not sure if it was as good as it should have been!!",

To start we had the chicken marinated in Thai whisky, soy sauce and sesame oil wrapped in a pandan leaf..umm YUMMM.  For my main I had the red curry with duck that had grapes, tomatoes, and lychees in it. I only found 1 lychee. :( The curry itself was delicious. Perfectly spiced and well seasoned but for the price I felt the portion was quite small, especially since you had to also buy the rice. It was a unique dish though, and I haven't seen it on the menu at any other Thai menu so I gave it an extra star for that. I felt like the food was quite tasty and perhaps for the location the pricing was right.   I will say that I saw a 3 course lunch menu for under 10 quid so if you're on a budget, duck by here for some basic Thai curry.",

On the menu, this dish is listed under the vegetarian dishes. We added beef to one dish and chicken to the other.  The portions were on the smaller side.  The biggest disappointment was there was no flavor!  It's like they forgot to add sauce or something.  Also, the beef was super tough. At closer examination, it looked like they steamed the beef and just threw it in the dish.  There was absolutely no flavor to the beef.    The mango and sweet rice was decent.  We left this place still hungry and disappointment.  I don't understand why this place had such high reviews. Maybe they don't specialize in Pad See Ew? I wouldn't come back here.",

I've been living in Edinburgh for a few months and this restaurant might be the best place I've tried so far. It doesn't have the most exciting ambience, but you'll get a great meal on the royal mile for a price that won't break the bank.   If you're here on vacation, you may have noticed that Edinburgh restaurants love to cater to tourists by displaying all that Scottish food has to offer. That's well and good, but, after a couple of days, all that heavy, rather unhealthy food can leave you feeling bloated and sluggish. Come to Thai Orchid for a tasty change of pace and work some protein and vegetables into your diet.  Cherry on top: When you ask for the check, the waitress brings you a yummy piece of chocolate with crunchy orange bits.",

Although we were seated promptly as soon as we stepped in, the waitress did not tell us that the restaurant has a policy to only cater if guests order the same number of dishes (main, starters and soup) as the number of people. So, we were forced to order 8 dishes. It is not that we wanted to save money, but we have been tasting local food and wanted to look for light dinner. At that point, we were too embarrassed to leave since we have already ordered some drinks. We felt like it's a RIP-OFF for tourists since the restaurant is located in the Royal Mile and near the Edinburgh castle. STAY AWAY! There are a plenty of better Thai restaurants in the city!",

The Panang curry was possible the best curry I've ever had. It was made with pineapple, peaches, and coconut milk, as well as red bell peppers. The flavors!! The Pad Thai was also very well made. We like our dish with a few more beansprouts to give it a bit of crunch, but the sauce was out of this world! Be careful of the pepper on the plate; it's super spicy!",
