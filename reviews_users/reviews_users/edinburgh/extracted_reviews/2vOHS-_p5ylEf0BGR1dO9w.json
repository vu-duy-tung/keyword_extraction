The staff put up with six of us arriving a few sheets to the wind on Friday evening, and humoured my request for a vegetarian burger with bacon and blue cheese (made of win btw!) without so much as a raised eyebrow. The wine was good, the chips were good, and everything was super tasty.",

Opted for the two-course lunch deal for 7.95, and was treated to a big bowl of the BEST mussels I've ever had, a steak sandwich, a huge bowl of excellent chips (fries to my fellow Americans), and a small side salad.  While the steak was a little overcooked for my personal taste, I can't exactly fault the kitchen as I didn't request it the way I would've wanted it.  But forget the sandwich for a minute and savor that tarragon, white wine and cream sauce in which the mussels were bathing.  Good Lord... I dunno if I'll ever want bivalves any other way.  This is quality food for a song with friendly service in an unpretentious setting.",

Night was ruined by waitress who took the hump after we asked not to be seated in the main room (we would have been sitting almost on top of other customers). Instead, we were shown to a cramped corridor through the back, which felt like punishment!  I couldn't pick the table I wanted (I wanted to sit at a table that was set for two but was told it was only for one!!! Then she said if we sat there, no-one would have got into the table behind us  no-one sat there in the time we were in and you could have parked a bus in the space). Then I had the audacity to sit down before I was told to and she complained to me for doing it  it was the most unbelievable display. It put us off our night out, although the waitress who went on to take our orders and serve us couldn't have been sweeter.We had steaks to die for but the damage was done. We didn't bother with dessert or coffee and so left within an hour of arriving. What we should have done at the start was to point out her rude behaviour but, as pretty laid back people, we were too stunned to say anything. Or we should have got up and walked out. But we won't be back and that's a shame.",

They never tried to \"upsell\" any other courses or items, they only pointed out the daily specials.   The burger is hands down the best I've had on my holiday in Edinburgh. The seasonings brought out the flavor of the meat and the local cheddar provided a wonderful accent. And then I had dessert... a classic sundae stacked high with pudding, toffee sauce, ice cream, and a dash of whipped cream with wafers.   My only regret is not finding Smoke Stack sooner!",

    "text": "The Smoke Stack is a strategically placed eatery in the Broughton Street area of Edinburgh that caters for meat lovers, ideal for family brunch, business lunches (WiFi available and pretty strong too) & pre-theatre dinner. My friends and I went there after a long day in a pretty ravenous state. I ordered the double burger plus bacon, jalapenos & Orkney Cheddar. The two patties were perfectly cooked, juicy and super tasty, a real treat! My mates went through a home-made Steak & Ale Pie with mashed potatoes, green beans and julienne cut carrots and a Chicken Fajita with the usual attached paraphernalia.  The Steak & Ale Pie was subtle in flavour but with character and the Chicken Fajita was hot and spicy but with enough \"room\" so the hotness was not masquerading the main flavours.  All in all it was a very positive (and affordable) culinary experience.  The service was adequate and a bit aloof at times as more attention to detail (aka: what-is-happening-on-the-floor) was needed.  The place interiors are really cool with stripped stone all encapsulated with a retro-style approach. Will certainly pay them another visit!!!",

It's got all the bland aspects of the restaurant scene down, uncomfortable cheap furniture. Uninterested staff loiter and especially on quiet days, really hate you being there. The menu is good in the respect that you can choice how your meat is cooked and what you have with it but this by no means \"tailor made\".  It's overpriced for what it is, somewhere to take your parents if they were in town or an old work mate that you're not fussed about impressing. It's an in and out affair with no atmosphere but it does fill a hole.",

Check with the steaks, not so much in the way of BBQ smokiness! I would have loved to have gone for one of their steaks but I felt for a Sunday casual lunch they were a bit over priced (in fact over priced any time of the day or week!). I decided to go for their rump steak salad with a soy and ginger dressing ordered medium-rare. The presentation was top notch and the steak was cooked to perfection! I really enjoyed the quality of the meat and the salad but I felt that there was far too much dressing which kind of over powered it and left everything drenched. It was definitely tasty but if I was ordering again I would ask them to go easy on the dressing. There is also a great selection of drinks, smooties and milkshakes. I went for the green machine smoothie which contained broccoli, spinach, celery and apple which I thoroughly enjoyed!",

    "text": "Smoke Stack is an American style chargrill restaurant situated in Broughton Street.  It specialises in meat (steaks in particular) so if you're dining with a rampant carnivore, there will definitely be lots on the menu to please them. The menu features four different cuts of steak and six different sauces to compliment them. Portions are pretty large and if you go for a weekend brunch, your meal will set you up for the day. In particular the all day breakfast is brilliant, you get massive portions of beans, Crombie's sausages, bacon and eggs served alongside slabs of tasty bread (there's no cheap white sliced here), all for a meagre 6.95. The menu generally represents good value for money, the pre-theatre menu served between 5-6.30pm is only 9.95 for two courses.  The decor could probably do with a bit of an update, what was once 'modern' is now looking a bit nineties. However the staff are friendly and the service is really good, you'll leave with a full tum and a smile on your face.",

    "text": "a rainy sunday afternoon (which ironically reflected the mood i was in) i found myself wandering down broughton street to the smoke stack for a lunch meeting...or a lunch date, i'm not really sure what it would be called.  either way i was here for lunch.  on arrival at 1pm the restaurant was totally empty save me and the guy who told me to pick any table and brought over some menus.  i was a bit concerned about this as an empty restaurant usually means the food isn't that great.... i started wondering if maybe i should text my lunch date to let him know this and ask if we should move to treacle.  however, i stayed put and when my lunch date arrived we took our time deciding on what to have.  i believe that the smoke stack has a specific weekend menu that has an offering of brunch all day.  while i was initially tempted by this, i was also tempted by the burger or steak sandwich.  too many choices and being indecivise made us send the waitress away with just a drinks order, mmmm ginger beer!, while we thought a bit more.  i ended up with the steak sandwich and my date the chicken club.  we had a wee wait for the food after our order which was reassuring that it was being made fresh.  and when the plates did come out neither of us were disappointed.  my steak sandwich was literally a steak on ciabatta!!  a whole steak!!!!  usually this sandwich is some thin slices of steak served with lots of fried onions to mask the fact that there isn't that much steak.    after a quick assembly of the two halves and making sure all the fried onions were secure in the ciabatta i took a bite and yum!!  the steak was tender and the onions nicely caramelised with a hint of mustard mayo on a nicely toasted roll.  it was supremely tasty!  maybe not the best i've ever had, but definitely very good.  my chips were fresh and crispy and i ate them all after taking on the majority of my sandwich.  my date's empty plate clearly reflected that he'd enjoyed his chicken club as well.  while we were waiting for our food and eating the restaurant began to slowly fill up, so maybe this is just a later lunch spot and i was an early bird turning up at 1pm.  the service as well was very good, although they seemed a bit cautious of our table as i was visibly upset and i don't think they wanted to interrupt.  i really need to stop being the girl that cries in public places... but well done for their professional service during my upset and not making it obvious to other diners what was going on!  so this place gets 4 stars as i would like to go again (maybe in a few months when they forget about my most recent tearful visit!) and try some other options on their menu.",

The whole concept of Smoke Stack is a good one. I love the exterior, it's very American-esque and the interior matches up nicely. We went for a lunchtime meal, one that would probably double up as dinner too, so we decided to go all out and have the 8oz Scottish Sirloin, which was part of an 8 lunchtime meal deal.  My steak came, medium well as I'd asked for it, with garlic butter and thick cut chips. Taking my first meaty mouthful, I have to be honest and say it was beautifully cooked, I couldn't really fault it in any way, except from the fact that I really don't like steak that much! It's just too much meat for me, way , way too much, and I struggled to finish the lot. My boyfriend had no problem helping me out though.  Overall, the Smoke Stack is great for those of you who love a big fat hunk of cow on your plate, but next time, I'll be trying the prawns I think.",

I was so curious to see what a chicken and bacon crepe looked like so I ordered. My imagination couldn't prepare me for what was put on my plate. It's exactly as strange as it sounds and if you insist on ordering, remove the Crepe ASAP, otherwise it will absorb the bacon grease. Strange, but tasty.  Not a bad at all.",

For main we had burgers and  ribs, nice enough  although portions were small and a chicken special on mash which was disappointing. The pudding, Bannoffe pie had lots of cream and banana but just a scrap of toffee, still it was delicious .  .   Our main disappointment lay with the bar. We ordered drinks which arrived minus one, we asked about this twice and were promised it was being made, which it clearly wasn't as we could see the girl serving at the bar preparing drinks for others. Drink arrived 25 minutes later.  We tried to order more drinks but were unable to catch the waiters eye and eventually had to go up to the bar to ask. The girl from the bar brought them but failed to take away any of our empty glasses from  the table which was crowded. Although not rude she appeared sullen and disinterested . The lack of attention to detail spoiled what could have been a pleasant afternoon.",

The chicken fajita had plenty of sauces, but it somehow worked and tastes good. The coconut fish curry was ok, but the salmon was slightly on the tough side.

Just like everywhere else in Edinburgh, some waiters & waitresses tend to be slightly abrasive at first but then they're nicer. A little smile goes a long way!  Well we came a second time and our waitress was much nicer. She recommended the green machine smoothie and said her 10 year old son loves it. And it really is refreshing and amazing. It tastes like a smooth blend of vegetables & fruits.   We also had Sausage butty & Sausage cheese & egg bap. They were both lovely and the most important thing is that the sausage is from the butchers down the street. That is lovely To hear and you can taste the freshness! But I'd still pour some caramalised onions on top instead of just in the sausage.   This second visit made me up the rating by one star. So this is a 4 star place for me now...oh shot I just saw our previous unfriendly argumentative waitress roll in, she probably had a fun night and had trouble waking up. I'm glad we missed her haha :)",

I ordered steak fajitas, because it sounded amazing, though it was 15. So what, if it's good. The problem is that it was only ok. My friend's ribs were too fatty and he only ate some of them. His burger was small, and matched with tasteless pinkish tomatoes. He said he would never go back, and so while we enjoyed the ambiance, and the company, there is little point of spending what we spent for a meal that was less than grand.  The staff were amazing, cute and sweet, and checked in on us a few times. If the food were only as good.",

    "text": "What happens when Edinburgh's most deadpan bartender meets my most under-the-influence colleague on a Thursday evening?! It takes him half an hour to order a drink, that's what. They may as well have been talking different languages. Well my colleague might have been; the bartender was mostly impassive.  This is more of a food place, but we spotted a cocktail menu in the window so dashed in for a drink and some shelter from the monsoon outside. I ordered an Old Fashioned and thought it was a nice touch that he asked me my choice of whisky (out of two, but it was appreciated!). I settled down at one of the high tables by the bar counter with another colleague who was keen for a bit of a deep & meaningful, and we pretty much forgot about the other two guys we were with for the next 20 minutes as we were deep in conversation. Eventually we realised 1) our drinks still hadn't arrived, and 2) the other two still hadn't managed to order. Confusion all round.  I eventually got my drink which was unfortuantely quite watery, and I'm not sure what my colleague got but it didn't taste like any Manhattan I'd ever tried. I think the other two eventually settled on beers. So it ended up being a good chat spot for me, but not the most successful drinks stop, hence the low rating for now. I should probably come back for food though and give it another shot. I would also urge you to mind the step up to the street right outside - as one of my colleagues learned the painful way in his eagerness to bundle into our taxi afterwards...",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that the day we arrived in Edinburgh it was about dinner time and our taxi driver suggested the place to us. It was right by our Airbnb and we were very tired so it seemed like the best option.   The atmosphere was very casual with paper placemat-like menus and a small venue. The staff is incredibly friendly and the service was very attentive and prompt. Almost everything on the menu made my mouth water. Since we were starving we ordered a TON of food and boy did we get our moneys worth.   For starters we has the mussels and calamari. The mussels are some of the best I've ever had. Typically I'm not a fan of food like mussels or oysters but I'd eat Smoke Stack's mussels for every meal if i could. They were served in a delicious sauce and it had bacon too (this I was timid of but it proved to enhance the dish dramatically). The calamari was also delicious, but the mussels beat it out overall.  In between we ordered their special cocktail of the day \"Party Remy\" which I was shocked to find how incredibly smooth it was. The mixing of the drink was splendid and I'm interested in coming back to see what more they have to offer.  For meals we (there were three of us dining) ordered a burger, steak, and rump steak salad. Again my taste buds were spoiled with how incredible the meals were. The burger was incredibly cooked and decorated (the menu offers an assortment of deluxe toppings) and the chips tasted like they had just come out of the fryer. The rump salad was absolutely delicious as well. Perfectly made and dressed while perfectly cooked rump meat was lain on top of it. The best meal out of all three was the sirloin steak. I got it medium style (it arrived perfectly cooked) and with a side of baby potatoes and macaroni and cheese. The macaroni and cheese could be its own meal in itself because of its large size. I'm extremely picky about macaroni and cheese and this batch passed my test with such high scores I took more home in a take-out box. The baby potatoes were also delicious and got a take-out box for themselves too.  I wish I could have saved room for dessert, but I was absolutely stuffed because we underestimated the proportions when we first ordered.   Overall I will probably eat here at least once per visit to Edinburgh because you get 5 star food (and A LOT of it) while also having a friendly casual atmosphere. We enjoyed dinner so much we are planning to go again tomorrow. Well done Smoke Stack!",

    "text": "Too bad - it could've been so nice.  Sunday morning brunch is sometimes a special hangover time and you want to be taken care off. Well in my view anyway. The promise of a fresh waffle with bacon and maple syrup with a Bloody Mary was music to my ears. Good thing that I didn't actually had an hangover otherwise I would have been really annoyed during this visit.   The owner / manager showed us to our table. Which was nice, close to the heater. He took our voucher for the brunch and asked if we wanted coffee or tea. - huh? I sometimes like simple, non fuss choices this wasn't one of those moments though. I did find out from the drinks menu there were slightly more choices, but I got the idea that on the voucher it was either coffee OR tea.  When our coffee & tea arrived I noticed no sugar on the table - or any table - so it was something that should have been served with the order - so I got up to ask the waiter/owner/manager for some and promptly he did bring some. - It should really be served with the Coffee & Tea (since that wasn't really that complicated of an order to start with)  We ordered our waffles; mine with bacon and maple (?) syrup and the wife scrambled egg and salmon. The waffles were of the very thin, round Tefal waffle-maker variety. Shame, as I was expecting a nice thick square Belgium waffle. But yeah a waffle we did get. The bacon was OK and crisps, the syrup tasted golden NOT maple and very little was served.  *sigh* here we go again..  I had to ask waiter (non owner / non manager) for extra maple syrup and some butter to moisten the waffle. - which was not offered nor were we asked if anything was to our satisfaction.   The Bloody Mary was big, nice. No celery stick, not nice. - and here I went again.. this time asking for Worcester sauce and white pepper. - no white pepper on the premises - but celery salt was offered - thanks.   Too many times I had to ask for additional things that you'd expect to be on the table or served with an order. - that staff was not easily approachable. I did try from my seat, but to get things I really had to get of my seat and go to the bar/serving/kitchen area.   It was in all a bit of an disappointing visit. it is difficult to complain about having to ask for something and if it was only one thing fine.. but so many things that needed to be asked for was very annoying.",

    "text": "I had walked by Smoke Stack on Broughton Street many times, and I had been wanting to try it for a while now. When a Groupon voucher came up for two breakfasts, two orange juices and two coffees/teas for 10, I jumped at this great deal.   A friend and I showed up on Sunday, really excited to try Smoke Stack. The orange juices came out, and I was really disappointed that they were the horrid British orange juice from concentrate that pops up way too often to make sense. I just don't know how people drink the stuff and why they tolerate it! I had expected some nice freshly squeezed orange juice but was sorely disappointed. At least my cappuccino was fairly good and compensated it.  With five different types on the Smoke Stack menu and with waffles dominating all of the breakfast options, I thought I was in good hands since that was what they seemed to do best. My friend and I each had the waffles with bacon and maple syrup. The waffles weren't terribly hot and were served with the maple syrup already poured over everything - an obvious mistake since it drenches the waffles and makes them soggy, and also doesn't let us customise how much syrup we want, or the quality of the pouring. I'm sounding like a snob here, but it seems really easy and logical for me to serve the syrup in a nice little pitcher so that customers can decide if they want syrup just in the middle (like I received) or evenly distributed in each waffle dent. Anyway, the waffle was ok but nothing special, especially when soggy with the maple syrup.   I was just really excited about trying Smoke Stack, and really disappointed that they hadn't done better. At least I was on the deal since it certainly wouldn't be worth spending 20 on brunch here. Also, I was a bit annoyed that the servers weren't friendly at all, and they also hid us away downstairs even though I had made my booking weeks ago and had assumed we would have had a nicer table upstairs. Oh well.",

While visiting Edinburgh, I had planned to go to at least one steakhouse based on the reputation of Aberdeen cows so I stopped by the Smoke Stack. I was able to walk right in since it was still early in the night. Service was pleasant and the atmosphere was nice and modern. I ordered the filet and mash. Price was good for a steakhouse, but not cheap. Also ordered garlic bread for an appetizer. The bread came out in a timely manner and was good. The filet also came out in a timely manner. The first cut into the steak was like cutting into butter. It was more than tender- words cannot describe it. The taste was also out of this world. The mash was also good as well, but I was left speechless with how good the steak tasted (you shouldn't speak with your mouth open anyways, but you get the point!) This is a must go!",

    "text": "A wee Wednesday night dinner with a friend after a visit to the very expensive German Christmas Market. We saw the food the people were having next to us and decided to have fish and chips. The fish was huge, so large I could only manage half which is annoying because I hate to waste food, particularly food that comes from another living entity. The fish was fresh in a lovely crisp batter, well drained and piping hot. Best fish I've had in a while. The chips were chunky style, but crispy, accompanied with a sweet pea puree and tartare sauce. Really enjoyable although I note other reviewers have had lukewarm experiences. I had a glass of rose wine with my meal that I didn't enjoy so much. The seating upstairs is a little impersonal as you're sitting very close to the next table.",

    "text": "Full disclosure, I am from the Southern part of the United States. Fortunately I have been to plenty of restaurants named \"Smoke Stack\" in my life. The expectation I have is that the food would have some beautiful smokey flavour. Unfortunately this place does not meet that expectation.  The location and atmosphere are great, which is the only thing saving this place from a 1 star. The price is high for what you're getting. I got the ribs, which had never come close to a grill or smoker. They seems to have been boiled in too much sauce, and reminded me of the McRib. My wife got the prawn and avocado salad. Prawns were completely unseasoned and the avocado was a wee bit past it's prime. The highlight was the elderflower martini.   One last thing I would like to add...FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE THE BLOODY MARY OFF THE MENU. That was a joke in poor taste to the wonderful drink that has saved me from many a hangovers. I believe it has cranberry juice in it. Disgusting.",

    "text": "Went to Smoke Stack to have a Sunday brunch with my husband. We had an itison voucher which offered waffles, coffee/tea, and a Bloody Mary or other cocktail.  Booked table for 12 as the small print mentioned the licence law, which meant that our Bloody Marys could only be consumed after 12.30..  On arrival the place was almost empty. The orders were taken, but I was slightly surprised that there was no choice of coffees or teas - I would have maybe gone for a cappuccino but never mind. The drinks arrived with some milk on the side.   Then a while later, the waffles arrived. i had waffles with smoked salmon and scrambled eggs, and my husband chose bacon and maple syrup waffles.  They were ok, nothing special though.   Bloody Marys were brought to the table, and again - nothing special.  At this point I really realised what annoyed me about this place is we had to constantly ask for something:  - there was no sugar on the table - asked for more maple syrup and they brought a small jug of what seemed like golden syrup - asked for white pepper for the bloody mary: the waiter then asked if we want black or white?? and only then did he mention that they had celery salt which we took and it complimented the drink  All in all, ok place but I wouldn't perhaps rush back.",

    "text": "It has more of a diner come canteen feel to this place which in all honesty I didn't mind as I was ravenous and in the need for a tasty plate of nosh.   The place was quite busy but the service on point. Although the waitress didn't seem to know the menu too well and had trouble understanding what Stolichnaya was.  As a buggy-barer we typically have to call in advance and ask whether firstly they allow wee bairns in and then whether they can accommodate us. Top marks on this front.   Now for the food. It's good. Not blow you out of this world awesome nor is it worthy of a stinking review. It's nice. A little more of a shake on the season pot wouldn't have a gone a miss but all-in-all I was hungry, it filled a hole and there wasn't anything massively to complain about.   A good place to drop in if you're hungry and need a relatively quick fix I would say.",
