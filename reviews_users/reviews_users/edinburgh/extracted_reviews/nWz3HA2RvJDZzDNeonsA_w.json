    "text": "What can I say? It's a modern, spacious Nando's. It was a bit noisy yesterday but that is to be expected as it is in the Omni which seems to be the top hangout spot for Edinburgh teens.  It was really busy when we arrived but we managed to get a table and it quietened down once our food arrived.  I had the butterfly chicken with chips and corn on the cob. I decided to go for medium spice instead of plain - good decision! Much more flavourful than when I used it order it plain.  I suppose I seem a bit brutal giving it a 3 stars for an enjoyable experience but it's a Nando's for Christ's sake!  One issue I have with Nando's is that they do not offer free wifi which in this day and age is very annoying.",

I'm not a huge fan of nando's and have never got what the fuss is about. I got the butterfly chicken, chips and coleslaw. The chicken was really dry and I always find the fid lukewarm.",
