    "text": "I love the Globe. I work round the corner. I'm feeling grumpy with overwork at the moment so though it's 3 a sandwich, I'm splashing out on their gourmet treats fairly regularly just now. Lunchtime sandwich of the moment is a brown sunflower seeded roll with mozzarella, pesto and roasted peppers on it.   Their coffee is great. I ate a very fine almond croissant from there this very morning. They have a giant selection of juices, fizzes, sandwich fillings, salads, soups and smoothies. You pay for it all right enough but if you want an exquisite sandwich, this is the place.   My only complaint is that the staff are a bit grumpy. But it may just be that they don't like me.",

    "text": "5 stars for the food. For definite. I adore the selection of sandwich fillings that they have in here. And the soups? Oooohwho needs tea and coffee when I could sit and drink these all day (and probably pile on the pounds too unfortunately). The choices of soup change on a daily basis, and are always fresh and delicious.   The Globe wins hands down when it comes to fresh healthy food. Even their selection of crisps is unusualroot vegetable, parsnips etc. Unfortunately the food comes with a healthy price tag too. So it didn't quite become my daily lunching venue - despite being just round the corner from my office. But once a week or so, I'd treat myself and indulge!",

    "text": "Another fantastic place to eat lunch on the Shore. The sandwich fillings are excellent, really good selection and particularly good guacamole!   There are plenty of spaces to sit in and eat, which don't usually all get taken at lunch time. The staff are friendly and will build any sandwich you desire!   The coffee is ok, nothing special. But the sandwiches more than make up for the average coffee.   Unfortunately there is no free wi-fi at this deli - that is the only thing I can fault it on.",

    "text": "Have to agree with other reviewers. This is a deli that does stand out among the others in the area.   You choose your bread and then take it over to the counter to choose a filing. Add soup, a drink and crisps and that adds up to a very tasty lunch for about 7 or so.   We live in area so tend to treat ourselves to a take away lunch from here about once a month.   Light and airy, lots of papers and magazines to flick through and plenty of seats and tables.",
