    "text": "I am a newcomer in Edinburgh and I live near by. I tried Guru for the first time today (take away) and I am definitely a fan and will be coming back often. The lamb passanda that I had was superb! I tried the garlic naan and it is huge as others also say. However, I think it could have been tastier. Next time I will try the Guru naan. I also tried the tandoori chicken from the starters and it was also very good.   Rating: Food quality which is what really matters is a 5 out of 5. Price-wise though it is a bit expensive for take away; I would give it a 4 out of 5. The staff was also very friendly; 5 out of 5 easily. Overall the first impression is a restaurant well worth 5 stars! (I am rounding up a little bit; it is worth it as it is so close to my flat.)  I will update this review periodically with further recommendations.",

    "text": "The naan here is no joke.  I had dinner by myself and the naan they brought out was the length of my forearm.  The manager mentioned \"we made a special sized piece for you.\"  Wait, did I get shorted?  As a matter of fact, I did.  The \"regular\" size is like a large pizza!  I still had more than plenty. I had the madras chicken and some okra.  I asked the manager to give me some guidance to get something spicy, but not hurt myself.  He was very capable in giving that guidance.  Dinner was fantastic.  I punished myself by finishing all of it, nearly licking the bowl clean after I polished off the naan.",

    "text": "I've had 2 takeaway meals from here on separate occasions and have enjoyed both. I've ordered online for collection and both times the service I received was excellent - friendly staff and timely receipt of food. I've had one chicken dish and one vegetarian dish, accompanied by a naan. The mains were packed with flavour (not hot spice, which I'm too wussy for) and were good-sized portions. The naans however are another story altogether - ginormous! I had the Peshwari Naan both times and was possibly the highlight of the meal, especially as I had leftovers to accompany 2 more meals.  Guru Balti also have a nice-looking sit-in restaurant, although both times I have visited to collect my takeaways, it has been empty (mid-week evenings).",

    "text": "Guru Shati is a pish takeaway that Falsely advertises on Groupon to make a quick sale.  This place sold Groupon vouchers on the pretence  that they deliver all over Edinburgh.  Only when you go to order they won't deliver anywhere further than the end of their street .   When phoning to complain not only did they not apologise but they said it was not their fault at all.  Erm I think you will find Guru Shati that it is entirely your fault for not checking the Groupon before they were sold.  Or maybe you really are just robbing bams who will do anything to make money.   Avoid this dump.",

    "text": "I have been to the Guru Balti a few times, over several years. It can be summed up as offering good quality meat and above average curry, though the hotter dishes tend to lack that real zing of back end heat. They have some of the best and biggest naan bread though their rice doesn't particularly stand out.  The restaurant tends to be fairly quiet through the week, making it a good choice for post cinema eating if you happen to be at the nearby Cineworld. Guru is a good choice for an Indian meal and if you live in the area it should probably be your Indian restaurant of choice.",

    "text": "Guru is right down the street from my flat for the summer, and I've passed it on many occasions without stopping in. My mistake! I adore Indian food and feel very lucky that this one is in my neighborhood. I ordered takeaway and it was ready to go so quickly. The portions are huge. I got the vegetarian platter for 2, and we have enough leftovers for another full dinner tomorrow. Their Benghan Bharta and Saag Paneer are very different than what I get in the San Francisco area, but I love both styles. The naan (I ordered plain and garlic) is amazing, but I wish I had read previous reviews that mention how large they are. The size is honestly impressive. I have never seen naan that big in my life, and the quality is great. The samosas are really delicious too. The highlight for me was the Guru chutney selection and the raita. I love chutneys and I love raita, and Guru does a fantastic job on both. I'll be ordering from here again.",

    "text": "Gur Balti is an amazing Indian restaurant on Dundee Terrace which consistently offers delicious food and great service at reasonable prices.  I've been here twice with some friends and both times we've gone away more than satisfied with the whole experience.   They pride themselves on serving some of the best Indian food in the city and each dish is presented immaculately.  The menu has loads to choose from and the last time I was in I went for the Balti Chicken Passanda.  It seemed to take no time to arrive and tasted creamy with a great range of flavours.  All the meat which they use is of the highest quality and you can definitely taste the difference in all their meat dishes. We all spent no more than 15 each, including drinks, rice and tips, and we'll hopefully be back sometime soon.",

Some of their dishes are really good: the tarka dahl is rich and thick, the saag paneer is delicious. The meat curries tend to go a bit same-y for me, but they're OK. The menu's massive, though. The naan bread are the biggest I've ever seen. Perhaps leans a bit too far on the quantity side versus quality, but I'm probably spoiled by living next to Southall in London.   A very popular Edinburgh eatery, and in the evening the tables are often full. Staff can be a bit of a laugh.",

    "text": "The Guru is a traditional Balti restaurant on Dundee Street in Edinburgh. It is run traditionally and there is always a struggle to get a tabel if you dont boook in advance as it is quite a small place.  The menu is extensive with all the favourites korma, Jalfrezi, Rogan Josh and a good few speacialities. The food is fresh and very tasty. A main course tends to be about 8-9 and then rice on top of that. The sides are great and the nan bread is huge - DO NOT get more than one!  The staff are excellent and do their best to make sure you have a great time, they are very humerous.  Also it is bring your own bottle with a cheap corkage charge which helps cut the cost of eating out.  On the whole this is a great place to go either with a group of friends or for a nice romantiv meal it really is excellent!",

It is at Guru that I learned curry doesn't have to be burn your gob off spicy; their lamb passanda is absolutely gorgeous. Their nan breads (my favourite part of any Indian meal) are absolutely humungous. It's a very very small restaurant, with only a few tables, but the illusion is that it is bigger by having a full size mirror across one wall. I would definitely suggest booking a table if you're in the Fountainpark area and give this place a whirl. Mmmmm!",
