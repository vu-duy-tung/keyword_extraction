    "text": "As was pointed out by Marj. C, this place is a take away, not a cafe selling yuppies continental coffee and croissants. Instead think chips, greasy pizza's and kebabs.   To be honest, i Have only ever been in here once - and found that its just a standard counter and see-through glass box thing where the food is kept with a few chairs.  The real glory is the fact you can order your food online and have it delivered. And what food it is - the kebabs are not your  usual grease drenched dog leg, they are well cooked and as far as I can tell - pretty fresh and good quality. The chips are good too, as are the prices - but be warned, while I am praising this place for its online service - the actual staff are a bit moody and often rude.   Still, you come here for the food, right - and thats good!",

    "text": "To say this is a cafe is a bit misleading - it's a takeaway. There are a few metal chairs and tables inside, but unless it's three in the morning and you're drunk I can't see why you'd want to sit and have lunch in here. I'm not usually a fusspot but it's hardly glamourous.  Ally's serves up your usual token takeaway foods. Kebabs, chips and pizza are all glorified in here under the strip lighting. You get hit with a waft of the latter as you stand at the door, and my heart almost gave out just at the smell of it. It's a bit of a greasefest.  I bit too heavy on my belly on a summer's day, maybe it would've been different if I had a blazing hangover and was in need of something ridiculously unhealthy but also satisfying. I don't like takeaway as much as I used to and even though it wasn't bad for what it is, I'd much rather settle for something of quality these days than cheap kebabby thrills.  For a takeaway it's alright - I wouldn't steer clear of it. It's cheap enough and if you order over 30 online you get a free bottle of coke. But this wouldn't be my first port of call if I was looking for some grub. Not my last, either, but nothing to write home about. Cheap and comme ci comme ca, I could take it or leave it.",

    "text": "Disappointed with this place.  Have tried a few times to give them the benefit of the doubt, but too many times there have been problems.  The latest problem being they had run out of something (called me to tell me), then an hour late I called to see what was happening and the driver had been stopped by the police.  When it finally arrived, I was expected to pay for cold pizza.  I'm fed up with this place quite frankly.",
