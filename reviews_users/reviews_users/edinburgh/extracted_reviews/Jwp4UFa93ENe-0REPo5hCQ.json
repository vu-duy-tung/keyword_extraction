    "text": "My family were up visiting for the weekend so I thought we might head somewhere a bit fancy and posh for some delicious seafood. After much umming and ahhing it was agreed we would head to Cafe Royal (the restaurant, not the pub next door). What a crying shame we did.  We arrived at the restaurant (which is stunning! beautiful and full of character and history) at 8pm (as per our reservation) to find it empty bar one other table of Japanese tourists. To be honest alarm bells did ring at this stage, but I thought ah come on give this place a chance.  We looked over the menu and decided some would have a starter, some wouldn't and my siser and her husband opted for the seafood platter so assumed a starter wouldnt be neccessary.  I began ordering with the waitress (who I might add kept making a strange gurning face at me every time I spoke) and said we'd like 1/2 dozen oysters to share to kick us off. This seemed fine. I ordered the black pudding for a starter and a bowl of mussels for my main. The waitress then continued to ask me (at least 5 times) what I was having for my entree.... this caused no end of confusion, as far as I was concerned the oysters were our entree, she then kept saying how very small the portion of black pudding was and wasnt really a starter more of a taster (which turned out to be absolute rubbish, the portion was a great starter size). The exchange ended with me stating quite firmly that I was quite happy with the choices I had made and that she please move on and take requests from the others. All a bit stressful really.  Our oysters arrived..... there was a dissapointed silence around the table, I have never seen such miniscule oysters in Edinburgh. I ate at Fishers by the shore a week previously to this and we were served big, fat lovely oysters, 2 of those were enough for a starter! My mum made a timely comment at this point that it was clear they are buying very cheap and inferiour produce and selling it at sky high prices (8 for 1/2 I believe...). Very dissapointing. My black pudding was delicious, I have to say, a great portion size, cooked brilliantly. Top Marks. My mussels were also great, but lets face it how hard is it to get a pot of mussels right?! Every pub in the city will knock you a bowl up for under a fiver pretty much.  A point I almost forgot to add was the waitress leaning right across me (there was plenty of room for her to get around the table) to deliver my mum her main course which was an overcooked anorexic seabass apparently. My sisters seafood platter arrived, and looked great, plenty to go at and decent portion sizes. Unfortunately the lobster was very overcooked, a great shame as it is not currently in season which means they must have it shipped in from god knows where, at what cost, to do horrendous things to it. The potatoes were not new and looked like something you might receive upon ordering loaded skins or similar in a pub, there was no rosemary in sight. My sister highlighted this to the waitress and she was told that as she had eaten a fair bit of it there would be no discount, but we would be entitled to a free pudding. We declined and thought best to just leave the restaurant to head home..... via the chinese. Overall a complete dissapointment.",

    "text": "I had not been to the Cafe Royal Restaurant and as a friend was coming up for the weekend I thought I would give it go so booked a table for a bunch of friends. The decor as expected was captivating which made the eating experience even more disappointing. I do not think I have been to any restaurant where I have been unable to eat my meal until now. The first course failed to stir up my taste sensations and was lack lustre to say the least. The bread did not arrive until our starters and that's only as I had to ask for it. Then came the main course. The first time round it was over cooked and cold, coldness seemed to be a theme. I sent the main back and the second time round whilst it had not been overcooked it was bland and was not at all enjoyable. I also ordered mash potatoes and these were also bland and lumpy..i actually added butter and seasoning and tried to remash them to make them edible but failed miserably. I absolutely love puddings but simply couldn't face another let down. On the plus side the waiter, Fraser, was extremely good at dealing with our disapointment and my main meal was taken off the bill and we were given a bottle of wine. Our complaint was handled well, but I booked this restaurant for an eating experience and was completely let down. With prices as they are, you expect to be fed food at least on a par to what you get at home....this wasn't anywhere close! I will not go there again which is a real shame.",

The food was fine, but nothing outstanding and given the price, I expected something a little more interesting. On receiving (and polishing off their mains in under 2 mins) the members of our group who order scallops enjoyed it but were left hungry and feeling short changed. We went there on a work trip and when I first sat down I hoped it might be somewhere that my husband and I would go on a special occasion, but I certainly won't be returning there especially if I'm paying!",

First of all the bar is very impressive, a circular bar in the middle of the pub. The tiles on the walls also look very impressive and tell a story, there is also a good selection of beers and the bar is frequented by a good cross second of society. What disappoints me is the service, or maybe I just stand in the wrong place but it always takes me ages to get served.",

However, after my visit today, I can confirm that I have never in my life received such disgusting service in any restaurant/pub I have visited. Our main courses took an hour to arrive and after asking what appeared to be the manager where our food was, we were told that she had already cleared our plates away. Informing her this was the starter, we asked to have our food soon or have our money back. We were then told that it was our fault it was delayed as we had 'moved tables'. Having been sat in the same spot without as little as a bathroom break, we were understandably puzzled by this. After complaining in a reasonable manner we were told we couldn't have our money back, only the money from the main courses that weren't delivered - no apology was offered. We were then asked to leave the restaurant, hungry and disappointed. Don't go here unless you're looking for frankly disgraceful service and mediocre food.",

The ale behind the bar is always in good nick and the service there is generally very good and we found this to be the case in the restaurant too as we were looked after by a particularly professional pair of wait staff (in fact the only negative for the whole visit really was the rudeness of a fellow diner who took no responsibility for causing our waiter to spill a whole caffe latte over the end of our table thereby putting the restaurant in the position of giving us a 3rd cheese board for free). No one raised an issues with the food (for my part the beetroot & goats' cheese salad, fish & chips and very good cheese board were all of a high standard) and the 1kg of mussels was especially well recieved. Definitely one of the jewels in Edinburgh's eatery crown.",

    "text": "I have to say that the Cafe Royal has to be one of my top 3 bars in Edinburgh.  You will pretty much regularly see me in there, either with friends or family.  My mum has always been a fan, from when she used to work at the Civil Service nearby - and there certainly are many regulars, (probably a lot who worked/still work for the government!) who have been going for years and years!  You will pretty much see some form of politician in there at some point but don't let that put you off!  It has the most lovely oval bar in the centre (it is, in fact, not the original bust still lovely) - and the tiled painted decorations of various Scottish famous people around the room is lovely.  It's always busy - as it is a famous landmark of Edinburgh - so you're lucky to get a seat - but if you do get a seat at one of the round booths, even if you are sharing with others - it's even better - and you always end up talking to some random people!  It's a great place for people watching. In a way, it has a similar vibe to the Crown Bar, in Belfast - which is now owned by the National Trust - but a great bar, so different from those around it!  I've only tried the bar food which is really nice. Saying that some days are better than others! However there is the Oyster Restaurant next door, and part of the Cafe Royal - does look stunning if you fancy a special meal.  The bar  selection is very varied and the rose wine selection is lovely.  Would highly recommend visiting if you've not been before!",

This noisy, comfortable bar is tucked away behind Princes Street and is the destination for many weary hacks and businessmen seeking an after-work drink. As you see the Evening News and Scotsman laid across the bar, it's tempting to flick through the stories and try to identify their authors.   Like the Horseshoe in Glagow, the traditional wooden bar dominates the centre of the room as customers fit round its edge in plush booths or by lean-to tables. The pictures on the wall, the exotic plants by entrance and the painted mirrors decorate the bar subtly and in good taste.   The range of drinks and their prices are reasonable without being remarkable - it's the decor and interesting company that you come here for.",

From the front, it reminded me of my beloved Rogano as it shouts out seafood (and oyster bar in particular) and champagne. I went in and found it so gorgeous inside - beautiful ceiling detail with the cornicing, oval bar and little booths around it. I was only in less than an hour but it seems to attract an afterwork crowd - good and mixed of all ages which for me is the sign of a great bar. Great choice of drinks - didn't try food but the chips that went passed looked and smelled fab so I intend to return and sample food!",

As such, it is especially fun for a special occasion, but it really isn't the kind of place I find myself frequenting on a regular basis.  The beers are priced exactly as you would expect them to be in such an opulent setting, and the selection isn't terribly extensive, but is perfectly acceptable.    I've eaten here (in the bar) twice.  My fish and chips were amazing and I was thrilled to be given my very own bottle of vinegar so I could overdose as much as I liked.   My second eating experience was not quite as pleasurable.  The food was highly praised, but it was the service which has knocked off a star.  There were two of us, so we each ordered food.  However, when only my meal showed up, we asked the waiter about our other order.  He said he would check for us, and never returned.  I was appalled.  We waited 20 minutes before I finally went up to the bar because no one would make eye contact with us.  I explained the situation to the person who finally helped me, including the fact that we told our waiter what had happened and he never came back.   The saving grace was the fact that that member of staff literally ran down to the kitchen to see what happened and then sent us a free round of beers to make up for it.  This I appreciated SO much because it was a recognition that the original waiter handled the situation very poorly.  It is a shame, really, because every time I have come here the service is the only down point of the whole experience.  Despite that, the rest of the experience is really quite nice.     I've not eaten in the proper restaurant but my guy absolutely gushes about how amazing it is, so it looks like something I will have to try out one of these days.",

    "text": "This is my favourite bar in Edinburgh. Having been a student up there many years ago, and visited Auld Reekie at least once a year since leaving - I've spent many a happy hour in this utterly beautiful pub.   Inside the tiling is impressive and something you just rarely see anymore as it's been ripped out of so many older pubs.   The massive wooden central bar is an absolute beauty and it's oval (well squashed circle) makes getting served a lot easier.   The little booths take a bit of getting used to as the built in seating is a tad on the small side, but nothing so as to put you off.   It's got a good range of drinks, a very friendly crowd and the service is excellent on the whole. It has a really good atmosphere with a mixture of those tucking into the newspapers and snacks and casually letting the day drift by, and those there to discuss the important matters of the day - whether they be politics, sport or whatever - but always over a great pint or a slowly rolled whisky. It's especially good fun if Scotland beat England in the rugby.   The sign outside has a lovely touch of the surreal with a lobster crouching on top of the sign. This points the way to the excellent sea food served within. There is a separate listing on Qype for the adjoining Oyster bar restaurant, which is also fabulous and well worth a visit.   The building was originally a showroom selling hi-tech gadgets of the 1860s, but rapidly turned into the pub we know today and not a lot has changed since. It has come under threat once from developers but survived - hardly surprising people tried to move in on it as its just off Princes Street and could have been the back of a prime retail site. I think I remember reading the last time I was up there that is is a listed building now so hopefully it'll be around for all to enjoy for a long time to come.",

You'll be alerted to the Cafe Royal by a large sign that is reminiscent of the mise-en-scene of Moulin Rouge. The Cafe Royal is in a beautiful building, and the room is indeed circular. There are big, lush booths to sit in, if you get the opportunity, but the tables aren't 1/2 bad either. There are a variety of beers on draught- but this is, surprisingly, limited given the hugeness of the bar itself- its in the center of the circle. The spirits are where its at, here. Its very lovely in that Moulin Rouge sort of way. There is a menu serving oysters (17.99-18.49 per dozen of various modes of preparations) and mussels on offer, so the fare is swank, and lovely. And there is a proper champagne sparkling wine list that includes a 115.00 Dom Perignon, and a Rose Lindauer from New Zealand at 18.99. This is the place to escort upscale arty's, or to splurge out on the fare. If the lack of variety of beer gets to you after a while, the Guildford Arms is next door in the same building and they have tonnes of beers on tap- including many micro-brews. This may be a first stop of the evening, or a long afternoon sort of place.",

Often have I admired its opulence from outside (like a little Victorian waif pressing up against the grubby glass to watch a family eat roast beef) but I definitely chose the right time of year to come inside for the first time - my goodness me. The opulence was raised another notch by beautiful Christmassy decorations - everywhere! Those halls were well and truly decked, but in superb taste. I felt that first twist of excitement at last! Yes, I am one of those who gladly will embrace Christmas preparations as early as October... mid-November is definitely leaving it late for me...  As I stood there chatting away with my 1.05 lime and soda (not the most expensive I've had, but not the cheapest) a glorious aroma filled my nostrils... and past my eyes floated a plate bearing beautiful, golden and crispy-looking battered fish. Oh, but it did look good.  I'll update when I've been back for food, but for atmosphere and decor, it's a firm and twinkly four from me!",

My son and I stopped by for a drink (thanks to Ian Rankin's recommendation in a Guardian podcast about Edinburgh).  What a beautiful place.  It is like walking through a time portal into the 1870s. A lovely gentleman at the bar -- a retired banker in suit and tie -- told us about the Cafe Royal and its clientele.  I would have stayed to eat but it was a bit too up-scale for the university student.  He felt uncomfortable in the elegant surroundings and was the youngest person in the Cafe Royal by at least 15 years.  The famed oysters will have to wait for next time.",

So lets review possible scenario  You are on a date/out with the Partner - cheeky pint of something local for him, lovely glass of red for her, sit in a booth or on one of the high tables and stare lovingly into each other's eyes while the non-obtrusive staff bring refills to your table, and you can order some nibbles to share.  Out with the parents or family - you want one of the booths, you could fit 6 around one of these. Mum can try one of their fine Gins, while you and dad work your way through the beer range. Old Dear starts talking nonsense? You can start talking about the beautiful design of the bar, the history of the tile art work, or just pick up a paper and ignore her babbling!  After work beers/ out with the boys/girls? This island bar is yours to conquer, elbow your way in and line the drinks up! Worth noting that there are numerous good boozers within a stone's throw - two more in the same building (Guildford and Voodoo)  This place is a great spot for escaping town, its really warm, but open, and the staff are very good. Their food is very good, renowned for seafood from the adjoining restaurant - though I prefer the burgers. They stock a lot of local produce from seafood, to whisky and beer.",

The Cafe Royal is steeped in history (love the word steeped, have been trying to find somewhere to use it all day), having been around in its current location since 1863. You can witness the evidence of the history steeping when you get inside and check out the stained glass and wood paneled interior, with the old fashioned bar and surrounding booths.  There are tons of whiskies and good ales to choose from, plus some really decent and hearty pub food options. The Cafe Royal is famous for its amazing oysters, and the restaurant section next door to the main bar has a really tasty, very Scottish menu on the go. A couple of other things to note - a restaurant scene from Chariots of Fire was filmed here, plus the place is apparently haunted, so ghost hunters, get yourself down here for some oysters plus spirit searching.",

Traditional Victorian pub yet at the more stylish end of proceedings, and tends to attract more of an after work crowd than other pubs in this category.   Oval bar in the centre, surrounded by booths with leather seats, tiled floor, ornate ceilings, brasswork, high windows, and the real highlight: tiled \"paintings\" of famous Scottish scientists and inventors. Absolutely gorgeous interior all round, and a place that no visitor to Edinburgh should miss.  Has the usual booze offerings with about 4 real ales on tap, so something for everyone. It's often referred to as the oyster bar because of its signature dish, which you can have in the bar or in the adjoining restaurant.   The only downside is that it gets packed out most days in the early evening or on weekend afternoons. But fear not. It's next door to another fine Victorian pub, The Guildford Arms. Two of my favourite pubs in Edinburgh, right next door to each other. Isn't Edinburgh a great city?",

I did not find them appealing.  At all.  But i'm probably too stuck in my own expectation.  Don't order oysters 'Natural' expecting something like Hog Island Miyagis or Kumamotos (*sigh*).

In fact, it's so tucked away that unless you went on a mission to find it (or got lost in the city's back streets) you could quite easily be unaware of its very central existence.   There are two parts to the Cafe Royal - the bar and the restaurant, both are equally wonderful. The bar has a wide range of malt whiskies and an excellent menu (including the famed Cafe Royal Oysters, try them Rockefeller style), however it is usually incredibly packed - you would be very lucky to secure a table for yourself, most of the drinks I've had here have been at the bar. The restaurant is an oasis of calm compared to the bar. The food and service are both exceptional however this is reflected in the price of the menu.   The Cafe Royal is worth a visit just to check the decor of the bar, it is incredibly ornate with exquisitely painted Victorian tiles on the walls, stained glass windows and expertly carved wooden panels. Bring tourists and out-of-towners here to impress them with the style and quality of Edinburgh's drinking holes!",

We initially walked by the restaurant early in the morning before it was open and were looking at the menu when a gentleman came out and asked if we wanted to come inside to see it. We were pleasantly surprised and came inside and asked if we would reserve a table for that evening. The only time that was open was 9:00pm on a Sunday because they had a large party coming in that night. However, this was not a problem for the staff at all, it seemed. We were not rushed at all. We had a fantastic dinner. I wish I could remember our servers' names because they were AMAZING - everything was perfect. Food was delicious, wine was great! We were a bit of a loud table (we were celebrating a birthday!) and the table next to us was clearly not enjoying our presence, but our servers made a point of telling us not to feel badly about this, which was really nice! Cannot say enough great things about this place. Would absolutely recommend dinner here if you're in Edinburgh - it might the best meal we had in Scotland!",

The \"restaurant\" part of the Pub is off the main bar and is small with only a few white linen tables.  It's a charming Pub with a warm and comfortable ambience.  We shared a bottle of wine with oysters and the fish stew which was very good; the frites (also called rooster chips) were excellent.   Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Our first night in Edinburgh, exploring the streets where we were staying, we stumble across a backstreet, five minutes from Edinburgh Waveley Station, and this lovely traditional pub and oysters bar.  We went in for a night cap and vowed to come back again to have a meal. It's a fabulous Victorian building and became a listed building after it was almost sold to Woolworths, so they could expand their stores. Luckily, planning permission was denied.    On the blackboard outside, we saw some special pre-theatre deals, 2 courses for 14.95, and 3 courses for 17.95, available between 5pm-6.30pm, Mondays to Thursdays. These are only for dining in the restaurant.  Unfortunately, we could not take advantage of those since we were there for the weekend, so we came back for lunch in the Bar.  Our ethos for this weekend was to do everything for free or as cheaply as possible, that was our challenge!  So lunch at the bar would have to do. There were plenty of booths round by the window side of the bar which obviously gets filled up pretty quickly, so we sat at tables on bar stools on the opposite side and the other side of the bar, which was just as pleasant.  Sitting high, you could see everywhere!  For starters, I took advantage of the oysters and champagne deal, 3 oysters and a glass for 11.95 or 6 oysters for 11 which the guys did, as they had ale.    The oysters were absolutely delicious, fresh, natural, with a squeeze of lemon.  However, did wonder why the flesh were so small compared to the size of the shells?  For mains we had the Cafe Royal Fish Stew (fresh seafood in a rich tomato and basil sauce), Tagliatelle Pasta (with fresh crab, chorizo, chilli & prawns, in a tomato sauce), Scottish Salmon & Caper Fishcakes (with wilted spinach, poached egg & hollandaise). All done to perfection and tasted superb.   A fabulous treat after climbing Arthur's Seat earlier in the morning, and a 20 minutes walk from Holyrood Park, pass Parliament and the Museum of Edinburgh, and across the North Bridge, or underneath the bridge, through Edinburgh Waveley station.",

The bartenders were friendly, but service was kind of slow and they seemed rather distracted. They had some good brews on tap. I had the Goldihops by The Kelburn Brewing Company and Draught by Williams Brothers Brewing Company. Both were decent brews.   The food was good when it arrived. (For bar food, it was decent) The atmosphere was busy, but not loud. We were able to relax after a busy day of walking around. Finding the place was a bit of a trick. We had to find a small alley by the Royal Bank of Scotland to find it.",

Drink prices were average and the best thing wasn't so noisy I couldn't hear the other half.  Generally, bars for me can be nightmarish as the noise of others can drown out the company of whom I'm with, but Cafe Royal surprised me.  I can't remember if they were playing music or not, so perhaps that was one reason to why I could hear my other half.  This bar is suitable for anyone, and it's wheelchair friendly too - not too sure about the toilets though.  The bar staff are particular y speedy with sevice so we didn't have to wait long at all for a our drinks which is a big thumbs up.  My only nit-bit and it's small is why salt the chips and give you more salt and pepper?  I rather salt my own chips.",

The decor and ambiance inside the pub was unlike any that I've ever seen before - really cool. The bartender was extremely cheerful and friendly. Didn't order any food, but the drinks were well-made. There was a good mix of people - some very dressy/formal, but most were dressed business casual or similar.   Had a lot of fun and made some great memories with the locals. Would definitely go back if I'm ever in the area!",

There is an air of grandeur about the building, a throw back to the heady days of Victorian splendour and  self-confidence! The bar itself is a fantastic oval type featuring stand-up lamps and plenty of seating around it. There are also seats down the left hand wall, but even so, due to the sheer popularity of this historic pub, sometimes there is standing room only. There always seems to be a buzz in The Cafe Royal, and it's a pleasurable experience just to sit (or stand) and soak up the atmosphere of the place.  The Cafe Royal also combines as an oyster bar which features several outstanding stained-glass windows. Must visit pub!!!",

Let alone the ornately carved wooden fireplace, large mirror, high ceilings, and six huge ancient tiled murals on one wall.  From what I read the murals were done by and artist named John Eyre, and done in the 1880's, and later purchased by the bar when they opened.  I love pubs with a history, and this has it.  There is a bar area, and a separate dinning area in the back.  The bar is where its at for me though.  They have four cask ales, and a full menu so you can eat at the bar if you want.  One cask is always Deuchars IPA, the rest rotate.  A variety of  Kelburn and Stewart's Brewing have been available on my visits.  The casks are in good shape as well.  The food is great.  I usually have lunch here after walking around Calton Hill for a few hours.  Awesome seafood options.  The oysters, and mussels are top notch, fresh, and local.  Last time I had a Sea Bass Chowder that was excellent.  The chowder itself was good, but the huge fresh prawns that came with are amazing.  This place is great, and a pretty central location as well.  Very easy to get from the station at Waverly, Calton Hill, or even the Royal Mile.  Guildford Arms is right there as well, so a good spot to start a pub crawl if you want to explore the Rose St area.",

Their muscles and oysters were fresh too.  During the second visit, I had the Cullen skink, which was quite nice and different to ones that I had in the past, as they had blended the haddock into fine pieces. The waiter had recommended a lamb special, so I tried it out and was pleasantly surprised. The lamb chops were very tender and they also provided a very nice fresh mint sauce.  As for desserts, I was amazed by their summer berries crumble. It was mildly sour and quite sweet (just the way I like them).  Overall, I strongly recommend coming to this place, I'm definitely coming back when I return to Edinburgh some time in the future.",

    "text": "As a lover of all things that have a historic significance, the Royal Cafe was a terrific find the other night to have dinner with friends.  I had seen it on my travels around town but could only get in on my final night in Edinburgh.  This historic pub almost met it's demise back in 1969 as a hotel bought the property that it stood on and they were ready to sell it to Woolworth's to be torn down to make a parking lot.  Well thank heaven the city and neighborhood got involved and blocked that sale so that today, people can still enjoy great food and drink in a historic building.  Take a close look at what look like paintings on the walls- they are really a collection of Dutch Delft tiles that combine to make a series of large pictures.  Really something!  They are known for lobster but I chose to have the salmon wellington which was like a deconstructed pot pie and was delicious.  My friend had the surf and turf special of the night which was also good.  We also enjoyed some of their fresh oysters, on this night they were Scottish Rock, a type I had never heard of but tasted like some of the east coast ones I am able to get in the States.  Service was quite good and since it started raining during our visit- they even called a cab for us and we sat comfortably at the table until the cabbie came into the restaurant to get us.  Loved the atmosphere, the history, but most importantly the food!  And whether you sit on the bar side with the huge round bar or on the restaurant side- you will be sure to have a great night out!",

I usually expect duck dishes to be small, but the piece of duck I received was much larger than expected, and I was quite full by the end of the meal.

The situation could have been handled a lot smoother on their end and Peter's tone and comments were not necessary.",

Food was excellent, Champagne was bubbly and the staff was super friendly! Highly recommend getting the Scottish Beef pie. The 3 oysters and 1 glass of champagne for 15 pounds was a great deal too :)",

I honestly could not choose between dishes and was famished so I went for the Seafood Tower and the Venison. Thankfully, although brimming with lots of ocean delicacies, the tower is lots of shell so it didn't fill me up. The Venison was tender and delicious on a bed of red cabbage and red wine jus.",

    "text": "So let me give you a background -my boyfriend, his parents, and myself were staying in Edinburgh for 8 days. We went to 4 different restaurants the first 4 days - either ones that we found on Yelp, ones recommended from travel videos, and others recommended from blogs. Some were downright awful. Some were just okay. Some were WAY too overpriced for what they gave.  My boyfriend and I came to Cafe Royal one night because it was recommended by our Airbnb host. We ordered haggis, mussels in white wine, mushroom risotto, and pork pate. All tasty dishes and our waiter was awesome.  Next day, we went to dinner with his parents to a DIFFERENT restaurant. It was not good. We came here to Cafe Royal for dessert and drinks- cheesecake, cranachan, and crumble of the day were tasty with our lattes.  We visited YET AGAIN the next day (yes...3rd in a row)- this time for dinner. Ordered king scallops, salmon fillet, and duck. We were so happy because FINALLY we were getting good food- and not just good, but EXCEPTIONALLY good food. And great service yet again. This time-we ordered creme brulee for dessert and it was delicious.  So what did we do the 4th night? WE WENT BACK TO THIS PLACE YET AGAIN. Yes, ladies and gentleman. We were just so tired those first 4 days of being disappointed by our food at other restaurants. So tired of going to highly recommended places and being let down by the meals and the service. So thoroughly impressed by this place where EACH and every meal did not disappoint us or rob us by overpricing their meal, and so satisfied with the atmosphere and service- that we went to this place...4...out of the 8 nights...we were in Edinburgh!  All in all- if you are visiting Edinburgh...you must visit this place at least once. Beautiful stained glass windows accompanied by delicious food. I am aware this restaurant has tons of history behind it too.  5 stars.",

I enjoyed my ales, and our bartender was very helpful with recommendations and samples.    The Victorian architecture is also a feast for the eyes.",

We had two beers and tried the haggis nachos. They were pretty interesting I'd say. I've definitely better nacho chips but I liked they added a Scottish spin to the dish.

There are loads of tables and table tops to sit down at, but this place was mobbed, it being a saturday evening and all.  Everything is decked out just now for the holidays, which made for a festive wee drink here- especially since I ordered a holiday cider they had in bottles (rekorderlig winter cider) which was very tasty!  We were able to get a wee spot close to the door to have our drinks and chat about the day before heading off to the next pub.  One thing to mention, the toilets are downstairs below the pub, so watch your step coming up, there's a wee lip of a step as you're heading back to the pub area that both me and my guy managed to trip on.

Oysters on the half shell were fine if not a bit small.  They are offered multiple ways but we chose \"natural.\"  Had haggis for the first time in their bon bon appetizer.  As the saying goes \"anything deep fried...\" but in all seriousness these were really good.  Nothing funky about it at all and I look forward to trying it elsewhere.  My other half had the 7oz aged angus filet which she enjoyed.  I tried it and it tasted a bit too gamey for me but that may just have been my palette tonight.  I enjoyed the perfectly cooked sea bass filet over seafood risotto.  Service was very attentive and seriously apologetic about the reservation mishap.",
