    "text": "Went in last night with friends. Only half full at most, and that was 8pm Saturday night. Served straight away. Went for the beer box, and at first ot seemed a bit limiting to only have 3 veg and one main meat/fish, but it turned out lovely. Had water chestnuts, peppers and one other veg which to my shame I can't recall, with extra ginger and garlic, all mixed up with thick udon noodles, and a spicy schezuan sauce, with shui mai dumplings for a starter, and a bottle of their house beer, though you could have had Asahi. All very pleasant, quick and good. From entering, we were all eating within ten minutes, and we all enjoyed it. Pretty good value at 9 a head. The dumplings were a little salty, but I'd just had a cocktail, so they disappeared quickly. The main noodle dish was hot, filling and better than I would have made at home. It's not spectacular, and it's definitely aimed at Western tastes, but it's quick, good value, tasty and yes, they have those little boxes we've been watching American TV & film people eat out of for years.",

The deal is, it's a bit like building your own sandwich, but it's building your own noodle-fry (stir-fry?). First, you choose what kinda noodles you want. They have egg noodles, rice noodles, udon noodles, ho-fun noodles, and probably some other sort that I cannae put my finger on. Then, you choose a meat: beef, chicken, prawns, et all. Then, you choose vegetables. There are many vegetables and you can choose whatever your heart desires. Bamboo shoots, broccoli, peppers, etc. Then you choose a sauce: satay, oyster, szechuan, black bean, etc. And then, about five minutes after you've done all this, voila! You have foods.   I was kinda disappointed in the black bean sauce. It was just kinda boring, to be honest, but today I had satay sauce with prawns and broccoli and ho-fun noodles and it was yuuuummy. I'm half tempted to get some more on my way home, for dinner.   Ok, so it's no Suzie's (as has been mentioned before, yes, about a 30-second read above this), and if I had a choice, I'd bring Suzie's back, but I can imagine they're going to do well. If only because it's quick, it's central and affordable enough for students.",

It feels a bit like Oriental fast food and you simply go up to the counter and request your noodle dish exactly as you want it.   They have a wide range of noodles, all of which I had never heard of.  You then choose which meat or vegetables you want to go with it, and finally the sauce.  I had beef with the oyster sauce which cost only 5 and tasted amazing.  All their portion sizes are filling and any of their meals make for a delcious, value for money lunch.",

Ohhhh, sweet Red Box, just across the road with your black pepper sauce and meats and veggies, you are magic.  I can't praise the Red Box Noodle Bar enough. For a mere few pounds you can have a box of nuclear hot (in temperature) delicious, custom made noodles. It's a simple idea - choose a noodle type from a list of six, choose a meat type from a list of six(ish), choose three veggies from a big ol' selection and then choose a delicious sauce - black bean, red thai, satay or my own particular favourite, black pepper, to name just a few. You pay five pounds and thirty pence and five minutes later a perfectly sized box of delicious noodles arrive. You can eat in or out and it costs the same. There are a selection of starters to choose from - prawn toast, won tons, spring rolls, etc, and a range of beverages - Chinese beers, soft drinks, OJ and water. It's simple and highly effective.  My only complaint is really a statement of wonder - how in all of the world do they manage to get their noodles so hot that they stay hot for about ten minutes. A friend of mine now opens his noodle box on his way back to the office to let the noodles cool down on the way home.  Great, five massive stars from me and an uber high-five.",

What's changed since last time? Well not a huge amount to be honest - the restaurant still feels like a grotty cafe and the food still hasn't exploded my tastebuds but you know what? Compared to its peers Red Box offers great value - especially when you haven't got time to wait around for your food to be prepared - last night both orders were ready within three to five minutes of ordering.  Although it's never quite planned, whenever someone comes to Edinburgh to visit we always seem to end up at Red Box, and judging from how busy the place has been every time I've been there I can't help but feel that lots of other people find themselves constantly gravitating towards it too.  I'll keep going to Red Box for now, but I'm still expecting something great to happen with the food before that elusive fifth star appears.",

Your selection is then cooked and served in a standard noodle box piping hot.  By default Red Box provide chopsticks but they don't mind giving you a fork instead (love the food never mastered the eating implements) and they offer a decent range of meal deals (various starters\\soft drinks\\beer).  The joy is that you can essentially craft the meal you fancy (more importantly avoiding the stuff you don't) and normally the service is pretty fast, Red Box does get fairly busy at lunchtime but I have always manage to fit in a visit easily within the lunch hour.  One little aside, the sign for the toilets is a little naughty if you stop and think about it...  In conclusion good food, freshly cooked, if you like noodles you can't go far wrong with Red Box.",

You can also sit in, but it can be difficult to get a place at busy times. Chopsticks available, of course, though I'm a lazy Westerner so always choose a fork.  The portion sizes are great! I never leave hungry from Red Box for this reason. The food tastes good. You choose a type of noodle, a meat, veg, and a sauce, and the food is prepared fresh and ready for you in about 5 minutes. Simple, and effective. I think the price is a bit steep compared to similar lunch options in the area, but the food is good enough to justify coming back.",

On this occasion  I got cold treatment while placing my order and felt totally rushed. The noodles were very tasty and still great value for a small box (which just about fills the spot). They could improve this place though. Firstly, who wants to listen to annoying and fairly loud pop trash while they're eating?! And the atmosphere is a bit cold. The floor and furniture is adequate but a wee bit worn looking. I wouldn't go as far as to say dingy, but could benefit from a bit of TLC. Toilets are a bit manky too. If though, like me, you're after a cheap grub while out n about then you probably won't let this put you off. I wouldn't make a special trip though. Time persevered with chop sticks on this occasion: 2 mins (Luckily they have forks!)",

    "text": "I'm having a noodle love affair! Everyone I've brought here has fallen for Red-Box, just as I did, and comes back time and again. Even friends from out of town have clamoured for a trip to Red-Box at some point during their visit, and I'm pretty sure that's not simply to escape my notorious cooking. The variety of items on offer means that there's something for everyone, and you can either develop your own personal favourite or experiment with something new every trip, knowing it's going to be freshly cooked right from scratch there and then.  The concept behind Red-Box is simple but effective; along the lines of a Subway for noodles, customers pick their base (noodle type), key filling (meat) and extras (vegetables, sauce, and seasoning). Large signs near the entrance explain the process and different noodle types to beginners, and then you just head straight on in and compile your dream meal.  Brilliantly located and never less than delicious food, this is a regular lunch-spot for me. The titular red box arrives at lightning speed just minutes after ordering (everything moves fast in this place, including the queue) and, TARDIS-like, contains piles more nosh than a conventional understanding of spatial dimensions ought to permit.  For those patrons choosing not to take away, the restaurant is clean and functional, although not particularly stylish in its minimalism and the stools can get little uncomfortable. The service is as one would might hope for from a fast-food restaurant - brisk but polite - and the pricing with noodle boxes starting from little over 5 is extremely good value given the sheer quantity within. A drink can boost the price considerably, though; while you'd be hard pushed even when buying a starter and beer to spend as much as 10, the comparative added expense of drinks does mean that Red-Box can be a less competitive option for a full meal than some other fast-food outlets, based on price alone. Of course, if you're taking away and have your own drinks sorted, then I can't see a single reason you'd go anywhere other than Red-Box to get your food.  Noodle me. Noodle me good, Red-Box, my love.",

I asked whether they use separate cooking apparatus for veggies, and despite a positive response, I feel dubious. The food and sauces didn't feel particularly fresh, the interior was quite dirty, and the staff ignored me when I asked for anything after having ordered the meal.  The taste of the noodles isn't bad, though it isn't amazing either. There is far too much sauce and far too little fresh ingredients. I went to soba bar last week and got a really good serving of fresh noodles, which was admittedly smaller, but far more satisfying in terms of taste.  If you want a lot of food for a good price, this is the place to come. If not, I advise you to go elsewhere.",

A super fast-service noodle bar where all the ingredients are cooked fresh in big pans behind the counter and it is cheap and cheerful.  You choose what you would like from a selection of noodles, sauce, meats and vegetables and can also add a starter or a beer on really cheaply too, only for an extra 2-4. I had the chicken satay and pork dumplings and they were both so yummy - love the novelty of eating out of a box with chopsticks too.  If you plan on sitting in it can get quite busy, so you might need to wait on a table, but it is well worth the wait. You can also do takeaway and as service is so fast, you would really not notice the way.  I would recommend on sitting in the first room though near the front door - it doesn't shut on its own, so with the number of people walking in and out the door was often left open so it was quite chilly.  Perfect for fast, fresh and cheap but very yummy food.",

Maybe because I grew up cooking Indonesian and Thai food, maybe because I'm just really picky about my noodles, or maybe because I'm blind as a bat (or rather my taste-buds are) but no. I just can't, for the love of me, understand what people like about this place.  It's clean, it's well-lit, but that's about it for me. The sauces taste factory-made and cover any of the flavours a well-wokked dish should have, the satay is nothing like a proper satay (and I've been making my own satay with the help of my Indonesian Nan since I was 7 years old) and it's just no! I'm not saying you shouldn't go here, I'm just saying it doesn't taste anything like what I expect proper noodles to taste like.  Okay, so it's fast food, quickly prepared and I understand why that's attractive to people. But I've eaten here four or five times now and not a single time have I not had the impression that eating cardboard covered in the same sauce would have the exact same taste. It just doesn't tick my boxes.  I'm sorry Red Box, I just can't say I'm impressed with you at all.",

    "text": "If any of you have been to Amsterdam and tried one of the many Wok to Walks that seem to be on every second street over there you will be pleased to know that Red Box has taken the idea and moved it to Edinburgh. Imagine a Chinese version of Subway, where you can choose your noodles - including ramen, ho fun, udon and others. After that you move onto the meat (or veggie option) which has chicken, pork, beef etc and as an added bonus king prawns are no more expensive. To finish you choose from a selection of veg (bean sprouts and chinese cabbage and others you would expect to find) and a sauce. I would recommend the oyster sauce, apparently I have since been told that it is a huge libido booster but you'll be thankful to know that the effects are not instantaneous.  As well as the main dishes there is a choice of about 8 sides, with the won tons and chicken satays being of particular mention. These come as part of a meal deal where you can choose a side dish, a main and a drink for 7.50 (the mains on there own are a fiver). They also do a loyalty card offering increasing rewards the more you go there, including a surprise treat after 15 visits. The portions are very generous and I was left full but not with that feeling that I often get after a Chinese where I feel like I can never look at it again or I might just explode. This place is going to be a huge hit when term starts again so definitely check it out now whilst you still can",

And I was very happy with my serving coz it was massive and steaming hot and was all round goodness. I opted for rice noodles with four veggies and the singapore sauce. Yum. Very nice indeed.   But Red Box has to stick to three stars at the moment because I sat in and the place was FREEZING. There are no seat backs on the chairs so your back gets sore. And it all looked a little dingy and I felt the eating section needed a bit of a scrub. So although the food was really pretty durned tasty, the experience of eating it wasn't so fun.  Ideal for takeaway though! I think I will definitely be back here, just not on a cold day or to sit in.",

Where there was mega-healthy vegetarian food before, now its all noodles and lovely-smelling sauces.  But the amazing flavours aren't the only great thing about this place. Its simplicity is by far it's best quality. Not only does it mean that queueing time is kept to a minimum, their build-it-yourself system means that fussy eaters will always end up with something they like. If they don't, it's their fault because they chose what went in.  You start by choosing your noodle type; off the top of my head I remember seeing rice noodles, egg noodles, udon noodles and ramen noodles  on the list, but I'm sure there were more. Next you choose your meat, between chicken, pork loin, beef, king prawns or duck (or none at all, for all you veggie types), before picking from about ten different types of veg. Last but not leat comes the sauce, and I can personally recommend the satay!  And all that for only 5! An absolute winner. I can see this place being mobbed once the students come back, so I plan to make the most of it before then.",
