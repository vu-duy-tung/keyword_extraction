It would have to be a long flight because he would have to learn a lot about my future plans, and what I want to do with my life.   Here's an intermittent transcript of his half of our conversation:  -Edinburgh?! When I was a boy... -You remind me a lot of my daughter... died. -Teacher, are you? Well... -Such a bright (young) woman...  -A bar - in a library? What an innovative and brilliant concept!... -Books? On the wall?... -Two floors? Winding staircase... hmm... -Desk lamps on the table?... -Serves coffee and tea during the day?... -Cheap beer and mediocre food at night?... -Ahh... I see... -Yes. Like a local... a place where you know everyone... -Like Cheers!?!?... -Oh no? Not like Cheers. -Hmm...  -I love a good investment... here's two million dollars. Good luck to you.  -No, no... I don't need any updates... -Send me a postcard...  -Let me know you're happy...  Unfortunately the Library Bar has already beaten me to the punch. I will have to take my idea and pretend it's original elsewhere.",

Bar certainly caters to the college crowd and you'll find plenty of cheap lagers here, with 1-2 more craft beer selections. If you want some really affordable beer and food, this is the place to be.",

    "text": "A nice bar in the Students' Union at Edinburgh University. The Library Bar is sumptuous to look at, with beautiful old bookshelves galore. The bar is set over two levels, with a very narrow spiral staircase going between them. There are also two smaller rooms off the main bar with more seating, so getting a place should rarely be a problem. Drinks prices are good, compared to other pubs in the area, although certainly more expensive than other University Student Unions. There is a decent selection of beers, and of course all the wines and spirits you could want. Atmosphere is nice, staff are generally efficient, and the location is good. Will be back.",

So being a good student, I went on my first week and got a present surprise.  Now I go back every so often, part for nostalgia, partly as its a pretty nice bar in a lovely building. The bar is split over two levels with a beautiful spiral staircase connecting them. Which is so much fun to try and get up and down when your drunk. Its also a pretty nice spot to bump into hunky uni lads.   Drinks are an ok price, certainly not bargain bin student discount good. That being said the staff are nice, and its a present place to spend the evening.",

    "text": "Why didn't my college have one of these!?  Okay, maybe that's because we have a puritanical 21 year old drinking age and our exorbitantly priced universities would rather give bonuses to administrators than subsidize student boozing. (Whoops, I think I just answered my own rhetorical question.)  But what a place. The food is three stars on a good day but very cheap, as are the beverages. The old wood-paneled spaces have a grand feel to them and the little spiral staircase on the end charmingly connects the two floors. I came with a grad student friend and we were back again a few days later.",

I'm here after peak time and there are still some shows on here till late. There are plenty of tables upstairs and across the hall from the library bar, but as there are a tonnes of folks passing you every minute it will be interesting even if you don't do a show, to celeb spot!  In all a fine venue to sup a beer, cocktail, grab a bite to eat, see a show or just mingle with friends pre or post festival event?",

    "text": "First off, you must be warned: Do not eat the food here. Seriously. I mean, ok, that might be a bit too harsh. I may have got them on a bad day, but they managed to overcook the pasta to the point that it crumbled in my mouth. In a bad way. Also, don't order a Bloody Mary. They don't understand what it is. I'm fairly certain the last time I did what they gave me was tomato juice with black pepper. And that's it.   But, as far as university bars go, the Library Bar is the best one. It's also the one that looks least like a hole. It's got lots of pretty old books lining the wall. But beware! You're not allowed to touch. They're such teases.   To be completely frank, the best and possibly only good thing about this bar is that it's really cheap. You can get a pint for about 2.50. And their range is ok. I mean, could be better, but not totally disappointing.",

    "text": "Situated in the picturesque students' union building Teviot, the Library Bar (not to be confused with the Library Cafe!) is one of the nicer student bars operated by the Union, which makes it a little bit more expensive!  It's aptly named, as there are old, valuable looking books encased in glass cabinets, spanning the two floors of the bar. The food served here is quite wholesome, and though there are snacky options such as nachos and duck springrolls, they also serve a range of impressive pasta dishes and I would certainly recommend their burgers; big and juicy with a generous side of chips and salad!  The bar is extremely cosy and is richly decorated; maybe a bit strange but the first thing I picture when I close my eyes is A LOT of polished wood! It's also great for events, as I've been to a university ball there.   This is one of the few university cafes/bars I would recommend to the average Edinburgh tourist, because the food here rivals that of any other in town, especially for the price, and I could spend hours in those comfortable chairs... maybe even fall asleep!",

First of all, it's a bit sprawling and has two floors, which makes it easy to find a place to talk more privately with a bunch of friends. Also, the decor is amazing - the rooms are lined with bookshelves (hence the name....) which makes everything feel quite classy. Drinks are a bit pricey, and it can be difficult to jostle your way through the crowd to the bar. It's worth it, though! The pizza is also quite good.",

    "text": "Really good food (burgers, pizzas, pasta, nacho menu) you would easily pay twice as much for anywhere else in town.  The library burger in particular is quite nice, as are the pizzas, though there can be some inconsistency in the quality of the pizzas and pastas.  Beer is also well-priced with a decent selection, and the atmosphere is classy, with 2 levels and comfy couches if you wish (and if they're not taken!).  It can get quite busy in here, it being in the student union and all.    The downsides are that the food quality can vary a bit more than I would like - e.g. pizzas not being done exactly right, pasta sauce slightly more liquidy on certain days - and the tables never seem to get wiped/cleared promptly, or at all sometimes.  Overall, I find it hard to convince myself to go eat out anywhere else, as it will cost twice as much for similar-quality food, and I love the ambiance!",

    "text": "Within Teviot there are a number of bars and the most popular has to be the Library bar. It only came into existence a couple of years ago when it was decided that Teviot needed a new classy bar. Since it was open I have to say it has become one of my favourite student union bars.  Spread over two levels, with a spiral staircase connecting the two, the Library Bar has a rustic, old library look with a slightly more modern looking bar. The majority of the bar is dominated by dark wood furnishings and many, many books in the glass cabinets.   The bar opens really at midday when you can order lunch, food is then served till quite late at night. The food is good for a student bar, but at times, service has been slow and sometimes the food has not been as hot as it should be!   However, apart from that drinks are at student prices and additionally you can order cocktails which are slightly more expensive. The bar has acoustic open mic nights, a quiz night and you can play board games, ranging from Risk to Trivial Pursuit!  This bar is always lively during semester time and does not disappoint!",
