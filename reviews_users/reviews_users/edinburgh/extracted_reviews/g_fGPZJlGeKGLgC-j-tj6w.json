Until now I would have told you that I'd rather eat rattlesnake.  Appearantly in Scottland, there is an entirely different species of mussels.  We stopped in at the Mussel and Steak Bar for dinner before walking up to the castle for the 10:30 Tattoo.  Our travel mate ordered the mussel starter.  It arrived with green sauce on it.  OMG, it smelled amazing.  So much so that I had to taste it.  The little mussels were tender and steamed to perfection with a light pesto sauce driselled over them.  It is such a great combination!  I had the surf and turf for dinner.  The mussels were done in white wine and garlic and the ribeye steak was tender, juicey and cooked exactly as I ordered it. All four of us agreed that our meals were delightful.  The price was not out of line.  Service was spot on.",

They were also happy to oblige my dairy intolerance, which was nice. Both the seafood and steak were good quality, but I guess they were just a bit boring.   Boyfriend wasnt so keen on the strange warm, limp cabbage on the side of the steak. Although the steak was cooked as ordered (medium-rare) which was good. The queen scallop starter was OK, but the scallops were quite small and over-salted. Mussels were pretty good.   Overall a decent meal, but not good enough to get us over to Grassmarket on a regular basis.",

Whether it was scallops, mussels, oysters or plaice, the seafood was first class and as fresh as the sea itself.  Steaks were also delicious, both ribeye and sirloin.  The wine choices worked well with the food and the choice of whiskies suited our need to try something different.   Staff were terrific. Attentive, friendly and showing real concern for our table.

The menu is pretty much as focussed as the name, If you are not a fan of seafood or steak then this likely isn't the place for you, however if you are then the Mussel and Steak Bar will serve you some tasty examples of both. The lunch menu is a little basic and uses the cheaper rump steak cut, however the price is fair for this and the mussels got a big thumbs up.  In short the Mussel and Steak Bar is a good choice if you fancy some surf or turf (or both).",

We popped in for a spontaneous lunch and were seated immediately by polite and efficient staff. While I ordered a duck salad for starter and mussels for main, my boyfriend went for the three course lunch deal. The food did not disappoint, as all was beautifully presented, arrived promptly and tasted wonderful. Only downside was that my initial excitement at the designated gluten and dairy free menus faded when my starter was served containing Parmesan slices, despite the fact I ordered dairy free and had double checked when served that my starter was dairy free. I ended up leaving the cheese to the side, and when our plates were cleared the waitress realised the error and was very apologetic. The rest of the meal went smoothly and the manager gave us a huge discount, so no harm done as my reaction to dairy is not severe, but even so I'm giving the mussel and steak bar 3 stars instead of 4... But overall lovely atmosphere and fabulous food, will definitely return to try the steak!",

The problems it causes when we each want our restaurant to provide something different. As a comprimise, we often decide that a restaurant serving British food is the best option - but then its time for the real battle to begin. Light and fresh sea food or good and hearty steaks?  It seems then that I should introduce them to Mussels and Steak Bar - which, as you would expect, serves Mussels and Steak.  Its no secret in the restaurant that the produce is local (or at least Scottish) and the ingenious menu combines seafood and heavy meats in brilliantly tasty ways. The sauces used are outstanding, if a bit 'out there' and incredably mouthwatering (In fact my mouth is watering as I type).  The restaurant itself is simple and practicle - and despite the annoying big screen TV's - has a seaside town feel to it,matching the down to earth cooking style. The staff are friendly and helpful, while the bar offers a large range of drinks.  So there you have it, a restaurant which can cater for all appitites and in a mouthwateringly excellent way.",

    "text": "Went for the 3 course lunch for 11.95, my first time at this place but recommended by a friend. Firstly I should add that I virtually don't eat fish, shellfish or steak. Uh-oh, not a good start with a name like the Mussel and Steak bar huh? I arrived at 1pm, downstairs was full, upstairs empty but rapidly filled up. The staff were nice and attentive. Food came in a timely manner...then it went sour.  Starter - Brie & asparagus tart. The cheese was warm enough to be highly greasy on a piece of soggy pastry hidden under some leaves of rocket. It was edible, but I think I've made better at home. If it had been baked a little longer I think it would have vastly improved. Main - wild mushroom ricotta ravioli. What was I thinking??? Still, if you don't eat seafood or steak that is the the veggie option. I never find ravioli to be particularly flavoursome and this dish was exactly that. The pasta itself seemed slightly undercooked and chewy rather than al-dente. The Parmesan on top had no taste and the tomato sauce was ok, but I think Lloyd Grossman does sauce just as nice for a lot cheaper.  Dessert - sticky toffee pudding. The pudding was ok, not the best I've had, but not the worst either. It's a light sponge with what I think were raisins and a separate sauce poured over. The sauce has a thin syrupy consistency, the kind poured from a large bottle from somewhere like makro or Costco - not like the kind baked with the pudding that turns gooey. A small ball of vanilla ice cream topped it off. All in all, I'd rate the food I ate as mediocre, I can't quite understand the rave reviews, but still what did I expect for 3 courses at that price? I also had 2 beers, West St Mungo, that were nice :)",

I saved myself for the 6oz rump steak which was awesome. The chips were chunky & crispy, just how I like them & the mushrooms were earthy & full of flavour. My steak was perfectly cooked, moist & melt in the mouth.   A colleague had the seafood curry. It was full of enormous mussels & other fishy delights. It smelled amazing & he said it was the best fish curry he's had. The only problem being that it took so long to arrive he didn't have time to finish it before having to get back to work.  Unfortunately the service was slow and I we all had to skip dessert & coffee as we needed to get back to the office (despite being there over 90 mins).  A lovely lunch with great food & company. It was a shame the slow service meant it was a wee bit stressful. The front of house staff were lovely maybe they just need another pair of hands in the kitchen.",

When offered a choice of 1.8 kg of lobster or crayfish, we chose the lobster thinking that we would get more meat from the lobster. Boy, were we wrong!  Marshall the owner, showed us their crayfish, which unlike their American cousins, were humongous! Anyway, we had the lobster, along with a big amount of mussels, langoustine, prawns, scallops and oysters, all cooked to perfection.  We loved it so much, we went back a second time to try the crayfish. Also ran into another group of tourists who was there for their second night in a row, so we're not the only ones that were impressed.

The service is good, the menu has a lot of choice and the wine very reasonable.   The good is great. From pots of mussels, plates of cooked scallop and oyster served on ice for starters, through juicy well cooked steaks and chips cooked in dripping!! If you have space left the desert menu is also decent!  Well worth a visit if you are in town.",

The steak was alright, I've definitely had better, but I will say that the mussels were pretty damn good. Very flavorful and piping hot when they arrived at the table. They weren't as good as the ones I had in Belgium, but they definitely weren't bad, and there was also plenty to share for two people. The restaurant itself isn't all that fancy but their service is. They make sure you're taken care of throughout the entire meal.   Oh, you must get the Banoffee Pie. What's better than Banana + Toffee + Graham Cracker Crust. Absolutely nothing. It's heaven in your mouth.",

    "text": "This place has been a firm favourite of mine for about 18 months now. It's always been number one when I'm suggesting places to eat out to other people. The food is excellent and I love the location. The menu is fantastic and there's something for everyone.  With this in mind, I booked a table for myself and two friends who were visiting from England last night. Imagine my horror, when almost immediately, our waitress ruined the night. Her attitude was downright unpleasant; she spoke over my friend when taking drinks orders, then snapped at her to ''wait one moment'' before flouncing off with an air of one who has a gigantic chip on their shoulder.  I was more than a tad embarrassed that this is how visitors to our country were being spoken to in a supposed respectable establishment.  We concluded that she must have been having a bad day and, while still unhappy with her lack of professionalism, we were willing to just let it go and get on with enjoying our evening. We had our starters and as always the food was brilliant; but then Ms Attitude was back to clear our table, knocking another waitress away in the process she took away the bread we'd ordered. My friend asked her to bring it back and when she came to our table with it she said ''would you like three plates for your one piece of bread?'' In the most sarcastic and unnecessary tone I've ever heard (and I am the queen of sarcasm). At this point I asked the front of house to change our waitress because she was ruining our night and being downright rude.   Now, we all know that people in the service industry and any kind of customer service face a multitude of awfulness from the general public, which is why decent people will generally tip them when they've done a good job. However, this girl is asking for all the shitstorms the people of Edinburgh could possibly dream up when dining in this place, so much so that I've not even bothered to talk about the food in this review - that's how bad her service was. It completely overshadowed the food, wine and general atmosphere.   So at the end of the meal (after spending a lot of money in there) when we were paying the bill, we asked the front of house waitress if Ms Attitude was always so unpleasant to customers. She told us that this girl had thought my friend was someone who was rude to her in a club once. Bear in mind that my friends have been in Edinburgh a sum total of twice and have never been in any of the clubs in the city. Now if this is to be believed (which is pushing it for me) and she honestly thought my friend was someone who'd been abusive to her previously, why did she not arrange for someone else to wait our table?   I can't express how disappointed I am with how our meal panned out last night. I can say that I won't be back, despite the excellent food, I have no desire to pay to be treated like crap and then lied to about why, ever again.",

In a word, the mussels were terrific! We tried the bacon and cream. Plump mussels, huge pot, delicious.  Our scallop starter was equally good. The steak was fine but next time we are just doing mussels. This is really their thing.  Not five stars as they just opened (second location) and fumbled a bit with forgetfulness and delays.  The staff and owner were very friendly and apologetic. Highly recommended  .",

The inside is modest but nice and aside from the somewhat crabbit (maybe German?) bartender, the service was just fine.  We split a bucket of mussels (shallot cream white wine sauce) and I had an 8oz ribeye - the husband had something weird like pasta.  The mussels were the best I've had in my life, truly amazing, and the steak, skinny little thing that it was, was delicious also.  The quality of the local beef and seafood spoke volumes - no extravagant preparations or sauces required.  Highly recommend.",

The main course of mussels came with at least 30, and they were delicious as well (we had the chili seasoning). Others in our group had steaks that were nicely cooked (medium rare) and tasty--great chips, too. Our waiter was a bit casual with the service, but the other wait staff picked up the slack.  Overall, it was an excellent Edinburgh meal, with ingredients that featured the best that Scotland has to offer.",

    "text": "Came here with family for dinner on a Saturday night. We booked in advance, but the place wasn't terribly busy in the end. The atmosphere is quite formal and a bit quiet, rather than bustling and busy. I went for the red curry mussels, as did my husband - my parents got the traditional with shallots and cream. The servers gave us the wrong mussel pots which took us a while to figure out, as all the sauce collected at the bottom and wasn't really coating the mussels, so we honestly couldn't tell whose was whose initially. We had to take some of the huge portion of mussels out and put them to the side, so we had space to use our spoons to coat the remaining mussels in sauce. Once we managed that though, the mussels were very tasty and fresh. The sauces were mild, but added a nice subtle flavour to the dish. Sides were decent but basic - slightly soggy fries, steamed seasonal vegetables, nothing terribly exciting. The price can't be beat though, at 14 for an enormous meal.  Not the most memorable of meals, but an enjoyable one. I think a loosening up of the atmosphere would go a long way.",

My husband had the mussels both nights with different sauces and said they are the best he has had. I had the vegetarian pasta with mushrooms and truffle sauce - great! Tonight I ordered the seafood platter in a bouillabaisse sauce and it was delicious. A huge scallop, lots of shrimp, tons of muscles. Yum! The place is very busy so you might want to make a reservation.",

    "text": "The best surf and turf I have ever had.   I stumbled upon this place by accident during a day trip to Edinburgh. It was during Scotland's unexpected (and sorely missed) heatwave so we sat outside - a rare treat in our climate. We were the first diners when we sat down but by the time we left the place was full and there was a great vibe.   Now to the food. Me and my dad both opted for the same thing - the surf and turf. This consists of a Rib Eye Steak served with half a kilogram of mussels cooked in your choice of sauce, crevettes and squid rings. Being a big fan of Asian flavours I opted for the chilli, ginger and lime sauce. We also ordered some buttered new potatoes on the side to add some carbohydrate to all the protein.  When the dish arrived it was amazing. Perfectly cooked steak (medium-rare for me) sitting on a mountain of seafood - not many things could look so appealing. All the seafood was full of flavour, the sauce had just enough heat and the Corona with lime just added to an amazing meal.  Next time I'm in Edinburgh I will definitely be making a return here (I hope the heatwave will too).",

Granted, each time i've come here, I've stuck with wine, oysters and mussels - so I haven't strayed too far into the menu but really, I've never needed to. The mussels are delicious (I'm especially fond of the whisky/bacon combo).  The wine list is good. The service is pleasant. The prices are reasonable. The mussels are great.  Voila! Case closed.",

It was a Friday around 730 and we didn't have reservations, but we were able to be seated for a table for two. The manager was cheeky and ribbed my date a little bit for pretending to look in the reservation book to pretend to be someone else, which was very amusing. We were able to sit upstairs and I thought the place had lovely ambience.   We started with some fried goat cheese balls and garlic grilled mussels. Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of mussels but I thought \"When in Rome!\" and tried them. They were really tasty, but I'm not sure garlic was the best date choice! Anyway, for my main I had a special fried plaice with black pudding mash that was extremely tasty. My date had a steak that he enjoyed. Topped off with a nice glass of house white and I was a happy camper. I will definitely come back to The Mussel and Steak for another nice dinner in the future when I'm in the area, which of course I will be because I do love BrewDog...",

My friend had the seafood curry while I had pot of mussels with chips. The mussels were delicious and on par with mussel inn. I can no longer order mussels from cafe rouge as they are not the same ha ha.  It was quite busy as it was lunchtime and lot of tables of four or more people but we weren't squeezed into a corner but a nice table near the front area.   Recommend this place if you are this side of the castle!!!",

    "text": "The short: NOT GOOD FOR KIDS.  TERRIBLE SERVICE.  FOOD IS GOOD, BUT NOT WORTH THE PRICE AND THE TERRIBLE SERVICE.  The long: My family, including my 8 year old son, chose to make a reservation at this restaurant based on the Yelp ratings and the fact that the Yelp reviews said it was Good for Kids.  I wanted to try fresh Scottish seafood being our last night in Edinburgh.  We arrived 20 minutes early for our reservation, and was told \"we're not ready for you\", which I understand.  However, after standing in the rain outside waiting until our reservation time, other walk-ins with no reservations were seated.  Around the time of our res, I told the same woman at the front \"please let us know when our table is ready\" and she looked at me with a quizzical look, and then said \"yes come in\".  When we were seated, my son knocked past our future waitress and she rolled her eyes.  We were seated literally in a back corner of the restaurant.  We were the only people with a kid there, and there were 2 other empty tables near ours (where we could have easily sat 20 minutes earlier).  There is nothing for kids to eat here.  Forget about it.  My son had the mac and cheese, which was made with sharp cheese, so you can imagine how that went.  The seafood stew was good, and the mussels were good.  The steak was thin and barely seasoned.  We could NOT get help from our waitress.  Our meal took an hour and a half mainly because I think we saw our waitress twice.  There were other large parties of adults there that looked like they were having a good time, but we couldn't get any help.  Twice we had to go to the bar to ask for water or bread or another drink.  When we got them, the drinks were quite good.  That's about all the positive I have to say.  With some management coaching, this place could be quite good.  Also, if they don't want kids there (as I was getting the impression), they should come in and correct this Yelp summary.  On a side note, the Barony pub had good pub food with great service.  Go there instead!",

I arrived somewhat early and was promptly seated at the window getting a great view of the outside while I ate. The server was very nice and friendly. I ordered the Cullen skink and a kilo of mussels with white wine cream sauce as well as an additional side of bread. the Cullen skink was like a seafood chowder and it was delicious. Then came the Potter muscles and that was pretty freaking good. That bread though... was out of this world. 2.25? Completely worth it. That bread was crispy on the outside and really soft on the inside and soaked up all that sauce from the mussel pot. The muscles were delicious and it felt like it was never ending. I can't wait to come back again.",

I was thrilled that the seasonal veggies here in August were zucchini, broccolini, and mushrooms - not peas and carrots like everywhere else in the UK!!",

But once you start ordering appetizers or any of the other entrees, it can get pretty pricey pretty fast. I didn't think the mussels were anything out of the ordinary really -- and I was surprised to find cilantro all over mine (usually it's parsley when you order a shallot, butter, and white wine sauce). This wasn't on the menu so I had to try and pick the cilantro out. The one must-order here though I would say is the grilled scallops with butter appetizer. It's juicy, buttery, slightly sweet scallops on the shell -- and probably my favorite thing here.",

Firstly, it does good food- whether you are into seafood or meat. You get to watch your food being cooked on a screen (which is slightly odd) and I love the layout of the ground floor- quite modern without over doing it. Look out for the fun facts about mussels in the toilets.  The service has always been super friendly at this place. Being in such a prime location I was expecting shocking prices but I was pleasantly surprised. They have amazing lunch deals and I have never walked out of this place hungry.  Sadly they only have one vegetarian option as far as mains courses go. Also, in the winter the upstairs floor tends to get really warm.   Aside of these hitches Mussels and Steak Bar is a good standard for me.",

The second, and more disturbing, is the complaint that a restaurant with the name \"Mussel and Steak Bar\" has a fairly short menu. One might have thought, nay expected, that the menu would be mainly ...  On a positive note, what I can say is that they provide first class food. What they say they do they do well. The steaks, in my experience, are meltingly tender. The chips (US: french fries) cooked in beef dripping are crisp and moreish.  The restaurant is good value because not a  morsel will be left on the plates.",

Smoked salmon appetizer, then 16 oz. of rump steak goodness cooked exactly as requested (medium).  The horseradish sauce was a nice touch too.  Again, props to the staff.

Located just across the street from a longer strip of restaurants and pubs in the Grassmarket, it would be possible to pass the Mussels Steak Bar without giving it a second thought. That would be a huge mistake.  I've made about 12 trips here for lunch and dinner, and every time I've always been greeted by an unbelievably friendly waiter or waitress. They start you off with some of the best crusty bread and softest whipped butter you'll ever taste, and they are happy to replenish it many times over.  My favorite way to start a meal is with a kilo pot of their mussels, which are all ridiculously fresh and delicious, particularly with the white wine, shallots, garlic and cream sauce. Both the steaks and the seafood pasta (with loads of mussels, scallops, prawns, and calamari) are excellent main courses, and their fries with 'beef dripping' are some of the best I've ever tasted. Their wine list is not huge but offers good selection at reasonable prices.   The meal can definitely run on the pricey end depending on the conversion rate (if you're an American) but I have never walked out of this place unsatisfied. Highly, highly recommended!",

But it's easy to find mouth-watering seafood everywhere!  Order the surf and turf w/creamy shallot white wine.  The bread pairs nicely with the juice of the mussels and white wine.  The chili, ginger and coriander sauce is tasty, but honestly, it is NOT as delectable as the white wine.  The beef is truly juicy, but make sure you specify if you want it cooked medium, rare, well-done, etc.  The seasoning if fairly simple, but it works!  The staff is friendly, and there's a tv that shows what the chefs are cooking.  I'm not quite sure if it's real-time or if all of it is pre-recorded, but it's kinda neat to see what meals are about to be served.",

Veg have to be ordered separate i.e. on top of the price as far as I remember.  They do a great lunch deal, the portions are smaller but at approx 60% of the evening price well worthy it.

I don't particularly like mussels (the shellfish) nor curry, but I boldly decide to order the Seafood Coconut Curry, which consists of mussels, squid, king scallops, and prawns.  When it arrives, it is 75% mussels, so I'm apprehensive; but it was outstanding!  (Those mussel shells take up a lot of space.)

The mussels are plump and juicy and the broth is perfectly made -- full of flavour but not overwhelming the taste of the mussels. I was sopping it up with bread the whole way through. I tried the steak as well, but it wasn't anything particularly outstanding for me.   Fair warning though, if you're tempted by both the steak and the seafood option, don't go for the surf and turf! The quality of the seafood in the surf and turf is not as good as individual orders of seafood for some reason, so I'd highly suggest just sharing two mains with your dinner partner and getting the best of both worlds.",
