How fancy!)  - Delicious lunch  - Friendly staff  - Tons of cute babies to make funny faces at (Seriously, I challenge you to go to Loudons and NOT see at least one cute baby. It won't happen.).  - (and best of all) Free, FAST,  Wi-Fi.   My best friend and I sit in there all day, drinking coffee and working on our laptops. When we're feeling flush (aka when we're not feeling dirt poor) we splurge for a pesto, mozzarella sandwich or a quiche to split for lunch. The food is really tasty!!  Well done, Loudons.",

    "text": "So I had read so many good reviews on Loudons, I figured it was about time I should go and see for myself!   A few friends and I went there as a location to study for a group project. I enjoyed our spot because it was nice and airy, and the large windows made it pleasant to be sitting there for what ended up for me to be 4 hours!!   The good!  1. The coffee is so delicious. If you're nearby get coffee from here! it's no more expensive than any other cafe.  2. THE SANDWICH! I, myself, am very indecisive. A staff member was so helpful and created the ultimate sandwich for me. I told him to surprise me, and told him how hungry I was. He created the best mixed salami type sandwich! I was so upset when I finished the last bite 3. The staff are always smiling and helpful, moreso than most places. When I went to a table to fill up my waterglass and they noticed my frustration of there having been no water left in the jug, they were on it in a second, without me asking!  4. The cakes!! If you like good bread and cakes you're in a good place. 5. What is normally ignored is side salad. You know the 'salad' that is 3 pieces  of  wilting lettuce and one cherry tomato beside your sandwich? Well here, I don't know how the dressing is so good, but it definitely compliments and doesn't fit into the 'lame' category.  The not as good. 1. If you're around during peak lunchtime it can get a bit busy and loud. As mentioned in a previous review there will most likely be kids around. Even though they are cute, sometimes they cry. Not ideal for studying.   Besides that I have no complaints. I really did enjoy myself. And even after having been hanging about for 4 hours no one gave me any looks implying that I should get a move on.   I'll be going back!!!! I want that sandwich again. Yum.",

    "text": "i've been aware of loudon's for awhile, but as it's rather far from my end of town i've not visited.  also it's hard to want to try a new cake place when i live a ten minute walk from the ultimate cake place in edinburgh!  sadly this cake place was fully booked on saturday, so with some brainstorming together we managed to come up with loudon's for Kelly F's birthday lunch.  i was already a fan as when i phoned up to see if they took a booking (as their yelp page says they don't) i was informed that they do indeed take bookings as long as you have a party over 6.  we were a party of ten, so table booked and no having to hope they had space for us :)  on arrival it was a beautiful sunny day with the light streaming through the floor to ceiling windows at the front of the cafe.  it made the area feel bright and open which was also helped by the high ceilings and good use of space.  there were loads of tables but all within a reasonable distance of the next, so no feeling like you were sat on top of the party next to you.  our party of 10 had a nice long table right in front of the tea counter with loads of space.  we were also right near the cake display table which was at the front of the shop as you entered.  i quite liked that they had all their cakes on display and you also got to serve yourself so could pick the biggest or smallest slice of cake to suit.  they also kept bringing out fresh cakes to replace those that had sold out so it was clear everything had been made on the day.    i was a bit disappointed to see that they were only offering a weekend brunch menu as their sandwiches and pizza sounded really tasty.  but i'm not one to say no to scrambled eggs so i order the scrambled eggs with salmon and toast.  this also came with a tomato salad (which was actually just some cherry tomatoes cut in half...)  i added a apple and cinnamon tea to this.  food arrived quickly which was excellent as i was starving!  it was definitely a decent serving and i found the eggs and smoked salmon to be very nice.  also two huge pieces of toast, a slice of granary bread and a slice of white!  the only thing missing was enough butter for the toast.  i ended my brunch with a cream cheese brownie that was just delightful.  it was a small square so just enough to satisfy my sweet craving but not too much to make me feel overly full.  the brownie was moist and chocolately, definitely one of the better brownies i've had!  the only problem i had with loudon's was it's prices.  i had taken out 20 to cover myself for the entire day, including a few errands i had to run.  after leaving loudons i only had a few pounds left from the original 20 :(  my breakfast was over 10 and add in my brownie and a slice of cake for the birthday girl and i had spent about 16 in total!!  now i think the cakes were a fairish price, they were freshly made and of good quality.  but 8 for some scrambled eggs with salmon and toast...i feel like that was a bit pricey as i can get the same breakfast of the same quality for 2 less at other cake cafes.  also my tea was almost 3, however they did refill my tea pot with hot water when i asked so i guess i really got two servings out of the one pot.  so overall i was a fan, but not a 5 star place as i felt it was a bit pricey for what was being served.  however, if i'm in that side of town i'll happily pop in for a cuppa and some cake maybe making sure i've got more cash on hand first!",

    "text": "On Sunday 14th August my husband and I went for our lunch at 1.45pm. When we tried to order we found there was no eggs benedict , no spinach and no smoked Salmon eg a third of the menu was ' Aff' . Most of the occupied and unoccupied tables were covered in leftover china / food glasses etc. We cleared a table for ourselves and reconsidered our menu options. The cakes were amazingly tasty + nice selection + fortunately that kept us going untill the eggs arrived. We asked if they could do brown bread toast + scrambled egg and ordered drinks. I said brown bread twice. We sat at a wobbly table outside and the scrambled eggs came beside 2 slices of barely toasted cold white bread + no butter. We asked the waitress for butter but it didn't arrive so we ate the very small portion of nicely scrambled eggs then my husband went inside and saw some leftover butter on a table of dirty plates and thought that was probably the best bet as a large group of tourists had arrived at the counter. We were thirsty so went to take a glass + water jug from the table but all the glasses though placed upside down wet on the table next to the nearly empty jugs were very grubby. It looked as if the dishwasher water badly needed changed. It is very unhygienic to have dirty + wet glasses sitting on the table in a warm day so I had to go back up to the cake area and get two paper cups. Another 20 mins later our drinks arrived with chipped cups + no saucer/ spoon for husbands coffee + when I poured my tea a pubic type hair came out the teapot If the tea hadn't been scalding hot I certainly wouldn't have just picked it out + drunk the tea. My husband had to go back inside + search for sugar + spoon as the waitress hadnt brought it with the drink. It had taken so long for the tea to come I couldn't bear to start again. Every time the waitress came our to deliver a drink / plate of food she walked back past multiple tables strewn with lots of dirty dishes/ cups + leftover food that was attracting pigeons. Is it not sensible for her to attempt to pick up even a cup rather than go in empty handed again + again. We like the airy space and idea of what you are trying to create + cakes were fab but general poor hygiene + chaotic service etc let it down. We had a very dissapointing experience and though we go out for brunch every sunday + love your airy place + cakes I dont think the overall experience was up to scratch/ good value.",

While they now do table service, you have to wait to be seated - which just feels out of place for a cafe like this. I used to stop in regularly to pick up a coffee on my way to work - mostly due the fantastic barristas who knew me by name, remembered my order, and made it to perfection. Now I usually walk by, as it just doesn't feel as welcoming anymore.",

Staff where very supportive and helpful all friendly and wearing smiles. Food was excellent, large plates for the value and excellent drinks available, tee's, juice, coffees and other drinks. Meal options were plentiful especially for the gluten free member of the group and the staff were even more helpful in dodging around any possible issues and recommending options. Would recommend to visit this place for anyone in Edinburgh, locals and tourists alike. I will be back when I return to Edinburgh. Thanks Loudons team for a full great experience.",

    "text": "It only takes me almost a week to review after an event!  I'm obviously on top of things.  Joined the Yelpers for brunch here last weekend and had a lovely experience.  Loudons is big and bright, with large tables and just enough decorations to give it character.  In front of the order counter is a huge table piled with cakes and scones.  It's both rude and fantastic because you want a bite of everything!  As it was Sunday brunch the place was packed.  When I went up to order the girl told me it would be about 30 minutes for food to arrive, and as I was already quite hungry I asked if I could quickly add a scone to my order.  She said of course and I picked on up on my way back to my table.  Oh this scone!  So fluffy, so tasty.  It really helped tide me over until the food arrived.  And when it did- eggs benny with gammon, so delicious!  The flavour was unbelievable.  Maybe I need to get out more.  Om nom nom.      I really liked Loudons.  It was the perfect place to catch up with people and chat with new friends.  I can see this place becoming a quick favourite!  And I can't wait to go back and stuff my face with some of those cakes; who am I kidding, all those cakes.",

Amazing homemade cakes on display on a large oak table, which you help yourself to and pay at the counter.  Try the gamon eggs benedict  - heaven!  Food and drink is a little expensive here, I would have given them 5 stars if it was more reasonable.  A glass of OJ costing 3.50!  Hmm... is there vodka in that?!   Anyway, I do like it, the interior is clean, fresh and funky!  Two elevations with floor to ceiling windows makes it great for people watching.  They have a good stock of newspapers available to browse and the staff are friendly.  Good for weekend catch-ups.",

The ordering system was like being in a canteen but with restaurant prices. We were hungry after a great night out in Edinburgh though so we decided to persist. I ordered the Eggs Benedict with Ham, or the \"eggs beni\" as the staff annoyingly insisted on calling it. The amount of food that came out was as small as the abbreviated name. The staff then proceeded to clean up around us as we were still eating, the place wasn't even busy so I don't know why they wanted us out so quickly.

In North America, it seems that many businesses serve gargantuan drink sizes, which are excessive and unhealthy. A flat white is typically served in what I now understand as a perfect portion, though would initially appear as a kid's sized cup. Loudon's serves up a mean flat white, I tell ya! I also helped myself to a slice of lime coconut cake, so delightful. The setting allows the space tons of exposure to light, which makes for an absolutely pleasant visit!",

It was firstly inhabited by the odd local (me) and lots of IT / Techs and then in the last few months has been inhabited by the Yummy Mummies!  Last time I went and I kid you not, there were no less than 17 babies (and respective mums).  I think that's both comforting for parents and a warning for others!  Food is all cooked fresh in site. They make a mean quiche and eggs benedict at the weekend is a must.  Coffee is good old Artisan Roast and tea is Eteaket (I think!).  I must say I prefer the savouries to the cakes, but that is my wee preference!  Now for the teensy niggles which by no means put me off from going.  The staff are lovely and delightful but - not particularly efficient, if you want a clean and clear table you might wait a while (sorry!).  Also, ordering can be confusing when you first arrive as there are two tills, and if one of them if not open, you might stand there for a while thinking you are being ignored!  As I said, this in now way puts me off, I'm sure all of those teensy things will improve over time.  I just wish they were open later in the day! But I think, there may be plans afoot!  SO - recommend highly for lunch/brunch and cofffee - just beware of the babies! :-D",

    "text": "On my birthday this year a group of my friends and I decided to go for lunch and cake to celebrate. The original plan was to go to Mimi's bakehouse as it's my favourite bakery in Edinburgh. Unfortunately I had underestimated just how many friends would want to come along and once we hit 10 people Mimi's could no longer accommodate us all. We now had to try and find somewhere in Edinburgh that sold good cake that could fit 10 of us in at short notice. In steps Loudens (and Robyn Z) to the rescue.   Robyn booked a table for us all at Loudens, who weren't serving lunch but could accommodate us for brunch and cake instead. Fair doos. I like bacon. When we walked in we were greeted by a table stacked with cake, there was actually a bit of a struggle for space going on. That is just the kind of sight you want to be greeted by on your birthday. The inside has a bit of an industrial feel but is very light and airy and surprisingly warm for such a bit space. There were also a lot of families in enjoying weekend brunch too which I liked as it made the place seem even chattier and busier than it actually was. (Though the place was really busy anyway.)     There was a particularly tasting looking special on offer of thyme creamy mushrooms on toast that sounded yummy so I plumped for that with some scrambled egg as an extra. Unfortunately only a couple of minutes after I sat down our server came over to tell me that they had run out of mushrooms and that I would have to order something else. Bless Jenny L for wailing 'but it's her birthday' from beside me. I felt a bit sorry for the poor woman but I was disappointed when I said I would just have bacon or something instead. Imagine my surprise around 15 minutes later when our server placed a plate with pretty much everything they serve for brunch (including mushrooms) stacked up on it. They had run out to the Tesco across the road to buy mushrooms for me and just stacked everything on the plate anyway cos birthdays. I was so touched that they had done that. I couldn't believe that they had gone to so much effort just to give me mushrooms, I felt a bit mortified, but also a bit special at the same time.   The food and tea was delicious as was the carrot cake I got for after. (I had to have this boxed up to take away as after such a massive portion of EVERYTHING for brunch I was just way to full to finish it. Ironic really as I came predominately for the cake. I went downstairs to use the toilet and spent some time admiring the cake baking going on in their special kitchen down there. (All their cakes are baked on site in the cafe.)   My one fault of the place would be the price. I thought it was a little expensive for brunch and felt kind of guilty for essentially forcing all my friends to come to such a costly place just for me. It's nice for a treat but there is no way I could afford to come here for brunch all the time.",

    "text": "Loudons is a good-sized bakery and coffee shop tucked into the back of the ongoing re-development at the Fountainbridge and Morrison Street area. The part of town in which it's located is lacking a bit in atmosphere, but the place itself is spacious, airy and modern inside.  I've been here a couple of times now for hot drinks and (obviously) cake. There is a good selection available that you plate up yourself and then pay for along with your drink. Last time I visited I had a nice slice of ginger cake with a massive latte (too much coffee for me!) and previous to that a doorstop of chocolate cake with some breakfast tea. Both times the cake and drink were grand.   I can't put my finger on it, but there's something stopping me from adding the fifth star on here. I wonder if it's maybe because I feel that Loudons trying a bit too hard; the decor and layout all feels quite contrived and not very natural, even though it's very nice.  It's all a bit yummy mummy, freelance web developer, super cool Guardian reader-esque. Loudons have cleverly carved out a wee niche and have nestled very nicely into it, but I get the feeling it's all just a bit too considered.   Still, a good place to pop in for a coffee and a chinwag. Recommended!",

You also have to gather your own jam etc. I hate gathering my own jam.  The coffee takes too long to come and when it does, it is far from hot enough.  That's my summary.

You can tell it's a spin off from Peter's Yard - the decor and general atmosphere is very similar. You are much more likely to get a seat though!   The food is excellent as is the coffee. The food is a little on the expensive side, but I feel that the quality and generous portions means it still represents good value.   My one quibble would be that the menu system isn't very clear. Sometimes what's on the counter doesn't seem to match the menu, and that doesn't match what the people next to me have ordered.   Definitely my first choice for coffee and food in Fountainbridge.",

    "text": "Sad to say this place has dropped ... Went here a few times last year and really enjoyed it! Tasty food and great deserts!  Really the deserts are what make this place stand out because there are gluten free and dairy free options and their all tasty.   And while the desserts are still good the place has gone down ... They now seat you , instead of the more informal cafe feel it had before... Which could seem good but their table service isn't very good and takes forever!  I had an 40 for lunch and was only getting a latte when I met my husband there on a thur. Between being seated, order taken and then us reminding them, it took the whole time. When they finally brought me my latte after 30 min it wasn't even soya !! My husbands lunch still hadn't  show up either. I had to leave and the serve rushed to make me a latte and told him it was too late he gave it to me for free and somehow it only took 3 min! Crazy :/  I left my husband and he had to remind the server again of his order which also seemed to have been forgotten... He waited 45 min from order time for his meal, Which they gave him for free as well... I feel like it was nice they gave the meal for free but really if they hadn't that would have dropped them to one star...  Such a shame they changed to table service I think the countered service worked better for them.  I double I'll be back , even if their cakes are delicious it's not worth the hassle.",

    "text": "Just came back from Loudons. Cake, cake and oh.. look.. some more cake. They are all lovely. The look great and smell wonderful. I choose a banana & date gluten free piece with a kumquat. Very nice. The ordering is done by queueing up and supply your order to the cashier. State your table by waving in the general direction and they will bring it out to you.  I ordered the Special - omelet with creamy leek and mushroom, fresh OJ and green tea - Anita ordered Eggs Benny, OJ and cappuccino. The lady advised that as it is busy it may take up to 20 min. That was understandable.   We sat on our table and poured ourselves some water and wait,   It was time too take in the surroundings. Apart from the massive display of cakes on a central table, the whole environment would not look out of place in IKEA - there I said it. This place remind me of a IKEA shopping pit stop canteen. Clean, practical, uniform and designed. Book cases as dividers, coffee tables in clean birch veneer. Stainless steel worktops, simple and practical ornaments.   The place was packed. Thus the wait and the queues. The ordered foods and drinks came in scattered delivery. They were trying hard and it showed but many a time they were unable to identify which table ordered what. First the OJ, then a little later my Green Tea. - No cappuccino, but seeing the business it was to be expected a little later we guess.  Our brunches arrived and it was nice eating, but could've used more seasoning. But there was Black Pepper and Pink Himalayan Salt grinders on the table so no biggy. During the meal we enquired about the cappuccino - \"on its way!\" cool.   With regards to the drinks - The OJ was fresh and very good! My Green Tea however did not contain enough leaves to even colour, let alone flavour the water..   It didn't get any easier for the staff as the queues were getting longer.  Anita's cappuccino hadn't arrived still after we finished our brunch, a quick wave and new request ensured that this was finally delivered.   I think this place is good, the food is nice. They are possibly a victim of their own success. Waiting times and service execution is affected by that and the staff looked harassed and stressed. Shame as you can tell they were trying to keep on top of it. Maybe on a quieter day this is much better.. but now.. nah, can't give it anymore than 3 stars.",

Love the friendly service and the awesome food. The chef here is great at whipping up soups and specials, with everyhting cooked fresh in the cafe each day. Follow them on Twitter and Facebook and you get heads up on the specials and treats they have each day. They are flexible too so if you have a special dietary needs, they can alter things or make something special for you.  As well as the food and drinks, the other thing I love about Loudons is the atmosphere. It is a big spacious place with loads of light, and they have a policy of playing no music. I love this (so unusual) so you can have real conversations with friends wihtout shouting, sit and read or work on your laptop (there's free wifi too).   I rarely go a week now without popping in.",

    "text": "We happened upon this place because we were in the area and I found it to the most reviewed on Yelp! Walking in, I felt like it was very similar to the type of thing you would see in the States, (i.e. Paradise Bakery or Panera), it isn't super clear how to order, and it takes a minute to figure out how it works, but in all, it is very similar to other places about town offering soup and sandwiches. The pastries looked amazing and it is a lovely space, all be it, a bit too massive. The windows are great, but it feels a bit like a cafeteria maybe. The staff was very friendly and our food came out promptly. I am surprised they don't give you table numbers, seeing it is such a large cafe, but they had no trouble finding it.   The food was very good, however, a bit pricy, they were very large portions for lunch size. For 8.95, you can do a half sandwich and soup or a quiche and soup. We opted for one of each, I got the brie and aubergine quiche and the roasted pepper and cabbage soup and my boyfriend had the salmon sandwich and a chicken and lentil soup. The quiche was delicious, lots of brie and a great sized slice. The soup was equally as lovely, my only gripe is that parsley is not a great garnish, but that's just me. The half sandwich was definitely a whole sandwich in my opinion and the bread was amazingly soft and grain-filled. We really enjoyed splashing out for lunch, but my recommendation would be to lower the price and the portion sizes.   It's not somewhere I would go regularly for lunch as without drinks our meals were 18 together. I have found the same sort of meal to be about 12-13 pounds elsewhere. Although, great quality so I can't complain other then be a sort of budget eater. It also has a mixed lunch crowd, including business to babies. So be warned.  If you go downstairs to use the loo you can see into the bakery, and it just smells wonderfully of butter. I would say, a lovely place to grab a bit, but it doesn't feel very local, if that makes sense. Maybe the size of it, makes me feel it isn't a very warm place to have lunch regularly. Although the 1 filter coffee, reminded me of America and good on them for offering it.   Definitely a very business area-type eatery, with delicious food, although slightly out of my price range to be a regular. Although, the sweet and treats looked heavenly. Maybe I will return for a delicious treat some day.",

Light, spacious and glass-fronted, with stand-alone bookshelves, tallboy tables, free Wifi and sofas in the corner, Loudons was perhaps a little too comfortable for a museum cafe, but surely the lost treasures of ancient Babylon were in another building just around the corner somewhere, for what else would cause a beautiful place such as this to charge an eye-watering 6.45 for a pot of rooibos tea and a slice of cheesecake? Cheesecake, I might add, which I had to plate up for myself.  But at Loudons, you pay for the experience. You pay for the space, the light, the ample seating. You pay for the large range of choice in cakes and yummery. You pay for the gloriously cheerful staff, who will take time out of their busy day to discuss the still-expanding Knitted Thing draped amply across your industrious companion's lap and pooling in lichen-like waves on the floor. You pay for the cheesecake so dense and flavoursome that a single slice fills you like a meal, and for those natty little strainer-teapots that hardly drip at all (why are these not compulsory in all tea situations? Why?). You pay for the joy of being able to find cafe with real personality even when you're not in the dead centre of town. You pay for somewhere that won't chivvy you along, even if all you want to do is sit and write a very long letter over a pot of tea at 2 o'clock on a Saturday afternoon.  I'd go back, and I'd pay again.",

A friend brought me here for breakfast, which was a very small selection of extremely unexciting options: rolls, granola, and eggs with bacon. After a pause to turn the page over, hoping for more, I settled on the eggs and bacon.   The surprise came when the owner's son/waiter told me they had gf bread. And the biggest surprise came when that bread turned out to be the most amazing, crisp, fulfilling gf breads I've had the delight to devour. Though you may argue that the amount of butter I put on my bread would surely make it agreeable no matter what, I assure you, I put that much butter on all the time and I could still tell that this was the best. I told my smiley waiter to pass on my compliments to his german baker (he gave me those details, I didn't know they by osmosis, or from a peculiar grain in the bread that only comes from germany and only german bakers are allowed to use it).   I didn't have coffee here, having already had an espresso, but my friend told me his was great.   The space is very open, lots of floor-to-ceiling windows, with some couches to relax on. They DO NOT have wifi, probably to keep turning people over, as it is crazy busy.   Also- their display of cakes and scones was beautiful, and though being gf I couldn't eat any, there was a general flutter around the dessert table the whole time we were there, so they must be scrumptions.",

The combination of crunchy outside and soft inside - covered in a light but sweet maple syrup - made for a perfect bulwark against the cold wind blowing through Edinburgh.

Alas, I had to leave and step outside and the staff offered a hearty thanks & goodbye. The service was top notch - friendly, helpful, but not annoying while I was dutifully catching up on email. If you've got a bigger group - prepare to wait a bit as it was really busy around noon on a Sunday. It's well worth the wait - great food, friendly service, and a satisfied feeling of comfort that only a great plate of French toast can bring!",

Although they only had one by the time we got there. We had a delicious lunch including quiche, tomato bisque and a hamburger on gluten-free bread. We also tried the gluten-free chocolate cake, which was delicious. All three of those lunches were delicious. The service was a little slow, but they were very busy. The prices are reasonable, and there was no wait time.",

    "text": "I was hit with a breath of fresh air when I opened the door and walked into Loudons; appreciating the openess and light decor with a feeling of being in someone's rather large extended kitchen. As soon as I clocked those cakes sitting pretty on a table waiting for customers to serve themselves a slice, one eye was on the banter of my large table of companions and one remained on those cakes. It was the most magnificant cake display I have seen in a cafe/bakery.  I expected to see more savoury options on the menu as I had been up bright and early on my Saturday morning so had already had breakfast and my mind was now on lunch given it was 2pm when we ordered, however it was a brunch menu available until 3pm. I opted for eggs benedict which was beautiful to look at and delicious to eat.  I think I circled the cake table several times before selecting one, examining every detail as I would a car when wanting to buy one. It was good to see when they had ran out of a cake, another one of the same was brought out to replace it even in mid afternoon. I chose a baked cheesecake with cherries and kiwi fruit on top. For being a huge slice it was light and unexpectedly  floury in texture but it lacked that cheese flavour of a cheesecake but it was nice and I wasn't left feeling too full or sickly.  Loudons attracts a range of customers from young families to couples, groups and singles enjoying a read of the newspapers available or tapping away on their laptops but still offers a peaceful space to enjoy a coffee and cake.   I look forward to my next cake!",

Some Yelpers pointed me in the direction of Loudons (shoutout to Jenny L!) so that's where I went to plan the rest of my day after a stop at the Farmers' Market.  The space is lovely. It's very open, giant windows, decorated in a manner that could be called Scandinavian modern (or 'fancy Ikea') which makes for clean lines and a spacious feel. There are smaller tables for parties of two or four, bigger tables that can be shared by smaller parties and cushy couches. There is, as I've mentioned, free wifi and the staff seem content to let you loaf while you surf.   I'm not one for sweets, but they do have delicious-looking truffles and decadent chocolate cake. There's an open kitchen where the cooks whip up tasty sandwiches and a coffee bar where the baristas pull together espresso drinks and loose-leaf teas, which will be served to your table. I nursed a pot of rooibos for a good hour and it magically managed to stay warm and not over-steep. The next time I went back, I brought the boy and we shared a big bowl of French onion soup, served with crusty baguette, and a slice of walnut coffee cake. They were both superb. Can't wait to be back and try one of their delectable-looking sandwiches.",

The eggs benedict used to be made with this delicious piece if ham now you can choose from dry over-cooked pulled pork, salmon or bacon. Why they got rid of the ham I will never understand.  I am also very annoyed with this new table service. I was told to sit down and I could see a waitress walking around but she kept forgetting about me so I went up to the cashier and ordered. I sat back down and was expecting my drink to arrive yet, no drink. Got back up after 10 minutes and went straight to the barista. All in all very annoying, waiting around to see if I would be noticed. The waitress came over to me 0 times.  What a disappointing experience. Also in my last experience my eggs benedict were dry. I would have let someone know if anyone bothered to come and ask. I'm only giving them 2 stars because I'm hopeful that next time it'll be better.",

Mind you, they're cakes are still some of the best around.   Sometime in the last year they switched from picking out your food and ordering at the till to, now, waiting on a server to take you to a table. I'm not sure exactly how, but this has effected the dynamics of the cafe's atmosphere in a profound way. On my last visit the place was nowhere near full, where in the past I often had trouble finding a table.   I have been here twice in the past month and have had long waits for my food and drinks. In fact, the most recent one took about 20 minutes for our drinks (while getting one of the orders wrong) and 40 minutes (give or take) for my food. The impression I was left with was that the waiter  had forgotten to put our orders in on both counts. I had to remind him to bring our drinks after the first long wait. Then 20 minutes later I had to remind him of my food order to his seeming dismay that I had yet to receive it.   From now on, if I actually call by again for convenience, I'll just be here to get some of their yummy food to take away.   Loudons, you really need to get it together. You once were one of my favourites.",

My conclusion: Not sucha happy camper.  Its not like they were skimping on the coffee or that I should've ordered a more caffeinated drink..but a latte macchiato with no actual coffee! Coffee speak interpretation denied.  Clean, spacious, mindful service.  From other reviews, their actual coffees sound promising.

    "text": "This was my first time at Loudons and I was very excited to try the vegan (and glutenfree) pancakes from their breakfast menu. In fact,  I am not in Edinburgh often and had made a special trip for these pancakes!  My friend was very impressed by them,  I feel a little bit picky in that I would have liked them if they were a bit thicker and fluffier. However,  I suspect that making them vegan AND gluten free allows them to have a regular breakfast item which is suitable for box-ticking a whole host of dietary requirements,  which I think is fantastic. Also, I get far far more excited at this option than what is the usual vegan-friendly breakfast option (if there is one!) of museli or porridge.   For 6.95 you got three small pancakes topped with banana,  strawberry,  and maple syrup. On informing the waitress we were vegan she also told us they had vegan chocolate cake available,  too. I love when wait staff can give me one or two other recommendations without me having to ask.   My friend asked for a veggie sausage on the side of her pancake,  which was added for an extra 1. I also had an iced coffee with soy milk. The place has a nice, bright open interior and we had a great spot in the sun at a window table.   I had a skim through the rest of the menu and they have a salad and a veggie burger and veggie breakfast which I presume could easy be veganised,  if not already vegan,  but there isn't any dietary info on the menu. My one little slight on the experience was when I went to pay the bill and they had charged me for a jug of extra maple syrup,  which had been given to me but I definitely had not asked for it and thought it was just an accompaniment to the dish. But when I queried it the waitress quickly amended the bill and it was all fine.",

Loudons is tucked away in Fountainbridge (opposite the disused Bingo Hall, yet to be a Wetherspoons), and it wasn't really til I ended up there that I realised it was a place that you either had to be in the area for, or really wanted to go to. Lucky me, I was a little bit of both.   It was pretty busy - and as other reviewers have commented, popular with young families for meeting and a-greeting.   I was in for a post-interview cup of tea to ease my drouth, and felt it was necessary to also sample some of their goods (so I could write a half decent review of course). It took a little while to get seated, as it was a busy Thursday lunchtime, to the point where I felt I could have just grabbed a cake from the cake table in front of me and made a run for it and no-one would have noticed. I would note, paying was also a little slow as well and difficult to get anyone's attention when everyone's backs are turned.   Eventually service came and I headed to my table, where I tucked into an apple and cinammon tea (what works better in winter than fruit and spice?) and their vegetable soup of the day, which was a cheeky sweet potato, chilli and lime. The lime, versus a more traditional coconut, was a fab change from the norm for me with chunks of lime rind peppering a very nippy soup. Served with homemade bread, which had the chewiness of homemade bread (unlike other restaurants, half baked baguettes chucked in the oven doth not make it homemade) but happily none of the heaviness of my own halfassed attempts.   It looked like you could just help yourself to cake, but as I was out again in the evening, decided to forgo. It was a touch decision, the cakes did look good, but I had to be semi-good to my ever increasing waistline.   Loudons, I'll be back again, when I work in the area, so take this not as a goodbye for now, but a I'll see you soon. With cake.",

    "text": "I first visited Loudons back in the Summer & recently came again last week based upon that 1st visit here being really positive. When we first stumbled upon this place & it was a sight for sore, tired, hungry eyes (can eyes get hungry?? According to Eric Carmen they can!). We'd been searching for a place to eat breakfast/brunch for what seemed like AGES & when I spotted Loudons it was like an Oasis in the desert of Fountainbridge, by that I mean it was a total DELIGHT, not an Indie lad band from Manchester.  If I had to compare Loudons to a furniture shop (as you do) I would say it's like an alternative IKEA ~ lots of pale woods (oak/pine), funky furniture, a bright, spacious, airy yet still homely feel and nice cakes. No hotdogs though. As well as being a cafe they also have an artisan bakery on site & you can buy the doughy wares here alongside other foods, drinks, teapots and sock monkeys, yep, sock monkeys!   Having only been here twice and both times for Brunch I can only comment on the Brunch menu and what a mighty fine Brunch/Breakfast menu it is! I've had both the Eggs 'how-you-like-them' with Toasted, Handmade Bread (very good) and the Eggs Benedict with Avocado & Bacon (very good also). Glasgow's own Elizabeth F had their French Toast with Maple Syrup & Bacon & the lovely Edinburgh Yelper Caz H had the American Style Pancakes with Maple Syrup, Bacon & Banana ~ both looked amazingly good! The coffee here is also really nice ~ it's provided by the Artisan Roast dudes & prepared lovingly by the lovely Loudons baristas. The 1st time I came I ordered a soya Flat White twice and both came with cute little faces in them! :-) Such a sweet touch. Last time I had as well as a soya FW a soya Mocha too which was really tasty; a good strong, Mocha with just the right amount of chocolate. Delicious.  The cakes here are all handmade on site & vary every day/week. I had one on my first visit & it was really nice; moist & flavoursome. Didn't get an opportunity last time but some cakes I noted were a really tasty looking Carrot Cake, a Gluten Free Almond & Orange cake, some super schexy looking Brownies, some vegan/diary-free cakes and loooaaads more....I should've made notes!   Staff here are super friendly and service is fairly swift without feeling rushed. They also have free Wi-Fi and a lot of their food/drinks here can be bought to Take Away also. They apparently have a loyalty card here also which if I lived closer I would definitely partake in.   When I'm ever in need of a super fly Brunch/Breakfast or just a decent coffee & cake when I'm in Edinburgh I will make sure I visit Loudons again. BOOYAKA!",

    "text": "Great cafe for breakfast or lunch. Ambiance: The ideal cafe - plenty of space with traditional tables and a few comfy sofas as well. Clean and airy. Newspapers and books available to read on site. Service: Very friendly and quick to come over without hovering around. The food won't come much quicker than 15 minutes after your order, but it is freshly made from scratch to it's understandable. Anyway, it's a great place to relax and enjoy your meal without being rushed. Food: I went here twice - for breakfast and lunch. Breakfast consisted of a nice coffee along with the salmon eggs Benedict. It was cooked to perfection and really fresh. Lunch was the steak sandwich on ciabatta. Again,, very fresh ingredients and a good balance of flavours. My only problem with this place is it needs a little more selection for sandwich options. Price: Good value. I's be more than happy to go back here again.",

No qualms about that!  3 stars for being apparently forgotten by the staff a wee bit--hey, it was a busy day for them, so I can understand. But damned if it didn't take us at least 10-15 minutes to manage to even catch someone's eye for the ticket. As an American that's something I've had to get used to over here, but even this was more than the norm.  Still, a lovely place for meeting friends over coffee or tea.",

I like it, it's light, bright and airy and you don't feel too close to the neighbouring tables. They have a nice selection of loose leaf tea, served in a teapot which is always a winner for me.  However, there isn't much atmosphere, the tables and chairs don't encourage you to stay for long - unless you've managed to grab a sofa, and even then, that's a rarity as they're often filled with clambering toddlers!  The selection of cakes has vastly reduced, gone are the large tables as you go in, struggling under the weight of all the cakes. Now there's a reasonable selection at the till, but nowhere near as many as there used to be.   For the area, it's a nice cafe and I'm glad it's still there, but I think I'd be inclined to walk a bit further and find something a little more cozy.",

Large windows to people watch and gaze at the rain, very friendly service & a  huge menu to satisfy vegans, vegetarians and omnis. My only critique - ** and the menu does warn you if you pay attention**- everything is served at room temperature! So if you want hot coffee or cappuccino, then you have to request it.  I ordered a soy cappuccino, a Florentine benedict with mango Chili salsa and Scottish porridge with strawberry puree.  The cappuccino was strong. Thankfully i did notice the warning, so i did request extra hot.   The eggs benedict was cooked perfectly. The chili mango salsa was odd but tastey. The Scottish porridge was really oatmeal and the portion was HUGE. I thought it would be a small side but it is like 2 cups worth of oatmeal. Delicious though I wish the meals were hot. I thought room temperature would be find for food but I would have preferred hot food too.",

The have a full breakfast menu, including a variety of Bennies, which seems to be their specialty. I don't do haggis or black pudding, but it you're more adventurous, those are Benny options. I had a bacon and avocado Benny which was excellent. I also ordered a side of wedges, which were a bit bland and not crispy enough. From what I saw of other people orders, I would stick to the Bennies.",

    "text": "Made an entrance here on Saturday with a friend and her super smiley one year old. Staff were friendly and attentive: quick to reassure the queue (for a table) was moving, & to whisk friend's pram out the way. We shared mixed sushi (so yummy), delicious vegan gingery pancakes and the best scone - spelt - I've ever tasted.  It's a large, bright space with an on-view kitchen so for people who like to be seen and interact with fellow diners it's fab. There are also some quieter high tables near the entrance which folk were using for solo reading or using laptops.  Food quality was superb albeit a bit on the pricey side if you're just looking for a quick breakfast or small lunch. It's more a place for a slow, sociable brunch.",
