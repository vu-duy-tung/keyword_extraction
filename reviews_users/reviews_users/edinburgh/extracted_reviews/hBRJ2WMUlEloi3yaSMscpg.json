    "text": "I remember dining at a Prezzo the last time I was in the U.K. (in London) and enjoying my meal very much. So I was looking forward to trying it again, but this time in Edinburgh.   Our party of 5 were seated in a comfortable booth and we all ordered various entrees. I ordered the Vesuvio pizza (classic thin crust w/ pepperoni & chilis) and for the little one, fried mozzarella and spaghetti w/ meatballs. The pizza was DELICIOUS. Great crust that was thin but still had chew to it, spicy pepperoni and a smattering of sliced red chilis on top. A drizzle of their chili oil over it made this a GREAT spicy pizza. (It was even better cold the following morning!)   My son's fried mozzarella came with a marinara dipping sauce and this was a great tasting appetizer for a child (or adult). The spaghetti w/ meatballs was very tasty, too. My husband had the Tropicalia pizza (which was basically a Hawaiian pizza w/ mushrooms) and while it was good, I personally thought that mine was better. The others in our group seemed to enjoy their entrees (spaghetti bolognese & salmon penne).   Service was efficient and friendly. I'm surprised at some of the negative reviews, as our meal was quite lovely. Prices range from 10-30 quid for an entree.",

    "text": "We've been to this Prezzo a few times and while there's no denying that it's a chain restaurant along the same lines as Pizza Express, Zizzis etc. there are a couple of highlights which keep us coming back for more.  The food is fairly standard, with a good selection of pizza and pasta dishes, and a nice specials menus to keep things interesting. There's also the reliability that comes from a big chain; we've never had a bad meal here.  The location is the real bonus; grab a seat by the side window if you can and you'll be rewarded with great views of North Bridge and Carlton Hill.  A couple of comments mentioned slow service but we've never had a problem. In fact on our last visit we watched one waitress deal with an incredibly difficult customer with the grace of a saint, but there does seem to be quite high staff turnover which could explain the difference in experiences.  Overall, I don't think Prezzo is ever going to blow someone away but it's a solid pick, with decent food at reasonable prices.",

    "text": "The one star is purely as a result of giving a life-long vegetarian ham in my calzone!  I have been here before and it was nice, but Friday changed all that for me and how the manager handled it wasn't great either.   The waiter was nice and I had asked for a veggie calzone and to ensure no Parmesan or Gran Padano cheese as they weren't veggie and the request was all fine until I was cutting through my calzone and found it to be stuffed with ham (as well as all the veggie options I requested)  I tried not to make a scene as we were out with company but inside I was fuming. The manager apologised and said that we wouldn't have to pay for the calzone (stating the obvious) but other than taking a couple of garlic breads off the bill and offering me a free pudding they didn't sort it or explain how this happened. I said no to pudding as I just wanted to leave.   Poor effort prezzo!",

Overall, we said: \"Prezzo was fine. Their pizzas were pretty good, but the overall impression I will leave with is that they understaff their restaurants. Our waitress was lovely, but she was fighting a losing battle to effectively manage things. So the verdict is, Prezzo is a safe but unimaginative choice. I'd recommend you go elsewhere for your Italian treats; there are many better places for you to sample.\"",

Overlooking the Balmoral Hotel and down SOuth Bridge over to Calton Hill, the atmosphere was lovely!  I know this is a chain restaurant but it has far surpassed, in my opinion, the likes of Zizzi's and Pizza Express. They will always have a place in my heart but Prezzo now does too.  Staff were a little on the nervous side but I think possibly were new. However food was delivered promptly and was most delicious.  We went for the Frascati white wine whcich was crisp and dry and complimented the italian food well.   We went for a selection of breads with oils to start with - more than enough for two people, whilst our other two companions had mozzarello 'bites' with tomato salsa.  I went for Chicken Medina, a pasta-type bake with chillies, pepporoni, chicken and tomatoes - delicious comfort food! :)  My friend had the Chocolate gateaux which was very moist and delicious! The sticky toffee pudding was also lovely.  Definitely a nice place to go with friends and family. At weekends they don't book tables but have a look on their website for any deals they might have.  Worth a visit!",

    "text": "Well......... where to start with Prezzo. After having been to the one on St Vincent Street in Glasgow I decided I would take my 'quite fussy' chum here, on the basis that she likes pasta and pizza and doesn't eat much meat.   I really don't think this visit was ever going to live up to the one I had in Glasgow, firstly the building it is in here is far less grandiose and doesn't look like anything special.... at all.  Then there was the service, the girl was perfectly pleasant, smiling and welcoming. BUT I think we must have waited about 10 minutes before they came over asking for our order...... we hadn't even been asked up until this point if we would like drinks, which we certainly did. Then after ordering there was a dreadful wait for these much desired drinks to arrive, which was rather infuriating.  On to the food, it was good. It is nothing spectacular and for the price I think it is a good deal for a quick and tasty meal, but it is nothing I couldn't make at home. My friend decided to be healthy and have a 'light option' of flatbread pizza with salad. I was surprised at the size, it was really rather small considering I had a whole pizza for the same price, and she was rather disappointed with the unadventurous small salad.   Then came the waiting..... again. This time to pay. We had to call someone over after waiting with the card on the table for 10 or 15 minutes. Then not only had we been waiting, but as the staff seem a little discombobulated a young girl came over expecting us to pay AGAIN.  So.... the overall verdict. Food is tasty, much what I expected. Service left a lot to be desired, especially having worked as a waitress myself they just are not quite on the ball.",

The waitress spilled a whole glass of beer over the table next to us. Our food arrived before the drinks & the waitress tried to take it back to the kitchen so she wouldn't get in trouble from her manager! Finally  their card macjine wasn't working & kept declining my card despite me being able to take cash out of the machine. She said it just didn't like visa! So it left the red faced scramble for just enough cash. Wouldn't recommend all in all. Go next door to pizza express",
