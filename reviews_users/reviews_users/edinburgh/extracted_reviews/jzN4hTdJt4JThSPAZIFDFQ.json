We didn't make a reservation (which you should because they are so busy on sundays- will know for next time) & they squeezed us in! I had the vegetarian Sunday roast which was so amazing and so yummy! Nice to be able to have that option when most restaurants don't!",

    "text": "We arrived approx 9pm FRI 4/26 & a very nice hostess/bartender told us there would be a wait for food due to kitchen being overwhelmed but if we would like to sit and have a drink in either dining room or bar til then it would be ok. We chose dining room. As she escorted us to the table she stopped to notify the server of our plan to wait & have a drink. The (male) server replied loudly enough for us to clearly hear that he won't even talk to us until he's ready. He didn't make eye contact or speak to us until the time frame the waitress mentioned was up, despite the fact that at this late dinner hour, the other 5 or so tables had already finished dinner. Only coffees & desserts were ordered by other tables while we waited. We could also see the kitchen staff from our seats and there were no food tickets while we waited. Even then, this rude server waited til a few of them left and served the check to others. When he finally took our order, he didn't bother apologizing and was quite inpatient and inhospitable the rest of our time. We even had to ask for the right cutlery for our dishes.   The two stars is because the gin & tonic's are delicious.",

So salty, in fact, that my friends and I had to do a makeshift solution and ask for a cup of hot water to rinse some of the food in to get rid of some salt lol. We originally wanted to try their Sunday pot roast, but they were out at 8:30pm, so we tried their roasted veggies, ribeye, onion soup, lamb roast and halloumi salad. To be honest, everything was really heavy, but the halloumi salad was unexpectedly so, since they salted and deep fried the halloumi, and we ended up eating most of the other veggies on the plate. Overall, the food was okay. Maybe the pot roast would have been better?",

Nice, looking like freshly cooked dishes, which you probably wouldn't find the same somewhere else - that kind of restaurant I like :] where you can choose from something traditional, but with the restaurants twist on it.   The only thing - the bathroom area could be bit better and go in the mood with the rest of the place.  Great friendly and chilling atmosphere, not too noisy, great service and even if you have a pet, you can take them with you :)",

    "text": "This is a quiet bar at the bottom of Broughton Street that has gone through a few different rebrands over the past few years. Its latest resurrection is as The Ox and whilst it has had a bit of a refit it has retained two levels with the bar on the lowest level and a small mezzanine level which could seat about 30 people if you were booking it as a private area.  The range of drinks isn't extensive, it definitely couldn't be classed as a craft beer bar but it does have some ok beers from smaller brewers. It has about 16 malts on offer and a small range of wine as well as the usual spirits you would expect in any bar. There is some small snacks available to buy although I didn't try them this time.  I'd say this was an ok bar, nothing special but also nothing that would cause me to tell you not to go.",

    "text": "Just stopped here for a quick drink. The Ox was very quiet, my two companions and myself being the only people in it! Was a mid week visit but it was also lunchtime so we were surprised at its emptiness. Unfortunately this meant a lacking atmosphere. We just put this down to it being an extremely sunny June day, hence a lot of people had possibly decided to head for places with outdoor seating on the other side of the street where the sun hit with full force. The Ox unfortunately was in shade. We tried the house Pinot Grigio (very dry) and Sauvignon Blanc (deliciously floral). It's a nice, clean bar which looks recently decorated and I would return to it, possibly at evening time when there may be more customers. Found the barman friendly and helpful and he advised me well as to the characteristics of the wines before I purchased them.",

Staff and the setting are good and although a bit pricier than average in the area for food, the food is good. We had two courses for a Sunday lunch/dinner but actually there are a lot of appealing light bites. Good for a Sunday afternoon roast.",

I have dined here twice now and both times been impressed with the quality of food and excellent service. Their menu is seasonal, fresh and uses local Scottish produce, they have daily specials and on Sundays a traditional roast rib of beef with all the trimmings.....nom nom nom....:) You can pre book the roast when you book a table and this is a good idea as it tends to sell out quickly. The bar is welcoming and hosts and excellent selection of everything you could possibly want and have really lovely staff who went out their way to buy grapefruit at the local shop for my new favourite gin Monkey 47. It's a yes from me.",

    "text": "Really want this place to be better.  Stopped by for dinner the other night as we were yet to experience their menu and the bar experience was no more than average.  Unfortunately the restaurant element is pretty much the same.  First point I would make is why oh why would anywhere offer a sample manu on their website? I had a look and got all excited over the prospect of confit duck only to find the actual menu swarming with seafood. Very disappointing and a blow to my expectations. Putting up a sample menu online is asking for trouble - just get the real thing up there.  After that initial disappointment I wasn't enamored by any of the alternatives on the 'actual' menu so opted for steak - standard - while the missus went for a combination of starters in the white bait and meat board.  The steak came served with some impressive chips, however the meat itself was slightly beyond the requested medium rare and a little tougher than preferred as a result. The peppercorn sauce that came as an addition (1.50 extra) was okay in flavour but seemed a little expensive given its watery consistency. Not a sauce that would have looked good drizzled over a slab of meat.  The whitebait was pretty bland until seasoned by ourselves. The meat board seemed okay (not my thing) but included a weird addition in a wee blob of butter, which you don't tend to see on a meat board.  So all in all a little hum drum and the service continued the theme. Our waitress was not overly attentive and took a questionably long time to return with the card machine following the delivery of our bill (this one's up there with the online sample menu.... just come back with it; there's only two of us!), to the point I got tired of trying to catch her attention and paid at the bar. Always find it a bit of a cheek when the card machine asks if you want to leave gratuity... particularly following mediocre service.  It's close to home so I'm sure we'll give it anotehr bash when the menu changes again, but for now, just a bit meh.",
