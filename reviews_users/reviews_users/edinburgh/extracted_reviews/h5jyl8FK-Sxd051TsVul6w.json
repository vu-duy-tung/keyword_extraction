    "text": "This was some of the absolute best Italian food I've ever had. The sauces were delicious. I had the spinach ravioli and it was a cream based sauce which usually upsets my stomach, but it didn't hurt at all after. It was so rich and creamy and the spinach in both the sauce and ravioli was phenomenal. Honestly better or tied with a lot of Italian food I've had in Italy. Very accommodating and nice staff as well. Gluten free options too- my friend is gluten intolerant and she said the pasta they use is the best gluten free pasta she's ever had.",

I've had pumpkin ravioli which has stood out more than the dish I had here the other week but the overall feel and buzz of the place easily counters any negativity on that front.   Somewhere local to definitely go back to.",

Service was attentive & friendly, the choices of specials was mind-boggling in its variety.   All our dishes were perfectly prepared & served. Between us all we must have covered most of the food types and everything impressed us.   Would definitely recommend & hope to return.",

    "text": "Absolutely fantastic dining experience. Food was so fresh, tasty and immaculately presented. While the wine menu wasn't vastly extensive, each of the 3 bottles we got were very high quality and great vintages. Staff very knowledgable with the menu and attentive in their service. 7/8 staff front of house for such a small restaurant ensures you are well looked after.  Booking is essential as we found it quite hard to get a decent time for a Sunday evening a few days prior. Like previous reviewer I am in shock that there are hardly any reviews for this place, given it has been here for over 3 years.",

    "text": "italian is a cuisine that is done a lot.  pretty much anywhere you go in the world there will be an italian restaurant so when it's done right it just really hits the spot.  i'd heard a lot of good things about Nonna's Kitchen and as i wandered there on a very windy edinburgh day my expectations were set high.  from the outside the restaurant looks much bigger than it is on the inside.  but that's not really a worry as there is a good amount of seating and the tables aren't too close together.  however, it's definitely advisable to book as it's clear that this place gets busy at peak times.  Nonna's has a standard menu with a large variety between pizza, pastas, and main dishes.  they also have a fairly extensive specials list which is pretty impressive itself.  feeling a bit under the weather from a rather heavy night before i opted for a comfort food dish of spaghetti and meatballs and sharing the spicy pizza bread with my two friends for a starter.  the pizza bread arrived in good time which was good since i was starving.  the chilli tomato sauce was spicy without being over powering and was really tasty to snack on while waiting for our mains.  the wait wasn't too long and soon my spaghetti and meatballs was in front of me.  it was a good sized dish with three large meatballs sat on top of a fairly largeish pile of spaghetti.  in my delicateish state i managed to eat the lot and it was absolutely delicious.  very close to the quality of my mum's homemade meatballs.  being stuffed from my main course i opted against dessert although tried a spoonful of my friend's sundae which was nice as well.  the price for a starter and main was 17 with tip so not too hard on the purse.  the service was attentive (sometimes a bit over so by the manager...) but friendly and overall it was a really enjoyable meal in a lovely and warm restaurant.",

Although waiting times are slightly long it was well worth it. All the staff were polite and kind and the place had a relaxed atmosphere. This is possibly the best italien food in morning side. i recomend that you visit here soon.",

    "text": "My favourite local restaurant! Cosy, friendly atmosphere. The food is amazing and reasonably priced for the quality of it. It's only eating freshly cooked pasta here that has made me realise how badly done it is in most places do it. I love their seafood linguine. And their specials are always a real treat. The only thing that would improve this place is for it to be double the size, as it's always busy (and always forget to book) and can feel a little cramped at its busiest. But this is a minor detail and there's a reason why it's so busy!",
