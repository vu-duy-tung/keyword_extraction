    "text": "Although not exactly the kind of food you'd expect to try on your very first visit in Edinburgh, I still enjoyed it quite a lot.   To get here you have to go down one of the narrow alley ways called Advocates close.  My friend who studies in Edinburgh suggested we go because she likes this place a lot. A very big restaurant with a nice open floor design for the kitchen.  Service was fast and the waitresses were nice.  I ordered the spaghetti bolognese and it was good, a classic. I also ordered the lobster tails for desert and although the flaky crust was a bit burnt, the melted chocolate to dip was delicious! So gooooood.",

We ate here 3 times during our stay at the Old Town Chambers (the luxury serviced apart/hotel beside the restaurant) as they offer guests of the hotel a free glass of prosecco! The food was good and on the affordable side. They have lots of 'lighter' menu options as well, which I was a fan of being a full time traveler!",

    "text": "This place was very close to our apartment so we decided to try it. I heard it's a chain restaurant so we thought it would be good. If you want to get a View from your table just ask to see if there are any tables available along the back. We were lucky enough to get a view of the Belmoral hotel! We started off with their garlic bread. This was amazing! You have to order it. We also tried their bruschetta, which was also amazing! So from these foods, we thought our main course would be great as well. Well, my husband's dish, which was a Seabass dish was delicious. But my pizza tasted like from a cardboard box. You know like Celeste. Which equals the one dollar frozen pizzas at your local grocery store. Not sure if it was because I got their classic option versus the rustic option. But it was horrible. The kids spaghetti was ok.  So I guess my only bad review was on the pizza. Everything else was all right. But being that this was a pizza joint, you would think the pizzas would be amazing. Just keep that in mind if you try this place out.",

They always have an offer on and I always seem to forget about it so I could be saving myself a small fortune.    Zizzi's is a chain, so it's a simple menu. It's one of the few chains I like. Any pizza or pasta dish or actually any dish I've ordered has been good and tasty. I like looking at the specials board to see if there is anything new on the board to try.   It's handy to meet mates and grab a quick working lunch although we've had to chase to pay the bill when we need to leave!",

    "text": "Zizzi's is one of those chains (a bit like pizza express or prezzo) that's easy and familiar and nearly always has some sort of offer on. They have a few different restaurants in Edinburgh, but tonight for the first time I visited their Roxburgh Court restaurant, which opened last year.   It's tucked away off the Royal Mile, down Mary King's Close. I was surprised at the lack of signs for it on the Royal Mile, but I quite liked the way it was tucked away. Like I mentioned, these restaurants always have some sort of offer on, so in we went, armed with our '50% off' voucher.  The place was lovely inside, and staff were very friendly as we entered. The menu was much the same as any Zizzi's restaurant, filled with pizzas, pastas, calzones, risottos and a few meat and fish dishes. We started with delicious mozarella garlic bread- this had got to be the BEST garlic bread ever. I big wooden platter, laden with melty, gooey, caramelised oniony, garlicky goodness! The portion is super huge so could do for 2 people (probably more, but hey, once you've tasted it you'll not want to share too much!) We also got some delicious calamari with a lemony mayo.   The mains were great too, I was there with my family and we got a whole mixture of pizzas and pastas. They do lovely thin rustica pizzas and my mum had something called a spiedini which was a sort of hanging skewer with prawns, salmon, sea bream, pepper and courgettes. At the end of the meal my Gran told us it was 'the best pasta she had ever eaten' so they were doing something right! We finished off with some gelato to share, and it was lovely (if a little small.)  The restaurant has a lovely view out across Princes Street and the Balmoral and we saw some Edinburgh trams passing by. With it being a large chain you sort of know what to expect with Zizzi's and it's not maybe the most exciting place to eat. Saying that, they have some great offers and the food is tasty. I think this restaurant was nicer than other branches I have been to.",

    "text": "How in the world does this chain restaurant have 4 stars on Yelp? Olive Garden has better Italian meals and their meals come with bread and salad! Located in a fun nook in the Real Mary's close, the restaurant has the potential to be interesting but wasn't good. They didn't have our reservations even though we'd already received a confirmation email but were nice about accommodating us. The wait staff was pleasant and the wine was good. However the food was less the spectacular; it was even less than good. My husband ordered the beef and venison strozzapreti and flavors were ok but there was very little sauce, flavor or meat. I ordered the penne Della casa, a baked dish. Rather than a nice cheesy baked crust, it arrived  a runny mess with thin sauce lots of pasta, a few pieces of over cooked chicken and a few traces of spinach and pancetta. After my husband was finished with his meal, the server came back to check on us (the restaurant wasn't very busy) and did offer to bring me something else. I declined having lost all faith in their food selections. There are far better dining options in Edinburgh.",

A surprisingly nice venue, very centrally located in Edinburgh, with views down towards Princes Street. There's a small courtyard for some al fresco dining when the weather is appropriate.  I had crab linguine, which was excellent, washed down with a couple of Morettis. I'll definitely dine there again.",
