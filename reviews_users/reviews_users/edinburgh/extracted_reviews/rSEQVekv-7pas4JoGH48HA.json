Very good location and the weather was nice so we ate outside which made for a very pleasant experience indeed.   I am feeling generous as I am aware of how difficult it is to keep new businesses afloat. I ordered the brisket sandwich which had horseradish mayo and some slaw. In my opinion it was a bit a dry, I didn't hesitate to ask for a dollop more of the beautiful mayo and some onions to give it a little extra kick. The owner obliged and after said adjustments I thoroughly enjoyed my sandwich.   My better half ordered the club sandwich which was really tasty. It had 3 layers of very hearty sourdough and some cheese which I am going to say was jarlsberg. Then a trio of meats, pastrami, turkey and bacon all smothered in mayo and tomatoes. We split both sandwiches so we could both have the best of both worlds.  I like the feel of this place. The owners were very nice and welcoming and the location is really nice.",

    "text": "Having walked past this place time and time again this week, finally decided to stop in and get my lunch from here today. I regret not having come in sooner!  I had a duck & slaw wrap, which was toasted and a small portion of sweet potato & roasted yellow pepper soup. 5 well spent! They do have a table and a few chairs outside but they were in the shade so I took my food to the benches just up the way to sit in the sun.  The couple (making assumptions here) behind the counter are full of smiles & super friendly, he's South African and she's Polish.. He does all the cooking, she apparently hates cooking! So kudos must go to him on a superb house made slaw.. apple, celery, thick slices of cabbage & carrot, lovely amount of crunch and acidity to balance out the richness of the duck. Can imagine it would have gone fantastic with some pulled pork but they'd sold out of the pork already.  I was expecting the soup to be quite sweet (as most sweet potato soups tend to be) hence why I only got a small portion, but I was pleasantly surprised to taste the smokiness of the roast peppers and to find the soup was in fact quite savoury.  Deli side of the store is a bit sparse at the moment, Relish around the corner have a much bigger range of stuff. But I think given time, their range of items will grow.  Possibly one of the best lunches I've had this week, highly recommend!",

    "text": "I had the most delicious lunch today and I want to tell the world about it :)  There is a new kid on the block - in the form of Shore Deli, which opened just 3 weeks ago. The premises were previously occupied by Fleur's Deli.  I'm quite happy about this change, as the place has been spruced up and it now looks modern and more 'alive'.   I usually just have a soup for lunch, but sometimes a girl needs to treat herself.. Especially when they are offering wraps such as bbq pulled pork with homemade coleslaw. The wrap was toasted and filled with delicious, succulent pulled pork and slaw. I could not fault it it any way, it was just right. I paid 3.30.  They were also offering 2 different kinds of soups, and you can request a small, medium or a large soup. The sandwiches on the counter looked absolutely amazing and would satisfy any appetite, I'm sure.   Shore Deli, being a deli, also sell fine food products such as Scottish Heather Tea and ... Wonton Wraps, should you run out of either :)",
