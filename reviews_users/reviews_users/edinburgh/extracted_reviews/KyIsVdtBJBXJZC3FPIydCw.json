    "text": "In a state of major coffee withdrawal post-gym workout, I wandered into the Skylark cafe (mostly because the steps to grounds suddenly became so much harder!)  A very cute interior with additional seating in the back, this cafe is bigger than it looks.   The service was super friendly and I had a lovely chat with the Barista whilst waiting for my coffee.   Personally, I like my coffee strong and hot. What I do not like is lukewarm faint coffee-tasting milk. Unfortunately this was the latter, I think the cups are too big so it was a fail for me.   The saving grace is the great service and varied menu that I still very much want to try. They also stock pana chocolaye- the new craze from Melbourne (you're welcome!) to the UK. Skylark is now my official chocolate dealer.",

    "text": "I've walked past the Skylark a few times. Each time, I was drawn to it because it always looked so cosy and sweet inside.   I recently popped in for lunch, going for the soup and a sandwich; a lovely winter afternoon pick-me-up. I just love thicker blended soups and so the dreamy vegetable-coconut fusion du jour was heaven to me, and the mozzarella and pesto sandwich made for the perfect soup-dipping vehicle.   The sandwich itself was a lovely puffy pitta; somewhere between a flatbread and a pitta. The result made for a really filling lunch. Next time, I want to try one of their smoothies as the selection sounded delicious.  It's a lot bigger than it looks, with a hidden back room and a mini play spot for the little ones. Service was lovely and friendly too. - I look forward to my next visit!",

    "text": "I only came in here recently for a cup of latte and a bit of rest time with my toddler because I had heard this cafe has an indoor play area for kids. Although the play area was smaller than I expected, it was great to be able to let my 1.5 year old son play safely with the toys there while I relaxed with my cup of coffee. There is also supposed to be a music time for babies/toddlers each weekday mornings so I will have to check that out soon sometime.",
