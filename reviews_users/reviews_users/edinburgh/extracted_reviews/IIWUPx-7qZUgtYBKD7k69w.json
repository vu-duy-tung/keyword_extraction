(He starts saying, a bit too loudly, \"it's dissolving in my mouth!  I don't have to chew it!  This is amazing\")   The last 4 days through half of Scotland and England we have been trying to find something close... May need to drive back, pay the admission fee and have one more before we go.",

    "text": "Total tourist trap I'm afraid, I advise if you're going to the castle then take a packed lunch. We went for the kids meal option which is any 5 items for 5 as we needed something to fill us up until we went out for a meal a little later.   For 5 we got two tiny, dry baps with cheese (no butter...but why?), a small, cheap yoghurt, grapes and a juice box. The grapes were the only half decent thing. The baps were so dry we couldn't chew the bread. Not suitable for adults let alone kids.   There was a seagull nearby, she enjoyed some of the bread so not all was lost :)",

The redcoat cafe serves delicious hot meals, cakes and scones, however as you might imagine it can be a bit pricey but well worth the money I feel. Staff are lovely too, very professional and very helpful. No complaints.",

    "text": "If you're spending the day at the castle, you're probably going to need something to eat. There are two restaurant/cafe locations on the grounds (and you aren't allowed re-entry on your tickets...we checked).  We chose the Redcoat Cafe because they had several items on offer, and it seemed more casual than the table-service restaurant across the compound. As you walk in, you're face-to-face with several different options, but directly in front of the door sits the sweets bar. Devious placement on their part, and it totally worked on me. I went in seeking savory nourishment, and walked to my table with a piece of cake added on. Figures.  The cafe offers both grab-and-go cold sandwich offerings and hot entrees. We went with the hot entree - a haggis, neeps and tatties pie, which was served with fries and potatoes (overload on starch, lemme tell ya!)  The dining area is quite large, so we had no issues finding a table. At that time, though, all the \"good\" tables - the ones with the spectacular views of the city - were all taken.  Oh - tip! If you want water with your meal, and don't mind tap, don't buy bottled. They have a pitcher of tap water and a bucket of ice on a table near the silverware, which you can get for free.  The food was pretty good, though very filling. I wasn't kidding when I said the meal we decided on was starch overload - we had potatoes three ways. But, it was filling, it stuck to our ribs and it gave us energy to finish out the day at the castle.",

My wife had ravioli. It was all very good. Of course it's pricey. It's a tourist's cafe in Great Britain. The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was pleasant and comfortable. It was a nice break from the 20 mph wind outside. We thought it was fine.",

I had to relieve myself of the little cash that the entrance fee hadn't already mugged me of to get one though. From inside at the back there is a view over Edinburgh, or you can sit out in the courtyard and drink it all in! Wonderful beer, wonderful location, hideously overpriced.",

The place composed of two rooms - both spacious with lots of places to sit. As for the cafe itself it's not 'mind-blowing' as for decor but the food makes up for it. As for such interestingly based place be prepared for high prices. The range of meals is wide (as so is the drinks list) and should satisfy anyone.  Worth of checking out while touring the Castle (even for a coffee or a sandwich - every meal is fresh and daily made!)",
