    "text": "This a great place to have a wonderful taco experience. There is Happy Hour between 4-6pm. This includes certain taco selection along with margaritas specials. The steak taco is the best taco here. It's amazing here. We had a bartender name Juan. He was great suggesting stuff and wasn't pushy. The hot sauce is to die for. I was able to get some to go and wrapped airlock tight for my flight home. Washroom are amazing, each stalls has its own TV/movies. At night time the exterior is all lit up with torches- very Tiki inspired.",

    "text": "Great place to find Mexican food in Edinburgh. We had to wait for about on our during our second visit, but it was well spent in the bar trying some margaritas and delicious drinks.  For food they have many plates suitable for sharing, or if you prefer to have the food for yourself they have plenty of alternatives. I would suggest trying any of the menus, and complement with some snack tacos or nacho plates for sharing. Don't forget the drinks!  The staff is service minded and friendly. Prices are good to, but then again, as a Scandinavian it's always cheaper to eat and drink out in other countries ;-)",

They are super yummy and lasted about 5 minutes with my family of 4.  Also wanted to add that the Hibiscus Margarita is a winner! And the service is, by far, the most attentive we have had here in Edinburgh so far. Julio, our server, definitely deserves a shout out. Give this place a try, it won't disappoint.",

The only shortcoming was lack of salsa for dipping. Server revealed that decision comes from corporate in London -  heads up there. Quesadillas should be served with salsa!!",

    "text": "I'm a big fan of Mexican food. And I've been a fan of Wahaca since discovering it in London many years ago, so it's great to see it open it's doors in Edinburgh.   The new venue is big, modern and colourful. There is a kitchen in the middle downstairs and surprisingly a lot of seats upstairs. It was busy (and quite loud) for 6pm on a weeknight. They have a lot of tables unreserved so we didn't need to wait.   I think if you go to Wahacas you really need to get their street food, which comes as it is ready. Between two of us we had some lamb taquitos, honey cornbread, chicken quesadillas, steak tacos, poblano taco, chorizo frijoles. And some margaritas. The taquitos were probably the highlight, and I'd definitely be getting the chorizo again. There is a lot of stuff here you will find in most similar mexican places, but it's done pretty well. At 5 a dish it's reasonably priced.   It's a bustling kind of place and the food arrived promptly; it's not somewhere you are going to sit for a long relaxed evening. But for a few beers or drinks and some tacos in town it's definitely going to be somewhere I come back to. There is also an app which allows you to pay on your phone which was pretty convenient.   It's not been open a week and so there are still some problems with the service. People didn't quite know what was going on, bringing the wrong dishes to wrong table, a lot of checking with the manager. Hopefully they will sort these issues out and when they settle in more.  I'd still go to El Cartel if I want the best mexican in town but when I don't want to queue and for a quick street food fix  I suspect I may be back here.",

    "text": "So I  had been looking forward to this place opening since I first discovered they were coming to Edinburgh. On a whim we decided to pop in during October week for lunch.   We were seated immediately downstairs. The drinks came quick as did the food. We had a childrens menu, and I had some street food. I went for that days special, the deep fried crispy poblano tacos and some pork tacos pibil.   The poblano tacos were DELICIOUS. Seriously I am thinking of coming in again just for them. The poblano pepper is crispy with just a hint of spice smothered in sauces. Really so tasty. After having such a tasty taco I would think it difficult for any other taco to live up to this amazingness.  The pork pibil taco was good. Not as great as the poblano but it was very filling. I would have liked more sauce on it but it was still pretty damn tasty just a wee bit dry.   We also had the chips and salsa, and the salsa was very fresh & tasty. For dessert we had the churros & chocolate. This plate comes with three churros covered in cinnamon and sugar and a small cup of the most potent chocolate known to man kind. OMG that is some serious chocolate! Very tasty to dip the churros in but hard to finish.   The kids meal was good too. Probably the best quesadilla we have had at a restaurant since we have left California. The mix of monterey jack and mozzarella made it perfectly cheesy.   All in all very happy with the meal and will be coming back! Hopefully they put that Poblano taco on the permanent menu!!!",

The service was great- the woman who served us was so kind and profusely apologized for a delay in bringing out drinks- and then made it a point to check in on us after to make sure we were satisfied with our food.  Onto the food: the vegetarian tacos hit the spot- the flavors were delicious and not your typical over grilled veggies! Definitely a place to share plates and order family style. I'd return the next time I'm in Edinburgh- conveniently located near the main train station.",

    "text": "It is almost impossible to find good Mexican food in the UK in general, but especially in Scotland. Everything is always watered down or bland and just not right. While it's a little more on the hipster side, Wahaca actually has a pretty decent selection. The biggest thing for me was that they have horchata on the menu. I almost died when I saw this because I've been craving it since I moved here. It was good, but very watery- an easy fix. The watermelon margarita was made with fresh watermelon juice, which I appreciated. As for food, we tried a mix of different things to get a feel for it and found it to be kind of 50/50. The chips and guac were pretty standard- nothing amazing but not bad. We also got the ancho chicken taco, steak taco with cheese, black bean tostada, and the chorizo quesadilla. The steak taco was my favorite thing hands down and I loved the cheese added on. My second favorite was the chorizo quesadilla, but my partner didn't like it. I didn't like the sweetness of the salsa on the chicken taco, and I can't remember what I thought of the tostada. I feel like it was okay. The portions were really small, which was unfortunate. I wish they did bigger orders of tacos. I also went to the taco truck and was again impressed with the steak tacos. Also, I have a vegetarian friend and this place has tons of options for vegans/vegetarians, which I think is awesome. All in all, the food wasn't bad, the service was great, and I'd definitely come back!",
