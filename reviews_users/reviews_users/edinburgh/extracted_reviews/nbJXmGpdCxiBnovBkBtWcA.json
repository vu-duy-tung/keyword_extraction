    "text": "This is my favorite restaurant in Edinburgh. I love mussels, and this place makes some GREAT mussels. Huge tureens - you can get full or half kilo pot - of fresh mussels cooked in several different flavor bases.   I tried the Shallot (white wine, garlic and shallots), which was divine! I was very curious about the Moroccan and Mexican pots and will try one next time I am in town. They also have the most delicious fresh baked crusty bread, for dipping in the broth.   We had chilled Oysters to start - with a bottle of wine and good friends - perfect evening and perfect meal!",

    "text": "While on a short visit to Edinburgh a friend and I wandered into Mussel Inn in search of something to satisfy our seafood craving.   The ambiance in casual and relaxed without being too informal. Our server was brilliant and very knowledgeable about everything they served. I cant have dairy, but was desperate for the seafood pasta. He suggested that he would have a chat with the chef and - voila - I got seafood pasta with a dairy-free red pepper sauce. This goes down as a HUGE plus in my book. We also started with a huge pot of steamed mussels which were heavenly and a great (but inexpensive) bottle of white wine.  This place is everything I love about a restaurant. The staff is casual yet attentive, the food is simple and spot on, the prices are reasonable, the ambiance is relaxed and not rushed. I look forward to returning the next time Im in Edinburgh.",

I came here the other day for the fabulous lunch deal where I chose a bowl of mussels with fries and a glass of white wine for only 7.50, what a bargain! Service was really quick and I think that this menu is designed for people of their work break so the fast service ensures they get back on time, how considerate! The mussels were amazing if a little bit messy to eat, but I'm really messy anyway. The portion was large and the red pepper dressing I opted for was amazing.  We sat outside and I actually felt like I was on holiday watching all the people walking along Rose Street, it was a glorious day!",

Nestling in a big rustic pot, available in plenty of delicious varieties (Shallot being my choice), and accompanied by some chunky bread are the Mussel Inn's showpiece: you guessed it, Mussels. If your feeling macho you can even order a kilo of the unsightly gems, around 12 for that liberty.  One word of warning: you may arrive smelling of sweet perfume and with freshly washed skin, but by the time you exit your clothes will stink of garlic infused cooking oil and other kitchen smells.   It's all part of a decent dining experience though.",

    "text": "I gathered that on my very first visit to the Mussel Inn I should really sample the mussels. I am a huge seafood fan, but the thought of eating things out of shells, especially mussel shells for some reason fills me with dread. I also walked into a chipshop once and witnessed a really fat man gorging them out of a glass jar and that kind of put me off for life.  However, I decided to stop being petulant and get stuck in. We actually got there just in time for the lunchtime quickie menu which runs from 12-2.30pm on weekdays and comes in at a very reasonable 7.50. The restaurant itself is nice and spacious, the tables are well spaced and there is plenty of room for a bit of privacy whilst eating- I hate being jammed in a restaurant and listening to the couple next to me arguing.  I had the bowl of mussels with red pepper sauce and a glass of white wine. You could choose from mussels with a range of sauces or seafood chowder which my mum had, and she said it was amazing! The mussels looked and smelt beautiful, but there is just something about them that I can't get to grips with and I ended up leaving quite a lot of the dish, but with absolutely no disrespect to the chef who cooked them beautifully and the sauce was so yummy I dipped quite a few slices of bread in!   We were in and out within the hour, perfect for our quick shopping pit stop. Next time, no mussels for me!",

    "text": "Mmmmm, I like mussels. I know some people get a bit squeamish about mussels because they just look a bit squishy and like there's a bit too much going on inside them, but quite honestly there's nothing I like better than a nice lunch or dinner involving mussel chomping. I think it's also the novelty of prising open shells and scooping up the sauce which makes me warm to a good mussel dish, as it makes the whole experience extra fun. Now I've made myself sound like an infant that needs to be entertained while she's eating....anyway, if you're passionate about mussels and other related seafoodie delights, the Mussel Inn is a reliably great place to come to on Rose St.  Always busy, and with sharp service, the Mussel Inn has a good friendly feel to it, and the menu has a brilliant range of mussels by the kilo or half kilo, which you can team with a range of sauces. There are also lots of scallops options, as well as oysters and some really tasty starters to be had too.",

I was missing my boyfriend who was studying in London at the time and my buddy was looking to cheer me up. Four or five drinks later we stumbled into the Mussel Inn because clearly seafood would help out our alcohol lined stomachs. We ate mussels and clams and basket after basket of bread. I remember raving about the garlicky taste and drunkenly asking the waiter to compliment the chef. We also drank some more... I have vague memories of being very loud and asking to play with a nearby tables toddler. They said no.   Two hours later I was on the Sleeper train to London...",

Because of this, I rarely bother with them even though I find mussels incredibly tasty, but The Mussel Inn's lunchtime deal was just too good to resist on a recent visit.  To be controversial, I actually went for the chowder instead of the mussels, and found it to be utterly fantastic and full of fishy goodness. I wasn't in the mood for wine so just had a coke while E-Bot slugged back her glass of white, but with a big bowl of fries on the side as well, the 7.50 price was an absolute steal.",

They do tend to cram you in so probably not the best bet for a romantic meal but for a great cheap lunch with lovely fresh food, then its a good choice.  Mussels, chips and a glass of wine/beer/soft drink is 7.95. Non mussel eaters can have cullen skint. Mussels are fresh and well prepared, with lots of options of sauce. I like the white wine and shallot and it does tend to be my default choice. I did find that this visit, I had a lot of closed mussels in my portion which isn't ideal so only 3 stars for this visit but the rest of the family enjoyed their cullen skink.  I'm now as wowed as I was when I first discovered it in Glasgow (they were better at filling the bread basket then) but for a decent lunch in the centre of town, then it is worth a visit.",

I nipped in for what's billed as a 'lunchtime quickie' today and have to say it wasn't too bad overall, given you get mussels, a small glass of wine, a bowl of chips and bread and butter for 7.50.  You do have to have your wits about you though, as the mussels that normally come in either kilo or half kilo sizes are reduced to a smaller bowl size for this deal option. You might be a bit disappointed with this if you're expecting the usual metal pot to arrive on your table.  That leaves me with my only minor gripe - the smell! There was a less than wholesome undertone in the air today that, had it been any stronger, would have had me squeezing the lemon wedge onto my top lip (in CSI pre-autopsy stylee) rather than into my bowl of mussels.  Hopefully just a bad day in the kitchen.",

    "text": "With branches in Edinburgh and Glasgow, the Mussel Inn has long been established as a good seafood restaurant. But with freshly opened Seadogs muscling in on Mussel Inn's turf, it might have to up its game just a little.  Saying that, I always find this establshment consistently good, with efficient service as Eleanor suggested. With its plain but pleasant decor and no fuss approach to dining, their menu is easy enough to figure out. You have the option of choosing mussles ans scallops with a variety of delicious sauces which are always creamy and bring out the flavour of the seafood without drowning them. I have vowed to try them all in my time but can recommend the cheesy sauce and, a more recent venture, the spicier option.   As Eleanor rightly outlined, Mussel Inn seems to cater well to its potential business customers who are looking for a quick but tasty lunch. It's also a good place to try seafood for the first time as their mussels are delicious, but if you happen to chicken out they also do pasta. It's a messy first date because, if you're like me, you will practically shove your face in that bowl to hoover the gorgeous mussels up, but I quite like the hands on approach to dining! A firm favourite, it still goes does swimmingly well.",

I heard about this place and really wanted to try it so once I did I had high expectations. It was good food, I had the Moroccan mussels the big one, and it was tasty and very spicy which I liked. The broth was also good, not great but good. Over all it was a good meal , if not a little pricy for me. The menu is not to big not to small. Beer goes well with the mussel pot I think. You have the wine sauce they are cooked in, so another glass of wine kind of over does it. A beer compliments it very well I believe . So it's a good restaurant , kind service, fresh seafood. I give it a thumbs up, if your visiting or just love locally harvested mussels go here!",

My joy started when the smell of the delicious steamed mussels hit me as I walked in the door. It made me more hungry. I had the mussels steamed in white wine, shallots and cream. A half kilo was the perfect size (35 in all). A buddy had the Moroccan style and they were even better -- amazing how the flavor infused the mussels. great for dipping bread into.   Argula heavy house salad and a value priced Sauvignon Blanc rounded out the dinner. The starter of raw oysters was just ok -- not as good as the ones I get on the east coast of the USA. Still a great dinner experience. Would go back in a heart beat. It was the best dining experience we had in Edinburgh.",

The shallot creme broth looked like skim milk and didn't have a ton of flavor.  Some toasted / grilled crusty bread is usually what I like but instead you just get some regular old table bread.  The mussels were fine, pretty small.  I also got the lobster Thermidor.  It was 17 quid for half of one.  I'm from New England so I'm pretty used to eating lobster.   It was very tiny.  The Maine you would have to legally throw them back at that size.  Definitely less than a pound.  It was served over a sad looking salad and a few potatoes.   Recommendation:  If you go, just get the mussels.  Otherwise pass.   It must pay to be in Go Scotland! books or something.",

    "text": "While my sis and I were in the early stages of a weeklong holiday through Scotland, we needed a place to eat for dinner on the first night. Walking around the streets of Glasgow, we stumbled upon this place. After examining the menu we gave it a shot.   Looking around at the other tables, my sis was intrigued when we saw that several tables were dining with giant pots of mussels. I am usually not a big fan of the dish, but she was willing to give them a shot. I settled on a seafood chowder for an app and a Crab Pasta (White crab meat cooked in lime, chilli and coriander) for a main dish.  Just an opinion: maybe it's just the character of European chefs, but these dishes definitely tasted different and way better than plates that would be served from home. The chowder tasted fresh, meatier and had just the right spice to it. The Crab pasta was served with angel hair pasta (I expected bigger noodles but this dish turned out ok). My sis feasted on the pot of clams.  The waitress was great and the service time was fast. We both had happy stomachs after that night. We were planning on visiting Edinburgh later on in the trip so naturally visiting the other restaurant was in the plans. After finding the place we wandered in and had high expectations.  On our second trip, my sis ended up ordering and feasting on the same pot of mussels. I ended up ordering a different set of dishes: Fish Cakes (with mixed leaves served with a light lemon and saffron mayonnaise) for an app and Sea Bass (grilled fillet served on a rocket, feta, warm new potato and roasted red pepper salad, drizzled with balsamic dressing) for a main course. Both dishes exceeded expectations.   The only bad part about our second visit was how slow the service was. We were the first people to get seated when the place opened that day but must have waited a while to get served. Not to mention how long we sat there waiting for the check.  All in all, a mixed bag of a review. The food was excellent both times we were there; however the service at the Edinburgh restaurant could have used a bit of improvement.",

Have to say it checks all the boxes to satisfy my obsession with top-quality seafood at reasonable prices. This time, I had the special mussels - lemongrass and ginger - and some oysters. Oysters here are one of the best values I've seen in the UK 9 for 6, which a few years ago would have seemed egregious to me, but it's a good price for Britain, especially considering these were perfectly shucked, no popped bellies, no shell shrapnel and plenty of delicious liquor in the shells. Sadly, the mussels were overcooked when they arrived, but the friendly-if-frenzied server made sure the problem was corrected immediately and the second attempt yielded a perfect pot.  The location in New Town makes this place great for visitors who want a break from the usual slew of frozen pre-packed chain food on offer in many of the nearby places, at prices that don't break the bank. It's close the major tourist attractions and Waverley Station. Definitely worth a visit.",

We returned for the first time in about 10 years.  Know what? Liked it - didn't love it; it's been overtaken by other venues. Good quality food served simply.  Lots of seafood options (with a couple of burger, pasta options) with the focus on kilos of fresh mussels with a range of tasty sauces.  I usually enjoy the iced oysters but this time went for the 6 \"queenies\" (scallops) which were grilled with garlic butter; delicious!  Decent puddings; good selection of wine; friendly service; reasonably priced.",

Last visit a mate and I sat al fresco and got to enjoy Rose St in the sunshine, which was a treat in itself and even more so glass of white wine in hand. He went for the roasted red pepper and pesto mussel pot and I went for the white wine and garlic. Both were delicious, with hardly any closed shells. They also keep you well topped up with dunkably soft bread that I ate far too much of whilst trying to soak up every last drop of the sauce.  There's a wide variety of other things on the menu, even for non-mussel-lovers who've been dragged along. Friendly staff will put a smile on your face too - they're v efficient at turning tables over without hurrying you and attentive even when the place was rammed.  Give it a try - the lunch deal is just such good value, you might pull a mussel! (A pun too far?! Yeah, probably should've quit while I was ahead. Ahem I'll be off now).",

I opted for the blue cheese and bacon mussels, but there are a selection of broths to choose from.  Their seafood chowder is also really fantastic.   Super friendly establishment.

I'd been here twice before, but my friend had never been, so on the day of arrival, the hotel concierge directed us to the restaurant which was in walking distance from the Waldorf Astoria.   But we found it wasn't open yet (think they close between 3-5pm) so we went to a coffee shop for a while.  When they opened, we went in and having not booked a table, they gave us a table but said we only had two hours. That was fine.  We ordered starters, my friend had whitebait and I had oysters! They were really good! Then we both had bowls of mussels in different flavours, they were delicious. We were given basket of bread with the main.  I recommend this place, plus you should ring up an book a table if there are a lot of you or you want a table at a particular time!!",

I'm happy to say that Mussel Inn didn't veer too far in either direction; our mussels were nicely spiced, steamed and flavorful, with perfectly solid service and a kind front of house that found us a table on a very busy evening. And prices were far from unreasonable; not cheap but not nearly as horrifying as I expected. Made for a satisfying meal downtown.",

(Well, at least that's what my partner would say after devouring half a kilo of mussels for less than 7 with lots of bread for dipping in their \"juice\", which is extremely tasty!)  The must try dish are the mussels! Five flavours: natural (their own juice), Shallot (my favourite! White wine, garlic, shallots, cream), Roasted peppers, Moroccan, and Blue Cheese!   According to their menu: \"Our mussels are grown on ropes in sea lochs on the West of Scotland and the Shetland Isles. They feed naturally in the plankton rich waters. Sustainability and care for the environment are of utmost importance to our growers.\"  There is a very good selection of starters as well, along with one or two day specials, and soup of the day. More main dishes of course, including even a burger, scallops etc.   This time I tried their crab pasta: white crab meat cooked in lime, chilli and coriander! It wasn't hot like some Indian dishes, but it was medium spicy! The pasta looked more like noodles, and it was quite filling surprisingly! (I did share it with my partner so that we both try mussels!)   The waiting staff are very friendly and polite, they might be quite busy from time to time.   Make sure you book in advance to avoid disappointment or wait time. You'll get a window of about two hours, the service is fast and the location is ideal in the city centre (no sea-views unfortunately, but the decoration could be from a fisher's place next to the sea ;-) ).   Already looking forward to my next visit!!",

We ordered a pot of mussels with white wine and cream and they kept refilling the bread, which was fresh and used it to dip the sauce with.  We had to go a second time after that.  The next time I went to Scotland with a friend while backpacking, and I had to drag her to this place.  She agreed but had no idea why I was so excited to go.  We didn't have a reservation, but were nice enough to give us a small table since it was just the two of us.  The server took our orders and I was eager for my friend to try it.  The mussels came to our table hot and steaming from the pot, and as my friend had her first bite, her eyes lit up,  scooched the pot closer to her side of the table and used the fork to stab my hand whenever I reached over for some and said \"None for you!  Its all mine!\" And of course we went a second time that week!  I don't know what it was, but I think the rain added to the experience of eating that pot of mussels.  It was just so warm and cozy, oh! and the service was great too!",

I got the seafood chowder while my wife gobbled down her half-kilo of mussels (which by the way, she loved). I was very impressed by the chowder and despite not eating a single mussel, I had a very enjoyable and filling meal.

The portion sizes were just right and price-wise it's pretty good. Of course, if you're not one for mussels, then there are other dishes to try that are just as good :)  The food is simple and clean but full of flavor with a great wait staff! Would definitely come back and recommend to friends if they haven't got the time to hit the coast xx",

Had the crevettes as a starter, good though could have used a touch of something more to make it great, maybe a more originally seasoned dipping sauce. As a main went for the mussels which were very nice. Good wine selection as well",

    "text": "Pretty good. Went here on the last night in Edinburgh after the Festival Fringe. We saw tables available outside, and went inside, who said the wait for a table would be about an hour. I asked, \"what about outside?\" and she took us there immediately. Not sure what that was about.  Let's talk about the haggis bonbons. Obviously, the words \"haggis\" and \"bonbons\" don't belong in the same dish. Neither does \"spicy tomato sauce\". Honestly, one of the best appetizers I've had in a while. It shouldn't go together, but it does. Extremely well!   The shellfish pasta, was however, less exciting. 3/4 of the mussels in it were closed. The ones that were were only cooked in their own juice, so they didn't have very much flavor. My pasta was a tad overcooked if I'm being picky. The scallops in particular in that dish were excellent, if it had a redeeming factor.  Good dinner overall. A little pricey, but good for a moderate night out in New Town.",

This is one of two locations- the first one being in Glasgow. The style of the menu sort of makes it look like a chain restaurant but it isnt, and nothing else makes it seem that way.  We ate mussels (of course!)- 'natural' style - half a kilo is about 30 and that was the right amount for one person. We also ordered the Hot Seafood platter which was an enormous amount of food- all perfectly well done, and a Caesar salad which had three whole anchovies layers across it- more seafood! The wine list was surprisingly extensive. This place was hopping and we were able to walk in and get a table but you might want to call ahead for a reservation.",

Then we order the seafood pasta with prawns (shrimp), mussels and scallops but there was no scallops but about 18-20 mussels and about 4/5 shrimp. The sauce was good and believe it or not, not a ton of pasta (which is good) when we left I looked at menu to see if pasta was suppose to have scallops and it was but they were out but the mussels were definitely in!

We arrived earlier than our reservation time but they were able to take us to our table. We tried some oysters as an appetizer. This was my first tome trying oysters so I didn't have anything to compare it to but they were good. For our meal, we both ordered an 1/2 kg of mussels. I've never ordered mussels like this before so I wasn't sure what to expect. It was a ton of food and really great value. We loved both mussel pots (shallot and red pepper).

We got there a bit before they opened, and you know it must be good when there were other parties lining up before open as well!   Due to the unseasonably warm weather, we were told that each person could only half a half kilo of mussels each. We had no reference of what that meant, but I think it was the perfect amount for a hungry family of four :) We got a kilo of mussels in shallot sauce which came in a big pot. The sauce adds flavor without being too heavy. Pro tip: save some of the complimentary bread to dip into the sauce and eat with the mussels...sooooo good!! We also got the shellfish pasta as well as the hot seafood platter which were also excellent. Not only is the seafood fresh, but the pasta was fresh as well. For dessert, we got the rocky road parfait, which was recommended by our waiter. It was something I've never had before, and while I'm glad I tried it, I'm not sure I would order it again.",

    "text": "A few of my friends recommended the Mussel Inn, a restaurant that specializes in seafood. The restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating.   For drinks, they had wine, beer, liquer, non alcoholic beverages, and after night drinks. We shared a bottle of Chardonnay, Macon Village. In addition to wine, I ordered a Thistly Cross Cider, which was sweet, tart, and smooth. It reminded me of Angry Orchard Hard Cider.   For dinner, I wanted the Special of the Day: Grilled Seabream Fillet Served on a Mixed Seafood Risotto but it was sold out. I ended up getting a Seafood Chowder and Caesar Salad. The Seafood Chowder consisted of smoky and creamy chowder made with salmon, seabass, celery, onion, potato, and fresh herbs. The Caesar Salad consisted of baby gem lettuce, parmesan, garlic croutons tossed in homemade Caesar dressing and garnished with white anchovies. I didn't like how the baby gem lettuce wasn't very fresh or the taste of the salad dressing.  For dinner, my family shared the Grilled Oysters, Pot of Kilo Mussels - Shallot, Queen Scallops, and Shellfish Pasta. The Grilled Oysters (without the Cheese and Bacon), even after grilled, maintained a briny and grassy flavor. The Pot of Mussels - Shallots consisted of steamed mussels in a flavorful broth made of white wine, garlic, shallots, and cream. The Queen Scallops consisted of queen scallops served on shells grilled in garlic butter. The scallops were delicious but bitsized and not filling. The shellfish pasta consisted of linguine pasta topped with mussels, tiger prawns, and queen scallops that were cooked and poached in housemade shellfish bisque.   We finished our meal with two desserts - Warm Sticky Date Pudding and Banana Walnut Cake. The Warm Sticky Date Pudding was served with toffee sauce and vanilla ice cream. The Banana Walnut Cake was served warm with chopped walnuts, fresh cream and white chocolate sauce. I enjoyed the flavors of Warm Sticky Date Pudding more.",

The scallops were OK, they didn't have much flavor and several were gritty from the sand they contained. The oysters were excellent and tasted like a fresh sea breeze near the shore. I never knew it was possible to taste something so distinct, fresh, and neat, yet there it was. I should have ordered a dozen.  For the main course I decided on the 1/2 kilo of mussels in the blue cheese sauce, which was made with blue cheese, cream, and bacon. It was very flavorful and the mussels were cooked well, although there were one or two which were unopened. I ate almost the whole thing, so if you're looking to share with someone else I recommend the full kilo for two people.  Service was very good and attentive, even though it was completely full when I left. So if you show up around noon, you should be good. If you show up around 12:45 or 1, expect that it will be packed. Almost every seat was full when I left, and the reservation question suddenly made a lot of sense.  Overall it was pretty good, if the prices were lower I would rate it higher. The only real negative was that my clothes, hair, and skin smelled completely of the restaurant for hours after I left.",

    "text": "Came here excited to try seafood from Scotland after hearing rave reviews about it but were completely disappointed.  Came here on the recommendation of our tour guide. We had an evening tour scheduled for 8pm so we gave ourselves an hour and 45 minutes to eat. Ordered grilled oysters, raw oysters and two half kilos of mussels. Our food took SO long to get to us and we watched multiple tables who were seated after us get their entire meal before us. We mentioned to the waiter that we had to get to a tour and asked if he could let the kitchen know we were in a bit of a rush now. Our food did not come until about 7:40 so we literally only had 5 minutes to eat before we had to leave to get to our tour. When we brought it up to the waiter he admitted it was his fault and apologized but the least he could have done was take a glass of wine off our bill. Also the mussels were below average. Not worth it.",

We ordered the fried goats cheese appetizer (yum), the shallot mussel pot (double yum), and the lobster thermidor (triple yum). The lobster was a special and was the highlight of our meal.     I only gave 4 stars due to the lack of ambience in the place. We were there at 9 PM but the lights were on throughout the restaurant full blast. This place would have much better ambience if they dimmed the lights down in the evenings.",

We found heaven in a pot of mussels steamed with shallots. I'm normally not the biggest fan of mussels; because they are often tough and, well, kind of big. The mussels at the Mussel Inn were small, but oh so tender and the broth!!!  It's to die for. We used the bread to just keep soak up the broth we couldn't get by spoon. My daughter had the seafood chowder and she couldn't stop talking about how amazing it was.   Service was great and the price was reasonable.  I need to move to Edinburgh now.",

These \"Queen\" scallops were very tasty though somewhat on the small side -- only a small bit per scallop.    Wines seemed to be reasonably priced and the restaurant was clean and bright.",

Good enough to pre-book for my birthday though. Returning for my Birthday our party of seven where tightly squeezed into a corner seating area, but we set to ordering and enjoying the evening. I and another of our party ordered scallops as a main. The first bite for my guest was into a gritty scallop, so she called over the waitress who took it away and offered a replacement, which was declined. My first scallop was fine, but the next was gritty so I called over the waitress who whisked the dish away and came back with it a few minutes later. Apparently the kitchen said there was nothing wrong as I had already eaten one and that I was just copying the other member of our party. I demanded that whoever in the kitchen wasn't prepared to believe a customer when they complain should come out and discuss it in person and maybe try one. This failed to happen and when it came to paying the bill they insisted on charging for half the dish that I hadn't eaten. This was an atrocious way to treat customers and I will never go back or recommend it to anyone. Probably the worst service I have ever had.",
