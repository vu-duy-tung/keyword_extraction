    "text": "I love this little newly opened Spanish Tapas place on Dalry Road in Edinburgh.  It's a small place and some things still need improvement and development. The toilet is in the cellar and it's unisex. The owners are very lovely and accomodating. They made us feel very welcome.  You pay for what you get. The tapas are very tasty. Some say, too salty. But I liked it. Every bite of it. The meat is fresh and you can also buy the ham to take home. They don't have an alcohol license yet, so you should bring your own beverage. Just read the small print. 1 bottle is 5 and others 0.50 per bottle. If you stay there and have a proper meal, this charge can be discussed. We will be back",
