Clear chicken and beef soup with noodles followed by a marinated chicken breast & chips being a favourite of mine.   Be sure to check out the banoffee pie and/or carrot cake too!   I always go home feeling refreshed and stuffed to the seams, but NEVER ILL!.   A little gem in Gorgie, but don't take my word for it TRY IT!",

    "text": "Basically, the best place to eat on the west side of town. Don't let the journey put you off (it is the far end of Gorgie Road, along by McDonalds), as it is worth every minute you have to wait in the tram roadworks.   The pork collops in thyme and lemon sauce with cucumber in sour cream salad and potato dumplings and pork crackling (really pancetta) is to die for! It costs less than 6!! They have gorgeous soup, ciabbatta. side dishes, salads, desserts. You will not go wrong if you eat here. Expect t have a 20min approx wait, as everything is cooked to order.   This is a really small cafe, that can only seat 6 people. Don't worry if you can't get in, as they do take away as well (although not delivery).",

    "text": "This is an amazing place; set up by two very friendly individuals, Wojtek and Daniel - people who like to cook and eat, and only then make money, not the other way round. Food is splendid, and the coffee is good too. Make sure you'll check Maryjanna's cake and Viennese cheesecake. And of course Polish food! :) Pierogi are ace. Kleofas is one of my favourite places in Edinburgh, and not only because I live near by. It simply rocks.",

    "text": "This really is my favourite place to eat and relax in Edinburgh. Its cosy, friendly, small and the staff are really mellow and its just so different from anything else around. They are cheap and I mean really cheap and the food is just amazing. I come from Poland and its actually very rare to find a place where the food tastes like it does in Poland. My favourite disg is dumplings with cheese (pierogi) but really I tried most of their dishes and all are just amazing. Its real home made food. Try it, I highly reccommend it. See you at Kleofas:)",

    "text": "Fantastic cosy place. A real find, thanks to my pal for showing this to me. The guys are fantastic and so warm and freindly. Time is tight for me so they open early for me to have lunch. Most appreciated I can say. Makes working overtime a pleasure. The beef and noodle soup is fantastic and so are their cakes. Tried to coax the recipe to no avail, however Woytek gave me a cake mix from the deli next door and it was so easy to make and turned out fantastic. Hubby and kids thinks they have a new wife and mother, I bake a different cake every week now. Would visit all the time if I stayed locally. Have never seen such a winning combination. Great service, great food and the guys make you feel so special and important. No wonder the competition stoops to such levels. Could go on and on praising this place. Keep up the good work, will be in this week so looking forward to seeing you. x",

    "text": "Kleofas is my local Polish cafe and is the best place this side of Edinburgh. The two guys really know how to cook great food, (really nice guys too!) and the Banoffie Pie is THE BEST in the universe. I have been visiting since it opened a year ago and have never been disappointed, or ill!! Don't miss it!!   The boys from Kleo did our wedding buffet in June. The food was absolutely fantastic, extremely high quality, well presented and most importantly, delicious!!! I can't recommend them enough for any catering needs you may have.",

Drop in for a leisurely meal or just a coffee or hot chocolate with their cakes. I generally try not to eat at places close to home because I end up feeling like I have not been out to eat but Kleofas iis the only exception I make.",
