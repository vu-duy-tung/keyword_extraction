Eating it was a physical challenge which was a shame because it was so good when it finally engaged my taste buds. The service was so-so. I felt like the place was trying so hard to be hip that it was going to have an seizure. The details about it being very loud are not kidding. Do not go if you are looking for a quiet place to chat.",

    "text": "We had dinner at the outsider on a bit of a whim, not having been able to book any other nice restaurants on our only dinner night in edinburgh. We'd booked for 20:00, but showed up at 19:00 and they had a table for us. A lovely one, in the back, with a view of the castle. The menu is simple, and everything looks delicious. Every single dish i saw coming out of the kitchen, I wanted to taste. Everything we had tasted amazing. For the first time in my life, I left the potato skins on as I ate the hand-cut chips. The whipped cream that came with the chocolate cake was made with molasses. For the first time ever, I did not ignore the cream. I ate it. It, too, was delicious.   With a flagon of wine one entree to share, a main dish for each and a dessert to share, our bill came to about 60 for the both of us. Given how delicious the food was, we were ready to pay more.    The next day, as we chatted with our host back at the house we rented a room at for the night, we discovered that he and his staff all strongly recommended the outsider, and that another couple staying there had also dined there the night before, as happily as us.    I'm already looking forward to going back to the outsider for dinner. And I live a five-hour train ride away. Yes, it's that good.",

    "text": "One of my most favourite, favourite restaurants in Edinburgh. I can't even remember the amount of times I've been here, but I'm suspicious that they inject the beetroot coleslaw that comes with the chunky healthy lines dishes with some kind of addictive ingredient, that makes you desire pink strips of amazing coleslaw day and night. I'll be highly surprised if anybody else is weird enough to have beetroot coleslaw cravings, but there we go.   You can rely on several things about The Outsider. It's always busy, and therefore has a great atmosphere, the food is consistently tasty and brilliant, and it's effortlessly cool and style laden at all times. It's also reasonably priced, so you can have a few glasses of wine plus some food without worrying too much.   The Outsider always has a really good feel about it, and it has steadily remained popular over the years. I usually go for any of the chunky healthy lines, which are basically skewers speared with different food items, ranging from scallops, and salmon to lamb meatballs and chicken pieces. There are no official starters, as you're encouraged to share the CHLs, and there's a good variety of meat, seafood and veggie dishes on offer for main courses, and always served in pretty generous portions too.",

The warm and lively atmosphere was a welcome break from the snowstorm outside, and immediately I started to feel at home.  A glass (it was lunchtime, or obviously we would have ordered a bottle!) of very nice and reasonably-priced pinot grigio later and I was feeling even better.  As I scanned the menu, all the great memories started to come back: from the CHLs (Chunky Healthy Lines - usually a kebab type thing with pitta, vegetables and dressing) to the yummy fries.  I ordered the lamb and venison stew which was mouthwateringly good.  My companion had the ribeye steak, which although not my favourite cut, was well-cooked and juicy.  And when I got the bill (unfortunately I was the one paying), it was definitely not an unpleasant surprise.  Well worth it for the quality of food and service.  Highly recommend and wish I still lived in Edinburgh so I could go here more often.",

The Outsider seems to have the latter covered to a successful degree as the barnsley chops I tried, with a lovely goats cheese dauphinoise, was excellent. My opinion is admittedly complimented by a cracking view of Edinburgh castle available from the rear of the restaurant, making the whole experience unique to Edinburgh.  Worth a try.",

We sat for ten or fifteen minutes before anyone took our drink order, after which all staff refused to meet our eyes and only came by to curtly drop off our meal. I ordered the gnocchi, and the only flavour it had was burnt - aside from the black on the weird, overly doughy \"gnocchi\" the dish was completely tasteless . My mom had the crab linguini, which tasted like seaweed and old fish. Even the drinks were bad - the prosecco was ill chosen, the kir royale was too sweet. All of this would be forgivable is the service wasn't so terrible - we sat with mostly uneaten but obviously finished plates for a while before we decided to get up and leave. Nobody checked with us or said thank you as we quietly paid and left. Truly terrible, and I'm pretty forgiving as I worked in restaurants for years.",

Though a word of warning  the portions are MASSIVE so don't even think about ordering sides. We made the mistake of ordering olives and bread for two to nibble on first, and were bowled over by the size of the olives and how beautifully oaty the bread was, which came with a serving of pesto olive oil. By the time our pork belly and seafood CHL (satay sticks with seafood and vegetables, and a beetroot and apple coleslaw pitta) came we were almost full, but shovelled down the food like it was the last thing we'd ever eat  it was just too tasty not to. The garlicky fries were heaven too. I think the bill came to around 45 with a caraffe of wine as well, which was a very reasonable price considering the excellent night we had.

    "text": "After hearing so much about The Outsider I just had to give it a try, so when a special occasion popped up it was first on my list. We went for an early dinner, but the place was hopping when we arrived! The staff took our coats which we later saw was a fantastic way to keep the place looking chic. We were brought upstairs to a table which overlooked the downstairs of the restaurant, though lacked a castle view. You can't have everything!   Since we'd booked an early table the staff had asked we return it by a certain time so we decided to skip the starters for some bread. The artisanal bread was delicious though I wasn't fond of the butter, it tasted a bit on the rancid side. The accompanying parsley and oil dip was also enjoyable.   We ordered a merlot with whole partridge for me, served with black pudding, pear and crushed potatoes, while opposite me steak and chips was the call of the day. The partridge was delicious, and everything on the plate went together wonderfully. I probably won't be ordering 'whole' anything in a restaurant anytime soon as my attempts to carve it up were bordering on ridiculous. Meanwhile the steak, which had been ordered 'medium' arrived quite pink inside which was a disappointment but we decided not worth a complaint.   After we had demolished our dinners we settled on a dram of whisky and some rum truffles for afters. Unfortunately we are both quite picky about desserts and none of those available really appealed to us. The truffles were delicious and quite heavy. There were six or so on the dish and I think 2 or 3 would be sufficient for anyone.  The staff are wonderful, very professional and conscientious. And all very good looking, just saying. The look of the place is halfway between rustic and modern. Candlelight provides  a good bit of the lighting in some areas while spotlights take over in others. The chairs are chunky and wooden and the lack of coats everywhere definitely shows off the design. The wooden floors and large windows give a modern look. Huge windows downstairs, complete with mirrors upstairs afford many patrons with a wonderful view of the castle which is lit beautifully at night.  A great meal and definitely one for the list you have friends and family visiting, or just for a nice night out!",

We were put in the front in a comfy window booth. It felt private yet we still could see the rest of the restaurant. I think they have tables in the back with a spectacular view. Request one of those. I really enjoyed my mussel appetizer. My Pedro Ximeniez and dessert sampler were standouts as well. Eat here. You won't regret it.",

That said, you know he's still too cool to take any of this too seriously, and you love him for it. He's secretly laughing at the two serious-looking people in suits sitting over there, even though they just ordered the exact same cheese board that you did, because you guys are going to enjoy it so much more.  PROTIP: There is one perfect, lovely table on the second floor that faces a window which overlooks the castle. Try to reserve this table for the perfect experience. We had the one next to it which was still lovely.  [ vibe ] Proper enough to justify the menu prices without feeling overbearingly fancy. A suit wouldn't be out of place, but definitely not required. Romantic. Perfect for a date / night out, if you don't want to scare the girl with 40 entrees but want to show that you're still taking this seriously. Cozy, dark, chic, modern, while still feeling the rustic charm of Edinburgh.  [ food ] We started with the cheese board and wine. Good mix and serving sizes - brie, comte, and blue, with ample compote, grapes, and crackers. Can't remember what mains we ordered (there was some kind of sweet potato gnocchi in there). Not striking, but sufficiently delicious. You will walk out full.  [ value ] Two pound signs, but definitely a three pound sign vibe. Prices are more than reasonable for the service and quality of food that you get.  [ cherry on the cake ] I accidentally left my phone (with a Mondrian-themed case) in the bathroom - by the time I realized and called the restaurant it was already late and we had settled into bed, so the cheery gentleman on the phone said to just come back the next morning. \"Just say that Paul put it in the small safe, and name the artist who did the painting on the back\". Grabbed it the next day and had a nice chat. Lovely people.  [ conclusion ] A solid choice for a good night out, run by good human beings. Definitely give it a go the next time you feel like wining and dining.",

I came for lunch with a friend and ordered the rabbit pie and burger, respectively. Everything was new to me as it's my first time in Scotland, but the rabbit pie was very good and made me glad I tried it! My friends burger was also delicious, as was the bread we ordered on the side. The bread was accompanied by a green sauce that I really loved, but they didn't spill on the ingredients haha. Everything else on the menu and the other plates that fellow diners were having seemed great!",

    "text": "Tried The Outsider for lunch a couple of days ago, it's been on my list for a while and I was visiting Edinburgh for the day during the festival so had the perfect excuse.   We had a reservation and thank god we did because this place was mobbed! There was a wait time of 25 minutes when we showed up. We had requested a window seat because of the beautiful views of the castle, and having booked a week and a half before our visit I was sure we would have snagged one, but unfortunately not. Hopefully next time!   Really great menu variety, with a smaller portioned lunch section at great prices, and then a full al a carte menu also. I ended up going for the gnocchi with beets and goats cheese, and my boyfriend had  hake which was also served with gnocchi. The gnocchi wasn't the usual you could buy from the supermarket or are served at an average Italian joint, but instead they were like large potato dumplings. Really, really nice and not overly chewy like some gnocchi can be.   Great wine list, with superior wines at fab prices. We settled for a French Picpoul which I would definitely look for again.   We chose the rhubarb pannacotta for dessert which was okayish. Would choose something else next time. We tried to order a couple of Pedro Ximenez for an after dinner drink, which unfortunately they were out of but the waiter recommends a really delicious alternative.   I'll definitely return to the outsider another time, maybe when the festival is over and it's not so manic, but all in all a really great place.",

But with a bit of explanation I came to learn these were juicy, tender skewers of multiple varieties (I had the monkfish), accompanied by lovely sides (think sweet potato, pita with cabbage slaw, etc). Delightful, filling and...indeed, healthy!   Sides: roasted kale (with a kick, whew!) and the walnut apple salad (really nice).   The foggy mist created a \"ghost castle\" effect -- very beautiful view from the back of the restaurant's windows. The lighting and ambience are subtle, yet...perfect. Candlelit, clean rustic feel that is both contemporary and classic feeling at once. Comfortable. The din never too loud, but always cheerful. Tables turned all evening. The staff is gorgeous and competent.   Dessert: a fresh plum tart with spicy ginger ice cream. Heavenly   Not a missed step all evening, perhaps they could've upsold me another glass of Forge Mill rose (light and frivolous was the description -- indeed!) had they asked --- but this only allowed me to save room for an espresso martini, which propelled me through the rest of the evening, night and into the morning...as it turns out!   Will surely return when in the area -- a real treat.",

And the waiter and manager were both great, charming but cool. It was great for lunch with my family but would also be a great date night spot too.

The food was excellent (got the venison haunch which was melt-in-the-mouth and a delicious frangipane-based pudding), the wine was good too.  They didn't rush us when we lingered after dinner to finish our second bottle of wine, but then it was January and the middle of the week so the place wasn't exactly packed!  The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because I've only had one meal there, and I was with a regular. But a very happy surprise I have to admit!  Highly recommended.",

After plopping down a jug of water, our waiter disappeared for 15 minutes and since we sitting around a corner I decided to get up and notify the maitre'd that we were ready to order.  Judging by how long it took us to put in our order, we requested our starter and mains be brought out together so as not to make an even bigger production out of dinner. After 45 minutes and witnessing a table who arrived after us receive their starters, we asked for the bill bc we were fed up. The waiter agrees to bring the check but after a few minutes comes up to notify us the food will be ready shortly and has the gall to stand at our table and quibble over the length of time we have waited!!! He argued it was 40 minutes of waiting rather than the 1hr we claimed (15 minutes to place an order + 45 minutes waiting for food)!!  After holding us captive for 1 hr in wait of our food, the maitre'd comes up with plates in hand as the waiter is debating wait time with us and says \"oh ladies, what are we to do with all this food? It's up to you - you eat it or not.  The food takes time, we make it fresh...\" blah blah blah - as if to insinuate we needed an education on fine dining. Let's not delude ourselves here - by no stretch of the imagination is this a fine dining establishment.  Admit someone fked up, or something went wrong, apologise and do better. Fine, we chose to eat it as it was already close to 9pm.  Why was this \"freshly\" made food luke warm??!    Now for the food - meh. My reaction is probably coloured by the tense atmosphere created in having to fight with the staff. Ox cheek starter - interesting, never had it with beans before. Gnocchi - I missed that it was described as \"pan fried\" so was not expecting little sticks of dry gnocchi with walnuts and pears.  The combination of ingredients contained a bit more salt than I'd prefer to eat, but it was tasty. Having just been to Tuscany a week ago, it would be a bit unfair to compare it to the pillowy soft texture of Italian gnocchi  Lamb rump - apart from it being luke warm, mum said it was fine.   We did finish all of our food though, and it was OK but I probably would've said the same for any food at that point.  Would I ever go back - not a chance in hell!  Thankfully, we were not charged service or I really would have lost the plot.",

The place is very modern, but with a classy warm look to it.  We were sat in a corner window seat which was fine because it drowned out the noise from the rest of the restaurant.  Our server was a young lady and she was helpfully in picking our food and making suggestions.  The food was very good, the wife ordered the lamb which was almost as amazing as our recent Indian restaurant and I ordered the steak, which also was very good.   Overall the dining experience was very good until the end.  We had arrived there about 1.5 hour from them closing.  Our waitress had completely disappeared and I had finished all of my water and my drink.  Since I noticed we had another 20 minutes I had wanted another glass of wine, but no one wanted to come over.  I grab the attention of another waiter cleaning the place up and he came over to assist. Let me tell you there were still about 6 people in the place with no signs of them leaving at all.  Being that it was 5 minutes before the closed ( I waited 15 minutes to get someone's attention) I just asked for the check and inquired on our waitress.  The waiter said she went home, but told him to take care of us; then why did no one come and check on us. Overall the food was very good, the prices were good, and the serve right up to the end was above average.  I would have rated them 4 stars with no problem had someone been around to assist us at the end of the meal.",

With building suspense, I visited the Outsider for the first time tonight with my boyfriend and my parents, and it fully lived up to my expectations!   I had the grilled monkfish skewers with rolled bacon and grape tomatoes, with salad and a fantastic beetroot coleslaw (I'm not usually a slaw person but this was amazing). My mother's salmon was perfect and plentiful, grilled with sweet beetroot and piled high with a salad. My boyfriend liked his porkbelly with scallops, and my father liked his mackerel (although the mackerel was a bit of a small portion compared to the other dishes, we had more than enough food with plenty of salmon and monkfish). We had a candle-lit table by the window with fantastic views of the castle and a lovely dinner together here!  Although a treat and a bit more expensive than I would spend on everyday meals, they were absolutely delicious and also had great lunch / early evening deals (6.50) lasting until 7pm for those with tighter budgets.",

Venison was cooked to perfection, served with roasted veggies and a carrot puree which I wish there had been more of it was so good. Started with the braised ox cheek and knew right away we had chosen wisely. Soft, succulent and full of flavor. Large portion for a starter, too. Skewered spiced lamb balls with merguez were spicy and smokey. Portion was twice what we were expecting, but we finished it all because we simply couldn't bear to leave any behind. Good wine list, lovely modern space with big windows and clean lines. Right on a main street, but when you step in it has an intimate feel despite being a larger restaurant. Two glasses of wine, a beer, two appetizers, and two entrees, along a side totaled $75 US. Great value for the caliber of the food. Excellent spot for a romantic dinner.",

The place was very busy for lunch but still quick to seat us and quick to get our orders. It was crowded but still gave each table a sense of intimacy so you didn't feel like you were eating lunch with the people sitting next to you. The decor was very modern Scottish with wool lined booths, unfinished wooden chairs, and modern wooden art. Our server was helpful with the menu and questions we had regarding the days specials. The food was delicious. It was the first restaurant we visited in this city that seasoned each dish perfectly! I had the open faced venison sandwich. The meat was perfectly cooked and seasoned and the bread was chewy and crusty despite multiple sauces on and around it. The salad with my entree actually had a seasoned dressing drizzled on it (another first for this city which had a habit of service a side of greens with nothing else). If we ever make it back to this city, this restaurant will be one we frequent.",

The blackboard specials looked promising and the prices did too with many dishes priced between 6.80 and 8.00 at lunchtime.  I had hoped to get a table with a view over to the castle as I had my mum visiting but we had a table at the front which turned out to be fab! The window seats are uber comfortable with masses of pillows.  I had the mussels in a cream sauce with parmesan, bacon and onion and for a nice change they came with chips instead of bread. My mum (it was girly Jubilee weekend) had the pork belly in a red wine gravy with sweet potatoes and she said it was fabulous (I didn't try as I'm Gluten Free and wasn't sure it was safe).  Both were huge portions and we both loved our dishes. There were tons of mussels (only a couple closed) and the pail of chips seemed endless but fab with just the right amount of crispiness and some garlicky salt seasoning.  The Outsider was very busy - staff were friendly and seemed to cope. I would definitely return for dinner as the food is fab and drinks are reasonable (4 a glass if wine, 2.50 for coke) but this is a great place for a post museum lunch!",

    "text": "One very late dinner ago, we stumbled upon this locale.   My anxiety of not having a proper dine that night, soon enough fluttered away.   The menu while not an extensive one, touched upon a good range of dishes. We wined and dined on steak & lobsters that night, with a birds eye view of the castle's luminance.  There were just two other tables that Friday night for dinner at 11.  Perfectly intimate.   That was our first night out in Edinburgh, a day after moving here.  I remembered my lobster was just right, the steak was beautifully under, the wine mingled with every sensory jive.  But not the name.    A night out for drinks and a spontaneous call for dinner this past Saturday, had us landing at a place called The Outsider.  Good ratings, food pics-check, okay we'll give it a go.  Soon as we arrived at the entrance, I was ecstatic when I realised where we were.  Dinner at 9:30 meant the place was bustling and we had to wait a good deal for our food to arrive.  But service was efficient and friendly.  Baked sea bream spiced with greens & truffle oil was delicate yet distinctly robust in flavour.  The ribeye was just gone too fast, the wine was good enough for another round, and still the same beautiful view remained.  2/2 was a hit.  I would happily return for a lovely dinner in candlelit ambiance.  Given the view, quality of food, wine list, service, I give it a solid 4 stars.",

But The Outsider looked too good to resist with its super cool, artsy interior and packed out restaurant. It also has such a reasonably priced lunch menu. We were welcomed warmly by the manager, which seems to be procedure as, whilst there were other waiters free, the manager made it his point to come and greet us. - A nice touch! Service was great from start to finish.  I had the venison with garlicky fries which made for such a satisfying combination. Those garlicky fries are a dream, they really are; so full of flavour and a mighty generous portion. The quality of meat was high and the venison dressing was a tangy, delicious one. The meat came on a thick crispy baguette and also with a side salad. - This was a really impressive and cheap lunch that had me excited to see just what else The Outsider has up its sleeve!  I think that my next visit will be for a special occasion and I've no doubts that they'll impress.",

First look it's dim (can't read the menu in candle light) but the menu looks interesting. We booked a slot and came back. An hour into the meal, the restaurant is full. Mostly locals. Good sign. We ordered the appetizer which came with a skewer of sorts and salad. I ordered a seafood stew (yum) and my partner ordered the fish. All good. We came back the next evening to try the other specials. Service was attentive and waiter have good recommendations for dessert. Seating is tight and can get noisy if you want a private conversation. In colder nights they will insist that they take your coats although some diners have theirs hung on their chairs. It's not strictly enforced. With the flickering candle lights on the table, checking your coats is a precaution.  Get a seat by the window for the view of the castle. It's very relaxing if you come in early to enjoy the twilight over a vino.",

The younger waiter helped me think starter and dessert through.  The older waiter was snooty with me when asking about the pinot noir...\"Of course it's good! \" Then, the hot dishes were rather cold... not cool! Dessert is fine.

    "text": "The Outsider is a place that you plan to go to, not simply walk by and stop in. And this is for good reason. The food is excellent. This was the second lunch here for my wife and me. Our first time we had just walked in, and had to wait a bit for a table. This time we took the wisdom to phone ahead for a reservation.   As you'll read in many of the reviews, The Outsider is a modern restaurant with chic interior and great views of the castle and the Old Town. This contrast in decor and the historical surroundings gives you a feeling almost as if you have travelled from a medieval city into a cosmopolitan restaurant of the future. However, while many of the 'restaurants' within a stone's throw of the castle serve up steak pie, balmoral chicken and fish and chips (all of which I love at the appropriate time), The Outsider focuses more on a Renaissance of the taste buds rather than traditional Scottish fare.   The wife and I have been highly attracted to the lunch menu prices. A meal and a drink for two would only just push you over the 20 mark. In fact, without drinks, you can eat for just under 15, even with a starter. And when you compare that to other restaurants considered to be more affordable at lunch time, then I think I'll pay a 1 or 2 quid more and have a much better meal.   Each time we have been here the restaurant has 3 specials served 12-7pm added onto the regular lunch menu served 12-5pm. My philosophy is that if one of the specials appears rather appealing, then I'll have that and try a regular menu choice later. I did that again this time and  the duck special with Parmesan mash potatoes, purple broccoli and black pudding, drizzled in a very tasty sort of creamy raspberry sauce. It was really good. If I was a better writer I would describe it in bigger words ;)   While I would say that the food and decor were excellent, I was slightly less impressed with the service, and I do mean ever so slightly. The staff are very friendly, don't get me wrong. The two times I have been here we have had servers who spoke fluent english, but, however, they had problems explaining what things were on the menu. In fact our most recent server had to go ask what some of the items were on the regular menu. I feel like any staff at a restaurant should be able to describe and explain exactly what a dish is and what is in it.   If you're planning an afternoon in Edinburgh, then you should definitely stop here for lunch, especially instead of any of the other well spoken of restaurants even on the same street.",

The one thing that I really liked about this restaurant was the extremely comfortable booth. I think I could fall asleep amongst those pillows. Also kudos for using actual stick candles. As for the food, the portions were big, but the combination of flavors were confusing and all over the place.   For starters, we had the slow roasted pork belly, dauphinoise potatoes, buttered greens, and shallot gravy. It was better than my main course, which was a pan roasted cod fillet with salmon, chilli and coriander potato cake and a mussel salsa. The cake was very grainy and the cod was completely dried out and lacked acidity. It was one of the few times when I left food on the plate. One highlight from dinner was the olive oil that accompanied the bread.   I haven't tried much modern European cuisine, but if The Outsider was a good example, I don't think I am a fan.",

It's stylish inside - chic yet welcoming, with a very cosy looking alcove for super-intimate celebrations. My friend and I came here on a special occasion and were delighted to be seated next to the window, looking directly across the rooftops of Edinburgh and onto the castle. The views only got more gorgeous as the sun went down.  Last time I was here a while ago, I ordered the gnocchi, then told my waiter I might go with the risotto instead. He confided that he thought I'd be better off sticking with the gnocchi, in his opinion. (I love it when wait-staff are happy to advise on the food!) Well, this time I bravely sallied forth and had the risotto, for comparison. The gnocchi had been delicious, but the red pepper and walnut risotto was actually more to my taste! Perhaps it was a little more punchy and obvious in the flavour, but that's right up my street, and the texture was perfect.  Our desserts had just arrived - plum tarte tatin with vanilla creme anglaise and ginger ice cream for my friend, vanilla and raspberry pannacotta with pistachio biscotti for me - when I blinked and everything got darker. Oh no! A power cut!  Actually, it was sort of lovely to have a candlelit dinner and the restaurant looked stunning in the low light. However, we'd been there since six o'clock. The poor people who had only arrived for 7 or 7:30 were shortly to be informed that no more food could be served.  The waiting staff immediately set about the task. Our waitress had been a cheery delight right from the off - we'd commented to each other on it right away - and now was exactly the same as she went around each of her tables in turn, explaining the situation apologetically and totting up bills with her iPhone. Almost everybody responded with equal warmth and moved on perfectly happily. I do hope nobody was unkind to the staff since it wasn't their fault at all.  She came to us last, which we were perfectly fine with, since we'd been fortunate enough to actually have our full meal (at one point I heard her say to a table she'd just dealt with, \"Now then, where shall I go next? Who looks angriest?\"). To our amazement, despite what must have been a nightmare evening for her, she'd also remembered everything we'd had. She even knocked our teas off the bill as an apology for the circumstances - which was lovely, although not necessary. My friend summed it up as we left: \"I don't think I've had such a fun night in ages!\"  So if you go to The Outsider, obviously you can't expect a power cut. But you can expect obscenely good food, a beautiful setting, and superhero service from start to finish regardless of the situation.",

Although I've only eaten here once, I'd definitely go back when finance allows.  The outside of this establishment says cool and stylish.  The inside matches this, and does not disappoint.  This was the first ever place where I was given some bread and that oil/balsamic vinegar mixture to dip it in.  I was slightly confused to have been given something that I had not ordered, but I was glad to discover that it was complimentary.  I had the steak as a main course, which was brought out very swiftly, and was very tasty.  The restaurant was quite busy when I was there, and so it's perhaps not the place to go if you're looking for a quiet romantic meal.  That said, I did not feel lost in a sea of other customers, and was efficiently taken care of throughout the course of my meal.  The Outsider provided me with a meal that I still remember, and that shows how much I enjoyed it.  This is not a regular occurrence for a restaurant.  I have recommended it to a number of friends, and I look forward to my next visit!",

    "text": "I've walked past this place loads of times, and yet never felt the urge to wander in and try it. It always just looks a bit too \"style over substance\", as if there's not much to it aside from a slightly pretentious-sounding menu.  Today, however, I was proven wrong. I went for lunch with some friends after finishing our exams, and I was really impressed. The food was gorgeous, and surprisingly good value for money. I had a smoked trout salad on a bed of mixed leaves, with a mango and yoghurt dressing, whilst my friends had the home-made chilli burger with garlic fries. It was all really well-made, and really nicely presented too.  That said, the waitress did do the one thing that is a pet hate of mine in restaurants - she started clearing the plates away before half of us had even finished. I'm the first to admit that I'm a bit obsessive about manners when it comes to food, but it still got on my nerves.  Apart from that though, I was pleasantly surprised and I will definitely be going back.",

    "text": "Before I actually came here,  I was told it's one of those arty new restaurants, with minimalist decoration, and apparently the owner didn't approve of people hanging their coats on the back of the chairs and they were quickly taken to the cloak cupboards.   So walking in I was expecting a \"too-cool-for-you attitude\" How wrong I was.  The menu is interesting (for a change), and it gets a revamp seasonally. I had the pigeon dish (can't remember what it's actually called but chose it mostly because it had a warning about containing gunshot) and on a different occasion had a kebab dish- both delicious! They have platters to share as well. The cheese selection is decent and their homemade bread is too moreish.  The interior is mostly dark. However, this doesn't make it a dark place, instead, the glorious view from the enormous windows of the lit-up Castle outside.  The service is layed back and chilled but efficient and professional at the same time. On both occasions I had dinner there with my family our waitress (a different girl each time) was lovely and very friendly. And they didn't take our coats (they offered but it was not compulsory). Only thing I can hold against it is the noise level gets really bad because the ceilings are so high- at times it gets hard to talk at a normal volume.Also, it is a bit pricey but the portions are huge,the quality is great and they have a great lunch deal. It's cheaper (about 6-10 pounds for a main at lunch and about 9-15 pounds for a dinner if you skip out on drinks/starters/dessert so not too bad for a proper restaurant) .  To sum up I absolutely love this slightly different restaurant and it's ideal for a special occasion or to just treat yourself and your friends/date.",

The staff were friendly and efficient. The starters, mains and dessert were all delicious. I particularly enjoyed the polenta and rosemary biscuit that came with the poached pear and chocolate pot. The guinea fowl was lovely and tender and the chorizo and squid salad had a nice flavour. There was no loud obnoxious music and although the tables were quite close together, the high ceilings made it feel spacious and not claustrophobic. Good value for money. Would definitely go again.",

They have a nice, reasonably-priced wine list too.  I was put off by having to pay for an order of bread -- that's unheard of to an American -- but when it came I forgot about the piddling 1.30 or however much it was, because the bread was amazing. As was the olive oil they served with it. Really, really nice stuff.  Both of the mains my husband and I ordered were really delicious -- duck for me, pheasant for him -- but I would have liked a bit more mash and greens to round out the meal. I felt a bit hungry as we left. I don't think I'm greedy, I just eat a lot! We probably should have ordered appetizers but I didn't think we would need to, and I didn't want to drop 5 on an unimpressive dessert menu.  Overall -- a great place to take a date, with creative and tasty food.",

I begged the manager for a window-seat, claiming everything from far-sightedness, to parents-in-town, and managed to get it!  Let me tell you, sitting at the window at night overlooking the castle is a pretty damn cool way to convince your parents that you've picked the right city to live in.   Now, about the food: I had the salmon-beetroot salad and fries, and man, was it delicious. I don't know how they did it, but they'd infused the salmon with beetroots somehow, I forgot to ask, but it was the most delicious salmon salad I've ever had in my life. And that's saying a lot, since I used to live in Santa Monica, and Seattle (both having easy access to vast quantities of this delicous fishy). They combined it with watermelon, spinach, and various greens and it was just to-die-for. I know that both my parents enjoyed their meals so much that their plates were absolutely cleaned out.   Not only are these rather reasonable prices (mains from 11.00-19.00 pounds) the quality that you get for this price is absolutely insane. I'd definitely recommend this for a visit and I'm coming back again soon!",

The portion wasn't too big and my date had the poussin and it was a very large portion, very tasty as well. First time I've ever had these dishes and I liked them both.

The food was quite good--we both ordered the skirt steak.  The problem was that we ordered medium rare, and one was bright purple, while the other was slightly more cooked.  We decided they should be sent back to be heated a bit.  They basically threw both back in for the same amount of time, and they came back half the size and one was medium and the other was medium-well.  I'm typically not very picky and I don't think I've sent any food back in about 15 years.  I ate the overcooked meat and my girlfriend shared her slightly-less-cooked piece with me.    It was very tasty, and I assume the cooking issue was a one-off mistake rather than a reflection on the restaurant.  But I certainly can't give this place too high of a reco.  I did like the service a lot, and felt good when the waiter confirmed that our steaks did indeed look undercooked by stating \"that's not rare...that's blue!\"  Our appetizers were good and the bread was tasty I think.",

The restaurant's ambience is very nice and lively. We were seated near the front door but I noticed that the better view is all the way in the back where you have a better view.  I noticed that the servers were all very busy and always in a hurry. I should have picked up on it that service will be very slow. And it was. It took awhile for our food to come out. We were going to order dessert and asked our waitress to bring us the menu. We waited and waited and didn't get the menu. So we just decided to ask for our bill so we can pay and get out of there.  The food was not good. My boyfriend ordered the skirt steak and I had the pork belly with scallops. There was hardly any flavor in both. The quality of the meat used in the skirt steak was poor. We found much better restaurants in the area.",

    "text": "I'm sorry, but this place was not as good as it seems some people say it is. Good points are, food was good and there is quite a good view of Edinburgh Castle if you are seated near the back of the restaurant. That's it, I'm afraid, for the good points.  First of all, if you're looking for the place on a recommendation, you might find it difficult to spot. The front of the place is pretty much lacking in any noticeable signage. If you look closely, and I did, but still had to have the name pointed out to me: there are two columns of wooden tiles between the windows, and on them are dark letters spelling out the word OUTSIDER. Other than that, you'd be excused for thinking that the place was going through a renovation or something.   Inside is very light and roomy and the tables seem to be randomly placed between all the wall tables and booths. The manager that meets you at the door seems to have his head somewhere in the profit books as he shows you to a table, you know, just not quite giving you all his attention. He also looked like he'd slept in, with his hair dishevelled and chin unshaven. The grandpa shirt tops of the look of art student in fourth year at art school.  Once seated you are handed a photocopy of a menu. Not a bad idea if you update your menu everyday, but, some ink in the photocopier would be a good idea too. I have good eyesight, but half the menu was totally illegible to me. Most of the menu was in a small type but there was something handwritten at the top. This was totally unreadable.  I managed to find something that sounded nice so I ordered it and it was very well cooked and tasty.  It wasn't a huge portion but it was charged as a full meal.  I have given two stars, one for the food and one for the castle view.",

    "text": "It's hard finding tasty and good value for money in Edinburgh when it comes to the food scene cause there's so many great restaurants in this city, but I have to admit this is one of them. In what ever city I live in, I always have at least one go to restaurant that I know won't fail me...in terms of flavour, cost, service, ambience, and most importantly filling me up.   This trendy restaurant with one of the best views of Edinburgh castle fit that bill and have yet to disappoint me (hopefully it will never, fingers cross). I tried the majority of their main meat dishes in my past visit so I decided to explore their fish mains. I've always wanted to try their fish stew which was filled with hake, clams, mussels, shrimp, and salmon. On a cold windy night, this dish certainly was the perfect choice so I selected it as my main. I skipped the first course cause I wanted to save room for dessert.   The dish came out on a wooden cutting board with salad and bread on the side. This bowl of fish stew was massive! The smell of the broth had remnants of the sea and the vision of the dish in a darkly lit room by the candlelight deserved an applause. The stew was piping hot and the flavours was a well blended symphony of the fish and shellfish. There was a healthy serving of fish (hake and salmon) as well as the clams. Two slight negatives about this dish though:   #1. It only had 1 shrimp  #2. While the flavour of the broth was amazing, I thought it needed a dash of salt to really round out the flavour of the dish. If it wasn't for those two things, I would say this was a home run kind of dish! Almost forgot to mention, but this dish was around 16!   For the dessert, I ordered chocolate and espresso pave with molasses ice cream. This was pure orgasm in my mouth. The ganache made from the chocolate and espresso was a perfect match and the espresso elevated the flavour of the chocolate. The ice cream complimented the richness and slight bitterness of the chocolate and espresso pave while the crunchy bits and shavings of chocolate  introduced texture. Absolutely perfect dessert if you're a chocoholic and definitely worth the 5.40!   The servers were great and attentive. They knew the dishes since I asked what some were and they came by our table just at the right moments to make sure we were doing ok. These servers motivate me to give them tip, no need to ask me twice!   The ambience in this place is awesome. I like the trendiness of the decor, the big windows, and candlelit tables.   The one thing I like about this place is I can depend on it and I know it'll deliver, just like a good friend. The only thing I would want them to do is change their menu maybe at least every 6 months, because while what they are making is great... I'm sure they would be an even more of an amazing restaurant if they took risks and introduced new dishes on a regular basis.",

    "text": "Went here for lunch. If you go, I would highly recommend asking for a seat facing Edinburgh Castle. There is an upstairs too that would be great. The atmosphere is excellent for a great lunch.  We went and the service was a little disjointed. The restaurant was not too crowded and we were sat and drinks and even food ordered with a girl we thought was our waitress. Then we needed drinks refreshed and our girl was there, but didn't come back over. The table next to us had another waitress so we politely asked her for some more water. She got us water. That girl and a man I assume was the manager brought us our food. The dishes are very beautifully plated. I ordered venison with rarebit. I thought it was under all the veggies, but upon my first bite, I noted there was no venison, but instead there was fish. I then tried to get everyone's attention including the three different people who had been to my table. It was not until I walked up to the manager at the bar that I got my attention due to my dish being wrong. The second girl then got my correct dish. They apologized, but then continued to ignore us after. I was not impressed with that.  That said, my venison and rarebit was decent. Price point was good. I think this was just a case of me finding a place on good reviews and hoping everyone was correct. :-/",

I enjoyed the seared venison salad. The meat was seasoned and prepared perfectly rare. It was served on a bed of greens with roast potato, apples and beets. They left off the blood pudding as it contains gluten.   The wine list is described in a way that makes you want to order a glass of each. Non-alcoholic fresh presses and cordials are also available. We didn't have room to indulge in dessert, but the selection sounded amazing.",

Upon being seated, we were given a list of 4 dishes that were unavailable as they'd run out, and also told they'd run out of bread, which seemed odd.   Nonetheless, once we made our selections, both meals were well presented, of a good size, and most importantly, fresh & delicious!   Good wine selection (though again, our waiter brought our bottle out with a light-hearted comment about not enjoying it too much, as it was the last one of that sort in stock), and while we passed on dessert, being too full to eat it, the options available looked great.",

I ended up eating their roast venison per the waiter's suggestion and this dish was paired alongside red braised cabbage, parsnips, thinly sliced and crisped ham on top a heavenly broccoli puree. The roast venison cooked medium rare was red, meaty and so tender and honestly one of the best meals I've had while in Europe. Friends of mine ate the mussels in the wine sauce and got hefty helpings that had them slurping and dipping bread over glasses of wine. Great night and atmosphere",

Excellent!  This is a nice place for a leisurely dinner, but it would be nicer if it was a bit quieter. We were a party of four middle-aged people and we kept asking each other \"what?\"",

I tried the lamb and my boyfriend had the ribeye and both were mouth wateringly good. Loved it!

We ordered a bottle of rose, appetizers (salads, dill potatoes, sweet potatoes, bread), main dishes (lamb dish with haggis, fried gnocchi (with walnuts, arugula, a little bit of pesto), Tagliatelle pasta (with pickled artichoke hearts, olives, capers, arugula, sun dried tomatoes, goat cheese), and for dessert we shared a baked pear with a scoop of ice cream, and truffles.  I enjoyed the sweet potatoes and the bread with the very yummy olive oil. My husband review of the lamb dish was very meaty. My stepdaughter ordered the fried gnocchi and she said it was alright. My tagliatelle pasta was okay. It was very tart-y because of the pickled artichokes, olives, capers and sun dried tomatoes. Those ingredients did not compliment the tagliatelle pasta at all. Even though there was goat cheese in it, it wasn't enough to balance the tartness of the dish. Made me do the pucker face a lot!  Haha!  The dessert was really good. I enjoyed the baked pear with ice cream more than the truffles. The ambiance was warm - dimmed light and woodsy. I wasn't wowed with the food, so I'm not sure if I'll go back there again next time I visit Edinburgh. I can at least cross it off the 10 things to do in Edinburgh!",

The first time, it was during the Fringe Festival.  I came in at 12noon when it opened, but the service was extremely hurried and the food came out extremely quick.  It is the fringe after all.  I was given the table only for a set amount of time and the food seemed prepared well in advanced.  I was not impressed.  I decided to forget about it and just thought it might well be due to the fringe and fair enough all restaurants in Edinburgh will want to have a high turnover to make full use of the month of tourist.    Fast forward 1 year later, I decided to give it another try outside of the Fringe festival.  Less hurried service obviously.  However, the food still did not impress me at all.  Yes, it has a good location and good window seats.  But that is about it.  The food did not provide enough punch to my tastebuds.  I had the mussels and lamb for the main course.  The mussels were ordinary and the lamb was a bit overcooked and was slightly tough.  Perhaps it was not the best cut and it was not cooked pink.  I will come back for special occasion with friends but unsure if I will suggest this myself.  Not bad but not a place I would come myself.",

    "text": "The Outsider was an outlier during my Scotland trip for a number of reasons, primarily, it's waitstaff who took advantage of our tourist status. They were disappointing in a number of ways including:  1. ADDING AUTOMATIC GRATUITY to the bill-- I'm American, and no stranger to tipping, but have not encountered this experience *anywhere* else in Scotland. Only at The Outsider 2. REFUSAL to allow patrons to taste the wine that they ordered in a bottle.  I asked and the answer I got was \"no, we don't do that here.\" A common practice in almost every restaurant that I've been to when ordering wine by the bottle is for the wait staff to show you the vintage (to assure you that they've acquired the right wine), uncork the wine and then pour a small bit to allow you to taste the wine in case it went bad from the corkage. This is a common practice from the most mom and pop at the ends of the Earth to the double Michelin star in the most cosmopolitan of places. 3. SELF SERVICE is expected. Again, after just uncorking the bottle of wine, the waitress left the bottle and presumably, we poured our wine ourselves from the bottle. It's not that we can't do it, but we can also serve our own food, bus our own table and hunt down our own animals. But I'm paying for my food and ambiance and apparently the automatic gratuity so I have expectations of service. 3. RUDENESS. At some point, the candle at our table had melted down into a nub, and we'd ask for a replacement candle lest the table catch on fire. The waitress, just decided to come over and blow it out. LOL. Thank you, why we couldn't have done that ourselves.   4. Food itself was....unspectacular. Exactly what you'd expect from a mid-tier restaurant--nothing innovative enough to outshadow the terrible service (only reason this place go 2 stars vs 1 star).There was a feeling that the wait staff couldn't wait to get make you miserable, so that you'll eat the food faster (after they charge you a gratuity of 12%! in a country where people don't usually tip that much, and only then I heard 10%+ is reserved for amazing service!)",

We wanted to try The Outsider earlier this week, but had a heck of a time finding it. Today was easy and we were lucky to grab dinner, walking in at 7:30.  They take reservations and you might to do that on the weekend evening.   We had the venison, the lamb and the hake. All were very good. Nothing over- nor under-cooked. Spiced well, but mild.  We finished with deserts, including rhubarb, chocolate & espresso pane, and baked pear. The pear was really flavorful. The Pane was a big portion but really not too rich and the molasses ice cream was not strong at all. The rhubarb was very mild compared to the rhubarb we have in the US, which tends to be really tart.   With a bottle of wine, the meal, a single side salad, and 3 coffees, the total was 128.  Really great consider the great food.",

The view is amazing, you can see the castle and graveyard as you enjoy your wonderfully witty wine (whoever wrote the wine menu has a great appreciation for wine and the comedy).

The Outsider both defied and exceeded expectations: a progressive, sleek restaurant which, on a Saturday night, welcomed families, dates, and the cool set alike.  Same-day reservations while I was still jet lagged were a cinch. They took our coats and led us to a nice table for two. The meal started with some truly delicious crusty artisan bread. I could have eaten the bread for the next hour and a half and gone home happy.   The waiter recommended a couple of outstanding appetizers (wish I could remember what they were, alas..methinks it was the goat cheese and chargrilled squid salad). Then I proceeded to devour my venison haunch, which was presented on a bed of malted barley, foraged mushrooms, wild leeks, and orange jus.  The staff was extremely friendly and engaged after I expressed enthusiasm for the cuisine and told them this was my first proper Scottish meal. They gave me travel and eating pointers and seemed genuinely happy that we enjoyed the meal. Truly, one of the most memorable meals in recent memory.",

The Venison is the best I've ever had, not a gamy aftertaste at all, instead it's all citrus flavors which calm everything down.   The lamb rump is equally as good and soft.

But tonight - even though we were hungry and the menu looked as tempting as ever - we had to walk out a few moments after sitting down.  So what's the problem?  Well, it's the manager, or whatever the man seating people tonight was called. I fear the numerous one star reviews he seems to have personally already earned this restaurant on other websites have gone to his head. How else to explain his attitude, which was inexplicably pitched somewhere between disdain and contempt?   Edinburgh has lots of terrific restaurants where you will be made to feel welcome, so - unless you actually enjoy dining on your own self respect - avoid The Outsider and go to one of those instead.  We did, and were very glad of it.",

    "text": "If you are over 40, you might find yourself unwanted in The Outsider.  My wife and I, both in our 60s and silvery, dined at \"The Outsider\" on the recommendation of our adult children, who enjoyed it.  Our experience was not positive.  The host -- who took forever to acknowledge our presence at the front door -- walked up to us and grabbed two menus without saying a word.  My wife said, \"two,\" indicating there were two of us for dinner.  He stood silently for a moment, then stated derisively, \"I was expecting a sentence.\"  After we seated the waitress asked what we would like to drink.  Since it was unseasonably warm, I asked if they had iced tea.  \"We have tea,\" she replied dismissively, \"but we don't put ice in it.\"  Fair enough.  I said I would have water with dinner.  Apparently, they don't put ice in water, either.  Or refill it.  All I had to drink the entire meal was a small glass of room-temperature water.  My wife ordered a Blue Moon Ale and that's all she had.  The waitress, after taking our order, never returned to our table to ask if we needed anything (like beverages).  In fact, she never spoke to us again, although she should care of younger diners.  Another employer dropped off our entrees wordlessly, not asking if we wanted anything else (like beverages).  Basically, we were ignored and treated rudely while the young wait staff doted on younger patrons.  Bear in mind that we were always polite and courteous and did nothing to inspire the rude and neglectful service we received.  The food was okay but not remarkable.  However, the service was abysmal.  The message was clear:  if you are not young, you are not wanted at The Outsider.  Elderly patrons are, ironically, \"outsiders\" at The Outsider.  If you're under 40 it's probably a good option.  If you're older, stay away.  They clearly don't want your business.",

It has great views of the castle and the interior is very cosy and funky. The food is gorgeous and reasonably priced, particularly the lunch menu where mains are 6-10. I would recommend a chilli burger which comes with garlic fries - delicious! They also do some more unusual main courses with many dishes made to share. I also thought the wine list was great with a choice for every budget. Like other reviewers I think the service could be more attentive and you are often left to your own devices for lengthy periods before you order. That's fine if you are out for a gossip with the girls but not great if you are hungry!",

We ate our way very slowly through our lunch as we chatted too much, and we were constantly interupted by staff asking if we needed anything, if we were finished. It became rather annoying. It was getting late, we had pudding and were deciding whether or not we should go somewhere else for a drink, we then opted for another bottle of wine at the restaurant. Again, every few mintues we were asked if we needed anything and we kept saying no. Then the waitress suddenly came and told us to leave and that we had been there long enough!!!! I was shocked at the tone and asked to see the manager who was even ruder!! He slouched over our table and told us that we had leave, we mentioned the fact that we had just ordered a bottle of win and his reply was that he could empty our glasses in the bottle and we could take it with us! We argued the fact that if they had wanted us to leave, then they should have told us before we ordered more wine. We were eventually given another table at the door, where we chatted more and then after about 20 minutes were told that enough was enough and we were to leave. We had spent about 70 there and were appalled at the behaviour of the staff. I will never be back and have to say the food portions in comparision to price was rather poor too. The manager's name was Matthew Kelly, and he really thought himself as something. Very, very poor show and an appalling way to treat paying customers!",

    "text": "First time in Scotland and the UK, saw the ratings on yelp and google and decided to try.   Casual and modern atmosphere - can get a bit loud during the busy lunch time!   Food is 5/5 for me. I got the lunch special - char grilled pork chop loin (?) and it was delicious! Price was around 6.8 pounds and plenty of food! I would say the dish is on the saltier side, but still very very delicious. The dish came with potatoes which were also perfect.   My wife got a linguini special that has crabs and the dish was full of that ocean/sea taste. It's like you're sitting at the beach- just in front of the ocean and then a little bit of paprika's spiciness brings that warmth of the beach sunshine.   Also got the bread for two and it was worth it. Three pieces of warm bread with butter and I believe it was pesto butter! Bread was crunchy and hard on the outside and soft inside. Perfect way to start our UK trip!   Recommend for lunch!!",

The space is very cool with some benches in nooks and an upstairs seating as well.   We started with the smoked Aubergine and buckwheat pancakes. It was fairly unique I admit but it worked pretty well. The aubergine was very flavourful and smoked well. The pancakes were fine but a bit plain I suppose.   I got the roast lamb rump with courgette cake. The lamb was good though rather fatty. But at least I could cut around the fat. The courgette cakes were actually a highlight of the dish. Very smooth, almost decadent flavour. I'd get the dish again but just wish there was less fat on the lamb - a meatier cut would be ideal.",

We had actually made reservations earlier in the day. And when I asked if we could have a window table, we were told that he didn't have one, yet we watched one sit vacant the entire hour and half we were there.    Good initial service from a left handed waitress! Never came back to ask how it was.  But was prompt with the bill.  They are not paid a living wage but hourly based on age!  Be 21...  My partner ordered the delicious mussels and I tried the spicy lamb meatballs.  The Sauvignon Blanc was mediocre.  The food really is good, really good.  However, the management didn't even say goodbye or thank you for coming in on our anniversary.  Just stood there looking busy.  It doesn't seem like they care much about their operation.",

Prices are reasonable for the quality of food. Our meals were excellent with a nice gourmet edge. My gnocchi with squash, tomatoes and roasted walnuts served in a blue cheese cream sauce was lovely. My companions had the grilled chicken and prawn skewers with a beet salad stuffed pita that was great to look at and all reported it delicious! Plus the garlic fries are a \"must try\" too!  I'd recommend this restaurant to visitors to Edinburgh!",

The hand cut fries on the side were fine, tasted like potato but I didn't like the salad that came with the main. The salad was a bit bitter and too much red onion overwhelmed it.  Overall, very mediocre place. Nothing special about it, nothing particularly Scottish or British. And the most outrageous part was that despite mostly absent/mediocre service, they automatically add a 12% tip.   I would recommend skipping this place unless nowhere else is available.",

It came quickly and was pretty good. Then we ordered and we waited and waited and waited and then were surprised when the wine finished and the food wasn't there and then we counted the time. When the waitress starts ignoring you or when you see her in the back waiting, you know something is wrong. Food finally comes, gnocchi doesn't take an hour. We would've asked why it took so long but she ignored us when we kept trying to ask why dinner took so long. Part of the order is wrong.   \"Oh we can make it for you right away!\"   Right, but the first batch took an hour?  We ask for the check and for boxes.   \"Oh we don't do carry out\"   (most places here don't, we were naive/hopeful)  Fine. We haven't touched our food. Can we have the check?  10 minutes later, they give us check. We have to wait for them to come back to provide payment.  Eventually We had our gnocchi wrapped in aluminum foil and we gave it to someone who looked hungry outside. No offer of sorry or asking why or anything. Basically nothing from the staff.   I really liked everything else about Edinburgh.",

So the food arrived, with a decent delay between the two of us, my rib eye was of poor quality and burnt - with no salt. Nice one, if you have to ask for salt and wait another five minutes. And instead of grilled vegetables, I had baked potates.. what a mess.   Matching this screwed up eevning the waitress had added 12% tip on the bill, even though the menu said it is only added for tables of 5 and larger...   What a waist of time money and calories...",

The food has always been good - I think I have been 2 or 3 times now.   What lets this restaurant down is the service. They are a bit obsessive about taking your coats off you - my husband always keeps his wallet in his coat so doesn't like giving it up - the staff were quite embarassing in their insistance. The service is not friendly or timely. The manager has had stand up rows with diners while I was there too.   Other friends have had bad experiences both here and more so at the Apartment (the sister restaurant).   In the apartment one set of friends were told that they would have to leave if the hen put on a veil she had been given. Another set of friends were treated very shabbily because they were on a fancy dress night out.   Won't be going back - a shame cos food is good but they seem to think that they are better than their customers.",

Ask for a table near the back window if you wish to impress.   The food is great. Lunch is excellent value. Dinner is a bit more expensive but you kind of expect that given the location and the nature of the place. And it's varied, tasty, imaginately put together, great wine list. Everything you'd expect from a smart but casual place in the middle of Edinburgh.   The Outsider is very unlikely to disappoint.",

I phoned ahead and booked a castle view table, which didn't disappoint, having lived in Edinburgh for many years I was still very impressed by the view. I got the skirt steak and chips which was cooked perfectly, we tried all the 3 smaller starters on the menu  the pig cheeks were probably the best of the three. All four of us really enjoyed the meal and the restaurant had a really nice atmosphere. I would definitely recommend  also great place to take friends visiting Edinburgh!",

    "text": "Happy Tourists!  Just in town for one afternoon/night, we came here on the recommendation of the Hotel Missoni bellman.  Great recommendation.  He suggested we come early for a table with view of Edinburgh Castle, and we were seated right near the window.  Delicious, crusty yet soft-centered bread with pesto for dipping. They have \"lunch\" specials till 5 p.m. We arrived just before that, not by design, and lingered over our drinks and dinner for nearly two hours, but didn't feel at all hurried by the waitstaff despite our prime window spot for two.  We squeezed in a lunch order of sea bass just before 5 to share as a starter (delicious) with a nice pinot grigio, then shared a dinner (because we weren't in a rush to decide, and so many things sounded good!) main course of puisson stuffed with couscous and accompanied by hand-cut chips, along with a side of risotto (not on the menu as a side item, but they accommodated us).  Very nice staff and ambiance, loved the view, and the food and wine were great. We didn't have dessert because we were too full, but the offerings sounded intriguing--figs, polenta cake, etc.  Lunch prices are very affordable--fresh sea bass for 7 pounds, for example.  If we get back to Edinburgh, we'll make a it a point to visit again.",

On the downside - the noise level was a bit high, which is my overall complaint with so many places in the UK. How one is supposed to have a meaningful conversation when it is hard to hear your own thoughts? I guess you end up shouting more, which just adds to the noise level.",

Sure it's a bit overly crowded (there probably should be 20% fewer tables), but the service is spot on the food was among the best I had whilst up in Edinburgh. Great location too right on George IV bridge.  As for what to order, the chunky healthy lines are massive, great if you are starving. I had the chili beef salad which was very well prepared and tasty. My friend's sea bass was elegantly presented.  Even though they charge extra for bread, it's worth the 90p splurge as the bread is freshly baked and really delicious. The lunch specials were all reasonable with most mains in the 6 to 8 pound range.  Next time I am definitely ordering one of their burgers. They look amazing!",

The view Edinburgh Castle is impressive, so it's a good daylight dining choice. The lunch is competitively priced. It's very popular, so a booking is required. But it all felt rather passe, to me, and both dishes that I had looked rather better than they tasted.  Overall, we said: \"I didn't have a particularly strong reaction, for or against the place. My abiding impression was of a restaurant that was a well-worn favourite for many of its patrons, with all the positive and negative connotations that that brings. The owners and staff members know what they're doing, and they're very comfortable with delivering it, but it felt like a place that had been trapped in aspic for a little too long. But if it ain't broke, don't fix it, as they say, and based on the crowded restaurant they had, today, their model still strongly appeals.\"",

The squid didn't absorb the great taste of the chorizo. Too bad because the sausage is really tasty. My main was the lamb and feta balls. I really liked it but love the taste of lamb. Sandra was less of a fan. Her sea bass and scallops was good but lacked enough sauce to make it all the way through the meal. In the end, the tastes were really good but each meal was about 90% of perfect.",

    "text": "The reasons I have fallen hook, line and sinker for The Outsider:  It's a neighbourhood restaurant where locals and families go to eat. It's opposite one of my favourite bars and pre-club venues - Villager. It's decorated tastefully with rustic wooden tables, patterned cushions and hints of colour. It has a private booth that seats four to six. It has breathtaking views of the Castle. It has a fab wine-list including one of the most beautiful and berrylicious Shiraz I've ever drunk. It serves totally delicious food - my favourite dish being the grilled hallumi kebabs with pitta, coleslaw and salad. It has sugar-rushing deserts that match the flavour and intensity of the wine.  It has friendly and efficient staff that don't mind if you stay one hour or three.  It's named after Albert Camus's classic existential masterpiece.*    *If it isn't named after Albert Camus's novel, it probably takes its name from Francis Ford Coppola's equally awesome 80s movie.",

I suppose it's odd to start out with saying that this was a \"second best\" meal, because honestly, I still think about the fish I had at The Outsider--it was perfect!  It was both attractive and delicious and creative (there were sea vegetables decorating the outside of the dish that perfectly complimented the fish--and it was nice to look at).  My husband had the pigeon, which was also yummy, and we split a salad to start and the plum tart to finish.  We also had a wonderful view of the castle (and our waitress was nice enough to take a photo of us with the castle in the background).  We liked this restaurant so much that we were tempted to just eat here throughout our stay in Edinburgh.  Although we had other nice meals, this was, by far, the best in Edinburgh and the best meal we had in the 2 weeks we were in the UK (including time in London).",

The food's always great, the staff are lovely, and the venue is elegant and has great views over the rooftops to the castle. We sat at a window seat the first time we went, and I think it was love at first lunch - I've just hooked on the place ever since.   I've been there for work, with friends, with family - and regularly for lunch with Jason when we're in town. I'll confess I do order the mussels 98% of the time, because they're amazing, but I have tried other options and it's always good! At lunch there are specials, plus a list of eight-or-so regular options, all reasonably priced. In the evening, it's fun to start with the chunky skewers to share. And do get the bread and olives - giant, luscious olives and hefty chunks of bread.   I'm hungry now....",

We did not order drinks but when the waitress asked for our orders, we asked for a starter salad to split. The waitress told us rather harshly that we were not allowed to order a starter due to the time constraint. We ended up leaving and found a nearby restaurant that was able to serve us a starter, entrees, and a dessert in a similar time constraint. Perhaps the food is good but don't expect to be treated with respect here if you do not have a reservation.",

The menu had interesting choices and there were several items to satisfy the diverse tastes of my group.  The service was a bit slow and our server was forgetful but friendly.  We had questions about the menu and she was unfamiliar with specifics and \"meant\" to ask the chef.  After we got tired of waiting for the answers, we just ordered.  The two starters we shared were great, goat cheese profiteroles and pea soup with ham roulette.  The mains were underwhelming.  If you like real gnocchi, this selection is not what you would expect.  The gnocchi was sliced rectangle of  \"pasta\" of a similar consistency as gnocchi but not as good. My husband had the chicken and prawn skewers which he said were \"okay\".  My daughter had the sea bream which was delicious.  The restaurant was very accommodating for special requests for food allergies.",

She can have Gluten and nuts which makes me think she might just be crazy. Her favourite meal in the world is pizza but it might kill her....  Anyway,  we had to find someone that wasn't too \"tomato-ee\" for her.  This was a good bet.  The chunky healthy lines made a great starter for me and man-friend, and a great main for wife-thing. The rustic bread and olive oil we got with it was delightful.   My mail was some coley and frankly a nicer piece of fish I have never had. My only slight complaint was that the salad and potato that came with it were a bit frugal. The piece of fish was a bit wee as well (if utterly delicious) which basically is a bit upsetting when a chunky healthy line is HUGE and cost 3 less!  Anyway it was a great experience. Staff were great and helpful and nice.  We enjoyed it and my mates wife didn't die.  Solid.",

The waitress offered nothing by way of creating ANYTHING my daughter could eat, save for a salad or removing the meats from skewer dishes.  Calling to make a reservation was difficult as I was asked to hold the line for 5 minutes at a time and then hung up on.  Twice.  Table service was slow, had to repeatedly ask for parts of order that had been forgotten (including the bread which was half my daughter's meal).

My Dad was visiting me and so took me out for lunch, perfect opportunity.  The staff were very friendly, if anything a little too laid back, but can't complain. The menu all sounded delicious and i opted for the salmon fishcake served with mussels (only 3 but still good) and a poached egg on top, i would definitely have this again. My Dad had an aubergine based dish which was also delicious and we shared a side of garlicky fries.  The feel of the restaurant is very contemporary and chilled out. Although it was pretty chilly in there so next time i might wrap up a bit.  To finish my Dad had a passion fruit tart with rhubarb, obviously i trid some then regretted not getting one myself. I had a cappuccino which was sprinkled with shaved chocolate, always a good sign in my book.  I will definitely be back here again soon! :)",

What looks like an apparently 'nameless' restaurant on George IV Bridge....... with a lovely chalk lunch menu outside and what looks like a lovely air-y space inside.  I ended up *finally* getting to go to the Outsider as a wee treat before leaving Edinburgh, and I gotta say it was the perfect choice!!! This place is elegant but laid back, the food has a good modern twist but it presented a little slap-dash and slightly rustic which I quite liked. The service is friendly and I found myself wishing I had come here more before leaving!  My Pigeon with Serrano Ham with a mix of beans and beetroot salsa was heavenly!!!? I only wish I had been a little more hungry and had some starter and dessert! From what I can gather the menu seems to change very frequently which I think is fab. I would definitely go again for dinner and I have heard that the lunch offer is ace!",

Deciding that I liked both the price and the selection (and their kir royale drink special), I went in on a whim. It was a few minutes before noon, and the restaurant was very quiet. I ordered the kir royale I was hankering for, and a lentil and goat cheese salad. Shortly after, the restaurant began filling up with other patrons who also seemed to enjoy a lunchtime drink. The noise level rose, but not to an overwhelming level, and I was soon placated when my food came.   I admit that I've never had a better salad. There were perfectly cooked lentils, briny, creamy goat cheese bits, and delicious crunchy greens in a light vinaigrette. The kir royale was also lovely. I escaped with only an 12 pound bill, and decided that I would return soon.  Not one to break my word, I have returned two times since, once for the venison ravioli, which was a little bloodier tasting than I would have liked, and once for the baked gnocchi with pesto, which did not disappoint.   I would highly recommend The Outsider for lunch. Their lunch menu is reasonably priced, and the food quality is excellent.",

I really cannot find anything wrong with this place.  I try to divide my luncheon life between Treacle and the Outsider, with the occasional sidestep to Dogs or even a shimmy towards somewhere else, but pretty much these three places have it covered, depending on the end of town in which you find yourself.  If you're lucky they'll give you a table in the window with a view across the Old Town. Lovely spot to drink some wine and enjoy the food. I mostly go for lunch but when I've gone for dinner I always start with the large skewers which are good for sharing. Monkfish and bacon skewers are always popular. In fact the general mix of dishes makes it a great place to bring guests. It's always top of my list to recommend to visitors.  And would you Adam and Eve it but they possibly do the best burger in town. I always say I'm not going to get the burger as the place is too stylish to order such a declasse dish, but their chilli burger with gruyere cheese is fantastic.  I do have one gripe in that they don't have an online menu, or indeed a website (a cardinal sin in my book), but I forgive them. While the menu changes, I know the standards just about by heart. Well, it's not that difficult to memorise \"Chilli burger and a beer, please. And can I have the table in the window?\"",

From one visit I deduce they have a competitively priced guest wine of the day, pencilled into the list much like a food special (has anyone been two days in a row to verify if this is legit?!). The evening I went it was a lovely Viognier, a carafe of which was expertly and effortlessly dispatched.  But I'm getting slightly ahead of myself...   Considering that the booking was made a generous two-an'-an-odd-bit weeks ahead, and that they have tables with castle views, we were really disappointed to be tucked away at a dinky little table in the corner of the mezzanine level. Butted up against the wall, our view consisted of the diners downstairs through a glass partition.  I had a starter of portabello mushroom with an exotic cheese I hadn't heard of (and neither had the waitress, but who other than that was knowledgeable and attentive). It was OK, the mushroom had been fired directly on the hob presumably and at any rate tasted a little of gas.  My main of roast lamb however was absolutely gorgeous. Caramelised on the outside, melt-in-the-mouth on the inside (pretty pink mind, but that was fine by me). The accompaniments were spot on too.  The way they've done the menu is quirky but not sure I would go as far as to label this place an 'outsider' of the trade. But for gastronauts or those out to impress a date it is definitely worth a visit.",

    "text": "I was looking for a restaurant reviewed by a Yelp friend when the clouds opened up and I ran into the nearest doorway only to find myself in The Outsider, the restaurant I was looking for in the first place.    The host was super friendly and seated me in the loft upstairs which boasts terrific views up the to castle.  I ordered grilled mackerel from the daily set menu.  It came with a rocket (arugula) salad and other nice, fresh veg.  I have been a little wary about mackerel in the past, expecting a strong, oily fish but this one was flavourful with a nice crispy skin.  Service from Ms. Emma was quick and friendly and I was able to enjoy my meal in less than an hour and get out to an early evening Fringe show.",

    "text": "Love this spot. It is my go-to when out of town guests are visiting. Dinner will run you about 25-30/pp, but if you are looking for a bargain go for lunch. Lunch tends to be under 10, and always under 15. Really good quality food, attentively prepared, thoughtfully presented, great Castle views, simple-classic dining atmosphere.",

    "text": "Great food, a nice vibe, and a staff that went out of their way to accomodate us - twice! First time we went and didn't have a reservation (recommended) but they fit us in at a very busy time. Next visit, we showed up on time but met up with 2 friends there who had a reservation for an hour later. Could they get us all in at the same time at the same table? Yes! Really liked the food and the presentation. The cheese with the crusty bread (app) was wonderful as were the olives.",

The downside is really inconsistent portion size. Some of the meals will leave you hungry while others are seriously overstuffing.   Is it niggly? a bit, but the portion sizes are really varied -- some of the lunch mains should really be called starters.",

But this may be consistent to the European, no rush, way. This was not the only restaurant that was slow in this city. The food, however, was delicious. Very pleased!",
