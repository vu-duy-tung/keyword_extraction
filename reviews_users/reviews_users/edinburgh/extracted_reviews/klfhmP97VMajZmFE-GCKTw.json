Or checking if their prosecco was veggie.  The staff totally took this in their stride and looked after me brilliantly. Many thanks",

    "text": "I went here with my daughter and we decided to start with a Cesar salad but they don't use anchovy to prepare it, instead they use a \"of the shelf\" Cesar salad dressing...not good for us that frequently have REAL Cesar salad. Then I asked for a carbonara pasta but I inquired about if they prepare the real Italian carbonate with an egg and parmesan cheese  ...again they use a \"carbonara cream sauce\" from the shelf.  Two basic classic Italian dishes that are so easy to prepare and because they cut corner I was not impressed. Other reason why I did not gave the third start is because the long time waiting between we received the menus and when the waitress came back to take the orders. The place was not crowed at that time but looks to me that they are short on server.  I won't come back here, there are so many Italian restaurants in Edinburgh that I will pick one that at least is run by an Italian or have real knowledge of the Italian cuisine.",

Occasion one, I had pizza, and the second-time round was pasta.  On both occasions, I shared the arancini with the other person :)    The food on both visits was pleasant.  The noise doesn't carry too much, even if it's busy.  The staff are friendly, and it's good, quick service.  The decor is colourful and fun, full of kitchen implements and gadgets!  It's a handy place to have in the West End for something quick to eat as well as filling.",

    "text": "I usually avoid big chain restaurants but had lunch here today with the girls in the office and had to say I was pleasantly surprised.  The decor is clean and bright. The staff are friendly and there is something to please everyone on the menu. 4 in the group had the meat calzone and all plates were empty at the end, the sauce was good but I found my cheese was a bit clumpy at one end. The chilli oil was a good addition. One of the girls asked for no mushroom and they were happy to do that.  They were ok with us paying on separate cards to settle the bill. The bathroom is downstairs & there's colouring in stuff if you're with small humans. Price point is fairly on par with other big chains, so slightly pricey for what you're getting but not hugely extortionate.",

The presentation of my dessert was really good, and watching the tower melt was entertaining. That tower melted pretty quickly!  It came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and merengue. The overall taste of my dessert was okay. I tried the chocolate mousse, and it's alright. It was in a espresso cup, and came with cookies and a shot of espresso. The wait staff was super nice. The ambiance and decor was nice as well. Is it worth going back there for dessert? Yes. They have a good selection of dessert here. I chose the melting dessert because it looked really cool.",

    "text": "I did try to like it.  I was there by myself and I wasn't the only one. This is a good place for people to enjoy a meal for 1. It is bright, roomy and sound doesn't carry so much.   The serving staff were nice and welcoming, perhaps a little inexperienced.   I requested king prawns on a bruschetta and a linguini carbonara with some mushrooms added in.   It all came in quickish fashion and indeed piping hot!  However the prawns were still shelled, no problem for me, but it is a messy way of eating and only one 2 ply napkin didn't stem the flow of juices from the prawns onto my fingers, palm, wrist... messy eaters unite! I decided to wash my hands in the toilets after.  The linguini LOOKED exactly how I wanted it, with plenty of extra mushrooms, and was served very warm. I was offered pepper and cheese. which I both took.  I tasted this and.. where was the taste, it didn't taste like anything, not like creamy sauce, not like bacon or cheese, just bland.   I had to add chilli, more pepper and salt to get some taste out of it. Shame, but not something I can really put down to cooking, but more to personal taste: I. don't. do. bland.   A couple of Peroni beers suited me nicely.   It is not something I'd recommend, but the place is nice and possibly other dishes may taste better. So if I am invited I wouldn't say no.",

    "text": "Surprisingly, considering I love Italian food, I have never been to an Ask restaurant before. I hadn't noticed this restaurant, tucked away in Shandwick Place, until my friends recommended we try it on Saturday night for dinner.   The decor is lovely and fresh and there are plenty of tables. The staff were friendly and attentive (although they did take a long time to deliver a cappuccino at the end of the meal) and the prices are pretty standard for this type of chain restaurant.   I had the carbonara which was a bit disappointing. It was a 'new recipe' but I found it to be a bit bland, although the pasta itself was cooked perfectly. My friends had one of the pizzas (they're long and square, a bit like the ones in Zizzi) and the spaghetti seafood dish.   I tried a mixture of the gelato and sorbet for dessert which was lovely.   All in all, a nice experience. But not nice enough to sway me away from, say, Vittoria's or Pizza Express the next time I fancy an Italian.",
