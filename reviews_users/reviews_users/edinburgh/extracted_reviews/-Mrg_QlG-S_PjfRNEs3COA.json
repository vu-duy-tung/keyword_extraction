The staff make the atmosphere delicious, too, with their outstanding personalities. Overall, this is the type of place you could go to every week and always have a marvelous experience. Every dish served competes with the previous dish served for the spot of the best item on the menu. There is no way to order the wrong thing at this restaurant. The chef's culinary artistry is magnificent.",

    "text": "I'd really enjoyed ROLLO's previous branch in Stockbridge and so was excited to see it opening up on Broughton Street. This branch hasn't changed much; the menu and styling remain almost identical.   The food is really rather good. It's more of a sharing menu composed of different sized dishes rather than a standard starter/main course/dessert.  Lamb shoulder salad was a high point, as was the duck. The scallops were nice although there are probably better value dishes on the menu.   The sides here are pretty substantial and the potatoes in particular were fantastic. Even though I was already pretty full the caramel tart was absolutely worth every bite. I'd make sure I left room for dessert next time if this is the standard.  The venue is a little bigger than in Stockbridge but through in the back can be quite dark, and the dark grey decor doesn't help to make the place feel any brighter. The music is quite loud and was a little random (ranging from the Beatles, early noughties pop and easy-listening).  Overall the food is good and so is the wine. I wasn't quite as excited by it as I was on the initial visit to Stockbridge but they are sticking to what they do well. The vibe makes it more of wine bar that happens to do good food than a restaurant that does nice wine, which I think is what they are going for. Still it's worth a visit.",

Wow was it an awesome experience.  The servers and service  were first class.  The spring roll appetizer was the  best I have ever experienced.  Great wine selection and awesome desserts. If you find yourself in Edinburgh you cannot leave without going to Rollo's",

    "text": "Don't pass this up! We came here for dinner tonight and thoroughly enjoyed it. We started with some 'bites' -- one haggis and one arancini, both of which were great. The pork belly was massive and cooked to perfection, while the beef filet was also well prepared. The only complaint I had with the beef was that the portion is too small and hidden under a large rocket and parmesan salad. For desert we shared the chocolate tarte, which was delicious for chocolate lovers. Warning to those who don't love chocolate, the tarte may be too rich for you; it's intense!  We didn't have any mixed drinks, but the bartender seemed very competent; we saw him whipping things up throughout our meal that all looked great. Toward the end of the meal, the restaurant filled up and waiter service got slower. This is understandable but something to keep in mind if you're in a rush. Last thing: definitely make a reservation if you can. We walked in and had to sit at a high-top table at the bar since the other tables had been reserved in advance. Nonetheless, we enjoyed our dinner fully!",

This is a great addition to the Broughton St collection of restaurants, the third to open in recent months. Staff were welcoming and really informed about the wines and food. Vibe was very upbeat and lively but you can still hear conversations. For the 5 stars it goes without saying that the food and Sicilian red were great. I had tortilla strips with a hummus-like really scrumpy white bean dip for starters, and a tabbouleh-like main dish, made interesting with pomegranate seeds. The menu takes some seemingly simple/classic dishes but delivers them with more unusual ingredients and lots of rich flavours. Can't wait to go back.",

The owner is a lovely vivacious young woman who is not only friendly, but efficient and welcoming.  The food is super.  Small bowls and plates of unique yummy combinations.  Our 2nd visit, we brought 4 friends with us and the were so impressed.  In fact, they had met people on the train to Edinburgh, who when told they were going to Rollo, couldn't give it enough praise.  Great selection of wine and cocktails.  Don't miss this place.",
