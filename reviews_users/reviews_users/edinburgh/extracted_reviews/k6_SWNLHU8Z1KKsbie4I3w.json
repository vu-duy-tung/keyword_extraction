    "text": "'Yay! I'm a fan', I mean, obviously, I'm in here about once a week (if not more frequently).  As sandwich chains go, Pret is up there. Interesting combinations, a nod to food trends (Carb-free, Korean etc.) and lots of yummy fresh juices. I mean, yeah, it's a bit pricey, but it's all pretty decent quality and way, way better than grabbing a supermarket sarnie in your lunchtime rush.  Plus, they give their unused food away for free to charity and support homelessness organisations (this year's Christmas sandwiches are supporting the Glasgow City Mission), so you can feel good about yourself whilst eating a delicious baguette. Hurrah!",

    "text": "Pret a Manger is a coffee shop chain that serves fresh, tasty sandwiches.  My favorite breakfast bite is their breakfast baguette; it's so good I wish it was also available at lunchtime :-(  As for the coffee, it's nothing to write home about; a serviceable source of a morning shot of cafeeine if you don't have time to get a cup of premium Java elsewhere.   So why am I giving this place only three stars?  I find their attitude about receipts more than a bit annoying.  I've never gone in and had them simply give me a receipt when I pay my check - I always have to ask for it, even if I'm paying by credit card :-(",

    "text": "So I always walked past Pret A Manger with a 'what a chain, it can't be that good' kind of look on my face.   Man. I was wrong. I have had two visits to a Pret A Manger, one in Glasgow, one in Edinburgh. So the list of things I have sampled so far is not too high, it consists of coffee and soup. The coffee was ok, but then again you don't really go here for JUST the coffee. The soup, I had a Bacon and Corn Chowder and it was scrummy!   The selection of sandwiches, wraps, toasties, salads here is second to none that I have seen in any other chain. I wanted to get them all!  Smoked Salmon sandwich - yes please! Jalapeno Chicken Warm wrap - pass me one! Crayfish and advocado Salad - hit me up with some of that! Haloumi and Red Pepper Toastie - Damn!  ......I could go on seriously. I stood in front of those fridges switching between all these options in my mind and then realised the solution was simple. I will just have to come back.",

    "text": "When I was reviewing places in Glasgow, I made no secret of the fact that I absolutely adore Pret A Manger, I actually LOVE it and have even started getting cravings for their delicious, freshly made baguettes. They also have an amazing range of cakes including the moistest carrot cake I've ever eaten. For the quality of the produce the prices aren't all that bad and if you're on a budget and only feeling slightly peckish you can get all the baguettes in half sized portions. Sometimes if I can't decide what baguette to go for, I'll get a half of each one. Yum.  I love everything about Pret, the cans of fizzy pop with cute pictures on them, the baguettes with the freshest ingredients, the friendly staff and their recycling policy. In fact, I would give this particular branch six stars if I could due to the large seating area that is often lacking in other Pret branches.  On a recent trip in I discovered they have a new baguette on the block, I couldn't believe my eyes as I snatched up a sweet chilli king prawn baguette with roasted red peppers and parsley. It was absolutely delicious, I can't describe how good it was, you'll just have to venture in and try the wonderment for yourself!",

However, in the attempt to try something new, I wandered into this place and decided it was time to get to know what all the fuss was about.  Frankly, I was dissapointed - iuts just a sandwich shop. There are the usual selections of sandwiches and cakes and drinks, but nothing that really makes this place stick out from the crowd of other sandwich places in the city. Sure, its nice enough, but I personally would rather go to a local none-chain place.",

I quite enjoy some things such as the hot wraps and their scrumptious puddings, however for me Pret are too pricey for more than the occasional lunchtime treat.",
