    "text": "Xanadu is the exotic name of a Chinese Restaurant n the bosom of the busy London Road in Edinburgh. It offers a warm and relaxing atmosphere adding to it a 30 years of cooking experience of the chef of the place. The restaurant has a special selection of Cantonese flavoured specialties of home cooked dishes - from the so popular Peking duck to Cowboy in honeymoon (shredded fillet of beef with peaches and sugar snap peas),Tropical chicken boat (chicken, mango and pineapple), and the savoury Lobster with ginger and spring onions, served with noodles. The range of seafood meals is also impressive,",

    "text": "This is one of the more authentic Cantonese restaurants to be found in Edinburgh. As usual, there is a 'Chinese' menu and a 'Westerner's' menu, the latter catered a bit more to the Western palate. We had the salt and pepper squid (definitely a winner), the char siu (best I've had in Edinburgh), and a traditional seafood clay pot.  While the curb appeal and the decor leaves passerby's unsure of the quality inside, the food is definitely worth sitting in for and enjoying! We will be back!!",

    "text": "Not eaten in so can't say much about the decor, the exterior had always put me off going in everything time I'd walked past. But it came highly recommended from a friend so decided to take the plunge and order some takeout.  Ordered the set dinner for 2. Opting for spicy tofu in place of the beef with black bean. Everything was very tasty and nothing was over/under seasoned which is a pleasant change from some of the other takeout I've had! I believe they are also MSG free which is a major major bonus in my books!  Considering it's now not far from my flat. I envisage getting food from here again and probably pretty soon!",

The food is delightful, fresh, filling and not stuffed with MSG. I love the crab and sweetcorn soup, the chilli and honey shredded chicken and the sweet and sour prawns.",

    "text": "Hidden away in plain view on London Road (Dalziel Place), Xanadu really is worth a trip into part of Edinburgh not generally associated with restaurants. Cards on the tables display not only specials of the day but also a promise that no MSG is used. While dishes are standard Chinese UK restaurant fare, the freshness of the ingredients is evident and tasty. Favourites include Spare Ribs as a starter and Kung Po King Prawns or Crispy Shredded Beef as a main.  Downsides are the slightly institutional feel of the decor and the classic pop hits on Chinese instruments piped muzak. An additional plus is the friendliness of the staff.",

    "text": "Apart from the awesome name, Xanadu didn't bear well in my estimations. A group of friends from uni had visited the Chinese restaurant earlier last year and they weren't impressed with the food. However, when I got the chance to visit for a family members birthday meal, so I went with low expectations.  The decor is very...blue! That's all I can really say! The tables and chairs were lovely and looked ornate, which made for an interesting talking point. The waiter was very nice, although he didn't really say much, I don't actually think he could speak much English to be honest.   I decided to order one of the chef's specials from the menu, which are exclusive to Xanadu. I opted for the seafood nest combination, scallops, king prawns and squid in a Cantonese sauce, all wrapped in a delicious filo parcel which was outstanding. I absolutely love seafood and I am always a bit funny about ordering it in a Chinese restaurant, as I usually find it a bit undercooked for my tastes, but this seafood was cooked to absolute perfection.  The house wine we ordered for the table was gorgeous too, and had a lovely sweet edge, which complimented my meal perfectly.  I don't know what must have happened when my friends went that night, but I can honestly say Xanadu was one of the best Chinese meals I have ever had.",
