It's positioning at first seems perhaps not that ideal, but Grassmarket is 5 minutes away and Lava Ignite is even closer so it's well worth considering adding it to your root home.  They do more than just chips, however, and you can pick from a good range of items, but quite frankly I always go for what they do best.",

    "text": "Sure this place is cheap, but you get what you pay for...I have been here twice...the pizza is so greasy and soggy...the staff are sort of awkward, nice, but a bit creepy and I felt a smidgen uncomfortable. The second time I got a doner kebab and this was the worst doner that I have ever had. The meat was overcooked and flavourless...the slices were far to big, the vegetable and sauce selection was limited to cabbage, lettuce, onions, and mayo and hot sauce...these vegetables weren't fresh...Why are you selling doner, if your not going to put the effort in to make it authentic or at least add some more veg selection and almost like the cherry on top...there is a 50p charge for card payment. They do however have a twenty percent student discount.",

It was for take away and I threw the kebab away half way through eating it was so bad.  The kebab came out quick but I'd prefer to wait for freshly cooked chicken.  Go to samsuns or trek over to kebab mahal for a good kebab.",
