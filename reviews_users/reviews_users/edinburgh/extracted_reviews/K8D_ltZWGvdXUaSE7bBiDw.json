    "text": "The Southern Cross cafe is a contemporary eaterie where you can get everything from panini's to haggis as a main!   I must say, my eyes almost popped out my head when I saw the price of said panini's - some of them were over a fiver! But they looked tasty, were well made and this seems to be the standard charge for any food business near the Royal Mile.  There's quite a lot of space to stretch out inside, and I like the shape of the restaurant since it's windy, abstract and off kilter. There are some intimate tables tucked away in cosy corners and enough space for a sneaky bit of people watching towards the front door.  As for the food, it ranges from Italian pasta options to Mediterranean fillings for sandwiches. As well as fulfilling your quota of carby goodness, there are also haggis options, including an appetizer pot for 3.50! This is great for the adventurous tourist or the Scottish fan of this spicy snack.  So although I almost grudged paying 2.40 for a hot chocolate, I was too swayed by the quality of this lovely little den to care about the cost.",

My favourate thing has to be the outside seating however, there is nothing better than sitting outside with a coffee, a tuna melt panini (in my opinion the best they do here) and watching the world go by.

Coffee was alright, not the worst I have had, but not the best.  I then decided to have the very tempting sounding Sweet Potato and Chorizo soup. What a let down it was. I do not know if it is a Scottish thing, or an Islander thing but I want to be able to stick wallpaper up with my soup! This was a very orange looking dishwater. It did not taste of much..... and more to the point no chunks of sweet potato.... or chorizo!?!?! I ate it all but was not very satisfied at all.   So basically I would maybe go back, but might avoid the soup next time just incase!",

This resulted in a very small, quesadilla-like sandwich which should have been much cheaper based on the bread swap. We were excited to try the soup of the day which was potato leek, but were disappointed that our sandwiches came with tomato soup (which was far too sweet) and wish they had told us they were out of the soup before we ordered. Overall we felt that we could have gotten a tastier and more substantial meal for far cheaper.",

I visited a couple of years ago, and the breakfast was priced well for a full Scottish breakfast, with choice of standard haggis, or veggie haggis.   The veggie version was fantabulous!

You'd be wrong.  I'd say it's somewhere between a cafe and a bistro, as it's licensed to serve alcohol and it's open until around midnight. And the quality's so much higher than you'd expect - both the service and the actual food itself. I went with a friend recently, and we managed to nab ourselves one of the half dozen or so outdoor tables which meant we had prime people-watching range all over Cockburn Street and the adjacent Hunter Square.  We only had coffees, but the food menu did have some tasty-looking things on it that caught my eye, and I'll be heading back here soon for a spot of lunch to give it a whirl. It's never going to win any awards for offering the best value for money of all the eateries in Edinburgh, but don't let that put you off.",

Fancying a bit of that myself, I tottered in and had a look at the very reasonable and tasty looking menu.  I left a few minutes later with some juice and a cheese toastie which I didn't think was too expensive  for the location of the cafe. The queue was massive as I pushed past loads of hungry folk, old and young this time, and I found myself wondering what this cafe had to pull in the punters like it did. Taking a bite of my toastie, which was hotter than the sun on the inside (be warned!), I realised that there really is nothing like a bit of home cooked comforts, especially if you're travelling and need to be perked up with a toasted sandwich like your granny makes.   Great wee caff, well worth a visit but don't expect to get a seat outside!",

One quick peek of the menu from outside was all it took to lure me in. I was only after a light bite so when Chicken & Cheddar Quesadillas with Fresh Salad jumped out at me, it was a done deal.   I opted for a seat in the back room, which was dimly lit, with colourful, quirky art on the walls and Vampire Weekend playing on the music system.   It took a few minutes for someone to come over and ask what I wanted to order but when they did, they were smiley and polite so I forgave them instantly.   The food wasn't anything amazing but then I wasn't really expecting Michelin Star cuisine from a small cafe. It could have been a little more flavoursome though. A few herbs / spices would have helped but it's not the end of the world.   I washed it down with a glass of Fentiman's Ginger Beer then settled the bill - 7.90, which I suppose isn't too bad.   Next time I'm in Edinburgh (there WILL be a next time), I don't think I'll go here again as there are sooooo many other cute cafes to choose from, but it certainly did its job in ensuring I had a good feed and watering ahead of my long and tedious journey back to Manc Land.",

Southern Cross Cafe, situated on the pleasant Cockburn Street (right off the Royal Mile) makes a mean breakfast and a fantastic (strong) cup of coffee. The pancakes are amazing (and caramelized!), poached eggs are perfectly poached, nice big croissants, lovely tattie scones... great start the the day.   Very reasonably priced (you can easily eat here for under 10), with options on the menu to suit every appetite. Decor is fun (kind of constellation-night sky themed, which makes sense considering the cafe's name) plenty of seating, friendly staff.",

It was quite busy which made for a nice atmosphere and they managed to squeeze our group of five in after a short wait.  Whilst everyone else had coffees and tasty looking scones and jam (but with squirty cream rather than clotted!), I indulged in haggis bon bons!  They were deep fried little balls of haggis accompanied by a mustard mayo. They were not only really yummy but also a great way to sample haggis whilst in Bonny Scotland!  Ps. The signs downstairs and in the toilets are fantastic! Pop down and make your favourite your motto for the week!",

    "text": "Slightly better than average place with free wi-fi.  I don't exactly love it, there's nothing unique about it and something about the atmosphere wasn't totally comfortable, but there's nothing really wrong with the place. As other reviewers have said, the service is variable, usually fine, but sometimes I don't know, stern maybe?  There is lots of natural light despite being in perpetually balmy Scotland. I've been twice now and got breakfast both times (their breakfast menu ends at lunch time, but they do a full or full vegetarian till later in the day). The vegetarian haggis is not really what I imagine hangs to be. Usually with vegetarian, it is cooked like the regular but is just slightly smoother as it doesn't have those bits in (the suet I think), but the Southern Cross version seemed like basically kidney beans and barley mixed together, so  texture wise it was like chunky mashed potatoes. Anyway, it was alright as it's own thing, but I wouldn't call it veg haggis.   The first time I went, my friend was visiting and tried (real) haggis for the first time and said it was surprisingly good. I'm not sure if this is worth anything because he tends to only eat things that don't require utensils, and he ordered it as a challenge, expecting a monstrosity of organ parts, but still. It is an okay place to bring people if they want to try haggis cheap as there are filled rolls and what we got which were the bon bons. Not the best in the area, but not a commitment either if they don't like it.  Prices are as expected, and it's a convenient location as it's by the train and just off the Royal Mile. You could do worse, but I probably won't bother going back.",

    "text": "Southern Cross is the first place I think of for a quickish lunch with a friend before they have to catch the train. Just a little less than halfway down Cockburn Street, which winds colourfully toward the Market Street entrance to the station, it's ideally located and, inside, bigger than it looks.  I've been here a couple of times; on this most recent visit, I opted for the smoked salmon toast with cream cheese. It was really good, but - and I can't believe this is actually a criticism! - too much salmon. I are well over three quarters of it but by the time the toast and cheese were all gone, it began to be a little sickly just downing the salmon.  They have lots of cakes and things which (amazingly) I've not tried yet, but they look good. Be aware that they also will not split a bill for you. That seems totally weird to me; I understand it during the high visitor volumes of August since it can slow proceedings but on a regular day I don't see why they'd simply refuse...  Service is also variable. The first time I came, I had a delightfully charming young man who admired my brooch. This most recent time, the young lady was civil, but slightly curt. Nonetheless, the three of us got fed amply and had a drink each, and the bill came to 26, which really isn't bad in the Mile area.",

As you enter it looks like your usual coffee shop - some seating areas and a large blackboard over the till area with your menu and drinks - so there I was waiting to order at the till as you do. But turns out it's an actual restaurant which was a surprise to us as we were looking for something quick. But we decided to just stay as we were just starving!   We were taken to the upstairs level of the restaurant, which was nice as a lot of the decor and flooring was wooden so it felt a bit like you were in a tree house..   The staff and food was lovely, however it is probably on the pricey side considering it was a sort of coffee shop with a restaurant priced menu.   Overall was a good experience, will recommend :)",

    "text": "I only had one weekend in Edinburgh, so having a really good full Scottish breakfast was important. Looking through Yelp and TripAdvisor, we found the Southern Cross Cafe that had consistently good reviews and had a full Scottish and a veggie full Scottish (!!). We arrived just before they stopped serving breakfast (11:30am) and the waitress was so lovely and told us she'd get our orders in quickly so we didn't miss out. I ordered the veggie Scottish and my boyfriend had the Belt Buster (a full Scottish plus extra eggs, hash brown, meat etc). My veggie breakfast was really good. I had two eggs, a hash brown, veggie haggis (made of lentils, oats and some other things- I asked), toast, beans, mushrooms, tomato and a potato pancake thing. It was so nice to have such a good option as a veggie and I really enjoyed trying \"haggis\" for the first time. My boyfriend's breakfast was massive with everything I had plus sausage and bacon and real haggis. It doesn't sound like much more food on the menu, but it was massive. Probably better to order the normal size and get something afterwards if you're still hungry. I also had a latte with my breakfast, which was good, as was my boyfriend's filter coffee.   Overall, a great way to have started our weekend in Edinburgh with good food and nice service. Overall we paid around 25 or so (veggie breakfast is about 10, belt buster 12-13)",

The cappuccino I got was aesthetically pleasing but the espresso was weak and it was too milky/watered down.",

I got the blueberry stackers on one day, which were delicious though a bit too sweet. I think the outside of the pancakes were caramelized so they outside was extra sweet and crunchy and the inside was soft and chewy. Despite the fact that the sugar content was intense, I finished the whole thing because ultimately it was really tasty and filling.  On another day I got the ham and cheese croissant. I wasn't expecting it to be particularly filling, but I was wrong! Not only was it delicious, I didn't feel the need to eat afterwards for quite a while.  I would recommend this place to travelers and locals alike!",

Let me first say that the inside of this restaurant/cafe is super cute and I love their display of homemade pastries in the window. The menu has plenty of tasty-sounding options.  I liked the food a lot; I had the barbecue chicken wrap, while my girlfriend had the vegetarian breakfast. I had no complaints about either of these dishes, or the coffee.  What I did have a problem with was the service. The girl who greeted and seated us was nice enough, but our waitress was very unfriendly. She could barely muster a \"how are you\" when we sat down, and seemed completely disinterested in providing a friendly, warm cafe environment. It was difficult to get her attention for tap water, let alone anything else, though she seemed able to pay lots of attention to her boyfriend/partner who also appeared to work there.  It's not a bad place to grab a bite, and the food is yummy enough. Just don't expect great, prompt service or a smile when you come here.",

Three and a half years ago, my family and I visited Edinburgh for the first time and happened upon the Southern Cross Cafe for breakfast our morning. The cute decor, wonderful staff, and amazing food ensured a return visit our second morning - which we almost never do since we usually opt to try new places when we travel.   Fast forward to this year, I went back to Edinburgh with friends. I somehow tracked this place down, and it didn't disappoint. The decor was the same, the food and coffee as delicious. The staff had changed, but they were even friendlier!   Between my two friends and I, we split the Big Belter, not knowing what we were getting ourselves into. Suffice to say, we probably left a third of the plate behind despite stuffing ourselves beyond our limits!   Basically, go!! I'll be spending my mornings here any time I visit this city (:",

The walls and interior is wooden and gives this place a cozy feel especially with the christmas lights hanging from the ceiling. I ordered an Americano and scone with cream and blackberry jam. One of the best scone and cream combination I ever ate. The personell is very friendly and fast service even at busy times. I will be back.",

Inside the cafe there is seating on the lower level, as well as an upper level, so a lot of people can fit into the tiny space. For the price portions were quite generous and filled us up for a day of exploring the city. Absolutely delicious!",

The Eggs Royale I ordered was absolutely delicious, and my husband loved his Scottish breakfast as well. I was only sad that I didn't have room for one of the amazing looking pastries in the window. The atmosphere was cozy and warm, everything you want in a breakfast spot. My only complaint is that the staff was not very attentive - we stood in the entry awkwardly for quite a while before anyone even acknowledged us, and our plain coffees came out well after we got our food. Still, we would definitely go again.",

    "text": "The Southern Cross cafe is mainly visited by tourists, but I am quite a fan myself. It has good food and friendly staff. I think it has been refurbished recently too as it looked a lot sleeker than it used to today.  After leaving the Apple Store, we decided to come here for breakfast as it was just across Waverley Bridge. We were seated immediately and ordered our food.  The drinks arrived fairly quickly but the food did take about 20 minutes. It was a bit slow although they were quite busy with their breakfast rush. It was worth the wait though as the food was delicious.  I opted for the blueberry pancakes with cream and syrup and they were some of the best that I've had! I am quite the pancake connoisseur, if you didn't know.  Another thing I like about SX is it's central location - up the hill from Princes Street and down the hill from the Royal Mile. Don't bother with the Starbucks up the road. Instead, come here. It is more expensive but it is nicer and has a cute personal touch.",

It came with a fried egg which was cooked perfectly, sausage, bacon, mushrooms, tomato, toast, tattie scone and haggis. The whole meal was delicious! I personally am not a fan of haggis, definitely an acquired taste. The meal was filling and wasn't overly expensive. It was about 45 for four people.   When looking for breakfast in Edinburgh, this is a good stop!",

The toast was store-bought, the bacon was dry, the haggis was the end of the tube, the egg was fried hard, and the hollandiase sauce had no acidity. The mushrooms and  beans were good, and the inside  was cool, but I wish we'd gone elsewhere.",

I got a traditional vegetarian Scottish breakfast, with beans, eggs, toast, hashbrowns, mushrooms, tomatoes, and veggie haggis. Honestly, the authentic haggis was much better and surprisingly delicious, so I would recommend getting the traditional breakfast. The ambiance of the cafe is also great, but the top floor is pretty cramped - we had to scoot our chairs uncomfortably close to the table about five times during the meal so the waiter and other customers could get by.",

I was concerned about the quality of service from some of the other reviews, but it proved not to be True during our stay.   As for food, it was very good. Ordered the Scottish Breakfast and wasn't disappointed. The haggis really was the best thing on the plate. Also did an add on if the salmon and the black pudding and both were also delicious.   The entire family of four ate well, drinks and all totaling 45 before gratuity. As we ate late, this will be a brunch and will definitely hold us over until dinner.",
