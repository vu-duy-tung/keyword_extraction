    "text": "I feel the ratings and reviews for Eatalias so far are a bit skewed and unfair. Most reviewers had the pasta dishes, and while I do agree that the price is a bit high for pasta take-away (versus sitting in at Vittoria right beside Eatalias) I'm not sure the establishment deserves to be marked down for that. Especially since you have the choice to go elsewhere rather than pay that price for pasta. Nonetheless, everyone is very well entitled to rate on what is important to them.   For myself (and 7 year old son) we like the pizza. Scratch that, we loooove the pizza. I've never ordered the pasta and have very rarely tried the chips (think they were a tad soggy the last time) but this review will be just on the pizza and service, which I think both are great!  Eatalias is practically on my doorstep and I've been going here every other week for 4 years. They've certainly earned my patronage as they are always warm and welcoming when we come in. They are a family run establishment and are just always so cheerful and ready to ask my son how he's doing. We never order big, as it's just the two of us, but that never detracts from the service we get.   Prices - very good. We order a 12\" or 16\" half margarita half pepperoni which is always between 8- 12. In my opinion this is very well priced considering Dominos or Pizza Hut always end up being around 20 for the same. Maybe is because we go in to get it but even so.  Quality - I've never been disappointed by a pizza here. The crust is a thin Italian base and they always use fresh ingredients. I personally do not enjoy thick crust pizza so it's to my tastes. Sometimes more cheese and less sauce is needed but after 4 years and that's my only complaint. I love many of their other pizzas with some delicious toppings (sadly the boy doesn't like veggies on a pizza!) and even better some super spicy ones.   All in all I'll continue to get my bi-weekly Friday night pizza from here...until I move perhaps. Perhaps not!   I would say you wouldn't be disappointed by ordering a pizza here, but everyone has a particular taste for pizza. But it's far better than Dominos or Pizza Hut!!!  PS - they have Gluten free crusts now and I believe they are part of Taste of Italy.",

    "text": "I'm not quite sure how to rate Eatalia's. I feel like a 3 is generous, but 2 feels a bit mean. I was disappointed though...  I lived opposite the wonderful, and sadly no longer existent, Marcella's in Tollcross for two years and would frequently pop by for a takeaway pasta dish which tasted wonderful and was only 3. Last night I really wanted pasta, but was going to get back late from work with no time to cook. How I wished for a Marcella's in Leith! Then I remembered Eatalia's.  I'd never been but it was on my way home so thought I'd give it a go.  The plus points: Pretty good and varied menu, and the service was friendly.   Bad points..: I missed my bus because the food took longer to arrive than I'd been led to believe. The prices are too high (6.80 for takeaway lasagna?!). And the food itself was really nothing to write home about. The lasagna was disappointing - far too much mozarella on the top and far too little ragu. And way to heavy on the oregano. I love lasagna but I won't be ordering that again. The garlic bread was average.    I might be back, and if so I'll try another pasta (most of which are around the 5.50 mark,  still expensive but not as bad), but only if I'm really craving pasta and have no time to cook from scratch.",

    "text": "discovering a place nearby my flat that did good quality italian food to take away was quite a find.  luckily even though i've moved from that flat, i've never moved far from the area and still use eatalia's when i'm in need of a healthier type of take away from dinner.  i've gotten a variety of their pastas over the years and have to say that they are all good quality.  the al pomodoro with penne pasta is a favourite as it's freshy made tomato sauce with fresh basil and because there is no cheese or cream i like to think this is a fairly healthy choice.  i've also had the al sorrentino sauce with gnocchi which is very tasty but a bit heavy and something i tend to treat myself to on a rare occassion.  i had their spaghetti cabonara once and it was only ok, the sauce was lacking the taste of parmesan cheese and was rather thin.  their garlic bread is decent although i feel like it could use a bit more butter.    i can't comment on any of their other food as i've never gotten anything besides the pasta, but as they seem to do a good business with pizza and fish and chip suppers this must be of a good quality.  so why three stars, well it's the price.  when i first started going here the pasta was about 4 which was pretty reasonable since it had quality ingredients and was made fresh.  it's since gone up to over 5 with most coming in around 6 or more.  add in a few slices of garlic bread and the total dinner is about 10 which means i could probably have had the same dinner at a restaurant.  so while this place does good food, i'm not sure that it warrants the price attached.  after all this is a takeaway not a dine in restaurant, so i really feel like the prices should be more reasonable.",

    "text": "It's a refreshing change to see a chippy style takeaway which serves fast food at a great quality standard. This place fits that description perfectly.   I had a portion of Al Pollo pasta and it was absolutely delicious. My only problem is I don't think you can fully enjoy a pasta dish unless you are sitting down eating it out a big bowl with plenty of pepper and parmesan on hand, but a takeaway from here would be a great idea for a dinner party if you wanted to cheat a little!",

    "text": "Eatalia's is a great Italian takeaway on Leith Walk which offers good, filling and tasty portions at reasonable prices.  The service is pleasant and the place feels inviting with a well laid out menu.  They don't just do the predictable pizzas and pasta dishes, but also some fancy sounding ciabatta dishes, as well as the British classics of fish and chips and smoked sausages.  The whole concept of getting pasta from a takeaway seems kind of wierd to me, I'm sure it would be great but it's more restaurant food.  I went for their twelve inch 'hot spicy' pizza which cost about 8.50.  It was delicious (and hot) with pepperoni, spicy beef and flaming hot green chillies.  Most of the pizzas were around the 10 mark, but if they taste as good as the one I had then I whole-heartedly recommend them.   Eatalia's isn't the cheapest takeaway, yet it offers a great quality and original alternative to the other standard chippies in the area.",

For mains, Rughetta & Parmagiano Pizza. It can't tell you how nice it was, the crust was thin and the mozzarella was fresh. I ordered the 10 inch but it was more like 14. Amazing!  I picked up some ice cream for desert, here is my only gripe. A 500ml tub was nearly 5. Go to the Tesco down the street where Ben & Jerrys is usually on sale for half that.  Near Perfect!",

    "text": "Again, it's a divided review. My partner and I patronised Eatalias' delivery service for years when we lived in Leith. However, about a year before we moved away, we gave up in despair for several reasons.   We liked being able to order over the internet, but there were too many problems with that. The most frequent was that the website would just have issues and not be able to take our order. As the point was to not have to call anyone, we just wouldn't order then.   Once an order was placed, problems continued. We would specify exactly what we wanted in the comments box as it was very important the order was right, otherwise the meal couldn't be eaten. Fifty/fifty if it actually arrived that way. Several times we had to call up and complain, which defeated the whole point of ordering over the internet and getting food in to have quietly.   Finally, and this was the final straw, they started instituting a delivery charge on all orders, but failed to have this added to the website. Several times we got asked for extra money for the delivery, which didn't please us as the website had tallied everything and told us we had no charge. A couple of times it was waived, but when it was never fixed, we just stopped ordering.   So, when the food was right, it was very nice, but when it was wrong, it was a hassle and a pain to sort out.",
