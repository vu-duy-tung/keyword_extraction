I'd say the quality has gone down slightly simply through the professionals that ran the place 10 years ago handing the reigns down to their proteges. But that isn't to say the customer service has done the same, the guys are as well-mannered as ever.  Clamshell still delivers decent chips and battered goods. But they don't come to mind when I think of freshness. They are there to satiate that 2:30am craving, which they do well and at decent prices.  A good option for a quick stodge fix on the Royal Mile. But if you could be bothered, there is better about.",

    "text": "I first encountered Clamshell when returning home after a long night out on the Cowgate.  I saw two guys eating out of the plastic boxes associated with chippies.  I asked them where they got them from and they directed me to Clamshell, assuring me it was the best chip shop in Edinburgh.  I was sceptical but too hungry to challenge it.  I ordered a sauasage supper, devoured it all the way home and whole-heartedly agreed that it was the best chippy in Edinburgh.   I have since been back in a more sober disposition and I still think it makes some of the best chips I've tasted.  Being on the Royal Mile, however, it is quite expensive with battered sauasage and haggis suppers costing around 3-4 and fish suppers being over 5.  It is worth it though as the service is great and the quality is truly amazing.",

    "text": "Clam Shell, cloistered up between posh Scottish eating establishments and continental cafes, is a good old fashioned chip shop to satisfy your fast food cravings.  As far as food quality goes it's a higher standard of takeaway, and a winner in the fast food arena. Specialising in massive pizzas and succulent chippy chips, Clam Shell was always the first port of call when I visited Edinburgh as a kid. I have many fond memories of sitting out in the rain, munching my way through a soggy paper bag full of the best chips I've ever tasted. Big, fat chips drowning in brown sauce suddenly made the weather a lot more bearable.  Years later, it's barely changed and still offers speedy service and yummy fish suppers. The piping hot chips from Clam are a great way to warm yourself up on a drizzly day. This place shouldn't be overlooked in favour of the surrounding fancier options because as far as chips go, they are top class.",

Since I've not eaten anything else that could've caused this, I'm having the sneaking suspicion that it's the chips.  While I was eating, I also found a couple of pieces of grit, I think sand, between my chips. Well, how did you find them, you might ask? By biting on them! EEK! Know that horrible crunchy sound your teeth make when there's sand between them? Not good eats. I have NO idea how this happened or what to think of this since I've only heard good things about this chippy.  But, .. I do think it's fair to warn my fellow Yelpers that 2.5 hours after eating their chips, I'm not feeling too well ....  This experience needs of course to be verified, just not by me,... maybe I'll ask someone else to take one for the team and order some chips.

But yes, this is one of those other places I have never had the pleasure of entering completely sober. I don't think I'd want to.   They do your chips and your chips and cheese and they'll deep-fry a Mars bar or two for you. Essentially, they do what every good takeaway should, i.e. line your stomach with grease so that you don't wake up with your head up your arse the next morning. And they do that pretty successfully.   During the day, it's full of Edinburgh's teenage goths. At night, it's full of drunks. It's a lively place, evidently. But it's only on your way home if you're walking up from New Town into Old Town. And since most sensible people live in Old Town, they have a pretty consistent clientele.",

By the time we arrived after a late landing and quick pub-hopping (where there was no food--not even crisps--to be had), they were out of everything except what looked like a haggis roll and a sad cheeseburger. I didn't want my first foray with haggis to be disappointing, so my partner and I split the sad cheeseburger.  The staff was a bit cranky and ready to clean up, but they popped the burger between over-inflated buns, retrieved some crispy fries from the vat, and squirted ketchup into a corner of the Styrofoam (!!) packaging.  What's notable about this burger is that the cheese (a bland whitish cheese, the color of the Styrofoam container it was in) oozes out of the fried meat when you bite into it. I was thankful that frying kills all things: I'm not sure this particular late-night snack had actual food elements in it, but I couldn't be picky at this hour.  The fries were fine, and we didn't leave the establishment smelling like grease, which was another bonus.  Note to self: stock up on food upon arrival at airport so you don't have to eat fried sadness again.",

I just had to!  I checked Yelp to find the closest Deep Fried Mars Bar from where I was on the Royal Mile and found Clamshell. It is a hole in the wall dive but who doesn't love a hole in the wall dive in a foreign country while looking for an artery clogging delicacy? I put on my glasses and saw it, Deep Fried Mars Bar! It was so on and I ordered one from the ever so friendly staff, one who called me his GF and hoped I would come back in. Ha! Flattery and non judging gets you everywhere especially when I was about to shamefully down a candy bar, battered and deep fried. I watched one of the workers open up a Mars Bar from the wrapper, do something and fry it. At least I know it was fresh! ;) Upon paying for my Mars Bar, I noticed a big grilled split hot dog being prepared. My eyes widened and I said \"I need one!\" so I ordered one. Just to gluttonize myself even more. I got the Mars Bar first and it was oily AF but what was I expecting? I photographed myself with it, opened it to see the inside and ATE IT!! I think this is the gooiest thing I have eaten in awhile and I made a total mess, thank god for the invention of napkins. After I ate my fried heart attack, my hot dog was ready. I opted for mustard because ketchup on a hot dog is no Bueno! Again, I photographed it and ATE IT! So good on a cold Edinburgh day.  So yes, four stars for this hole in the wall dive named Clamshell and their Deep Fried Mars Bar and giant grilled split hot dog. By the way, I walked back a couple miles to my hotel. I had to feel somewhat better for what I had just done.",

At 2.50 each, it was a small price to pay for warm gooey goodness.    There was a line when we went and the guy behind the counter was frantically trying to get the lunch rush orders out.  He was a little like the Soup Nazi with his yelling.  We ordered 6 fried Mars bars and paid right before they came out of the fryer.  Only 2 of 7 people were in line for these since our group decided not to overwhelm the shop but a long line of hungry people started to form behind us.  Once our bars were wrapped to go, we marched outside with our spoils.  Unwrapped, the bars are coated in a crispy fried batter and they are warm, melty, and chocolatey inside.  I shared mine with a friend and it was a delicious treat.  I wouldn't eat a whole one and still refuse to do so.  It was a novelty and it was cool to eat while in Scotland.",

When people come along to visit I make sure we pass clamshell, not just for the classic mars bar or other chocolate bar covered in batter but for everything else deep fried! I love the fact you can share a whole selection of deep fried food while on the mile from pizza to haggis and even a burger.   It always seems to be busy but the staff are efficient and calm and friendly as well. It gets the job done and deep fried food always tastes delicious! The prices are good, especially for the mile so I would recommend you pass by and grab one of everything!",

What a wonderful haddock and chips! Satisfying in just the way that only a good fish and chips can be. It wasn't too greasy or heavy, and the portion was just right.   Staff are really good-natured and lively, meaning your wait could well be an entertaining one. I'd definitely find myself here again!",

    "text": "Oh god! What else can you say about a place that offers you so much fried food, so late at night? I came here at the request of a few people we met at the bar, who basically insisted that we couldn't leave Scotland without having deep fried haggis. Being a lover of haggis, I complied. But deep fried haggis wasn't all Clamshell had to offer. The King Rib (the Scottish equivalent of the McRib, but without the sauce, and HUGE), a deep fried Mars bar, and that's actually just the tip of the iceberg.  This is really good drunk food, and will probably shave a few years off your life. But it's worth a try at least once. Bonus points: They serve Irn Bru, which is banned in the United States for containing ponceau, a chemical I used in lab for protein staining. It's like liquid Pixie Stix!",

    "text": "I did the deed. I finally did it. I ordered myself a deep fried Mars Bar!   It wasn't the overwhelmingly sickly mess I'd anticipated... it was molten, warm and comforting and the batter just provided a light crisp on the outside to hold this calorific creation together.  The Clamshell is a really cute little gem on the Royal Mile right near Edinburgh Castle with speedy, friendly service and if you're so way inclined, they will pretty much deep fry anything for you!  It's lucky I don't live in Scotland, because I'd commit the sin again and again! And I'd be sure to come back to the Clamshell to do it!

Though take care - the caloric value is off the scale, so I would split that order amongst 4 friends, whilst totally plastered.  At the time, I did enjoy the King Rib, but let me clarify: I don't think this is a place I would cruise in for lunch on a normal weekday. This is not a thing to be enjoyed more than once a month, tops.  Wash it all down with an Irn-Bru, though be careful: It isn't marketed in the USA because it contains a chemical considered carcinogenic by the FDA.  And, BTW, it tastes like shit. There, I said it. Sorry, Scotland. But your chip shops can stay.",
