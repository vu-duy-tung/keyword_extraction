This, I admit, is not especially Turkish but was nonetheless ok.  Coming with squirty cream (which I find a little tacky) and a spoon  I swiftly lapped it up. The coffee was average too and the saving grace was my lucky snag of the big comfy sofa immediately found upon entrance.  Reading from other reviews the Turkish food sounds pretty good, I'll stick with that next time.",

The food is mostly tasty Turkish dishes such as couscous, a Meze platter to share and various flat breads with cool salad sides with olives and yoghurt. So far, so healthy. The cafe is a great place to have coffee and a cake (a lovely selection of carrot cake, coffee cake, pastries and even cheesecake) but also guarantees a good value and good quality lunch. The coffee itself can be a bit hit or miss but consistently better than Starbucks (ugh). The staff are simply wonderful. My friends and I are always greeted by warm smiles and nice chat. They are always very accommodating and understand what to do (i.e. make room for my wheelchair). Service is swift and of the 8 or so times I've been there i've never had to wait long. Wheelchair access: There is level access into the cafe  no steps. The cafe itself is quite small but the staff alleviate this problem by moving furniture where need be. I don't think there's a disabled toilet.",

The hospitable staff reminded me of my visit to Istanbul a few years ago. The service is excellent. We popped in for a cup of coffee with my friend, he had the usual Americano coffee although I recommended him to try the Turkish one diverging into explanations about the secret way of its preparation, although I doubted they had the same equipment to prepare it there. I couldn't resist the apple tea and baklava, as they are my favourites. The tea was delicious, so was the baklava but I found it a bit dry, perhaps not one of the freshest in the shop. Certainly, I will go back there again.",

Having to go out for lunch every day makes me grumble but I'm glad Turquaz is close by.   Most folks claim that the busy places are the best, but the truth of that really depends on your needs. Personally I want to eat my lunch in peace, and Turquaz is moderately quiet at lunchtime, quiet enough to read your book while you eat. Their food won't blow your mind, but it's consistently good and a decent price.  My current favourite is their Mediterranean wrap. It's packed full of freshly grilled veggies with a side of savoury couscous and a salad. Their tomato soup is also a nice light snack if you're not too hungry.  I'll keep going back, at least until my office kitchen is ready.",

In general the food lacked the flavour and seasoning that makes Turkish food mount wateringly delectable.  The Turkish coffee was fabulous and the Baklava for dessert was excellent :-) I would come back here again if I am craving for food but their service and flavoring does need a bit of a face lift to get this place humming.   The staff were very accommodating however they just did not come by to check on you unless you asked. It's not expensive so I suppose I should not expect a lot however I do believe a change might lead to a world of good for this place and make it super popular.   If you find yourself in Edinburgh city centre and craving for Turkish food besides a doner kebab then this place is not a bad bet.",

We were a group of three in for brunch, and the food sadly disappointed. I had pancakes with bacon, both elements of which were very poor. Pancakes were badly burnt on one side, rendering them almost inedible. Bacon also excessively crispy. My friend found his French toast just okay.  Service was pretty good- no complaints there. However, for the quality on offer, the price is too high. I will come back again in future for cakes again. I do hope things are better on that occasion.",

The waitresses' were lovely, the food was quick and yummy ( I strongly suggest the pancakes with bacon (and ask for fried eggs with it/instead of bacon is a veggie) so good!   Tip- I'd steer clear of their scrambled eggs. They lack flavour and are watery.   I also has a Berry Blast Smoothie. Very yummy. Very fresh. All in all the best place I've eaten in Edinburgh.",

Our favorite snack places around campus were all closed so we took a little stroll to Nicholson Street and got stranded at Cafe Turquaz.  I've walked by this place but was never particularly attracted but taking a closer look it did look welcoming and having no alternatives at hands we entered the cafe.  Now, I am prejudiced towards Turkish food and coffee ... which means I was looking forward to it :)  and we were not let down. Its a nice little place which could be a bit prettier but makes the most out of it's situation on Nicholson St, we sat in the far back and could forget about the busy street.  The food was just what we had been looking for, we had lamb shish kebab and a vegetarian moussaka. So it seems to be a good place for vegetarians, too. I was sort of hoping the tea we ordered would come in traditional Turkish style in small glasses but it was the European pot and cup. But that was the only downer, really.  We'll definitely return for another lunch and this time not out of lack of other options :)",

    "text": "Having once had a nice piece of cake in Cafe Turquaz, I was looking forward to returning tonight.  We were not an easy group; they had very kindly reserved us some space at the back of the long, narrow seating area but as we expanded in number we became harder and harder to fit in. Eventually the very friendly staff member suggested a lengthways rearrangement of the tables, which did the trick very nicely. It was really kind of them to accommodate our hassle!  It's a sweet little spot, quite dark (as I remembered) and with teeny weeny Turkish rugs the size of mouse mats on the walls. Cute! But unfortunately there's no real getting around a few issues.  The chap didn't seem to really know anything about gluten- free and it took poor Claire L a bit of word wrangling to work out what exactly she was ordering and whether it would suit. He wasn't forthcoming on volunteering a full description of the dish so it took a while. I think he was mostly just confused and caught off guard by an unexpected question.  I was excited by the offer of \"steamed milk with a flavour\", which has to be the nicest little thing I read on a menu. So nicely put! I opted for the honey one, but I'd really like to try it again because I was bemused by what tasted like basically just milk until I found all of the honey sitting at the bottom. I suppose it was my fault for not stirring it but steamed milk is so yummy and frothy I hadn't wanted to deflate it.  The food looked a little lacklustre and disappointing but I do remember having enjoyed the cake on my first visit, and the Turkish Delight this time was really nice, so I think I'll have to go back and try a third time. I suspect that their strengths lie in the sweet things. I'll update when I've been back and I imagine I shall add a star with the caveat that you come for the sweet side of the menu!",

The chicken was pre-packed and cut up so no sauce or seasoning issues. The corn chips were fine.

The baklava I had didn't seem the freshest or most tasty, but the nachos that others had looked completely underwhelming and left a bit to be desired.

Within minutes me and my girly-date where snug-as-a-bug all boothed up and happy. I could've sat there for ages just watching people pass by, or as we say in Dutch \"aapjes kijken\" which translates to \"little monkey watching\", (the rudeness of the term only being offset by the funness of the activity).

As the name suggests, the food here is largely Turkish. There is a huge selection of wraps/sandwiches and also soup on offer, but we opted for the Mezze platter to share (7.95) and definitely weren't disappointed. It came piled high with fresh humus, roast peppers, marinated olives, tangy feta cheese, stuffed vine leaves, artichokes, tzatziki to name a few... The flatbreads used to mop it all up had to come on a separate plate!  The range of flavours really was delicious; I love this type of turkish/mediterranean food and if you eat here you'll see why. My only word of warning would be it very much depends on who you're with - this type of lunch isn't exactly one you can eat neatly with a knife and fork!  We had trouble choosing from the wide selection of herbal teas available, but eventually went for the spiced apple which I'd highly recommend. The coffee was tasty but I'd stay away if you're planning on sleeping in the next 24 hours... it's definitely on the strong side!  My only criticism would be that a lot of the cakes/desserts on display weren't home-made. That said, whether or not the baklava was home-made or bought in I don't know, but it's definitely worth tucking into after your mezze.",

I had an awful experience here, and all the five star reviews in the world really wouldnt do much to persuade me to come back.  The Cafe was empty when me and my girlfriend arrived, which for a sunny saturday afternoon was somewhat odd. As we entered, the members of staff who were clearly using the cafe as a private members club for themselves instantly threw us cold looks, as though we had no right to be there and then dissapeared out of view for the next five minutes. At this point, my girlfriend and I wanted to leave, because without saying a thing the staff had been rude beyond belief.  When the staff did reappear, they did thier best to ignore us as they took our order of what I felt to be over priced Turkish food. When it did arrive it was slammed down onto the table, and regrettably wasnt even very nice at all. Further more, the fruit smoothy that I had ordered was worryingly thick and disgusting, and I took no more than a few sips before I left it. We paid and left within 20 mins of entering, with half our food untouched.  Looking at the previous reviews, I can understand that we may have just entered on a bad day where all the staff were ill or something, but really, it should have been better than that.",

    "text": "after a rather chilly cup of tea at looking glass books, Lou V. and I made our way over to this little turkish cafe to have some lunch in what we hoped would be a warmer location.  the misty rain and wind added to our cold but thankfully when we opened the door to this cafe we were welcomed with a rush of cosy warm air and a very friendly waitress that placed us at a table with menus.  a rather quick look at the drinks portion of the menu and i immediately opted for a turkish apple tea!!  oh i so love this beverage, it's such a fruity and apple-y cup of comfort that seems to only ever be available in tiny turkish cafes even though it's just a blend of tea placed in a normal tea bag.  why is this not sold in any shops????  Lou went for the turkish coffee option that was very expertly poured from a height into a tiny little cup (almost a thimble) that then had a little silver cover placed on top to keep it warm.  she very kindly allowed me to try a sip and i was pleasantely surprised by how nice this coffee was.  it was very strong, but in turkish style it was also nicely sweetened to take the edge off.  i may have to come back and order this for myself!  we both ordered the falafel plate for our lunch which came shortly after our drinks.  this was a massive plate totally filled with food but not to the point that it was unappetising.  there was a good portion of hummus toped with an olive in the middle, along that sat three tasty falafels, salad with a scrummy yogurt dressing, some roasted veggies, and a nicely shaped cylinder of couscous.  adorning the edges of the plate was a freshly toasted pita bread cut into four pieces.  lovely display and just as lovely tasting food.  the olives had been marinated so had a little chilli kick that i didn't expect, but the yogurt dressing on the salad helped to take the burn away.  in fact i wish i'd had more of the dressing as it was a very tasty topping for the falafels.  i also wish there had been a little bit more salad although the portion was probably balanced with the roasted veggies that were included.  i enjoyed dipping my pita bread into the hummus which was tasty but could have been just a tiny bit more garlicy, i also found the falafels to be tasty but just a tiny bit dry.  all in all though i really enjoyed my plate and felt it was only small things that could easily be remedied.  the service here is quick and effecient and it's so so so blissfuly warm inside this cafe!!  i really appreciated that after the cold shop i'd sat in before and was extra grateful when the waitress made a quick move to shut the front door after some obnxious customers left it open when they exited.  ugh why do people do that??? so rude... thank you to the waitress who fixed this so quickly i didn't even have time to get a annoyed comment out!  the only drawback to this place is it's near the university and not in a part of town i frequent.  but if i found myself back in newington, i'd happily pop in to try a turkish coffee and savour the warmth in cold winter months.",

    "text": "Went there last thursday with a friend and her 2-yr old son.  we had paninis and an ice cream , i also had a mango smoothie ,   i had spicy chicken panini with mozzarella , it looked delicious , but i was a bit disappointed that the mozzarella was not 100% melting ! and the chicken was not really that spicy! the panini came with slices of cucumber , tomatoes , olives , a bit of spiced up couscous, and a weird (not so fresh and rather old) red sauce. on the side . my chicken had chewy pieces of chicken which shocked me really!   but all in all it was ok, we also got strange looks form the man who was erving us ( looked like the owner) because of the kid was laughing loudly! He made u feel uncomfortable , like he was saying oh please leave soon!   smoothie was ok !",

I grabbed the most disappointing and pathetic looking bagel of my life out of here, 3.65 for something the size of a cheerio!  The cake that followed was superb though, a lovely rich chocolate slice! The coffee is ok, just ok.",
