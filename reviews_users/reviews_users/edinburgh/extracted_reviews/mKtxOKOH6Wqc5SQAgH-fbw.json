A no nonsense range of that sort of thing (along with a couple of burger options and some sweet ones) is served in a fuss-free environment. Side serves of sweet potato fries & other stuff are available but you may struggle to finish the chips yourself, given the filling nature of the sandwiches.  No toilet so make sure to go before you visit.",

    "text": "If you're on a diet - the route along Bruntsfield place just got even more dangerous!  First there was artisan chocolate, then cupcakes, cheesecakes and now MELTMONGERS!  I seriously may have to consider moving to Bruntsfield as this seems to be mecca for gourmet goodies in Edinburgh.    I first spotted a Meltmonger creation on Instagram.  I was scrolling along past pictures of cats, salads, juices, sunsets and BAM!  A toasty, gooey, cheesy, buttery sandwich stopped me in my tracks.  Surely this must be from a trendy, toasty only cafe in London.  I clicked the link and was ready to grab my coat when I saw that Meltmongers was in Edinburgh!  After one visit, my hubby and I are ready to declare Meltmongers our lunchtime favourite.  I love when people stick to what they know best - and that's just what Meltmongers do - a simple menu - done well.  3 breads - soft white, bloomer and sourdough; and a good selection of cheesey combos.  We went for the classic (cheddar and american) and the smokey chilli (smoked applewood cheddar and jalepenos), both on sourdough.  And of course a side of sweet potato fries.    There are only a few 'tables' and a counter in the window.  There is some empty space in the centre and as demand grows (which it will!) I'm more seating will appear. You can also take away.    It wasn't long before we were tucking into our tasty toasties.  Generously buttered (I hate when the outside edges are left dry), toasted to perfection and every bit of cheese melted and oozing.  Seriously good!  And the best sweet potato fries ever!  The last ones I tried at a burger joint were greasy and rubbery.  Not these!  They were thin, crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside.  My husband doesn't usually go for 'fancy chips'' but he ate more than I did!  But, the single portion was plenty for both of us.  This place was love at first sight but still a tiny bit of room for improvement.  I enjoyed the sourdough, but  I really love toasties on granary bread - when the bits go all crunchy and nutty, but there was no 'brown' option at all.  My hubby didn't have to share his toasty with me;  I love jalepenos but not smoked cheese - I'm sure that you could ask for changes to the set menu, but would like it to be more obvious.  Maybe they could list optional extras and types of cheeses available on the menu; making it easier  to create custom toasties (like a gruyere and garlic mushroom - hint hint) And introduce some more interesting cheeses - maybe as a daily special; like comte, or a blue.  Although, I'd be perfectly happy to eat that classic toasty every day.....  ps.  I nearly forgot - they do sweet toasties too!  Peanut butter and banana (I used to make peanut butter and cream cheese toasties - warm peanut butter is sooo good!) and marshmallow, nuttella and banana.  This could get dangerous! And according to my hubby the coffee was great too!",

    "text": "Like Caz and Emily, I was a bit disappointed with what I experienced.  Nothing wrong with service or the interior.  The toastie wasn't a toastie.  The bottom half was let's say mushy and greasy, and it was a little difficult to eat as it had no sturdiness of a toastie.  Don't get me wrong the filling was nice and it was packed too.  I ordered The Big Cheese:  Mature cheddar, American and gruyere with sweet tomato and chilli chutney and expected a little more hit in the way of chilli.  Another downside was the fact that both of the sauces on the tables were more or less finished and desperately needed to be renewed and cleaned.  It's not going to get me to do a hasty return.  I know better places in Bruntsfield that I'm prepared to part with my hard earned cash too.  Yes one Napkin, what's that about?  Seriously dudes the grilled sandwich is greasy. We customers need more napkins!",

Bleary eyed this morning with no intention of cooking I walked down to this new sandwich shop. 10 minutes later I'm eating the best hangover cure I have had yet.   It's huge, greasy and doesn't have cheap ingredients. My only mistake was not getting some sauce with it.",

    "text": "I'd heard good things, I'd read the reviews, I'd seen the pictures on social media.. It was with much anticipation that I ventured to Meltmongers for a cheese toastie!   The space is well utilised with tall stools and tables along the walls with a small window perch and a large window letting in natural light to help make the room feel very spacious.  I opted to splash out for the grilled chicken and my companion assured me that not only was lemon mayo not strange warm, that it was freaking delicious! Well then, sign me up! We had planned on splitting the sweet potato fries and 'mashed potato bacon cheese melts' only to be told, these had been taken off the menu. (That's fine, they're new, they're still tweaking the menu, I get it.)  Our sandwiches arrived and they looked great! I took my first bite, the chicken's a bit dry.. Nevermind, once I get to some lemon mayo, it'll balance it out.. I take bites two and three... where's this amazing lemon mayo?? I'm just not tasting it.. I try bites four and five.. uhhhhh... these bits of chicken are burnt and now all I can taste is burnt, but I soldier on in the hopes of finding a pocket of this amazing lemon mayo... I get through the first half of the sandwich and begin to think this lemon mayo may just be a mirage!  Meanwhile we have been chatting and laughing and I have been munching sweet potato fries... I get to my second half of the sandwich.. it's cold and the cheese is no longer melty and stringy like in all those social media photos.. it's starting to congeal.. Maybe some of that chilli relish will help matters..?? Except the person before has made a total mess of the bottle cap and now I have a sticky hand and still no relish for my sandwich.   I ask for more napkins. We get given two. Come on dude.. I'm a messy eater, I'm essentially a child.. you can be a leeettle more generous with the napkins..!! I've just given you 6.50 for a chicken and cheese sandwich and another 2.50 for a fancy soda, you can spare me a few napkins... Never fear! I travel with wet wipes in my bag for just these occasions! (I didn't spot a bathroom, so super glad I had these in my bag.)  I really wanted to like this place, I love small local businesses that are doing something different and who doesn't love a grilled cheese toastie?? In this instance, not me.   The fact that it's across town and I feel I could do better at home for a fraction of the cost means I will not be making a hasty return.",

    "text": "Meltmongers is a really good wee addition to the Bruntsfield scene. It was an ideal meet up for me and Baby Yelp as it has loads of space for buggy parking and it was a speedy hot meal.   I opted for the chicken and cheese toasty. It was mostly quite good though had an unusual flavour in a few bites that my head translated to potentially not fresh. I'm sure it was just seasoning though and the tasty jalapeno relish was just the ticket for it.  Like Caz I did find it all a bit less appealing when it cooled. For me it was the cold greasy bread that was a turn off. The toasties are fried in what was, to me, a rather too ample amount of oil/butter, which got a bit ick by the second half. This means that you're really best to eat in here and chow ASAP.  Nice setup though, speedy food at a decent (for the area) price.  Shame it gets heaving with school kids, though.",

    "text": "The mothership has landed! Last summer I was tempted to pack in my job and set up a grilled cheese concession somewhere.  It felt like the perfect mix of personal passion and gap in the Edinburgh street food market.  My personal passion for cheese toasties originated in childhood and had been reignited by Brick Lane's Grill My Cheese.  Of course I was too lazy to act and kept my fingers crossed someone would fill the niche. Et voila! Meltmongers of Bruntsfield. Super tasty toasties on a choice of breads. Burger toasties and sweet toasties (\"caramelt\" brownie and salted caramel). Great sides like sweet potato fries (best I've had in ages). Kids options.  Good coffee but other drinks too limited (fancy sodas).  The place is very new and clean with just a few seats, suited more for takeaway.  Bit rough round the edges as things settle. Definite revisiting rating once its settled down to see whether 5* is deserved. Cheese heaven.",
