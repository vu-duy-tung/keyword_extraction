Saw the menu at the Whiskey Experience and decided to try the Amber Restaurant. Downstairs (but there is an elevator) to a pub/restaurant. Nice servers, well presented meal. Not necessarily a huge menu choice, but enough for everybody's taste. Food arrived pretty quickly (nicely presented) and was tasty.  Must say however, for all restaurants in Scotland, getting more than one glass of cold water becomes a trial.",

I was impressed that they do have real ales in bottles and of course the whiskey selection is hard to beat. I'm pretty sure you'll need a reservation around lunch or dinnertime.  I suggest you come for tapas with whiskey pairings instead of a full meal.",

You enter the Heritage Centre and descend the stairs at the rear to find Amber. It's more 'laid-back bistro' than posh restaurant, yet it is smart and has a relaxing ambience; a perfect combination if you enjoy good food, but not a formal atmosphere.   Alongside the eating area is a cosy wee bar where they have a massive selection of whiskies for you to sample and, should you wish, be educated about. The bar is well stocked with non-whisky tipples too!   Some of the food at Amber (unsurprisingly) has a whisky theme, though the whisky never overpowers the food where it has been used. Haggis and Vegetarian Haggis comes with a whisky cream sauce which is divine. The meals are very well prepared and attractively presented. Desserts are also very impressive and the wine list has been very well put together and isn't overpriced. It's possible to eat very well and very cheaply at lunchtime. A real treat! Highly recommended by locals!",

In addition to the food, they have a fantastic array of whisky to tempt the tastebuds on a cold winter night and an expert on hand to guide you without making you feel daft for not knowing your regions.

Our waiter was not very knowledgeable about the menu, however, and seemed distracted.  My husband had the Plaice (a kind of white fish) and found it bland, and the bread was very stale in the bread basket.  I had the salmon, which was supposed to have been accompanied by crab cakes or fritters. I was told some time after ordering that the crab cakes were being replaced by salmon cakes, which was a little disappointing but okay.  The salmon was fine, but would have liked crispier skin, but the salmon fritters were very rich and heavy inside; it tasted like smoked salmon drowning in this creamy, over-rich filling.  I couldn't eat it.  The one nice aspect of the meal was the whiskey I ordered. Very nice whiskey.  If you love whiskey this is the place to go for a tasting, but dinner was very disappointing, especially after having dined at Lovage the night before, which has an amazing chef.",

That doesn't mean its not very busy on any given day however. It draws in a certain amount of custom from visitors to the Scotch Whisky Experience and can be accessed via their reception area or a door at the rear of the attached Whisky Shop, then down the stairs. Its worth seeking out!   Amber has something of a cafe vibe and you can head in there for just a scone and coffee or something more substantial, like a full lunch with a glass of wine, or maybe something from their very reasonably prices whisky list! They offer advice on matching whisky with food. Nice idea! There is also a whisky tasting lounge alongside and plenty of experts on hand to dispense knowledge.  I had a scrumptious lunch of vegetarian haggis with neeps and tatties nicely finished off with a whisky cream sauce - there's a bit of a whisky theme going on but its not in everything! Apparently the smoked haddock was a bit special too, but lacked my lovely sauce. Cheese and crackers seemed like a good idea to end the meal, so I ordered the clava brie with oatcakes and plum chutney. It was quite pungent for a brie but the chutney helped balance the strong flavours. We left full and happy. Would recommend Amber if you are in that part of town.",

The main was beef filet with mushroom sauce, purple carrots and potato cake. I was not as impressed with the main. The beef and potatoes seemed to be dried out by a heat lamp. The dessert was a whisky chocolate pot and cream cake served with a dram of 12 years old Deanston whisky. The whisky pot was delectable while the cream cake was unmemorable. Dinner was finished with local goat cheese on oat cake, coffee and Scottish fudge. Overall the meal was good. I am sure it could have been sensational if it were not served banquet style.",

We immediately walked by Amber, thought the menu sounded interesting, and went in for a late lunch.  You wouldn't expect a restaurant in the Scotch Whisky Experience to be impressive, but this certainly is.  The room itself is beautiful and has a nice view out the windows.  Service is friendly and helpful.  My husband  had the lamb stovies and loved it.  I ordered the herb crusted coley, and it was one of the best things I've ever eaten.  The mussels and leeks were done perfectly, the dumplings were outstanding, and the sauce was to die for.  We liked the restaurant so much we came back the next day for the Platinum Tour (another future review) and the Taste of Scotland.  Again, this showed how amazing Scottish food really is-- who knew?  The tapas included a scallop, smoked salmon, and black pudding (two for three here, but that's a matter of personal taste) and for entrees we got duck, lamb, and the coley.  The duck was delicious and not at all greasy.  The lamb was so tender you could cut it with a fork, and came with surprisingly good haggis potatoes.  For dessert we had a toffee cake paired with a whisky, and it was absolutely amazing.  The servers can give helpful reccomendations about whisky (as well as other drinks), and there's even a whisky sommelier should you need truly expert advice.  Prices are really fairly reasonable, and the Platinum Tour/Taste of Scotland is really a steal considering how much comes with the tour.  Definitely somewhere you should go if you find yourself in Edinburgh.",

Highly recommend the whiskey tour. Starts out a bit cheesy with a ride through the distillation process, but it gets better. Better description of the different whiskies than I have relieved before.  The whiskey collection was the best part of the tour. The gold tour comes with a good tasting at the end.   If your interested in scotch, it's a great place to start",

We only ordered the cheese plate which had of Scottish cheeses, a whiskey cocktail & a whiskey flight. It was a good portion of cheeses but the bread was pathetic. The bread looked like the same crap we get in the States -  white, light and tastless- and Scotland has better than this. 3 stars for the cheese board.  The bar tender was very good to listen to what we were looking for in drinks and had excellent suggestions.   The bar area was small but it had several bar stools for single travelers and sofas and comfy chairs in the seating areas for small groups and couples. The bar was brilliantly lit by the lovely Amber lights along the wall of whiskey and some natural light from 3 large windows.",

The prices are a little higher than average but it's pretty much what you would expect given the location.  Still pretty reasonable in my opinion.  We got the Plaice and Smoked Haddock (excellent),  Cullen Skink (meh), Lamb Stovie (good), and the tapas combo (meh).  The Scotch menu was excellent of course.  I got the Islay flight and literally the one Scotch I was most excited to try they said they were out of and wanted to replace with some cheaper non age denomination alternative.  After some back and forth it was replaced with another same age/value Scotch.    When I got the bill I actually saw that each of the drams were priced separately so I guess technically if I got the cheaper Scotch the total price would have just been lower.   This is not the pricing model i'm use to with flights but it definitely makes more sense!  Bottom line, not amazing but decent choice if you are in the area.",

    "text": "High reviews on Yelp and Trip Advisor? Near perfect ratings? Scottish TAPAS? Say what!?!   I had high expectations coming into the Amber Restaurant, especially since I tried to make reservations over a week in advance and there was only a 5:30 time slot left. This led me to believe that Amber was the legit place in Edinburgh for whiskey tastings and traditional Scottish fare... Eh, it was okay.   Imagine my surprise when we walked into a near empty restaurant on a Friday evening. Where were all of the diners? And whisky tasters? And workers? We stood awkwardly for a few minutes before being greeted. We were then led over to our table, nestled between the only three other occupied tables in the entire restaurant. And wouldn't you know it, all of the other diners were AMERICAN like us. Not another party walked into the restaurant the entire 2 hours we were there... on a Friday night ? What? Ugh, I felt like I had fallen for a tourist trap.   Amber touts itself on whiskey tastings and having a whiskey experience... tell me why Amber only has a total of FOUR cocktails to choose from and no readily available cocktail menu? Our server had to go \"hunt\" down the menu and I was a bit perplexed when she brought me the plastic menu stand that sits on top of the bar. Also, for bragging that the restaurant carries hundreds of whiskies, tell me why out of all of the flights for my husband to choose from, the one he finally settles on they are \"out\" of one of the selections and had to substitute with something else... What. The. Heck?  The Food: It was okay. I honestly was not blown away. I was a  little leery to indulge in the traditional haggis, so the haggis bon bon under the tapas portion of the menu sounded like the safe route to go. It was surprisingly really good. Lamb stovies were okay-- the potato chunks were quite large and I was not expecting stringy lamb, but whatever. The barley side was also good, but a little too cheesy for my taste. I actually felt hungry a few hours later. Kind of made me feel like we wasted a lot of money on a dinner that left us unsatisfied, both in taste and portion (yes, I know tapas are small but we had the 5 tapas, 3 pots, and an entree-- dang!).   Overall, the Amber Restaurant definitely fell short. It was not terrible, but definitely not amazing.",

Located right beneath the Edinburgh Castle ramparts, right off of the esplanade, is Amber Restaurant and Whiskey Bar. A lot of people obviously come for the whiskey tasting and the \"Scotch Whiskey Experience\". Yes, they have 400 whiskeys and they do an exceptional job of matching whiskey with their epic cheese selection, but don't get so drunk you can't enjoy eating off their menu!    Our starter was Four Scottish Cheeses from Iain Mellis (Edinburgh farmhouse and artisan cheesemonger) served with Amber Chutney. For the main course I had haggis with neeps and tatties in a whiskey sauce. Both were superb.   I'm dropping a star merely on philosophy: They constantly change their menu.  I know you have to change things up, but I believe consistency helps. It sucks to come back and not have those wonderful things I had before.",

The principle is quite simple: you tell the bartender the amount of money you are willing to pay and you will taste whisky according to his choice. Sure, you can choose your drink by yourself. But why not use the skills of a trained specialist, especially when he can talk about whisky in such a wonderful way:)   The restaurant/bar is underground, in large rooms suitable even for buying bottles. Clean toilets and very helpful staff - a customer can t ask for more :)   Vazne prima misto :) Hned pod hradem - myslim ten velky hrad na kopci - kde clovek muze zazit fantastickou whisky experience! Princip je vcelku jednoduchy: Reknete barmanovi castku penez a on vam podle ni da ochutnat whisky, ktere vam sam vybere. Jasne, muze si clovek podle napojoveho listku zvolit i sam. Ale proc nevyuzit schopnosti skoleneho odbornika, zvlast, kdyz o whisce umi i bajecne vypravet :)  Restaurace/bar je v podzemi, ve velkych prostorech vhodnych i pro nakup lahvi. Ciste toalety a velmi ochotny personal - co muze zakaznik chtit vic :)",

There was a choice of multiple whiskeys (which narrowed the choice from over 400 to under 10!), I chose one of the non smoky ones.  It was very smooth and light.  The tapas arrived around a small greens salad, which worked between to truly taste each tapa.  1.Venison sausage was lightly seasoned and had a slight sweetness to it.    2.The pork belly matched wonderfully with the chutney and was delightfully cooked, tender and full of flavor.  3.I wasn't sure what to expect of the vegetarian haggis, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I am not really sure how to describe the taste, but I enjoyed the taste.  4.The terrine of pressed ham was wonderful, though the relish on top of it was a bit pickley for my taste, but not so much that I didn't enjoy the taste.  5.To end I enjoyed the oatcake with smoked cheddar. I did decide to order the lamb stovies.  It was delivered in the cutest little black pot on a slate.  The warmth from this little dish just filled my soul.  Th mix of lamb, potato and onion was a lovely combination to end my meal before returning outside to a snowy Edinburgh street.",

    "text": "We didn't do the Whiskey Experience because we heard it wasn't great and there was no way we were going to wait on the line, so we figured that going to the bar downstairs would be the next best thing.   The bartender was very young but extremely knowledgable. He could tell you something about every bottle on the rack! He was also very nice and friendly, to boot.   We moved to the restaurant after our drinks where I had the speck in a creamy sauce with potatoes and leeks. It. Was. Delicious. And for the price, it couldn't be beat.   I'd definitely recommend going to Amber as an alternative to the WE, but also as an affordable lunch near the castle.",

Still a filling portion. I attached a picture of my sandwich. Def seems like a tourist place, but very good! If you make it up the hill, go here!",

    "text": "We had reservations for the \"Taste of Scotland\" dinner, which we tacked on to the end of the Whisky Experience Platinum Tour. They bundled everything - the tour and dinner - together into one ticket, which was nice.  After the experience tour was done, our guide escorted us down to the restaurant, where we had a bit of a wait while they had our table set to rights. The restaurant was pretty busy that night, which meant that it was kind of loud, especially right by the entrance, but they put us at a table kind of near the back, where it was quieter.  The tasting dinner consisted of a three course meal, with another sample of whisky at the end (in addition to the three samples we'd gotten on the tour).   The first course was a starter, which contained a small pot of haggis, neeps and tatties, cheese on toast and some chicken liver pate. This was our first time sampling haggis (it was on our list, of course, but we hadn't had an opportunity prior to this), and though there may have been a bit of trepidation to start, we were game to try.  I think the stigma of haggis keeps most people away. That, and the way it's most often described. But, it was actually very good. It has a bit of a mealy, grainy texture, but it was meaty and filling. Definitely not something I'd want to eat every day, as it was also a bit fatty, but I quickly realized there was never anything to be scared of.   The cheese and toast were very good - the cheese was herby, and it complimented the toast well. The pate was my least favorite on the dish - it had a very strong gizzard-like flavor that threw me.  The main course also consisted of three pieces: Scottish salmon over risotto, roasted lamb over tatties, and haggis-stuffed chicken over a sweet potato puree. Everything was tasty, but I think my favorite dish was the salmon over the risotto. The salmon was perfectly cooked, and surprised me by pairing well with the creamy risotto. The lamb was perfectly cooked. The haggis stuffing within the chicken breast made it fall apart when cutting into it, but that wasn't too much of an issue.  The dessert course was a chocolate hazelnut cake, which was paired with a Speyside whisky. Though the cake looked dense when it first got to us, it was actually very light - both in texture and in flavor. I love hazelnuts, so it was a perfect pairing for me, though it wasn't quite as nutty as I would have liked.  The service that night was decent - most of the staff was tied up with the large party I mentioned at the top of this review, so it took a bit of time for them to make their way to us. Everyone was friendly, at least, so that counts a lot.",

    "text": "When my wife booked this for my birthday, I brought out my \"jump to conclusions\" mat and figured this would be another expensive dinner in Edinburgh, 1) thanks to being in Edinburgh and 2) my belief that the Whisky Experience and Amber Restaurant were tourist traps.  However, I was pleasantly surprised and packed away my \"jump to conclusions\" mat for another time.  Drinks. The bartender couldn't have been a shade over 25, yet he had knowledge of whiskies beyond his years (and mine too).  I was interested in putting together a whisky sampler and sought his advice.  I told him the basics of what I was looking for and after a few more questions, he came back with four glasses of whisky (with the bottles), a glass of water, and a very detailed explanation as to the different whiskies, their regions, and what to look for.  It was a great addendum to the Whisky Experience tour.  Food. The food was excellent and was exactly what we were looking for to top off the Whisky Experience tour.  The Scottish tapas and fresh bread were a great start to the meal and were quickly followed up by our main course.  I went with the lamb pot with a side of roasted carrots; my wife had the same roasted pot with a side salad.  My two boys had bacon sandwiches, and after their food came, I wondered if I made a mistake and didn't get what they had! To top it off, the prices were very reasonable and nothing what I expected.  To break it down, here was our bill:  -2 kid bacon sandwiches -order of bread and butter -Scottish Tapas -2 lamb pots -side salad -side of roasted carrots -gin and tonic -5 whiskies (1 x Drambuie 15 yr and 4 x hand selected whisky tasting selections) -carafe of water  Our bill came to 64 pounds!  Now, after dropping 78 pounds at the Hard Rock Cafe and getting far less for my money, I was pleasantly surprised and was more than willing to spend the savings at the gift shop upstairs.  I'm pretty sure 6 x drinks at some other whisky bars in Edinburgh would probably set me back close to 60 pounds.   Finally, the service was above reproach.  Very pleasant, very attentive, and very willing to say \"I don't know, let me get the expert\".  When I asked about the whisky sampler, our waitress went and brought the bartender over to help me out.  To me, that's a True sign of a knowledgeably, attentive, yet humble staff.  Highly highly highly recommend anyone who comes to Edinburgh, take one of your dinners here at the Amber Restaurant.",
