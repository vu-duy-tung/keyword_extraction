    "text": "City Restaurant holds a fond place in my heart -- the best sit-in chippy I've found in Edinburgh with a great selection of... everything you could want from a greasy spoon, really! The breakfasts are HUGE and great value for money -- you can change the selection and swap your haggis for mushrooms if you can't handle it first thing in the morning, or whatever -- there's also a veggie option. Then there's the usual \"+chips\" options with everything from fish to haggis to deep fried pizza. However, you can also get more 'normal' stuff like a HUGE plate of pasta, a healthy baked potato with a big choice of fillings, a salad or a filled roll. The atmosphere is quite nice though very informal -- great for people watching as you really get all sorts in there. Best thing about it is the service though -- the place is INCREDIBLY busy but the lovely waitresses (who are mostly Polish but all with very good English and always a big smile) are always happy to help and very friendly -- service is amazingly quick too. Good prices, and they stay open late. Love it!",

The food isnt anything special, whether you sit in to enjoy what you have ordered, or take it out. However, the food is tasty, and the portions are huge - the price isnt bad either. The restaurant itself looks a bit 80's - but really, thats not a huge concern unless you were expecting 5 star kinda stuff. Staff seem to be friendly, even late at night when the restaurants main custom is drunken students, but during the day they are always nice.  This place is great if al;l you want is a hearty meal at a cheap price.",

Their quarterpounder with cheese has saved my -academic- life several times, and I'm never disappointed by the quality of the meat either. It's perfect for that weekend grease run I always find myself doing.  How do I know the food is good in this particular greasy spoon? Well, I've got a very, very sensitive stomach, and if anything was awry, believe me, I would've known by now.  The only thing I've got to grumble about (I'm always grumbling about something aren't I?) is the mayonnaise, it's too vinegary. I don't really like it that much. But hey, I'm Dutch and we like our mayo, (no doubt about that). If you like your chips like you like your spoons (that is greasssy) this here'll do for you!  P.s. No whining about health now, I left my arteries at home, they don't have to know about this.",

Stumbled upon this place which at first looked like a chippy posing as a restaurant but I soon learned it was more the other way around.  Excellent table service, warm inviting interior, licensed, with a thoroughly broad menu for what I thought to be a chippy. Pasta dishes, grill, epic all day breakfasts and of course battered fish to name just a few highlights.  I went for my usual fish and chips which was gorgeous, crispy batter with flaky haddock and no sign of grease. Slightly overpriced but I all things considered I won't argue. My missus went for a pasta dish which she couldn't finish which is a first. Happy faces all round.  Busy wee place, especially the takeaway.   Good vibes from here, would like to go back when I'm not in a hurry and maybe sit upstairs out the way of the queues of folk getting takeaway and the stares from street prowlers glaring in the window!",

I guarantee you'll enjoy eating at this place, but make sure you've sent off to China for your donor heart before hand, cuz you'll be needing a new one.  On my one and only visit I got a deep fried pizza which I chewed on in the company of two JF's. They, being PHD students, probably viewed me with utter contempt, and were only there with me to conduct a study into socially inept and underdeveloped human beings. As a result I ate with a reasonable degree of dignity in an effort not to draw too much attention to myself. Had I been dining alone, my behaviour would have been distinctly less muted, and I would have wrung the doughy treat out into my mouth like a tea towel saturated with pizza flavoured fat. Then with more enthusiasm than a Romanian prostitute who had just realised she could earn a Leu and get something warm in her belly at the same time, I would have sucked the oily dregs from its limp remains, and given thanks for the privilege.

The best thing about City Restaurant, is that they always serve you very generous portions, which sometimes I struggle to actually finish, and I normally can put my food away.  It's a multi purpose restaurant, in that no matter what time of the day you go there, there is something on offer, in the morning they do a breakfast, for lunch there are baked potatoes and in the evening, fish and chips. Not that I would recommend this diet, but the fact that it's always an option is great.",

Giving this a 4 star mainly because the waitress was so sweet. She made sure we were never low on water. She gave us all take out boxes and packed extra tartar sauce in small containers for each of us. Didn't expect such good service at a fast food place.",

    "text": "We've eaten here for dinner a few times since coming to Edinburgh, so I can only really comment on it as a restaurant rather than as a chippy.  City's diner aesthetic gives it a bit of character compared to the other restaurants in the vicinity, with it's bold colour scheme. We decided to give it a shot on this first impression as it stood out from the drab buildings that occupy most of that street. At first we grabbed a corner table, but the seats near the window do allow for a great deal of people watching if that takes your fancy. We also found the staff there pretty friendly and chatty, which also made for a nice relaxed atmosphere.  Each time we've visited we've had a good meal, their chip shop chips are great and more flavourful than the regular chips you might get from another restaurant, which was a nice change. Each time we've been we've tried different meals and combinations and never been disappointed.   Price-wise it's about average, getting a bit pricey if you really want a steak, though you can have a good meal from 10-20 with drinks, which is decent value. I'd also recommend their cake of the moment as it's a bit cheaper and they normally have really nice cakes on offer.",

Pop in for cylindrical cakes, rhomboid sands., and triangular zas. It's food to get you in shape.

So if you fancy a breakfast or chips and want to escape the cold City Restaurant is fairly pleasant.  Why 3 stars, well the issue I have is that it is a bit more expensive than the other chip shops nearby, but the food is of no better quality, heck most of it tastes the same because it is likely from the same supplier...   The quarter pounder, mince pie, sausage etc are identical to those found in Central Takeaway, I bring this up because at lunch time Central do a takeaway offer which means a selection of dishes only cost a couple of pounds (and in my opinion they do better chips).  In short City Restaurant is fine-to-good if you want somewhere to sit and chat while getting your fried food fix, otherwise there are better options.",

Sure, there is no sea right outside the restaurant, but the chips are chunky and flavoursome (for potatoes).   Portions come in small or large, the former costing 1.60, the latter 2.20. I go or the small portion which is rather generous. There are off times, and it seems as though the chips are at their best around 12 and 5. Extras include curry, mushy peas and cheese. On ordering, you can ask for brown sauce, salt, vinegar and mustard.   The chips are cooked in vegetable oil, which is a plus for me, being veggie and also quite health conscious. I cannot really say anything about the other food, as I have only ever come here for chips, but the fish and chips are a steal at 4.50.   The premises is clean, modern and in a very central location, close to festival theatre, he national museum of Scotland,  the University of Edinburgh and Surgeons' hall.",

I don't like all these places around Edinburgh trying to lure the unknowing tourists in with there menu slogans of 'True traditional homemade Scottish food' and what you get has Farmfood written all over it. At City Restaurant you know from the moment you see the very american road side dinner style that I'm gonna get fast food nutrition.   So far there is nothing in my words written, that explains why one would want to dine her. Well simply I just really like  now and then after a long rainy grey day to sit down in a place where one can put yer feet up, whistle a tune, put my elbow right on the table and hand pushing my face to the side, fork in the other and just eat with out any one giving a damn about my manners. So if you seek this look no further.   My rating of three stars? Well first of all any processed food just can't get more then an OK. The only thing that differs a one, two and three is the size of the burger and City Restaurant isn't short on size here. 8.99 for the City burger big enough to hide my face with, plenty of onion rings and chips.  Simply shitlicious!!",

I don't think I'm talking out of turn when I suggest that that was a long time ago.  It looks like a sort of upmarket chippy, with loads of comfy booths. Almost like an American diner, an impression reinforced by the friendly table service. And it's a lot bigger than it appears, with additional seating on the first floor.  They do a long list of British greasy spoon standards, but with less of the greasy. I had an omelette and it was deliciously light and fluffy, and a great deal too. Three-egg omelette with choice of filling, served with chips and peas, for 5.95. Washed down with a cold bottle of Caley 80, it was the perfect lunch.  Next time I'm out and about in this part of town and looking for a cheap tasty meal, I won't hesitate to come back here.",

The batter was more like soggy skin, the chips were pretty \"Meh\" and you gave me a warm can of coke (fill from the back, take from the front people).  C: Ok, but I was having a bad day.

But I quickly realised it was more a diner than anything else, and a jolly good one at that!  Selling slap-up meals of burgers, chips, and beans on toast, it does diner fayre to perfection. The burgers are pretty massive, the chips are nice and soft and it's got a great bunch of greasy spoon options.  It's clean and there's loads of space. It's not the kind of establishment that's open at three in the morning, but although that may come as an inconvenience when you're drunk and in need of food, their opening times are also successful at deterring unsavoury customers at all times of the day. It's great for families and, believe it or not, a wee evening meal for two! For serving up simple but tasty food, it's awesome.",

The food itself is what I'd call good, honest food.  The vast majority of it is very greasy, but it doesn't mind it and nor will you as you eat it and not just because it's cheap and fills you up.  It's certainly no health shop, but so long as you aren't in here every day it makes a great treat.  If you leave here hungry then quite frankly there's got to be something wrong with you.  The whole place has an unpretentious atmosphere and it's quite happy for you to sit in or take the food with you, most commonly to eat on your way home after a night out.  Order chips in such situations and you'll be pleasantly surprised not only by the price, but also by the quality and volume of the food you'll be given.",

Whilst small, seemingly nothing-special joints like this in the States might actually serve fantastic bagels or waffles or whatever, in Britain they tend to serve standard greasy chips. I think there is maybe some problem involving lack of  pride or something.  City Restaurant really isn't that bad a place. It's clean enough, friendly enough, it's not exactly expensive.  But I'm put off by the quality of the food. Maybe it's because I'm too concerned about what goes into my body that I can't appreciate a place like this. I also find it hard to find great options as a vegetarian although their baked potatoes aren't half bad.  There is still some charm to be had here, but some added homely family style cooking, or some quirky speciality wouldn't go amiss.",

We each had a baked potato with tuna mayonnaise which only cost about 3.  The potatoes were enormous and also came with generous side portions of salad  - a good deal for such a low cost.  The service is friendly and efficient and the menu has a pretty good selection.   It also serves traditional chippy food with the usual fish and sausage suppers as well as pizzas which can either be eaten in the restaurant itself or taken away.  It does excellent trade as a result of this and is always quite busy around lunch and dinner time.  Nothing which they serve is overpriced and the standard of the food is generally quite good, definitely worth a visit for a cheap meal when you can't be bothered cooking.",

I also ordered a small glass of Irn Bru. Both pie and cakes came with chips so I did not want to get twice the amount and I just asked for one portion. The mince pie arrived and it was not amazing. It was rather rustic and it lacked flavor. It tasted \"industrial\" and quite plain. The fish cakes were filled with haddock and mozzarella and they were a little weird but good (fish and cheese is not the perfect pairing). The chips were standard and there were plenty of them. The Irn bru glass was good as expected with its distinctive Scottish soft drink flavor that I could describe as a \"chewing gum soda\". This places seems to be overrated with 4 stars. I give 3 stars since it's nothing out of the ordinary.",

I had the steak pie and it was pretty good, but could have used a bit more flaky crust on the top. My friend had the cod fish and the waitress says it's caught daily there so couldn't be much fresher than that! Overall a decent experience but would probably skip for a different place next time.",

    "text": "I'd always avoided the City Restaurant as it always looked like a sit-in chippy but after attending an event at the Surgeon's Hall across the road we decided to head over and get something quick and easy. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised against my expectations but wouldn't put it up as a fine dining experience.  It is really a good quality chip shop food with the Fish & Chips very good (and nice to have some proper mushy peas to go with them). You can also order a variety of pizza and pasta dishes too which looked acceptable.   Price wise it was quite reasonable at just over a tenner for a main meal and a drink so if you need somewhere fairly fast for OK grub then City Restaurant is adequate but if you are looking for a nice meal carefully prepared then go somewhere else.",

The mashed pees were average and I could be without their tartan sauce which was actually bad in taste.  The atmosphere is to sterile for my taste but you sit comfortably.  Strange (interesting?) plates. You could not rest your cutlery on them so you have to put them on the table or hold them if you you want to take a pause.  Average prices.",

    "text": "We were looking for a cheap restaurant that offered American-style food, so City Restaurant seemed like the perfect place to go. I really liked the diner theme, and the restaurant had a very laid-back environment, which was good because we needed to unwind after a long day. A waitress seated my two friends and me upstairs in a large booth. The menu actually has a great range of options. One of my friends got mac & cheese, which I tasted and thought was great, if a little overpriced for what it was. My other friend and I couldn't decide on what entree we wanted, but we knew we were hungry -- so we decided to share a margherita pizza, curry fries, and lentil soup. The pizza wasn't anything particularly special but it satisfied both of us. The \"curry\" on the curry fries was more like gravy that had curry spices in it, but they still tasted pretty good. I was surprisingly impressed with the lentil soup; it was big enough to share and tasted fresh. So it was a large, cheap, decently satisfying meal. The friend and I who shared food paid only 8 each, which was less than we had spent on breakfast earlier in the day. The service was good overall. The only complaint I had was that they seemed to be rushing us out because we were seated in the first floor instead of the ground floor -- even though the restaurant wasn't supposed to close until 1:00am, the first floor seemed to close at 10:00pm. It wasn't too big of a deal since we were finishing up our meal anyway, but we would have asked to be seated on the ground floor if we knew it were open later.",

Super good quality fish and chips and a broad and varied menu. A tiny bit pricy, but worth it for a nice wee treat after a long day.   Sitting in feels a bit strange, and I'm not sure I would recommend it unless its peeing it down with rain. This is mainly because I feel like I'm slightly wedged in, and its a bit too boxy and plastic. It feels like being in a cut price sci-fi, that serves fried goods as its main plot.",

    "text": "The City Restaurant is basically your modern incarnation of the traditional Italian cafes that used to be so popular in our cities. It's clean, diner-style interior is bright and cheery of an evening and it's a great place to get a reasonably priced meal or snack before going to the theatre.  Yes, they do have a chippy bit at the front but the sit-in menu is much more extensive than that. During the day it's perfect for a filled roll right through to a full greasy spoon fry-up breakfast. Their veggie option isn't that great to be honest, but meat-eaters will be in carnivore heaven.  The chippie take-away options are as you would expect, but the portions are good and they'll deep-fry pretty much anything for you. I once saw some schoolgirls ask for a deep-fried curly-wurly (*chocolate bar for those not familiar with local sweets) - I kid you not! They did it too...  Always some cheery banter from the staff, no matter how busy it is, and the upstairs is great if you want a quieter experience.",
