The whole teapot idea (drinks/food/candles all in little individual tea pots and tea cups) is fantastic and very quirky.   I would say that the food was mediocre (had the large fish chowder thing [bit too creamy] and shared a nachos [needed more salsa - a bit tasteless]).   But, the cocktails were EXCELLENT. I started with a Rose Mary (their take on a bloody mary) and it was delectable. Followed by the favourite of the night, Pear Necessities. They were very reasonably priced 4.50 average.   Staff were nice and kindly called us a taxi upon request.   Would recommend as a nice place to catch up with a friend over a drink or a place to start your evening out.",

The menu is great and varies from day to day, with lots of home made fare and interesting quirky taste treats. Waitress service for drinks too, so you don't even have to queue at the bar. Nice relaxed atmosphere which could have you spend your entire evening there even if you'd intended to move on.",

    "text": "Totally agree with the other reviews. We went here for dinner last night - friends had been telling us about it for ages so they arranged to meet us there so we could try it out.   It isn't a big pub at all - I would recommend booking if you want to eat. It's so friendly and cosy and was idea place to spend a freezing Edinburgh evening.   I had small soup (cullen Skink) that came in an old tea cup, tasted perfect and was ideal size. My husband had large soup - his was butternut squash, garlic and tomato - it was huge portion and he ate every bit. Our friends had the pate - chicken and honey with hunks of bread and oat cakes. I tried it and it really was good.   For mains we had: Chicken fajitas - excellent and filling. Burger - home made, very good (my husband would have liked chips with it - his only complaint) Sausage and mash with cider gravy - also very good, idea for winter evening. risotto with beetroot, walnut and feta - I didn't like the look of it but friend said it was really tasty and well cooked.   The service was great - very friendly and chatty.   Drinks menu was also good - we had mulled wine in posh china tea cups - nice touch!   With drinks the bill was just under 50 per couple (including tip).   This is very different to the other pubs on the Shore and a little gem. We will be back.",

Reminding me a lot of one of my favourite eateries, The Butterfly and Pig in Glasgow, The Roseleaf brings together quaint and kitsch with funky and retro in a fantastic union of yummy food and great wine. Could it get any better?  Whether it's a cup of tea from Granny's best china or a swift half, this place caters for all needs. You can even have a Tea Party for 10 per guest including sandwiches and cakes. They even provide hats. We went in the early afternoon, when the Brunch menu was still in full flow. I had a Chargrilled Cajun chicken burger, topped with smokey bacon for just under 9, and it was spectacular.   I love the decor, love the food and just love the awesome atmosphere. Definitely one of Edinburgh's finest hidden gems.",

Eggs Benedict drowned in gloop too - service charmless - and the porridge super salty without warning... (it might have been traditional in my granny\"s day but not that many people would want it that way now I think).   All of which is a huge pity since I was really looking forward to it and had heard good things about the food. The place looks nice in a boho chic kind of way but its not cheap.   I'm guessing the waiting staff know there's a problem - all the loud laughter was coming from the kitchen - but the table staff looked glum, didn't dare ask if we'd enjoyed the food. If you're looking for a good weekend brunch I\"d say urban angel is much much better.",

Firstly, depite a half empty restaurant, the staff insisted that we sat at a tiny table in case it got busy. It didn't and we had to put various items on the window shelf to create enough space for our food and drinks. Secondly, we ordered tea and whilst we got a large pot it was only a third filled with no hot water. They might as well have served us 2 cups and left us space on the minute table!

I've had two brunches here, a late lunch and a dinner and I've always been well impressed by the food. I am however not always impressed with the service which can be rather lacking and stopping me giving this place 5 stars.. Maybe my tastebuds just aren't as discerning as the others before me?? But what I like about the roseleaf is it's just down home cookin'.. they're not trying to do anything revolutionary but what they do, they do well.  The 'full breakfast' or 'big breakfast' or whatever it's called is well worth it if you have the appetite, I love that it gets served on a skillet! If there was only a way I could smuggle the skillet home with me afterwards.. hmmmmm......  And it's been said time and again.. but <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcocktails.in&s=ff99435523d061d6eda2a19ad536b867b3bc75b949f210c0568bb65d452eb677\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">cocktails.in</a>.teapots. You don't really need more reason than that to visit this place! It helps that the cocktails are all scrumptious too tho!! I think I've tried most of them.. -disclaimer- I went to someone's b'day drinks and tried a bit of everyone else's cocktails.. rather than I'm a big enough alkie to have tried them all on my own!! The drink menu is QUITE large and my pockets aren't THAT deep!   I always recommend it to out of town guests and never hesitate to stop in for a meal if I'm in the area.  It does get quite busy with drinkers on the weekend so it's advisable to book a table if you know you want a sit down meal!",

Can get busy at peak times so always advisable to book a table if a few of you are heading down. Their spin on cocktails is pot-tails (cocktails in teapots) but don't be fooled by the chintzy serving vessels these pack a hefty punch, especially if you've had a few thistly cross ciders for starters. Menus are tucked inside national geographic mags so don't think your server has gone bonkers when these are passed around. Eaten here a few times and food always been really good - think locally sourced gastro pub stylee. Split into two sections around a central bar with one side a bit smaller/slightly quieter. Great dry bar snacks and their toasted coconut covered cashews are one of the best nibbles ever.",

Thinking my gangover through I went for the rum cask finish Innes & Gunn to drink - more and more popular these across the city and easy to see why.  Going over the menu I was delighted to see the work crackling and pork. This was a slightly unusual take though..... a pulled pork, crackling, stuffing and apple sauce wrap...! It was all very tasty - chef had made a bit of blunder though - ususing certain lettuce for this doesnt work as they go bitter when cooked - rather basic error so lose a star..!  Served with sauted potatos normally I asked for chips which was no issue and came with some coleslaw and a side salad.

    "text": "Another gem to add to the growing collection of Edinburgh's best kept secrets, however on this occasion you would be forgiven for never having heard of the Roseleaf. Situated less than 5 minutes walk from Ocean Terminal, but located right slap bang in the middle of a mini-industrial site complete with cobble road and newly-constructed flats, this pub somewhat reminded me of the movie, Batteries Not Included (would love to see the amount of confused faces after reading THAT!), and the final image of this classic rundown 80s diner and apartment block dwarfed by neighbouring skyscrapers!  Anyway I digress - not uncommon for me - so back to it. Yes, the Roseleaf establishment looks like the last surviving remnant of a once-bustling Leith neighbourhood, now reduced to rubble in the wake of a modern overhaul. Whether this is a testament to the quality of the venue, I do not know, but quality it is and remain it does.  Initially my reaction was disappointment; don't get me wrong, the venue was clean, the decor interesting, cosy and inviting, the staff friendly and the music suitably ambient. The atmosphere was also.... present (I imagine Roseleaf garners its fair share of locals throughout both week and weekend, so for a Wednesday afternoon/evening it was probably about as busy as can be expected). No, the disappointment came from learning that the seasonal Teatime Menu had changed the day before..... and they had NOT updated the website to reflect this. And yes, the 4 dishes I had seen online only hours before, and was weighing up which one to have, had all vanished from sight!  Gutted.....  Now understand the Spring Menu was absolutely fine. I had Mackerel Pate to start and a cracking Roast Leg of Chicken doused in red wine jus and an assortment of accompaniments including black pudding (Spring food?) and chorizo. My disappointment only stemmed from the expectation of being 2 days late for a date with a Pork Belly, Rabbit Loin, Venison Pie or Haggis, Neeps & Tatties!! All extremely tempting dishes from the Winter Menu.  Word of warning: Do NOT trust the online menu. Not yet anyway. Winter is still on show and you will want to go through it! Yes, even the Mushroom & Ricotta Cheescake.... and I'm the furthest thing from veggie on this planet!  So overall Roseleaf has the potential to be a cracker. Would be interesting to head down on a weekend maybe and see it in busier climes. And its proximity to Ocean T makes it the perfect dinner-and-movie destination on a school night.... only next time I won't be venturing in with expectations in my pocket!  Although they've now given me a reason to look forward to next winter... hurry up Summer! Move along!!",

It seemed as though depending on what you chose to eat there were different reactions to the experience. I decided to go for 2 vegetarian options.. This i dont normally do. All was really tasty but I left a tad bit hungry and didn't walk away thinking \"WOW\"   I really liked the atmosphere of the place, really. The art on the walls, water from teapots, etc was really nice. Also the home made ginger ale was really good for my stomach (had a case of the hangover).   I would come back, Just not sure if I'd want to pay the price I did for what I ate. Roseleaf have the atmosphere down, and the presentation of some food is awesome... theres just a little bit missing.",

    "text": "The Roseleaf is based in the shore are of Leith, but being off the main road it would be easily missed if you werent looking for it.  Its a quirky wee pub, with the walls covered in hats, lots of vintage memoriabilia scattered around and cocktails served in teapots.  Sounds odd, and it is, but thats a good thing.  This place serves many purposes, you could just as easily go here for tea and cakes as you would for a night of drinking.  I have to say though, that for me its the food and in particular the brunch menu that keeps bringing me back.  If you want to go here for breakfast they recommend phoning ahead and booking a table, a few days ahead if possible, as it isn't huge and they are very popular.   With everything from porridge to eggs Benedict and then the full breakfasts.   I have had both the vegetarian and meat-heavy options of the full breakfast and have found them both to be as good as I have found in Edinburgh.",

    "text": "So, the Yelp Xmas dinner last Saturday was at the Roseleaf.  It offered a fixed-price menu of either 2 courses for 20 or 3 courses for 25.   It appeared that us Yelpers had the whole rear dining area to ourselves, which made for a great party atmosphere. The Roseleaf has a great drinks menu, with a wide range of cocktail pitchers, all of which sounded delicious.  I opted for two courses. For main, I had Baked haddock fillet on creamy pinhead oat risotto, topped with a poached egg.  The haddock was nicely cooked, and the egg a nice touch, but the risotto itself was glutinous, consisting mostly of smoked applewood cheddar, and very little oat matter.  That's not to say I didn't think it was ok, but only just OK. It's the kind of dish I would expect as run-of-the-mill pub grub, and the Roseleaf has a reputation for being far better than that. There was just nothing to suggest this was particularly high quality cooking, and I was disappointed.  For dessert, I had the Cranachan cheesecake.  It seemed mine had been a bit mangled in the rush to serve up dessert, as it looked a bit bashed in comparison to some of the other cheesecakes on the table. It was tasty enough, but the biscuit base was too dense and did not have that nice crunchy texture a cheesecake base should. Bones points for the honeycomb scattered around the plate, but it wasn't enough to make it a particularly memorable dessert.  Overall, the food was just below par for the asking price. There was nothing terrible, but it just didn't impress in terms of presentation or flavour. Given this was a Xmas dinner, it's perhaps understandable to expect slightly inflated prices and a drop in quality, so I would say it's possible that this was not representative of the regular standard of food here.  However, this was not the best way to impress or persuade customers to return. Must do better.",

The menu is provided among the pages of a National Geographic, they do a drool worthy homemade ginger beer and the decor of carefully selected antique bits and bobs equates to a unique cafe/pub/eatery.

    "text": "We had a very merry Christmas meal with a large group of Yelpers here. A charming interior, different from other places I am accustomed to visiting, more like your granny's lounge with a hint of expected victoria sponge. It feels like an odd choice, but it does work and down to the butter knives, reminds me a little of home.   Food wise, I wasn't blown away, but it was all rather nice. Again, a bit like your gran. My starter wasn't particularly memorable - mushroom and polenta - to be honest, if I had thought about it, my reaction would be that neither have much flavour - and that was t the result, although it was laced with garlic. I did manage to steal some of the boys salmon... boy that was nice, much better as an option. Roseleaf shone right there and right then. I also enjoyed the mulled wine bread that was a precursor to the starter - and promised good things - nice touch there and pretty tasty at that.   It took a long time to deliver each course - by the looks of it, food was being prepped to deliver simultaneously - which is nice, but in a party of 20, I think perhaps the kitchen was a little challenged? There were definite murmurs of dissent from our end by the time the main finally arrived, which never bodes well and tends to leave a bad taste in the proverbial. The squash and nut Wellington I ordered took much longer than the other plates to arrive - me thinks it was holding things up. It was quite nice, although the large chunks of nut I crunched through was agonizingly painful due to a wisdom tooth coming in (note to self - nuts ain't soft, dude) - could have done with the nuts being a little less chunky, but that's a personal opinion. Brussel sprouts were manfully attempted and pretty tasty (lots of butter flavour), and overall the plate was pleasant, but I wouldn't say now that I would rush back for another slice.   I was gluttinous - I did go for a third course - when you have cranachan and cheesecake in one, how are you going to say no? But ultimately, I was disappointed - the raspberry didn't cut through the richness of the cheesecake, and the lavender honey made it all the sweeter and heavy as did the accompanying jam berry combination. Loved the cinder toffee though.  I did like the cock-pots (as Jenny L called em), the one we had had a fantastic name and went down as frighteningly well as a good cocktail should. But overall, much as Roseleaf is nice, and I had a lovely evening, I don't think it's a place I will rush back to  anytime soon - it's all very nice, but ask me in a month, and I probably won't remember much at all about the place, except the butter knives.",

The bar was utterly PACKED with people, all sort of gaping at me as I tried to talk to the waiter/host about eating. He sort of stared at me like I was speaking German. There seem to only be tables for a max of 16-18 people.  And like many Leith establishments, solo parties don't get tables. One man offered me his seat at the bar as he would be leaving shortly, but I apparently didn't thank him fast enough. Got a bit of the gas face from him and the host. Host insisted no tables, and as I had simply specified I'd've liked to eat anywhere I had to ask about the bar. He said sure, if you want.  I'm not terribly sensitive, but I got a definite fuck-off vibe from the guy and walked. But guess what? I'm still reviewing the place. Based solely on atmosphere and service, this place blows. For what it's worth, I live in Brooklyn and came by on claims this place had buzz. Was unimpressed even before interacting with anyone.",

    "text": "Quite a wonderful little bar/bunch/restaurant. I came here to join my fellow Yelpers for a month brunch outing. I had been looking forward to this outing all week! I found the place easy enough and it looks quite cozy from the outside. A perfect place to get shelter from the rain I feel. I first had gone to the mens room before I got to explore and find my seat. It might be weird but I really liked the old school marvel comic wall paper in the bathroom. It was awesome as it had all my favorite comic super heroes I remember reading as a little boy with the old ads they used to have in comics to order spiderman stuff and things like that. So brownie points for that I thought it was awesome. But back to the normal part of the review not the toilets.   Was greeted kindly by the waitress at the bar and ordered an orange juice. I was then shown to my seat with my fellow Yelp followers. The first thing I noticed in the restaurant beside the awesome toilet wall paper was the menus and the decorations around the space. The menus were national geographic magazines with the menu incorporated into it. So I could order my food while reading about flying monkeys or something! Totally loved that. Also the decorations had hats all over the ceiling and cool little statues and paintings. There was an awesome horse head statue that I wanted to take home with me but couldn't.   So food was ordered, I was feeling a bit under the weather ( shouldn't have drank those strongbows on Arthurs seat yesterday :D ) but not to horribly so obviously the best thing to get for an upset stomach is the richest food possible!! I had the eggs benedict with smoked salmon! It was really really tasty. The hollandaise sauce was very good and the smoked salmon fit with it and the poached eggs quite well. The smokey taste was subtle and not overwhelming. The dish was not that salty as I  thought it might be super salty but it was not to bad. It was very rich of course and I was not able to finish the whole thing , but I was left comfortably full.   As I do not do brunch that much if ever I am a fan of this place and would like to come back here again to try the Big Yin breakfast that is basically a mountain man ( or woman ) breakfast and has the works. So if your in the leith area and your hungover and hungry or smart and not hungover but still hungry this is a good place to go.",

The atmosphere is fantastic with lovely decorations and hats on the wall, which we were invited to wear so that was great fun! The menus are inside old National Geographic magazines, which is a fun touch. The menu is fantastic, too, with many great brunch options. I had the Big Yin fry-up, which was amazing although gigantic and very filling! It was one of the best full breakfasts I've had! My only quibble with this place is that we ordered one Big Yin to share between two people, and we didn't anticipate receiving (or eating!) two huge breakfasts. Considering we were a big group, they must not have heard us right.   Overall the Roseleaf was fantastic and I'd like to go back for brunch and also for experiencing it at night as a pub. I love the atmosphere and the food is great!",

    "text": "Ok..... so maybe I am being a little bit harsh with the three stars, but it leaves me open to bump it up after a second visit. In all honesty, overall I was a little disappointed. May be all my own fault, I could have been too mega excited for our Yelp Christmas Night out and it just didn't live up to what I had expected.   First of all I decided to show some self control and have just two courses, main and pudding. I was insanely jealous when the Gravadlax came out and everyone was saying how tasty it was. Whilst we were having our starters myself and val decided we would share a pot tail. Yes, a cocktail, in a teapot! Genius. We opted for fruit tingle, prosecco, orange, passionfruit yumminess. It also came with two rather dainty cups and saucers. I don't know if I do dainty well, but I liked it!   Then main course arrived, I had ordered the Haddock with risotto and poached egg. Which was fine, I was not enamoured with it, especially seeing the squash wellington sitting opposite me. Wrong choice. Basically, too much risotto, which had a skin on it and was just not the right consistency. My egg was also a little undercooked, but I was hungry!  Pudding, Chocolate tart with Ice cream. It is pudding, it involves chocolate, you can't go massively wrong on that. Ice cream was alright, although it kinda looked cheapy quality, that horrible bright yellow colour. But it tasted fine,   So my main problems - the main was not up to scratch. I also felt like they may have been a little ambitious trying to squeeze twenty of us in that rather small space. I was on the end of table and constantly felt I was in the way/getting knocked by people walking past. I also would have quite liked Coffee/Tea/Mints/Mince Pies included in the meal, I felt my 20 for the two courses was maybe a little much for what I got. I left pretty peckish.",

It's for brunch that I think it comes in to its own - eggs benedict, hearty full scottish, garlic mushrooms and poached eggs on toast.  My only complaint is that the coffee is served in small china cups - I like my cappuccino bigger.  Free wifi and friendly service.  Check it out.",

This time I was here for the mad hatters tea party. The food was sublime, proper sausage rolls made with real beef. The beetroot Bon Bon was amazing and I don't even like beetroot! The scones were warm and delicious. Also had brownies and a delicious cup cake. Was more than enough food for all of us.  They also give you mad hats to wear whilst having your tea party...good fun.   The main reason I go here is for the Pot tails. How can you not love having cocktails in a tea pot and cups and saucers!? Makes it taste better in my opinion.  The decor is quite twee and old fashioned but that makes the place even better. There are blackboards in the toilets where you can leave a wee message.  The only reason it is not 5 stars is due to the price of the mad hatters tea party. It was 11.50 and with that you only get food. Whilst the food was excellent, I think they could have thrown in a cup of tea as well!",

Warm and gooey but not so hot all the ice cream melts straight away. Gorgeous stuff.",

    "text": "So... I have this thing about roses. If there are roses anywhere on it, or mentioned, or otherwise involved, I'm pretty much a dead cert to like it. But I confess I had some vague preconceptions of this place from the reviews I'd read and I expected something a little twee, a bit \"quirky\" in that slightly forced sense. So when I came here for the Yelp brunch I was surprised to find that from the outside it looks pretty much like any other relatively nice pub.  Well, to be fair, quirk it has in abundance inside. The halogen lights are shaded by upturned teacups in translucent bone china. Around the top of the room, hats in all styles and colours hang on rose-shaped hooks. Menus arrive in old copies of National Geographic. The teapot in which our tea arrived was an adorable porcelain cottage. But it's not a try-hard kind of place; despite the kooky notes, it's also a genuine, solid pub. It's cosy, warm, well-stocked with a good range of drinks.  I was transfixed, too, by the juicer, which provided me with apple juice so fresh and pulpy that I could stand my straw upright in it, and served with a merry slice of apple that presented the whole thing, rather charmingly, like a cocktail. That kind of fruity joy explains the hefty 3 price tag, which I would gladly pay again.  There was a good number of us, yet they managed to serve us all pretty quickly. My meal was the last to arrive but I didn't feel I'd been waiting an unfairly long time. The big breakfasts on griddles looked incredible and super-generous, and I heard good reports about the French toast too.  I went for Eggs Florentine. To be honest, I was a little disappointed with the eggs themselves; I like the yolks of my poached eggs to run free like liquid scamps on the playground of my food, but these smiled orangely up at me in regrettable stasis. I suspect that this might simply have been a side-effect of having to poach eggs for about half of our rather large party in quick succession, though; both the wilted spinach and the toast were done to perfection, so it was still a really lovely meal, and a snip at 5.95.  The whole experience was easily worth the long walk to Leith from my house (which also justified the indulgence... yum yum!) and I feel very certain I'll be back before too long to enjoy it all over again. Yup, this place is coming up smelling of roses!",

    "text": "I headed here today to celebrate my friends birthday with a Mad Hatters Tea party.  It's definitely worth a go. For 10 you get two savoury (a chicken and pesto focaccia and a feta, spinach and sundries tomato wrap) along with two sweet (scone with cream and jam and an adorable cupcake with lemon, lavender and a blueberry icing) snacks. As well as a wee flapjack lovingly cut as a heart (aawwww!) Drinks aren't included so a pot of tea will bump it up to 12.50 a head. Alternatively you can give their wide variety of delectable 'pot-tails' a go for about 5/6. So it's a bit steep for what you get.  The best part is definitely the hats. I felt super fancy sipping my Peachy Keen cocktail (yum!) from a delicate tea cup and wearing a hat fit for the races.  I'll be honest that this would have been a 3/5 if not for the lovely staff and the board games we played while quite tipsy. Unfortunately the wrap had both feta and creme fraiche, the combination of which turned my delicate tummy somewhat.However, based on what I saw of the food on the tabe next to us, I imagine that when I return for a run of the mill burger I won't be dissappointed.  Also, a quick note, I have it on good authority (an overly merry friend o mine and a waiter at the Roseleaf) that they have recently upped the standard of their food considerably (apart from those wraps, apparently) Particularly the burgers. Just sayin' since so many Yelpers may have written it off for dinner already.  Overall worth it for the concept of a Mad Hatters Tea party!",

The decor is very twee and the theme carries on through to the cocktails that are served in tea pots. They have a reasonable range of pints on draught and they shorts selection is excellent.   They have a reputation for great food and I have only ever popped in here for a pint on the way to somewhere else, so when this popped up as the option for Sunday brunch recently I jumped at the chance to get down here to try their food. The food  was well worth the trip outside of my usual Marchmont bubble. The missus went for a Roseleafer veggie breakfast and I opted for the Big Yin. Both are served on a griddle and come with copious amounts of great breakfast food, so much so I was moving food out the way only to discover more options underneath. I have paid similar amounts for breakfast and come away disappointed. Value for money, quality and portion size were all excellent. I am well fussy about coffee and the this didn't disappoint either.  All in the Roseleaf is now high on my list of places to eat out at while down this end of town.   Service was good, food was great and the atmosphere/surroundings were spot on.",

I've always liked the Roseleaf, from the outside it looks kind of out of place surrounded by apartment blocks and factory retailers but inside its cosy and quirky. Staff were friendly and attentive but the food was the main event. I had onion and Parmesan soup to start which was very tasty and the sweetness of the onion was balanced well with the salt of the Parmesan. Big hunks of bread = v. Happy!  Moved on to the cajun pulled pork in Scandinavian flat bread. Again, a crowd pleaser, spicy pork, lovely flat bread and a great Nordic influenced salad with quinoa. Oh, yeah and massive chips.  All together a very pleasant experience.",

Cafe by day... pub by night... this cozy wee gastropub in the historic Port 'o Leith serves up wholesome brunchies, lunchies, din-dins & munchies!   Some of locals' favorites include: Chunky Cullen Skink, which is a traditional Scottish creamy fish soup with chunks of naturally smoked haddock, leeks and tatties; breakfast platters such as The Leafer that comes with award winning haggis, sausages, beans, slow roasted tomatoes, mushrooms, wilted spinach, homemade tattie scone, over-easy egg on top, all served in a hot skillet with homemade buttered toast; and The Big Yin which is packed full of pork sausages, black pudding, smoked streaky bacon, and most of what you'll find from The Leafer. Now that's what I call BIG BREAKFAST!   No worries, if haggis is not your thing... there are plenty of other tasty options like ShakShouka, an Algerian dish that can be pimped with half an avocado or halloumi for merely 2 euros; or even more familiar dishes like French Toast and Eggs Benedict. For a cafe-pub, I'd say Roseleaf has outdone the food menu! Bravo!",

    "text": "I came for Christmas lunch with a bunch of guys from work to the Roseleaf.   It's quite a charming little place. Somewhere in between and old man pub and a quaint tea shop. I could imagine coming here for afternoon tea with my Mum, but equally some food and ale with a friend. And of course the sell cocktails in tea-pots. The overall vibe here is a bit less hipster though and a bit more bake-off.   We had a three-course lunch, which priced at 26 a head seemed pretty reasonable. I had a celeraic soup with walnuts, the traditional Christmas turkey as main course and Christmas pudding. The descriptions on the menu made it sound like it might be quite refined cooking, but (thankfully) it was good, hearty, homemade food.   The portions were substantial, something that was welcome amongst our group. It wasn't super refined cooking, but it was good. It was served on retro china plates, and the whole experience felt like you were going to your grans house and she just served you a big satisfying plate of Christmas dinner. It's hard not to smile at that. I'd definitely be up trying brunch here, or a meal when I want a good honest feed.  They also have a selection of retro games at the back. Michael Jackson Top Trumps anyone?",

    "text": "We sought this out based on a local recommendation and loved everything about the Roseleaf. Warm friendly staff, cozy quirky decor and really fresh and hearty home-cooked food. It was a blustery damp day (despite being mid-June), and it was exactly what we needed to refresh us.   I had the Cullen skink - packed with huge chunks of seafood served with brown bread and butter. Others in my party had the sauteed wild mushrooms on toast (earthy buttery goodness) and the French toast (with an extremely generous mound of bacon). Despite the disclaimer on the menu that the food is cooked to order and may take some time, everything was delivered to our table fairly quickly. We were, however, there on a Monday at 11:30am, so it was a quiet time.   They also have a good selection of fresh juices, herbal teas, beers and wine... basically something for everyone! Extremely satisfied with our experience here and wish it was my local!",

This adorably quirky bar/cafe is suitable for afternoon tea with a Scottish flair or to grab a cold one with friends. From the cheery wallpaper in the dining area to the mismatched porcelain cups and dishes, there is always something whimsical to distract you here. Avert your eyes to the shelf above the liquor in the the bar and you will find random and odd treasures that will make you smile or give your something to talk about.  Bottom line: Roseleaf is a lovely stop for food and drink in Leith with the tastiest oatcakes.",

On my last visit I enjoyed a splendid dish of lentil dahl washed down with a glorious glass of Merlot, so no complaints from me.   I like that the menus are in old copies of the national geographic. Kudos also to the beetroot wrap thing which is really tasty. I haven't tried the cocktails in a teapot but hey, it's a good excuse for another visit!",

    "text": "COOL PLACE. WONDERFUL ATMOSPHERE. TASTY FOOD.  On our recent trip to Scotland, we took a Mini Mack Tour - a really fascinating private tour with Rowan Mackie in his Mini Cooper - to show us the sights of Edinburgh. Capping the unforgettable trip was a supper stop at the Mackie brothers' favorite pub: the Roseleaf.   In what used to be the red light district (cleaned up these past dozen years) this is a picture-book version of what you think a Scottish pub should be, with a truly astonishing selection of brews bottled and on tap, not to mention whiskies (of course!), surprising wines from everywhere, and quite probably a couple of hundred spirits. You won't go thirsty.   Or hungry. The Tea Time menu runs from 5 - 10 pm, and as the menu says: \"everything is cooked from scratch in our wee kitchen with fresh ingredients for optimum flavourage ...\"   I ordered the traditional Scots fishy soup/stew thing called Chunky Cullen Skink (don't ask) and it was delicious! I do not remember what my wife ordered, but I had a bite of it and it was equally as tasty.    Is it a bar? a cafe? a restaurant? a gastro-pub? a bistro? ... yes. The Roseleaf Bar Cafe is actually the perfect combination of local and touristy without being overwhelmingly either. It's all good. You should go.",

Since it was Monday, we had no problem getting a table - however if you are planning on dining here in the evening or especially weekends, booking is advised.   Roseleaf has an interesting menu. Brunch is served from 10am to 5pm which is great as you can still have a more 'breakfasty' option if you wish, or just choose something else more substantial.  I had the 'Fancy Fritters' which is courgette fritters sandwiched between flatbread. It came with a salad and chips. The fritters were delicious, there was an appleslaw filling as well which went really well. Salad was nice, but the chips were soggy and I left most of them.   This is a great place for lunch or drinks, a really cosy bar with lots to offer.",
