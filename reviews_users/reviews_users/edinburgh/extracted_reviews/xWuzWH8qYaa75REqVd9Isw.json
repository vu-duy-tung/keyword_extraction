Delicious pub food (more like a glorious Sunday Roast with foodie flare), lovely beers and wine selection, gorgeous tweed seating, and a quiet-hummy atmosphere with just the right amount of liveliness. I highly recommend this place for both intimate family gatherings, a lunch or dinner with a close friend, a relaxing date experience, or as I have done on several occasions, welcoming and bidding farewell to close friends.

    "text": "We had a dinner for 6 at the Scan & Scallie.   The restaurant entrance is through the bar area. The whole set up and ambiance was gastro pub at a lake,  and you could easily imagine being transported to yonder years. Many greens, browns and black. With treated wooden floors and tables, mis matched chairs and leather menus.  The place felt a bit packed, but only just so. I do think that some of the coat hooks are a bit unfortunately placed.   The water was poured and the bread came in little jute grain storage bags. Nice touch. I had the crab & coriander ravioli in a consomme - this had an interesting flavour and I liked it. Other starters chosen by my fellow diners were oysters, ham hock terrine, and a champagne duck's liver pate - which was very smooth.   For main I decided on pheasant roulet accompanied with yet another consomme. (I like my soups). This was a tasty and heavy dish. We had some triple cooked chips and vegetables aside. Other mains were hake and also a bavette steak.   We ordered a couple of bottles of Rioja - which , though tasty, was pretty expensive.   As we had a party to go to we didn't have desserts or coffee.   It was busy, but the service was attentive and prompt. Food was well prepared and full of flavour. I was less impressed with other people's coats hanging over my side plate and also the prices are a little steep.   A nice touch is a small dedicated room for children to play in - away from the busy floor and out of the way of the serving staff.   In all a solid well deserved 4 stars",

    "text": "Scran and Scallie is a joint venture between two of Edinburgh's Michelin-starred chefs, Tom Kitchin and Dominic Jack. It's a 'public house with dining' that has joined the many fancy places in Stockbridge to spend you evenings. The stripped-back, bare-brick, walls with mis-matched tables contrasting checks and Victoriana is very cool and on trend and goes well with the  ethos of down-to-earth food and friendly attitude. Definitely a pub that sells posh food! As you enter you have a few tables and a bar with loads of great Scottish beer on tap and in bottles. The wine selection is also good but has some fantastic house wine options too. There are Scottish gins, whiskies, ciders and drinks from further afield. A short cocktail list is obviously a new addition and has some tempting Scottish themed options.  The menu has starters, mains and desserts (here called Yer Starters, Yer Mains and Yer Desserts) and also small bits (sides), vegetarian dishes and salads. You have all the pub favourites on the menu such as steak and chips, sausage and mash or fish pie, a Wagyu Beef burger is a more exotic take on the usual burger and chips. Others are just plain odd, including Sheeps Heid broth, bone marrow and Pig Ear carpaccio! We tried them all in an adventurous moment of madness! I can say that the bone marrow was lovely but it is really greasy and makes you feel like your arteries are clogging up! Pigs ears are also pretty darn tasty but there was the odd chewy bit that draw your attention to the whole 'I'm eating ears' and was a bit off putting!  We had a fab steak pie with lovely chunks of meat in a rich meaty sauce and proper pastry. What was really lovely was that the meat wasn't the usual cheap stringy pie filling but proper cuts of beef. A little chunk of bone marrow really made the dish. Hake with artichoke barigoule was my partners choice which was a lovely dish but he was clearly suffering from food envy looking at the pie feast! For 3 of us to have starters, mains and drinks was 90 which I think was pretty good value.  We will be going back and top on my list is the huge selection of game that was on the menu from pheasant to grouse and everything else in between. A really great dining pub well worth the visit.",

    "text": "I went a couple days after opening. Wasn't that impressed but after being back a couple times they have fixed the kinks, rejigged the menu and all is well.  Well seasoned buttery cooking like all the Kitchin outposts. Sides are delicious and well priced and you don't feel like you would need to order them as the mains are plenty filling. I've ordered them because they looked so good which is the right way to lay out a menu.  On opening they had a Wagyu burger for 18!! I don't really understand this at all, firstly it is a scottish themed bar so go for Aberdeen Angus or some other Northern cattle. Secondly why mince up Wagyu into a burger when you could just use a different ratio of fattier cuts from a cheaper (and for all intents more flavourful) cow. Thankfully this is banished and the burger now sits at a respectable 12.   Fish and chips were exceptional. The batter which I think was beer based had some funky voodoo magic so that it stayed crazy crispy and the fish steamed inside it's case like it should be done. Chips were good.   PRO TIP  Get the bone marrow at 6.50 it is a steal and super good for you, apart from the fat that is! Book ahead, this place is crazy busy. You could take your mother or a date here, they even have a wee area for kids to play in.",

We only had drinks you see, so there's plenty of room for improvement ready and waiting for my first dining experience. I can attest to a sizeable range of whiskies and a good selection of Scottish beers on tap. Stockbridge has been a choice part of Edinburgh to visit and inhabit for many a year, so somewhere as nice as The S & S fits in a treat - I can well imagine it's becoming a favourite of locals and weekend perambulators. It's tucked in between the Botanic Garden, Inverleith Park, St Stephen Street and the Water of Leith, so don't overlook it if you're in the area.  The decor is lovely, the staff attentive and I'm looking forward to paying another visit before too long.",

    "text": "I couldn't be more impressed by the Scran and Scallie - the food is amazing and the service is top-notch.  My oldest friend recently got engaged (and about time, they've been together for 8 years!) so to celebrate I thought I'd treat her to a slap-up lunch at somewhere really nice. She's vegan, which narrows down the options somewhat and I didn't want to go to the usual veggie Edinburgh places, most of which we've already tried. So I asked Yelp, and the lovely Claire L suggested the Scran and Scallie after having heard that they are very accomodation to vegans. And she was right, they were wonderful!  I emailed them explaining the situation (newly engaged vegan), and perhaps chancingly asked if they had a table available that coming Sunday. I also phoned (I'm impatient) and was told that no, they were fully booked, but that they actually only allow bookings for half the restaurant and the other half is walk-in - great! We had a chance after all. I was told I'd be emailed with vegan options, and sure enough a couple of hours later I had an email. What's more, I had a booking too! Despite being fully booked, they'd managed to squeeze us in, yay! And they couldn't have been more helpful with regards to the dietary request, offering to either adapt their vegetarian dishes or suggesting a few meals the chef could make specially.  When we arrived the place was busy, but not heaving, and did steadily get quieter as the afternoon went on (we were eating lunch slightly later so the lunchtime rush had probably died down). Mr Kitchin himself had a day off, but we did spot him outside with his wife and brood of boys, obviously out to enjoy a day in the sun - well deserved too.  The service was great, not quite as overly attentive as other reviews have suggested, and the waiters were all very friendly and helpful, offering to adapt the sides to suit our needs.  My friend had the green spelt salad for starters, she said this was delicious especially as she's not had spelt in a salad before, and the specially created grilled tofu and pheasant back mushroom for main - which she was really pleased with (she loves tofu and mushrooms). I had the mussells to start (just the right serving size) and the pork belly with braised cabbage and apple sauce for my main (that day's special). The pork belly was so tender, although the crackling was a little difficult to eat (mega crispy), and the braised cabbage was unexpectedly delicious - possibly my favourite part of the dish.  I also had a very tasty pint of Dark Munro - a beer that tastes much lighter than it looks.  Sadly we didn't have time for puddings, but the selection looked great.  And what are you paying to eat in this upmarket gastropub? Well the prices are all actually very reasonable. Strangely the starter specials were more expensive than some of the mains, but on the whole it's really very good with most starters at the 6/7 mark and mains around 15. Yes, it's more expensive than your usual gastropub, but it's been opened by two Michelin starred chefs and the food and service is so good that frankly it's a steal.  Safe to say I will definitely be back, the Scran and Scallie is going on my 'special meal' list.",

    "text": "Great weeknight dinner at Tom Kitchin's latest Edinburgh venture. I should say upfront this review is probably slightly biased because a) the couple I went with are regulars here so the servers were all ridiculously friendly, and b) they also super generously picked up the bill!  It has the charming gastropub feel down - rustic with modern touches. They were pretty busy on a Thursday night but half the restaurant is kept unreserved for walk-ins; we had a 45 minute wait in the bar area which I barely noticed thanks to a very skilled barman and a personalised whisky mule (have a chat to him and go off menu - you won't regret it).   The food menu covers all the classic and some more unusual bases with a great focus on local produce - my mussels starter hit the spot and my colleague opted for the roasted bone marrow without hesitation. His wife appeared to be on first name/air-kissing terms with all the waitresses so they brought us out a freebie round of mackerel ceviche appetisers - not something I would've picked myself but glad I got to try it!   Main course made me regret my afternoon snacking given the generous portions - the fish and chips was big, tasty, and the chunkiness of the tartare sauce made me a very happy bunny, though maybe that had more to do with the lush bottle of red we had (who said red wine can't go with seafood?!). Worth mentioning there's decent veggie choice (they'll adapt stuff) and lots of tasty sides if you can find room.  Given its slightly odd location out of the town centre and away from other foodie hubs, you don't get the tourist stream walking past and you kinda have to know it's there (as now you do!). I can understand why my dining companions are repeat visitors and I think I'll become one too when I'm next up north - making sure I save room for dessert next time!",

I had the fig and gin drink which was amazing and my boyfriend had a beer. We then shared the smoked salmon appetizer, steak pie and the beef sausage and mashed. Everything was awesome and the service was amazing. We went back on our last night in Edinburgh. We got the gin and fig drink again as well as the salmon. We also tried the side salad, hake and the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. The food was just as good if not better as the first night. This was also some of the best service we have had at a restaurant including back in the states. Can't wait to come back to Edinburgh to return to scran and scallie!",

But, the food was out of this world so we'd figure we'd keep it on the list. The second time, however, the service was fantastic with a very friendly hostess to greet us and the waiter in the bar area making a great cocktail recommendation.

It was a last minute decision, so we called in the afternoon for a table early evening. We were informed that all the tables are booked, but at the same time they do allow walk in's. It seems that they offer one part of the restaurant to walk in folk and the other half for people who are organised enough to book in advance.  We arrived and got a nice welcome. The place was already buzzing around 5.30pm with families, couples and groups. They all sat at their tables enjoying themselves. I even saw a children play area towards the way to the washrooms (that's how the call the ....). Toilets are clean and the kitchen I am sure as well. There is a saying that goes to judge a place by its toilets :-)  It took the personell a bit too long to take the order, but as soon as we ordered, it all run very smoothly. I had my eye on the AULD Scotsman, a campari, sherry and whiskey cocktail. Maybe a bit too much ice in it for my taste, but it was delicious (more bitter in taste). As a starter I ordered pumpkin soup (its autumn nevertheless) and for main the sausage and mash. Both meals were delicious. The soup was creamy and full in taste garnished with sage and pumpkin seeds. Normally I am not a big fan of sausages, but these were\" herby\" and \"saucy\".   The interior has a romantic and classy feel.  Best you book a table in advance as it can be really busy. The prices are in line with the food and service you get.  This place is perfect for everybody and ideal for special occasions.  Needless to say, I will be back.",

Drinks: the bar isn't big, but they have a good selection. - Earl's Garden party: they made it extra tart for me. It was light, and I couldn't taste much of the earl grey, but I'm guessing it was in the syrup. It was a good way to start  - Whisky: Fettercairn NAS, reasonably priced - Rioja: very smooth, good with food  Food: I appreciate that the server didn't stop us and tell us we were ordering too much (that's a pet peeve of mine).  - Cauliflower cheese: like a cheese gratin - very rich, served in a cast iron skillet. I guess this was our vegetable for the night!  It needed a bit of salt and pepper.  - Smoked haddock rarebit: the rarebit was very well seasoned. It came with frisee and haricot vert, which helped the dish taste lighter  - Pumpkin soup: I like that it wasn't overly creamy. It just tastes like fresh pumpkin, which is awesome for fall. The toasted pumpkin seeds and crispy ham added texture, and the soft poached egg added richness  - Steak pie: served with a bone marrow in the center. The crust was flaky and had a nice color on it. The pie itself was very rich and hearty in a good way, definitely not low fat ... - Newhaven lobster: locally sourced from about 10 miles away. The flavored butter for this was amazing, and we didn't even need the sauce on the side. I also liked that they grilled the lemon instead of giving just a raw lemon wedge  - Sticky toffee pudding with vanilla ice cream: not overly sweet, served warm with vanilla ice cream  We ordered quite a bit of food. It was a cold and drizzly day, so this food hit the spot. Even though it's a pub, the food is really good. Prices are reasonable for food, whisky, and the wines.   Bonus: - They take reservations  - Free wifi!",

    "text": "Kitchin in Kitchen  This is what all Gastropubs should aspire to be! Anticipation was boiling over in advance of our reservation this Sunday afternoon. Being big fans of both Kitchin and Castle Terrace (And pubs, and eating, and Sundays etc etc) we got our names on the list early. A table for 4 was relatively easy to secure despite them having only been open for a week!  The place is split in two, main entrance is a cosy wee pub, with exposed walls and plenty of sunlight from the large windows, the bar itself is at the back of the room. Two real ale pumps, five kegs all on rotation and fridges loaded with local beers. We were welcomed warmly, almost overwhelmed with the sea of staff, but they were busy and you expect a bit extra in the opening weeks.  We were taken to our table which had the best view of Mr K himself rocking the pass, and you could hear the banter. The team was obviously pumped up for another busy service. Again the presence of pretty much one waiter to one guest was a bit much to start as different people tried to take our order despite having asked for some time, but this wasn't off puting.  Two of us shared a bottle of wine, chosen from an extensive list where the prices weren't too intimidating. I had a pint of one of the cask ales, as did the 4thmember of our group. Unsurprisingly they arived in haste.  We had been sent through the menu in advance, so had a rough idea of what we were ordering, though the presence of langoustines and pork belly dishes did throw a curve ball at some of our party.  The starters came in good time also, and were certainly a compete sensory delight. The bone marrow (not for squeamish) would have cost 20 in London for the portions we got and the Sheeps Heid scotch broth was one of the best soups i have tasted (other than my mum's!)  - not much conversation taking place as we happily munched away.  The mains were just as good, I had the Wagyu burger which was amazing - FYI Wagyu meat has a high concentration of unsaturated fats, which makes up for the fact I pretty much are pure fat for my starter!! Others had the pork belly, fish pie and more langoustines, all were remarkable. Props for presentation also as it was all very Scottish, but not tacky, and certainly no expense spared.  We couldn't handle dessert, but ill go back some time to try the chocolate brownie for sure. So we had some espressos and paid up, not the cheapest Sunday lunch, but we weren't out for something cheap and cheerful...  All in all this was another remarkable Tom Kitchin experience, and I will be interested to see what things are like a few months down the line once all the dust has settled..",

    "text": "Wow! We went out in search of an early dinner Sunday evening and just happened upon this place. The menu looked interesting and the interior inviting, so we decided to put our names in for a table. Good thing we were so early, as they were completely booked from 8pm (and pretty close to full from 6pm, when they start serving).   It's a bit on the expensive end of what we'd spend for a casual night out, but absolutely worth it given the quality of the food, drinks, service, and atmosphere. We didn't even look at the wine list as we were excited to try out some of the ales on tap. For a starter we had the crab claws. I think my main was described as artichoke with coco beans; its unique flavors and (mostly) fresh ingredients distracted me from the fact that the artichoke itself was probably from a jar. Green spelt salad was fresh and tasty.   The portions were just small enough that we were up for splitting a dessert. We chose the syrup sponge, which was kind of like a sweet cornbread with some carmel and vanilla sauce. Very high quality and well done, just like the rest of the meal.   Service was good and friendly - I don't think I've ever seen such a high waitstaff-to-customer ratio before.",

The recipe is a great mixture of modern day classics and traditional pub food, done to an exceptionally high standard. The steak pie with piece of bone sticking through super tasty, golden pastry was so flavoursome, as were the obviously twice-cooked chips.   Vegetable sides were beautiful, perfectly seasoned, which really added to the enjoyment. I usually manage to avoid dessert, but having seen some leaving the kitchen, I couldn't resist the Chocolate and Rasperry pudding. It looked stunning, layered in a glass with custard, raspberries and raspberry couli, pieces of fudge brownie, chocolate sauce and a small, but amazing, quinelle of chocolate ice cream. Extremely decadent!  Great venue for many different occasions, I'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "So I've been here a few times for dinner. I've never managed to get a table in the dining room due to it being booked out, but have never struggled to get a table at the bar area.   Food and drinks are decent. When I first tried this place in March 2015 I found the place to be quite pricey but well worth every pound. The pie with chips on on the side was amongst one of the best meals I have had in a long time.   Fast forward to a few months later, I returned for the same meal. The pie was alright, slightly overcooked and oversalted, but the saving grace of the meal was the vanilla cheesecake for dessert which was absolute heaven.   So ok, I'm thinking I've had one amazing meal and one not so amazing meal, I'm willing to give it another chance.  Went back with my partner and ordered the fish and chips and beef rib, neither of which I was a fan of. The chips have since changed to a smaller cut which I think is certainly better, but the fish was way too greasy. The beef rib was Asian inspired with a sweet glaze that I could not stomach. Really disappointed and left feeling sick from the greasiness of the fish.   It's so hit and miss I'm reluctant to return. The staff are friendly and welcoming, drinks list is decent (not so much the wine list) but the quality of the food has declined recently. Would love to give more stars so we'll see how the next visit goes.",

I did not make any reservation so we got there around noon on a Saturday and were able to get a table.  The place is nicely decorated: you feel like home and I have no doubt that this was meant to. On Saturday lunch it's family time but still, the place is not noisy and the staff is SO nice (sorry, as a Parisian I am definitely not used to that).  What about food? Well most of products are locally sourced, the menu changes depending on arrivals and seasons but you'll surely find some regulars like the \"steak pie\".  I had the \"pork belly boudin, braised cabbage and kale\" which I was quite worried to discover. In french, \"boudin\" means black pudding and well, I really don't like it. But from what I understood this was different. Indeed. It was generous, tasty, vegetables were crunchy and the sauce...yummy!  I was definitely satisfied with that lunch: these people serve food with their heart. They do not intend to seduce critics, hipsters or whatever specified crowd. I really felt like I had lunch at my grandma's while I was so away from home.  My heart still warms up remembering that delicious lunch.  Thank you Edinburgh, thank you the food scene!",

We showed up one night thinking we could just get a seat- LOL- we ended up making reservations for a few days later as they were booked solid.  Of course they were booked days ahead because the food is amazing.  It was a great way to try some authentic Scottish dishes- we had haggis, neeps, and tatties and the goat cheese tart for starters- both delicious.  We had the steak pie and fish pie for our main dishes- also both delicious.  And then, as if we didn't have enough food already we had the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert with some whisky.  The restaurant has a nice comfortable and casual vibe and the service was impeccable.  I wish we would have went back for a second visit while we were in the UK.",

It is a really pretty, upscale gastropub - decorated in what I would call highlands chic (tartan designs on the chairs, mismatched furniture). The menu is also upscale pub food and it was delicious.   They have a great beer list and we started with a flight of beer (\"taste of Scotland\") which was a fun way to start. For dinner I had the risotto and my mom the steak pie -- both were top notch. We shared the brownie dessert. All the desserts are paired with cocktails or beer/wines which was a fun touch.   They offered to call us a cab which made it easy to get back to our hotel in the old city. Overall a fun place to experience a little more of the \"local\" Edinburgh off the royal mile and a delicious  Scottish meal.",

I also tried the sticky toffee pudding which was very sweet and also huge. Definitely for sharing.",

My party & i decided to take our chances & show up close to the time they open their doors for dinner & we were lucky enough to score a table.  We weren't too hungry at 5:30 since we had a late lunch so didn't get to try as much as i would have normally. Tried the Fish & Chips which were probably the best fish & chips i have ever had.  The fish batter was delicate & crispy & the fish inside moist & succulent. The chicken & quinoa was also really good. I rarely order chicken when i go out but the waitress recommended it & it was very fresh tasting and not heavy. I think probably my favorite dish of the night was the Peas & pearl barley risotto. It was so creamy & decadent tasting. I really wish i had room to try more of their food it was so delicious. Hopefully i will make it back to Edinburgh one of these day.  Also, on a side note the restaurant is doggy friendly. The table next to us brought their 2 dogs.  If we had known our friend would have brought her pup. They also have a little playroom in the back for kids to hang out. The staff is really nice & on top of their game too. I wish they would open a Scran & Scallie in Los Angeles!",

I was expecting pate, but this was much lighter with less of a liver flavor. They were kind enough to include gluten free bread with it as well.   For my main course, I had the gluten free fish and chips, which was great because I haven't been able to indulge in that for years. It came with a chunky tarter sauce that was the best I have ever had. The portion was really to big for one person after having an appetizer! My husband had the steak pie, which looked amazing and he said the pastry was the lightest he has ever had. I would highly recommend this spot!",

My significant other had the ham hock, eggs and chips.  That was the most giant board of food I saw for the really affordable price - the ham was also carmelized outside but fall off the bone inside.  He was basically in heaven while eating it.  Ending with dessert of sticky toffee pudding - intense, but also very good. This place knows how to do food!",

    "text": "After reading the great reviews on Yelp and travel blogs, I knew this would be the perfect place to have our first dinner in Scotland. I cannot speak about the parking since we walked to the restaurant from the center of the city--only took about 25 minutes, but I can speak about everything else.  I made a reservation a couple of weeks before our trip, and the lady on the phone was very friendly. We were seated right away at a cozy table. The restaurant has a very relaxed atmosphere. We were in jeans and tennis shoes from sightseeing all day, so don't feel like you need to dress up to dine here. The wait staff was attentive and our meal came fast.  We ordered haggis to start, which was presented in a very nice way. I was nervous to try haggis after hearing what it was, but it was also something I felt I should try, being in Scotland and all! I am glad I did, because it was no big deal. It really just tasted like seasoned ground beef. I have nothing to compare it to, so it is quite possible it is not as traditional as other places, especially because of the fancy way it was presented. But, it was no big deal, and tasted good.  I ordered sausage and mash and the BF ordered fish pie. He loved his fish pie! I was not as crazy about my sausage and mash. The sausage just didn't have a flavor that I was used to and the mashed potatoes were somewhat bland, but I was fine eating it anyway.   For dessert we had some kind of pudding, but I cannot remember what it was called (I added a photo anyway). It was a nice ending to the meal. We also enjoyed wine, which was good as well.   It is not a restaurant I would rave about, but it was a good overall dining experience, and I am glad we went.",

    "text": "When my boyfriend told me that two Michelin star chef's had decided to open a gastropub, in the gorgeous area of Stockbridge, I was immediately hungry for some scran.   We rang to book a few weeks in advance, but unfortunately they were fully booked. Luckily the friendly lady on the phone explained that there was usually a short wait for a table  at the bar that was only available for walk ins.  With this advice we hopped in a taxi, and pootled off to The Scran. Our wait was around 10 seconds, and we were fortunate enough to be sat in the restaurant (not sure how- but we weren't complaining).   We ordered some drinks (cocktails of course), and they were delicious. Not cheap, but worth every penny. I sampled most off the menu, and even though 1 or 2 were not to my taste, you could tell that they had been made well.   So on to the food. For starters I had the shellfish ravioli and blurred bland and my boyfriend had the parfait. I tried both, and the flavours are just \"hit-you-in-the-face-with a-mouth-orgasm\" delicious. Everything cooked to perfection, and my hand made pasta was so tender and cooked in a broth that I could have just drank by itself.  Onto the mains, I went for the steak Provencal deliciousness that was served perfectly pink and juicy, and the fella opted for the braised roe deer and roast haunch which arrived and I was immediately green with food envy.   I can't say anymore than it was perfect. Everything was cooked to Michelin star quality and the service was so attentive whilst making us feel relaxed and at home. I love that they are providing beautifully cooked, hearty food in this cosy, casual setting and I think it suits the cobbled streets of Stockbridge flawlessly!   We were also impressed by the price. Yes it's not the cheapest of restaurants, but for the quality and service that you receive I personally think it's money well spent. If you have an occasion to celebrate, or are after a more casual way to enjoy high quality food, then The Scran and Scallie will welcome you (and your dog) in with open arms.   I can safely say, we will be back.",

The tall fellow behind the bar named Art is on par with any excellent mixologist that I've encountered in NYC or SF...just outstanding. The food was so delicious here that I visited 3 times in my short time in Edinburgh. Every dish we had (from the scrumptious Fish and Chips to the freshest oysters) just screamed simplicity and flavor.

The portion sizes were small (steak pie was tiny and came with no vegetables), quality was nothing extraordinary (my partner had the fish and chips, which was no match to a run-of-the-mill Edinburgh chip shop), and the price was higher than you should have to pay for that level of quantity and quality. I could see where the extra cost went, as there were so many staff hanging around it can't be efficient. I was asked three times how the food was. Nothing exciting to see here ... just an over-hyped, over-priced gastro-pub.",

We popped here for Saturday brunch and arrived early as per their advice on the Friday afternoon - after 10am it can be hard to get a table, apparently. We got there at around 9am on Saturday and so had no issues.   The place is nice and relaxing, the perfect way to start your weekend, really. The staff were friendly and chatty, and we both ordered the full Scottish breakfasts with poached eggs. It was 11.75 which is a little steeper than I usually pay for breakfast but the sausages were home-made and everything was of a really high standard. The breakfast was delicious - really nice bacon and sausages which you could tell were locally made. Even the black pudding was nice and I never like black pudding! I really enjoyed breakfasting here and would definitely come back if I was staying in the area again.",

The burger was sadly way over-cooked, almost charry, but the fish and chips was very fluffy and tasty, though again fairly heavy.",

Both times I talked to him, when taking my order and requesting vinegar, he acted like he was doing me a favor.  The food was equally uneven.  My dish of classic fish and chips was delicious with a good sized portion.  My boyfriend's dish of haggis, neeps and tatties was awful.  He is Scottish and lives abroad and was looking forward to haggis so we called ahead to see if they had it.  It's usually only served as an appetizer but they said they could double it and serve as a main.  When it arrived it was beautifully presented but the dish was a failure. The haggis itself was fine, but the turnips were julienned into ribbons like a garnish and therefore hard to eat.  The potatoes were the real fail though.  They had been overworked and were gluey.",

The only quid pro quo was that we had to finish within 90 minutes, since the table was booked later on. No worries, we could make that work.  The menu looked very enticing, and we had trouble homing in on just what of the many tempting options we wanted to go for. In the end we made our selections, including a mackerel tartare starter, a chicken liver parfait starter, and three mains: roast lemon sole, baked cod and lamb rump. All of the food was beautifully presented and very tasty. The lemon sole in particular had a beautiful sauce and was perfectly seasoned, and in fact so was the cod. The lamb, however, while also well prepared and nicely presented, was far and away the smallest dish we were served, with a very small portion of lamb and a large portion of beans and vegetables. For a dish that cost the most of anything on the menu--26.50-we definitely came away with the impression that the lamb-to-pound ratio was very skewed against us.   Given the time restriction we were facing, we were a bit concerned with the pace of service, which could be a bit slow, though the place was packed and everyone was very busy. And at no time did anyone make us feel like we had to hurry up.   There was a bit of a kerfuffle with the bill when we prepared to go, as we were presented with a bill for a different table entirely (whose bill was 30 less than ours...). We caught the error in time, however, and were soon presented with the right one.   So, while I would come back here, I would lean in favour of the fish dishes and away from the meats, since the pricing on the former seems a lot more favourable.",

We were immediately seated and our service was delightful.   Menu has a variety of gastropub specialties and a nice bar list of wines and beer. I enjoyed a pint of local beer after arriving damped by the rain. I will rave about the Fish N' Chips. You will pay a little extra than the usual spots yet it is worth every lick of the plate once you're done with it.   Overall it was just a wonderful dining experience and I highly recommend it.",

    "text": "One of the most superlative Scottish pub experiences I've had.   To be True and honest, this is an upscale pub, but they do it right.  My group feasted on the game terrine, the steak pie, the smoked haddock, the fish & chips and endive salad.  The smoked haddock was unique and tasty with chunks of smoked haddock atop a beautifully prepared barley with fresh herbs around the rim.   The balance of the dish was great.   The fish and chips were maybe the best I've ever had and maybe the best in all of Scotland.   The batter for the fish was golden and delicate.   The cook on the fries was literal perfection.   Last, but certainly not least, was the steak pie.   The presentation was extraordinary.   The scoring in the pastry crust immaculate.   In the center of the pie was a round of bone marrow.   Before you begin eating, the idea is to lift up the bone and all of that delicious marrow spills into the steak and gravy.   This place also features a wide selection of wines and also locally brewed ales.   I had a few pints of the Edinburgh Gold and it was very good.  Overall: warm environment, great service, and the best pub food one could have.   I have no suggestions for improvement as this place needs no improvement.    5 stars with a bullet.",

I can't remember the gentleman's name that was our primary server, but he was friendly, attentive, and quick. The restaurant was very busy when we were there, so it was impressive he was able to handle everything!  My fish pie (the first I've ever had) was pretty good, though I wasn't sure what to expect and it was more rich than I would have preferred, though still light somehow thanks to all the fish and fresh herbs. I enjoyed my haggis appetizer, but wished there was more haggis!  Overall, a pleasant experience.",

I ordered the Spelt and Lentil Burger (the common misconception here in my area is \"Haggis is served with everything\" and everything is meat. This was simply an amazing \"burger\"! I want to make one!! I have to say, though I ordered the drink special and wow, I want to make that, too! Johnnie Walker Dark, mulled wine, lemon sherbet and egg white.

The fish and chips were so scrumptious and plentiful (only slightly less than the Rocketeer's but the tartar was MUCH better and we couldn't eat it all anyway). The atmosphere is gorgeous-- fancy, but not snooty. Our hats are off to this public house with the fun name, wonderful food, and informed and efficient wait staff.",

The decor reminded me of a rural American style family restaurant and while reservations are tight, the place is chock full of families with children and they have a small playroom. Portions are HUGE and the food is rustic. The pies are awesome, and the ham hock is delicious.  The drinks are slightly pricey, but tasty. I love the neighborhood where the restaurant is located. Quaint with lots of small restaurants and shops.  Recommend",
