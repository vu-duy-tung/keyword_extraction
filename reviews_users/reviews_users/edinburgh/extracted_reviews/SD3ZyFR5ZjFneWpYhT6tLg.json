    "text": "I was starving. Absolutely, ravenously hungry. Sleeping in, I had left the house without breakfast, without even a cup of life giving coffee that I so desperately needed. This is a big no-no for me. If I don't have breakfast, the rest of my day is a shambles, guaranteed. I got off the train, took one look at the size of Costa's queue and walked off. I was on a mission to find somewhere, anywhere, that I wouldn't look daft dining alone in.  I'm never usually down by the Playhouse, but when I saw Taste of Italy I decided that it would do. It's a modern, fast-food style cafe and take-away place, which doesn't look much from the outside if I'm honest, but then I suppose that's what drew me in. Who wants to sit alone in a fancy eaterie? Table for one. Sadtimes.  The waitress greeted me at the door and took me to a table. She was very nice, much more attentive that I would expect from a cafe waitress. I had a look at the menu, and decided on a tomato and meatball panini and a latte. The seating arrangement is comfortable; the lower part of the cafe with the bar is next to very large windows with high seats and smaller tables, with some booths at the side which look really private. I was sitting at the upper part, with a widescreen tv on the wall which was showing Friends. Fantastic. The tables are white and the seats alternate between white, green, red and black, which I thought was a nice touch.   My brunch came, and I was super impressed with it. It wasn't just an average panini, the bread was soft on the inside and crusty on the outside, and stuffed full with tomato sauce and chopped meatballs, with stacks of cheese! It had a small side salad and some pink coloured mayo, but I don't like either (the salad was dressed in balsamic-boak!) The latte was in a huge mug, and was alright, definitely not the best I've had and I kind of expected more because this place is Italian.   The waitress asked me if everything was ok a couple of times, and as I said before, she really was lovely. It is table service, and my bill was brought to me. It was 6.20 for the panini and coffee, which I thought was great, as it really was one of the nicest paninis I have ever had!   I would definitely return, as I noticed a few things I would liked to have tried on the menu! They do pizzas, pastas, burgers and ice-cream among other things, and certainly beats an old greasy spoon!",

I saw dishes coming to th tables around and they looked amazing as well ( full scottish breakfast, pasta , calzone ,burgers and paninis)   we had the angus steak pizza and pollo milanaise , the pizza is excellent! the chicken was ok!   Huge portions btw so , good value for money!   we had two pieces of cake to go , and they were heavenly! we had the caramel profiterole cheesecake (heavy yet scrumptious), and double chocolate cake , not as good as the first but it was yummy too.   Quite busy and that's what i like to see in a place",

    "text": "Compared to some of the other takeaways and restaurants on Leith Walk, Taste of Italy catches your eye with its large, glass front and colourful sign.  Further, it's situated right around the corner from the Playhouse and so does a roaring trade both before and after shows.   I came here about two months ago and was impressed by how clean and fresh it is inside.  It feels like takeaway-come-cafe inside, but there is only table service which is provided by friendly and welcoming waitresses.  As the name suggests, virtually all the food is Italian, with plenty of different pizzas and pasta dishes to choose from, as well as burgers with chips.   I went for the penne al ragu which was pasta in a rich tomato and meat sauce.  It didn't seem to take long all to be prepared, was served in a generous portion.  My mate ordered their margherita pizza which looked like it had a thin, crispy base and a thick, cheesy topping.  Including drinks, we paid about 13 all together which seemed reasonable considering how good the food was.   Taste of Italy is certainly worth a look for a well-priced and tasty meal with good service.",

    "text": "This Italian cafe/restaurant is an absolute gem.   The first thing that I noticed was the open plan kitchen - something that I love - so you know your food's been prepared freshly. It's very much a cafe/diner with the bright colours and music playing on the tv and everything is exceptionally clean. The portions are surprisingly large especially considering the prices are low but of course, the taste is the most important thing. And WOW what a taste!! So far I've had a few pizzas, all of which were fantastic and the great thing is you can build your own with some of the extra toppings coming free. The risotto was also fantastic, but the best (if you have enough space left in your stomach) is the ice cream. I took the ice cream bowl for two with my girlfriend and it was just amazing, well worth the money.   Definitely a five star for Taste of Italy!",

The owner, Tony Crolla, has followed his style from La Favorita and Vittorias. the food is delicious and the free wi-fi is an good extra to an afternoon coffee and cake or a quick snack.

Portion sizes are substantial and you can mix ingredients to make your own pizza/pasta dish, and there's a decent if unimaginative selection. Service is friendly and speedy and most of the staff Italian. The perfect place to grab something to eat before the cinema round the corner. They do all their food to take out too, including a range of paninis and cakes-I've been disappointed with these though would definitely recommend the restaurant if you're looking for a decent meal or snack on a budget. Pizzas especially are excellent value, and there's a good range of coffees and teas, including a gorgeous rooibush chai! Worth a try.",

    "text": "I have always loved Taste of Italy. Cheap and Cheerful...and a litre of Wine for 10. Sounds great!   This is definitely one of my go-to places for a quick filling tasty meal, despite having my phone nicked from there a year ago. That was a bummer.  I've never had a meal i didn't like from here, the pizza has a nice thin Italian type crust, and the toppings are always fresh. The pasta is all very delicious, I've always enjoyed the penne carbonara (I think that's what it's called). Yummy Italian sausage and penne tossed in garlic and olive oil. Nom. I do feel perhaps they've changed the recipe since re-opening...but it's been a fair few months since the last time I had this.   The wait staff are always incredibly friendly and welcoming. I've always had excellent service.   Now for the most important bit...the wines. A litre of house red is both delicious and cheap-ish. It used to be 10 but with the recent refurb it seems to have gone up to 11.95 or some such. Either way between two people a meal is still only 10-12 each. That alone makes this one of my favourite places to eat and chat away to fabulous people.   They also have the most gorgeous looking cakes. So far my favourite is the carrot cakes....delightful. Just mind your level of hunger as the portions are GINORMOUS! You probably will not get through both a main and a cake. So choose wisely my friend.   All in all, if you haven't had a meal here yet I strongly recommend you do. You will not be disappointed. It's perfect for anyone who enjoyed pasta, pizza, wines and cakes!!",

It's set up like a diner and when I was here last week we were on raised chairs at the window which is probably the best spot for people watching. The waitress was absolutely charming and saw to us quickly.  I had the Hawaiin while across from me a burger was ordered. I was nearly fooled by the 'What a cheap burger!..Oh ...wait...'  the burger doesn't come with chips, they're ordered separately which brings the price up. When the food arrived it was delicious. The pizza was definitely up there with La Favorita in my books. The burger was demolished so I think it got the seal of approval!  After I decided I wanted tiramisu (basically I saw the word tiramisu and just had to have it!)  and honestly I was disappointed. Tiramisu, to me, is delicious thick creaminess with an ameretto bite. This was '2 for 1' at Iceland quality dessert.   Overall it was a nice, quick, casual meal and many people were watched! I'll be back as it's on the way home, the pizza is definitely up to scratch and apparently they do breakfast omelettes and The OH has his heart set on one.",

I recently took my Italian friend from Napoli who has lived in Scotland for 7 years and he said it was the best pizza he has ate in Scotland - so that is saying something.

They've got a whooping large variety, and the presentation is so great I considered cleaning the counter out bank robbery style!   Taste of Italy (cringe!) has been open for just a few months, and it does indeed have that smell of fresh enterprise. The menu is extremely varied, and though I only grabbed a dessert to go (how can one resist a profiterole CAKE!) they also serve breakfast, pizzas, salads,pasta, paninis and burgers.   I suspect they're trying to stand out from the numerable Italian restaurants in the area, as there is something a bit younger and livelier about the colours and design of the place. Personally, I'm more of an old soul, but the food here is great. Did I also mention cheap?",

Interestingly, this place is owned by the man who is behind the absolutely delicious Vittoria restaurants. It's proof you shouldn't judge a book by its cover since I find the exterior to look more takeaway than culinery delights. But I appreciate that Crolla is attempting to move in a different direction, and it opens up his highly acclaimed business enterprise to another audience. This platform does the job nicely - all the quality of the Vittoria's cooking but lower prices and a different pace of service.   If I stayed within a mile of this place, I would happily become obese. But considering I don't, I satisfy my cravings when I'm through at the theatre. Bella, bella!",

This little casual dining cafe is a great spot for fast food without having to resort to McDonald's or Burger King.    Great anytime of day whether it be poached eggs and smoken salmon (delish, just what the hangover ordered!!!) for breakfast, panini for lunch, afternoon coffee and cake or even burgers for dinner - this place offers it all!!!    Meet the girls for Saturday brunch before hitting the shops, catch up on the gossip from the previous night's adventures or grab some food here before heading to the cinema.

Despite then proving evidence of my increasingly deluded and hallucinatory behaviour, Taste of Italy still impressed enough on my sole visit to be firmly on my radar next time I'm down this end. Sadly that's all too rare an occasion, as despite it being my favourite part of Edinburgh duty rarely takes me here.  My cappuccino was creamy, frothy to the bottom, and generally just pretty fantastic. The dark chocolate shavings instead of the usual powdered gunk was a further Brucie Bonus. The ciabatta with creamy mozzarella, and bursting with big meaty tomatoes, was also as faultless as you could ask for.  Fingers crossed I'm back down this end of town soon.",

I had the Calzone, which was enormous, and stuffed with pepperoni, ham, mozzarella, and home-made tomato sauce.  It was delicious, especially the tomato sauce, which tasted fresh and flavoursome.  My wife had carbonara, which I though was a little cheesy, considering it is supposed to be only eggs in the sauce, but it was ok though.  My mother-in-law had Salmon pasta, and she thoroughly enjoyed it.  The restaurant is a little loud, due to the low ceiling, but the interior decor is clean and modern.  It is somewhere between a cafe and a restaurant, but for the prices, I think it is very good value.  I will certainly be going again.",

I would definitely recommend the \"ravioli taste\" (ricotta & spinach ravioli in a creamy sauce of porcini mushrooms)!",

The menu has a very long list of pasta dishes as well as plenty choices of pizza and panini. The type of pasta dishes they serve for the most part are simple but flavourful dishes.  You find squid ink pasta here... But you can find a bowl of pasta with bolognese sauce or carbonara.  They also serve breakfast (not sure why they felt inclined to include Scottish breakfast) and cafe... Their latte is similar to what you'd get in Italy... FYI!   I ordered a vegetarian arancino (risotto bowl filled with cheese and spinach) and tagliatelle Delhi chef (tagliatelle noodles with a creamy bolognese sauce with pepperoni and mushrooms) the arancino was golden brown, crunchy and not mushy. You can see every risotto and was perfectly seasoned. It came with marinara sauce so it made it perfect! The only complaint I have with the dish is the cost cause 3.30 for that I think is a lot considering I can get that much cheaper when I'm in Italy... Another discussion!   The pasta dish I got was only 6.50 and came in a very generous portion. The pasta was richly flavoured due to the creamy bolognese sauce and had plenty pieces of pepperoni.   I didn't get any of the dessert because I wasn't in the mood for it, but they have the typical Italian desserts- tiramisu and gelato.   The restaurant has a diner feel to it, so people come and go. It gets pretty busy so expect to wait for a table during rush hour, but worth the wait if you want a big bowl of pasta and not break your piggy bank. The staff are pretty quick and sometimes they are too busy, but just grab one of them and they'll be happy to get whatever you need.",

We choose three sundaes; raspberry & white chocolate, strawberry & meringue and salted butter caramel all 3.95 each. Absolute sweet deliciousness. We noticed that some people sitting outside were eating really scrumptious looking pizzas and drinking glasses of what looked like Italian beer.

    "text": "Taste of Italy yelp review Aug 8th 2014 -7:00 pm  Had another wonderful meal. Great genuine service. A sweet handsome man stood near my table and made me giggle. So I invited him to sit with me. So nice. The waitresses were great and I felt were looking out for me but I was fine.   The chef made me a smashing caesar salad minus the chicken as I requested and gave  me beautiful red peppers instead.   Such a great place. Wonderful atmosphere. Love the waiting staff, they seem to genuinely behaving fun. I think most are Italian. Had a grand sicilian waitress and I learned a little about Sicily!  Very Continent feeling.  Can't wait to go back. Oh. And great prices too.",

    "text": "Excellent for a basic Italian meal and a good choice for families or groups who want to eat for less near the city center. I've eaten there with my husband, with my grandparents, and with coworkers and found the restaurant to be appropriate for all groups. Even my boss, who is full Italian, is a fan of their basic but tasty pasta dishes. Their pasta dishes are generously portioned and they are accommodating to slight changes in your orders. The place can be a bit loud and is unlikely to have anything really unusual to stir up your taste buds, but is a perfect fit for comfort food. While we've usually been too full to order dessert, if you can pace yourself the gelato is well worth it!",

The panini was average, and the original panini that I requested was out of stock. :( There is wonderful outside seating, friendly staff, and a nice selection. I would recommend this place.",
