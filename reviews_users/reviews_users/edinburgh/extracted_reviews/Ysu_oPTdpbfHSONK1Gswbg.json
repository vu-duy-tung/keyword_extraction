    "text": "These guys were already pretty good in the burger field, but they have recently introduced a revised burger menu. And that thing is not to be sniffed at.  Systematically working my way through, I can recommend the following;  WE'LL BE JAMMIN' Chilli jam, cheddar, lime chutney & pickled ginger. Possibly the best of what I've tried. The pickled toppings add a fantastic zing to a very different burger.  TEXMEX Cajun coated chicken breast with sour cream, jalapenos & cheddar. Second best chicken burger I ever had, right behind Burger's chicken katsu.  WILD SIDE Game mince patty with apple crisps, pulled pork, crackling & smoked bacon. One I had was a little dry, but that's game! Would go again... make sure it wasn't a fluke.  Three down, twelve to go!  Oh, another thing, add them to your gluten-free things. If that's your deal.  Good bar to chill out with a burger and a laptop and catch a football game while you bash out a cheeky blog post. Chilled. Out.",

    "text": "Very mixed view of this place. First time I went there, the meal was decent for the price. No real complaints. The service was friendly and I enjoyed my time there.  Today, however, the people behind the bar were ridiculously bad, avoiding eye contact and generally being unpleasant. It seemed almost impossible to get their attention let alone place an order.  I don't think I have experienced such rudeness for a long time and we finally left. I am not sure whether they were just busy or they were just being rude but not really inclined to go back there. One of the people behind the bar almost seemed to grin when we left .   Sincerely hope the owner of this place looks at this review and takes some action. There is no call for that sort of behavior.  Very disappointed.",

    "text": "My fiance and I had planned to grab a bite to eat at Noble's next door to here and found they were way too slammed to get a table so we wandered into here. The atmosphere in the Constitution Bar is very nice. I could have seen it being a place we frequent a lot but, unfortunately, the service we received was abysmal.   My fiance first had to wander around and ask them if they were still serving food (they were when we came in) so we grabbed a seat at the bar. It was a pretty quiet night, honestly and it took the bartender close to 20 minutes to even acknowledge us. When he finally did we ordered a bottle of wine, which he seemed clueless about. I thought maybe he just didn't hear us so I repeated myself a few times and finally had to point it out on the menu before he knew which one we were speaking about (he also mispronounced riesling...which, I realize is a bit nitpicky but if you work in a bar you should be able to accurately identify something as basic as that). We also mentioned that we were wanting to order food as well.   The bartender came back with out bottle, charged us for it, then told us that the kitchen had just closed. If we'd have been served when we came in, we'd have been able to get some dinner. I realize this may be a fault of our own but I find it a bit dubious that it wasn't said before he gave us our drinks. That said, the wine was over chilled and not very good and we ended up leaving most of it behind to go somewhere else. I don't think I'd ever return her just because of the service alone but it gets an extra star for the nice atmosphere.",

    "text": "Looking through other Yelpers ratings, I sadly agree..  NO SURPRISE here!  A few friends and I went there this week to taste some burgers on a voucher deal. At arrival we noticed the bumping music noise from the inside. The place is not hard to miss. There is a massively big screen on the wall and certainly ideal for watching football or tennis, now that Wimbledon is on, The place, of course was packed. People enjoying a Friday night out on their own merit. Drunks inside and out! Celebration parties - now that some students graduated!  We had reserved a table and got one in the restaurant part of the establishment. The room was already full with people eating and drinking and celebrating. Nothing wrong with that, until it got louder and louder. Shrill tones, high pitched laughter's, screaming words of excitement, boisterous personalities kind of prevented us from having normal conversations on our table. We had to scream to hear one another!  The interior is adequate. They appear to combine the modern with the old. Not so bad to look at, but it feels that there is a clear understandable identity missing.  All of us had burgers with a tiny portion of chips, Cooler's Beer or Coke. What I could hear was that my friends were not particularly excited about their Chili Burgers, neither was I with the Original Burger with beef, bacon and cheese. The burger and cheese were burned and the bread was so crumbly that it was very difficult to even pick up without falling apart.  Normally I would have given a 2 star, but because the service was really nice and friendly, I decided on a 3*.  Overall I would not be going back, not unless I decided to get very drunk and linger outside the pub for fresh air :-)",

    "text": "There's nothing particularly wrong with The Constitution - it's just a bit mediocre.  Whoever designed the decor obviously went for \"modern and stylish\", but fell quite short of the mark and ended up firmly in \"hotel bar\" territory.  It's not offensive, just a bit dull and soulless.  The food is adequate but not amazing (they do a decent burger), as is the drink selection (although they do have prosecco on tap which is more odd than bad).  The staff are friendly enough, but try as they might they don't manage to lift the pub out of the doldrums.  Visit on a weekend evening and there's a haircut in a t-shirt at the end of the bar pumping out the same repetitive beat on a loop for hours from his macbook.  Unsurprisingly, this does the precise opposite of livening the place up.  It's not a bad pub - just not a particularly good or interesting pub.  If it were a band it would be Coldplay, and if you asked me to review it with a gesture it would be a shrug.",

    "text": "Giving this a three just now as on consideration I'd not rush back in the near future. The food and drinks brook no complaints as the steaks we had were both of a good size and well cooked as were the roast veg & chips, whilst the wine was well priced and the french martinis tasted as expected. The service though, as noted by other reviewers, is where the place lets itself down. On arriving we didn't even have to give our name as the waitress merely asked if we'd booked via Groupon and then seated us. Both she and the waiter were polite though and the time between ordering and having the food in front of us was by no means excessive but the fact that they have 2 or 3 different deals with discount sites on the go seemed to be causing a bit of confusion (we were offered dessert as inclusive despite it not being part of the deal we'd bought) and by the time it came to get coffee (which was in the deal) we'd seemingly become invisible and so just left cash on the table to cover the wine & side orders. The deals are obviously increasing the custom here but possibly to no great effect if folk are put off from returning.",

    "text": "just came back from dinner. no sirloin steak left so had to choose sth else. Flat Iron was not too bad. Ordered medium got rare. Prosecco was awful.  Steak ordered with roasted veg  got with microwaved carrot and cauliflower. Waiter said that chef has just changed the menu and forgot to tell them peppercorn sauce with no peppercorns but with very strong taste of mushrooms. as desert was supposed to be panacotta with seasonal berries. maybe I missed sth but I haven't found any single berry there. I think it was rather creme caramel. never got a coffee which was included in the deal. all together was worth 10. If I'd have to pay full price I'd be very mad. Overall not very happy bunny.",

    "text": "I've just checked out the pictures of this place which make it look halfway cool.  It's not.    Yesterday, The Man asked me what I wanted to do for the day (because two of the three houses we were supposed to view are now under offer, sadface).  I responded \"get drunk.\"  He laughed and asked me again, and got the same answer.  This house hunting business is stressful, you know.    So, about late afternoon time we took a walk down the canal to Leith.  We wandered around a bit because The Man wanted to go somewhere new, and we ended up on Constitution St which has a few places which looked good.  We started in The Constitution Bar and the minute we walked in we knew it wasn't for us.  The Man described it as \"soulless\" and I thought it looked like an upmarket canteen.  The dining area actually had nice dark wood tables and chairs which, if they were in the main room, would make the place look a bit more interesting than the sterile blonde wood does.    They were playing football through some dodgy (probably illegal) foreign channel which had drawn a few people in, but the minute the football was over, the majority of people left for more interesting pastures.  There is nothing actually wrong with this place, the staff weren't rude and the beer wasn't off, it just wasn't an enjoyable place for a pint and I would definitely not go back.",

It all just lacked a bit of depth, bit like a window display. The place is sectioned into a room through the back with a few tables, a main pub room and a dining room. We chose to eat in the pub area which was showing a footie game on a huge screen. Reasonable bill at the end of it all. I'd probably pop in again if I was in the area and wanted a safe bet. In saying that there were a couple of other places nearby that looked worth a visit.",

I had the Flat Iron and my partner had the Sirloin and I've got to say I've never had a steak like it. The sides of beer battered homemade onion rings and homemade chips (which we split) was awesome. I definite winner in my eyes and well worth a visit if you love steak. Don't try and book on a Friday or Saturday in the near future though as we tried to rebook for my cousins birthday and they where fully booked until March",

It's quite a large spacious bar so is good for groups, and at lunch it may be easier to get a table than at places such as The Kings Wark or The Compass. The back room is worth a look too; very boudoir like, leopard print chairs, and a nice place for a coffee on a Sunday afternoon after completing the Water of Leith walk!",
