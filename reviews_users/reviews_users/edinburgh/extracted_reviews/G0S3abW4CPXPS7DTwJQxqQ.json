    "text": "My husband and I had one mission for our stay in Edinburgh (well, other than enjoy the hell out of our last stop on our two-week vacation, that is...) - we were going to conquer the Disloyal 7 challenge. (Is it a challenge, or did we just make it into a challenge of our own?)  First stop on our first morning in Edinburgh: Baba Budan. My brother and his girlfriend met us at our hotel, and all four of us walked over to Baba Budan, the closest of the 7.   Side note: pay attention the doors you're entering. We accidentally tried to walk into their kitchen. Oopsie!  The cafe itself is super tiny, and they only had two girls working the drinks (the guys in the kitchen walk meals over, if you're interested). My husband, brother and I all ordered hot drinks, and it took every ounce of my willpower to not order a couple of donuts to snack on. The only thing that stopped me was the fact that we were heading over to hike up Arthur's Seat, and I didn't love the idea of making that trek with a dozen donuts in my back pocket. We *did* say that we'd come back for the donuts, but that never happened. I need a do-over!  The drinks were warm and tasty, but it took an awful long time for us to get them. The space is funky and inviting, with an arched ceiling and shared tables. The girls were nice, but a bit distracted.  Nevertheless, we got the Disloyal 7 cards at this stop, collected our first stamp and drinks, and went on our merry way.  1 out of 7 down!",

I got the salted caramel donut...delicious!!! The location is great but my only complaint is that there is very little seating.",

I was very hesitant at their breakfast donut but oh boy it was great! They have several fillings and I had the salted chocolate while my friend got the lemon zest. I loved mine. It was flavorful but not too sweet. I also saw their weekend brunch menu. It was soooooo interesting and smelled sooooo good. Too bad I missed it.  Good cute spot for a quick coffee, donut or brunch. Highly recommend!",

Some friends and I came here on a Tuesday afternoon and the place was packed, inside and out. Thankfully we found a spot to enjoy our puffy pastries. I had a blueberry jam-filled donut and a flat white; a perfect pair. Service was great. Vibes were chill. Donuts were slammin'.",

    "text": "Baba Budan was the legendary coffee smuggler who introduced coffee to India from Yemen, and brought the delight of those little caffeinated beans to the world. The shop, named in his honour, is one of the new additions to East Market Street (which is becoming a really exciting scene).  Having spied their doughnuts on Instagram, I knew I had to pop by at the earliest opportunity. It's just a wee shop situated in one of the recently renovated arches underneath Jeffrey Street, so takeaway is the main order of the day. The staff were lovely, making conversation about how much they liked my specs (cheers guys), and just generally being friendly and helpful. I picked up two doughnuts - one cranachan and one lemon meringue, and a little espresso to go. I'm not particularly snobbish about coffee (I like good coffee but beyond that I don't really mind who the roaster or is or where it originates from), so was happy to take the barista's recommendation of a single origin (from somewhere, I didn't pay enough attention) for my espresso. Strong, but good.  I saved the doughnuts for later, in fact I've just had mine for breakfast. It's filled with delicious cream, and covered in sugar. Naughty, but nice - deep fried dough and interesting flavours. We're increasingly spoiled in Edinburgh for purveyors of artisan doughnuts, it's obviously our newest thing, but I, for one, am not complaining!",

The donuts are nothing short of incredible, I tried both the salted caramel and blackberry filled donuts and my friend had the chocolate filled one... all were equally amazing. The latte and cappuccinos were great as well. Will definitely return here on my next trip to Edinburgh.",

I devoured mine because I was starving and thoroughly enjoyed every bite.  My latte was a bit of a let down - more like a flat white and somewhat bitter.  Despite the coffee, I'd hang here all day scoffing fabulous doughnuts.",

Coffee was really good but the doughnut was awesome. I chose passion fruit cream filling. I thought it might be over kill and waste the flavour of doughnut itself but it was brilliant. Mopped up every last drop of the filling with my finger it was so good. A range of unusual flavours available too. Forget Krispy Kreme nonsense - this is the place to try real tasty doughnuts.",
