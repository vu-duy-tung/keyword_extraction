I cannot enjoy food feeling cold. The table was a massive round one - probably the biggest they had and I guess whilst it was good of them to accommodate a group of 10 of us, the table was so large you could not talk to the person opposite you. Hmmm. This was my second time in Nando's and I remembered why I didnt think it was anything special the last time. We choose what we wanted and headed up to the counter to order, of which only two were serving, sometimes one and their was already a queue. My meal cost 12.  I ordered the chicken wrap, with cheese and medium salsa and Piri Piri Fries. When i got my food i found i had very little chicken barely any salsa or cheese - so no 'kick' at all to my food, and mediocre fries sprinkles in the piri piri.  They were keen to get us in and then back out, and the ladies toilets had no toliet roll...I can think of plenty of places id like to eat alot more for 12, and like alot of chain restaurants, it wasnt anything special.",

    "text": "The food at Nando's is so great and so healthy, I feel like I've visited a spa after I've stuffed my face there. This is the best Nando's in Edinburgh. I have been to all the others but the atmosphere at this Nando's is just so much better, comfy booths, not too noisy; just a really chill lay-out in general!  Here's how to order;  Half a chicken (anything less and you'll just be eyeing other people's food) with Mango and Lime (you can add the spicy sauces yourself if, like me, you like to be in complete control of the spice level). Side of corn on the cob and remember to ASK FOR BUTTER. This is important. Side of Macho Peas; very scrummy, with a great minty flavour.  Sauces; Garlic Peri Peri and Wild Herb Peri Peri. These are the best sauces, remember to stock your table with them before your food arrives. I go for a 60/40 blend of the two.  Bottomless soda.  Remember to pre-stock your table with napkins and salt also as you don't want to be getting up all the time.   It's very important to go to Nando's with some really good pals as you will all see each other eating in a fairly disgusting and visceral manner. I probably wouldn't come here on a  date unless my date sat on a different table.   Hope this is useful advice!",

    "text": "My friends and I decided during the summer to go to the Nandos on Lothian Road for dinner on our way into town. We asked for a table for 7, but we were told we'd have to wait at least half an hour. Then one of our dining companions cancelled, so we went straight back in and asked for a table of 6. We were then immediately taken to a huge booth at the back... with 7 place settings.   We decided to order two jugs of sangria, both at the same price. The first arrived and was considerably bigger than the other. When we complained, the waiter tried to tell us that the volume was the same. So we drank the biggest jug first, then poured the smaller one into it. Lucky if it was 25% of the volume (we did film this).   Then, our food arrived at different times. We could see it sitting on the hot plate, but the waiter decided that instead of serving us all together it would be better to leave some people's dishes to get cold while he visited other tables.   All in all a terrible experience and I haven't been back since.",

    "text": "Wow, I love Nando's. I have to be honest, it's only a recent discovery for me but I'm so glad I've finally experienced the goodness of Nando's. It's yummy, reasonably priced and best of all; messy. There's nothing more satisfying than eating chicken wings with your hands and getting right in there to enjoy it.  On my last visit here I got a chicken wrap with chili jam and mayonnaise, served with a side of corn on the cob and some spiced mushy peas - it was delicious and only came to a reasonable 8.90. Awesome.  The sauces in Nando's are phenomenal and I usually go for the hot peri peri as I love spicy food. I recently bought a bottle from ASDA and have been drowning everything in it ever since. Yum.  Unlike the other reviewers, I like the fact that Nando's has no table service. It's exactly the way it should be as it's such an informal dining experience. It means you don't have to rush your meal or have an annoying waitress ask if you're sure you don't want another side, a dessert or coffee, tea, macaroons. Argghhh, leave me alone to eat! I love the relaxed feel of Nando's.  If you have any left room over after your meal I highly recommend the chocolate cheese cake - it's to die for!",

A friend once described this place as KFC for WAGS and they pretty much hit the nail on the head. Sure, the chicken isn't fried but I have doubts over its original source and wouldn't be entirely surprised to find out it comes from the same supplier. That said, the food doesn't taste bad, in fact some of it is rather good and I quite like the spicy stuff they give you to sprinkle over chips. However, there are far more exciting and better value places to eat in Edinburgh, so I won't be making a habit of coming here.",

    "text": "I'd never been to Nando's before visiting this branch, I've now been twice with colleagues since May.   There's usually always plenty of tables available and the staff have been really friendly and helpful when I've been. One of the things I like about it is going up to order and pay before the food comes to the table as it's easier to keep tabs on how much you're spending and it saves time trying to catch someone's attention to ask for the bill at the end.   On both occasions I've been there I've had the mango and lime chicken breast burger with fries. The first time we went I had garlic bread too but it wasn't that appetising for me, it had too hard a consistency and just wasn't that good. I love the taste of the chicken and it's great being able to choose from all of the different sauces. The only thing that I don't think is worth getting is the side of a 'roasted whole Portobello mushroom' it really is just a single cooked Portobello mushroom in a small dish for 2.70 which seems a bit overpriced in my opinon!   We've tried a couple of the deserts, the mango sorbet's been my favourite so far.   I'd reccommend trying Nando's, the food's nice and it's not too expensive. However, if you're not a fan of spicy food avoid the chilli salt on your fries as it was too hot for me despite my friend saying it wouldn't be!!",

Ok maybe not the best venue for a slap up special dinner but day to day this is great for so many things... the best being a hungover get together after a night out. Nothing cures a hangover like a Nandos! Staff in this one are friendly & look happy. Is in a good location & seems to have shorter waiting times than the one at Fountain park (maybe due to the cinema?).Try the mango & lime sauce mmmm.",

    "text": "It was actually a visit to this Nando's that sort of won me over to the Celebrity loved eaterie, as I have never been entirely convinced before.  For a start, I don't like the fact you have to go up and order your food. This is a restaurant, so in my opinion it should be table service. I also don't actually like any of the pouring sauces but somehow I always convince myself to tip a little next to my chips as if this time I'll have developed a taste for it. I haven't. I sort of agree with Emma C about it being fast food, but I have never once been to Nando's where I haven't been ravenous by the time they mosey out with my meal, plus the chicken isn't fried, and chuck it in a wrap with some salad and you sort of feel like its a healthy alternative.  At this particular Nando's I had a medium hot chicken wrap with cheese, side of chips and spicy rice and some grilled holloumi. It did take ages to come out, and then when it did, it had mayo on it which I explicitly asked to be omitted about 4 times at the till. Funnily enough, my replacement came in double quick time so who knows what took so long to bring it the first time. I dread to think!  It was tasty, again, I tried the garlic sauce, it was rank, the hot sauce almost burnt the nostril hairs off me too. For the wrap meal and a bottomless fizzy drink it was only about 11 which was pretty good value for money because this was a lot of food! The service, apart from being a little tardy, is friendly and they check a few times if you are enjoying your meal, so that'll do me.  Overall, a nice enough restaurant, acceptable service and good food, if not a little slow off the mark.",

Our wait staff was very nice and brought us oour food not long after we ordered. I thought this place was cleaner than the one in Fountain Park. The peri-peri chix is still our favorite.",

I've been to several Nando's across the UK, mainly Edinburgh at Fountain Park, Livingston, and several in London. I enjoy them, but not this one.   We arrived and received no form of polite greeting, the greasy waiter who was on duty grabbed two menus, and walked over to a dirty table expecting us to follow. The table was then cleaned with some dirty rag in front of us, and was left still with rice on it. We picked this off, and sat at a sticky table.   My son found that the coke was flat, and we concluded that unlimited refills of an unenjoyable product is still an unenjoyable product.   When our food arrived the chicken, supposedly their speciality was dry and difficult to separate from the bone. The garlic bread we were served was unfortunately burnt. On top of this the sides we ordered were on the wrong plate. When we pointed this out to the waitress we found that she was extremely rude and uncaring. We were apparently expected to swap the food ourselves. Just like at a fast food restaurant so far then?   Wrong. Fast food restaurants don't claim to be anything special. But Nando's does. I end this review feeling the same way I did when I visited their toilets. Appalled and disgusted.",

    "text": "Nando's gets a solid 4+ Yelps for my first review in Edinburgh. My 20 year old step-son heard about this place prior to our family trip. He had wanted this so much we made it our first stop.  The concept is similar to \"counter service\" that we have in the US: you order and pay at the cash register when you enter. If you know what you want this is perfect. Otherwise you sit at a table and look at the menu and then head to the \"till\" as they call the place you pay.  Tell them what table you're going to sit at and they bring your food when it is ready.  If you're eating food with your fingers - and most of it is finger food - they conveniently have two hand-washing stations in the center of the restaurant.  There is also self-serve waters and unlimited soft-drinks (after you pay for it).  You can order your chicken with a specific sauce - or you can add any of their flavored sauces to your dish from the bottles at the silverware station.   People from the US might be familiar with the Buffalo Wild Wings would be familiar with this concept.  You order wings in any flavor you want. The wings are grilled - not fried - and a bit smaller than what we have in the US. I'd say they are healthier and tastier than what we are used to.  Not a huge beer selection - I think only two. I had one of their two ciders. There are a few wines.  Other positives are kids menu and friendly servers!",

You're taken to a seat where you choose from the menu, then have to leave that seat in order to order, then they ask you questions at the till that you weren't expecting to have to answer, with options that weren't immediately apparent. There are contradictions: you tell them what you would like your chicken to taste of, then are directed to an area where there are yet more flavours, this time out of a variety of bottles. Do you take the bottle with you back to the table while you wait - that seems a long time for a bottle to be sitting on my table when someone else might like to use it, no? Fortunately there seem to be plenty of staff/helpers/carers on hand to help you get through it.  Nevertheless I've always like the 'Man eating chicken!' signs they have outside their various establishments.

    "text": "Om with a little extra nomnomnomnomnomnomnomnomnom.  Nothing makes you feel more manly than eating meat apart from one thing. A WHOLE CHICKEN! There was no messing about here. A whole chicken, large portion of piri piri fries and two bottles of beer. I thought that would be a good enough starter.  Knuckle deep and my face covered from left to right in chickeny beautifulness, I made short work of what I thought would be a mountain of food but it turns out it served to be nothing more than an appetite catalyst.  Yes, it is a chain restaurant which means service and quality is pretty much across the board but when happiness comes with two wings, two breasts and two legs cooked in a beautifully warm spicy marinade, you don't really care about where you are.  Give me all the chicken and keep it coming.",

    "text": "I don't see what the hype is about this place.  My lovely British boyfriend wanted to go to Nando's for a quick lunch before we did some sightseeing and told me I would love it.  I mean, I like chicken and all, but I was extremely underwhelmed by my experience there.  It's just a chicken wrap with a choice of a few sauces.  The hottest hot sauce is WEAAAAAKKKK.  Seriously, I want to cry while I'm eating my spicy chicken wraps.  Also, I got the mashed peas as a side and it was the strangest thing on the planet - I do not recommend trying them.  I mean, I would eat here again, but wouldn't rate it high on my list of places to go to!  As a footnote, I also do not see the hype about Chick-Fil-A and Church's Chicken in America (down in the South) and everyone raves about both spots.",

    "text": "Whilst I do agree that Nando's is little more than glorified fast food, to stick it in the same bracket as KFC is going a bit too far. At The Colonel's place, biting down on a pus-filled tumour is more or less par for the course, as is finding a cockroach or two in your chips, but standards are much higher at Nando's.   Seeing them chuck a whole chicken on the barbeque is a buzz in itself, and when you get it delivered to your table, drenched in the hottest sauce they've got, the messy tables and rough-looking punters all become irrelevant.  The meats of fantastic quality, well cooked, and just a joy to behold really. For about 9 quid you'll get half a chicken plus a couple of sides, preferably garlic bread and peri-peri sprinkled fries, and you'll stroll out that door pretty satisfied.",

I just don't have the time to roast a whole chicken, let alone the appetite to eat it so Nando's always manages to cheer me up! It's healthy(ish) and filling, the fact they provide sauces means I can share chicken with the OH (he likes veeeerrrryy spicy, I am the complete opposite) and it's great for groups. Not only that but wherever you go in the UK you can find a Nando's.  This particular branch is quite nice, it's airy and in a convenient location. The staff are friendly enough, I once had a plate of chips poured on me and half the waiting staff were over in a flash to help.   Also I luuuurve Piri-Piri on hummus. Amazing.",

    "text": "I bope to change my mind about Nando so i am keeping this review open to be updated; went to Nandos for lunch with my friend and he has been selling the place to me big time so i had quite the expectation; we got here around 1245 and the place was packed; we got sitted right away and got to choose what we wanted; we then stood and went to place our orders; that took some times but nothing to be mad about; i got the 1/4 chicken with a slide of mash and one side of corn on the cob.. I believe they were seriously understaffed and our food took over 35 minute to come ; we both picked out some sauces and i got the lemon sauce and it was a good choice; the chicken was tasty and well seasoned and with the sauce, it made it very good; however i pretty much hated the sides.. The mash was dry not creamy and just looked like it was microwavable mash; the corn was dry.. Not even appetising to look at... Our food was probably ready for a while before actually being served because when it came most of it was cold..  I will give nando another shot but i hope it picks up from this disappointing experience",

    "text": "Our first night in Edinburgh and we decide to drop into the closest restaurant, which happens to feature Portuguese food.  Expecting something that would feature a lot of seafood, we were surprised to see that the major feature was chicken.  But we ordered a hummus starter, a bean side dish and a couscous salad with peri peri chicken and a couple of beers.  It was all very very tasty and just what we wanted for a light meal.  Imagine my surprise when I discovered that Nando's was a chain restaurant with 250 outlets in the UK.  This was without doubt the best fast food chain dining experience I have had.    The routine is different.  Someone shows you to a table, presents a menu, but then explains that you have to go to the counter to order and pay and fetch your own cutlery.  So it's not the fine food dining experience, but I have to say that the quality and taste of the food was a big surprise.  For what it Is I give it four stars.",

    "text": "Good food at a very decent price.   The Nando's chain across the Sheraton Grand hotel serves succulent chicken. Few reviewers mention that it's a step up from KFC. I can certainly see the comparison, but the food is actually healthier and the ambiance is more restaurant than fast food. Place is not for romantic dates, but it's clean, friendly and comfy.  I ordered Half a chicken with medium spice level (any spicier and you may need some tissue for your brow's sweat). Chicken came tender, juicy and hot.  My order also came with 2 sides for $8, which is a deal. I had corn on the cob with butter sauce (delicious) and macho peas (spicy but good). You could add additional sauces if you choose but my chicken was tasty the way it was.   Also, be prepare to be messy with your chicken as you sink you teeth and smear your lips with the sauces. It's cheap eats. Definitely not your photo moments.",

Finally went in after walking by it almost everyday for the past year and tried the chicken livers that were recommended to me. If you hate or think livers sound gross well eat these and they will forever open your eyes. I have been to culinary school and worked in kitchens and it takes a lot to really impress me but these little babies are the best I have ever had and theres no way I could or even that idiot Gordon Ramsey could make better ones. The flavor and presentation of them is amazing. I like them with the medium flavor. I also love the chicken dishes they have which are also very good. The place is clean and has a little place to wash your dirty paws before you eat right in the middle of the restaurant. I really like that encourages cleanliness. The kitchen is open and you can see how clean it is. The staff are also friendly which is a plus.  This place will be my haunt when I am waiting for the bus and those livers ( I am starting to sound like Dr. Lecter) will be my little snack of choice when I need something simple and quick. I recommend this place to everyone especially if you like or only eat chicken!",

It delivers tasty chicken, with decent sides and its at a reasonable price!  Nandos is one of those very handy places to meet graba  bite to eat and move on. Thats exactly what we did last night.  The concept is a simple one, chose how spicy you want it, chose what bit of chicken you want, chose you sides..! I think the fact they give you options makes it to be honest. Whether you want a wrap, a burger, a pita or like me you just want chicken...on a plate its there for you.  They also have a surprisingly large ammount of options of veggies to their credit as well as the oblifatory salad options....!  For me it has to be medium spicy half chicken with chips & piripiri salad and colesalw.!  Simple...tasty...nom nom nom!  Happy JD",
