    "text": "We visited Boteco with a group of 7 for a friends birthday. We sat in the bar area upstairs for a couple of hours before the club opened.   The bar was well decorated and Brazilian themed. The bar staff were fast serving and the drinks were reasonably priced too.  The club area opens at 11pm and by this time the bar area was very busy! We weren't as impressed with the basement club area which was mostly concrete walls which were spray painted with pictures. Because of the concrete, the walls and ceiling were \"sweaty\" and literally dripping on you.   The music and atmosphere were great but we just couldn't get comfortable as it was a long walk through the crowd to the bar. Also to get to the smoking area you need to fight through the crowded club, then all the way through the bar upstairs also, despite there being another staircase leading directly outside (this was only used for people entering the club).   Would go here again but we still prefer El Barrio!",

    "text": "Now, we came here after Paradise Palms had closed, to cram in another couple of caipirinhas, so my rating is made up of the sections that I do remember, I very rarely drink so much that I forget things, my friends ruaidhri and clare I was out with that night? Yeah, I'm always in the company of at least one of them when it happens.   Regardless of the fact that my wonderful bad influence friends should have let me go home by now, we had a great time, couple of drinks reasonably priced, I danced in an area that wasn't a dance floor until it closed, late, mostly mixed drinks and bottle beers on offer. Decent enough.",

There's also a 1 cloakroom charge, so that's 6 out of your pocket before any drinks.   The place is fun though. It's a nice crowd creating a good atmosphere, and a lot of excellent latin beats to dance to. Boteco also serves as a restaurant and bar during the day, with good lunch specials, and cheaper drinks during the week. Well worth a visit.",

    "text": "Once you get past the overly wordy menu & it's occasional errors of grammar (& in one case failure to actually say what the main part of a dish is) there is a lot of good stuff to choose from here, be it the tapas options or the main courses.  We opted for half a dozen of the former & one of the latter between three of us and had no complaints about portion size etc. Pints of Brahma at 2.50 (Sun - Thurs) rounded things out nicely & the service was never less than courteous.",

There was an incident with an abusive door person that eventually involved the manager (who tried to make good, but after the abuse occurred). So I am asking this establishment here and now: what is your plan to make your establishment safe for people of color and all people? Is it your practice to encourage white on black violence and harassment? If not- I invite you to explain here and to let the public know where you stand and what actions you have taken to insure that other people are not harassed at the hands of your own employees.",

    "text": "Visited Botego do Brasil as we were feeling peckish and wanted to try something new, so we paid a visit to this Brazilian eatery (ex-Negociants) prior to hit the George Square, Edinburgh Fringe Festival opening. I was welcomed by friendly waitress Ingrida and guided to my table while I waited for my friends to join me. Before my mates arrival I made abundant use of Botego's strong WiFi. Once on site we proceed to order six tapas (starter size), a portion of Arroz (rice) and one main to be delivered at once, which they did.  I got the homemade Feijoada, a Brazilian typical stew with black beans, smoked bacon, pork ribs, salt beef and smoked sausages served with perfectly cooked rice and cassava flour. Taste-wise I shall say that it was almost equal as the one I ate in Rio de Janerio time ago. On the minus side was the small-ish portion's size and the remarkable absence of smoked sausages, bacon & pork ribs (I counted only three small cubes of salt beef only)... may be they were resting at the bottom of the pot...Summarising it was a bowl of healthy but bland black beans stew...  Frango a passarinho: the deep fried chicken thighs with Brazilian spices passed the test OK. Coxinhas de frango: Soft potato dough filled with chicken, delicious!!! Chourico apimentado: Chourico sausages, a bit oily but very tasty indeed.  Carne de sol: Seasoned strips of beef served with cassava, the meat was tough and rather dry, may be yesterday's overcooked left overs? Lula & camarao: calamari rings & fried king prawns, approved as per my mate's MK palate.  Legumes grelhados ao pao de alho: grilled vegetables with garlic bread slices, got the thumbs up too. All washed down with cold draft Brahma beer and sparkling mineral water. Boteco do Brasil is an affordable, trendy and quirky place to meet your friends, with efficient and friendly floor staff, albeit food-wise, there's room for improvement.",

I had the soup of the day and the spaghetti meatballs which definitely exceeded my expectations. Usually for that kind of price, the portions would be small or the restaurant scales back on meat but not here! It was hearty, delicious and superbly filling!",
