    "text": "No idea what some of the reviews were going on about below, this place is great. I am not viewing this as ....if you go to this obscure village in Asia then the sushi is actually better there. Compared to the other offerings in Edinburgh this place is great.  Plus points: - Service was great friendly and knowledgeable - Nice selection of booze, sake was one of my favourite brands - Thai, Chinese and Japanese on the menu, sometimes this makes me run for the hills. - Decor was nice - The food was so good. - Lots of food, the portions are huge for a Japanese place!  Minus points - none",

I'm not sure where the food pictures in these reviews were taken but they sure dont resemble what we got. My Chirashi was a bowl with refrigerator cold rice and some super thin slices of octopus and salmon and tuna. Obviously made up sometime prior and sold that afternoon. It was Very very bad. My wife had some noodles and shrimp. The shrimp had an old, almost rotten flavor and the noodles were completely unsatisfactory. Dont know what to say. I only say all of this to get management attention. This was the absolute worst Japanese restaurant I have been to in Europe, US and Asia. And that includes the local grocery store take out. Guys, something has to change here. It really is bad food.  Now the waiter was a real nice guy, the beer was cold and the seaweed salad not bad. So I say two stars just for the waiter. But man, the rest needs a complete overhaul, including the tables that are unstable and the chairs.",

    "text": "We were too lazy to walk far so we decided to walk to this restaurant. The place looks nice and the staff are friendly. Our wait staff was super nice because I mistakenly ordered the Ma Po Tofu dish, which has pork in it. I didn't pay attention that it didn't have V (vegetarian) on the menu. It was served and when I noticed that it has meat in it, and told our wait staff that I'm vegetarian. She immediately asked the cook to make a vegetarian one. I was very pleased about that. The food was meh - Mapo tofu, egg fried rice, corn and crab soup, veggie soup. Both the soups were so thick that it was past looking. The cook used too much corn starch! The Mapo tofu pictured in their menu was different than what we got. The tofu on the menu looked more the crunchy one rather than soft tofu. We enjoyed the egg fried rice that we ordered extra. And the place was so cold! Brr... They only accept credit/debit card if your bill is 15 and above.",
