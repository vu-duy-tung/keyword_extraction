    "text": "They used to have a sofa at the back of K2. A bit leather one which they invited you to sit on whilst you waited for your food. Then one day, I went in, and the sofa was gone. Now I don't see the point. I think it's because I, and plenty of other people I know, kept going into K2, ordering food then falling asleep on the sofa - this was due exclusively to tiredness you understand, nothing else.  I know, I know, it's a curry house, not a bloody lounge. And, as far as the food goes, it's pretty good. Fairly standard, but tasty nevertheless. They have a quite funny offer on where you get a free can of pop with a meal. But the only cans you're allowed are rolla cola and dandilion and burdock. Maybe cream soda too. It's also cheap - you'll not pay more than a fiver for anything.   So all in all, it's a pretty good take away. But it was so much better when they had the bed. Sorry, sofa.",

    "text": "Situated on Clerc Street, K2 Kebab House is ideal for students from the local halls of residence and I went there myself quite a few times during my first year.  At that time they used to have a deal on called 'chicken, chips and chutney' which cost 3 and was exactly what it claimed to be and tasted great, although horrifically spicy.   I was back in about a week ago and they're no longer doing that deal, but they're still offering delicious curries, kebabs and burgers at reasonable prices.  I went for the lamb korma with rice which cost less than 6 and tasted great. My mate, however, ordered a pizza which came with lashings of grease which he had to mop up.  Other than that their food is generally good and well worth a taste.",

    "text": "K2 is a handy wee kebab house to pop into. Situated in the centre of the Newington area of Edinburgh, K2 is just a short walk from the city and centre and it is very close to the University so it is incredibly convenient for the students.  K2 specialise in Indian and Turkish cuisine, with dishes such as curry's and kebabs. Their menu consists of Tandoori Indian dishes, as well as the more popular curry's such as korma and Rogan Josh. K2 also sells the more traditional dishes too such as fish and chips, burgers, fried chicken and pizzas.   I have been to K2 several times for dinner over the years and I have never been disappointed with my meal. Their burgers are extremely well cooked and haven't got a layer of grease on them which you can sometimes find with takeaways. The chips which came with it were also very tasty, and the whole meal comes to about 3 - what a bargain!   There is also a good selection of vegetarian dishes available on K2's menu and so there is something for everyone. You are able to order online on their website and they have a home delivery service which is incredibly convenient. K2 is open late so it is a great place to stop by for some food on your way home from a night out.",

    "text": "I wanted to like this place but as a delivery option, it fell short of expectations.  First, it took 1.25 hours for delivery (on a non-snowy Edinburgh evening), second, the doner kabab w/ chips that I ordered was missing the chips + the garlic sauce that it was to have come with.  Lettuce was a bit on the dried/old side and only 2 slivers of tomatoes were included in the salad.  Third, there was a curry sauce in there that had more than the usual amount of oil floating to the top.  I think I'd come back to give it another try, since the price is fair -- however, I'd avoid delivery and do take-away instead.",
