Nan bread cooked to perfection though.  Lamb should be tender and succulent not chewy like rawhide. Sorry. Tried for a 2nd time and this time i got lamb palok. Lamb was tender and succuelnt. Well done. Much better",

    "text": "I SEEM TO BE spending a great deal of time in Indian restaurants of late and it's fair to say that I've been on a good run.  Today was date night, which involved a trip to the cinema to see the new Jason Bourne movie, but we needed to satisfy our hunger beforehand. Morningside Spice seemed like the best option given its close proximity to the Dominion Theatre.  My brother and soon-to-be sister-in-law, Jemma, moved to this part of town a few months ago and have dined at Morningside Spice a couple of times. Given we have enjoyed several meals together at their (and our) previous local, Rivage, I trusted their judgement; I just hoped my Indian odyssey would continue positively.  The dining room was compact but spacious, with tables donning white linen table clothes and staff smartly attired. It was hard to interpret the cross-section of diners at first, which can often be the case during the Edinburgh Festival. On closer inspection (I am a nosey little s*it when I'm out eating), there were a few accents, definite students, and some families on this busy Thursday service.  There were plenty of staff on hand to cope, however, and they were very polite and well-trained on first impression.Worth noting that the restaurant is fully licensened and we enjoyed a famliar friend in the form of a bottle of Baron D'Arignac Cabernet Sauvignon at a reasonable 13.95.  I began with the sheek kebab priced at 4.95, which happens to be a favourite of mine at Rivage. Unfortunately, I found this starter a little underwhelming.  While the lamb mince was tender and moist, it lacked the depth of flavour and seasoning that I had expected. It didn't have the crusty exterior or the barbeque flavour that you get from a tandoor, which meant it was slightly odd in texture.  It also needed a sauce to add a bit of zing as it was pretty one-dimensional beside just a standard salad.  Sarah opened with lamb tikka (4.95), which consisted of skewered meat that fared better on the spice side and benefited from a smoky barbeque note to it. I found certain pieces a little chewy for my liking, which is why I often avoid lamb at Indians until my trust has been gained that it will be executed properly. Again, I felt a sauce of some description would have helped lubricate the plate, especially with some of the meat being rather on the dry side.  I was right in the mood for my favoured garlic chilli chicken, but felt it would be considerate of me to give it a miss in case I was reeking of garlic at the cinema, thereby preventing some unbeknown punter inhaling my vampire-repelling breath.  I had the Kathmandu chicken (8.75) instead and it was a real treat.  I found the heat to my liking, and was thankful that I could taste the garlic, ginger and particularly the fine tinge of cinnamon.  The texture and taste of lentils alongside a generous amount of tender chicken went some way to rectifying the initial impression from my previous course.  Over the table Sarah ordered Karahi chicken (8.75) and it certainly looked appealing to the eye. She found the tomatoes and fresh herbs helped created a lightness to the dish, with pleasantly spiced, soft chicken benefiting from being cooked in the tandoor oven.  Like my main it was quickly polished off with a side of standard pilau rice (3.25).  Our usual garlic naan was near enough as good as they come at 3.25.  There were a few wobbles on this occasion but the main courses were very tasty and I certainly wouldn't hesitate to order them again.  They essentially turned around what could have been an otherwise very disappointing evening.  Service standards were set high, too, and the surroundings acceptable. The Indian odyssey continues...",

In general, a great meal, nice atmosphere, good service, and kid friendly place. Highly recommended! We've compared every restaurant we've been to to this place for the past two weeks!",

    "text": "Morningside Spice is a great Indian restaurant and takeaway in the Morningside area of Edinburgh - in an ideal location for students to pop into for their lunch or dinner.   They offer a wide selection of authentic Indian cuisine which is cooked with fresh spices and is always full of flavour. I ordered the Chili Garlic Chicken which was completely delicious but really spicy and it felt like my mouth was on fire by the end of the meal. The rice is excellently cooked and the naan breaks are massive - yum! Morningside Spice also had wide selection of vegetarian meals and I had the vegetable pakoras to start which were amazing. The waiters in the restaurant were warm and welcoming and incredibly efficient in their service.   They also offer a takeaway service which was really popular was I was dining in the restaurant and having tasted their food I can see why. The only downside which I could see was that the people who were ordering takeaways were waiting a long time for their food, but it was a busy Friday night so it is probably to be expected.  I will definitely be back at Morningside Spice for another curry soon, I loved it.",

    "text": "Morningside Spice is a great Indian restaurant with a good, well organised menu, and great food and service.  I went there for the first time about three weeks ago and the decor inside was pretty stunning with a fresh, contemporary feel.  The menu has a whole range of kebabs of varying sorts as well as the usual rogan josh, balti and tikka dishes.  I opted for the beef karahi which I hadn't ever tried before and it tasted great.  I love cardamom seeds and this dish had plenty of them with a good balance of heat and real flavour.  The portions are a perfect size, even for big eaters, and the naans are some of the biggest and best I think I have ever eaten.   The service is quick and friendly and they also do free deliveries on takeaways under 10 which I would certainly recommend.  I can't really fault this place as it's moderately priced with great food and a chilled out atmosphere.",

    "text": "This is the best Indian Restaurant for an evening meal I have been to in Edinburgh. The restaurant is spotless and the waiters are very smart. The general atmosphere is great with traditional Indian music in the background. The value for money is good, it is not particularly cheap but it is a brilliant place to splash out if you like Indian food. The service is excellent with waiting times for food being around 30 minutes when I was there last.   The menu is excellent, there is a extensive range of curries and starters. I would have to say the Chicken Madras is amazing! The mango lassi drinks are also second to none. This restaurant is probably best enjoyed in couples or groups of people rather than families. The only thing lacking is a good range of desserts but there are very few Indian Restaurants that I feel provide a good range of desserts. Many do not even feel able to cope with dessert after their main meals as the portions are very generous.   All in all the experience of dining in Morningside Spoce is excellent and there is nothing to complain about!! . They even provide you with excellent mints with the bill.",

They had a massive selections of mains to choose from (and very kindly recommended a side dish with most of them!) As a vegetarian, I was pleased to see an interesting veggie section on the menu and can wholly recommend the sabzi kofta passanda- veggie balls covered in egg (sounds weird but was goood!) The naan was perfect and the side dish of sag panir was delicious!  The only down side was the time it took to deliver. Granted, we ordered on a Saturday night, but it was way over an hour before the food arrived and we only live 10 mins away! But it was worth the wait, as the food was amazing! Cant wait to try out the restaurant now!",

It has recently undergone a refurbishment and now the interior looks classy and modern; I went for a meal there this evening and there were fresh tulips on the tables, it was a nice touch. The staff are wonderful; whenever I visit I am greeted like an old friend, it's one of the reasons I keep going back. Tonight I ordered the lamb tikka, it is a relatively simple dish but a lot depends on the quality of the lamb; needless to say, the quality of the meat was excellent and I enjoyed my dinner immensely. I finished off with the pistachio kulfi which the waiter informed me was homemade, it was delicious and my mum declared it 'magnificent'. I can't wait for my next visit.",
