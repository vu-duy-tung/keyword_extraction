    "text": "We were lured in by the name, plain and simple. When inside, we were a little taken aback. It kind of looks like a REALLY clean dive bar that I used to go to in New York. Unfortunately Boozy Cow did not have any of the charm or atmosphere of said dive bar.   We had food, which we were told would arrive in a tray. I got way excited, I love sharing food and getting really messy when eating. When the food arrived it came on a plate in a tray, making the tray feel kind of redundant.   Food itself was ok, but did not feel like the best value.  The main bug bare was the really uncomfortable seats, my poor bum couldn't take that much punishment.",

Later in the evening after having something to eat we decided to go have a drink, as we walked in it was really busy and modern.I didn't realise they did food but it looked great. We decided to have a cocktail they were so reasonably priced and really tasty I had a few cocktails but the boozy bru was my fave it had gin citrus and irn bru which I though was fab. They used irn bru in s few of there cocktails and I though that was a really good idea. Before we went home we went back to have a burger and a few more cocktails, the burgers were really tasty I had a cheese burger and me and my partner shared some chips. It's a really great place and I loved everything shout it. The staff were really friendly and helpfull if I'm in edinburgh again I'm defiantly going back.",

Not really that different tbh.  The food was plentiful and sloppy, layered with cheese, sauces etc.  I ordered the wings and fries, I'm a creature of habit, especially in diners like this.  My other half had a phili cheese steak sub with chilli fries and my brother had a hot dog. No real complains, but no one was raving about it either. It was fine.  Probably wouldn't go back as there are plenty of other places that do this type of food better.",

    "text": "I used to like Amicus Apple, which was before Boozy Cow came to town. I didn't have a problem with that. And even though there often used to be a 'makeover' for a fresher look, Amicus Apple was alright. I enjoyed sitting on the outside terrace on hot summer days, and inside during colder times.   I didn't know much about Boozy Cow, so Rayan D. and I decided to meet up for a drink there just to see what it was all about. The layout has changed slightly, making it perhaps a more roomier space and the walls are all 'hip' (?) - graffiti style so maybe it tries to look cool, I don't know. Maybe I'm just too old for such places.  The impressive drinks offering of Amicus Apple was gone. I mean it's still a bar, of course, but.. I don't think I could have had a raspberry vodka and coke with fresh raspberries here. So, I ordered a Hendricks gin & tonic. The bartender wasn't unfriendly or friendly, he just seemed to be doing his job. So he got my drink, I think it was 4.50 or in that region. I'm sorry to say but the excellent Hendricks and gin got lost somewhere - the draft tonic perhaps did it. I was disappointed.  We had one drink each and left. Not really my kind of place, sorry.",

It is typical of most of the burger places opening up everywhere - graffiti on the walls, a mismatch of furniture and of course booze and burgers! The cocktails here are pretty decent - especially the boozy bru (gin, citrus and irn bru). In fact they were that good I returned for another the day after! On the second visit we had the burgers - a cheese burger and a 'holy cow' burger. They were very nice but not the best I've ever had. The bun became a bit of a sloppy mess very quickly so I had to resort to eating it in pieces. At least it tasted good. Service is good and the bar tenders are very friendly.

It really was too bad. We had already waited for quite a while in the bar downstairs and we were looking forward to trying this place out.  Unfortunately, they don't have a take away license... This was really a bummer because their meals are way too much to eat in one sitting (figure in drink prices, etc. and this makes it even worse). It's quite a waste to eat here when you're on a budget!",

I like how they served my drink in a quirky metal tin but nothing on the drink menu made me go wow I totally want to try that. I probably would give this place another go to try their food menu as a lot of folks were eating there that night. So maybe food is more exciting there than their drinks... TO BE continued",

They'd be better off ditching the idea of table service and getting folks to order at the bar.  Lacklustre interior - exposed chipboard and wiring, really? And the \"spray paint\" decor is bloody awful. It probably ticked the boxes on paper, but I'd be asking for my money back.  The cocktails were a joke. I ordered a \"PBJ\" cocktail, listed on the menu as: \"Bourbon, peanut butter & jelly\". What I received in actuality was a small bucket of nuts and a bourbon. I was charged 7.50 for the \"experience\".  Why 2 stars instead of 1? The food was adequate and hot, if not late and uninspiring.  I could understand somewhere like this getting rave reviews where there's NOT a lot of competition, but in Edinburgh, there's: BURGER, The Cambridge Bar, Handmade Burger Co, The Black Fox, Shebeen, 56 North... If they want to actually stand out, they're going to offer much better than this - seems to be they're trying to jump on the bandwagon and failing.  My advice: don't waste your time and money here - go to many of the other alternatives available in Edinburgh.",

I'd rate this in the theme bar bracket so not really my thing. With a high turnover of up the toon Saturday shoppers/randoms along with a core of regulars it's a loud place. Food served on trays like a 50s drive in diner, pretty much everything deep fried or with a coronary on the side, cocktails annoyingly quirky and overly sweet. 3 stars for the macaroni cheese waffle - I know, it's a thing! Could feel myself losing the feeling in my arm as I ate it but, as I was nursing a hangover at the time, it totally hit the spot. Not for the health conscious.",

You feel as if you've been transported back to the mid 70's with the graffiti on the walls and it's dimly lit with candles on the table. We sat at the back and they have high tables and chairs. We ordered the cheese burger, dirty dog and fries. They served it on a metal pan and the food looked delish. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium and both meals were delectable. Our server checked in with us periodically to make sure everything was good. We splurged and ordered a chocolate brownie a la mode... The brownie was freshly baked right out of the oven and it was a good size square and the added vanilla scoop balanced the flavor as it was drizzled with chocolate syrup. They serve you water in glass skulls which adds to the ambiance. Give it a try, this is a fun Place with good food.",

The boozy cow is your one stop burger shop ! I really can't say fairer than that, they will provide you with ; Food  Drink Warmth Music  And a bloody good time !   The food here is spectacular I have been a few times previously and I have never I repeat never been disappointed with the food ! This time Amanda H and I opted for the Dirty chicken and the special burger of the day which funnily enough as it was festival - was haggis ! Both excellently cooked and the picture of a good burger to eat !   The drinks , now here what I really like!  They have a good extensive list of cocktails and also beers including vedett so all a good there but equally if not more importantly they have a really extensive range of non alcoholic drinks which is really really impressive   The warmth speaks for itself from the service provided to the actual temperature ( the gents WC ) it certainly wakes you up!   Live music from the bar played at a nice level not too quiet but loud enough for you to either loose at karaoke or chat to the rest of your table   With all of the above facts considered now you can see what you WILL have a bloody good time",

    "text": "Came here with some friends totally unplanned on a Sunday night. Pretty sure we waited for a spot for at least 45 minutes, if not more. We just mostly wanted to eat so we didn't really try any of the drinks, but it seemed like they had a lot of interesting cocktails and a good range of beers.   It was SUPER loud, which I wasn't so keen on. But it makes sense I guess cause it's kinda more of a bar atmosphere than a restaurant. It actually reminded me a LOT of Meat Liquor from England. They even serve their food on sharing trays in lieu of actual plates...  Food wise, was pretty good! Not sure I'd say it was amazing and totally different from anything I've ever had, but it was tasty. I really wanted to try this macaroni cheese waffle but they ran out so I had to contend myself with a chicken burger and onion rings. The rings were MASSIVE!!! And super tasty. I also tried these peanut butter popcorn chicken things that were... weird... Didn't really like them much. They also came in a little baggie with popcorn underneath?!? A bit weird but ok whatever, it's different.   I'm not a huge burger person so I can't imagine wanting to come back many times over, I also don't live in Scotland so there's that too. That being said, I wouldn't mind returning JUST to try that waffle dish!!! And the cocktails. That too.",

There was only one bartender behind the bar while we were there so it took about 10 minutes to get our drinks, but whatever. The beer tasted great. They had outdoor seating which was nice. We didn't order food. Overall, I had a decent experience here & if I was in the area, I'd go back.",

    "text": "Such an awesome experience! My husband and I were craving a burger on our visit to Edinburgh before visiting Edinburgh Castle. This place did not disappoint. Yes you eat off a tray, yes it'll get messy with your burger, yes you might be sharing a tray with the person across from you, but big deal! At the end of the day, a burger is not a fancy meal.  Our waitress was helpful and kind. Had great recommendations on food and drinks. We got the Maple Bacon Cheese Burger, Holy Cow Burger, and the Skinnies Fries. Scotland law cannot make a burger under medium well but for what it was.. It was SO good! The atmosphere is different in a good way! Very grungy, graffiti, and all of the fun stuff for a unique experience. Definitely enjoyed it and we'll be coming back if we come through Scotland again!",

Got that typical dark, grungy vibe that is ever so popular at the moment with a sprawling lower level space.   Lots of variety from the drink menu - good cocktail selection - but the ciders are leaning towards pricey at 4 for a can. Cocktails start from 5.50 and the milkshakes are really brilliant - thoroughly recommend their Oreo concoction.   Basic selection as far as the menu goes; beef burgers, chicken burgers, hot dogs and a couple of veggie options. Chips are extra as is the norm in many burger places but not too pricey. Quality of food was pretty decent but nothing outstanding.   Service was a bit of a let down, staff were pleasant enough but quite slow and difficult to flag down.  Had to ask for parts of our order that were forgotten three times before they arrived which was frustrating however they did take it off our bill, nice gesture!   Could be a nice place for an evening drink but not overwhelmed by food.",

The place itself, hmm, not a big fan of the chipboard walls and graffiti, and less of a fan of the metal floor, as everytime you moved your chair it made a racket!  When we sat down we were told we were in for a \"unique dining experience\", we'd be eating of trays, no cutlery would be provided (unless we specifically asked) and napkins were in the form of an entire roll of kitchen roll. This is where I was less keen, I like cutlery, I was always going to ask for some. The metal trays, well, that was just a bit weird, sharing a tray of food with the person sitting opposite you. Not entirely sold on the idea, again, whats wrong with a plate?! Not sure what would have happened if one of us was veggie and didn't want our food on the same tray, wasn't an issue for us, but still.  Overall, no, I don't think I'd go back, the burgers were nice, but it's not like Edinburgh has a shortage of burger places!",

    "text": "Once I stepped through the door of what used to be the Amicus Apple; the Boozy Cow reminded me of a place I used to work in. Back in the late 80's I worked in a Student/Live music venue which had Spartan furniture, easy to clean floor, alternative grunge music and wall decorations and huge amount of our own handy work graffiti adorning the walls, doors and ceiling. THIS.   What they are trying to achieve, I do not exactly know. They are missing some major attractions like .. uhuh.. draft beer? Bottled tonic water with a Hendriks Gin instead of from a spout - they ruined a perfectly nice gin.   I got a 330ml can of Cornish Pilsner for 4.50 - Really? REALLY?! - Oh yes.. it came in a frozen glass. Whoop-Ti-Doo.  No. Wrong. They may want to attempt to channel a bit of the Hard Rock Cafe culture, (they have the WiFi \"table is ready\" buzzers, but somehow they missed the point completely.   Certainly the newly appointed staff is dressed fittingly sporting the Grunge / SKA dress code to a T. The bartender was suitably aloof and uninterested.  I'd say if this was in Leith or Cowgate it would have made an okay, even a nice addition, but just around the corner of Princes Street it does not.   I am sorry to see a place like this has opened in its current form and format. Luckily I have more to choose from in town and this will be avoided.",

However, after that point the experience started to change. After being seated, we looked at the selection of new beers and quirky food on offer. After 20 minutes waiting to order we should have left. Slow service and it felt more like a club than a bar with food section being left to the side.  We ordered the burger and chilli cheese dog with sweet potato fries as sides. The food took over thirty minutes to be delivered. While the chilli cheese dog was pretty good, the burger was small and disappointing and more expensive. The beers while nice, were in cans and cost the same as a pint at other similar establishments.   Overall, the place is not good value for your money and the service is bellow acceptable standard. I will not be returning.",

The burger was ok - nothing amazing but not awful either. The meat patty was quite small so there was a bit of nomming before I got to it. The sides fared better, with crispy fried pickles and dipping sauce, yummy sweet potato fries and huge onion rings that hit the spot. I ordered a can of Red Stripe to wash it all down and the can arrived freezing cold with a chilled glass, which was a good touch.   Word of warning - there are no plates or cutlery, so I was pleased that the waiter gave us some wee side plates to eat our food off. I hate paying through the nose for food that doesn't even arrive on a plate. Your fingers get gross and sticky so it was a good move that the staff offered towelettes for your hands after eating. Otherwise, eww.  Ambience wise, it felt more like a loud pub than an eating establishment. The decor was dark and grimy, with paint splattered all over the walls. The seats were high, wobbly stools with narrow tables made from chipboard. I felt like I was sitting in an industrial abattoir, so I wasn't a fan of the decor much at all. The music was seriously loud so the patrons were shouting in order to hear each other. It all felt a bit like The Boozy Cow is trying too hard.   So all in all, fair grub but nothing astonishing, delivered in an establishment that feels like the insides of an internal organ.",
