I try to follow a vegan diet and really appreciate the variety of the menu.  The food is delicious!  The desserts are amazing.  Low-key vibe, with absolutely delicious food and the friendliest staff.  I am a big fan.",

We had tomato soup the first time we came and last night I had the smashed avocado sandwich and hubby had BLT with chips. Perfection.",

    "text": "Great little full vegan restaurant. Simple menu with really great dishes and desserts that are sure to please.  I had the quarter pounder - the hummus and sauce made it taste very similar to a cheeseburger. The homemade bun was also a key to its success. Could have used a pickle and mustard on the side, but I loved it anyway. The fries were hardy and delicious. I also had a cherry bake-well for dessert that was delightful.  I went at 2:30pm and they were slammed but I was still served very quickly.  Suggestion: Needs updated signage, I almost walked past it. It is downstairs in what was once a cafe.",

    "text": "Wonderful cafe, with a focus on organic, healthy, yet still delicious and fun food.  I've had a couple of the burgers, and they were both mighty tasty. The Mexican burger that I had this week probably rates as the best vegan burger of all time that I've ever eaten. Yes, it was that good! And proper chips made from potatoes :-)  The cakes are also pretty mighty - I've had a peanut butter and chocolate cake, and the coconut banoffee pie, which was just an utter delight.  The juices are good too, and my colleague really enjoyed his protein shake. And some of my chips...  A winner for everyone, and a vegan haven.",

Their buns are homemade which makes them especially delightful. We shared a slice of chocolate salted caramel cake which was sooo good, I wish we could've tried all of their cakes (they had six!!). Everything's vegan and everything's delicious!!",

    "text": "Best bean burger I've ever had! The place is really cute & small with a lovely garden area at the back. The burgers were all the same price (12, I think) and all looked incredible. The flavour of both of ours was delicious, the portions were pretty huge (you get your money's worth), and it was served pretty quickly. The menu was adventurous and definitely had a wide range of options. My one problem was that there wasn't a waiter & there only seemed to be 1 barista who was serving all the customers food & making hot drinks. It just meant that we had to prompt her to give us cutlery / a menu / take our order. Other than that (which wasn't a real issue in the grand scheme of things!), we had a delicious and filling lunch that was completely vegan! I will be back...",
