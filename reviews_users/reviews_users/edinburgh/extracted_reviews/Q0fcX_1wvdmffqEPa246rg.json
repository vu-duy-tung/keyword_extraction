    "text": "I found the Witchery distinctly over rated and over priced.   The interior of the witchery is great, really cosy restaurant and on first impressions, it looks like its going to be spectacular. I had heard many good things about it.   The staff were snobby. They gave me the impression that they didn't think I was good enough to be there. I found it really hard to relax as they made you feel very conscious of how you were acting.   The food was good. But the portions were tiny and hugely expensive. I know that is what you get with a la carte, but I expect mind blowing food when the prices reach that extent.   Oysters were great. Very fresh, but short of making sure they're fresh, it's hard to get oysters wrong.   My duck was tasty, but i got four tiny pieces of it - not worth the price tag.   If you can afford to go there and not worry about whether you're going to get value for money. Go. I felt I didn't get value for money at all.",

    "text": "I have eaten here about half a dozen times. It has always been good. I prefer the Witchery rather than the secret garden. The menu does not change very often - but this is not the sort of place you would eat all the time anyway.   The highlight here is the meat - amazing lamb and steaks. I took my 90 year old Gran here and she said it was the best steak she had ever tried in her whole life! The seafood is also wonderful - I shared a seafood platter with my sister on one visit and was brilliant.   The puddings are also lush - my favorite if the pudding platter they do - you get a little taster portion of about 5 different desserts - perfect to share to finish off a meal .   The wine list is impressive - a huge book - probably too large actually as you don't have time to review it all.   The only reason I have not given it 5 stars is that last time we were there they seemed to have lost their attention to detail. The service wasn't quite spot on and my soup was luke warm when it arrived.   Will defo go again for a special occasion but service needs to improve.",

You must book at the very least one week in advance.   We first visited when we had friends to stay and were looking for somewhere to impress them but scottish at the same time. We were not disappointed.   On arrival our coats were taken and we were shown down candel lit stair to the lower restaurant where everything is lit by candle. The staff were all so attentive and just knew the right times to approach us.   The menu was absolutely perfect, you could spend a lot of money or not the pricing varied from 14 - 50 for main cousres. Then there was the wine list. Over 1000 wines to choose from and needless to say we didn't go for the most expensive we saw which was 3000 but we did get a very pleasing bottle of red for around 35.   If you wish you can stay in one of the seven suites at the witchery with prices starting at around 300 per night.",

The decor in the Secret Garden is beautiful (would recommend requesting this part of the restaurant over the main house). The service was friendly but swung strangely between being a little overwhelming (4 or 5 staff serving us) to no staff in sight. Some of the younger staff didn't seem like the kind of standard you'd expect from a pricier place (a few mistakes).   The food was excellent, you could tell the chefs knew their stuff but the menu didn't try to over-confuse with complexity. All dishes were familiar but prepared to an excellent standard. Perhaps a bit overrated for the full price, but worth it for the pleasant surroundings.",

The food is fantastic and i can highly reccommend the steak tartare & lamb. I agree that the menu doesnt change that often, but 1. its not the kind of place you would necessarily go to (or be able to afford to) eat on a regular basis and 2. their food is great!! why tinker too much with what works and spoil it like so many other places can do!!!   The wine list is extensive, but a good tip is to pick the brains of the staff who i have always found very helpful and willing to suggest a good match for your food choice.   Although it may be a bit pricier than other restaurants i truly beleive The Witchery is the kind of place you get what you pay for and would reccommend it to anyone who asks.",

Hot damn, if you cut this place open it would bleed sumptuousness and over-the-top Tudorian splendour. I had a snoop around her accomodation - I can't even call it a hotel room, as it came with a shower and a kitchen. Champagne and chocolates, it sure beats Travelodge hands down. Four poster bed, covered in ornate heavy fabric furnishings, austere modernity in neutral colours, the Witchery laughs at you with disdain and waves a hand langourously to send such concepts to the local gaol. With views overlooking the Castle and Royal Mile, there is a price tag to match, but oh boy, I am envious of friends who can spend it. In fact, that is the only reason to drop a star - that common folk like me can only look on in envy.",

Making a rez for later in the day, when I arrived I was directed downstairs where the Maitre d' awaited me. Placing me at a 2-top near the kitchen, he proffered menus and left me to read. What a great selection of foods and drinks! Sheer delight in reading the wine list while enjoying a perfect Grey Goose martini led to several small plates, oysters of couse, and a wine to match each small plate. Wonderful experience, right until I noticed a detail in the tapestry next to me that showed a dog about to lick its gaping a**hole!!!!WTF!!! Jarring to say the least. I laughed out loud and wished I brought some narrow black tape...very expensive meal and a good chuckle to boot. When I left the Maitre d' said he was envious of my meal and was quite warm. It's not often I drop USD $200 on a meal, but it's Homecoming year and I was in Edinburgh for one dinner and this was the best, hands down. Enjoy!",

Sat at our table and was dazzled by the sun for about 20 minutes, luckily its the end of November so it wasnt too bad - shame there arent any sun blinds. We were downstairs facing the away from castle street. Menu had a good choice of food and the order was taken promptly. I ordered the vennison which was cooked to perfection but a side dish would be advisable. My wife had the three course meal, haggis was good but its first so nothing to benchmark it with. The oxtail fagot was plenty large enough so a quick swap of plates made up for the slightly small portion of vennison I ordered. Taking the desert order took far too long and also a very long time to arrive. Also took ages for the bill.   To sum up: the food was excellent quality, staff are polite, portion sizes are variable service started quick but slowed down significantly.   Would i come back? Yes Would i recommend? Yes   The bill said secret garden, the witchery. Not sure if there is any difference with the restaurant directly on castle street, this one was set slightly further back but adjoining the other one, staff said it is the same restaurant.",

The food is all locally sourced and if I were from Edinburgh it would make me very proud to know that a restaurant of this calibre existed in my city. I went there with my wife to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary and was not disappointed. First, the wine list is enormous and has very, very, fine wines from all over the world (I noticed a $6,000 bottle of wine!!). My wife and I decided on Champagne the night we were there and we had a large and prestigious selection to make our choice from. Next, the food. We were both impressed by the quality of the ingredients and the fact that it was all locally sourced. I started with a Shellfish bisque and then had a grilled Lobster from the Isle of Mull with a truffle sauce macaroni and my wife had a wonderful smoked salmon from Loch Duart (which, by a happy coincidence, is where her Clan's Castle, Maclean of Duart is located). Our desserts were wonderful. Hers was a burnt Cambridge Cream with passion fruit sorbet and mine was a Blairgowrie Strawberry and lemon verbena custard tart with strawberry sorbet. To top the meal off after our coffee we had to have some Scottish Whisky (when in Rome...) Hers was a Tobermory 10-year old (again the Isle of Mull theme) and mine was a Jura 16-year old. Lastly, the setting and the dining room ambiance is superb!",

    "text": "If you check my history, you'll see I don't often give low reviews. 1 and 2 star reviews, for me, are reserved for when I think it's important to offer would be patrons a word or two of caution.  We chose The Witchery for its ambience and we were not disappointed. The restaurant has two sections, each with separate entrances and no connecting spaces (completely independent dining rooms with independent staff). One is the new section and the other is the historical section; make sure to request the historical side (much more beautiful). If the entire review were to be about ambience, then this would have been 4 stars, but it's not just about ambience.  The food portions were so small that we were both still hungry for dinner after we ate dinner. As a starter I ordered \"Scallops and Mussels with broad beans and chorizo\", what I received was roughly a dozen beans, 1 small scallop, 1 very small mussel (sans shell), and a single small slice of chorizo which was then cut into quarters (when I say \"slice\" I mean it was a single slice from a sausage. It was 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) in diameter,  1/2 centimeter (1/4 of an inch?) thick, and then reduced to 4 rounded triangles once quartered). It was a ridiculously small starter.  For the main course I ordered a white fish, but received salmon instead; not what I wanted. I would have sent the dish back, but by this time I was quite hungry. The fish was a reasonably sized portion, but bland in flavor and completely forgettable; I don't even remember how the bed of white rice was seasoned.  For desert I ordered a strawberry dish with a wonderful description and I was quite excited to taste the treat; what I received was 3 strawberries cut in half and a single shortbread cookie ... again, completely disappointing and forgettable.  I love Scotch Whiskey and ordered a very nice Lagavulin 1995. I requested a double, neat - what I received was a skimpy singly shot of whiskey in a generic glass and it wasn't even the whiskey I requested. When I inquired, they insisted it was a double shot of the Lagavulin 1995, but as I said, I love good Scotch and this absolutely was NOT what I ordered.  Almost as soon as we finished our disappointing meal, the maitre d' arrived with the bill and informed us they needed the table to seat others and he encouraged us to pay the bill while he waited ... WHAT?!  Now, add to this evening the near complete absence of service as my water glass sat empty for the entire meal and received no refills. We were also afforded no opportunity to order a second round of drinks.  All in all, a truly unfortunate experience. Were it not for the beautiful setting, this would have been a 1 star review.  If you're thinking about going to The Witchery for dinner while in Scotland, I would like to encourage you to entertain nearly any alternative restaurant this beautiful city has to offer.",

We paid over 150 for four people...and two of us didn't even get full meals! The plates are rather small, so don't go if too hungry. Don't go if you have gluten allergies - their choices are VERY limited unless you like duck, octopus, or venison...when we entered, I think our expectations were high given the atmosphere but unfortunately, we were disappointed with our food portion to price ratio, having to wait 10 min for our waitress to come to the table to take our drink order and have to ask for the check after 10 min of having our plates cleared. We did vocalize our opinion upon receiving the check, but we were not compensated for our dissatisfaction.",

    "text": "The restaurant being the go to place in Edinburgh I had to review it.   The place itself was wonderful. The decor was just lovely, it was set over two separate areas, the original and the extension (I think), I went to the original part. I was sat in the corner behind a wooden separator. I must say for all its classiness, I did feel extremely out of place when I said no to wine to have not been offered any other alternative!   After a hesitation I then became very embarrassed to ask for which beers they served, if any at all (yes I did think that!), I am just very surprised that they didn't offer an alternative when I said no to the wine menu. Anyway I then asked for that menu, they have what I can only describe as a bible of wines. Their cellar must be huge. After fake-browsing the wine book I asked for a beer feeling quite ashamed at my lack of sophistication.   It's a shame I was made to feel that way.  As the evening went on the food was very nice and presented in a beautiful way albeit very small portions. Although I expect that from a \"posh\" restaurant.  We were however under waited on, perhaps caused by being behind the wooded separator... When we did want something I would have to poke my head around this separator and get someone's attention, but oh - don't disturb the short brunette in there because she's very frosty, perhaps the waiters are allocated tables and so I was calling over someone else's waiter? Anyway, not nice.  I really want to put 3 stars but Yelp class that with a caption reading \"A-Ok\" and I think it's a bit more then that, although there were a couple of down sides to my visit I would still go back and I'm sure it would have been better.",

    "text": "I had really high hopes for this restaurant as it was recommend by many people familiar with this restaurant and my dining preferences.  It is a beautiful room, we ate in the older wooden section, simply called the Witchery Restaurant, rather than the Secret Garden(was worried about the weather),    Reserved two weeks in advance online, could only procure 5:30 pm or 8:30 pm, and we wanted to eat early.  The restaurant did not really fill up until 7:00 pm, so I wonder why we couldn't have gotten 6:00 pm reservations.  We arrived early, and the kitchen did not open until 5:30 so we settled into a glass of white wine for my wife and a whisky for me....the Maitre D' rolled his eyes at us when we showed up.  When we did order, I think my wife had the crab cocktail, I ordered the Smoked fish from the Inverawe smokehouse for 13.50($21.75 or so, US) this is Loch Etive trout with Isle of Mull crab creme fraiche, eel with pickled cucumber, andhot-smoked salmon with beetroot puree.  It was very tasty, and literally two bites of each....for over $20.00, I would have preferred three bites.  For dinner, I'm pretty sure that my wife had the scallops, I requested the Rump of Borders roe deer, 27.00($44.00 US) Pommes Anna, roast squash, purple fig, wild garlic and chocolate oil....I made it very clear to the Maitre D' who took our initial order that I wanted the deer MEDIUM, not rare, as it has been my experience that for some reason these days, chefs prefer to serve game, pork and duck on the rare side, which I find unreasonably chewy.    It came out rare, and I sent it back, they took my wifes plate as well, which was very classy.  When it came back(about 10 minutes, right on time, afaic) it was delicious and my wife was EXTREMELY pleased with her dish.  I don't recall any amuse bouche.  For dessert, we shared a kick butt sampler, with about three items, they were all delicious and I had Armagnac to accompany it.  Would I go back?  Yes....I would check out the Secret Garden, and I would be \"firmer\" in my requests.  I had also checked my umbrella upon arrival, and they did not offer it back to me and I forgot it, and had to purchase a new one upon returning home.  Food was great, but definitely sized and priced to a European sensibility(smaller, expensive portions) and the service was lacking a bit.",

I had The Fillet of Scotch Beef Rossini which was nice but nothing amazing.The foies Gra was rich but definitely too much and to the distaste of some of my friends that I was partaking, but I did.  The star at this place is definitely the wine list, filled with an amazing collection that stretches far and wide and if it wasn't such a late booking we could have stayed (and payed) for many more bottles of liquid gold! And to top it off a dark Belgian chocolate tart,simply made no fine gold trimmings. It's definitely worth a visit once,you will pay for it but then you can say you did it!",

    "text": "What a disappointment.    I had been looking forward to going to this restaurant for years, and finally had a chance over the holidays.   I guess I would compare my experience to wanting to go out with that beautiful girl or handsome fellow, for forever, and finally getting that chance. This person at first, is beautiful, seems intriguing, alluring and you believe you will really hit it off. However, once you actually go out with that person, you realize that beyond that physical attraction, there is very little substance underneath and you know that you never want to go out with that person again. Such was my experience at the witchery.  Upon our arrival, the hostess was...well...curt....not necessarily being overtly rude, but not exactly welcoming.  Regardless, I set it aside and we were brought down the stairs into the Secret Garden. The candlelit room was stunning and dressed up for the holidays. It was quite an impressive setting.  However, it is the only reason why it gets two stars and it is also where the magic ends. Much of the remainder of our experience was just, blah.   Our waiter was not friendly, not rude, just sort of existing and did nothing to enhance our experience at the restaurant. In fact, nondescript is the perfect description.   We ordered off the three course fixed price menu. I ordered the cauliflower veloute; flat iron steak; and cheese course for dessert. The food was mediocre at best, with the cheese course being the best of the three dishes. The veloute was too salty for my taste and I needed a hack saw to cut though my flat iron steak.   We also had problems with the service of our meal. When one of our parties' steak was not properly cooked, we ended up finishing our main course when her steak was finally brought to the table.  To finish off this forgettable experience, at the time of paying our bill, the waiter overcharged us on one item---which to their credit was removed. However, we did not realize until later that the waiter took it upon himself to charge us in US dollars....for which there was a 3% charge for the privilege. The card I charged with does not charge a foreign transaction fee and therefore the 3% fee was completely unnecessary.   Certainly not the experience we were looking forward to.",

Perhaps I'm spoiled in Dublin with restaurants that have food with amazing taste and beautiful presentation for a bit cheaper... but still, come on. I don't know who they're fooling with a piece of chicken on a plate with mash. I definitely think they need to up their game before people realise their quality doesn't match their reputation anymore.   I also found it very irritating and cheesy that they menu listed celebrities who had visited the restaurant. A solid restaurant wouldn't have to boast such things...",

This food will not thrill your soul. It isn't art but it's well-prepared and presented, albeit in micro-portions at eye-watering prices. The service is decent. The decor is charming. The clientele are trying to show off. We just came in after a day of sight-seeing, a family of 6 with a tired 5 year old child who found nothing to eat that she could relate to. Unfortunate at these prices that children are welcomed but not in any way catered for. Try a little harder, Witchery. My husband was not amused at the paltry selection for vegetarians and the mini-glasses of beer sold at full price. Nothing on draught either. For one of the most exclusive and hyped eateries in town, this place is okay but nothing to write home about.",

She gave us the bill without asking if we need coffee after we finished our desserts! She had not only already counted 10% tips in the bill, but also added money for a trust without even a word.   I tried to persuade myself that what she did was for going back home early. But we were not the last table. There was at least 6 people having their main courses.  Had to say, we go to restaurants for pleasure. I feel so sad that an old and famous restaurant has an employee like her. And I can't recommend this restaurant due to my experience.  P.s.

My friend is vegetarian and she found it very hard to find something that doesn't include goats cheese, which she doesn't like. She ordered soup but was told that the wrong one was listed and the soup that was on offer surprisingly contained goats cheese! They agreed to leave it out of the soup but when it arrived it was quite under seasoned. I had beetroots with goat curd but they forgot the goat curd and had to ask for it. The portions were quite small. My friend ordered a main of courgette orzo served in a small squash which she really enjoyed and I had steak tartare which was nice. The vegetable sides were undercooked, the peas and chard being a little too crunchy. For dessert we had chocolate tart and creme brulee, both of which were excellent and by far the best course. The total bill was 103 including two gin and tonics, and a bottle of water.   It wasn't until we got home, we realised that my friends main course was missing something..we looked at the menu again and the feta and courgette fritter was missing!

    "text": "The Witchery will have the highest grade in presentation, just telling you now.  I'm not spoiling anything.  This is not a predictable plot with a Shyamalan-like fifth act twist.  By saying this early, I can make you wet your imaginative appetites (see what I did there) as you contemplate how this place could possibly look better that Inamo or Claridge's.  The Witchery matches Claridge's in their dedication to offering a fine dining experience over just good food.  I've been thinking about that, about how I prefer to have a dining experience.  I would never go out \"to get food.\"  \"Let's get something to eat\" would be replaced with \"Let's go out tonight.\"  This is why I haven't eaten fast food in five years.  I go out for the treatment and the experience as much as the food eaten.  As I sat down and took my first glance at the menu, I knew I was in good hands.  Our third water had come down with water after the second had brought the menus.  As the rain fell outside, we enjoyed the warmth of the Witchery. And then we ordered haggis. I know what you were thinking with that statement.  \"...and this was when it went downhill.\"  Haggis has a rather tepid reputation amongst westerners, squarely because of various negative images and connotations.  For me it, it was Highlander, where a French actor playing a Scotsman explains what haggis is to a Scottish actor playing an Egyptian.  When hearing that haggis was sheep's stomach stuffed with meat and barley, the Egyptian played by the Scotsman retorts, \"How revolting!\" But let's analyze what haggis really is.  To do that, you must come face to face with the realization that you've been eating its brother for most of your life. Sausage, it's the same stuff in a different package.  Where haggis employs a stomach, sausage uses intestines.  This process continues today, though most industrial manufacturers have cheapened out and switched to synthetic cases.  So haggis can be looked upon as just a sausage ball.  How much harm could come from that? You're probably thinking the other shoe is going to drop, but no.  The haggis was the first ordered, the first arrived, and was so overwhelming delicious that it sullied all dishes to follow.  The skin gave way the moment you scared it with the fork.  I'm so hooked on haggis now; I could eat it for breakfast, second breakfast, elevensies, luncheon, afternoon tea, dinner, and supper.  It was so good; I'd forgotten to take a photo.  I know; I'm naval lint.  The haggis was 9.50 and a bargain.  From there, we took in the d'Hote Menu, basically what we have been doing nearly everywhere else.  Between meals were offers of bread, the same as Claridge's.  My mother ordered wine to my water, the same as Claridge's.  Three courses were 30 quid.  Does that sound good?  It's less than half than Claridge's, so this place just got an A+ in value.  The actual starter after the haggis was offered as three options.  My mother elected for the grilled Irish oysters, pancetta, spinach, and hollandaise while I had the Tamworth ham hock en gelee, piccalilli, with grain mustard mayonnaise.  And you couldn't have a more complicated and more delicious way of saying \"spreadable meat and mayo on bread.\" We both decided the main should be the grilled gigot of new season lamb, rosemary potato cake, with aubergine caviar and tomato jus.  Alas, this is where the Witchery falters.  We must have been missing a point to this because the lamb was almost entirely fat.  It was a nearly inedible minefield of grizzle forcing us both to spit portions back onto plate like we were Gordon Ramsey in a kitchen nightmare.  The sides were good but this meal was ultimately a disappointment... what a shame.  In retrospect, I should have gone for my first choice, the butter-poached potato gnocchi with garden peas, broad beans, ricotta and mint.  The mean was redeemed with organic carrot cake topped with mascarpone ice cream blueberry syrup.  The Witchery was sizing up to be the greatest restaurant of the trip.  It did everything else to perfection, from service to decor, to every other dish.  It still gets extremely high praise from me because this one poor dish just wasn't enough to sour the entire experience.  I would definitely return.  I would also say that you won't regret going and should do so, just avoid the lamb. Food:  8/10 Service: 10/10 Presentation:  10/10 Value:  8/10 Recommendation:  9.3/10",

    "text": "One star for the ambience. Otherwise, zero stars. We start by getting seated by the maitre d' and without any menus yet, we are immediately asked what we want to drink. Not having given two seconds to think about it but also not wanting to disappoint him (wait...aren't I the customer?), I order water. My husband, on the other hand, straight up states \"I don't know. I need to see a menu.\" I swear this guy rolled his eyes before he leaves to get our menus. No exaggeration.   Ok we order our cocktails and not wanting to rush, I want to wait to order the wine. However, the surly, unsmiling waitress pushes us to order all at once. I said I'd like to get wine but to wait for the meal and she agrees. Next thing I know, our drinks and bottle of wine are coming out at once. I'm supposed to already taste the wine and then it will sit in an ice bucket until we get our food. Never in any restaurant that I've ever been to have they made me taste the wine before I was ready to drink it. It can mess with your pallet when you're in the middle of drinking something else!  Ok whatever. The food at least has to make up for the weird service, right? WRONG. Everything was either completely bland or way WAY too salty. No middle ground. No spices or flavor. Just salt or no salt. I probably would have let them know but no one ever came to check on us once the meals were out.   I was just so ready to get the bill but our waitress was too busy walking by our table and ignoring us.   Overall, we spent 2.5 hours and 200 USD on a pretty crappy night. I would absolutely never recommend this place besides walking in and getting a quick picture and then leaving immediately.",

When viewing the rooms on the website, they describe the standout features. I find that it is hard to choose because they do not reveal too much of each suite and there isn't a lot of photos to view. I chose the library suite as I love books.  For January the hotel were doing a slight discount and the room with Champagne and breakfast came to 245. A lot of money still, but a truly unique experience.  Roxy took my bag and showed us to our suite. We were told that Kate Moss loves the library suite as we walked up. We had the choice of a continental hamper breakfast or a cooked Scottish breakfast in the Witchery. We chose to have the cooked breakfast so that we could experience the Witchery dining. The breakfast was delicious and each item was high quality items. The room is very dark with candlelight. It can seem a bit disconcerting when going out into the morning light!",

    "text": "The Witchery is a restaurant with rooms.   5 stars for lodging (the Library room) and for the restaurant both!  LODGING: The Library room is exquisitely decorated and serviced (see their website for detail and pix). Although it is on Royal Mile, just steps from the Edinburgh Castle, the room is dead quiet (props to old stone buildings). The room is spacious and well decorated as a time piece, but not ostentatiously so. More thought should be given to adding closet space though. It is very clean and comfortable and WARM in these winter months. Complimentary continental breakfast arrives at the moment that was requested; delicious croissants, porridge in iron pots, and creamy yogurt were favorites.   RESTAURANT: We had dinner in the original dining room. We almost did not because of some of the less than positive comments in other Yelp reviews. I'm glad we did, though, because it was as if those disappointed yelpers had dined somewhere else.  Simply put, our dinner at The Witchery was one of the finest meals we've had anywhere. The room is well appointed, mysteriously quiet and candlelit. The service was comfortably impeccable. The lamb Wellington (served for two) was the tenderest of meats I've ever had, and deliciously prepared. The duck was equally tender and flavourful. The sides of whipped potatoes, ratatouille were sublime. The deserts - made to order bread and butter pudding and a variety plate of rhubarb sorbet, chocolate and other hand made delights was... delightful.   Don't pass this restaurant by - and stay for the night if you can.",

Traditional faire such as meat pies, haggis, blood sausages, etc. are done well. There are other michelin star worthy restaurants we ate at in Edinburgh but nothing beat the history or atmosphere of this place.  Situated in Old Town Edinburgh, right next to the castle, this was apparently part of the jail barracks centuries ago. Rumours abound of haunted spirits that were tortured in these gallows still roam this restaurant and surrounding buildings of the castle.  The inside of the restaurant was very small, romantic and quaint - most doors in the UK are tiny but this place reminded me of entering a Hobbit's home. I thought it was way too hot inside, despite it being below freezing and windy outside. It was hard to remove all my layers of clothing with such tight quarters.  If you only had one night in Edinburgh for the first time, I'd highly recommend going here.",

That said, I noticed that some of the less than flattering reviews focused in on the set menu items.  So, we stayed clear of those.  The wine list is incredible, but before we had wine, we wanted a cocktail.  While a hot toddy wasn't on the menu, our server quickly had one made for us - first service impression, excellent!  The service stayed on par the whole way through the evening.  Food was timed well, wine and water glasses were discreetly refilled.  Descriptions of the dishes and how they were prepared were accurate.  We had chicken and the filet of beef and both were so, so good.  The beef was especially outstanding, so flavorful and tender.  We dined in the secret garden area and it was beautiful, candlelit with little details everywhere.  Very romantic.  All in all, an incredibly good experience, would highly recommend!",

The idea was to go for the 35/head set menu after we'd ordered a couple of G&Ts. But, and it's a shame for them, it was uninspiring.   We then ordered steak tartar and lobster bisque followed by Pork and John Dory. To drink a reasonably priced Pouilly Fume.  The waiter provided us with some bread; considering this place is not cheap and the ambience wonderful you'd expect at least warm bread but ideally their own bread. What we got was poor.    The steak tartar was fabulous and my wife's lobster bisque perfect. The steak was perfectly seasoned and there was plenty. My wife's bisque was exceptional.   Our main course arrived and again both good. My pork with smoked mash was really good. The fish was very small but at least fresh and perfectly cooked.

There was no signage, so we ended up at the Secret Garden, and so did a couple behind us, when we all wanted the Witchery. So be mindful of the hidden entrance.  Anyway, we make it into Witchery...not a back spot, especially if youre into dark, throwback kind of spots...Dont expect a view as there were no windows down here....I didnt mind the decor, kind of playing off the name and the hotel and all, but just because you have a hades theme, you dont have to keep it as hot in there (it was really really hot)  I think my biggest disappointment with the Witchery was that I frequently order in batches, to slow the service down a bit...nothing I dislike more than having my plate cleared the second I take the last bite of something and then having the next course immediately delivered. As such, I will usually order apps, then soup/salad, then main course....So, there I am, 40 minutes after ordering some oysters for my app, still not enjoying my oysters. Finally I flag down the waitress to inquire about my only to be told that they cant do that and the whole order has to be placed at once or \"the chef gets mad.\"  So much for letting the customer decide how they want to eat. Pretty odd for a \"high class\" restaurant.  I understand about turning tables over and all, but we had an 830 pm seating, so I highly doubted there was another seating after us.    Anyway....the food.  After waiting 45 mins for the Oysters (to order), I was too hungry and hot to do the whole course dining experience, so I just went straight into the meal.  I had the pork chops.  The Pork Chops were good, very good, I just dont think they were worth ~$45 US (29 pounds).   My buddy had the venison and he said it also was good, but not amazing.  Because of the heat in the place, the time, and honestly, the lackluster looking dessert menu, we skipped dessert, so no comment there.  Overall, it was certainly an OK restaurant...a bit pricey for mediocrity, in my opinion...If you live here Im sure its worth checking out, maybe for the pre-fixe menus?  Traveling through, I may look for better?",

The stone floors and all-candlelight arrangement is so romantic and so lovely that you'll swoon while you're dining.  My meals included the stuffed chicken and the Loch Duart salmon.

    "text": "For a place with their reputation, the only acceptable review ought to be five stars, so the stars are theirs to lose. Thus this review will have a somewhat negative tone even though this was a very nice meal. Here are the two chief reasons I find it impossible to award them five stars: 1. The bread. It was nowhere close to the quality of bread I have had at much less reputable institutions. Is this what their mainstream clientele wants? I hope not, and thus they need to up the level of the bread significantly and it wouldn't even be difficult. 2. My daughter's scallops were served with a very nice tarragon sauce and nearly cold, unimpressive mashed potatoes. I have no problems with mashed potatoes, but even I can make better mashed potatoes, and serve it warm. (If this was truly the intention by the chef, then I guess we will just have to disagree on it being a good idea.) 3. This is a bit whiney but here we go: They were out of the vintage port wine by the glass and instead of corking up something else, they would only suggest that I go with the LBV instead. Nope. Not happening. But a True five star establishment would have opened some other bottle (or just make sure they don't run out). Having said this, here are some things they get right: 1. Very impressive wine list. 2. Very nice interior. We were in the \"Secret Garden\", so if there is a next time, we will try the original dining room. 3. Great (though not perfect) service. 4. My main dish of monkfish was delicious, as was the cheese plate, and the chocolate tart. So, if there is a second time, and I hope there will be, I expect them to have perfected their glitches and be a True five star experience.",

Their wine list reads like a belgian bars beer catalogue, reaching for 1cm of thickness. Sadly, they seem to lack a chef. The food was fairly prepared, but there was no richness of flavours, nothing going on in my palate... I've had a very similar venison burger in a pub. And at least there, it fit in the bun! Not a bad experience at all, but know you are going for the quaint atmosphere, the candles, the decor, and the wines. Not so much the food....",

    "text": "As evidenced by the reviews here, there are some pretty high expectations for Witchery. I was no exception. I had heard a lot of great things and was hoping for the best.  First I want to say that I think this is a restaurant that really knows how to space their seatings well. I believe they have three seatings a night, like 5pm, 7pm and 9pm. Something along those lines. This ensures you have enough time for multiple courses and dont feel rushed. It also means that you need to make reservations in advance to ensure you get the time you want.  I really love the ambiance of Witchery. The darker lighting really gives it a sense of drama and the decor and staircase decent into the dining room really makes a statement. I much prefer this over a bright, stuffy, all-white restaurant. The service here is formal, but not uncomfortably so. Our server was the perfect blend of 'there when you need him', but not obtrusive.  As for the food, we decided if we were going to do it, we were going to go all out. Bottle of wine, apps, salad, entrees, desserts - the works. Sure it is on the pricier side, but there are definitely more affordable options on the menu. I also felt that in comparison to the price you get outstanding quality. My scallops were like a little piece of heaven in a beautiful shell. My dining partner ate her grilled fish v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y so as to savor every bite.   Over all the combination of quality food, the intoxicating, enchanting setting, excellent service (and a good wine buzz) makes Witchery the sort of experience I crave when on vacation and I cant wait to return next time I am in Edinburgh.",

Or, if you are a visitor to Edinburgh, it would be a nice way to spend an evening: dining here, roaming up to the castle look off and wandering down the royal mile as the sun sets, onward to a whisky in a cozy pub. Mmm, sounds like a perfect night (or date) to me!   As good as it gets, in Edinburgh, for dining.   I'd give it the 5 stars except I've had better service at a chain restaurant. Our server seemed disingenuous. My biggest complaint is that the dude didn't know what wine would go best with scallops (which were fabulous).  At the most famous restaurant in Edinburgh, they really should school the servers on wine pairing!",

I mean, dont get me wrong - I went for a meal with my girlfriend (who had massivly high expectations) and was, over all a bit dissapointed. My girlfriend however, was not. I have therefor come to the conclusion that the Witchery experience depends a lot on how dark a shade your Rose Tinted glasses are.  I had heard how splendid this place was, and frankly for the money I paid, didnt feel that the food was of any more high quality than other restaurants in Edinburgh who have the same reputation but charge far less. My girlfriend however, who had built this place up so much that she 'knew' how excellent the Witchery would be, claimed that everything she saw, ate and drank was 'perfect'. As I said, I do believe this place is a matter of opinion.",

It has large windows and high ceilings so its like eating in a tower! The staff are ok, a bit faceless and not the level you'd expect for the amount you pay to eat here. The food is gourmet and beautifully presented but I think you over pay for the quality of the food. It's nothing to get really excited about.  At Christmas the decor is more than stunning and it becomes a christmas paradise. Overall it was a lovely experience but we were not amused to be charged 4.50 for what we thought was free water!!

(I'm so SPOILED being from San Francisco, where we have the best food in the world)...the salad course was fantastic.  The main dishes were good but not memorable.  The dessert was very good.

Ok the \"3 little pigs\", a lump of pig fat approx 2 inch square, uneatable, the \"loin\" was minuscule, and no we are not comparing to \"american\" portions.   The bacon was tooth breaking.

The friendly and knowledgeable staff, brilliant food and the venue is just about as good as it gets. The wine list really is a massive book (think encyclopedia not airport novel as a size guide)...for me I had to stick to the front...but if you have the money there is an amazing choice if you go back through the book.   It's an absolute bargain if you go for a pre- or post- theatre sitting.   Can't recommend it highly enough - if you are in Edinburgh, get yourself along there. Especially if you are after a romantic setting...although it's not just for dates, it's worth a visit whoever you are with.",

The fudge that came with the coffee was meltingly delicious and they seem to do bottomless coffee so if you have the chutzpah to come and enjoy the ambience and unlimited coffee with fudge for 5.95, you have all my support! Otherwise I think that the average diner for whom a restaurant with these price points is an extravagant treat is mainly paying for the maintenance of an extensive wine list you mostly can't afford anyway. I recommend the Northbridge Brasserie (at the Scotsman Hotel) for a luxurious meal that will be delicious in proportion to cost.",

    "text": "I have heard so many things about The Witchery and although it is near the castle, I was hoping that they have not fallen into the category where they charge extortionate tourist price for mediocre food quality.  Unfortunately, they have.    I ordered the steak tartare as the starter.  Presentation was great but I thought it lacked seasoning.  Of all the steak tartare I have eaten so far in Edinburgh, this has by far the least ingredients and seasoning.  I also felt it was a bit dry too.  This was priced at 12.50 and I do think that you can get a better steak tartare starter elsewhere for a cheaper price.  I had the Seabass as the main.  I have a picture and if you see the size of the fish, it is just too small to justify its price at 28.  The presentation - great but again taste was very bland. The fish was also not de-scaled properly and from the picture you can see 2 scales still left on the skin of the fish.  I eat a lot of fish and from the smell and taste, the fish was not that fresh at all.  I have been to its sister restaurant at The Tower and you get a whole seabass for the same price and it was the best seabass with brown shrimp I have ever eaten in Edinburgh.  This is just a plain rip off.  Creme Brulee as the dessert priced at 7.50.  From my picture, the portion is great and worth it but unfortunately, it came out as thick custard and not a consistency of a real creme brulee.  One of the lowest ranked creme brulee in Edinburgh for me.  The highlight of the whole experience for me was the mango sorbet that came together with the creme brulee.  However, the creme brulee was not sweet enough that when you return to eating the creme brulee, it just tasted even more bland.  Unfortunately, I have to rate this well known restaurant 2 stars - one star for ambiance and another for its service.  Sure, if you want to pay for the decor, ambiance and service this is the place to be to impress.  However, the quality of food and certainly its value for money has failed to impress me.  At a price I have paid here, I would rather spend my money at The Tower or a Michelin star restaurant.  Sorry Witchery, you have to do better.",

Candlelit dining rooms are great - but you couldn't see anything of the amazing room / decorations.  Highlights were the scallop appetizer and the filet main course.  Delicious!",

We ordered a honey truffle goat cheese that came without the truffle neither the honey! We waited around 20 min after appetizers and when we complained that the main course was not served yet,the manager approached our table to say that the computer is saying that its only been a 10 minutes wait and when we argued that it has been more and if its going to take much more time then we d rather cancel ,he said that if we r unhappy we can leave. Too bad such a great place is ran by an unprofessional staff.",

It was wonderful from end to end.  While yes a bit expensive, it was the full treatment for all of this.  I had fois gras, venison, the pudding assortment and matching whiskies and wines - every bit was worth it, delightful, delicious. The location implies tourist trade, but hell, I'm a tourist, and I've eaten at many fine places around the map, and this was up there.",

    "text": "I researched recommendations for local cuisine pre Edinburgh visit but made the mistake of not calling around for reservations until the night before. The Witchery was the only spot with availability. Service, if not exactly friendly, was the best of any restaurant I visited in Edinburgh. With that said, waters were not refilled and specials, if they had them, were not mentioned. Wine and food menus were delivered promptly. Romantic atmosphere. We ordered wine and I asked for Ketel on the rocks with an olive and a side of club soda, which made the waiter  look at me like I had two heads.  \"I'll ask at the bar,\" he said, his expression dubious. Like they don't have vodka and soda at the bar? Yea right. The head waiter stopped by to double check my order and then finally brought out all our drinks.  Overlooking the slow start, we ordered the Roasted Arran Beet Salad and Haggis, neeps and tatties for some local flavor. The Haggis turned out to be one smooth tennis ball sized lump of mystery meat on a bed of mashed turnips and potato. Turnips were delicious but I could only stomach a few nibbles of the meat turd and at $14 this was a pricey experiment. The Aran beets were beautifully plated but a tiny portion. For mains, we had the scallops with bacon and leek soup and Wild Mushroom Risotto. The soup was a hit bu the risotto was incredibly bland. Scallops were served with the bright orange foot attached which we thought was an odd presentation though both taste and texture were delectable. The mashed potatos had a ton of cream and butter so tasted great. The lettuce leaves in the side salad had long red stems attached which was super annoying.  We did not get desert. Overall I was underwhelmed. I don't think the food warrant the prices. You are paying heavily for atmosphere and I personally for one didn't think it was worth it.",

Prompt service except when getting the check, waited 20minutes after notifying waiter that we have eaten dessert and plates were cleared. However, I've noticed this trend in many restaurants in the UK. Only oversight in our meal was the truffle honey beetroots with goat curd, was missing the goat curd. It was just beets on a plate. However, I love beets so it didn't bother me. I had the ribeye with bordelaise sauce and for dessert, the creme brulee which was perfectly prepared and well worth the wait. I suggest getting it with the ice cream rolled in Cocoa. Overall, it was a wonderful experience and I would easily go back!",

The ambiance was amazing: the entire dining room was lit only by candlelight, with (what appeared to be) antique sculptures separating some of the center room dining tables.    The service was good.  Our food was lovely - not the best I have had (I am quite fussy and live in NYC so am admittedly a harsher critique than most), but it was very good.    The Witchery is clearly a local \"special occasion\" restaurant, full of polite and lovely patrons. We had drinks and wine and a couple courses, and our dinner came to around $250.  You will need to make a reservation.   I would visit again.",

    "text": "We went to The Witchery per the recommendation of a friend local to the area. I made my reservation in advance as advised which was good as the main seating area has around 15-20 tables. The interior is decorated beautifully with rich colours and candles. The entrance is just off the main road. The restaurant has two seating areas- the main witchery area and the secret garden. The secret garden has a separate seating area which can be accessed via a private pathway. Each seating area requires a separate reservation.   In terms of food our table ordered off the a-la-carte menu. My fellow diners thoroughly enjoyed their choices! The first ordered the lobster bisque to start and the halibut for their main and the second ordered the oysters to start and the venison for their main. They both commentated that their food was 5 stars and very flavoursome. I ordered the honey beetroot truffle with goat's cheese to start and the vegetarian moussaka as my main. The vegetarian food was ok but was a bit lacking for me. My starter arrived with the tinest piece of goat's cheese on it- for this to truly count as an ingredient it needs to be more present in the dish.  My moussaka though good- was more like a ratatouille just to manage expectations. We three shared a mashed potato and greens on the side which were both good. For dessert- we ordered Creme brulee and the chocolate tart with orange marmalade ice cream. The Creme brulee was absolutely amazing but I would pass on the chocolate tarte with organge marmalade ice cream. I only ordered it as the ice cream sounded unique and I love chocolate and orange combinations but the ice-cream did not taste orange to me at all.  We also ordered tea's which come with an assortment of small cookies and pieces of fudge. The tea's are Twinning's though...I think it would have been nicer to have had loose tea in a restaurant of this calibre and for 4.50 a tea pot- I felt I was paying more for the small shortbread cookies and pieces of fudge than the tea which I had wanted more. The service was good but needed to be slowed down a bit. They were extremely attentive - but at one point I was asked by 3 different people in the course of 2 minutes if my food was ok when it had just been served. Still- the servers were very polite and very nice. The service just needs to be slowed down a bit as I say.  Overall- I would return as was a very unique experience with beautiful ambiance. Next time-I will book a spot in the secret garden dining area for dinner as it looks a bit quieter and the entrance is all lite up beautifully at night with lights lining the pathway.",

I strongly suspect that there were simply \"no tables available\" for people dressed like tourists. So, if you ever go to Edinburgh, do me a favor: send a telegram weeks in advance requesting their very best table, get a written confirmation from the manager, then show up wearing sandals, shorts, and pit-stained American flag t-shirts and dragging large back packs, shopping bags, and duffles, tell them you wired ahead for a reservation and show them your confirmation letter, then ask if they have a kayak check.

The waitress looked and acted like she was in a bad mood and that made me and my partner feel a little uncomfortable but as the night went on and the food started coming out it started getting better. The waitress mood lifted and we went on to have a good night of food and drink. The bill was not as expensive as we thought so all in all a good night.  Its not a 5 star place but good at making you feel like your in a top restaurant. Defo recommend. The bill came to 150. 3 courses x2 , 2 cokes, bottle water, 2 ports and 2 coffees.",

Tons of amazing stuff to look at. - The location is ideal.  It's just steps from the castle, Whisky Experience, and Camera Obscura.  It's really easy to see sights, then have a nice dinner right there.  What's okay: - The food was uninspired.  It was okay, but we feel it didn't quite measure up to the ambiance and price.  For example, I was expecting something amazing from the flat iron steak, but the cut wasn't that tender and the flavor was pretty basic. - The service was uneven.  Some of the staff were very friendly and casual, and others (including our waiter) seemed competent, but a bit stiff.  Conclusion: If you want a fancy, romantic dinner in Edinburgh, and you're not a foodie, I don't think you will really go wrong with The Witchery - but you'll pay for it.",

The restaurant itself is beautiful and the potential is immense, however the food would be better at any Hard Rock Cafe and for a fraction of the price.

The tea was rich and beautiful and the finger sandwiches, cakes and scones were each an extreme delight. It was quite a lot of food for my husband and I, so we ended up skipping a full dinner. The tapestry lined walls and decor were really cool, I loved the feeling of the space. Waiters were attentive but at a distance which I liked. Get high tea here!",

For 39 pounds, one would expect a quality cut.  It was a supermarket cut steak that was difficult to cut with the steak knife, and was thin and chewy.  We should have sent it back.  My fish was excellent as was the scallops I ordered for an appetizer.",

I've walked by The Witchery many times on my visits to Scotland, but dismissed it as a likely tourist trap.  I was so wrong.   The atmosphere in the dining room was elegant.  Service was prompt, attentive and competent.    I opted for a three course lunch, starting with delicious Spanish charcuterie.  For my main course I indulged in a lovely wild mushroom risotto.  My meal was finished with a cheese plate.  All were very good.  Though in an area swarming with tourists, The Witchery is well respected by locals (such and my brother and sister in law).  I'm looking forward to my next visit.",

    "text": "We made our anniversary celebration dinner reservations here, based on a glowing recommendation by my Scottish colleague. Actually, I thought I had made the reservation at the Secret Garden part of the restaurant, but when we showed up, we were shown in to the main dining room, instead.  No matter, we were still awed by the view from the window (Edinburgh Castle, of course). Our waiter came hustling over right after we got settled, and went over the specials - including the tasting menu option - with us, before departing to give us a chance to look over the options.  Surprisingly enough, we decided to skip the tasting menu (I KNOW!) For my meal, I chose to start with the Roast Arran Beets, and the Cornish Bass for my main. My husband went with the Lobster Bisque for his starter, and the Caringorm Venison for his main. We paired our choices with a glass of wine, and chose to share the cheese platter for our dessert option.  I was very impressed by the food. The beet plate had a selection of different varieties, which was a good representation of how flavors can differ between varietals. My husband loved his lobster bisque (though he did say that it wasn't the best he's ever had). I was in love with the bass entree, though. It was perfectly made, and the flavor was incredible. The oxtail pot au feu - which originally made me cock an eyebrow - actually added a bit of depth to the dish. The sauces that finished off the dish were a nice addition, as well.  My husband rather enjoyed his venison meal, too. It was the first time either of us had seen black quinoa, but he said it tasted like regular quinoa to him. He certainly had no problems finishing off his dish.  The cheese plate was served with a couple of decaf lattes, and it all made for a nice ending to a wonderful meal.  The service within the restaurant was perfect - they were there when we needed them, but never hovered. They called a cab for us (because heels on cobblestone streets or on a downhill grade would have hurt me in so many ways), and kept us comfortable until it arrived.  The only thing that makes me sad about the night (other than the fact that we weren't in the Secret Garden, like I had requested) is that they never acknowledged our anniversary. I wasn't looking for sparklers and horns, but even a congratulations would have been nice.",

I had not noticed this in the past, must be cutting costs during the hard times. I was sitting close to the loo which is RIGHT in the dining area with the word TOILETS written on the door in plain sight of all the diners. Very classy. But apparently I was in very close to the stairs and in the way of the waiters who CONSTANTLY bumped into my chair and kept apologizing all night. Very unprofessional. When the waiter asked me how my dish was the only thing that come to mind was that the side dish, the veggies, were very nice with a nice butter and some seasoning and they were not over cooked which is typical of british veg. The waiter then asked how my fish was. I had not even thought about the fish when he first asked how my food was because it was so average and nothing special at all, my veg was more memorable. He seemed annoyed which just confirms my initial suspicion that the wait staff is very unprofessional and belong in TGI fridays more than a fine dining establishment. I saw that the witchery just won some award, cant remember the name, and its shocking! Yes, it is a beautiful place but what does that matter if the food is unmemorable and the wait staff just a joke? Says a lot about what people expect in this country when it comes to going out for a nice meal...",

    "text": "We came here to celebrate a birthday on a Sunday afternoon. I reserved the table about a month out, but it didn't seem like I had to. It's a really neat place with a lot of history, but the only lowdown I got on it was from the website and the back of the menu. I really wish that they would do a better job of telling you about the place to turn your meal into an adventure. Instead we walked in and went straight to our seats without seeing very much of anything.   Once you're in (we sat in the original dining room), you feel like you're in a basement. It was about 21C outside and the restaurant radiates and somehow multiplies that heat by a factor of 2, it was uncomfortable as it heated up because I love my air conditioning. It was a relief to get outside after the meal.   I started with the steak tartare, which I usually love, but this was quite chewy and more of an exercise for my jaws than food for my tummy. I didn't finish it. My main meal was the ribeye steak, which was an elimination process of what I didn't want to eat. It came with crispy chips. It was ok, but I am more of a filet mignon meat person, I like super tender and melt in your mouth steak, which this was not, but it was ok.   We had a couple of beers, a couple of wines, and another meal and starter and the bill came out to 150. Super expensive for the food that we got, so be aware you're paying for the atmosphere and service mostly.   Our server was fantastic and I would give him 5 stars (Blair). The decor is great and we felt like we were in a very special and old place, I give it 5 stars. The atmosphere could've been better because the speaker was right above our head and the classic jazz, 1940's pop and blues they played completely did not match what your eyes took in. I suggest they play the Game of Thrones music on repeat instead of their current play list.   I also noticed that the menu on Yelp and the menu I had that day was quite different. There wasn't much that I was excited for when I was there, but online the menu helped sell me on this place so beware. Overall, it's average. I'm glad I tried it based on the history, but I'd never come back.",

RSVP is needed and I think sitting in the main entrance dining area is best away from the door(just in case it's cold you don't want that draft). They have dining areas down the stairs from the host station. Did not know that till after dinner.   Service was good, but not great. I really enjoyed the food though. They charge for still water by the way so, don't be shocked at that. It was not a cheap dinner if you convert to USD lol.  I would go back again just for the delicious foie gras and sourdough bread!",

The greens were a good balance for my tastes. I'm glad I came and experienced the beautiful setting. Keep in mind this is just an experience and not worth the price of the food unless you are only here for one night that is.",

The seating area is dark and gloomy, which is very appropriate considering the medieval castle located up the hill.   I enjoyed the haggis with neeps and tatties. It was flavorful with a lovely spiciness. The lamb Wellington for two was presented beautifully and tasted delicious. We were pleasantly surprised to be served Glenlivet mineral water along with our meal. It went along well with the whisky theme of the Scottish leg of our Eurotrip.",

It is dark, woody, elegant medieval candlelit romanticism with total  attention to detail from the menu, the extensive and incredible wine list and the decor. Think White linen tablecloths, napkins tied with red satin bows . Service was attentive and excellent in every way without being intrusive. We started with a cocktail and wine with a wonderful selection available. Next came their wonderful sourdough bread with creamery butter followed by fresh oysters, and a delicious pea veloute  with crispy bacon served with these crazy good little cheddar scones. For the entrees we enjoyed the scallop entree with crispy bacon & pea veloute sauce  and the venison with root vegetables and a small smear of mashed potatoes. The delicate sauce decoration was sublime. We added the roasted carrots which had  small dollops of yogurt sauce with cumin. No room for dessert but they have some good ones! Loved our evening here but trust me you Need A Reservation!!!  AND The other location right next door down the narrow pathway like the  \"Secret Garden \" looks amazing but we could not get in even with a three day window. Just Do it, dine here at the original Witchery, the secret garden or at their newer location (The Tower). You will not be disappointed while here in Edinburgh.",

So basically the food is Okay. Prices high.  The setting  and service are perfect. I especially found service to be spot on with apt timing and pleasantries.  All four of us opted for the pre-fixe  menu at 40  and it's not unreasonably priced. My first course was fine but felt very prefabricated hotel style.  The entrees were really good; excellent lamb, potato, and veggie.  The desserts save for the cheese plate felt very hotel premade.  Alas you come here for the setting and it's wonderful. Set in a 16th century house with dark and gothic accents it was fun.  Music selection is fantastic from Puccini to Celtic harp versions of U2 songs..I loved it.  Wine selection is insane here with a book listing 700 various bottles: anything from a 1992 Lafitte rothschild ( tipping in at a wallet busting 900) to lovely Malbec and Shirazs in the  30-40 range ( more my tier).  All in all come here expecting okay expensive food in an incredible surrounding with great service.",

The Secret Garden has an intimate setting (good for small groups 4-5 people and dates), lavish velvety decor, and delicious food. The champagne, rose, and whiskey were refreshing. All of the dishes exceeded expectations:  - Curried pineapple chutney, swede, and potato bhaji (without haggis) - similar to an Indian style onion pakora, very nice of our server and the chef to make this vegetarian for us - Honey roast Arran beets with burrata  - Organic Phantassie farm mixed leaves  - Organic peas veloute with cheddar scones  - Foraged mushroom risotto with truffle oil  - Parmesan and tomato aubergine - Roast fillet of Scrabster cod  - Coconut tapioca for dessert. Nice finish! And also lactose-free.   Service was phenomenal! The hosts especially Oliver as well as the waiters including Paolo were so friendly, made great conversation, and were very helpful with local recommendations. Locals were also fond of this restaurant. Very memorable experience. Nect time I'm in Edinburgh, I would love to return here!",

We had a variety of food - lamb, haggis - but the standout dish was something we almost missed because we were quite full at the end of our meal - the orange chocolate flourless chocolate cake. This dessert made me wish I lived in Edinburgh so I could eat it every day.  The location is magical. It feels like you are royalty walking into a castle. While you are dining at the Witchery - you are treated like royalty from start to finish. Every dish we had was excellent. This is a place you can come to with family and friends or visit on a date night. I did see children dining as well, although I cannot speak to a kids menu. Honestly, I couldn't be happier with my visit.",

The lamb was probably the best lamb I have eaten ever. It was tender, flavorful, and was perfectly prepared. The service was great and the wine selection recommended by the Sommelier was on target.

The scallops were slimy and undercooked. The Lamb Wellington meal for two was AMAZING!!!! I can't put into words how perfect it was.    The hostesses were very accommodating and friendly. The wait staff worked together extremely well and were very attentive. The Manager however had no personality. He was absolutely in the wrong profession!!!  If you have the extra money and want the experience of eating there, you will not be disappointed! If you're on the fence about it, skipping it wouldn't be the worst thing!",

Best wine menu I think I have ever seen, although a bottle of wine I had the previous night somewhere else was 15 more expensive at the Witchery. We dined in the Garden Restaurant and it was lovely, really romantic, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for that real romantic dinner, a special occasion. It is very expensive though if you are dining a la carte so beware. Overall here, you are paying for the name of the place, the reputation, service and ambiance. The food is excellent but saying that, I didn't sample the full menu and I would say the food is secondary to the overall experience of it.",

Walls covered in 17th century wood salvaged from the nerby StGiles Cathedral, comfortable furniture and just enough candlelight to make a romantic dinner perfect. What else? A lot of famous people visited and ate there - Michael Douglas, Cathrine Zeta-Jones, Matt Groening, Jacques Villneuve, Jack Nicholson and many others that I can't remeber right now! Moving on to the menu - the card changes every night but there are several positions to choose from, all made superbly to make you feel special. A vide range of wines and champagnes, plus many other things to drink.  But there are bound to be some minuses too: - service is very caring and active but looks a bit tired and more formal than friendly - no drink card (you have to ask about everything and dont see the prices before ordering) - very little space inside (table are squshed one next to another which doesnt make it very intimate) All in all worth of trying but be prepared to spend at least 50-60 pounds per person!",

They offer a lunch/theatre menu for like 13 pounds and have a three course set menu for 30. I got a starter of soup for 7 and a main course for 15. My husband went for the seafood platter (35 pounds) and it was a ton of food. He couldn't even finish it. I would say you can make your meal here as expensive or as cheap as you want to. I also didn't find the portions to be extremely small. But, I have been to high end restaurants and knew what to expect. Overall, I would definitely go back to this restaurant for a special event.

Granted, we had a booking for 2pm, which is towards the end of a lunchtime shift and so the staff and chefs are all tired and a bit frazzled. But when you're paying Witchery prices, you don't really expect that to be an issue - if we'd wanted that we'd have gone to one of the million cheaper places to eat on the Royal Mile.  The portions were tiny, even by upmarket restaurant standards. However, I don't think this was down to them running out of stock - after speaking to other people who've eaten there it seems that that's just they way they do it here.  Which would have been fine, except mine was lukewarm. It was one of those puff pastry and roasted sun-dried tomato with goat's cheese type things that you get in most pubs these days, and the cold slimy tomatoes didn't really do much for me. In fact, it was probably quite a good thing that there wasn't much of it.  At least half of the pages in the menu are taken up by testimonials from celebrities writing about how they loved the place, followed by the Witchery's own epic autobiography, but I honestly think they'd do a lot better if they concentrated less on their image and more on what they're actually serving people.  I wouldn't rush back.",

The bathroom has a huge, gorgeous tub, perfect for a long soak after walking around Edinburgh all day.

We also showed up to a chilled bottle of champagne which was very exciting and an amazing way to start out our trip.  We only stayed here for 1 out of our 3 nights in Edinburgh because of the 295 per night price tag but like I said it was well worth it.  You absolutely cannot beat the location-we stayed here the first night and it was the perfect spot to help us get acquainted with the city-we could see the castle from our doorstep and the rest of the Royal Mile was right there at our feet.  You also get a continental type breakfast delivered to your room in the morning-the huge, buttery, chocolaty croissants were my fav!  Great experience-if you have a little extra to spend, definitely give The Witchery a try!",

    "text": "A beautiful setting very close to Edinburgh Castle. I thought it would be very busy with tourists but it wasn't. We ended up going for the 3 course set menu which is very reasonably priced. The staters were great. Delicate and flavoursome. The main also matched this and the jus that came with the Glasgow Steak was incredible. The meat was a tad tough and the copper pot it was served in made it extremely difficult to cut into and eat from. Great dish to look at but I just wanted to get into it. As always I got the cheese board. Nice range of cheese also sourcing locally where they could. Even though we had 3 courses we didn't leave full. The dishes tended to be on the small size. Also the service was attentive to start but maybe inexperienced as when our drinks came to the end we never got asked if we would like another. Not too much of a big deal as it was the middle of the day and we didn't want to drink that much. (Visit - 02/01/2015 Lunch)",

I ordered the fixed price 3 course for 35 pounds.  My starter was red mullet on cucumbers with potato salad. The potato salad was mediocre at best and I didn't finish the mullet. I enjoyed my roast chicken main but given that it was called pot roast on the menu I expected potatoes and carrots... A roast of some kind... Dessert was a dry pistachio cake that lacked a theme between that and the rhubarb stalk laying next to it. My 3 girlfriends had the same experience... One not even finishing her main. The service was bad in that they were completely absent. When they were available it was ok....but overall Serious lack of attention making it the worst service at this price point I've ever experienced.  I had some excellent meals in Scotland but this was the worst $60 USD I've ever spent-ever. I would take it back if I could. Save your money.",

    "text": "I went to this place for the lunch, since it was recommended in many guidebooks and by many people. I have to say, I was a bit disappointed. The 2 course lunch deal isn't 12.95 anymore, it is 15.95, meaning it is about $25, that is not really cheap. I know I know, you go there for the atmosphere, but for $25, I expected better food. And like other people are saying, bread were cold. How disappointing. And they pressure you to get wine. Since I was there for Fringe festival and I didn't want to drink before the show, I declined the offer but they kept asking. Here is the thing, don't pressure your customer to buy anything, or they will not come back. And Andrew Lloyd Webber said this is the prettiest place... well, I have seen better. It is pretty, but it didn't take my breath away. Also, since it was the midst of August, lots of family with kids were there too so I guess it is kids friendly.   What really infuriates me is that the price for bottled water and TEA!!!!!! 5 for Glenlivet Speyside mineral water is a bit much, but 5 for a pot of tea, and I mean POT OF TEA, and tea bag is a regular TWININGS ENGLISH BREAKFAST!!!!!!! Can't you at least use loose tea leaves? And something a bit more fancy? Like Fortnum and Mason??? I felt like I got raped when I saw that on the bill.  FYI if you ask for a water, they will give you the 5 mineral water, so you may want to specify tap water, or whatever they call tap water over there. Unless, you are cool with paying 5 for a bottled water.",

    "text": "With all of the talk about this place we had to go here while visiting Edinburgh from the US. As such, considering the pedestal this place has been put on, I've taken a different approach to grading The Witchery. I call it the \"benefit-of-the-doubt' rating system. Goes like this...I gave it 5 stars before I even sat down. Then, took away and added stars as the meal progressed. So, the stars were their's to lose.   Went there for lunch....results:  Ambience - Excellent. Let me just say that this place is spectacular.....out a movie set or fiction novel. But, it's very real and in a beautiful 16th century historic building. A very cool and other-worldly ambience. We sat in the Secret Garden area downstairs...loved it....no stars lost.   Service - Fair. Attentive when they were around. But, too slow for me. Big delay between apps and main course even though we were the 2nd table seated. Overall, took 2 hours for lunch and we were never offered anything else to drink after our initial drink orders...not even water....had to ask for everything...1 star lost.  Drinks - Excellent. Judy had a Pimm's, wife had a glass of sauv blanc and I had a Hendrick's Martini with a cuke garnish. Plus, after-lunch cappuccino's were excellent...1 star awarded (they're back to 5 stars!).  Apps - Underwhelmed. A selection of bread and butter was served. Bread seemed day-old and cold but tasted OK. I prefer warm bread. Wife had oysters on the half shell and they were reported to be good. I had a seafood bisque and it was presented nicely in an iron pot with crostini (croutons) and parmesan and rouille on the side. But, it was a vey thin soup that didn't have a distinct flavor....I'm sure it was a lot of work but it just tasted like some basic fish stock. I usually think of a bisque as being thicker and richer but this may just be a cultural thing. It was neither good nor bad....1 star lost.  Main Course - This one is tricky. Kids split the roasted chicken with fondant potato and green beans and chips on the side. My wife and Judy got the roasted, hot-smoked salmon with sweet potatoes and green beans. My mother-in-law Mary and I both got Guy Grieve's scallops w/ pancetta and whipped potatoes. Here's the rundown...kids' chicken had good flavor but was very dry....seemed like it may have sat for a while. Their chips were very good, though. The salmon was reported from wife and Judy as being simple but very good. Seems like it had a lemon/butter-based sauce with it and served with green beans. They really liked the dish. Everything about the scallop dish was mediocre. Whipped potatoes were cold (ok, luke warm), scallops were over cooked or had been sitting under a salamander for too long. Pancetta was hard and chewy. Salad was not memorable....1 star lost.  So, it was an OK experience in the end. My wife and Judy enjoyed their meals. Mary and I didn't. All agreed the service was not the best. But, all agreed the ambience was outstanding. Would go there again for dinner because this place is so special but with the hope of a better food experience.  I",

    "text": "So it was the boy and I's first time in Edinburgh and we were on a traveler's budget. I had read wonderful things about the Witchery's food and ambiance, but knew the dinner menu was way too pricey for us, so we decided to head over for the (much more reasonably priced) lunch one day instead.  The atmosphere is delightful, as other Yelpers have attested, and would make for an excellent special occasion meal (but suited us just fine for a nice lunch while in town). Service was flawless as you'd expect in such a place (although to be fair, it wasn't exactly packed as it was a weekday around 2), everyone was wicked friendly and every staff member who interacted with us was professional, kind, and very cheerful. Of note is the bartender who cared enough about his drinks/customers that he came over to discuss what kind of liquor to use in the boy's Manhattan (he recommended Whisky, which ended up being delicious, and was even the same price as the normal Manhattan, 8).  In a beautiful setting like this, often the food takes a back seat to the ambiance... but I'm happy to say we were quite pleased with the food (love love love the commitment to locally sourced ingredients!). The boy chose the reasonably priced (15.95) 2 course prix fixe lunch with the pea and ham soup and the venison burger, and I deviated at the last minute and went with the pricer smoked grilled Scottish salmon on the normal menu (because really, if you're a fish eater and don't have salmon while in Scotland, you are definitely missing out). I was in heaven with my own meal, that salmon was soooo fresh and flavorful, with a nice smokey flavor and grilled perfectly, accompanied by delightful sweet potatoes and green beans. Totally worth the 21 splurge. The boy was similarly happy with his meal, the soup tasted like the peas were just shelled a few minutes before, and the venison burger had a great flavor (he especially liked the cranberry relish). Even the complimentary bread and butter were tasty (that butter was so fresh, mmm).  All in all, we had a great meal and would recommend it to anyone looking for a cool/romantic atmosphere and excellent food for lunch.",

    "text": "I'm extremely behind in posting this review but I couldn't not review it! My boyfriend and I were on vacation in Ireland and the UK in August when on a train trip from Dublin to Belfast, I sat by some locals. After telling them where all we were traveling they said we had to eat here when in Edinburgh and that it was pricey but a great place to celebrate. Turns out by the time we got there, we had something to celebrate! After Belfast we were in London where my boyfriend proposed. So our celebration dinner was at The Witchery. It was, by far, the fanciest restaurant I've ever been too. The wine list was crazy long so they also had a wide price range too. We had the wood partridge as an appetizer, how can you not when it said to take care when eating as it's wild game and may have shot still in it! It was definitely good. For our entrees we had the Scottish Salmon and the duck. All excellent. The only negative thing - and this is not their fault of course - the place is small with tight quarters and for the bulk of our meal there was a mom with her two kids (American I embarrassingly admit) and the daughter talked SO LOUD about everything that was going on with their life. Basically everyone in that part of the restaurant could tell they had a lot of money with the things she was going on about. Anyways, we were celebrating our engagement so I refused to let it put a damper on our evening. The food is fantastic, the atmosphere is definitely romantic and intimate so if you have something to celebrate I would check this place out. Be sure to make a reservation regardless of the time of year.  We probably wouldn't have found this place had it not been for the nice Irish girls I sat next to on the train so thank you to them!",

The ebb and flow of volume was intriguing!  Service - fantastic.  Our favorite was when we asked for a wine reco.  I'm not sure who the expert was who came over, but made some suggestions, and we went with a New Zealand red that he seemed to like more than the more pricey wines.  It was I think under 30 pounds--quite cheap for this restaurant.  Anyway we loved it.  The Scallop hors d'oeuvre was incredible.  We wished we'd gotten 3 each for our dinner...but alas, we had one.  For dinner we had the Wellington, because it was recommended highly by two of my friends.  I was only disappointed because it was 80 pounds.  It was good, and fed both my girlfriend and I...but I'm not sure it was \"80 pounds good\".  It did come with two sides: we chose Mashed Potatoes and Green Beans, which were both very good.

Even my Dad, a hard to please foodie, raved about the quality of the food.  The decor and ambience is unusual with a gothic feel and low lighting, however this created an intimate, relaxed atmosphere and it made us feel like we were escaping from the real world for a while. It would be a fab place to go on a date - the flattering lighting is an alternative to beer googles.  We all had the haggis starter and I've yet to have bad haggis but this really was extra tasty. I then had a generous fillet of salmon and it was ridiculously delicious. I eat salmon quite alot but this was by far the best I have ever had, I was going on about it for days. 'Remember that salmon... '  I was too preoccupied with my life-changing salmon to really notice what my family were eating but I do remember my Dad thoroughly enjoy his faggots (yes, really).   I'm a real sweet tooth but the main course I had (salmon, salmon, salmon) was very filling so that was the end of my Withchery culinary experience. This place is a real treat and worth every penny, the food and service were wonderful. They also had Molton Brown handwash in the ladies room, I like that sort of thing :)",

The food was ok and I suppose the price is reasonable. The issue is this:  - When the menus came, our waiter explained the courses to my husband but did not offer me the same courtesy.  - When I ordered a glass of wine and my husband ordered water, the wine was served to him and not me.   - When the check came, it was brought directly to him (though I had asked for it, as I was paying).  Just because a restaurant is old-fashioned doesn't mean it has to be sexist. Quality service does not need to be gendered.

Of course, that comes with one of the most expensive meals we've ever had (if not the most--the poor dollar/pound rate doesn't help), but it was worth it for the special occasion.   We both got the three-course meal, picking different options so we could try most things. That included scallop cassoulet, chicken and trout entrees, and then lemon tart and rhubarb savarine for dessert. Everything was fantastic--we didn't leave anything on our plates.   We started with cocktails; my gin martini was quite good, and while her French 75 was a bit too sour, they were happy to fix it.

We also ate at their restaurant, and were not disappointed. Delicious food and amazing wine in a very intimate and well-appointed dining room. Our waiter, Seoridh, helped us navigate the extensive wine list and choose a bottle that complemented our meal perfectly. We will definitely be back the next time we visit the city.",

We opted for the the set 30 three course menu, and It is some of the best food ive ever tasted!! I could not fault it and the desert was the best ive ever tasted...I normally think lemon meringue is boring...but i was intrigued by lemon meringue sundae?!! Soooooooo glad i tried it!! I really cannot explain how good it was...they have some top chefs working in that kitchen! We stayed for Tia Maria coffee and have some tablet, i was completely full! They also have an extensive wine menu and when they didnt have any Pinot Grigio the tried to get a similar one and allowed us to taste a couple to see it they suited.  Cannot fault the staff and the dark candle lit tables were sooo romantic!! ( although i was with my mum) was be a great place for a date!!  I would go back tomorrow! If you are unsure choose the 3 course set menu..you wont be dissapointed !!",

    "text": "Sadly this is a shadow of its former self. So much has gone downhill -- except the prices -- that this once outstanding spot is now a to-be-avoided tourist trap.  A simple meal for two will cost about 200 with wine but the service will be about what you'd expect of a nando's. Different servers and indifferent other types pop by the table about once every thirty minutes whether you need something or not.   The Sommelier poured about 200ml in my glass, which I had to send back. The starters were still a good 20 minutes away.   In short: food tasty but overpriced. Service worst I've ever seen at this price range.",

I wasn't sure if the kitchen had run out of arborio or if this was standard practice and either way I want to make management aware that, while the wait staff were fantastic, I was very let down by my fake risotto.  He never got back to me.    Specifically, I emailed someone who got back to me saying \"I'm sorry you didn't enjoy your food\" or something along those lines, and saying they would pass my email onto the general manager.  It was the general manager who never responded.    I felt this was an incredibly poor way of handling a customer who was previously mildly put off but is now really unimpressed.",

    "text": "The setting is magical and the ambience is very romantic.  Lots of dark areas illuminated with candlelight.  The staff are super efficient and not in your space so it makes you feel at ease in this posh place.  We had the lunchtime set menu 18.95 for 2 courses.   To start the pea and mint volute with Mull of Kintyre scones, delicious and a really good size starter.  We also had the Scottish & Iberico cured & smoked meats again tasty.  Main course Hachette of Cairngorm venison with duck egg, this was ok but basically a posh burger without the bun.  Skate wing with black butter, lovely.  For pudding we had The Witchery pudding selection, this had 5 small potions of creme brulee, sorbet, chocolate cake etc this was fab and although 11.50 the deserts were gorg and worth the price.   On the negative side- when they brought the desserts out although I had my place setting for pudding, no dessert was brought for me.  I do feel if they had been on the ball they should have picked up on this mistake they had made.  I did get an apology when I pointed out the error but considering the amount of waiting staff and the high expectations this should have not happened.   The timings between courses was just right but we had been sent a text the day before  advising we only had the table for 2 1/2 hours due to other bookings.    This place Did not live up to the high expectations I had.  I did enjoy the meal but I have had better and although it did not break the bank, I've had better for less.  I have marked this restaurant 3 but it borders on 4 stars ars as it was so pretty inside and I loved the aesthetics. Xoxo",

    "text": "I recently got treated to a very nice meal here. Overall, it was a outstanding and very romantic experience. As we walked down the tiny alleyway to the entrance of the restaurant you can't help feeling slightly whimsical. Our table was reserved in the 'Secret Garden' section of the restaurant.   I do have to agree with Jonas B. below on the bread situation. I had tomato and rosemary focaccia which was good but I think you can expect better at restaurants of this calibre. I had foie gras as my starter - which you don't see on too many menus here. It was heavenly. For my main I had the hot smoked salmon. My partner had a fillet of limousin Scotch beef which included grilled marrow. We were both impressed with our meals. We shared an excellent bottle of Chenin Blanc and creme brulee for dessert.  We were offered complimentary espressos and a latte which came with macaroons and fudge. The macaroons were somewhat stale but the fudge was divine.  I think the restaurant does really well because it presents a really lovely atmosphere and experience. I've been to fine dining restaurants in other cities and there's a magical element to The Witchery that other places lack. I suppose being in the backdrop of the castle helps!  I would love to come back for lunch when there's natural light shining through as the restaurant is fairly dark (this isn't a criticism, I liked it dark).   I found the service excellent - not too inquisitive on how our meal was. Very professional and knowledgeable.   We finished our meal around 11ish and there were a few tables that were just being seated. I'm not sure if they regularly seat such late (for Edinburgh) diners but this might be something to take note of for future reference!",

    "text": "I admit I had been wanting to visit and dine at the Witchery for years. I think I read about it in Victoria magazine like 15 years ago or something. Not sure what I was expecting but as it is pretty upscale I thought the food would be amazing. Sadly it was not. I have no complaints, but like Carrie S, I found the meal to be \"meh\". Just OK. Well presented, everything was fresh, it just lacked flavor or oomph. No innovation at all. The service was impeccable, and although I was disappointed that we couldn't get into the Witchery proper, the Secret Garden was very pretty and atmospheric.   Not sure what another reviewer is talking about by saying good food in Scotland is rare. Everything we had in Scotland no matter where we dined was excellent, from inexpensive teas to seafood dinners. Although the Witchery is a beautiful restaurant it actually didn't stand out as one of the better places to dine in Edinburgh, which is a bit sad, but that being said I can't say that the food was bad.",

    "text": "This is pretty much exactly the fancy sort of place you expect/hope it would be.  I'll start by saying we ate in the lower garden area and not in the older upper wooden section.  My mother was disappointed by this until she checked out the upper section after we'd finished.  It was hot as could be in the wooden area and pretty cramped.  SO in the end I was happy we ended up where we were.  Definitely on the expensive side but you should already know that going there.   A massive wine list, good food... sometimes great food, and a really nice atmosphere.    TIP:  Try and see if you can have your meal end on or around 10:30pm.  One of the greatest moments of my trip to Edinburgh was standing in the little Witchery doorway and watching an army of bagpipers march right by us, within inches.   If you're there when the Royal Tattoo is in progress you might be lucky enough to see it.   I found it far more impressive than the actual Tattoo itself.",

    "text": "As I've always wanted to go here, my fiance surprised me by taking me the The Witchery for my birthday this evening. Maybe I came in with incredibly high expectations but I found that the hype of this place far outweighs what you get. I was not particularly impressed with any dish I received, to be completely honest. While the restaurant is not \"bad\" by any means, it seems as though it's coasting on a name, rather than the quality of the food. The Witchery seems to do food that is very classic, which is great if that's what you're looking for. However, I was expecting the classic food to have something which set it apart from other restaurants like it. In short, I saw nothing like that and was served a few fancy looking dishes that were not nearly the calibre of food I would expect from a place this \"legendary\" or in such a price point. I have eaten at several world class restaurants and have experienced better dishes at a fraction of the price in more cosmopolitan hubs (Vegas, NYC, etc).   Not only that, but I found the service to be dismal overall. The servers were very kind but not attentive enough. I recognize that there can be a cultural divide between American (which I find far too hands on) and British service but this didn't even begin to straddle the line. We were left to our own devices with only a check in every half hour (if that). The last straw, which I'm not sure was intentional or not, was that I wasn't asked if i wanted my credit card charge to be in dollars or pounds. For most people this isn't a big deal, but I travel enough to know that establishments make extra money if one pays in foreign currency...I would think a place of this calibre would know exactly what they are doing when hey run something like that, which I find dishonest.   The Witchery gets extra points for acknowledging and doing something sweet for my birthday but overall, I'd recommend people look to other places in Edinburgh for great food. This place seems like a tourist trap that's lazy bc of their legacy. Personally, I felt it was a waste of money.",

Unfortunately she made a wee mistake about our booking time and we were late and they had given our table away, sad faces, not for long they rustled us a table on the terrace which was sublime as it was a very lovely sunny afternoon. A wee glass of Champagne to kick off the celebration. We chose from the two course pre-theatre menu for 18.95 very good value, Irene had Hot smoked Loch Duart Salmon with Arran beets horseradish & watercress salad, I had Scottish & Iberico cured & smoked meats both very appealing to the pallet. For mains I had Macaroni with Orkney Lobster & Nantua sauce, Irene chose Seasonal Wild Mushroom Risotto, I have never had lobster with pasta before and it was very nice the sauce was beautiful, I am not a mushroom fan but had a wee taste of the risotto and it was truly delicious. Another glass of champagne and we were done, no room for pudding, we sat back in the sun and relaxed nobody rushing us and walked up the Royal Mile to be entertained a very lovely afternoon & evening cheers big Sis",
