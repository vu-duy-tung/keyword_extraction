I am not one of those kind of people, so I was a bit worried it would be pretentious and toffy nosed like a lot of bars in Edinburgh. I was wrong.  Even though I was only meeting a friend in here to grab some Uni notes from her, we decided to have one drink and soak up the atmosphere, which was really cool and relaxed, and thankfully, not at all stuck up!  We shared a bottle of wine, which was reasonably priced at 13 and hung out there for a good two hours without anyone batting an eyelid or looking at us in anticipation of us leaving, even though it was busy. Loads of people were having food and everything being brought past us smelt great!  I might go back for dinner some night but I would definitely go back for a quiet relaxed drink! Great pub!",

    "text": "Much more of a bar serving food than any of the other similar places like this nearby, as opposed to a restaurant that serves drinks. As a result, its more relaxed and laid-back than places like the Cellar Door or The Outsider, but it's still just as good quality in terms of service and how tasty the stuff all is.  I glanced at the food menu when I was here, although I didn't eat as I was just meeting friends for cocktails. And as far as places to meet for cocktails go, this place is a great shout. They're not cheap - in fact that would probably be my only quibble - but they're so well made you really won't mind, and they're still more reasonably-priced than the equivalent places on George Street.",

So, first trip here was with some other oh so lovely yelpers, as a little get together on my birthday. Did I have a totally awesome day? Yes!! Did going here help?? Fo' sho! We had a lovely little booth by the window. There was banter, there was chat, there was delicious cocktails. I had the berry flirtini, of course!? It was fruity and spot on!! I then had the Mistral Royale which just as tasty, but sadly about half the size! There was also munch, I plucked for some spicy potato wedges and Mussels which came in a vodka-y/vermouth-y broth. Both hit the spot, although I thought the broth from the mussels lacked flavour or a certain punch, which I had been expecting. Overall this visit was good!! Only down point being I did feel like they were maybe rushing us a little, I get it, we are sitting in at a food only table, but I certainly was not in any scramble to leave.  Second visit was specifically for the mulled cider I had seen advertised on the previous visit. My friend and I had spent the afternoon trampling down Princes Street 'trying' to get some Christmas shopping done. It was not a very productive afternoon, and the Saturday rush was beginning to get to my head, the only sensible solution - Mulled Cider. He utterly agreed, of course, who wouldn't!? So we headed to Villager. He was rather impressed by my choice....... and the cocktail menu. So we had some cider, it was perfect-o, warming, not too sweet with a lovely hint of orange. Then of course he wanted to try one of the cocktails, so I just had to have one too. He went for a cucumber-based concoction, which was not to my tastes, but he enjoyed it. I had some lethal tequila lovely yummy tasty thing. It was as good as my last experience of Villager cocktails. Only problem this time, lack of comfortable seating if you are just having a drink. I don't like sitting AT the bar, but other than that, very good.  I can very well see myself returning, the cocktails are just de-vine!!!",

Granted I have been fighting a cold for a few weeks that does not mean I am about to order cough syrup as a drink. Cough syrup that masqueraded as a Pear and Raspberry Mojito. Drink FAIL. When we informed our waiter of this she let me know that she had made the drink and we would still have to pay for it. Service FAIL. The food was fairly average and so I can't award extra point for it. The ambiance was rather plastic though the decor was well done. I have not tried the burgers but I'm willing to stake that I'll be returning to my old haunt rather than try this place again.",

Over weekends, it is usually jammed with polished professionals and twenty-somethings, often making it difficult if not impossible to find a seat. The cocktail menu is colourful and creative, offering any mix or concoction within the reaches of the imagination. Jugs of water infused with sliced melon or cucumber are constantly replenished on each table, adding a nice touch of quality.   The contemporary music and dimmed lightening create a relaxing ambience which is further enhanced by the chatty staff. All of this comes at a price so be prepared to dig deep in your pockets when having a night out at this sleek spot.",

With high ceilings and well though through decor and drinks choices, Villager is cosy without being crowded, and provides an ideal place to meet mates, or dare I say it take someone you are trying to impress on a first date. In fact, that's exactly how I'd define Villager, perfect first date territory  you can move to one of the quieter bits if things are going well, or rely on the hustle and bustle around you if conversation is running dry. My preferred option would be getting involved with the food, it is really good  definitely at the upper, more imaginative end of light bar food, although it is a little pricey.",

It is generally quite pricey. Definitely go for a laid-back late lunch, but if you want to have a good night out you have to take your chances.",

When we explained the situation, they told us the rest of us would have to stand as it would be unfair on other customers which we grudgingly did as they took our seats away. 10 minutes later, security tried to move us to a different part of the bar as we were standing in 'an eating area' leaving the disabled woman sitting on her own. We promptly left.   Whilst this sort of treatment is apparently common, its entirely unacceptable and I wont be back",

As other reviewers have mentioned it can be busy at night and the bar area can feel quite cramped, however if you ask nicely you can sit in the area where they serve food which has a couple of couches and boothes by the window. The best time to come is a Saturday or Sunday afternoon when it is much quieter. The cocktails are great and I love the water jugs which come with cucumber and mint or watermelon inside - a nice touch which makes a real difference. The food is upmarket pub grub and can be hit or miss - I recommend eating there in the afternoon as the quality can take a nosedive in the evening when it's busy. The menu is varied with curries and noodles alongside the burgers and chips. Although there are better places to eat nearby on George IV bridge this is the best bar. The Villager's sister bar, Dragonfly is also a great place for some cocktails.",

When we arrived there were loads of tables available and the friendly waitress brought us some of their famously tasty water with cucumber, watermelon and mint.  We all ordered drinks and they'd been advertising their \"cocktail of the week\" online, which I thought sounded pretty good.  The waitress didn't know what I was talking about and though the bar seemed to know, they ended up charging me more for it than was actually advertised.  Admittedly I didn't point this out because I was in a bit of a rush by then and it seemed petty to squabble over 60p, but I did find it an unfortunate oversight.    Two of us ordered their tasty cajun potato wedges and we agreed that we should have ordered one to share.  That didn't stop us from finishing both bowls, though.    My other friend ordered a burger which, when it first came out was undercooked to the extent that he had to go against his cardinal rule of never sending food back, and send it back.  The waitress was very nice about it and the kitchen recooked the burger and reported that some of the red colour came from the spices used.  This is fine and they handled it perfectly fine but it does seem odd that a place that makes burgers daily would actually churn one out that was SO undercooked.    So all in all a pretty \"meh\" experience.  Having said that, I would definitely return because as I said I felt that I'd caught the Villager on something of an off night.   It has an impressive cocktail list, nice staff, great location and good ambiance.  I look forward to trying a proper meal here and reporting back.",

    "text": "I first visted the Villager around 6 months ago and have been somewhat of a regular since. I was a little apprehensive at first as the place was rather quiet when we first went in, although it wasn't long after midday and once we were seated and wetting our thoroughly partched whistles the place got busier and ended up having a nice vibe.  We dropped in recently the day after the Edinburgh Art College fashion show before some of our pals headed back down the road to Glasgow. One thing that stood out here was how friendly the service was. Being the first people in a bar I sometimes feel that you disturb the staff from their daily routines of having a coffee, eating a bacon roll or completing the G2 crossword but the girl that served us couldn't have been happier to see a big group of us stagger, baggy-eyed through the door. Perhaps she thought we looked the type that would sit nurcing a pint and a burger while wiping the sleep from our eyes - and she was spot on.  Nevertheless the food was magic and just what the doctor ordered - well priced at 6.96 for a crackin burger and some quality beer on draft. I also noticed they have a Sunday Roast for around 9quid and you can also opt for a roast leg of lamb! I will be round at the weekend!",

Husband and I popped into Villager just before the kitchen closed, and even though the place was full to bursting, service was flawless.   First, the drinks. It's hard to make a choice from the extensive menu with a large selection of pretty unique concoctions. I chose the Banoffee Martini, which was practically a dessert. It's sweet, boozy, and absolutely delicious. I even liked the water they serve, which is flavored with watermelon, mint, and cucumber -- sorry, Villager, I'm totally stealing this recipe to serve at my next party :)   The food, while not earth shattering, is quite good and a welcome change from the more touristy offerings in the area. I'll admit to practically inhaling my entree -- chicken wrapped in bacon and stuffed with mozzarella. (I KNOW, RIGHT?! Yum.)   They had desserts, but who needs dessert when you have Banoffee Martinis? Not this girl, that's for sure.",

    "text": "Village burger! All the way!  Took my parents here a few nights ago when they were in town and we had a full on meal here. I was so surprised, I don't know why but I didn't expect the food to be *that* good. And boy was I wrong.  The burger was inspired. That's right, inspired. My dad's Sunday roast was a work of art and the fries were gone so fast (we're Dutch, we like fries) that I had but a fleeting impression of them, but oh man, crunchy, and delicous.  You know what I also like about this place, their water. Weird, yes, but they serve these jugs of water with fresh mint, watermelon and cucumber. What's so special about that? Two things: firstly, you get a tiny hint of all those flavours in your water which is just rather delicious really, and secondly, it means that the staff took the time to sit down and think about what it is the customer would want, and then they proceeded to execute it. It's thoughtful, like bringing flowers to a house-warming party. It makes you feel, welcome, and warm and fuzzy inside. (Possibly the cocktail had something to do with that as well, but hey).   Did I mention the service by the way? Fun, upbeat, engaged but never pushy.   Absolutely an Edinburgh favourite.",

    "text": "Sometimes you do judge a book by it's cover...  and in this case, it served me well!  I happened to be wandering around on a bitter cold day in Edinburgh, searching for some place to have a warm and filling lunch...  or just a pint to tie me over and get me out of the cold.  I was drawn in by the trendy, retro-esque decor...  but noticed they had a menu as well.  I noticed that it was buzzing, but the staff were very quick to get me seated.  I sat at one of the tables across from the bar, which looked wonderful and in reading the cocktails menu, I'm going to have to go back just to try one.  The waiter was quick to take a drink order, so I asked for a pint of a local ale, to which he gave me a choice, but I channeled my dad and said, \"Surprise me.\"  Whatever it was, it was very good.  In reading the menu, I discovered it was going to be very difficult to choose something as just about everything on the menu sounded absolutely delicious.  However, because it was cold and I was having a pint, I decided on the Pork and Chorizo Stew served with crusty bread.  The waiter came by a couple times before my order arrived to check on me, which I don't know that I have experienced a lot of that while here in Europe.  Some people might feel pestered, but it is nice to not have to wave someone down to get another pint.  The stew came out and it looked and smelled wonderful!  It was a large portion, but it looked like the right dish for a cold, winter day.  While I would've liked a little more chorizo, the stew was great!  The pork was tender and it was a little on the spicy side, but it was just the right amount and the pint helped soothe the heat.  And the crusty bread was a great touch to sop up any of the stew I may have missed with my spoon.  Loved it and hope to stop in again!",

And no doubt Scruffy Murphy's remembers me pretty well for various reasons, but we won't go into that, because it's completely irrelevant to this review.   The Villager is quite a quirky little number, with its retro print thing going on and its funky chilled out vibe and music to match. I think the idea here is to mellow out (did I actually just use that phrase?) and do your individual thing, and the visiting diners and drinkers are a mix of students, young professionals, or just anyone remotely trendy and a bit arty.   There are two sections to Villager, with a slim area beside the main bar and a larger space with sofas and tables for sinking into and bantering. The food is really decent, with a pretty all round people pleasing menu, and an equally pleasing selection of cocktails on the drinks list. There's a mix of DJs playing here every week, so musical genres can vary. All good chat though, which comes highly recommended.",

I met my brothers girlfriend for the first time in this restaurant. She is one of those annoyingly beautiful girls who always looks amazing and is really lovely. Tsuh. She chose the restaurant and so I knew it would be a good'un. As I said, it is really cool and the food is delicious! Really tasty and nice food, I was pleasantly surprised at the standard of the food. It is good food with a twist - I had a really yummy duck burger for lunch once, and I had a delicious Brie tarte for dinner during another visit. Their menu changes regularly so it's worth paying another visit. I look forward to it! It's the sort of place I would go to buy an entire new outfit for. Inc. jewelery.

Drinks are all I've had in here, and although not the cheapest, they are fair for the quality. A great place to take a date.",

    "text": "One of the first things to strike me was that the menu was not massive; there were a few starters, some mains, a couple of desserts and a selection of sides. Perfect, just enough to offer everyone a few choices, but not so much as to be overwhelming. One of my pet hates is restaurants that have ridiculously large menus; surely not everything can be fresh?   The food followed a sort of modern European theme - I went for the Chicken Caesar Salad and my friend had the Paella, we ordered some bread and oils too. Everything was well made and tasty, and represented good value for money.   However, it was the drinks that particularly impressed us. In stark comparison to the food menu, the drinks menu is huge. Clearly a lot of thought and imagination has gone into creating the lovely cocktails and devising new and exciting ways to have spirits and mixers. I started off with an espresso martini, which was perfect and a bargain at only 5.75, and followed it up with an Eldorado 5 year old rum with pineapple juice and ginger beer - this was dangerously tasty and refreshing, I could easily have drunk ten....  The Villager is a great bar and restaurant, it manages to retain a laidback ambience whilst keeping standards high in terms of food and drinks. This is definitely in my top ten places to eat and drink in Edinburgh.",

The design is a trendy blend of old meets new, retro wallpaper lit up by giant chandeliers. There's plenty of seating in this place, even a private room at the back but be warned, on a Friday and Saturday night it fills up very quickly.  The food in the Villager is pretty tasty, very light and fresh with a lean towards Asian fusion. I've never disappointed by the food here but I would say that the quality of the kitchen is not as high as the quality of the bar. Cocktails here are phenomenal. I have it on good authority that all the syrups and fruit blends are made in house- especially appealing! I would recommend the Villager to anyone looking for a classy spot of drinking. Well, maybe it will begin classy- who knows where it will end!",

I haven't eaten here so this review purely covers the drinking experience in The Villager. This is the place I went with friends and family post graduation and was great at meeting the wide ranging needs of everyone there. For the Dads they had Deuchars IPA on tap, for the Mothers they had a deal that runs Monday-Thursday for a bottle of  rose Prosecco for 10 and for the new graduates, well we wanted cocktails and cocktails we had! As well as the trusty staples of Cosmos, Mojitos and Martinis they also had new twists on the traditional and serve a lychee and rose martini or a pear raspberry mojito. I might be criticised for my stereotyping here but I can assure you, this did happen!  The cocktails range from 5.50 to 7.50.  Obviously we were all with parents who were glowing with pride and happy to foot the bill but if you are on more of a budget they have a section on the menu entitled 'Bored with vodka and coke'. This is the section that gives you more interesting combinations of drinks that would cost you the same as the standard spirit and mixer (around 3.50), my personal favourite is gin and sparkling elderflower juice. They say variety is the spice of life and this place is the place to at least spice up your drinks choices and feel a bit more upmarket drinking cocktails and tasty drinks in a nice setting.",

When you take a bite.... it bites back w the subtle and sudden tart of sour cream / lower sweet cream that hits your tongue 1st and then the chocolate rush trails right behind w intense pleasure.

The choice is huge and everyone will find something to suit them.  We came for dinner and luckily got a table for 2 on a busy Saturday night. We both had burgers, Mary the vegetarian one. To be honest, the food was not quite as good as I expected. The burger was bland, and the portion of fries was too small. It wasn't a bad meal, but nothing special for the price paid. However, some of the other food I saw people eat, including salmon, looked very tasty indeed. Maybe I need to return to try something else.  I had beer and Mary had wine with the meal. Both were nice. I enjoyed Sierra Nevada ale from the US- it was cold and refreshing. Service was fine, though it wasn't always easy to get attention. However, it was busy so that can be forgiven. Overall, a decent bar worth checking out.",

    "text": "This, somewhat accidentally, seems to have become our go-to place in Edinburgh when meeting friends. This is partly down the location, with George IV Bridge being central to most of our city adventures - but also because it's simply a good place to be.  It's predominantly a cocktail bar; or at least has always been marketed that way for as long as I have been going - sporadically over several years now. It's a big cocktail menu; each one made with care by an experienced and energetic staff - and I've not had a bad one yet. Real highlights include the Burntisland Iced Tea and the Lychee Rose Martini. I've had some other nice drinks from here; there's usually an interesting beer or two (at least in bottle form) and in the winter months I've been treated to warm, spiced cider.  They do now have a big focus on food; with the back area now sectioned off exclusively for those hoping to dine with their wine (or cocktails). I've only eaten a couple of times; but both times were fantastic. The first, I enjoyed a winter warmer of chorizo and chickpea stew, in a really delightfully rich sauce. The second was good old sausage and mash, but jazzed up a bit. No complaints there, everything is very tasty and leaves you wanting more. Even the tap water, brought in a jug full of mint and cucumber, is instantly refreshing and better than your standard bar fare. Great stuff!  The only downside is that it's a little small, especially now since the majority of space is reserved for eating. If you want to meet friends for drinks only, there aren't many tables and the long bar reduces standing room - and then of course the \"background\" music is often blasted out at a volume that means you can't hear your friends anymore. But that aside: if you come when it's a little quieter: the staff, food, and drinks will make you want to return. Brilliant!",

It is full of happy memories for us and the staff are always welcoming and totally makes you feel relaxed and at home.  As we hadn't booked a table, the waitress offered us one of the sofas which was perfect for a girly catch up with a bottle of wine and a mezze sharing plate.  All in all a great evening and I struggle to find negatives about the Villager. Oh apart from the toilets, they are in DESPERATE need of a refurb!",

When I mentioned that the drinks were awful, they did nothing and said if we wanted another drink we would have to pay for it.  It's absolutely okay if the bartender doesn't know the recipe, but be honest with the customer.",

    "text": "I remembered Villager from the last time we were in Edinburgh about two years ago, and the amazing Banoffee Martini's that they had!  So I was pleased to see that whilst wondering around looking for a bar, Villager was still here and still making Banoffee Martini's. We came here after dinner but they do serve food, and it looks very nice, next time maybe I'd give it a try.   The Villager has lovely staff and given my problem with decision making and staring at the cocktail menu for quite some time the barman offered just to make me whatever I usually drink, which bought me some time to have a proper look at the cocktail menu whilst drinking that one. After much consideration I stuck to my Banoffee Martini, it's just so tasty!  It's very chilled here and they have a nice atmosphere of which I could(and did) spend hours in. In fact we even came back the next night for more drinks!",

    "text": "To me, the Villager feels like a regular bar that thinks it's really cool, except it isn't. The staff have a bit of a wannabe hipster vibe. The food is standard gastro-pub fare and does the job without too much problem. The last time I had food I had a burger, which was a bit dry and just alright.  The staff were pretty snobby on my most recent visit; they came over as proper draconian on the whole \"you will definitely have to move from this seat because someone might want food at some point in the near future even though this table isn't booked\". Five women drinking cocktails over the course of two hours is apparently not a priority for the bar, despite the likely higher bill for 8 per drink. We got hassled quite a few times about where we were sitting and it was irritating to feel that as paying customers we weren't as important as people eating.  On the plus side, the location is excellent and it's often chosen as an inoffensive place to meet up with friends for catch ups. Don't expect anything exciting - its hipster vibe feels a bit tired and obvious.",

    "text": "We came to the Villager thinking it was an upscale pub, but it's really more of a cocktail bar/lounge. For dinner, we were seated on sofas around a low table, which would have been comfortable for drinks but was a bit awkward for a meal. I tried one of their many cocktails, a play on an old-fashioned with smoky Scotch.   The food was fine, albeit a little expensive for something simple like the vegetarian platter, with good fish and chips. We had better pub food in Edinburgh, but it was certainly nothing to complain about.   The real problem was the service, which was sporadic and inattentive. I think we came in during a shift change, because our original waitress disappeared and was replaced after a period of time by another waiter. When we tried to pay, the credit card reader couldn't read our cards - another frustration! Overall, it was a fine meal but I'd say this is a better spot for cocktails and snacks than dinner.",

    "text": "A little nicer than your average beer and a burger I'm coming around to The Villager.   I've frequented this place and am usually swayed to stay by the bar and the music. I heartily recommend the mojitos. Last week I went for food for the first time and I was a happy Sara.  The water was gereat, cucumber, watermelon and mint made it deliciously refreshing! I had the mussels with bacon, tomato and pine nuts served with some delicious bread, and a blue cheese and walnut salad. Everything was cooked perfectly and the tomatoey baconey sauce was absolutely delicious. Yum. I was so happy with the food I just had to attempt dessert which was served in the form of a coconut and passion fruit panna cotta. The panna cotta was a little on the very sweet side. I was expecting flavour in the the actual panna cotta but it came with a slaver of sauce that was just too sickly for me.  Across from me a cauliflower and tallegio risotto was scoffed in roughly twenty seconds, so I'd say watch it if you expect larger portions (though maybe my OH just needs a smaller spoon ?!) And beside me the vegetable burger with chips received a glowing report.  Yes I was the only one who got dessert. Don't judge me!  The staff were lovely although a bit slow, even though there weren't many people in we did have to chase them down a few times. The layout is very swish, the bare walls with graffitti-esque paintings and cool light fixtures are pretty impressive.  For me this will be a Sunday lunch when I'm feeling fancier than usual.",

Cool cocktails but keep your sister away from the Berry Flirtinis or she might get thrown out of a taxi for being too drunk.   Cool food also, modern pub stuff, nothing too extravagant and well-priced. The music is pretty good also. Popular among the after work crowd but also a very busy late night spot.",

It's been a while since I've been, but I'm glad to say the food is still as good as I remember and the cocktail list is still fun and really has something to please everyone.  We'd only booked for 5, so were given a booth by the front door.. but we ended up being 7, and they were very accommodating and let us move into the dining room so we could sit along the back on the bench seating..   The only reason I've not given 5 stars was because the service got a bit sporadic nearer the end of our evening. Not to say it was bad at any stage and the girl managed to remember a massive ad hoc order we threw at her without writing anything down, so kudos!  All in all, a great night was had by all and I wouldn't hesitate to go back and take company with me!",

    "text": "As my hangover attests, Villagers is fast becoming one of my favourite bars.   A discreet neighbourhood joint in the charming Old Town, it's a stone's throw from the Missoni Hotel and directly opposite my favourite Edinburgh restaurant.* In the daytime, it's usually filled with graduates and groups of girls catching up over burgers and bottles of wine whilst in the evening, it's gently bustling with locals having a cheeky drink on their way home.   Decor and ambience wise, Villager falls somewhere between Shoreditch and Williamsburg. There's high ceilings, dusty chandeliers, low-slung leather sofas and lots of urban art stencilled directly onto exposed brick and concrete walls. The vibe is relaxed, the staff are cute and tattooed and the fact it's Edinburgh not the East End, means there's an absence of egotistical hipsters in skinny jeans and big sunglasses. Best of all, Villager serves everything from Mojitos to Guinness and the music ranges from Miles Davis and Curtis Mayfield to Joy Division.   * (Patience is a virtue.... If you can't wait to read my next review, my favourite restaurant shares the same name as an Albert Camus novel.)",

    "text": "My cousins and I stopped in here on our first evening in Edinburgh after reading the good Yelp reviews. We were looking for something with healthier food, good wine, and a fun atmosphere and Villager delivered on all accounts. We were shown to a cozy booth and had an excellent (and very cute) server who took great care of us. I love how they serve the water here-in pitchers infused with fruit and herbs, very tasty and refreshing. I thought I ordered the smoked chicken salad but our server heard that I ordered just the straight smoked chicken, and I am so glad he made that mistake! The chicken was amazing and served with perfectly roasted root vegetables, the entire dish was filling without being too hearty. It looked like there were a fair amount of locals at the Villager as well, and it didn't feel touristy, which was a nice change from the restaurants on High Street.",
