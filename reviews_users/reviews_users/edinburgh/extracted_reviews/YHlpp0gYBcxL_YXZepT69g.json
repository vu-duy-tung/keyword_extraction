There was a reserved table for 15 of us and it was pretty quiet in the bar other than us so I was amazed how long it took to get our drinks order, at least 20 minutes if not more. I'm just glad that the gin and tonic with coriander was worth the wait.   The place was nice and clean and I watched the other bar staff dusting and keeping busy which is nice to see.",

    "text": "Not my usual style of haunt for a Saturday night, however plan A was rammed and was a friends call on location.   First the venue itself, nice interior (love some of the interesting lighting), not bad atmosphere, tho pick your seating location with care, especially if there during the winter, heating in one place and aircon in another! Have to admit the venue itself is what brings this up to a 2*.  Wasn't as busy as had expected considering it was the weekend, yet table service was shocking, ignored by staff even when waved at, and when did finally come over seemed confused/inexperienced when placing an order for a single simple item on the menu, the nachos.  Food arrived in reasonable time, however I think the kitchen needs to be shown what a nacho is, huge, puffed up deep fried things rather than what I'd call nachos. To their credit when they did miss an item off the plate it was fixed immediately.   Drink selection, usual mainstream chain pickings, focused on the expensive wine end of the spectrum, which I expected, but would be nice to have at least a standard ale to hand. Next time when its my turn to pick it'll be red squirrel, the beer kitchen or hanging bat over the road when it comes to beer.   Finally the price, got what I expected, 2.50 for a 'from the carton' fruit juice, and same for a half a standard larger.   In summary, starting the night before a show or 'night on the town' sure this would suffice, meeting a friend for a catchup over a drink, best look elsewhere.",

I've not tried the food though so will have to do that.   Not much to say but I will be back here.",

I'm not difficult to please when it comes to beer and a burger and I'm fairly positive about the George street branch, though I've never eaten there, but I probably won't be going back to this place if I can help it.  It's not *so* expensive (9.50 for a burger) but for what you get I wouldn't pay it again. We were hassled by the waiting staff quite a bit, which I wasn't fond of, particularly as we had made it clear we just wanted food and not to be bothered.  We just ate and left, there's no atmosphere in the place and the staff are overly attentive yet distant and cold.   A definite 'meh' from me. Especially with The Red Squirrel just over the road, it's just not worth your time or money.",

    "text": "It's True, this is part of a chain and so it's not exactly oozing character by the bucketload. But there's one thing that sticks out in my memory about the time I came here for lunch...  When I first came here to go to uni 4 years ago, anyone and everyone shared all their little pearls of wisdom with me. All except for the one that says, \"don't go out on the lash the night before your parents are coming up and you have to spend the day with them\". This, I learned the hard way when my Dad was speaking at some meeting at the nearby International Conference Centre, and whilst he was doing that my hangover and I went for lunch with my mum.  Walking into this branch of All Bar One and clocking all the bottles and beer taps behind the bar was the last thing I needed, and my hangover suddenly got ten times worse. Anyway, to get back to my review, although the place was soul-less and totally overpriced, the waiter was an absolute lifesaver in the way that he kept bringing me pint after pint of iced water. For that reason alone, I will give this place three stars. Although I was too busy concentrating on trying to make the room stop spinning to notice whether or not it was the winking waiter mentioned by Stuart, I can safely guess on the basis of how rough I was looking that it wasn't!",

    "text": "I hesitate to give any All Bar One a four star review because, prior to last week, I felt that the chain was irredeemable.   But then, prior to last week, I had only visited the ABO on George St and grew very tired very quickly of stuck up wait service with mediocre food.  Well, I can't comment on this ABO's food, but I am very happy to report that, based on the other reviews,  these guys appear to have cleaned up their act (or at least, I got a good night).    On a dark and stormy JUNE evening, ABO was the closest bar to where I'd been working that day, and a few of us were definitely in need of a drink.  Having heard so many dire reports about this place I figured I would appreciate it for the beer I would have and my appreciation would end there.  So, I was very pleasantly surprised to discover that a) this place is well furnished and has a corporate, yet clean and friendly vibe to it, and b) there were tables for my group to sit and rest our weary legs.     The bartenders were friendly and efficient, and the selection of beers on tap was pretty decent.  Nothing too unusual, but definitely more than the standard Tennants/Deuchars fare.    As I said, I can't comment on the quality of the food but the menu looked nice and the waiter who helped my colleagues order (and based on what they were ordering, gave them a deal), was very helpful and friendly.  I wouldn't expect to be blown away by the food here but at the end of the day you don't really come here expecting a culinary masterpiece, just something tasty and maybe a bit stodgy to line your belly and allow for one or two extra pints.  So, all in all a much more positive experience than I was expecting and certainly one I wouldn't mind repeating.",
