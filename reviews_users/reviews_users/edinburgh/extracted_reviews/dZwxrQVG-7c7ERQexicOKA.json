I tried the fish and chips on nearly every stop we made including in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Luss, and Dublin, and Benes was BY FAR the absolute best Fish and Chips I had anywhere! The fish is perfectly seasoned and breaded, and the chips are perfectly cooked. Everywhere else I had them they were a bit greasy or crunchy but not at Benes! Here they were perfection. We found this place because our flight arrived very late and nothing else was open. I'm so glad we tried out this little takeaway! It was perfect!",

And Bene is a funny guy, just ask him!  I came here twice because, the first time I was intent on fish and chips, they convinced me to try the haggis.  The first and so far only time I've had haggis. And I honestly (no offense) never thought I'd try haggis.  It wasn't bad!  So I went back the next night for fish and chips.  But be warned, order the fish and chips and be without company, ye shall suffer a horrible fate - wasted good food.  Ay, on top of a healthy bunch of chips you get a small whale or a massive chunk of fish.  Best bring a friend or 2.",

Finally a place that knows how to cook chips without making them oily. Big portion that is almost enough for two. Get them with salt, vinegar and brown sauce. Oh and no matter how full you are, come back for the deep fried mars bar. Insanely good but should be eaten warm so don't order it with your food. One thing though, this place is take out only. If it's a sunny warm day, no problem. A park bench will do fine. If it's raining, you'll have to take it back to your hotel or figure something out. I stood in an archway eating mine during the rain with a Huge smile on my face. Completely worth it. Rain or shine, I definitely wouldn't go to Edinburgh without eating here again.",

More importantly though I keep coming back because the chips - in my view the real measure of a chippie - are really good.  The chips I had last night - a large portion, which I shared were a lovely mix of sizes and all very well done, some crispy some soggy, none undercooked. For their location they aren't expensive, they seem to be open late and the staff are friendly.   Also noticed this time some newspaper clippings on the wall detailing the royal clientele who make use of Bene's proximity to the Palace. So if you are a staunch republican you may have to steer clear, but I wouldn't let your politics get in the way of a good late night snack.",

I always judge a chippy on the quality of it's more exotic options such as the king rib, chipsteak or chicken, and having only tried the fish I can't be certain how good these delights are, but the haddock supper I went for was more than satisfactory.  Big, crunchy and tasty, the fish gets no complaints from me. Not unforgettable, but a bit above the average.",

I really did! I would go to Castle Rock and Franco's and it was great and I was happy. But tonight, well, I thought I'd try Benes because it sounded like it might be better.  And holy crap. You know how sometimes you want to cry because a dog is so smol? Benes is like that but with food.  Almost every component was orders of magnitude better than I'd had before (I tried the doner kebab, mushy peas, fried pizza, and fish & chips). The only bit that was merely good were the chips, and bear in mind I got delivery so the chips even being passable yet alone good is some kind of crazy near-Christmas miracle.  I sound crazily enthusiastic. Cultish. It's that good.  Update: Okay it's two hours later and I just remembered that I had a load of laundry. Benes is so good I forgot I have laundry to hang and it might be moldy and it's so worth it.",

One item that's not listed on their menu, although it really ought to be, is the deep-fried Mars bar. According to MyFitnessPal, this tiny snack will tax your body a whopping 600 calories!

We chose a bench across the street.   Bene's really spoiled me for fish and chips. An entire fillet of fresh haddock is fried to order and then served volcanic hot over thick chips. There's no seasoning on anything by default, so don't hesitate to ask them to pile on the salt, malt vinegar, brown sauce, etc. before boxing it up. The fillet size is gigantic- so big that it is longer than its styrofoam container. This makes it slightly less portable. Thankfully there are benches across the street for eating it up like a bunch of fools.   I wouldn't have a good comparison for Benes until I grabbed a late night after-bar snack at Clamshell. Just gross and old fish immediately noticeable with Bene's as the gold standard.",

I missed the driver by a few minutes (the restaurant is 3 minutes away) and when I did manage to get through to the restaurant, the man who answered the phone immediately began to have a go at me, refused to bring the order back out, told me he wouldn't refund me and kept cutting me off when I tried to explain the situation. When he finally did let me talk, he agreed to refund me; however, I've been in customer service myself. The situation, while annoying, happens and the person who handled the call handled it in a really unprofessional manner.  In the end I did end up getting my order from a different place which delivered within 10 minutes of ordering, while Bene's took 1 hour.",

    "text": "Thank goodness for Benes.  It's around 10 pm or so on September 5th, we've just settled into our rented flat, we're starving, and we're exhausted, having been through 5 airports in 28 hours.  We stumble from our flat to the very first place we find (that is still open), which is Benes.  It is small, brightly lit, and smells like something fried but delicious.  Inside looks like a small chip shop with some talent show playing on the TV.  We order a kebab, a side of chips & cheese, and fish & chips.  They're getting a lot of good press on the fish & chips, and I'll be honest - I didn't try the fish.  The kebab was pretty excellent (as an American, it resembled more of a gyro), with several different kinds of meat and an array of sauces on the side!  Yum!  The side of chips was way more than I could eat, and the cheese was super thick - needed salt, but otherwise pretty good.  It inspired me to want to try their chips & gravy, and I wish I had!  My tip for tourists is this: I know that the dine-in restaurants are appealing, and I know that you feel like you've got to have fish & chips in this neck of the woods.  Once you get that out of your system, spread your wings in Edinburgh's other takeaway places.  They're pretty darn good!  AND, not just for fish & chips!  I recommend Benes.  And I recommend the kebab, and getting adventurous with your chips.",

Fish was fresh, batter tasty.  I'd have given 5 stars but they have odd hours (not open for lunch)  and there is no seating(which is not uncommon in Edinburgh.) there are benches in front of the Kirk.  Three of us shared a fried Mars bar. Never heard of such a thing. Wow.",

An entire half of a large fish filleted, battered, and fried. I prefer my fish with a cleaner taste, I guess. There's nowhere to sit, you splash on some brown sauce and hop on the bench across the street on a sunny day. If they provided a bar of interesting toppings, like perhaps a mango chutney or pico de gallo or a special tartare sauce, it would be much more interesting.",

Of course, I chose the fish and chips- what else?! The fish was fresh and tasted excellent, the chips were abundant and delicious. I was very happy with the food.  Value is good too, so what more can you ask from a fish and chips place? Will be back.  Aside: some Royals have eaten here in the past. Can't remember the exact reason why, but it's well explained on the walls of Bene's. :)",

This is a take away place with fresh and tasty food. I had the spaghetti with spicy sauce and it was delicious. Hubby had the fish and chips and it was cooked to perfection. Garlic bread was also tasty. All in all we highly recommend Bene's for great late night food and friendly service. Always a smile when we came into the shop.",

My friend assured me that this place does the best chicken so ordered a half chicken supper. Whenever I have done this in the past I am disappointed as the chicken is quite dry and chewy. I was honestly so impressed by the chicken at Benes. I don't know how they do it but their chicken is so good. I ate every single bit of it and left behind just the bones. My friend ordered a sausage supper and we were surprised that it came with 2 sausages. She was really pleased with this. I did initially think that Benes charges more than other places but the food was delicious and you got your moneys worth. However unfortunately I am rarely in Edinburgh but now I know there is a chippy out there which does good chicken.",
