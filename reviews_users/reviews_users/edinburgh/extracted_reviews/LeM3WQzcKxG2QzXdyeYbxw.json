Fabulous Italian, reasonable and friendly staff  We flew in yesterday and were given a \"bum steer\" but tonight we dined here and loved it Order the focaccia - amazing - crisp light and flavorful  The pasta- al dente- perfect. Sauces - light and blended with the pasta perfectly   Did I mention reasonably priced?  Go- now!",

    "text": "I very good, but often over-looked restaurant. My husband and I ate dinner here twice during our stay in Edinburgh. We also ate at more popular, expensive places. The restaurant is mid-size, comfortable and not particularly fancy. But on both visits, our meals were excellent. My husband had pizza in one visit and a seafood pasta the other. I had pasta carbonara and, on the second visit, pasta with smoked ham and a Gorgonzola sauce. We also split bruschetta appetizers. Everything was delicious and very reasonably priced. Recommended.",

    "text": "Gali's is a reasonably solid Italian place that's in desperate need of a spruce-up, both in terms of the decor and the menu. It wouldn't take much to drag this place from mid-table mediocrity, though, as their fundamentals are very good.  Overall, we said: \"Gali's was a muddle of good and bad. In the final analysis, things can be summed up in one phrase: the place needs a refresh. They need to redecorate, and focus more on the excellent dining space they have. Stripping back the outdated \"modernisations\" would be a good place to start. But mostly, they need to re-energise the kitchen, as for now they are an object lesson in a good \"red sauce\" being not quite enough to sustain an entire menu.\"",

    "text": "We booked a table at Gali's for a bite to eat before the Scotland/England rugby game, so needless to say the place was heaving. The staff coped really well with the number of covers they had to deal with and the food was.OK. It's not the best looking of places and the food doesn't look too enticing wither when it arrives but it tastes good. I did end up with a wine glass full of floaters and a hair in it though, I hadn't noticed til I was futher down the glass or I'd have sent it back. Good atmosphere, nice staff, just a bit dated and perhaps not the nicest of settings.",
