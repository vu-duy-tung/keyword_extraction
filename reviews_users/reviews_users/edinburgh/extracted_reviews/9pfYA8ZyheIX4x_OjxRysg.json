    "text": "Edinburgh Food Studio is run by Ben and Shashana and is a fab addition to the Southside. I first came across Ben about 3 years ago when he was home for the holidays and doing a talk on food at Iglu - grasshopper soy sauce and bee larvae granola anyone? For the record, both were super tasty! Ben previously worked at Nordic Food Lab and following this, at the studio, unusual and traditional ingredients are presented in new ways with an open kitchen so diners can see the dishes in progress and large communal tables.  I came for dinner last week as Roddie Loan who supplies seafood to michelin starred Noma was here. Roddie left Norway at 3am on Thursday morning with clams, sea urchins and seaweeds, plus aqua vite to cook for lucky Edinburgh punters who managed to get booked in for his Arctic Feast.   What a feast it was! I'd never had sea urchins before and the inner five year old was mesmerised watching them still move, even after we'd eaten the insides. They were lovely and sweet. We followed this with clams and mussels - fab. Then came clam tartare and my gluten free version came with buckwheat and beautifully earthy scarlet capped mushrooms. Cod with beautiful buttery mash followed and then dessert was an Norwegian rice pudding with cinnamon and butter. Sounds weird but was lovely. I didn't get cheese and instead had a sea buckthorn sorbet which was both savoury and sweet. Throughout, Roddie and Ben talked us through the dishes, telling stories and providing a really great night. The communal dining experience won't work for everyone but I love it - trying new things with fellow co-conspirators really adds to the atmosphere.",

A bit out of the main part of town, it's a short taxi/uber ride for some wonderful food, wine, beer and fun.  I highly recommend you try this wonderful treasure.  I wish the owners achieve their dreams.",

    "text": "A small restaurant with a warm atmosphere, friendly and cohesive staff, and artistic ambiance.  While a bit pricey, the food was totally worth it.  It's a set menu, so they just bring you food and at the end I was full, but not uncomfortably so. The flavor combinations were exquisite and I treasured every bite.  Great presentation as well - I could tell they valued their food on each plate that left the kitchen.",

    "text": "Edinburgh food studio is my favourite restaurant ever, and that is not a statement I make lightly. It is non-pretentious, friendly, and can make dishes that are almost perfect (I had a halibut with dulce seaweed tonight that filled my heart with genuine happiness).  They have a network of some of the best chefs in the world, and they bring them to town to play, serving dinners at a ridiculous value. Keep an eye on their website for events, and just go!",
