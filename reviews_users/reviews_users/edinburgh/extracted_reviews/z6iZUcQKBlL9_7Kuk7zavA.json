    "text": "I was surprised to see that this taeaway is actually a fish bar.  There is nothing on the front of Montgomery or even in its menu to suggest that it specialises in fish.  I thought it was a pizzeria more than anything after I visited it.  The menu has the usual selection of deep fried fish, sausages and haggis with chips as well as a wide selection of pizzas and calzones.  I opted for the pepperoni and sweetcorn pizza which was well cooked and the ingredients tasted pretty fresh.  It was also reasonably priced considering it only cost 4 along with a can of coke.   Although nothing particularly special, Montgomery Fish Bar has fast, effective service and is worth a visit if you're in the area and looking for a cheap takeaway.",
