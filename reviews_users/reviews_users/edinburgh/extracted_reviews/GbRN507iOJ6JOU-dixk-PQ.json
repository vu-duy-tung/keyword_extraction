    "text": "Visited based on previous reviews, for a spot of brunch with my girlfriend. It was busy but there where tables free, however the host seemed nervous about seating us and after some time said he could 'sneak us in under radar' as there was some reservations made, he didn't seem particularly warm and welcoming and we felt like we where an inconvenience to be frank. Food was decent and well priced, I had the French toast and my other half had the veggie breakfast. Coffee was solid, although I asked for a cappuccino and got what looked and tasted like a latte,  my girlfriend got a hot chocolate which was cold. Overall the food was decent, service wasn't great, the saving grace was it wasn't that expensive.",

The teabag was a standard Twinings and I'm not sure if the tray bake was home-made or not, but it was also, you know, fine.   The other half ordered a muffin and smoothie, but when the muffin arrived it looked a bit small and sad.   As I didn't order any of the famed breakfast food, maybe a repeat visit would up my star ranking. But I probably wouldn't make an effort to come back here as it's not my side of town so the breakfast may have to wait. However, it's a nice enough stop and the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, so a definite bonus for the customer service.",

They have ample seating in the front and back room. It may get busy, but to ensure a table you can also reserve your table.   I like that they encourage you to have a playful time with the amount of games on offer. Trivial Pursuit anyone? Or Ludo?    I am also very pleased that they are willing to take on 'experimental' personal orders. I had the Waffles with (crispy!) Bacon & Maple Syrup  and added fresh banana and strawberries. (trust me that combination is awesome!)   In addition I ordered a Bloody Mary and that was brilliantly spiced and served with all the required condiments.   The prices are reasonable and I have now found my go to place for weekend scrumptions! - This is easily a place where you can take your friend, mum, family and sports team for hearty or sweet 'pick me up' or play some games.   I. Like. A. Lot.",

I'd been to this place in a previous incarnation and liked its intimacy and high standards of food, but with the Blue Bear makeover I'd say these qualities have been taken on a level. This isn't a big place, but there's plenty going on and the staff are clearly keen to make every party or couple or group or loner equally loved and cared for. Everyone in my party enjoyed their food too, which arrived hot and in good time.  I'm intrigued by the back garden - presumably shared between numerous properties in the Edinburgh style. There's a fairly large trampoline out there, lying askew on a 20-30 degree grass slope: that's not going to end well. As a diner I wasn't given the chance to witness anyone testing it out though. Maybe next time.",

    "text": "Thanks Jenny L for reminding me I need to update my review after the Yelp night we had here.  I do really like the Blue Bear - it'd be even better with gluten free pancakes that they gave us on the Yelp night but they won't do them - though I keep trying to change this when I visit :-)  The omelet is pretty decent and they do gluten free bread for toast which is a winner for me but I'm not a huge egg fan (I know I like omelette's but not eggs boiled, fried, poached, scrambled, etc) so the menu can create a few issues for me. Heaven for me would be gluten free pancakes/potato scones but not seen anywhere that offers a big breakfast that is able to do this, though I know other yelpers rate the big breakfast here highly.  Staff are friendly and at pains to make sure you are having a great time which is lovely to see as some places the food can be great but the service less so. Last time we were asked 5 times though which was a bit much.   The Blue Bear isn't exactly local for me but in good brunch terms, nowhere is so I'm happy to make the trek to Cannonmills for an omelet brunch :-)",

Then out comes the French toast with huge slices of bacon on top, the eggs florentine, the big bear breakfast stack, and you and your frowns exchange looks that make it clear that this is going to be a family style meal. And as you taste all of the flavours, and savor the sweet and savory combination you have exposed your tongue to, you know that you will crave this for days, possibly forever.  So, yeah, I live nearby. I have enough self control to only casually walk by and decide \"by chance\" to eat here about once a week. But if my body could handle the mass amounts of food I find a way to consume here, I'd come more often.",

We knew right away that this was where we wanted to eat. 1) they were still serving breakfast and we're late risers and 2) the inside/decor was really welcoming. The staff was super-friendly and more than helpful with our questions about the menu and other items we weren't used too (being from another country). My girlfriend ordered the Veggie Bear, and proclaimed it the best breakfast she's ever had.  I went for the breakfast staples, and they were also excellent. I really wish there was a place like this in my neighborhood - it's worth the trip back to Edinburgh just for the Blue Bear!",

    "text": "i am shocked that i seem to have not yet reviewed this lovely place!!  i'm actually rather disappointed with myself as The Blue Bear is a fantastic wee brunch place that serves brunch all day!  in fact it specialises in all things good about breakfast: waffles, pancakes, full breakfasts, omlettes, and eggs benedict!  they also have some amazing brunch cocktails, the breakfast martini is delicious :)  i've sadly only been here twice, once for an AMAZING elite event where the friendly owners seemed to bring a never ending supply of delicious breakfast foods out to us.  and very kindly for me they mixed up a special bowl of fruit and yogurt since i was celebrating passover and couldn't eat bread.  i swore to myself i'd be back here as soon as i could have bread again but then months passed before i got a chance to go.  luckily ms kelly f suggested brunch here a few weeks back and i was in!  i was also late in meeting kelly which the owner joked about as she was waiting for ten minutes.  but that's the sort of place this is, where the owners are friendly and genuinely happy to see you and chat about life or make a joke to keep their customers smiling.  it gives such a great vibe to the restaurant and makes it a real pleasure to go.  then there is also the food!  the menu is all brunch all the time, love it!!  i had the full veggie when i went and throughly enjoyed it.  fluffy scrambled eggs, roasted cherry tomatoes, veggie sausages, potato scone, toast, and beans.  a massive portion for a small price.  i think it was only about 8 including my pot of tea!  brilliant value for such tasty food.  just writing this review is already convincing me that i need to go back soon!!  next time it's the eggs florentine i'm after!!",

Loved the choice for  all day breakfast, as was able to choose it without a few items I dislike, beans/tomatoes, but including the essential  mushrooms, Black Pudding and Haggis. You also get to choose how you would like your eggs done, scrambled, fried,etc. Sauces were brought to the table, by the bottle. no awkward sachets.  Tea was served in a small china cup and saucer, which I wasn't keen on, but it did come in a proper colourful china teapot, and on asking they do also serve it in a mug if preferred, so I will know to ask for that next time.   Tea was served with a cute little miniature milk bottle, which made me think of Alice in Wonderland, \"drink me\", I loved that quirky touch. The salt and pepper shakers were also bright and colourful, all very plesaant compared to supermarket cafes with their beige cups ans stainless steel or plastic condiments.  The coffee and walnut cake was delicious, but I was surprised to see all cakes and biscuits were displayed on open plates on counter, no covers. I would have preferred them to be in see through covers for hygiene reasons, especially when summer arrives.  Could not fault the staff for friendliness though, and I will be back.",

But these guys serve brekkie all day, so I rocked up at lunch time and was rewarded with a near-perfect rendition of my favorite: eggs florentine. Perfectly poached eggs and cooked spinach, if I was being picky I'd just say the hollandaise sauce could have done with a bit more bite. But it was so good I stuck about for some lunch, partaking of their veggie sharing platter (if cut down in size for my personal enjoyment).   I'm a bit fussy with my coffee but there's no problem here, and my two Americanos were lovely and strong, just how I like them.

    "text": "I can't begin to tell you how disappointed I was that I missed both the Elite event and the Sunday Brunch Club here. I'm a massive fan of brunch and I'm always on the lookout for somewhere new to try to see if they beat Toast in Marchmont (current reigning champion for the best brunch in Edinburgh.)   Thankfully I've now been to the Blue Bear a few times and it really is a fantastic restaurant for brunch. The food is phenomenal and generously portioned. The first time I went for brunch and had the 'Big Bear', their equivalent of a full breakfast, I couldn't finish it all. This was problematic for me as the food tasted so good that I didn't want to stop eating despite starting to make myself feel sick from being overfull. The Big Bear also comes with tea/coffee AND juice which is generous but way too much for me which leads to feelings of guilt that I can't finish my juice.   I've also had the waffles here which are also a popular choice. It's disappointing that they don't have pancakes on the menu (or not that I've seen) as I'm much more partial to a pancake than a waffle. They are however very flexible in changing things on the menu. The last time I came here for food I had brought my eight year old (and very fussy eater) niece with me. She wanted waffles, but not a full portion, maple syrup and bananas please. Our waiter was kind enough to charge us a half portion of waffles and sort out the bananas for us. (They weren't on the menu at all.) Having a server who understands the pickiness of kids is amazing and makes a trip out with a little 'un less anxiety inducing as you worry what you can get them to eat.   The staff here are amazingly friendly and welcoming which makes coming back a real pleasure. I'm not sure it's nicked the top spot of Best Brunch in Edinburgh yet but it's certainly working on it and that means I'm definitely going to have keep going back until I can make up my mind.",

The food was very good and the tea was served at a perfect temperature, not too hot, ready for a sip. The place is posh and looks cool.

    "text": "Lured in by a Yelp brunch, I had heard great things from people who had been before.  The rest of my party were all delighted but I was not...  The menu was somewhat short on gluten-free options but being a Sunday morning I thought to opt for a modified breakfast. I asked if I could have an adaptation that missed out any glutenous items - haggis, black pudding, potato scones, toast, and possibly the sausages. I was told, after checking with the kitchen, that the sausages were indeed unsafe and that they had run out of gluten free bread so there was no toast. Fine, just give me a plate full of whatever is safe!  My double macchiato was delivered - more like a very small latte, full to the brim so it ended up spilling - and in time breakfast appeared, with the black pudding, sausage and potato scones on the plate. I queried this and it was taken away, returning without the offending items. I was quite happy to have bacon, scrambled eggs, tomatoes, mushrooms and beans, and these were all quite lovely. As this left the plate rather more bare than it might have been I assumed that I would be charged less. But no.   The place is nice, the service was friendly and the food is tasty. But if you're needing anything different it might not be ideal.",

It's not massive inside so at busy brunchy times you really want to book otherwise you'll be one of the fools stood at the window drooling over the French toast with bacon ;)  I had my daughter with me who was in a little mood shall we say so I can't give this place a thorough review but from what I had experienced this is a lovely place. They have high chairs but not massive swathes of space to put them which can be a little stressy if it's super busy like the day I went in.  Breakfast/brunch seems to be their specialty. The menu has plenty of choice so you definitely shouldn't have a problem choosing something you like.  The French toast and bacon with maple I ordered was nice but I'm unable to give it 5 out of 5 because I was eating it cold out of a box in the car (cute lil daughter couldn't get through the whole brunch affair).  Everyone else (locals) at my table loved the food they were served so that's why I'm giving it a four. It's definitely worth squeezing your butt into a seat here.",

The staff are awesome, the coffee is strong and the food is consistently brilliant. Nothing particularly fancy - eggs benedict is a favourite, alongside waffles and a good range of pastries - but always done absolutely perfectly and for a good price. It's also child-friendly, dog-friendly and has a counter stacked with board games. What more could you ask for?  The only downsides are a direct result of the Blue Bear's awesomeness. If it's a miserable rainy morning, its tricky to get a table because half of north Edinburgh gets the same idea. For the same reason, arrive too late and the popular items are likely of be off the menu (I take a finite supply of ingredients to be a good sign in itself).  Top notch.",

French toast with creme fraiche and berries was on the menu for me today and it went down a treat.  Perfect size and a nice amount of berries - lip smacking good.  I didn't order a drink today, but could smell the Illy coffee, which I am told was quite strong and definitely does the trick, so good to know if I am ever in need of a caffeine hit.  And the omelette opposite me looked amazing, so that will be the next dish I try.    Last time I was here for another work lunch, I had the soup and sandwich combo.  It was tasty, but nothing amazing and my soup was lukewarm. However, I still enjoyed it and today's brunch totally made up for it.  I was also eyeing up the sweet treats at the counter today - scones, croissants, flapjacks, tiffin, apple loaf, banana loaf etc.  So also a great destination for coffee and cake as well as brunch or lunch.  Friendly service as always from Ben, Jemma and co.  I will be back :)",

I had already had the chance to meet the owners and be impressed by their dedication and the philosophy behind their work: they put great care not only in providing the best food possible, but also in delivering the service in a friendly and enthusiastic way. Today I experienced the benefits of such philosophy put into practice: the staff were incredibly nice and ready to satisfy any request, they catered for me as a vegetarian and for my girlfirend who is also gluten free and often feels as if she is missing out considering the gluten-free options in most places. Not so at the Blue Bear. The brunch was very well presented, with generous portions and finely cooked food. It left me complitely satisfied, and definitely full. The prices in the menu are proportionate. The place is very clean and in a quite nice area.",

After having a Scottish explosion of haggis, black pudding, potato scone, meet traditional eggs, bacon, toast, then topping it all off with portobello mushrooms and grilled cherry tomatoes I couldn't even get to the delicious waffle I had ordered in a spell of American ignorance.

    "text": "Being the lucky girlfriend of the winner of the yelp art competition, Roberto, I got to accompany him for a free brunch at the blue bear. We picked the right day, it was incredibly sunny, and walking to our prize was a real pleasure.   We got a booking at 11am. I called in advance the day before to check whether they could cater for my gluten intolerance. The answer: \"of course!\" We got the best seats, those right next to the window. Great for people watching... Unfortunately no people walked past as everyone was probably in the park! The staff on hand weren't Ben and Jemma who we met at the Yelp event, but they were equally friendly and attentive! We were told we could order anything from the menu... Difficult, considering how many things there are on offer: French toast, pancakes, waffles, granola, fruit, yogurt, English muffins, cereal, pastries... And so much more! Everything you could possibly want for breakfast!  After taking a long look at the menu, we both decided to get the veggie breakfast. This was quite a novelty for me, as I have never had brunch, and don't usually go for British flavours. For Robbie this consisted of: Eggs (he had the choice to have them fried, poached or scrambled, he picked the latter), two veggie sausages, a potato scone, a piece of chunky (homemade-looking) toast, two grilled portobello mushrooms, 6 grilled tomatoes (still on the vine!), a veggie haggis, baked beans, a tea and an apple juice. I had the same, minus the apple juice, tea, bread, potato scone and haggis, add two slices of gluten free toast, an illy cappuccino and an orange juice. There were plenty of sauces available, I went for HP, Robbie went for butter and mayonnaise.   When the food arrived I thought \"I can do this, no problem!\" As we began eating, we started feeling bad for having overestimated our abilities to chomp through this much food. I had a better advantage being without the potato scone and the notoriously heavy veggie haggis. Everything was cooked very well and in a healthy manner in comparison to some greasier joints in town. It was nice to not see so much oil on my plate! The sausages were delicious, I loved how the tomatoes came still on the vine, and the portobello mushrooms were also very good. I would like to know which gluten free bread they use, as I actually couldn't tell the difference between it and some gluten containing brands. There are plenty of seeds and it feels less sweet and more fiber-some than most. Giving myself a pause from eating, I took a walk around the cafe and checked out the Yelper art work, it really is on the wall! Eventually I was defeated by the eggs and half of the very generous serving of cappuccino, but managed everything else. Robbie, the winner, managed to eat everything. It did count as breakfast and lunch though... It's okay, we walked it off afterwards. Being such a beautiful day we decided to spend a couple of hours in the nearby Botanic garden.  Having been here twice now, rest assured the blue bear is consistently good. We will definitely be coming back here to try out some other offerings from the menu, perhaps a good place to take some relatives or friends when they visit? I seriously love the way yelp introduces me to things I wouldn't usually try. If you fancy a very well prepared, relatively healthy breakfast/brunch, do try out the blue bear. The service here is really superb, as is the food.",

On this visit the service was extremely slow for coffees and the actual breakfasts took ages. Unfortunately the cinnamon swirl was dry for Tanja R and Anita A, the black pudding was also a bit dry for Mason R, and the waffle batter was sickly sweet for me - topped with maple syrup it was just way too sweet. It's still fun to visit the Blue Bear but it seems that it's not as great as it once was.",

The eggs were perfect, the bacon well done, hand sliced, not too crunchy, just a tad soft but that made it actually really good (I do this myself now and then). Black pudding lovely, portobello's nicely fried, etc. everything very tasty. The freshly pressed orange juice and the filter coffee was also good. The staff was very friendly.

From their very thoughtful framed sign in the bathroom saying that they know the toilets don't look that great, but they are planning on giving them a revamp in the near future, quoting the 'ugly duckling' phrase, they show that they are dedicated to having a great looking place. And to be honest, I've seen worse gents toilets.    \\\\  M  E  N  U  \\\\ Having the blinkers on again and not noticing the clearly labelled \"Available Mon - Fri\" on the top of the first section of the menu we starting looking at the very pleasing \"1/2 sandwich 1/2 soup options\" which would of went down nicely. But after discovering that this was midweek only we verged over the page to another world of options that had to get the approval of our disappointed soup and sandwich taste buds!   Having heard great things and reading great reviews from Jenny L, Kirsten B, and Elizabeth G to name a few I knew we were in for great things to come whatever we ordered!   So...yeah. We got a Spinach, Pepper, Onion omelette, and a Salmon Bagel with cream cheese, salad and potato chips. Glass of Apple Juice & Cranberry Juice to sweeten the deal. The food was tres YUM and very filling.  On their website they even had the websites of where they source their food from, listing their suppliers <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cafebluebear.co.uk%2F%23%2Four-food%2F4572958614&s=97a05be383210c5e038cc6b74e4babf55edd4e21588a2fe0b7c0a394bceb6919\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">cafebluebear.co.uk/#/our...</a>  \\\\ G E N E R A L   O P I N I O N \\\\ The whole place very bright, allowing a lot of natural light to shine through which really compliment the decor.

Exactly what I would look for in somewhere for lunch, brunch or any other derivative of such a meal.  They have board games and art for sale on the walls. Quality art at that. They have alcoholic options and a menu that is simple but holds pretty much all you could want from brunch. They have french toast and pancakes and waffles and eggs done a variety of ways. Bacon and berries and black pudding and sausage. Ooft!  To top it off they have two of the friendliest founders the city could ask for. Hats off to Ben and Jemma for making the place as much about enjoying the experience and your time here, but also about quality grub.  You'll see me again. Can't wait to try the Eggs Benny!",

I had a few brunches there with friends from out or from town. They all loved it!  Last time I ordered waffles with maple syrup and additional banana and strawberry stripes. Excellent. I also tasted parts of the English Breakfast feast from my friend. There were sausages, bacon, mushroom, beans and all perfectly cooked. The coffee is good too (not Costa nor Starbucks, but definitely good).  I think my mouth is starting to water :-)  From 12.00 midday you are able to consume alcohol and you might try the Bloody Mary or their special Martini cocktails.  Just one tiny remark: I really hope they will start offering pancakes, as during the last Elite event, the pancakes served were \"manifigue\".  I will be back soon, very soon. x",

I love what they have done with the interior, nice and cosy with a lot of photos/art on the walls themed around Edinburgh and its surrounding areas. It is run by a very friendly and always smiling young couple.  It was my second visit this morning to check out their takeaway breakfast roll for our Friday office roll (Well, that's my excuse). We have a winner. Very good Lincoln sausages in a possibly the best rolls in the area. Their coffee is from Illy and cakes from Lovecrumbs.",

    "text": "Well, shoot. I think the Blue Bear is some mighty fine food, folks. Mighty fine indeed!  I was playing permanent-tourist-turned-hostess to my two American friends over for a visit when we decided to take the plunge and scope out the Blue Bear. We were meandering our way down to the Botanics, and considering just how crazy close the B.B. is to the East entrance of the gardens, well. Why not?? Now that I've discovered this little gem, I think I'd be hard-pressed not to tip-toe on in when I'm snooping about the gardens in the future--or as a go-to for a FANTASTIC breakfast meal when any future friends are in town----or really for any damn excuse one could come up with to pop in!  Our service was laid-back but prompt. By no means did we feel rushed or overlooked during our stay at the Bear. Our server was helpful and joked at the sheer volume of food we ordered: what can we say? Some stereotypes are just True (Americans freaking LOVE to eat).  Coffees and cocktails were delicious. No worries folks--no one at the B.B. will judge you for ordering a wee cocktail at half past noon! Not only that, but the whole place has a very relaxed, cozy feel to it. It's not overdone, not too fancy, but not shabby either. And there's lovely art of Edinburgh for sale on the walls. (One day, maybe I can justify such a piece for myself!)  But obviously the clencher of the B.B. is undoubtedly the food. And what a meal (and then some) it was! Between the croque monsieurs, the Bear breakfast, the banana-and-honey french toast, the ham-and-cheese croissant, and a sharing platter of Camembert, we were stuffed to the rafters by the end of the meal. All the better to explore the gardens with, m'dear! Seriously. What a meal.   All in all, one of my new favorite joints in Edinburgh. So pleased to have an establishment like this in Edinburgh!",

It's quite a no frills, comfortable,  lived in place complete with board games and even ping pong!   Potion sizes are generous, ingredients great quality and prices reasonable for what you get.

My husband ordered the traditional breakfast - complete with our first taste of haggis and black pudding - and it was all very fresh and delicious. I wasn't as hungry so I had a bowl of porridge with fresh fruit compote, which was amazing!! We were blown away by how fresh everything tasted with a very \"mom's kitchen\" homemade vibe.   Overall this was a super cute space with delicious, fresh food.",

We waited a while for our food (at least 20 minutes) but they were busy at the time so it's understandable.  The disappointing part of the experience was the food. I got the vegetarian breakfast and my wife got the eggs Benedict. We had three poached eggs between us and all three were overcooked. One of them had a yolk that was slightly runny and the other two were solid. Much of the vegetarian breakfast appeared to have been assembled from pre-made processed foods. My toast wasn't warm enough to melt the butter smeared on it and the veggie sausages weren't browned much and didn't have any texture. While I don't need a gourmet experience for every meal, I was expecting more for the price I paid.",

The Blue Bear's my kind of place - board games stacked high, newspapers to read while you wait, and the chirpiest, chattiest service imaginable. I could easily begin to nest at The Blue Bear if it were nearer to my house.  I need to talk about the tea. I ordered a breakfast tea, and couldn't believe the size of the pot that arrived! It came with a super-adorable Noah's Ark design on it and was, by my estimate, 300 cubits long, 50 cubits wide and 30 cubits tall. It was an OCEAN of tea. All for me me me me me!  I also had my first-ever French toast, and discovered that this thing people talk about is what we straight-talking folk of Yorkshire provenance call \"eggy bread\", which sounds far less sophisticated. Nevertheless, it was stunning; the maple syrup was spot on and the bacon just how I like it (i.e. not overly crispy). It's a pretty good portion for the price (6.45) too!  Finally - if you're coming for brunch, book a table! The Blue Bear's reputation as a super-hot spot for brunch precedes it and you don't want to be left out when there's so much fun and goodness to be had inside.",

I had the eggs Florentine which was my favorite, and hubby had the omelette. The other bonus with kids was the fact that they have a selection of board games to keep them busy while they waited.

Parking is metered out front in 30 min increments, so...be prepared to wait and have coins at the ready for multiple trips to the parking meter.  We are on vacation, so it wasn't an issue.  If you have a schedule to maintain, plan accordingly.  Today is on the back end of the Fringe Festival and it's a \"Bank\" holiday.  In speaking with the kind lady at the cash register, weekends tend to be busy like today and the other issues previously mentioned added to today's wait.  Now, on to the important stuff!  The food was absolutely awesome and well worth the wait!!  I had the build a bear: two fried eggs, mushrooms, hash browns, bacon and coffee- perfect.",

    "text": "We were looking for breakfast places in Edinburgh and my husband found The Blue Bear on Yelp. The reviews looked promising so we decided to give them a try. It's a cute cafe close to the Royal Botanical Garden which worked out well for us. When you first walk in, you're greeted with the smells of their freshly baked goods which they conveniently have on display. The vibe is relaxed and the walls are filled with art by local artists. They also have a variety of board games you can borrow while you eat or drink.  We were greeted and seated immediately. The menu was much larger than I had anticipated; they have plenty of options for breakfast and brunch. We both ordered coffee (my husband ordered a mocha and I an American) and then our meals. I ordered a bagel sandwich with smoked salmon and cream cheese and comes with a salad and potato chips; my husband ordered the full Scottish breakfast. Our coffees came out first then our food came a short while later. Our food and coffee was delicious. My husband enjoyed his breakfast, even the black pudding. I love my sandwich and it was very filling. Both of our coffee were delicious and well made.  Service was very good throughout our meal. Our server was friendly and made great recommendations for where we should go for dinner. We loved our experience so much that we came back again for breakfast the next day. On that day, my husband ordered the French Toast and I ordered the sausage roll with fried egg. Both dishes were just as delicious.",

I was pointed to a couple who had formed the waiting queue and had to ask for the breakfast  menu (which was printed on a tacky , well fingered , 'greasy spoon' kind of card).  Having been directed to a cleared table, I found the follow-up service to be slow. Coffee was a mug of filtered Americano black coffee that lacked any real distinction. ( Could have been served from a typical Cafe from the 70s).   The double poached egg on granary toast was well presented, but toast slice was too thick (mega carbs). The additional slices of cold salmon were delivered atop a similar slab of carbs.  You should'nt be able to go too far wrong with egg and toast for breakfast. It was the dining experience that disappointed hence the mediocre rating. Staff , coffee and decor let the place down. Plenty of nearby alternatives that likely give better , for less. Over rated, and never 5 star..",

There were multiple pieces of bread stacked high on my plate, which made me guffaw at first glance. I ate most of it, though (how could I not??), and I let my husband have my leftovers. He loved it too. This was definitely the best french toast I've had in a long, long time--maybe even ever. The atmosphere is nice, and the staff were friendly too. I absolutely recommend trying this for breakfast if you are able!",

Well that heart that I gushed so much about? It wasn't a one off story. I have a lot of favourites in Edinburgh, but The Blue Bear remains high on the list.  The interesting thing is, the food isn't life changing. Now now, don't get me wrong - it's good, it's REALLY good - but in a year that involved Michelin starred dinners and crazy culinary innovation, how has this humble little brunch spot stayed at the top? Because alongside their solid brunch mix, their encouragement for day drinking (yay brunch cocktails!) and their ever present cute as heck pooch manning the front door - this place remains the definition of Service Ninja. I honestly don't think you can find two nicer, funny folks than Ben & Jemma. Their love for the place and their wickedly great sense of humour is apparent in everything they do and there's something so lovely about walking through the door of a place and being met with an ALWAYS enthusiastic welcome.  Just over a year ago, The Blue Bear was one of the first brunch places I tried in the city and 13 months later, it still strongly holds my top spot.",

    "text": "The Blue Bear has all the makings of a five star brunch spot, believe me. And I'm literally pushing for that fifth star. I've absolutely no doubt that after a visit or two more, I'll be throwing that fifth star at you, Blue Bear.  I had the baked eggs with spicy chorizo, tomato and spinach. It was a bowl full of the stuff; warming and comforting and flavourful; just what you need on a cold winter's morning. And with bread for dipping, this was my kind of brunch. I do wish the egg yolk was the glorious, oozing kind. I think that would make this awesome eggs dish completely out of this world. I was excited to dip my bread into a runny, warm yolk but, alas: there was no yolk for dipping. - The eggs were a little too far into their oven journey for that. Still, a solid brunch, no doubt about it. I've never seen baked eggs on a menu before so I commend The Blue Bear for keeping things interesting.   I really loved the energy of Blue Bear this Saturday morning, and the fact that staff were still so warm and attentive despite being packed out. The variety on the menu was great, with waffles, french toast and the classics: porridge, granola and toast. Blue Bear know how to do brunch, for sure. - That's why I recommend you book a table.  I'm looking forward to visiting again and (fingers crossed) living out my yolk-bursting dreams.",

    "text": "The Blue Bear is obviously a bit of an Edinburgh legend. We'd heard of it LONG before moving to the city and had stopped in a few times. Our most recent visits were for brunch. After having tried multiple brunches around the city, Blue Bear is easily still one of my favs.   My go-to for breakfast and brunch is the scrambled eggs with salmon on toast. Every bit of it is good. They use Scottish smoked salmon that brings just the right amount of saltiness to the eggs. The bread is freshly baked and thick cut, with real butter; perfect to be topped with salmon and eggs. I do wish, however, that they had better tea... this is a personal preference, I know, but a lot of cafes around town are using Eteaket, Suki or even Pekoe. I would love to have a pot of one of these to go along with their incredible brunch.   They have a decent choice of cakes. But if you simply want a change of scenery afterwards, then you're a short walk to Cuckoo or Earthy.",
