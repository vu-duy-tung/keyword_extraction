    "text": "One the evening of our first day in Edinburgh we decided to have supper before going back to our hotel and saw a sign for this restaurant. We had to use the iPhone to direct as we kinda missed the lane which is off rose street.   It was quiet with just two other tables of people but it was about 9pm. We ordered drinks and had a dish each.  The food was good, though I wasn't all that hungry so didn't eat it all.   Nice restaurant though I could see into the kitchen from where I was sat, don't tend to like that for some reason. Lol",

    "text": "I came into Edinburgh during the 6 Nations Rugby tournament so everything was completely packed. I was tired and just wanted to eat and maybe take a nap. By chance I walked past Hakataya and decided that maybe ramen would be a good idea.  Even though all the other places in Edinburgh were packed, Hakataya was nearly empty. There were two other people in the place and they were together. Despite this, the service was extremely slow and unattentive. There was a waitress who seemed to be training someone else, she should have spent less time telling her what to do and more time showing her how to do it. It was about 5 minutes after I sat down that she took my order and then only came by one other time during my stay.  I ordered the Hell ramen, and even though it says it's super spicy, it was around a medium heat. The noodles were done very well but there was some taste in the ramen that I just couldn't place that threw it off a little. It was good but you know how when you're eating food and some thing just isn't quite right? It was like that.  If you've got a ramen craving this place will satisfy it, but be prepared to wait rather than be waited upon, and be prepared to pay a pretty penny. It's more expensive than ramen places in London.",

Needed more flavor. Because it lacked flavor, tasted a little gamey. However, with some red pepper and ginger made it better.",

My boyfriend ordered a  (Yokohama Ramen) which, from a Japanese person who loves that school of ramen, found it very far from authenticity. The soup was tasteless, the spinach tasted like grass, and he found a spinach root in the soup...  My (Hell Ramen) was great actually, the amount of spice was on the spot and the  chashu melted in my mouth.   Overall 1.5/5 mainly due to poor service. Do not recommend to those who want to have authentic delicious Japanese food in Edinburgh.",

The service was very friendly and the kitchen serving quickly.  However from our point of view, the most important thing, the food was only standard but rich in flavours. One star less in the rating because the rice was partly not fully cooked...",

After spending a month traveling around Japan, I can no longer live without good Japanese food in my daily life and this place is the one for me in Edinburgh! It's small, warm and welcoming with a simple menu of brilliantly prepared food.  The three ramens on option are excellent, but Yokohama is my first pick.",

    "text": "Real talk: I have only experienced Hakataya through their delivery option, so take that into account with this review.   It's Sunday and has with most Sundays, i'm pretty darn lazy. I fall into the trap of using said lazy days as an excuse to cram fried takeaway down my gullet but on this particular Sunday, I knew I had a busy few hours ahead and needed something somewhat healthy if I was going to make it to midnight. So I took advantage of the fact that Hakataya is now on Deliveroo and you can order sushi from home.  In 40 minutes, I had gyoza, agadashi tofu, chopped scallop maki, unagi nigiri (eel) and seaweed salad at my disposal. Yes... I have a hollow leg and a ridiculous appetite.  More real talk: I'm a sushi snob. I'm from Vancouver, Canada, one of the best sushi cities in the world and i'm particular as heck. I don't mind if you roll your eyes at that, it's an eye rollable statement... but it's also True.  So there were a few stand outs in my meal but not enough that i'd rush to order from these folks again. I definitely recommend the seaweed salad and the chopped scallop & tobiko maki. The gyoza were just ok and i'd all out pass on the agadashi tofu & unagi the next time around.  What leaves me REALLY hopefully with these folks is the excellent reviews so far on their ramen. I've been desperately looking for a great ramen place, so i'll definitely be in to give it a go. Plus, their rainbow roll looks tempting enough. But for the time being these folks stay in the middle ground for me: not great, not bad. A.OK.",

No protein at all at the offered dumplings/noodles, only poor vegetables.   Every other Saturday at their Grassmarket location there is another Japanese noodle stand, which we really loved, but today they were replaced by Hakataya. Needless to say their comparison left us disappointed  (and meat-less :P).",

The food is friendly and the service delicious - indeed, it has only one negative, and, actually for me it's more a positive than a negative... it's still pretty unknown! So I always get lots of attention and my choice of seats. With that said, I'd gladly forfeit these perks at the expense of Hakataya becoming busier - they truly deserve to have more custom.

I had the Hell Ramen and blondey had the Yokohama.. both bowls were brimming with noodles had generous slices of pork, half a boiled egg, bamboo and nori sheets.  The yokohama broth had a slight sweetness to it and the hell broth definitely had a kick! I finished the meal with daifuku mochi.. ice cream wrapped in mochi skin.. both the yuzu and coconut flavours were great.  Service was ok, just not intuitive, you pretty much have to ask for everything you want.",

I'm a Ramen lover and I tried so many Ramen in Edinburgh but \"come on Edinburgh people this is not Ramen \" most of the places are Chinese noodle with MSG, water and soy sauce but they called themselves \"Ramen\" Hakataya is a ramen shop it just served badly.  My story begin on a Thursday night, table for 2, there is another table of 4, it wasn't busy but we wait for food for about 45mins :(  We had tonkotsu ramen, pork skewer, Gyoza , and some sushi. Tonkotsu arrived warm-ish, not enough soup, and ramen were soggy, it looks like they made it but no one can serve it since they had only two people working in the whole place. Japanese Ramen it about the long cooking broth, I think they did it but it was warm and it cost about 11-12 for a bowl of Ramen!!! Over price? Yes.  Haven't check that yet but I think they are the only ramen shop in Edinburgh so that why the price is soon high. And it's a shame cause I use to eat ramen everyday.  Anyway, the pork skewer were dry, the Gyoza was nice, and the sushi was OK.",

You dont get the portion size or quite the depth of broth that I would prefer. You also arent getting homemade noodles because, lets be honest, it would be wasted on most people in the UK. BUT, if you are craving a nice, deep tonkotsu ramen, this is definitely your place in Edinburgh. Sushi is pretty dang good too.",
