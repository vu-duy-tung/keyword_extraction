    "text": "Once upon a time this was a chip shop and the layout hasn't changed much since those days, however how a place looks has very little bearing when the only service is takeaway. As a takeaway Taste of China is big on portions and low on price, normally this would imply a lack of quality, but so far from the dishes I have tried this has not been the case.  They cook up the food quickly (rarely more than 15 mins) and they are certainly popular; between walk-ins, collections, delivery drivers, the phone and the just eat machine going off the staff on the counter rarely had a free moment. For me this is a good sign that Taste of China is doing something right.  Sure if I'm honest I have had better Chinese food in Edinburgh and sure it is fairly generic Chinese takeaway but it is fast, cheap, tasty and filling. What more can you ask from a takeaway?",

First thing, their orange chicken was literally sliced chicken breast in orange juice but worse with a chewy gooey coating on it. My friend's soup was gelatinous. Honestly I couldn't even stand to sit at the table with them when they were eating. After they ate (and most had to stop early because it was too gross) they laid on the floor in pain. All 3 of my friends threw up immediately afterwards. It's literally become Armageddon in my apartment.",

    "text": "Man I don't like giving such critical reviews, but this place just wasn't very friendly.  The glass outside says \"5 lunch special.\" Nope. We walked in and asked, and the man just pointed at the menu. The decorations were lovely, but the food was very expensive!!  I grew up eating Chinese food, and I even ordered in Mandarin. I asked the guy, and he's from Beijing, an area's food I'm familiar with. This wasn't even close. Perhaps they were catering to tourists, but if so, the prices were too high. It's a trade off--cater to tourists and be cheap, or cater to authenticity and stay expensive.  The dishes also didn't come with rice. Whaaat. Very sad. If you're a poor student like me and my friends, don't come here. Maybe if you have money and want to pretend to eat fancy Chinese food, you can come. But to me, it's a rip off. Sorry.",

The food is alright, generic Chinese takeaway. A definite advantage is that I've not been ill from it so there's likely very little MSG .   When I crave chicken balls and sweet and sour sauce (very authentic) they're always there for me!",

My favourites are:  King prawn salt and pepper King prawn honey and chilli King prawn fried rice Salt and pepper chips Vegetarian spring rolls  Everything is always hot and cooked good. It is just a generic Chinese takeaway but it's the best one I know of  in Edinburgh!  If your looking for a Cosy night in with a takeaway or a hangover cure this is your place. The food comes in plastic reuseable boxes witch is handy for food storage.   I am a loyal customer of taste of china!",

    "text": "Had to wait an hour and a half from the expected delivery time for my order to actually arrive. I called twice and the first time the woman apologised as they were very busy but that the delivery man had just left - but this obviously wasn't True as it doesn't take more than half an hour to get to my flat from Gilmore Place, which is how long it took.  I called again and she told me that the delivery guy had been calling and knocking on the door - he definitely hadn't. However, five minutes later I finally got a call from him looking for the flat. The food was cold, and so mediocre at best.   Customer service clearly isn't of importance for Taste of China - I understand it taking a little over the expected delivery time but an hour and a half is ridiculous.   Super disappointed seeing as this place has the best reviews on justeat. Definitely will not be ordering from here again.",

    "text": "Taste of China is the closest Chinese to my old flat in Bruntsfield, and is located on Gilmore Place, not far from the junction with Viewforth.  I've never really noticed it before as a Chinese, but with moving flat, I needed somewhere close for food, and so we gave this place a try.  The food was alright for what I was looking for - just some food to satisfy hunger.  The other people that ate it with me were not raving about it as we - it was just a fairly unremarkable takeaway experience.  Certainly compared to other Chinese takeaways I've had in the city, it wasn't the best.  In terms of customer service and friendliness of the staff, I can't really comment as I wasn't the one that bought the food.  But for a basic meal, it did the job.",

    "text": "A decent local takeaway serving good Chinese food at reasonable prices. Their Happy Meal, consisting of a starter, main and rice for under 7 is excellent value, although the choice is considerably limited and there is no room for manouevre or swapping dishes in and out. The kung po is especially noteworthy. The dishes are usually of a good quality and quickly prepared, and most are up to the quality of any Chinese takeaway or restaurant. The premises also houses a chippie but I've not experienced this so can't comment. There are seats for customers who wish to wait on the premises, and a good selection of newspapers and magazines for entertainment.",
