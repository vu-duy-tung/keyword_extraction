    "text": "Two things stood out to me about this dining experience.   1) the ambiance and service is carefully crafted and on point. They handle large groups with diverse dietary requirements with ease and can actually alter dishes to accommodate allergies etc.    2) chefs use of salty elements is truly inspired and quite mind blowing.  2 examples are 1) the bass ceviche - it was amazing and the saltyness was exquisite balanced with the rest of the dish. 2) the squash puree that comes with the duck breast. It is gorgeously salty, creamy and it played great against the slight crisping of the soy glaze on the duck breast.   Otherwise the dishes and other elements ranged from remarkable to less than, I would recommend some of the more adventurous menu items as chef seems to really elevate them more than say, the chicken breast.",

If you order from the market menu and get one of the deals, it's even reasonably priced! I wouldn't say you'll be blown away by anything though.",

    "text": "The service here is excellent - very attentive and personal.  The food however is lacklustre. The words on the page do not translate to the dishes that were served.  Granted the price paid for a pre-theatre dinner (Market Deal) is reasonable.  However, as I didn't like any of the dishes offered on that menu; I had a starter and steak from the a-la-carte (which was limited in its choices too) and it was satisfying at most.  The melon in my Prosciutto and Melon,  was hard and too bland. The steak was served as is. No offering of sauces. Regarding the chips - they were unsalted, and again no sauces on offer.  I had difficulty getting the attention of the waiting staff to request pepper and salt. Thus I had to get up and go to the bar to ask for it.   Satisfying, but not something to return too in a hurry",

    "text": "We recently gathered there for a celebration round and were given the choice of Pre-theater menu options which were 14.50 for 2 dinner courses and 17.50 for 3 courses. I guess that the prices were acceptable, but would I pay it again? Don't think so. Even the a la carte menu was uninspiring in relation to the prices. You might expect a bit more for what you pay for!  The food presentation failed to deliver on creativity and what you got was ok taste wise. I ordered Bruscheta as a starter which was toasted, if not a burned  slice of bread topped with 2 salad pieces,  3 half cut mushrooms and half a piece of goats cheese. It was quite hard cutting the bread. My main was a trout dish with potatoes and sweet red garbage.  The choices from the pre theatre dinner were limited and I struggled to make a choice. Needless to say I did not go for the dessert.  Having said this, the dessert might have been the best part of the meal :-)  They don't do Edinburgh Gin.   The toilets and general restaurant area are clean and presentable.   The service was excellent.  Very attentive.   Would I go Back? Well, only if i have to.  Having said this, my expectations are quite high when it comes to a la Carte restaurants.",

    "text": "Dine is set in a quiet spot and made of a circular room and a fairylight tree.  There's 2 options for food, set or a la carte. A la carte wasn't that interesting so went with set. The carrot soup was too thick and the poached pear was none existent but the goat's cheese mousse was OK. The crisp thing that came with it was vile. Presentation was good.  Mains, we went for artichoke risotto, sprinkled enthusiastically with hazelnuts and passable.   Beef was good, they kindly obliged my request regarding not having my mash smoked. Sauce was flavourful but it definitely needed the extra portion of veg I ordered. My friend was happy with her chicken.  We went for the cheese board that had cheese that felt pre-cut, warm and served with horrible chutney. Also, who the hell only gives one slice of brie?  Orange juice was called freshly squeezed and it was straight out of a carton. Service was excellent though.   Overall, the set menu is good value but it's not worth paying more I think. The service earns the 2nd star.",

    "text": "If I could rate the food separately from the service I would here.  The food was fantastic but the services was very poor.  We has a reservation and still had to wait at least 45 minutes before our table was ready.  After we ordered, it seemed like an ice age passed before we received our food.  The server admitted at the end that our order had been misplaced and we were basically forgotten by the staff.  Then did make it up by camping the deserts.  I really put the root cause as simple start up issues.  If they can get the service issues fixed, this will be another top Edinburgh dinner destination.",
