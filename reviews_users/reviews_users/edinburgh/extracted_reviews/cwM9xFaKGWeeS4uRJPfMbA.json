I highly recommend the porridge; the salmon plate, and the homemade apple scones. They also serve a lovely cappuccino.   This is not a full-service restaurant, but I don't have a problem with that. For what they do, the service is consistently good. You order at the counter, and they bring the food/drinks out to your table.:)",

Our Scottish Highlands tour was scheduled to meet outside of here, so we popped in to grab breakfast.  My friend got a bagel and some cookies, and I loaded up on their gluten-free goodies. It should be noted that it's *extremely* difficult to make gluten-free anything taste good or have a decent texture. That being said, the folks here are clearly wizards, because literally everything I ate was absolutely DELICIOUS, fluffy, not crumbly, and filled me up/fueled me for the all day tour we took of the Highlands.  The owner (I think it was the owner) was so nice and didn't get irritated at all despite me asking a million questions about the food. I wish we'd had more time to sit, because the decor is perfect- it feels like you're sitting in an old timey parlor room.  100% recommend!",

Which is unfortunate because the decor is really lovely, and the building is very interesting. The food here was decent enough, if not overpriced, but the service I experienced was very, very slow and unfriendly.    I came here for an early breakfast, as it was one of the few places open at 8 AM on a Sunday. There were a few other people in the cafe, but it was far from full.   After our order went in, the kitchen staff and the servers just stood around chatting with each other for a good 15 minutes. I don't like to bash service, but it took nearly half an hour (!) to get a bagel with cream cheese and smoked salmon, and a cup of coffee (the bagel wasn't even toasted or anything... there is no reason this should have taken so long). My latte was also literally just a cup of steamed milk with what seemed like a drop of espresso in it... not sure if that was a fluke... I was in a hurry so I didn't bother asking for a new one, maybe I'll give them the benefit of the doubt?   Short version: the place was virtually empty, but it still took 30 minutes to get a bagel, and my coffee had no coffee in it.",

    "text": "A nice place that opens fairly early and has some pretty good options for breakfast. I've only ever stopped for some take away breakfast, which are usually the morning rolls, scones, or bagels.  Coming in early in the morning means there isn't much of a wait. The staff is nice and the service can be a bit slow but when one isn't in a hurry it's all right. (Not so good if you're in a hurry.) The interior is homey and seems pretty cozy. There are tables outside but I think I'd prefer inside if I were to eat in.  The bagels and rolls are good but the scones are better. I particularly like the apple and cinnamon scone, either on its own or with some nutella (when the scones sometimes seem to be a bit on the dry side). The portion sizes are fine with the prices just a tad much for what is offered.  Having said all that, I do like it and come back when I have more time in the morning to spare.",

Its hard to screw up some eggs and bacon and sausage but they gave it a good go!  The eggs were scrambled but seemed like they were sat in a puddle of water!  The food was edible, but only just.  I don't know what it is but it was hard to find a decent breakfast in Edinburgh!  I did however like the coffee and also the cafe itself, which used to be the workshop of the Deacon (who's real name I have forgotten) and the story behind this guy.  Although a respected cabinetmaker, he was also a thief and he and his friend and co-crook were hanged on gallows that the cabinetmaker built!  I'll bet the guy wished he didn't do such a great job on them!",

I was pleasantly surprised then, when down the end of a wee close sat the quaint little cafe, which was full of tourists, granted, but very reasonably priced and cosy.  I was in there on my own, which I don't do often, and the staff were very nice and perhaps made a little extra effort to chat to me more because I was a nigel no pals! I had the soup and sandwich deal which was only just over 5. The lentil broth was tasty and piping hot, perfect for dipping my cheddar and ham sandwiches in. Bliss! For the deal and a coffee I left with a good couple of quid change from a tenner, which you can't often say after lunching on the Royal Mile!",

    "text": "We had toured Edinburgh Castle and decided to get away from the castle area before looking for lunch.  We thought we might have better luck if you get away from the main tourist area and if we found a place where the local Scots might eat.  Our idea worked well.  We found Deacons House Cafe a few blocks from the castle and it did not appear to be a \"tourist hangout\".  This is a great little soup and sandwich shop with some good salads also on the menu. It proved to be a great place to grab a good soup and sandwich type lunch.  The staff was very personable and quite friendly.",

The carrot cake and coffee were great, however we have had better scones from takeaway place in London. The staff was indifferent and cold. I will not go again, but recommend for quick coffee takeaway!",

This one has the addrd cache' of being in Deacon Brodie's firmer cabinet shop. Much is made of the history via paintings and plaque's. Bonus points for that connection.   The service was friendly and great.    The food and drink selection was limited, but OK. Our Apple Scone was dry, but the Banana Cake was moust and good. Our coke and Pear Cider were both good; hard to go wrong there!  Prices are low to fair. That works!",

    "text": "Located near the Scottish Castle on Royal Mile in one of the prime spots.  The cafe has a figure of Deacon Brodie leading into a corridor and then the actual cafe. The place is rather small with seating inside as well as some outside. One must place the order at the register and they give you a waiting number which you display on your table and they will bring out the food to you.   They have cakes, crepes, tea, soups, sandwiches for lunch but the food was rather disappointing. Had the tuna sandwich along with apple scone and cafe latte. The sandwich did not have any taste to it and the scone was very crumbly and barely edible. Coffee was ok. Service was very slow and they took a long time to bring it out despite a reminder to the server. Very unfriendly at the register as well as serving too - everyone was just rushing by and were not courteous at this busy hour. I did not go back to this place and will not recommend to anyone.",

The staff were very friendly and on the ball at all times, quick to clear tables and any spillages, quick to serve. The food, especially the cream cheese and salmon bagel was delicious and a pot of tea which all came to 9:10 which I thought was fair. The atmosphere was cosy and warm and there were points of interest on the wall; murals and information about Deacon Brodie, however unless the cafe was empty it was hard to take a good look around without breathing on peoples food while they eat but I would definitely recommend.",
