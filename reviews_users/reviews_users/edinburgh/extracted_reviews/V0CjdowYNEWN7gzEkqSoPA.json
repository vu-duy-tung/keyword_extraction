We stopped in late at night on my husband's last night in Edinburgh for some final deep-fried Mars bars, which are a favorite of his. Unlike many other similar places, this area has seating and a larger waiting area than most similar locations. Good spot for cheap late-night food.",

    "text": "Obviously, this is a regular takeaway or eat-in joint in Edinburgh. A lot of the places have pretty much the same menu and near the same prices. The prices at Uncle's are pretty good and I enjoyed the service. We ate here 2 separate nights in Edinburgh and it was consistent and yummy both nights. Fed 4 people for under 25 one night and under 20 another night which can't be beat. I also didn't get sick either time (winning). We didn't inside, we got takeaway both nights, but it was really good and you get a lot for what you pay for. Good, cheap, fulling, and greasily delicious food. I'll come by here again without issue.",

Odd thing was, the salad that came with it wasn't dressed at all. The service was quick and friendly staff. They had the quintessential deep fried Mars bars, which I didn't try.",

    "text": "We need some food so popped in for a quick bit to eat before a gig in Bannermans. Walking past the window I spied someones fish and chips this looked great so in we treked. The restaurant its self looked nice and clean. The chippy area for take aways was turned out in a similar way. We had a nice exchange with the staff and your usual chippy fair was on offer plus kebabs pizzas etc. Ok pretty much what we need from convience food. My friends ordered chips and cheese, a bag of chips and for myself a single fish. We then headed off to eat this on the hoof. The chips seemed like they were reheated and tasted like bad oil. The cheese was imitation cheese, this is cheese made from vegetable oil urrggh. It was really bad. The fish was okay and reasonably priced for the end of town, but really was a bit ...... meh.  I guess this place would be fine if you were drunk and wandering home, so wouldnt notice. We had just finished work however so were fully aware of what ended up in the bin.",

    "text": "\"Uncle\" is an expansive category, umbrella-ing more avuncular subsets than I feel credentialed to disclose. There are, for instance, the juggling-adept uncles, the juggling-inept uncles, the moustached uncles, the \"I'll say it's a 'moustache' in bouts of insecure and misguided self-justification but I know it's really just second-rate stubble in the philtrum-region of the face-region\" uncles, and so on. I daren't tarry. What brings me here today is one avuncular subset (henceforth avunc) in particular, the restaurant-ified uncles. This avunc is home to none other than Uncle Fish & Chips of Edinburgh, the restaurant I am presently \"reviewing.\" I would recommend going drunk.",

    "text": "As a child, I was always told: If you can't say anything nice, then it's probably best to keep quiet. As an adult I find sometimes it's better to speak up and in this case, warn folk before they head to one of the worst chippies in town. Admittedly, this might sound a little harsh.   We were heading to a gig at Bannerman's last Friday, the pints had already started flowing and we were really just looking for a simple carb laden pick-me-up before more merriment ensued. Uncle's seemed as good place as any.   There was three of us present - Al had fish, Dave had chips and I had chips and cheese - all of which fairly standard fayre for a chippy, one would say. The fish was apparently \"okay\" but I certainly cannot say the same about my food. The chips were rock hard and obviously reheated and the cheese was like grated margarine. In fact it was imitation cheese (as Al informed me). Sometimes referred to as analog cheese - it is primarily made of vegetable oil and pretty darned gross. I think this was the first time I'd ever had this stuff, so it came as a pretty gross and unwanted surprise. The first bin I came to subsequently ended up more full than I on that particular evening.  This might have just been a bad night for the guys at Uncle's, but their choice and quality of their basic products leave a lot to be desired. I certainly will not be going back any time soon.",
