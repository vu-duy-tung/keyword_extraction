We had a smaller menu designed, with three options from Starters, Mains and Desserts. I have to admint - there wasn't one plate that wasn't completely cleaned in the entire group. And, it wasn't because the portions were small, it was just because the food was amazing. Some highlights? Risotto Bon Bons, and Very Sticky Toffee Pudding. (To die for.)  I'd go back in a heartbeat, with our group of 20, or just 2. The service for our large group was fantastic, with friendly attentive staff.  Kudos to Lisa for her assistance in coordinating everything with me. We had a wonderful experience.",

Everyone enjoyed their lunch except me! I eat out a lot and this was the poorest attempt at vegetarian food I've ever experienced in Edinburgh. I would like to try dinner to compare - but I was very disappointed and hungry when I left!",

Mom enjoyed Salmon w/ Mushy Peas - perfectly sized portion of her fave Salmon & the mushy peas were chunky & full of flavor & she loved it   Dad's a steak man all the way - Fillet w/ Chips hit the spot - perfectly cooked like he likes it & the chips were crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside - he even cleaned his place & he's not usually in the Clean Plate Club.... so this should tell you something   I was excited to see Gnocchi but had my doubts about the Wilted Rocket pairing w/ it.....you see, I loathe all wilted leafy greens. They make me gag but I was willing to give it a try & boy am I glad I did   The Wilted Rocket was like baby rocket small & paired w/ Spring Onions in a Balsamic glaze - this seared the gnocchi & made them have this carmelly \"crust\" and w/ the remaining little bit of sauce was finished w/ a dollop of creme fraische .....*extremely* flavorful & finished the whole plate....cause you see, I *am* in the Clean Plate Club   Desserts were Sticky Toffee Pudding w/ Cream for me, Whiskey & Honey Panna Cotta for parents. Light yet extremely flavorful & again hit the spot (which is apparently my catch phrase for this review)   Such a memorable lunch & will def come back when visiting!",

    "text": "This place is world class.  We started with a small scallops starter. The dish had 5 sliced scallops on it with a curry sauce that was amazing.  Although we had already opened a nice Bordeaux, they brought a palette cleanser that was delicious, but maybe went too far in influencing the flavor going forward.  That being said, we had the sea trout and the charred cauliflower entrees. It did not take long for the entrees to take control of the palette. The sea trout was prepared to perfection and the sauce and complements were near perfection. My wife had the veg option and it did not fail to impress.  We did not have room for dessert, but could not pass up a few forks of the sticky pudding with an amazing butterscotch sauce with a tablespoon of ice cream. We couldn't stop eating it.  Good thing we have a big hike tomorrow.  Lastly, the service was spectacular. The women who took care of us tonight were engaged in making sure we had a delightful dinner.   There are a lot of mediocre places to eat in the Royal Mile, this is truly an oasis for a foodie.",

If it's anything like their lunch menu, it's probably fantastic--just the right amount of traditional Scottish food mixed with bright flavors and a modern twist.  On a cold, rainy day the potato and garlic soup was perfect for warming up, as was the beef stroganoff-esque dish I got for my main. And a glass of red wine was the perfect touch for a lazy afternoon meal!",

    "text": "We were planning a ladies lunch, it was second day of the festival and the sun was shining . So where do ladies that lunch go?  We decided on Wedgewood, so we took advantage of the 12 pounds for two courses, or 3 courses for 16 pounds. The restaurant itself is well laid out and had a lovely buzz about it when we walked in. We'd booked in advance which was a good idea as the restaurant as full soon after we arrived.  We went for a fresh salmon starter which was served with beetroot puree and a deep fried haggis with a wonderfully spicy salsa. The salmon was so fresh I was instantly transported to the beach at North Berwick, and the beetroot puree has a wonderfully earthy taste which wasn't too sweet as beetroot dishes can be sometimes. The haggis was beautifully soft inside with a nice crunchy bite on the outside and the salsa had a really good kick on the finish.  Our mains were just as good and my coley filet was cooked perfectly with the flesh still being firm and flavourful. I have to admit I don't remember which wine we ordered (but it was delicious) as I left my friend to order that as I had to duck out and deal with a parking situation at that point of the meal.  If you're looking for a great value lunch served with a changing menu taking advantage of the fresh seasonal ingredients available, I'd highly recommend Wedgewood.  By all means take advantage of the 3 courses for 16 pounds, but if like us you're too full then I'd highly recommend a wander to let your lunch digest then a trip across the road to Mimi's picnic parlour that does Luca's ice creams!",

    "text": "When I was instructed to meet for lunch at a restaurant called Wedgwood, the name took me back to history lessons at school, where we learned about the Wedgwood pottery empire for what seemed like a very, very long time. Don't get me wrong, I liked history a lot, but I think at the time I thought scrawling song verses in every corner of my school diary was more important than actually learning anything.  Anyway, getting back to the restaurant, I think I expected there to be fine china plates, those little, dainty teacups with tiny handles and a butler-type-waiter smiling politely, but giving you a look that could shatter glass if you dared to use the wrong fork, or put your elbows near the table.   In reality, the staff at Wedgwood the Restaurant are not at all scary, in fact they're very informative and accommodating, the decor is fresh and modern, and my lunch was delish. The restaurant has a cosy feel to it, seating 48 people, with a private dining room downstairs, which fits 18.    All the restaurant's ingredients are locally sourced, which is all good, so I went for a salmon, herring rollmop and beetroot starter, followed by braised beef and peppercorn sauce for my main. The two large hunks of beef were perfectly tender, and also a nice change to the usual steak offering at restaurants. A little portion of sticky toffee pudding and Chantilly cream was next on the list, definitely very sweet, but not sickly sweet. The coffee was potent and straight to the point, which was handy, as the strenuous effort of eating three courses had left me sleepy. On the crockery theme, there seemed to be a lot of attention to detail, with spoons in cool, weird shapes, a bowl resembling a UFO and other delightful food holding items.   Very reasonably priced Royal Mile dining, and definitely worth more than just a peek round the door.",

For a 3 course lunch here you are looking at under 15.............. and I honestly do NOT know how. Well, that's a lie, I do, but I don't know why?!?!?! The food is worth far much more than that and I plan on returning several times especially when you consider in some places, that I shall not name, you can be paying up to 6 for a panini..... here I paid 10 and I had a starter of Beetroot Panna Cotta with Crispy Parma ham then a heavenly salad. Oh dear. The beef was sooo perfectly cooked with crispy croutons, sweet balsamic onions, fresh spinach. The moment these plates were put in front of a pretty gobby me and the awfully chatty Jenny L I think a miracle happened. We sat, in silence, in awe, in enjoyment of this delicious food. We did however talk about it for the rest of the day. It was amazing.  The dinner menu looks tremendous and like it could really push some barriers, very exciting! Aiming to go back for that at some point.  But give the lunch a go. It's only a tenner..... what you got to lose?!",

I'd heartily recommend that you pay it a visit, very soon.  Overall, we said: \"I was blown away by Wedgwood. I had a notion in my mind that the place would be good, but \"good\" turned out to be a considerable understatement. The food is of exceptional quality, with quietly understated elegance permeating every flavour-packed fork and spoonful. I can't recommend it highly enough, so would encourage you to visit at your earliest opportunity.\"",

The menu offered five choices per course which is very generous and it was difficult to select between the delicious offerings.  The smoked salmon was a winner - as you would expect in Scotland.   The blue cheese risotto Bon bons were yummy and the beetroot garnish helped cut through the richness of the dish.  Main course of venison stew was tasty although the serve a little on the small side while the corn croquettes with a crab salsa was as pretty as it was tasty.   Dessert was the highlight though.  Before lunch I didn't know that a posset is a type of set dessert a little less viscous than a pannacotta, after lunch I know that I want more posset! This lemon version was simple, clean and delicious.  My friend had the Christmas pudding with a to die for brandy sauce. Wine list is very thorough and reasonably priced and the whiskey selection is pretty great.  Check out the reserve selection for something really special should you want to splurge this festive season.  Highly recommended.",

The service was first-rate, the menu was diverse and incredibly tempting, and the food? Oh God, the food.  We started things off with the Lanarkshire blue cheese risotto bon bons, which were crunchy, creamy, and delicious. My wife had the Chermoula crumbed lamb filet, while I tried their crisped potato gnocchi with broccoli, black olives, sunblush tomatoes, and cream. Both of our meals were utterly outstanding. I don't think I've ever had better gnocchi, and the combination of flavors was perfect.  We finished things off with a chocolate truffle cake and the Scottish cheese board, both of which made a great end to a wonderful meal. This place is great. Even better, the prices are completely reasonable. Honestly, for food and service this great, I really wouldn't have minded paying more - but the fact that I didn't makes this place all the better.

I've lost count of all the times I've stood outside this restaurant and oogled the menu, drooling.  They are a bit inventive with their food - I once had parsnip creme brulee - but have an open mind and you can only be surprised! I recently ate in total darkness in a concept-restaurant in Paris (it was a weird experience but I would highly recommend it) and so I found I have started to appreciate the taste of everything now, and Wedgewood is a total dream.

With relaxed but attentive and friendly staff and service, and a great location on the Royal Mile, Wedgwood has a lot going for it before your starter even reaches your table.  The good news is, once the food arrives, it just keeps getting better.  I had the scallops with parmesan flakes and salmon garnish with dijon dressing as a starter, and they were perfectly cooked -- moist, not dry, and with a very successful combination of flavours. The portion size was ideal for a starter -- five (large) scallops is perfect.  For my main course, I had three fillets, one each of lamb, beef and pork, with Chinese vegetables and pancakes. The meats were all cooked to a turn, with the vegetables and sauce adding depth but not overpowering.  This was a great find. Comparing it to the Grainstore, I think Wedgwood comes out on top. It's honest, Scots-inspired fusion with great values.  When I'm next in Edinburgh, I will definitely be going again!",

I really appreciate it when places that are going to charge you a little bit more will at least have a higher standard in service and quality in food, without it being too pompous or the waiters hanging around your table.

We started with a bottle of Shiraz, and our appetisers included the lobster creme brulee and pigeon over haggis, neeps and tatties. Wow wow wowza! Being American, the thought of eating \"rat with wings\" was a little off-putting, but it's not like they just picked a bird off the street! Who knew that there are farm raised pigeons? My new favourite poultry? Maybe... As for the creme brulee, it was a huge hit. So delicate and inventive, and served with bloody mary sorbet that was fantastic. The chef clearly has a creative side, and it translates so well into the food.  I ordered the pancetta wrapped rabbit for my entree, and it was absolutely amazing! So tender and flavourful, and the sauces paired with it were exceptional. Our friend ordered the scallops with pork belly, and those too were excellent.  For dessert we went for the sticky toffee pudding, housemade fudge, and one more (what it was escapes me at the moment!) but it had a really nice ice cream paired with it. Vanilla pistachio fudge, nummy!!!  There was absolutely nothing to complain about. The price points were very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food as well, which is always a bonus. Be sure to make a reservation when you dine here, as the seating is pretty limited.",

    "text": "On our final night in Edinburgh, we had dinner at the Wedgwood.  I booked about a week in advance.  The restaurant itself is split into two levels - we were seated in the basement, which is small but cosy and comfortable.  The food was good, the wine was good, and the service was great.  We had the pigeon to start, the venison and confit pork belly as mains, and the sticky toffee pudding to finish. All the dishes were fantastic, but the confit pork belly stood out! I would highly recommend this for pork belly fans.   I also really appreciate when restaurants offer nice bread and butter/oil.  Tasty carbs and fat, can't go wrong with that.  Instead of butter, they serve the bread with a homemade garlic herb oil that I could literally take a bath in.    Overall, it was an enjoyable meal. With a bottle of wine, it all amounted to 80 for 2 people. I would say the Wedgwood is good value for the quality and service.",

    "text": "One of the loveliest places I've been. And I was so thrilled when the waitress gave me a little menu that they had made just for me! (I'd phoned ahead).  My starter choices were:  Tomato terrine, cucumber gel, balsamic caviar. Or grilled asparagus, truffle and girolle vinaigrette. I chose the asparagus and it was perfect. The waitress also brought me a little portion of the cucumber gel from the other starter choice, as I had wondered what it was like. I thought that was a really nice touch, and very thoughtful of her.  My main choices were:  Aubergine caponata, confit tomato, artichokes. Or curried white beans, tenderstem broccoli, sea vegetables. I chose the aubergine caponata, as I don't normally cook aubergine for myself, as I think it's quite a difficult thing to get right, so I was pleased to have it made for me by people who know what to do with it, and the whole dish was utterly delicious.  I could have eaten everything, it sounded so enticing. I felt really looked after, and completely safe here that my dietary requirements had been completely respected. I didn't have a dessert, as I didn't have room but it would have been sorbets and berries.  Waiting staff were great throughout, polished and professional, with a touch of warmth but not over-familiarity. Service was fairly slow, but we were in a large group, so it was understandable, and they went into top gear when we mentioned we were going to a Festival show, and made sure everyone got their desserts or coffees pronto.  I loved the food and service here, it was a wonderful experience.",

    "text": "We visited Wedgewood just before Christmas, for the boy's birthday. Such is his curse, that his day for getting older happens to be slap bang in the office party season, so it's sometimes difficult to find places to go out and have a quiet meal. Wedgewood I had heard had a nice atmosphere, and good food from Yelp reviews, so we decided to give it a try.   First note of dischord was being seated right by the front door - but it actually was ok, not draughty and we weren't disturbed much at all, even though the restaurant was heaving.   I went for the sea radish pannacotta, he had the beef stir fry for starters. Mine...definitely on the wierd radar, and glad I decided to try it, probably wouldn't bother again, but I can certainly regale my experiences to those who want to hear about it (green, wobbly creamy and salty... not a conversation you necessarily want to eavesdrop against), it will take a while to forget it.  I was happy to get the palate cleanser (nice wee surprise that) of lime sorbet, ginger beer and crushed raspberries.   Mains.. he had the lamb which constituted of various versions of lamb, although the seaweed coating wasn't a success... too salty for his tastes. I had the aubergine and goats cheese cannelloni. While I liked the idea of aubergine as an alternative to pasta, there was too much goats cheese and the dish overall felt distinctly average compared to the rest of the dishes ordered.   Desserts were cheese board (kindly without blue cheese) and a nicely plated deconstruction of a pear tatin.   So, the food was pretty decent overall, despite the disappointing veggie main. Service... lacklustre. We had one drink order at the start, and a struggle to get attention thereafter. I ended up drinking the SR's water, as it started to feel all Lawrence of Arabia on the lack of liquid front. By the end it was positively dreadful, as we watched the waitresses polishing silver and resetting tables, despite the number of tables still busy and we were still waiting to place an order.. get the bill... anything. In the end, we gave up, and I stood at the till to get the bill so we could leave. Definitely felt like the waitresses were not on the ball, which was disappointing, as the irritation increased the longer we waited to try to get attention.   I probably won't rush back, as I wasn't overwhelmed in the end, although the SR enjoyed his meal, which was the important part of the night.",

    "text": "My friends and I had been wanting to try this restaurant for a wee while. The dinner menu being considerably dearer, we decided to go here for lunch instead. At 12.00 for 2 and 16.00 for 3 courses ..... we had ourselves a bargain!   The menu changes constantly or so it says on the website. So in theory I shouldn't have been surprised that it was not the same as the one on the website. But... I was. A little. My fault entirely. You see.. I had spent days studying the menu and picking out exactly what I wanted to order!   The 'new menu' however did not disappoint.   I ordered a smoked paprika pork loin with black pudding, parsnip crisps and a tapenade for my starter (3.50 added supplement). The plate of food looked so beautiful, it felt criminal to dive in. But I did. And it was gorge. The pork was 'melt-in-the-mouth' tender and the parsnip crisps and the black pudding just made it perfect!   I got the venison ragout with some posh mash (it had peas and parsley) and celeriac puree for my main. And THAT was some ragout. If I could get Mr Wedgwood to share that recipe, I'd cook it every week! Without a doubt. Lovely and rich with individual bits of carrots, sweet potato, shallots and venison cooked to perfection.   For dessert, after a mighty tug of war between the other choices which included a chai panna cotta with cardamom biscuits and some orange something, I settled on a de-constructed Tiramisu. This arrived with a chocolate brownie topped with chantilly cream infused with orange and a coffee granita. Absolutely stunning.   The menu offers a great choice of wines including the choice of ordering half bottles. I had the Cabernet Merlot, Seabrook, Western Cape, 2010 which was delightful.   All in all, brilliant food, fab service, great attention to detail and pretty darn reasonable. Will definitely be back again and very soon too!!",

Starters, mains and cheese could not be faulted - there was no room for dessert (not that portions are too big - we just weren't that hungry).

Only downside would be the premises: well appointed, but not \"airy\" enough (downstairs is windowless, upstairs has (nice) kitchen smells.

A colleague decided she wanted to have her leaving lunch here so offer went earlier this week to see what they had to offer.  For starter I went for the fishcakes. 2 small cakes, with a little salad and salsa. Crispy fishcakes with a soft potato filling and haddock flavour. Pretty darn good i would say. This would on its own merit 4 stars.  For the main I went for the meatballs with blackpudding and mash potato. The meatballs for a fine dining restaurant were erm rustic. Very roughly chopped onion sticking out, quite small and really didnt look like anythign special. The blackpudding was mixed itno the potato and just somehow lacked any flavour at all. The meatballs needed more caramelisation on the outside and a good bit more seasoning. The mash needed to not have blackpudding in it and have more seasining. In such a simple dish while the presentation was ok it just didnt work as a dish at all.  Actually for this dish on its own it would be 2 stars. The service and the fishcakes even it out as a 3 star overall.  Really disappointing all in alo",

Although I tried to go in without any expectations, I was just severely underwhelmed.  The food was ok. I had the scallops to start, which was tasty, but at 12.95, I was hoping for more than 2 scallops cut in half to make 4 morsels.. Same could be said about the minute portion of langostine which arrived on our dining companion's plate. D had pigeon which was good, although overpowered by the haggis it was served with.  I had the rabbit wrapped in pancetta and have to agree with Grace that it was delicious, although slightly over salted. D had the deer which I found to be a total let down. The meat wasn't very flavourful, lacking the gaminess which I enjoy about deer meat. Again it was overpowered by the haggis that it came with. Our dining companion had lamb and verdict was that although the meat was good, the flavours didn't work when you put all the components together.  Dessert was sticky toffee pudding & chocolate brownie which were ok, but nothing special.  Out of the two times we had a server come to pour our wine, they only filled 3 glasses out of 4 each time.  Although I can't say the service was bad, I was hoping for something a little more than the minimal.  Having gone downstairs to use the bathroom, I'm very glad we were seated upstairs. If you're booking, definitely request a table upstairs!  Although nothing about the evening was terrible, for the price point, I very much feel like I've gotten much better value elsewhere.",
