    "text": "So I was recommended this place by a Greek friend for Greek food. On the outside it doesn't look like a Greek restaurant or cafe but once you step in and see the menu it is.   I ordered a sandwich and it was super tasty. It had sausage and vegggies and tzaziki, super yummy. I'm not a sausage fan but these were great.   The service super nice! They're super friendly and nice. Just absolutely lovely.  Its a great atmosphere. It's really relaxed with some artsy flair. Not to mention some outdoor seating which gets lots of sun, when it comes out once in a blue moon. I really like how it feels like a hidden gem yet quite popular.   So overall a recommend.",

    "text": "Really amazing place! We went here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon, and it was packed! With just one table left we were sat down and got the menus. Everything on the menu is Greek-themed, and we chose a Greek breakfast and Greek sausages and eggs. The girl serving us didn't seem phased at all by how busy it was, and took our order quickly. We got our coffees and meals quickly as well, especially for how busy it was.  The food was really tasty, seasoned to perfection. My dish had a bit too much oil on it for my preference, but that's just trying to find something a little bit negative! The bread that was served with my dish was supertasty, and I really tried to eat everything! We had to go get some money out before we left, because they don't take card, but there is a cash machine just down the road on Nicholson street. Great place, will definitely come again :)",

    "text": "I've visited this Greek/ Mediterranean cafe/bistro place three times so far and I have nothing but good feedback for them!!   Being a Greek, I enjoyed the Greek dishes in the menu, including baklava but also main dishes, with pork, lamb, and starters as well like tzatziki (yoghurt garlic and cucumber with some herbs).   Another favourite is mpougatsa: filo pastry with a sweet cream made from milk, semolina, sugar, lemon flavour, with sprinkled icing sugar and cinnamon on top!! Very popular in Northern Greece, Thessaloniki.  Sometimes on a Sunday there might be a live Greek music event.   The service is very friendly and quick. I loved their spinach pie, which they can kindly warm up for you if you prefer it hot!   The coffee was good, they make also some non-standard ones which are popular in Greece: give a try the Freddo one!    If you're up for an alcoholic drink, they have a stronger version of ouzo, called tsipouro, from Tirnavos, an area  popular in Greece for producing the best quality of this drink.   Looking forward to my next visit!! Keep up the good work guys!!",

    "text": "FOOD 5 // AMBIANCE: 4 // SERVICE: 5   Came in for lunch with a friend after seeing all the wonderful reviews! Even though it is super simple and frankly, not too charming, from the outside, it is so cozy inside and you are welcomed by different cakes,pastries and baklava!  The menu offerings are very diverse and offer tons of different options for vegetarians and non-red meat eaters. There are also specials of the day and many drinks, from Greek coffee to Greek sodas.   I got the lentil soup (soup of the day) and a wrap (I was able to substitute the sausage with grilled chicken). The lentil soup was just to warming and has  a great flavor profile! I love, loved, loved the wrap as well! The chicken was so juicy and I could taste every ingredient -- simple complexity!   My friend and I finished up with some baklava and profiterole. The baklava is probably one of the best I have had! It tastes like they use honey (not simple syrup or in addition to), which gave it depth. It was a bit soggy but I did not mind it and actually preferred that sogginess with the majority crisp baklava. SO very very very good! The profiterole was also very good and had a hint of orange in addition to the dark chocolate. I was very pleased.   Amazing food and service was just so kind and attentive! Love cute little places like are a great reminder of the passion all food deserves. Do stop by -- I definitely will be back!",

    "text": "Since my first review of Richmond Cafe after a pop-in during the Fringe Festival, the ol' boy and I managed another visit a few nights ago and left feeling just chuffed to bits! The food was just as delicious as the first time, the service was genuine and friendly, and the bill certainly felt cheaper than it had been during the hubbub of the festival! Not only that, but when we arrived at just at 6 pm, I worried we'd have enough time to eat before their Yelp-reported closing time at 7. No need to worry there on this particular night, as more people and what appeared to be some Greek friends and family arrived well after us, all served with a smile and set up with coffees for the adults and adorable wee hot cocoas for the chillins. It made for such a lovely atmosphere full of good food and camaraderie. My only wish is that they added a few more veg options to the menu--but seeing as many of the starters are big and delicious enough in combo, even that isn't a real issue! Will totally be back to the Richmond!!",

It was so close to where I live...I was recommended by a Greek friend and a local...one of them said that he once had lunch here for almost one month! Then I thought I should give it a try. I went there with my friend for brunch and ordered the spinach and feta cheese pie with Greek yogurt. IT WAS AMAZING. The portion was enough for brunch and the Greek yogurt suit very well with the pie. The atmosphere there was quite nice too, with the sunshine and the view of Salisbury Crag. You know that it was not always easy to find a good place to eat in the UK, but this one was exactly the bistro I would definitely come again and recommend it to my friends.",
