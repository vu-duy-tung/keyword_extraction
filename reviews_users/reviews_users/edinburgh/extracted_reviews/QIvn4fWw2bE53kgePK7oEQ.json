    "text": "This a good middle of the road restaurant/bar just across from the Royal Museum of Scotland on Chambers Street. Good for lunch or early evenings bites. Lots of promotions such as buy one get one free Pizzas (very large) and burgers (burger with vodka salsa is great). They have a nice selection of wraps/toasted sandwiches (including a fish finger sandwich yum!) as well a good selection of mains. Also if your party number is under 6 and you all order burgers a giant sandtimer counts down 15 minutes from the placing of your order. If the sand runs out before the first meal is on the table then the food is free!! I go in for lunch quite often because it's generally fast, tasty and reasonable and have received a free meal a couple of times. Cosy and comfy decor gives the place a relaxed feel. I've been in a couple of times at night and it's a good place to start off. There is a seperate bar/dance area downstairs which can be used for private functions.",

Sounds terrible doesn't it, but read again and you'll notice such shoddy characteristics are not the fault of Revolution itself, its more the clientele.   Catch Revolution on any weekend night and it's just plain rowdy. Its popular with students, locals, even a few meaty bruisers and this forms an unruly lot.  Still they don't exactly mitigate the issue either, the liberal amounts of cheap vodka sours and heavily alcoholic cocktails (not particularly nice either) are the catalyst here.  Best avoided.",

    "text": "Also known as Vodka Rev to the student crowd, this place is quite popular most days of the week, particular of course on weekends. It's relatively cheap place with various bars located in different rooms. (which are all open on Friday-Saturday nights, not through out the whole week).  They have primarily a large variety of vodka flavours, and you can try a choice of these on vodka \"sticks\" a selection of shots.Both occasions I tried these sticks, I thought what a waste of money- all the flavours offered were disappointing and a few disgusting!  Tye also serve exotic looking pitchers of cocktails.Thing is you think you are getting a good deal, until you realise than most of the pitcher is composed of ice cubes.  There is a dance floor and the crowds can vary from students to more... well to more chavvy to put it bluntly. It's the sort of place that's trying to be sophisticated and swish without really achieving the ambiance for this. Instead it comes off as a bit cheap for a cocktail bar, but more of a cheap and cheerful place. During the day they also serve food, and their veggie burger is quite good and comes with under cooked chips and a rather bland salad. But they do have 241 deals on food most days of the week anyway.  However, eating in a darkly lit, windowless bar with TV screens blazing out videos promoting vodka deals and people partying is rather strange. There are lots of couches and bars and it can hold quite a few people. You can also hire out one of the rooms for functions, but call first to arrange this. Oh and on  a weekend don't forget your ID the bouncers are very particular(and rude) about this, unless of course you are a girl in heels with minimum clothing.Somehow this makes you over 18.    I still don't understand what all the fuss is about.",

The floor was wet and there was drinks everywhere, it just wasn't very pleasant. I have also been here on nights when it has been empty and there is no atmosphere. We visited this bar during the day as a potential venue for an event and while it looked lovely during the day, I couldn't forget how much I didn't enjoy the Christmas ball here.   I see the gimmick with all the random drink combination's and vodkas but I think I would prefer to go to one of the fantastic cocktail bars that Edinburgh has to offer instead.",

Their food is not bad at all for the price. Especially if you go for their 2 for 1 burger night on mondays - you will not be disappointed (apart from the slightly stingy portion of chips that they offer you).   We recently had a party there and the party organiser was very good. She put up decorations for us and layed on some great food. She also gave us all some free shots which was great.   It does get ridiculously busy at the weekends and seems to attract those sort of hen parties with no shame.   The music at the weekend is better than most mainstream clubs in Edinburgh.",

    "text": "Club Revolution is located opposite from the Royal Museum and is easy to get to. This is a very expensive club both in terms of entry fee on the weekends and drinks. Although, there are some drinks promotions they are not especially good value. I can only assume the cost is sue to the high quality of lighting and sound system they have installed. As well as this the seating is comfy. It must be one of the largest clubs in Edinburgh and has three large bars so the time to be served is minimal.   Due to the excellent sound system the music can be too loud to hold a conversation unless you head to the balcony area. The dance-floor is a good size and you will have an excellent time dancing the night away. However, some of the DJ's cut up some of the songs so it can be hard to dance to music at times.   If you are willing to splash out (30 plus) on an evening you will have a great time at club Revolution. If you have a tighter budget not there are many other much cheaper bars and clubs in the Cowgate which you would prefer.",

Revolution is situated on Chambers Street and replaces Beluga Bar. As a result, it has inherited much of the unique decor from Beluga and makes it stand out quite a bit from the other Revolution bars.   Drinks are pretty standard fare and are not great value for money. However, the atmosphere is quite nice and you can either drink upstairs in the bar or boogie away to your heart's content in the club downstairs.   It's safe to say that Revolution is very much a student bar, but don't let that put you off as it's definitely an up-market one and is a great place to meet friends....before going to the Brass Monkey down the road!",

I don't really understand the negative reviews for the place but I have always had a positive experience here, whether I've been eating or partying.  The cocktails are good, my personal favourite Rev choice being Russian Bride, a twist on the classic White Russian, by adding Vanilla vodka and coffee and chocolate liqueur. Delicious. The prices aren't too bad, about what you would expect to pay for a cocktail, but I would like to see a few more options on the menu!  The food is really quite good for pub grub, I had lunch in here last week for a friend's graduation and our combo platter was very tasty, complete with chilli con carne, nachos and onion rings as well as a few more nibbley bites. It really isn't that expensive and my meal including cocktail was only around 14, not bad at all.  The atmosphere at night is busy, loud and crowded so if you prefer somewhere you can have a nice cosy seat and chat, I would go elsewhere!",

It is very loud, and always busy with a dozen hen parties. In all likelihood you will also find members of staff kicking about trying to punt shots and other promos.",

    "text": "I've been in \"Revs\" a lot for drinks over the past 4 years, mostly because all of the uni societies I was in had 'Revs Cards' which give you discounts there. Never before, though, had I been in for food (actually, that's not strictly True, we organised a Christmas buffet here once, but other than that, never sampled their menu). As an after-last-exam treat myself and a group of 7 friends went for dinner to Revs last week.   I had pre-booked a table for 6 but when we turned up there was no table ready for us and we had to wait 10 mins before a table was set up. They admitted they hadn't checked their bookings, because they \"don't normally take bookings on a Monday\". Which is strange, because the online booking system was pretty complex and required a phone-call confirmation of the date. But, oh well. They were flexible enough to accommodate for 2 extra party members so I didn't complain too much.  The food was good - even better considering it was 50% off (a Monday exclusive). The choice on offer is standard pub fare: burgers, mac cheese, fish and chips etc. My peppercorn burger went down a treat and came with a generous serving of fries.   Staff were very attentive and friendly. We also stayed for the pub quiz, which was unusually completed via a Smartphone app. Confused? So were we, but it turned out to be good fun. Doesn't come close to good ol' fashioned pen and paper though!",

I am not a massive fan of vodka to begin with, but I don't mind it in a good cocktail. Unfortunately, the cocktails here are quite watery and taste diluted. We went for some half price pitchers, which admittedly was very cheap (9 and it filled 4 glasses), but even for the price, I think it was quite poor. One pitcher tasted only of lemonade, though it was meant to be 'blueberry lagoon', and the other tasted of orange squash... We couldn't taste any vodka, or any of the other mixers. Maybe the mojitos/individual drinks are better?  The music was also very loud, though the bar is very spacious and there is nearly always room for a big group, even on a Friday night. There is a room downstairs which is verging on being a club... It wasn't the best place to socialize.   Someone came round handing out samples of some dishes, which served as good late night snacks, including a baked NY cheesecake and chips. My boyfriend loved the chips and cheesecake, which looked more authentic than a few of the other offering I have seen around town.  There was a definite American theme going on, what with the loos labelled as 'restrooms', the cheesecake, and a few typically American drinks.  The deals make for some good value food, though I am not convinced about the quality of the drinks. Maybe the food would be a reason to come here, but I feel that the pitchers and extremely sweet cocktails are just ways for people who don't like drinking alcohol to get drunk.",

This Revolution has nice sofas and tables, and the servers have been extremely friendly the two times I have been to this location. All food is 50% off on Mondays (yes, ALL food!) and we have also enjoyed going to other Revolutions in Cambridge and London.   We keep coming back (truthfully, we are only loyal on Mondays) because you can't argue about decent meals for two for under 10! The pizzas and burgers are fantastic for the price and really a great deal, and I'd also consider paying full price (around 8.95) for them sometime if my memory lapsed and I forgot what day of the week it was. Today I branched out and tried the salmon and prawn linguini with the smallest sliver of smoked salmon and overly heavy cream sauce, but the prawns were nice and I guess I could say at least it was good I tried to branch out from my old standbys at Revolution.  Unfortunately, Mondays at this location at 9pm is the very loud pub quiz night, so it doesn't make for a very romantic night out. Mondays are also obviously very popular days at Revolution because of the great deal, and last week the wait was just too long so we left. Every week the service is a bit slow, but 'you get what you pay for' right? For under a tenner for two, I'm usually willing to wait because the food is decent and the staff are friendly.",

Granted it has a party atmosphere you can't dance without breaking your ankle because the floor is covered in sweat, fake tan and apple sours. You know when you're on a night out and you take a photo with a disposable camera and the flash goes off harshly? Well when those pictures come back everyone looks rough and too drunk? That's what it looks like with your actual eyes inside Rev. The only song I can remember them playing was Livin' On A Prayer - which is never a good thing!  Never eaten there but I have a good idea of what the daytime atmosphere would be like. Please will someone enlighten me?",

I actually think  there's some really good bar space going on at Revolution, and compared to some of the other far more dubious hostelries in Edinburgh, I really don't have any issues with coming here for a few stop off beverages.  I still think of Revolution as being Beluga, which it was for aaaages, and which I always found a bit on the pricey side. Revolution is less on the pricey side and has a few drinks deals going on, with a fairly people pleasing, classic bar food menu  that's been pretty decent on the few occasions I've tried it. There's a lot of drinking room on the downstairs level, but not so much on the upper level, which is a smaller space and tends to get pretty cramped of a Friday and Saturday eve. Highlights are the big cocktail pitchers, and the flavoured shots that are a random Russian roulette of tasty and potent",

I agree partly with what Lynsey says about the two different experiences of this play, day and night. During the day this bar on Chamber St. isn't really too bad. It's nothing special but it doesn't so easily offend. Furthermore I can't really appreciate the food. It's True that there are two for one deals, but when you take into account that some of the burgers are almost 7 for what amounts to a very small burger in a bun, a few leaves of lettuce and a little bowl of chips, it hardly makes up for it.  At night the place does down hill. As Anna points out the bouncers are rude. The drink is expensive. It's also a haven for hen nights which can really turn a nice evening sour.  I get the impression that Revolution is trying to be like somewhere on George St. Expensive and flashy but geared toward the younger hedonistic crowd. It doesn't even manage that.",

    "text": "Frankly, I expected better from you Revolution.  Having visited your counterparts in different cities up and down our fair isle, I was disappointed by the lacklustre service and poor organisation I encountered at this branch.  I was in Edinburgh for a water polo away match, and afterwards both the Manchester and Edinburgh teams wanted to fill their empty stomachs with some food, so we headed to Revs where an area had been previously reserved for us.  Despite our afternoon reservation, the staff seemed utterly baffled and flustered by our desire to order food.  After several had placed their orders at the bar,the confused bartenders asked the rest of us to take our seats where someone would be around to take our order, yet after 10 minutes, none of the tables had been attended to, and we resolved to go back to the bar, where we were eventually allowed to place our order.  The lighting in this particular area of the bar is really dark, which would be fitting for an evening setting, but not entirely appropriate for 3 o' clock in the afternoon.  In addition, the tables and even the menus, were really sticky.  This I could forgive, if they'd been busy and having quick turnovers, but again, we'd reserved this area, and they were expecting us, so there's not really an excuse for uncleanliness.  The food took ages to arrive, and was really staggered, so that by the time half of our teammates had finished their meals, half of us still hadn't been served.  There's also NO phone signal in this place, which I know isn't strictly Revolution's fault, but is still very frustrating.  The only good I can say is that we got a pretty sweet deal for our money.  We managed to get some sort of deal where we got a burger/pizza and a pint for a fiver, which is pretty good really.  The food didn't taste half bad either, once it had arrived.  But I probably wouldn't go back, as I'm almost certain I could find somewhere else that provides much better service and still manages to produce reasonable food.",

Without the restaurant side of the business I'd probably only give this a 2 but with it it's a very well rounded venue.   Having been invited to try out one of this place's new main courses for free last week it would have been rude not to go along. The new Italian Sharing Plate was a good starter between two. My Tuscan Chicken (breast with mozarella wrapped in parma ham) was reasonable although it looked to have been cooked too quickly whilst my companion's salmon would definitely benefit from the inclusion of some sort of sauce (that said he opted to not have the lentils that would normally accompany it so possibly they would have made the difference). Otherwise business as usual and still very good vfm.",

A varied menu will cater to almost all tastes they have plenty of space, and can cater to large groups.  I have found the service to be questionable on the whole, not bad by any means, just not all that attentive and it can take a while between ordering a drink and actually receiving it, even when it seems fairly quiet.  Its a modern, fairly trendy place but without any pretentiousness as its a 'cheap' bar at heart and caters to the student types with the promotions and offers for cheap food/booze.    On a Friday or Saturday night though, rammed with drunk people, shots and cocktails everywhere, not really my scene.  All in all, it wouldn't be my choice for a night out, or a quiet drink with friends, but for a cheap, quick and tasty eat, its a winner.",

Thats just the evenings mind you, during the day Revolutionm tries its damned hardest to be a hip and trendy gastro-pub, but really just sells burgers with some kind of vodka twist (burgers flambe'd with chilli vodka is actually really good!).
