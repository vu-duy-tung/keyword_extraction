The food was pretty good but the service not particularly friendly and the place was too cold so I had my jacket on the whole time. Certainly cannot fault the speed of the arrival of food.....probably arriving worryingly fast for what we had. Hoping it wasn't microwaved! All in all, an okay place but absolutely nothing to shout about unfortunately.",

    "text": "I went to Maxies Bistro - with so many options, I went there because of their cleverly placed sign at the bottom of the steps on Victoria St which lured me upwards. It was open late one night in Edinburgh. It was too cold to eat in the Terrace but at the time the Terrace looked too lonely to be eating out from. I sat at a cushy table near the bar - that part of the restaurant makes me think of Persia in its glory, but the food is quite decidedly Scottish. I had the Tower of Haggis - an arrangement of Haggis, Neeps and Tatties fancifully arranged as a tower. It was quiet at the time - just me and the bartender so I sat back and relaxed and paired it with some mulled wine and finished with a great Berry Crumble dessert. Good value. Hurray for free wi-fi access as well!",

    "text": "Maxies doesn't look much from the outside, and to be honest, it isn't up to all that much inside either. Situated just round the corner from the Royal Mile, Maxies is right behind Edinburgh Castle and so it ought to be a great restaurant for all the tourists to go, but unfortunately it is not up to much.  The restaurant has quite a cosy feel inside with padded seats covered in cushions, with a pretty lively atmosphere. The menu in Maxies is pretty much seafood orientated, with lots of fish and seafood dishes, but there are also steaks, stir fry's, chicken and haggis dishes on the menu too. I had the sole cooked in a creamy sauce, which was OK. The sauce was pretty thick and gloopy and lacked proper taste, but the fish was perfectly cooked. My friend had a pasta dish which they really didn't like, she said the pasta was still hard and that the sauce was tepid - not nice. The service was pretty average too, the waiter's weren't that attentive and only seemed to show some life when we asked for the bill.   There are much better restaurants in Edinburgh which are more deserving of the custom than Maxies.",

Very pleased with the food as well it was all very good and had many selections to choose from. The only negative I think is the set up, it was so crowded up there the restaurants were split up outside and it was weird, but it's easy to get around that and is very much worth it.",

It was too pricey to be classed as a gastro-pub sort of place, but the food wasn't really restaurant standard, nor was the service. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, but the what you pay and what you get don't quite tally up somehow, especially when you've got such amazing places earby like the Grain Store or Maison Bleue.  It's just above Victoria Street, in the side of the hill stretching up to the castle, so if you get a table on it's little outdoor terrace in the sun then you may as well just write off any constructive plans you may have had for the rest of the day, because I can safely say you'll be sipping something cold for the rest of the afternoon.",

We snuck in because it was close to our fantastic hotel - Missoni. So the food was no great shakes but not as horrible as other reviewers write. I had poached salmon with boiled veggies and man had spicy chicken something. Both good and not overpowering for a late night meal. We had a bottle of the Maxie's house red. Good for the price. The interior was small ans quaint; a little stone-walled, candle-lit room with a medieval charm. Nice terrace, too. What really stood out was the service. Sweet little cherubs served us with smiles and willingly provided tips for fun stuff to do during our stay. We hung quite awhile and relaxed, chatting with the staff and other guests. I would recommend for late-night meals after a long day of travel or sunny terrace pint stops.  We're told it rains more than not in Edinburgh so give it a shot on a sunny day. Staff easily gets 5 stars, ambiance 4 stars, food 3. Last note - one of the sweet cherubs tried to tell us we gave too much money, to which we replied, nope we thoroughly enjoyed it. Cheers!",

I passed by this little place the day before and I decided to come back and try it out.  It's a cozy little place, warm and comfortable. We were greeted from the door and seated immediately. We started with couple of appetizers such as the infused game pate and grilled brie, and for main dish I ordered the steak with black pudding and my friend ordered the sauteed chicken in red pepper sauce.  Both of the dishes were well prepared. The steak and the black pudding just hit the spot. I also tried my friend's chicken and I loved that red pepper sauce. Veggies were a bit plain and maybe a little over cooked but the dinner was enjoyable and was fully completed with the great service we got from the woman working at the restaurant. I am not sure if she was the manager or not. But she was quite polite and helpful. I would love to come here in summer and dine out on the patio, it has such a nice and unique view...",

I had smoked salmon and cream cheese pate which was much more cheese than pate, then a very interesting take on enchiladas which unfortunately was the kind of standard I'd expect in McDonalds. My boyfriend had duck and orange pate which was horrible; he only ate half of it. He then had steak, which he said was nice but the crevettes it came with were mushy and very over-cooked, and the mashed potato with was dry and crumbly - he said it reminded him of the sort of potato you'd get at school. He thought it'd had all been left under a heat lamp as it was so dry. We were discussing how it had been so busy and the only conclusion that we came to was that it's in a tourist trap. I don't think this place gets a lot of repeat business.   My advice if you're looking for somewhere nice for dinner in this area is to go to Maison Bleue on Victoria St, or The Outsider on George IV Bridge.",

With its beautiful stone walls and lovely soft lighting, it's quite a romantic atmosphere.

    "text": "Our party of three popped in here ahead of attending the tattoo on August 3. We were drawn to it because our son's name is Max, and we very often call him Maxie.   We had a cozy bench inside, near the bar. As a starter, my husband and I split the smoked salmon salad. Thin slices of smoked salmon were atop a bed of mixed greens, with a wedge of lemon and four slices of crusty baguette. The portion of salmon was generous, and the oiliness of the salmon mixed with the lemon juice made all of the necessary \"dressing\" for the greens. We did add a little bit of pepper to liven things up, but overall a tasty morsel.   Our son had the pasta Neopolitan, and thoroughly enjoyed it. In addition to the pasta and sauce, there also were halved, fresh grape tomatoes sauteed in the dish.   My husband and I both had the seafood linguine. The plus of this dish is generous amount of seafood - mussels, scallops, shrimp, calamari, and pieces of salmon. The downside was that the pasta was overcooked, and someone was heavy-handed with the spice as it was almost too hot to eat. We both like spicy food; however, this made my face turn pink and my husband break into a sweat.   What this place has going for it: Proximity to the Royal Mile, cozy atmosphere, lovely wait staff, reasonable portions. Cons: Overcooked pasta, one toilet for the ladies room, little circulation/ventilation in the dining area.",

We tried calling the waitress attention several times and she kept saying that she will be with us later (how disrespectful) and don't get me started with her attitude. At the end, we had to go to the cashier to pay the bill (since no one bother to help us) and when they saw us waiting to pay, they decided to take the dessert to the table and leave it there.

In the depths of winter it was warm and homely, and succeeded in steaming up my camera lens.  Drinks are reasonably priced, and although we didn't eat, the food looked and smelt rather lovely.  One of my favourite touches were the cosy tartan blankets on the balcony. Sitting with a little dusting of snow on the roof tops under inky sky, looking down at the windy streets is rather lovely, and quite romantic if you're after that sort of thing (maybe if you ignore the metal tables though)",

I thought it had a nice feel with cool paintings and couches. The service was really friendly. It did take us a bit to get our food but it's not like it took forever.   It's also a little hard to find. If you are on victoria terrace you need to keep walking in the middle and go up the stairs in the middle of the street since this restaurant is upstairs.",

The seafood was nice, but there was so little fish in it, I barely noticed it was there. My mother ordered the salmon special of the day and she enjoyed it. My aunt ordered the mussels, which had bits of shell in it. She ordered the bread which was burnt. The warm bacon avocado salad was good. My brother had the worst experience. He's vegetarian and ordered the pasta which was overcooked, unseasoned, and had a tablespoon of watery sauce that was basically unrecognisable as a sauce. He sent it back and ordered the baked Brie which was essentially a hunk of fried cheese with no bread and unseasoned potatoes. Do not recommend coming here.",

Inside, it was a lot like a cave, with plush little seats resplindent with pillows and tables with candles.   The food was heavy on the carbohydrates, lots of pasta and rice, but the food was damned well tasty too.  We had pasta with red sauce, and I had the stir fry the flavours were full bodies and well developed.   Service was a touch slow, but over all, I'd come back.",

The batter was not salted or seasoned so there was zero flavour, the fish they used had no flavour to speak of.  The temp on the fryer must have been too low because the batter was very greasy and it soaked right through into the fish as well.  Maybe they are famous for something else but they have no business selling fish and chips",

The server told us it would be about 10 or 15 minutes, she was closing a ticket and they should be leaving soon. No problem. She recommended that we go two doors down at Castle Arms for a drink and we thought why not. We returned and the table was ready for us.   Now the food. My boyfriend had the haggis for appetizer and supper. I had oyster for starter and fish for supper. I tried the haggis for the first time. It was creamy and good. Delish!  We ordered a bottle of wine and shared a pudding for desert. The owner came by our table to serve us the food. Server says he's a hard worker. I can tell he takes pride in his restaurant.   We were happy with the first visit, we came returned the next day!   The only con i could think of is the toilet. There is only 1 ladies room, and on the second night,  someone took their time. If I'm ever in Edinburg again, I will definitely come back for another haggis.",

    "text": "Stopped in here with a group of fellow traveler's for the prix fixe lunch before heading up the road to the castle. The choices were actually pretty good, I ended up with a garlic cheesebread appetizer, salmon stuffed chicken and vegetables for the entree and a piece of fudge cake for the dessert.  The garlic cheesebread was not what I expected. It was served on a sliced piece of ciabatta bread with very little melted cheddar cheese. It was more like eating toasted bread. I couldn't find a hint of garlic in it, and I was expecting mozzarella cheese and this Italian sounding appetizer. It wasn't bad, but not what I expected. I was thinking more along the lines of an Italian dunker than half a grilled cheese sandwich.  The entree was very well done. Both the chicken and salmon were superb.  The sauce on the entree was also quite nice. The vegetables were a bit over done and were very limp and flavorless.  The dessert was also very good, and the waitress made this fun for us by playing a goofy birthday song I'd never heard before and bringing out a piece with a candle in it for one of our group members who had a birthday.  I'm only giving this 3 stars though for the price. I don't think it was a very good value. At 22 pounds without beverage (almost USD$40) I feel like the portions were a bit small and the culinary value didn't quite command that sort of price. It was included in my trip package so I wasn't out anything out of pocket really, but I couldn't recommend it to someone else unless it were a bit cheaper.  Nice little place though. Service was very good and the food came out quickly. Maybe other dishes would be better and priced more appropriately.",

It was really quiet compared to its neighbours but we didn't let that put us off. Maybe it should've been a warning.  Susie had the chicken enchilada & I opted for the tower of haggis, neeps & tatties, a real winter warmer.  The plates arrived & the portions were generous. Well the haggis & tatties were, the neeps were almost non-existent. The tatties looked as though they had been toasted under the grill but in fact the dish must've been keep warm in the oven as both the tatties & haggis were dried out. I tried to eat some from the middle but it just wasn't doing it for me.   I cannot fault the service. As soon as I told the waitress she offered me something else from the menu. By then I'd lost my appetite so they took it off the bill.  Shortly after the chap at the next table also complained. He though his breaded mushrooms were going to break his teeth!!  Susie's enchilada was definitely the better choice.   Overall I would've given 2 stars but for the decent service which gets it three stars. I may go back but when there's a wealth of competition it's better be good next time.",

That is NOT for the food, nor for the ambiance - both are seriously lacking in class, depth and flavour.  The first few visits we tried some food (notice that I didn't use the phrase \"we had a meal\")   Nope, my 2 stars go to A. Location.  They are a in brilliant out of the way suntrap in the summer. Sit outside and enjoy the scenery. Definitely worth a star  B. Service. (not the cooking!)  Their front of house are really nice and the amount of unhappy customers must really wear them down. I actually feel sorry for them.   This, my friends, is what you show visitors so they know what to avoid for the rest of their stay. It is a tourist trap. I certainly hope to see a 'New Kitchen Manager' banner here rather sooner than later. That may entice me to visit again. Maybe. Though I am a possibly a sucker to go here once a year in the summer to see any kind of change has been made.. only to be disappointed.  Maybe next time",
