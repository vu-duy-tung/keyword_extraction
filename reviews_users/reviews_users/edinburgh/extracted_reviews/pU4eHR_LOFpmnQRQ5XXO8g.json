It opens early til' late and is always packed with people, old and young, who use this as a meeting place for one thing or another. There is a real sense of community in here and although I am not a local, I liked feeling that I was kind of a part of it. The staff chatted away to me and my other half as we sat sipping a coffee, and we felt right at home.  The food being served around us was simple, fresh and locally produced fare which was very reasonably priced and looked delicious to boot.  I would come back here in a minute, an absolutely great wee cafe.",

Indeed, such offerings all taste great, but with so many cafes offering much of the same thing at a cheaper price you'll always be left wondering why you didn't walk further down the street in an attempt to find that inexpensive eat. Cafe Grande seem to neither excel at anything or disappoint with what they offer.  There's plenty of these generic places in Edinburgh, and thus I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to dine here.",

There are tables outside which make an ideal place to sit and enjoy a cool drink in the sun, especially as they are in direct sunlight for much of the day. A good little place for grabbing a quick drink or bite to eat, although possibly not the place to go for a long lingering meal.",

This restaurant was one of the few open for dinner that was reasonably priced while we walked around the neighborhood. It's very cute, has a simple menu and has a cozy feel to it.   Most of my family members ordered from the pre set menu where you could pick an appetizer and main course for a great price of only 12.50pounds. I ordered the pork belly which was perfectly cooked (crispy skin on the outside and juice on the inside). Other members of my family ordered the salmon and haddock and also enjoyed their meals.   The staff was very gracious and attentive. We loved our experience so much we considered coming the next night for dinner but feared a second visit may taint how perfect of an evening we had the first time.",

Our panini with salad were each 4.00, with a side of chips (referred to as fries but definitely chips, from a bag) for an extra 1.00. Sitting down in Bruntsfield often costs much more than this so thumbs up from me.  The staff were stellar. We were two girls with buggies showing up at the height of the lunch hour and they happily accommodated us, sympathetically providing me with a high chair when they saw Baby Yelp trying to eat my lunch. They were also very complimentary of the babies when we left, which is always going to win points.   It's hard to find decent places to eat when you're out and about with a buggy as places  naturally want to fit in as many tables as possible, so it's nice to find somewhere which will accommodate with a genuine smile.",

I spied that Cafe Grande seemed to have a very reasonably priced full Scottish brunch (and the vege version too), which includes a small orange juice and tea or small coffee. If you are wanting at least one drink, the full brunch works out cheaper than the various egg dishes on the menu.  So, it was 1 full Scottish brunch for the bloke and 2 vege brunches for the ladies. They were devoured and thoroughly enjoyed by all.  Cafe Grande definitely has more of a restaurant feel, than a daytime cafe feel to it and as others have commented, it felt like there were too many tables. Even after booking in advance, the 3 of us were crammed on to a tiny table that looked like it would be better suited for 2.  I would definitely go back for the vege brunch and would be keen to try dinner there also, as the menu looks great.",

    "text": "This spot's pleasant enough; as a few here have said, it's far from mind-meltingly fabulous, but it must be doing something right to remain so busy (as it was) when there are so many other cafes and bars in the area.  I think they must have finally updated the menu since Jenny L's review because one can now choose to have one's Eggs Benedict with spinach, ham, bacon or - for a wee bit extra - smoked salmon. My friend and I went for the classic and we were both delighted with the result. The muffin was toasted just enough to make it crispy without spoiling the fluffiness and the eggs were wonderfully hot (although so was the plate: yowchio! Warn me next time, please, waitress... I didn't spot your gloves until too late!)  But - oh dear, Cafe Grande - there goes a star. There was no drinks menu in sight so we're still not entirely sure if a range of teas was available. The tea, once ordered, took a goodly while to arrive and we had to ask for extra sugar when it did, since there was only one sachet each.   And - whoops - another. It's not a small place as such, but it feels a bit like they've tried to fit too many people in and so it's kind of cramped. I had to press myself in against the counter while paying so that people could get past and the lady on the till barely said a word to me and swapped over with someone else halfway through taking my payment! Pretty rude, I thought...  So, nice enough for an impromptu brunch with a friend but not somewhere I'd necessarily make plans to go to.",

No one sells gluten free cheesecake. At least no one did till I ended up at Cafe Grande whilst I was flat hunting.  Last time I had white chocolate and raspberry and it was lovely - creamy, not too overpowering and lovely scrumptious raspberries and sauce. The Banoffee Pie rocks too - lovely banana, caramelly goodness! Just don't put it in the fridge if you take it away as the base goes pretty hard (its gf biscuit base remember!).  I love having a choice and there I've yet to try the baileys cheesecake but its on the list!   Service is good. It can be busy so it can be hard to get a seat at times but I sometimes just go to get my goodies to take out.  So, I like Cafe Grande - I love it for the cheesecake and I'm quite tempted to see how it fairs for dinner one night :-)",

Their tried and tested formula of laid back eating and drinking, combined with a high quality of edible offerings, and a mix of local regulars, yummy mums (need to find a new way to say this, not keen on this expression for some reason) and of course, students, who are a continual feature of most decent cafes.  Cafe Grande does that thing that I sometimes think is hard to attain with cafes, where there's a good cross over from day time establishment, to evening hang out. Some cafes get it really wrong, and end up looking more like a school canteen with the lights turned off, but with the ever helpful aid of candle light, Cafe Grande sets itself up nicely as a night time venue, with a simple, but tasty menu to match. It feels very European here at times, with the bustle, look and feel of the place, although if you're planning on arriving at a peak eating or drinking time, get here early, because space can be tight.",

The Cafe is located in the centre of the Bruntsfield area of Edinburgh so it is a handy place to pop into for a bite of food.   Cafe Grande serves breakfasts, as well as lunch and dinner and they have a menu specially tailored towards children. I ordered their cheese burger for my lunch which was tasty, and came with the standard fries and salad, but it was quite pricey at 7. Their lunch menu includes panini's, wraps and salads. Cafe Grande's evening menu is more impressive with dishes including King prawn Thai green curry and Cajun spiced salmon and prices ranging from 10 to 18.   Cafe Grande, as the name suggests, specialise in coffees and they have a wide range of drinks available. They serve Illy coffee, which does not taste a treat - the milk in the lattes are burnt and there is almost no foam on their cappuccinos. Cafe Grande also serves 'Coffee Cocktails' which are priced at around 6 and include drinks such as Irish Coffee and Mississippi (Southern Comfort, apricot coffee and whipped cream) which I haven't been brave enough to try!   Cafe Grande always has a lively atmosphere inside, especially on a Sunday evening when local Jazz artists perform in the Cafe.",

I have to say though, I wasn't exactly blown away. Maybe I'd built it up too much, maybe the memories of how amazing my recent trip to nearby Gourmet Pasta had been were still too fresh, or maybe it was just bang-average. Either way, it was nothing special.  Being in Brunstfield, it caters for the lunching-out types, and the food wasn't bad. It was just a bit boring, if I'm completely honest. There was nothing on the menu that I couldn't order in one of our student unions, and if I did I wouldn't be paying quite so much for it.  The evening menu did look a bit more enticing, especially as they claim to only use locally sourced ingredients and the range of dishes to choose form isn't huge, so you know it'll always be fresh. But I just don't know if I could be bothered to go all the way over to Bruntsfield to take the risk. And if I were in this area, I can think of loads of other places nearby that would come above Cafe Grande on my list.",

Their paninis are great, the bread they use always tastes fresh and tastes healthy (even if dripping in cheese). My brother said his chicken Balmoral was a bit dry, but the cheesecake was amazing.  Furthermore, they have live jazz every weekend. They have a big board with all the details of their sessions and they are always busy. It's a great wee cafe!",

    "text": "I went here today feeling a bit meh. I was going to meet some clients, and they had chosen it - and I kept thinking of all the other groovy places in the area that we could have gone to instead. Cafe Grande just seems a bit old school, and the menu was all burgers and paninis...  But, in fact, i did have a pretty good lunch. The fishcake was small but tasty, with chips and a little salad - and the cheeseplate afterwards was good, with a choice of Scottish cheeses. Various desserts round the table looked decent too - the banoffee pie got a rave review.  Other lunch choices weren't quite as good - the soup and sandwich in particular seemed a bit dull and \"like something you'd make at home\", while the beanburger arrived looking forlorn on a plain bun.  So - a nice enough lunch if you're in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way.",

    "text": "During my Bruntsfield years this place was bit of a god send for recovery food.  Pancakes, bacon & maple syrup = winner Nachos = obviously a winner Meal of the day= hot or miss but more hit than miss  Add to that a virgin mary and a pot of earl grey and I was well on way to being back in the world of the living. If I was going to criticise this place its that the staff can be a bit snippy at weekends as they are clearly run off their feet and have no space to move.  They fairly cram in the tables and if the mothers and babies brigade are in avoid at all costs! The noise is bloody awful!  Overall though its a main stay as Cheryl says of the area and always a safe bet in global times of uncertainity in a beleguered world of poverty and war.....! But really its nae bad!  Jd = happy man!",

    "text": "Cafe Grande was the first cafe I ever went to when I first came to Edinburgh. I went with my mum because we were staying in a B&B somewhere near Bruntsfield, and hadn't quite got our bearings on the city yet, so just stumbled into the first coffee-serving establishment we found. And we weren't at all disappointed. My favourite thing about it was the cake. I'm a total sucker for cheesecake. And they had really delicious cheesecake.   I also remember eating some sort of sea food there. Maybe prawns, that were deliciously lemony. But it was a while ago. I've been back recently with a friend of mine and had thai fishcakes and was again not disappointed at all. I hear their milkshakes are a bit of let down, but I'm more of a coffee-drinker, so I don't really mind.   The inside's tiny but homely and the service is generally quite prompt, though I think that reviewing service is never completely reliable as people come and go, and every person reacts differently to pressure.",

    "text": "I have mixed feelings about this place. Had a couple of sketchy experiences a couple of years ago - nothing bad, just a lingering feeling of disappointment - however, the past few times we have dropped by I have been very satisfied with our food and experience.  I generally order one thing there - poached eggs on toast and they are pretty well done. In fact they do their eggs beautifully and runny with no hint of fluffliness and so for a fickle egg loather/lover like me they are great as that is just how I like them.  Maybe don't go out of your way to eat here, but if you are in the neighbourhood it's a solid find.",

    "text": "It's an establishment of Bruntsfield so you don't get much more middle class cafe than this. It's a buzzing hub of tea and biscuits which is situated slightly above the usual price bracket for this kind of place (well.. It is next to Morningside.)  The staff is primarily good-looking, slightly older waitresses - and there's not many people I trust more to know about cake than an attractive woman!  Regardless of whether they are or not, the cakes feel homebaked and fresh - I'm a chocolate tart girl myself and Grande doesn't disappoint! Copius coffee without having to wait makes you want to stay they for hours, chatting amongst the usual posh grannies (and sometimes Dylan Moran looking like a right misery)",
