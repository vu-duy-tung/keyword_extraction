Whenever we walk through the door and hear him we're transported to Paris, to a little bistro on a backstreet of St Germain des Pres.   Of all the French places to eat, this is the one that comes closest to the real bistro feel: small, tables close together, Citroen posters on the wall, blue-check tablecloth and wine served in ceramic carafes.   The food is consistently excellent and the menu is flexible enough to provide good value or a blow-out meal. We often go for the pre-theatre menu in the evening, or the fixed menu of the day of a weekend.   The service is always excellent, friendly and professional.",

The soup we had tasted like water and the portions of the food was tiny. When the French water asked how our meal was after we ate, we mentioned that the soup was a tad blande. He scoffed at us and replied 'Clearly you've never had French soup!'. I thought that was really rude considering we made our comment in a very friendly manner.",

We found the quality of the food to be excellent and portions were ample, unlike the experience of previous reviewers. My partner started with a black pudding, which came as a rather off-putting sausage but in fact was moist and flavourful inside. I had an excellent home-made terrine. To follow she had a coq au vin, apparently some sort of casserole is served daily and this was today's offer. It was delicious, the chicken fell off the bone and the sauce was satisfyingly smooth and velvety. I am not a veggie, but I had an asparagus tart in filo pastry, which partly reflected a somewhat limited menu. Again this was first class, with a tasty mushroom based sauce. By now we had pigged out, so we passed on dessert and coffee. The bill was 58.30, which include a half-litre of house white. I would certainly go back, but I can see that the restricted choice could pall after a couple of visits.",

However, foolishly, I did the shallow 'judging a restaurant by its table cloths' thing and always took him somewhere else.  Last night, I finally went here with Joe A, and oh how wrong to judge was I! I wanted to try all the starters, in particular the snails. On this occasion I wasn't very hungry so I just had a main, but I did try some of Joe's black pudding starter and it was delicious!   For my main I had the veggie option, a goats cheese, red pepper, courgette and tomato pie. It was served in the dish it was cooked in and was really tasty. I also tried a bit of Joe's lamb stew and that was incredibly tender and tasty too.  The staff are all French which is nice, although the language carrier was a slight issue when asking for Jack Daniels, but of course you should just drink wine in a French restaurant anyway :) The decor inside is actually pretty cool, a relaxed atmosphere with old tin adverts on the walls.  So, next time my Dad visits I will absolutely swallow my pride, tell him he was right and I was wrong, and take him here! Oh and I will make sure I'm hungry so I can have the snails!!!",

Real French staff (so feel free to bust out your high school French class chops), real French food.   They occasionally have special mid-week nights on for things like fondue which offers a good deal, but the menu is stuffed with classics so if you want to recreate your last French holiday, this is where to come. Their wine list is reasonably priced and they have a house wine which is good enough for me so you needn't spend a fortune on booze. Everything here is delicious: boudin noir with mustardy French salad, terrine, bouillabaisse, cassoulet, coq au vin, all the classics done well. The other night I had a lamb stew. The waiter brought it out in a little one pot serving that he then spooned onto my plate. The meat was so tender that it just fell apart under my fork.  The service is very friendly and attentive but not pushy, and the place has a nice atmosphere as well, cosy without being cramped. Upstairs is probably nicer but even being in the downstairs bit with no windows is quite snug and atmospheric. Although to be honest I haven't been in the downstairs bit in ages so I may be looking back with rose tinted lunettes. There's also outside seating for those three days a year when the weather obliges. But upstairs or downstairs, inside or out, this place delivers every time.",

The prices are painfully expensive, however, and it's literally jaw-dropping to scan the menu once they've sat you down.  The starters are all reasonably priced and I went for the fish soup which was rich and tasty.  The mains are all about 15 each!  You'll be hard pushed to find something which takes your fancy for under this price and it means that you spend double what you would in any other restaurant.  I opted for the roast chicken supreme which tasted amazing (thankfully) and had some nice cheese and bacon to accompany it.   We each spent about 20 each in here and, although it was a great meal, we'll check the finances before coming again.",

This is a real french restaurant owned and staffed by French people who all speak English with a French accent and speak to each other in French. This particular aspect gave it more authenticity and might have contributed to my 5 star review. The food was superb and left us wanting more after each bite. We had the lamb stew, escargot, and creme brulee. Each one was mouth watering and delicious and we all agreed that it was one of the finest meals we had ever had. Their bread was also amazing. When my wife and I return for our wedding anniversary, this restaurant will be on our itinerary. I wish I could eat this right now.",

Petit Paris, despite being in Edinburghs Grass Market, has all of the charm and flavour of a real Parisian side street bistro. Effortlessly cool and sophisticated, the atmosphere of Petit Paris is almost addictive - chilled, friendly, bustling and exciting.  Petit Paris isnt cheap however, but this can easily be justified once you set eyes on your meal.The menu has two dsitinct characters - modern french food and snacks as well as more traditional and special French delicacies. The French onion soup is beaten only by places I have eaten it in Paris myself - not that you would be able to tell you were in Edinburgh as the whole staff team are French and very friendly.  Petit Paris is a fabulous find, and I am already looking forward to my next trip to France - without ever leaving the country.",

From the tiny restaurant space, which feels intimate (and occasionally far too hot when it's busy) to the French waiters to the truly authentic menu, it really is like visiting a mini Paris in the inauspicious looking Grassmarket.  The food is excellent: for main course, I had the coq au vin, my companion had the sausage, and for appetiser the terrine and the escargots.  We were blown away by the food - although it is heavy so definitely go hungry!  The wine was also great - recommended by our waiter, whose service was attentive but not overbearing.  In general, highly recommend.  Just be prepared for the heat and intimacy - I promise, the food and service will be well worth it.",

Although I can't say I particularly enjoyed my escargot (they seemed to be a bit gritty and I'm not sure how good they would have tasted had it not been for the oodles of garlic butter), the rest of the food was lovely and, seeing as I won't be going on holiday this year, I may just have to spend a good few evenings at Petit Paris instead.",

As someone who's both lived and worked in France, it's worth mentioning that the staff do indeed speak French - so if you're interested in making use of the French language, it's not a problem.   With regards to price, I found Petite Paris to be slightly on the more expensive side of affairs. However, I managed to have a nice meal with a glass of wine (no starters,) for around twenty pounds. So if you're a student it's certainly not out of your depth financially, but at the same time I suspect this is somewhere you don't want to eat on a regular basis.   My only real criticism is that the name Petite Paris should perhaps be taken literally. As at times, you may very well find yourself quite pushed for space and it can be hard to maneuver around staff, tables and other customers when busy.   All in all, a nice if slightly cramped restaurant, which has something to offer for at least a one time dining experience.",

We had been running around all morning so this was the perfect place to stop and have lunch. The weather was beautiful in September when we were there so we ate outside.  Our waiter was excellent.  He was polite, knowledgeable about the menu, and didn't rush us to order or to leave when we were done.  Our food was outstanding.  I had the French onion soup. I was extremely happy with my soup. My soup was the best I have had in a long time. Even better than some I have had in France.  We did meet the owner of this restaurant and he was very nice.  We talked about his motorcycle trip in America which he was planning.  He was just a really down to earth guy with a great accent. We did stay for a little while we people watched and relaxed.  Would I eat here again?  Fly me back to Edinburgh and I will meet you for lunch and dinner.  In other words YES,YES, YES.",

French cuisine isn't always my normal choice and I was alone. The restaurant was almost deserted that time of day so I was a bit worried about what I was getting into, so I ordered with caution, figuring no place could really mess up soup...right?   The staff was attentive and polite and beautifully trained. I was served some lovely bread and French Onion Soup. My daughter is a chef and has hammered a few things into me regarding service, and this was top tier. The soup itself was to die for. Rich, complex and truly lovely.   As though reading my mind, I was given a dessert menu and ordered the chocolate torte. OMG. Heaven on a plate.   If you're in Grassmarket, you'll know Petit Paris by the blue and white tablecloths on the tables out front. Do yourself a favor and enjoy a meal here. It was lovely. I can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "I wouldn't normally choose a French restaurant for dinner, but it was late, and the only other places open were pubs or pizza joints.   The waiter who greeted us at the door was super friendly, super informative, and super French (or else he was super talented at faking an accent). He told us right away which dishes they were out of (it was after 10 pm, after all), and then left us to look over the menu.  I decided to try their Coq a Vin (which I realized to my dismay that I'd pronounced incorrectly), and my husband ordered the Toulouse sausages. We also ordered a glass of the house red, which was served in a water glass. Is that normal?  While we waited, they brought out bread and our wine, which was a nice start. Our meals followed not long after, and I was immediately impressed. The dish that was set down in front of my husband was served with potatoes and had a sizeable salad included (which I'm sure he needed, at that point). They also brought out a container that had four different types of mustard for him to try. My coq a vin came out in a small pot, which our waiter then plated in front of me.  I've made coq a vin a couple times at home. At least, I've made what I thought of a coq a vin. After this meal, though, I realize that my dish is a sad imitation. Their version had a bold, rich flavor, without tasting overwhelmingly of red wine. The chicken was moist and tender, and the vegetables within the sauce were perfectly cooked, not mushy at all.  My husband, meanwhile, was so absorbed in the destruction of his meal that he had gone silent, except for the few yummy noises that escaped between chewing. I think he liked it.  We enjoyed the meal and the service very much - much more than I expected going in. The service was excellent, and the quality of the food - even at closing time - were top notch.",

    "text": "\"Sis! Happy birthday!\" \"Bro, my birthday was in June.\" \"I know. I'm taking you to Petit Paris. Woah, look at this city, it's PERFORMING! What's THAT building? And that one?\"  This was the exchange that occurred when my excellent brother stepped off the train at the beginning of his visit last month.  Now then. There are two reasons that Petit Paris was the first place that sprang to my brother's mind when he wanted to take me out for a meal in a city he'd only actually visited once before. The first is that he didn't really know anywhere else. The second is that he was genuinely impressed with it when he came to Edinburgh last and he doesn't like to give shoddy presents; he's good that way.  Well, I see why he was impressed. The waiter who took our coats and saw us to our seats (table complete with cute gingham tablecloth) was cheery and warm, and plenty patient as we ummed and ahhed over the delicious-looking menu. We began with snails to share - yes, folks, I do the snail thing, and if you have not done the snail thing, Petit Paris is probably the place to do the snail thing. Rich in a garlic and parsley sauce, and blissfully un-chewy, they nestled in indentations in the special snail-dish like happy little blobs of buttery snaily joy. That dish, by the way, makes the process great fun and also, when you're sharing as we were, easy to ensure equitable division of the very good goods.  (I like to imagine that I am a hedgehog when I do the snail thing. That's just an irrelevant little side note for your entertainment.)  My main was the goat's cheese and vegetable pie - utter bliss. The number of times things get passed off as pies when they're really just tarts is so disappointing. The difference, of course, is that a pie should have pastry on the top. This, to my delight, did, and the pastry was superb. Likewise the filling; the goat's cheese was liberal although it could have perhaps been more evenly distributed as it took me a couple of forkfuls to find it, hiding as it was under its pastry blanket. Bro was less ecstatic about his rabbit, proclaiming it a little stringy, but generally adequate.  Having ordered, in a moment's forgetfulness, a bottle of wine instead of a glass, Bro must have been happy enough with its quality; it was all gone by the time we left and as anyone who reads my reviews regularly will know, Sis was by no means his glamorous assistant in this vanishing act.  It's not the cheapest place to eat in Edinburgh, but at around 20 for a starter and main it's very reasonable indeed, especially given the undeniable quality.",
