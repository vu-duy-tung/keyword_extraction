We shared a toffee pudding with vanilla ice cream for dessert. Staff was wonderful, atmosphere was wonderful, music was wonderful, price was wonderful.  I could not recommend this more highly.",

    "text": "What a lovely place! After a few futile attempts at an unannounced dinner, I finally got around to booking a table and I was not disappointed.   Firstly, the ambiance. Rollo is a relaxed place with dim lighting, quite small with limited seating but the set up is great.   So after sitting down with my wine of choice, I could have quite happily just sat and enjoyed the street view and the relaxing atmosphere, but alas I was also starving.   My choice: roast pork with apple jus, with a side of roast potatoes and bok choy. For my partner: beef fillet with rocket and parmesan and house chips. For my friend: the sea bass. And oh my, there was nothing in each meal that any of us could fault.   The menu is a bit confusing as I was under the impression that Rollo is a tapas and wine style establishment. There are tapas style starters (none of which I tried so no comment), followed by bowls, then mains and sides. You definitely will need a side to accompany your main unless you are only after a small piece of meat.   And for dessert: salted caramel and chocolate tart which was to die for.   Each item was quite small, however perfectly cooked and seasoned and you will not leave hungry. I think the pricing is very reasonable for the quality of food.   Definitely make a booking in advance so you don't miss out, I'll be adding this to my list of locals and intend to make this a regular hangout!",

    "text": "And we have another new eatery in Stockbridge, this one in the form of a cozy wine bar. The interior is dark and romantic, accented with giant head sculptures and comfortable custom pillows. We were made to feel welcome from the start, and the service was good throughout.   The wine list is diverse and approachable, with short descriptions to help guide your choice. Around 15 wines are offered by the glass. Every wine we tried was good, and the prices seemed about average for this area.  The food plates are mostly designed for sharing. We started with the smoked aubergine on toast and mull crab bon bons, followed by the portobello mushrooms and the monkfish Thai curry. Portions are small but priced accordingly, which works out well if you'd like to try several different things. The Thai curry was my favorite dish. The mushrooms were delicious if just a tad too oily. The starters were interesting, but not amazing.   For dessert we split a ginger sticky toffee pudding, which was small and tasty (and came with a disproportionately large side of clotted cream).   Overall a lovely evening out.",

The very fabulous owner is usually running around on the floor and her team is super lovely.   All of the food is best for sharing and there is a good hit of chilli throughout the dishes. There is a slight Asian theme through some of the dishes, with a Thai like prawn curry amongst other things,  but then there are all sorts of other non Asian things like babaganoush, pulled lamb salad and mushroom pate with fritters. Despite pulling all of these flavours from around the world and it all works so well together in a mouthwatering harmony.   The wine list is great and you can actually see what you're choosing from on the wine list as the bottles are displayed all around the room. If in doubt ask Ailsa the owner- she'll point you in the right direction.",

    "text": "I think I'm more like a 3.5 for Rollo but I'm rounding up and here's why... Pros Food - delicious. Couldn't complain about the flavour or the quality. Wine - also delicious but per glass, it's expensive if you like to watch your wallet. Atmosphere - definite tick. It's a small place (I think it used to be a takeaway?). We went on a Tuesday evening and it was packed, so book in advance. The background music choice is excellent and the lights dimmed to just the right level. The cramped tables kind of add to the atmosphere :) Cons  Service - took forever to order and christ I don't think a smile, even a half-hearted one, would go a miss... Price - It's not extortionate but it's also not a bargain. If you're ordering several bowls between you (I'd get a few if you're hungry!) it can get pricey rapidly.   Overall a lovely local bar/bite place I'll be back to and recommend.",

As long as you don't need to get up to the toilet more than once you'll be fine! :)   The food was excellent quality though, however I'm not really a fan of the concept of tapas sized plates. Personally I prefer my own food unless I'm at a Turkish or Moroccan restaurant where it's a free for all. The concept of tapas is sharing food however I didn't feel some of the dishes were really sharing friendly. It felt like a bit gimmicky.   The winning dish for me was the simplest and that was the haloumi and pomegranate tabbouleh. No complaints from the party for the meatballs, prawns or the haggis Bon bons. Yummy...   The wine wasn't overpriced which Is a trap a lot of new restaurants fall into in the Stockbridge area. I think overall the bill came to around 40 per head which considering we had a 3 course selection of food plates, sides plus 3 bottles of wine, I thought wasn't too bad. Would I go again? Maybe not. However I wouldn't not recommend it for someone to try. M",

We each did the bon bon wine flight which was fantastic. 3 bon bons (prawn, goat cheese & haggis) paired with 3 different wines.   Followed by portobello mushrooms for her and tuna steak for me. The mushrooms seemed to be oozing pesto and judging by the amount of green left on the plate, could maybe have done with a bit less. My tuna steak was perfectly cooked but the mango salsa was lacking the 'zing' that I was hoping for.  I love the idea of tapa style bite size plates and the wine list is varied and easily navigated so I'd happily head back for the wine list and a light bite though probably wouldn't consider it solely as a dining option.",

But we left after our Sunday lunch today feeling hungry and a bit disappointed. The food looks and tastes beautiful but (although I recognise this is a tapas bar and you expect to have lots of small dishes) there's so little of it! 6.50 for two filled 5cm diameter mushrooms was very steep for what it was. I noticed with amusement the family at the next table were looking at their orders (as we had with ours) with 'Is this it?!' expressions on their faces. Rollo had crammed so many tables and seats in today (Mother's Day) that, in an attempt to stop falling over a barricade of stools in front of me, I knocked over one of the dozens of candles and got hot wax down my new coat. The waitress saw the whole thing unfold, but just stared and pushed past us to get to the next table. She was quite sullen, although it has to be said that the other waitress who served us was lovely. The three of us gave it 2/5, 3/5 and 2/5, so I've averaged out the score.  I'm afraid I wouldn't recommend Rollo, and won't be returning..",
