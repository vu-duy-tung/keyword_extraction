    "text": "By far our best meal in Edinburgh!  Very luxurious but comfortable interior, but manages easily to also be child-friendly and relaxed.  I had a tomato and beetroot soup that was perfectly prepared served with soft and simply herbed bread.  The bread was so good we asked for more for the table!  My salt encrusted sea bass was so tender and flavorful, and my husband's' lamb had a perfect crust and rare interior.   Drinks were high quality as were all the linens, glassware, and flatware.  It was elegant without being pretentious, superbly cooked and delicious with the perfect portions.  Even the kids meal cheeseburgers were expertly crafted! The views from the restaurant were lovely and the location just right for exploring downtown Edinburgh.  My whole family recommends this to all travelers.",

The upscale stylish space was set for a large group; but there were plenty of tables open. We think they were short staffed because it took a while to get things rolling.  We had a fresh tomato salad (yum), grilled ribeye (ok), and lamb (good).  Then we had the baked Alaskan (nice flaming show, the cake was eh) and a fruit souffle (excellent). The facilities needed attention; but like I said - probably short staffed.",

    "text": "As far as restaurant themes go, this one really does one of the best jobs, from literary themed menus the literary references across the walls. The drinks were also beyond unique and delightful -- I was particularly fond of the strawberry cocktail for three with strawberries and cream. I ordered mussels and steak. Though my order of mussels was given with the wrong sauce it was still beyond delicious and I have no complaints whatsoever. I did find the steak a touch lacking in flavor, and lightly on the tough side -- I do, however look forward to going back to try out other dishes that may be more signature than the sirloin.",

    "text": "Had dinner here earlier this week and have to say, the food was absolutely fantastic.  We also dined on a voucher but was never made to feel 'lesser' because of it.  Black pudding and pulled pork roll to start.. I was envisioning some kind of bun and thinking that wasn't overly glamorous but what arrived was more akin to a spring roll and having the crunch of the crispy skin on the roll was great to offset the rich texture of the pork and black pudding.  The steak was cooked to perfection and the triple cooked chips were perfectly crunchy on the outside and delightfully fluffy on the inside. The peppercorn sauce was rich without being overpowering and I even ate all the grilled cherry tomatoes even though I don't usually like cooked tomato.   The jaffa cake dessert was slightly over de-constructed making it difficult to piece together all the flavours but the chocolate souffle is quite possibly the best I've had in town. Amazing crust at the top and indulgently rich and gooey in the middle. The chocolate shot that accompanies it is devilishly alcoholic and delicious.  The room itself is gorgeous, high ceilings with modern fixtures, a mix of booths and tables, all with a fantastic view out the floor to ceiling windows looking out over Waverley Hotel, Waverley Station and Princes St.  I was disappointed as when I arrived, I stood at the host stand for about 5 minutes and noone was there to greet me. Service was otherwise friendly and attentive if sometimes a bit curt.   A la carte price point looks fair and I would say good for the great quality of food. Overall, would happily return for another meal.",

    "text": "A voucher deal is always a good way to get introduced to new venues and restaurants. Twenty Princes Street is one of the places we never really thought of visiting.  - It actually has one of the 2 only Josper Grills in Edinburgh (the Black Room has the other one)  It shares the building of an hotel and Juniper Fondue is on the same floor. The entrance is quite decorative, candles in lanterns placed on the carpeted stairs and a great parquet flooring at the reception.   The restaurant has several booths and mixes 2-4 seater tables in the middle of the room. It overlooks the Balmoral and the Mount. Quite a sight at night. Possibly even better during Christmas on Princes Street.    We were shown our table and our coats were taken to be hung. Looking around it suddenly occurred to me that the flooring (short parqueted) is extremely suited for dancing (no I didn't). This notion made me look at the way the tables were placed and it just looked like a dance/ ballroom floor flanked by private booths and with tables added to be swiftly removed when the band starts playing.  Great place for a wedding, not so for a restaurant. It felt like a posh pop-up restaurant.   The service though efficient, was a little lacklustre. No real attention was given to the presentation on the table .  We were invited to get a drink and we took a glass of Shiraz and Innes & Gunn.  We got our Bread & Butter and I decided on a starter. Pigeon Breast and Pear with a 'granola' of hazelnut crumble and pistachios.  This was very nice, well presented and that 'granola' worked very well. Very enjoyable.  The deal was for a Josper Oven Grilled Rib-eye Steak with Triple Cooked Fries and a sauce of our choice.  I chose the Peppercorn and Anita had her Bearnaise. Both steaks were cooked medium rare and came out as expected. However we got potato wedges and not fries (which technically are potatoes too, granted) and my Peppercorn Sauce was a jus with some black peppercorns. Again technically correct.   It just wasn't exciting, not very tasty. I wasn't looking for outstanding, I didn't need to be wowed. I was not very .. eh.. whelmed with the dish on my plate. Steak was juicy, though lacking the promised chargrilled flavour I was expecting.   The location and view is stunning, service was allright. The starters are delicious their steak mains less so.  A solid 3 stars.",

Took a bit to get service, but this could just be my personal perception, coming from another country and all. :)  Visited the bar a few times since I was staying in the hotel above it. Drinks were nice and smooth. Dessert wasn't bad either. Nice ambiance, especially in the room on the end with the big cozy chairs (looked like an over-large living room with tons of cozy seating). Nice knowledgeable staff as well.",

    "text": "I arranged an early dinner here with my Husband and Grandparents.  They were in Edinburgh for the day and wanted somewhere for dinner that was close to the bus station.  I had heard good things about Twenty and after looking on their website, found a deal that is 20 for a main course and a glass of wine or a beer for two people, that was very reasonable indeed.   I requested one of their lovely round marble tables in the window as it boasts a beautiful view out over Princess Street and the mound.    The choice from the set menu deal was fine for the rest of my dinning party but not so great as I am a strict vegetarian and after enquiring about the pesto linguine, I was advised that it had parmesan cheese in it which isn't veggie as it uses calves stomach lining rennet in it.  I instead opted for a Thai vegetable & noodle salad with tempura & coriander chilli corn on top, it was delicious.  I had been worried about it being to spicy but they kindly put the sauce in a small pot on the side so I could add what I wanted.   The other food ordered at our table was the burger and the Steak Sandwich, all seemed to be well received and all plated were cleared, which is always a good sign.  I was pleased to see the beer option was a Peroni, sometimes with deals you can end up with obscure brands you have never heard of, but not this time.  The ladies bathroom had little glasses of fresh flowers which was a lovely touch.  Very good service and it was a nice dinner.  I have rated it 4 stars rather than 5 due to the veggie option not actually being fully veggie and me then being restricted to one option on the menu.  The ajoining cocktail bar Juniper looks inviting and I would like to come back to check it out.",

    "text": "A Josper grill, some impressively sourced beef, and an exquisite city centre dining space are the keys to success for Twenty Princes Street. It served the best burger and the best steak sandwich we've found in the city, and their current lunch deal (two main courses, two glasses of house wine for 20), which runs until the end of November, is excellent value. With a rather smart cocktail bar, Juniper, just across the hallway, for your pre and post-dinner drinking needs, it's an altogether impressive place.  Overall, we said: \"it's a resounding thumbs up for the food at Twenty Princes Street. This current lunchtime deal is quite exceptional, so do make every effort to visit, in the next couple of months. I'll be back again, soon, and look forward to trying other things on the menu, then spending a little time in their cocktail bar, too.\"",
