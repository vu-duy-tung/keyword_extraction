I'm not familiar with Brazilian style crepes so I don't know how traditional they do the, but the one I had was some of the best street food or any kind of food I've had in a long time. I had the vegetarian (though not vegan) Margherita and they put in so many ingredients - goat cheese, mozzarella, pistachios and all kinds of veggies and spices to make a uniquely delicious concoction for 5 pounds. Makes me wish I could spend more time in Edinburgh so I could return often.",

Rehearsing at Adam house in Chamber street, I had 30 minutes to grab lunch on the go between rehearsals and the actual performance. I wanted something light, but packed with energy. It also needed to be gluten free... After seeing the nearby prices of sushi, I went for Tupiniquium. I remembered coming here once for a Romeo and Juliet crepe, reminiscent of my travels in Brazil (curd cheese with guava jam!) and it had been really excellent.  Yesterday I went for the margherita: Goats cheese, basil, sundried tomatoes, pecans, spinach, jalepenos. Everything was extremely fresh, and the gluten free crepe was just amazing. My boyfriend was determined to go for chips, but quickly developed a craving for a savoury crepe, as he saw mine being made. The guy who serves is always really friendly, and offers daily deals such as 2 nutella crepes. There were 3 juices on the menu, which were made there on the spot, as well as Brazilian cheese bread, guarana (a delicious energy drink which is more popular than coke in Brazil) and Brazilian feijoada. He makes an amazing use of space, and I can see myself returning here regularly to buy food when at uni.   The crepe itself was absolutely delicious. It made the perfect pre-show dinner and for 4, wasn't bad, considering the quality of the ingredients. I will be back.",

    "text": "A great pit-stop if you are looking for something quick to eat.  I had passed the kiosk tons of times whilst heading down middle meadow walk. It does Brazilian crepes, sweet and savoury and they are gluten free. It's usually open all day at least during the week and prices range from about 3-5.  On the way to book group, I was starving after a busy day at work and figured I should have something savoury before tea and cake. My crepe was ready in a couple of minutes, well wrapped up in a paper plate and paper towel which is perfect as there is nothing worse when the bottom literally falls out of a crepe and you end up covered in filling. I opted for mozzarella, sundried tomato and basil and it was lovely. There was a decent amount of all the fillings and some salad too which made me feel vaguely healthy. No spillage at all as it stayed well wrapped as I munched my way across Edinburgh Uni.  I'll definitely pop back here when I am in the area and looking for something to eat. The girl who served me was lovely, handing me a menu when I was trying to see what was posted up. The kiosk is tiny but the space is well used - all fresh items are stored in the fridge and two hot plates means crepes can be made two at a time so I suspect if there was a queue, you wouldn't wait long.",

A friendly guy  behind the counter greeted me with a smile with playing playing south american music on his guitar this kinda made my day.   Options are juice, coffee, soft drinks and a daily list of crepes.  I opted for a chicken and cheese crepe which by the sounds of it was what Nik B had. It was pretty good for street food if I am honest and I recieved plenty of food for the 4.50. The chicken wasnt the tastiest of fillings but I  asked the kiosk fella to make it spicy so this won me over a bit more.  In short: good portionfor the price, great service but was just lacking something to push this place to a 4 star for me. Going to head back for the curry option at some point when I am in need of a quick meal.",

I ordered the chicken curry piri piri crepe (5 pounds), which had a lot of cheese and a lot of chicken with a decent amount of avocado chunks and other condiments.  Not very spicy by my tastebuds, but definitely very flavorful!  Be prepared to wait, as the lines can get long and they can only make four crepes at a time.  We waited probably around 10-15 min after ordering to receive ours.    There are a couple of little wooden tables you can sit at, but I wouldn't bet on them being free haha.

Anybody who suffers as a coeliac will know how difficult it is to find quick food when out and about that doesn't taste terrible and is more than just a pack of crisps. And also the pang when you see food porn pictures of things like pancakes and crepes knowing that you can't have any that will ever be quite 'the same'. Well, anybody who is in Edinburgh, be you gluten free or not, must stop by this absolute gem.   They do sweet crepes such as lemon and sugar for you traditionalists out there and then several others with nuts or chocolate or bananas that are all just so, so tasty. Their savoury crepes are also incredible with several standard offers and their 'crepe of the day'; their chicken curry piri piri is a personal favourite, marinated chicken thigh with spinach, avocado, cheese and marinated peppers and onions - yum. Every Saturday they offer up their 'feijoada' which is, alas, a crepe-less dish but is served with sausage meat, black beans and rice.   The crepes themselves are amazing, they're light and fluffy and just perfect. You wouldn't guess they were gluten free like some other items on offer around. They even have a dairy free mix on offer for those of the vegan persuasion.   I make it my goal to go here at least once a week, I would suggest you make it a usual stop too.",

Just go for a wander down to Sainos and it'll be ready by the time you come back :-)  As for the crepes themselves, they are perfectly light yet really filling, but without that omg-I-need-a-nap feeling you would get if they were made with bread. I have tried the 'Release the Chicken' crepe, which was super tasty - however, since then, I've been sold on the butternut squash veggie option (think it's called pumpkin-something or other). You can ask for it with or without cheese, spice or no spice - I asked for mine with a little bit of spice and with mozzarella AND goats cheese. I know, I know, madness! But I had the Monday munchies ok?   Basically, if you've ever wandered past and thought about trying it - do it! Do it now!!",

When I arrived there were probably at least 6 people waiting outside so there was a queue. I thought it was a good sign, people queuing for something delicious.   Tupiniquim is based in a small police box just on the edges of Meadows and a cheerful Brazilian took my order almost immediately. They have a list of daily pancakes with some interesting fillings such as steak pancake, marguerita and chicken curry piri piri. Also sweet options are available e.g. lemon & sugar. I decided to try the chicken curry piri piri one.  It was at least 10 minutes wait for my crepe, but boy was it worth it! The filling was generous and in addition to chicken there was spinach, avocado, peppers and cheese plus additional jalapenos (optional). I really enjoyed it and next time I want to try out the sweet 'Monkey Delight' that consists of bananas, chocolate and nuts.   I paid 4.80 for my crepe, quite happily as it beats an ordinary sandwich any day.",

As anyone with dietary problems will agree, it's a bloody godsend when somewhere safe and tasty appears.  I discovered this place after they'd been open for about six months, asked tentatively about the sign that offered gluten free crepes and came close to tears when told that EVERYTHING they do is GF. Since then I've been back regularly, and have never once been disappointed (except occasionally on horrible winter days when they might not be open).   The couple who run the box are about the nicest people you'll meet in this country, two eternally jolly Brazilians who seem to have bottled their native sunshine to spread happiness to their customers. If you have an awkward request they'll always do what they can to help, whether it's not having the avocado, asking to pick something up later, or thinking about other dietary needs.  The crepes are lovely, and it always amazes me how much they can cram into them. I'm more of a savoury person so tend to go for a meaty filling rather than something sweet but both have at different times delighted my mouth and filled up my belly.   On Saturdays there is Feijoada, a Brazilian stew of meat and beans, served with rice and greens. I can't count how many times it's been just what I need on a miserable Edinburgh day - assuming it's not all been gobbled up by the queues of Brazilians who come out specially or it.  They also make an astonishing selection of fresh juices, often tailored to your mood, and I've seen many customers making faces of exquisite surprise when they take their first sip.  They make their own chilli sauce, which is lovely and flavoursome rather than just spicy (say yes if they offer some!), and also Brazilian style cheese balls - GF of course -  which you can even buy frozen to take home for later.   Oh, and if you work nearby they even deliver at lunchtime!",

    "text": "I visited this place expecting to give it a 4/5 rating at least. I mean, how can you mess up a chicken n cheese crepe packed with the taste of Brazil?  We'll, here's how - 'cause this kiosk pulled it off.  Step 1: be thrifty with the food, and lay the crepe out so it looks it's got more food in it than it actually does.  Step 2: claim to bring the taste of Brazil to your customers, then give them the same old filling that they will get in any sandwich place in town.  Step 3: charge obviously more than the crepe's worth...  ...et voila!   Now, don't get me wrong. The crepe does not taste bad at all. I had the chicken something (not the curried chicken, the other one) which was nice and juicy and I downed it in a matter of minutes. It probably is the best salty crepe in town, but in a town famous for its lack of decent creperies, that doesn't say much.   Plus, my half-empty crepe cost almost as much as some of the biggest chicken wraps in the vicinity, which are incidentally packed with twice as much grub. As much as I enjoyed the thing, I couldn't overlook this.",

We did have to wait about 10min after we ordered out at their outside tables (not much room and it was cold that day) but it was totally worth it to us :)",
