    "text": "NOMNOMNOM.  I love Chinese food. One thing I learned growing up in Dublin is that you have to be careful where you get your Chinese food from. It is a city where a Chinese take away will serve you a 'three-in-one' i.e. chips, rice, curry sauce, and that's Chinese food. Authentic stuff is difficult to come by.  Well, Lee On is authentic through and through!  We headed here for a quick brunch and when we walked in were greeted very kindly. A friend of mine is Chinese so she got to work securing us the Chinese menu and then ordering everything for us, as no one else speaks a word of Chinese.  I have no idea what the exact dishes I ate were but it was all wonderful. we had a beautiful duck dish that was crispy on the outside, soft on the inside (armadillo!) A steamed white fish with soy. What I think was Kung Pow Chicken, but the best version I've ever had. Prawns in ginger and something else. Morning Glorys cooked perfectly. Fried rice cooked perfectly. Some kind of delicious noodles.  It was all great. And with 7 of us it came to a tenner each! Bargain! A great visit.",

    "text": "Not sure if we went on a bad day, but the food was pretty underwhelming. The kind of thing I would expect from your average takeaway (that caters to westeners); not from a sit down restaurant.  The food did not seem particularly fresh / made to order but for the prices we were paying we didn't expect it to be.    The decor is quaint if dated, and could do with a spruce up.  But the staff is attentive and friendly enough.    Not a bad experience, the food was well priced,  but not somewhere I'd go back to.",

The food is much better than take-aways. All the staff are polite and helpfull. I highly recomend you visit this place soon.",

    "text": "After reading such positive reviews below, I decided to try the restaurant out on the first day of my trip to Edinburgh.  I went there around 7 pm on a Wednesday, found myself the only customer at the restaurant even though it was a peak hour for dinner. Nevertheless, I ordered an appetizer and a entree and was waiting UNTIL I SAW A MOUSE STROLLING BY MY TABLE! I  freaked out and kindly asked the waiter to go check out behind the fire extinguishers in the corner as I saw the mouse hiding behind them. The waiter KEPT REFUSING to go check it out (he looked pretty scared) and kept saying that there were no mice in the premise. Eventually, he worked up enough courage to go check out the extinguishers, only to find a mouse hiding there in a \"surprise\"  Not sure how great the food is (I'm sure it's very tasty because chinese food are very tasty) but I ended up walking away because I totally lost my appetite. I can understand that these kinds of things can happen due to the building being old, but still, I did not receive a single apology from the waiters, only to be greeted by 'hey it's only a small mice' by a young man working there. This level of service was totally astounding to me and, of course, I told all the people staying at my hostel to stay away from the place.",

    "text": "This Chinese serves the best crispy chilli beef in the whole world! As a huge fan or crispy chill beef I have tried it everywhere and Lee On wins.  For those of you who want more than just crispy beef they do serve other things too. All the usual suspects are on the menu, I can vouch for the won tons and the beef in black bean sauce all being really good.  If you are a fan of ordering online and food arriving at your door and hour later this isn't for you. They don't do delivery but you can go and pick up from them, they are always on time and don't leave you hanging around if you ring ahead.   The prices are good for the quality of food they serve. I have never eaten in so don't know what the waiter service is like but for a good Chinese takeaway I can definitely recommend Lee On.",

The food had always been tasty and good value, although recently we have been going elsewhere as the rice has had a strong burnt taste and other dishes are not as nice as before.   Would like to try a sit down meal but the fact you can't see the restaurant when you go in the door is a bit off putting. Maybe we'll give them another chance soon!",

    "text": "The New Lee On is a fantastic Chinese Restaurant in Bruntsfield. The food is delicious and there's a huge amount to choose from. The trick is to ask for dishes from the Chinese menu, what I tend to do is ask for a fish dish, or a scallop dish (for example) from the Chinese menu and you don't quite know what you're going to get but it's a brilliant way to discover new dishes. It's a shame they don't have the Chinese menu in English as a lot of people will be missing out. It's a bit of a rabbit warren downstairs with lots of different rooms but it feels nice and cosy. Upstairs has a few huge tables for big parties. The service isnt brilliant, I have had to wait for an hour for a table that I did reserve but by the time you do get seated and start eating it's all forgotten! It's a great place!",
