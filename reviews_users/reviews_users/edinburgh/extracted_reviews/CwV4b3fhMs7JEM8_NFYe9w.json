Let me start with the amazing welcoming staff,  they really set the mood for a delightful experience.  The menu looked appealing and every single dish we ordered was perfectly executed.  Finished with a delicious dessert and a pour of smoky scotch. Went back to our place with a fantastic feeling of well being.  We'll be back!",

From the charming tucked-away ambiance and little differently decorated rooms to the attentive and helpful waiters to the delicious food, this was all in all a True 5 star experiance.   High class dining without pretension will always be my holy grail, and Forage and Chatter has done an excellent job of achieving just that. The appetizers, arancini and \"mushroom 7 ways\" showcased local ingredients, cooking finesse, and creativity. The mains, duck and leek pasta were hearty and satisfying. The dessert, especially the cheese board, was very thoughtfully selected and a great value.   Overall it was awesome. Great service from the staff, who helped us pick wine, and comped a meal at the table behind us at the merest hint of dissatisfaction from the diner. Would, and likely will, return.",

    "text": "Scottish Haute Cuisine? An Oxymoron you say? Nay Nay  When one utters the words Scottish and food...what comes to mind?  Welp usually that lovely delicacy Haggis or perhaps a Scottish egg?  Yeah you don't think of Scotland in the same terms as Paris, Copenhagen, or New York or say London now a days....  But you would be wrong!  The new food revolution in Scotland is amazing. And Forage and Chatter is a great example of the Culinary offerings of dear ol Edinburgh.  Set in a rather residential neighborhood Forage and Chatter is set in a rather unique space. It uses the basement and several other spaces connected together ( room after tiny room). All rooms are dimly lit and add a romantic feeling.   <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/forage-and-chatter-edinburgh?select=fGtG0hul98pvvBtfqQbVlA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fora...</a>  We were first offered warm fried bread with a yogurt butter and pesto spread ( good omen of things to come!!!)    <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/forage-and-chatter-edinburgh?select=9Ae0-uCQyP0zvGumyNYLYA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fora...</a>  Our four appetizers were as follows:  Winter Vegetable Salad, house-made ricotta, herb oil. Super fresh and bursting with unique flavors.    <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/forage-and-chatter-edinburgh?select=MDWViX4peF1q-wOuSlXttQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fora...</a>  Pearl Barley, cauliflower, wild garlic, herbs, hazelnut. I did not know what to expect of the Pearl Barley but it was an interesting fried grain thing that paired well with all of the other ingridients and had a wonderful texture.     <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/forage-and-chatter-edinburgh?select=Na-FdmxAJUP1ocNms1m3Ww\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fora...</a>  My starter (Liver Parfait, hazelnut, mushroom) was an interesting take on foie gras. The flavor was great but the texture was one dimensional...however it went great with the fried bread.    <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/forage-and-chatter-edinburgh?select=AhhOeh37wA6BnPFNM5xooQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fora...</a>  The best starter was my wife's Langoustine Bisque, mussels, leeks, fennel. The bisque was poured table side and the flavors were out of this world. You could taste the ocean the brine. The creamy broth was just decadent.      <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/forage-and-chatter-edinburgh?select=hSMS4bgnjK0Pd8JGkOQ9OA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fora...</a>  Mains were just as stellar: Monkfish, puy lentils, bacon, capers, parsley. If this is on the menu get it. The flavor combo is just so good. Monkfish is similar to lobster and the bacon and lentils combined to give you this meaty textural  foodgasm. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/forage-and-chatter-edinburgh?select=TMj4Gg5C8l-3fF_tTppesQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fora...</a>  Semolina Gnocchi, butternut squash, leeks, bonnet goat's cheese. Super fresh vegetarian option with creamy ingredients. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/forage-and-chatter-edinburgh?select=Y5w6PVsXooYoFIBUrgOcnw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fora...</a>  North Sea Cod, leeks, potato, herb veloute. My friend Mark ordered this and I had to ask for a bite. The cod was perfectly cooked..crispy outside delecate tender inside. The Veloute was silky and rich. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/forage-and-chatter-edinburgh?select=OSmmMucJH6Qq9Ylz-u97lQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fora...</a>  Desserts are not to be missed!!!  My Orange Curd, carrot cake, pistachio, white chocolate was so pretty one hesitated to eat it....but it was a lovely delicate ending to my meal. Subtle flavors with rich creamy textures. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/forage-and-chatter-edinburgh?select=0AQZnhO-KV3tIj3ptlMIig\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fora...</a>  The other dessert Gin Sponge, apple, juniper, pistachio, elderflower ice cream was equally as beautiful and wonderful to ingest. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/forage-and-chatter-edinburgh?select=IZ--tOKeeqtcV0YEOQyj4Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fora...</a>  Fantastic wine list that offers many varieties and prices. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/forage-and-chatter-edinburgh?select=4jng8Xvi_6KlaetJAdf--A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fora...</a>  Service was phenomenal easy, efficient, and polite: Our Maitre D' was wonderful to chat with and he even offered us a taste of a lovely whisky  <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/forage-and-chatter-edinburgh?select=RVCtkcBM07H8gS9EidOSXQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fora...</a>  If you come to Edinburgh this should be on your top five list for dinning experiences",

The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the staff were very friendly and welcoming, all with an attention to detail and finesse rivaling the best restaurants in the world. From the amazing food for all 3 courses to the little details like the heated coat closet (so your coats are warm and toasty when you get them before exiting, genius!) . It was the obvious love the staff has for creating a wonderful experience from start to finish, and the passion from the kitchen to serve the freshest, most delicious ingredients without overloading the dishes and letting the fresh seasonal ingredients really shine that make this place so great. I would recommend this place to any and all visitors to Edinburgh, and I will be going back next time I am in your beautiful city. Thank you for an amazing meal. Congrats on all your success thus far, you all deserve it. Sending food love from San Francisco. You all are great!!",

The fish was flavorful, the veggies al dente, and the beef was amazing.  The drinks. The restaurant has a nice selection of cocktails and wines.  The location. Although the spot is small, the owners  managed to make it intimate and comfortable.  The only negative was the service. Our servers could have been friendlier. They need some coaching on menu/ingredient descriptions to help patrons navigate decision making especially when it came to wines. They seemed bothered by the number of questions our group asked.
