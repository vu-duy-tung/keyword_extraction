And we ended the breakfast by sharing strawberry waffles, which were a very yummy surprise. They had no problem splitting everything up in separate plates so we could all share. We also were a bit late, but the girl there was sweet enough to move some table and accommodate for our group :)",

The seating is a little awkward. My friend and I awkwardly have a \"I am more polite than you battle\" waiting to sit down, who takes the comfortable seat with a back rest or who puts up with the stool?  We both opted for soya cappuccino... and counteracted the dairy free goodness with those massive waffles. I can't remember the exact price, between 5-6. It seemed steep but the portion size was more than decent. We could have easily shared one! I got a maple syrup and strawberry waffle whilst my friend took one with cream, banana and honey. The waffle itself was a bit dry but the maple syrup was also poured quite liberally. The coffee was very good (artisan roast) and the soya milk wasn't curdle, sign of a True barista.   I would probably return if it were in my part of town.",

We were not disappointed! Coffee was good (we're Kiwi, so we're about as snobby as you can be when it comes to coffee). Food was fabulous, although our second order of waffles came looking slightly anemic compared to my first order. This inconsistency is the only thing stopping me giving it a 5 star review.  There was only one guy behind the counter and he was slammed having apparently let the other girl go after a quiet morning.. Service however was still good.. We got our food in a timely manner although not all at the same time, but that didn't really bother us. We were impressed with everything we ate, which seemed like loads... as we decided to share a scone... then a brownie... on top of everything we'd ordered for brunch... We sat in the corner for a couple of hours hiding from the lashing rain and nomming of deliciousness!  Love the decor too... If only it was closer to home I'd be there every weekend!",

It is pretty small inside, a few tables and window seats, but it is nicely decorated with old window shutters painted in a selection of pastel colours which I liked! The service was good, they were very friendly and seem pretty happy to make up whatever you like. It is the usual soups, sandwiches, paninis, but they also have some pasta and filo pie dishes which sounded delicious and make a nice change!  I ended up going for a cajun chicken panini with roasted peppers and emmental. One of the best things about this place I would say is..... they do not scrimp on the fillings, they jam in as much as they can which is brilliant! My panini was lovely, as were my two coffees - artisan roast everyone! Another gold star for that!  The price was also pretty reasonable considering I have paid 6 in town for JUST a panini to sit in, whereas here I had two coffees aswell and it came to less than 7. I will pop in again when I am in the area to try the smoothies and waffles..... they sound heavenly!",

The sauce on top was so perfect, it had some pepper on top that really hit the spot.   The waffles were crispy, which I love, there was a generous amount of bacon and strawberries.

While we were waiting in the cold winds of Edinburgh, the host allowed a group that came later than us to sit first (we already told her that we can split tables). After we sat down, the host was very indifferent when we told her that we are ready to order, and she even rolled her eyes. With this kind of service, it really doesn't matter how the food is. There are plenty of brunch places nearby, so I don't recommend coming in this cafe.",

I will preface the next review by saying I have eaten Eggs Benedict in restaurants all over the world my entire adult life. That being said, I requested my whites be cooked well, as the previous morning I was served mucous eggs at a different place. My eggs came out hard boiled. I was asked if they were ok. I didn't want to cause an issue, so I didn't complain. The dish came out dry with a one ounce (think half a shot glass) side of cold Hollandaise sauce. I requested more, was given a bit larger portion, cold as well. I then asked for warm sauce and was told they don't heat it or it will curdle. This indicates it's not freshly made. Since when is cold hollandaise sauce the standard? Also, no WiFi and they charge $1.00 more per dish and item if you eat in.",

    "text": "In Edinburgh for the weekend and had no idea what to do... so what does every average person do when they have that problem? I found this cute and quint little place on Google. The reviews and ratings were good and everything here was locally sourced so count me in!  The place is small, it can be easily missed when walking to it. Also, so if you are trying to come here with a group larger than 2, you may have to wait but I think it would be worth it. The staff is genuinely cheery and very polite and kind. The inside is very homey with mixed matched tables, chairs and couches, but you really don't feel crowded in.   I had a latte and the breakfast panini. The coffee was awesome, not bitter, smooth and creamy, one of the best lattes I have had. I even took another one to go. The panini was delicious as well. Free range hard boiled egg sliced up, bacon, melted mozzarella and hollandaise. The hollandaise was the best part and made the sandwich.  Great little nook in Edinburgh, if I end up back here I will definitely come back. The only downsides are being small and busy, but if you aren't in a rush and want to enjoy a really awesome breakfast, definitely try this place.",

We tried their eggs royale, waffles, breakfast panini and, because it caught my eye in the fridge, spanikopita. This was served warm with dressed and seasoned salad. All food was very tasty, fresh and wonderfully hot.  Coffees and chai latte were good too and the service was excellent.  This cafe needs attention both outside and parts of the inside. But don't let that deter you from this solid breakfast spot.",

First off, there was an ungodly amount of bacon on there, at least 10 strips, no joking, for only 6.15. If I was back in the US, that would be $25 for sure. The bacon was incredible and the waffles were crispy and perfect. 11/10 would recommend.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for Papii but left feeling disappointed.   I wanted a quick smoothie for my afternoon walk home. The guy on the till was on a trial shift so couldn't put through my sale without supervision. The lady on the shift with him saw me but carried out a few tasks, whilst I waited for her to take my order. I waited a few minutes, feeling like a bit of a lemon for doing so.  So, I'd ordered my smoothie. It was relatively quiet and I could see plenty of staff in the kitchen. I waited about ten minutes, often catching glimpses into the back to see staff joking around. - By the time my smoothie came, I wasn't too sure whether I wanted one anymore!  Finally, smoothie in hand, I thanked the lady and said goodbye. She turned sharply away from me to talk to her colleague, with no thank you or goodbye. And no apology for the wait. Service wise, I'd expected better.  I sipped the smoothie on my way home. It was berries and orange juice with coconut puree; the flavours didn't go well together. It was sour and the coconut puree also made it overly sweet. I'm working part time hours at the moment and a little strapped for cash so I regretted not saving the pennies and waiting till I'd gotten home to make my own. - Foodie regret is such an awful feeling! Unfortunately, Papii disappointed me with both its service and its smoothie.",

Yet another wonderful Elite suggested find, this time courtesy of the lovely Caz H. This tiny little place packs a surprising punch. It's all of six tables - which you will acutely feel on the weekend while you table scavenge with the ten other people looking to feed themselves. Expect to be squeezed in, table poached or on the rare occasion, exiled to the outside seats if you venture here on a weekend.  Why? Because you've made an excellent decision - they serve up a delightful breakfast. All. Freaking. Day.  Because i'm addicted, I had to go with a benny option, though the waffles here look pretty killer as well. Opted for a Eggs Royale (smoked salmon benny) and it was darn tasty. Alongside not one, but two coffees (you know it's good when this rare coffee consumer orders a second), it was a lovely little brunch for a decent price.  I had been in here once previously for a smoothie. Honestly, they aren't my favourite but I come from the land of smack-you-in-the-face-green-health-smoothies, so it was just too sweet for my likely. That being said, in the city, they're second only to Hula in this category. If you are a far less picky guy/gal and like a sweet fruit drink - this is likely a good option.  All in all, another lovely little find for my Sunday afternoons. Thanks Caz!",
