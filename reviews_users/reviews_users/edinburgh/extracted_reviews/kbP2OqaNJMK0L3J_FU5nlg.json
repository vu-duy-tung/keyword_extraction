    "text": "October 2014: Stumbled upon George Street Bar and Grill one eve while we were walking about.  We couldn't decide what sounded the best as we read through all of the other restaurant menus.  George Street had lots of options that we decided to give it a go. So glad we did.  I have a small olive problem.  I love them and I want them constantly and at every restaurant or bar I go into if I see them on the menu.  These olives were addicting.  They were in a tomato-y garlic infused oil well that's my guess.  They were amazing.  We ordered them three times. We ordered risotto for me and filet for him.  The risotto was overcooked but flavourful.  They realised I wasn't a fan so they took it back.  I was happy with the salad I ordered and the olives.  I pinched several of his scallops too.  He was over the moon about his filet.  Couldn't stop chewing and making \"oh my God\" faces.  Pretty hilarious. Our meal was accompanied by prosecco and world class service.  Our servers were extremely attentive and helpful even when the dinner rush arrived. We enjoyed every bit of our 3 hour dinner as did our table neighbours. Can't wait to partake of the lush food and service again soon, George Street!.",

    "text": "A lot of people don't actually know that there  is a large outdoor area in between the bar and hotel which is good for summertime.  I sat at the bar area which is usually not too overcrowded.  The waiters were very polite and attentive.   I ordered the liver, mushroom and bacon as starter.  Delicately and perfectly cooked liver. Most of livers I have tried are just overcooked.    My main dish was lamb cutlet.  Lamb is usually cooked medium / pink but I think this time they have overcooked it slightly.  The crust was also not as flavourful as some of the lamb cutler I have tried.  However, the beans and potatoes that came with it were perfectly cooked and flavourful.   My dessert was the rice pudding.  I think the ingredients were excellent when paired with the mandarin oranges.  The way they prepare the rice pudding was like creme brulee with melted sugar at the top of the moulded rice pudding. However, the rice was on a slightly on the dryer and harder texture.  Can't really fault this place much but maybe some improvement can be done to further enhance the quality of the food.  Wouldn't mind coming again to try the other food on their menu.",

    "text": "Our tour group leader uses the Roxburghe Hotel for his tours of the area. We had several meals in this restaurant. The breakfast selection were very good and there was plenty of it. The service was prompt and probably exceeds most hotel run restaurants. Overall, a good place to be while touring the city.",

    "text": "Went to the George Street Bar and Grill to celebrate with my boyfriend. Booking online was easy. He got a steak and I got the Sunday roast dinner. I don't think he was very impressed with the shrimp and scallop skewer he added on, and seemed disappointed his chips were just average (though, I don't know why he wanted chips when they had other side options). However, my roast dinner was perfection. Everything on my plate was cooked expertly and the portion size was just right.  I also appreciated that they offer mocktails, as I do not drink alcohol. I had one that was a very tasty mix of perfectly ripened fruits such as strawberry and kiwi with lemonade. I definitely plan on coming back for drinks on the sidewalk seating, if not for Sunday dinner again. It was a lovely evening.   The only thing that I was not 100% on was the decor. It was a little plain/random and not in a chic minimalist kind of way. Still nice in the old building, though. There were stairs/a lift down to the restrooms.",

They were short handed and had didn't have many of the things on the menu. The roof was leaking next to our table which kept splashing us. All together a disaster save for one redeeming factor. A great Cosmopolitan!",

    "text": "I enjoyed my visit to the George Street Bar & Grill, the revamped restaurant in the Roxburghe Hotel, which opened in August 2013.  I had good French onion soup, followed by tasty beef cheeks. It has a good opportunity to establish itself as a reliable favourite, but  there are a few places nearby that are ploughing a similar furrow with considerable expertise, so they need to get very good, very quickly to compete.  So overall, we said: \"the George Street Bar & Grill shows signs of promise. They have some good value lunch a pre-theatre options, which will lure people in to give it a try. Its problem is that it's bounded by Hadrian's and Galvin's, and has the Bonham, nearby. These are all hotel restaurants that are serving grub to a considerably more impressive standard. If you find yourself at the Grill, you'll be pleased enough, but not completely bowled-over, so I think they have a little work to do to sharpen things up.\"",
