    "text": "Henri must be one of Edinburgh's most deceptively large businesses, for sure. I've walked past many a time only to peek in to see this teeny, weeny cafe. All is not what it seems. When I finally ventured in, I was wide eyed in amazement at the sheer size of the place. There's a service counter at the front topped with freshly baked treats and lots of foodie goodies dotted all over the place, many from local spots. There's also a second counter at the back and more seating too. - Lovely and spacious.   The first thing that struck me was the smell of cooking; a herby, meaty one; an omen of the good food to come. Our wait for food - although relatively short - was an impatient one as we watched platefuls of delicious food make their way to tables which weren't ours. When my baked eggs arrived, I was truly spoilt. A large portion of tomato, spicy, egg-topped goodness with bread for dunking on the side. The chorizo in this dish was like none I've tried before. - It literally melted in my mouth and the paprika flavour was so intense. This was a top class baked eggs. If I had any grumbles, they'd be: 1) a little bit more chorizo throughout the dish and 2) the eggs could have been a little runnier. Although, baked eggs are new to me, and I have to say Henri's are the best I've tried in Edinburgh so far.   This is one spot I'll keep in mind for those lazy brunch-filled Sundays.",

Inside it is very roomy, pretty, (decorated with lots of nice flowers) & appeared to be a decent place for coffee and cake. I had a hot chocolate & some carrot cake which were both strong and flavourful - had me feeling pleasantly full afterwards. My mum said her latte was one of the best she'd ever had! Would definitely come here again.",

    "text": "\"There's a big cafe in there!\"  This sign often graces the front of Henri's and folks, it's True: there's a big, friendly cafe in there! In fact, if it's your first time in the door, it will surprise you how much stuff sits behind their simple exterior.  There's a little coffee bar surrounded by ample seating. They brew great coffee and it's a quiet place to work.  There's a deli counter with super nice folks who will talk your ear off about cheese.   There's cheese!  There are shelves of fresh baked bread tucked next to a cooler with great local goodies.  There's often fresh garlic hanging near the window.  But most importantly, when you combine all those together and then pop yourself at one of the best people watching front windows in Stockbridge, you my friends have the perfect lunch/coffee combo afternoon.",

    "text": "One of my favourite places in Stockbridge, I'll usually be sighted with friends having a lazy Sunday afternoon consuming meat, cheese and wine (I am actually here every Sunday afternoon, its quickly become a tradition).  The owner, Simon, who we have dubbed 'the wine guy' has a great knowledge of wines and will usually provide us with suggestions to compliment our meal. I also love that the prices of the wine do not have a ridiculous mark up- you just pay corkage if having the wine in store.   My recommendation is the meat and cheese board (large, of course). This should feed 2-3 people. The cheeses and meat vary week to week and will be explained to you upon serving.   The menu changes quite regularly but if you see the roast vegerable tagine on them menu, get it- its absolutely delicious! The desserts and coffee are lovely too, particularly the chocolate tart and chocolate brownie.  I usually go to Simon for suggestions for all my wine needs and he has never steered me wrong. He also has an amazing memory and can recall which when I've had with my friends and how long ago I enjoyed it.  This place has a lovely atmosphere and great staff. I couldn't think of a better place to get my wine and cheese fix on a Sunday afternoon.",

Both I cannot fault.

No matter your ethics on the subject there are also one of the only purveyors of fois gras in the city, on nom nom.  Great place for a chilled Sunday :)",

    "text": "Formerly Peckham & Rye, Henri's opened here in June 2011 after Peckhams went in to administration. There was a public (and by public I mean social media) out pouring of grief at the closure of its stores around Edinburgh. This place has big shoes to fill...  My visit recently, on a not so sunny or warm day, was fueled by necessity. Jenny. L, Claire. C and I needed somewhere to eat after a laborious day trawling through the charity shops in Stockbridge. With all of us having various different plans for social activities that evening, and the fact that it was now far too late for our meal to be considered lunch, we needed somewhere that could provide us with both light snacks and more substantial meals. As none of us had been to Henri's before we decided to give it a go, as always relishing the opportunity to write a Yelp review for somewhere new.  Henri's is comprised of a deli at the front of the store and a cafe to the rear, which was warm and inviting after being out in the cold. The place was packed (always a good sign) even though we were looking for a table well after 2pm. Our waitress very kindly managed to squeeze us around a table so we weren't kept waiting long.   Naturally on a cold day everyone ordered tea, which was served loose leaf in brightly coloured tea pots, which I think can be bought from the store. (They were on shelves in the deli but unpriced so I have no idea how much the cost.) Cheese features heavily on the menu which severely limited my menu choices having a lactose intolerant diet. Ordering something was made all the more dangerous due to the menu being in French. With a little guidance from our waitress I decided on rillettes pur canard with toasted bread. The rillettes was mouthwatering, incredibly smooth and not terribly fatty as some pates can be.  The staff were really accommodating and friendly and whilst the menu was a little on the pricy side it's a nice place to go as an occasional treat.  Future reviewers! Find out how much the tea pots cost!",

    "text": "Replacing the old Peckham's (which I'd avoided ever since the food-poisoning incident of 2007), Henri's is a natural addition to the foodie paradise that is Stockbridge. Unlike the Morningside branch, Raeburn Place gives priority to the cafe facilities and does so very well. It is on the pricey side, but the sort of pricey one doesn't mind paying The coffee is excellent, the bread delicious. Everything is presented well and served with charm and professionalism.  I love browsing the food shelves but have never felt the urge to buy anything, however I am slowly working my way through the food and drinks menu.",

When I lived in Stockbridge it was generally a weekly visit to Henri's for coffee (their cappuccino with the little chocolate sprinkles is some of the best coffee in Edinburgh) or for a mixed charcuterie or cheese platter and a fine glass of wine.  Its a great place equally for a catch up with friends of a light lunch with mum.  The only thing stopping 5 stars is it can be on the pricey side but I'm happy to pay for the quality.",

    "text": "Located where Peckhams used to be, Henri is a French deli and cafe in Stockbridge, perfectly located for a stop during some charity shop shopping or after a wander in the Botanics and Inverleith Park, or even after a browse around the Modern Art Galleries. The coffee is very good, and I had only gone for coffee until recently. But after a wander up the Galleries the other day we had cheeky stop for coffee and got tempted by a platter of charcuterie and cheese.  We ordered a small size one, which was plenty for 2 for a late afternoon snack.  Different kinds of yummy cheese, and some saucisson, and ham, accompanied by a couple of olives and cornichons. Gorgeous! The deli counter has an extensive selection of French cheese, and if you like your smelly cheese, it is the place to go! They do bread and viennoiseries, which I hear are good. The shop also has an selection of French delicacies, from nougat to cassoulet. They also sell wines and other alcoholic drinks, which are a bit overpriced, but can be nice as a present. Being French myself, I find the shop expensive, but it is fabulous to make presents to a foodie friend or as a little occasional treat.  The cafe is however reasonably priced and the staff are very friendly.  I can only recommend the place.",
