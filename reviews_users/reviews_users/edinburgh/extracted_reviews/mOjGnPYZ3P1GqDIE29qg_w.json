For my main, I had the sea bass which was perfectly cooked, and came with asparagus and potatoes. Would recommend to anyone seeking out a fabulous meal!",

    "text": "Stopped in while walking around town. I got there right when they opened for lunch and I had the entire restaurant to myself. They do everything by courses, so you pick 1, 2, or 3 courses and it is set pricing. I did a two course off the wee menu, which she told me was smaller portions. For 16 pounds, I got a carrot and ginger soup, which was delicious. I ordered the pork shoulder with mushroom risotto, which was also very good.   The waitress I had was very friendly and helpful. It is a small spot with good character. The one downside is no WiFi, so as a traveler, just be prepared for that.   I'd definitely recommend it for a nice relaxing lunch spot.",

I didn't want to eat too much as heading off to the military tattoo after and it was perfect portion size, yet very tasty. Paired with a nice South African Cabernet, my meal was set! Lovely and attentive staff and service! This restaurant was recommended to me by a colleague from London. I would definitely recommend to anyone stopping in to see Edinburgh!!",

    "text": "Had an early steak dinner here on a voucher. I was really looking forward to it as had a fantastic dinner at their restaurant in North Queensferry a while back and was expecting the same quality of food and service that has them in the Michelin Guide.  Steaks were fantastic and cooked to perfection. We decided to try desserts and while I enjoyed my posset, I'm not sure it warranted the 7 pound price tag & my companion did not enjoy the bannofee which was a special on the day.  What I was most disappointed by was the service, it was friendly, but lacked the fineness I'd come to expect from The Wee Restaurant.  We each ordered wine and my companion's glass was literally dripping when it got to the table. This then left a puddle on the table and was almost impossible to drink from without either dripping on the food or your lap.   No complaints from me about the food, but for the price of their a la carte menu, I'd expect a higher level service.",

    "text": "+ Excellent, really excellent food. Local flavours cooked imaginatively and with skill. Scallops were done to the turn, my sea bass was juicy but with crisp skin, and the cheese platter with several different kinds of home-made (!) biscuits was as good as I've ever had. I would however have preferred a slightly larger portion of fish. + Service very very friendly but lacking the finesse I expect at these prices.  The overall experience was excellent. The criticisms I have listed pale into insignificance compared with the good things.",
