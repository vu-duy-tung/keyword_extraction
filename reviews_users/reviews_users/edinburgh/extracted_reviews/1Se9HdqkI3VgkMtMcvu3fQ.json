    "text": "Sometimes when I close my eyes and try to picture heaven, I find myself sitting on a cloud with a Che shawarma, sipping on my free coke. The older man with the killer beard - working in there - cooks with the same kind of passion that usually earns Michelin stars. He would literally become a shawarma if it was socially acceptable. He would adopt a kebab, he would call his first born garlic sauce. He somehow makes communism cool through the power of his shamwawa. My life hasn't been the same since I discovered this place. Literally he is the Kanyewest of shawarmas. Thank you for so much, I owe you so much more than you will ever know.  I Love this place   it's all about the food here. Forget the interior design. Just eat and enjoy!  It's the best shawarma place in the world! (And I travel a lot)   It's THE PLACE I return to every time I'm in Edinburgh",

I ordered a lamb shawerma, the guy next to me ordered chicken. Honestly I had food envy when they came out. The lamb it quite thickly sliced and not the best flavour in my opinion. I prefer thin, but that's just me. They add pickles too which was a nice surprise! Also..don't be fooled by the picture on the front of the store..my kebab was waaaaaay bigger!!! It was freaking huge!! I was starving so stupidly ordered a meal with chips and a drink (7, 5.50 not in a meal). The chips were good. He offered whatever sauce I wanted in the side for free. What a legend. All in all, would go back :)",

I am a regular here every week and all the gentlemen who work there know exactly what I want. The lamb and chicken shawarmas are perfect to accompany a nice ice cold pint at home if you do take away which I do. I am sure all the other wraps and falafels and whatnot are just as amazing as the shawarmas. I recommend this place to all the college kids who live around the area of frequent the pubs around the area. You get a student discount and one shawarma will fill you up for the whole day saving your wallet.",

I should also probably note that I was a little, um, \"under the influence\" whenever I went to Che. NONETHELESS, it's still a great late night kebab place.  Also, it's a Che Guevara-themed kebab shop in Scotland. If that doesn't entice you, I don't know what else will.",

It seems to be holding its own at the moment and for good reason. The food here is the epitome of cheap and cheerful. They aren't winning any prizes for originality but they serve all the staples you need from a takeaway at really good prices.   Chips 1.50  Pizza 3.50  Wraps 4.50  Burgers 3.50   The guys who work here are friendly and chatty and while it might not win prizes for food originality it's a pretty original name for a takeaway. Che Guevara's face adorns the sign outside and there is a timeline of photos on the red walls inside.I have no idea what the reason behind it was but if you have always wanted to get chips from a communist takeaway this is the place for you!",

One of the afore mentioned wraps is a whole pile of food 3.80 at the moment for a monster wrap and chips. I dont eat chips so cannot comment on those, my friends normally fall heir to those. The staff and owner are always friendly and place is as you would expect from a late night kebab joint I guess... clean and functional.  Items other than the falafel I have tried:  - they do some really nice Palestinian tea, well work a try - the pizzas were nice  - salad boxes are great and really good value - my friends seem to really enjoy the kebabs here. Tried a bit once here and it was good, but I am not really down with that shaved elephant leg stuff to be honest.  No idea why it is called Che, but I am now going to ask the owner the next time i see him.",

    "text": "Why this place is called Che Takeaway I just don' t know. Maybe the owners are Cuban. Maybe they genuinely do respect the Argentinian revolutionary so much that  when they opened their (fairly new) takeaway they had one man they just had to honour. Or maybe this is the last step in a long road of a highly ironic exploitation of Guevara's famous image, for the purpose of selling stuff.  Icons sell, even icons of left wing guerrilla fighters.  Anyway you will find some more Che imagery inside, besides that this place just sells pizzas and chips. It's all pretty cheap and standard, certainly not terrible. At over 4 the wraps are a bit expensive but expect to pay less for everything else. The staff are find and overall the place isn't bad.  I don't imagine while Che fought his last battle in the Bolivian jungle he ever imagined his face would go on to sell greasy burgers. Other than his face and a time line of his life inside, there isn't really anything about what this takeaway that pertains to Che . The food isn't Cuban, or Argentinian, it certainly isn't revolutionary.",

    "text": "I can't make the connection to Che and food, and this place certainly ain't selling traditional Cuban cuisine. Nevertheless, it's a perfectly amiable little takeaway if you're looking for some quick grub before uni or work.  Selling cheap pizzas, panini's and some hot and cold drinks, it's more affordable than some of the takeaways littered around this area. There are some student deals available - if my memory serves me right students either get 10% off at lunchtime or a free cup of tea when they buy a meal. Perhaps someone should clarify that but I do distinctively remember being gutted I was no longer a student when I was ordering some late lunch out of here.  Food is pleasant enough.To be honest I thought this place looked a wee bit tacky from the exterior, but the food is of a better quality than I expected. Staff are friendly, and if you can get past the fact that pictures of Che loom over you as you place your order it's perfectly decent!",

    "text": "I feel I've seen what others haven't about Che's: the answer to \"Why is it called Che's?\". \"It's the Argentinian food?\" No, it's not.. \"It's a revolutionary attitude?\" No. No, it's not. \"Erm... an overwhelming enforcing of Marxism?\" Perhaps, I didn't ask. \"Christ, what then?! ...an undeserved student following?\" Got it in one!..    On a corner at the top of Forrest Road, Che's has around 3 or 4 different drinking roads from which you can stumble into its doorway, which probably largely explains its success. Neither cheap nor expensive nor amazing nor terrible, Che's fills a necessary niche for people, sober or otherwise, who happen to stumble past whilst in the grasp of hunger, inebriation, or preferably both.  It's roomy enough and the staff are pleasant; and the menu is fine, as are the prices. The advertised 10% student discount is much appreciated, if only to watch the chap's face age 20 years as he tries to deduct 10% from 13.47.  Why go here? Why not? You'd love it if you like visiting takeaways named after t-shirts, and it'd also be perfectly fine if you're simply passing. Why it's apt to name a takeaway after a criminal (responsible for the ruthless, untrialled murder of hundreds of people - look it up and bin your t-shirt) though, I'm not sure, but, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to found Ian Huntley's Sweets and Baths Shop.
