    "text": "A wee weekend in Edinburgh so I looked online for some deals,  found one for Merchants. Two courses for two with a glass of House wine each 29.00 that's Friday's Dinner sorted. We arrived for our 19.30 booking to an almost empty Restaurant there was one couple in it. The Decor was really lovely and the staff welcoming.  We ordered our wine wee cuz had to have white as they did not offer Rose on the deal.  The menu had great choices wee cuz had Quail for starters and Breast of Duck for Main. I had Salmon fishcake and then Lamb Shank. The food was beautifully presented and was delicious.  We had throughout Dinner had ordered another three glasses of wine.  We asked for the bill and as I had paid for the voucher the bill should just have been for the wine,  but no the proprietor wanted me to pay 29.00 + 15.00 + a 10% service charge. Now when we had arrived wee cuz had noticed that the couple who were there were not happy with their bill.  After much discussion I gave him  20.00 and left with no goodbyes or here is your coat.  It was such a pity if you do not want to over deals then don't but please do not try to fleece folks.  This Restaurant had six Customers on a Friday night the food was delicious but I will not recommend it to anyone.",

    "text": "This is the second time we've headed here for our work Christmas lunch and both times it's been a good experience. Hidden down Merchants St. I honestly never even noticed the place before but now the red exterior catches my eye every time.  Large groups seem to be their specialty.  This year I went with a duck salad with lime and chili, to start. It was tasty, though the duck was strange as it was cold (my mistake though, I was expecting warm) and smoked which was nice but a bit of a shock on first bite.   I had a lamb shank for mains, it was delicious! Very soft and almost at the 'falling the bone' stage, though not quite there. I was impressed that with nearly 50 people all being served at once it was still pretty darn good!  For desert I went (shock horror) for pudding and custard which was fairly generic and most likely from a pack, the custard was bland.   After we were served tea, coffee, toffees, clementines and mince pies on the house. They were on the menu for 2  so we were alright with that. Some of the clementines were 'too ripe' as in they were squishy and brown which I wasn't happy with.  The staff are lovely, I'm sure we weren't the first Christmas party in there this week and we definitely weren't the last before Christmas so I imagine they were pretty stressed but were still on-the-ball!   For Christmas lunch for 50 drunk, happy scientists it was just the ticket. It's a good menu and at a decent price. Compared to some of the great lunch/dinner places in Edinburgh though it's not quite up there so it's a three-star-review from this girl.",

    "text": "Whether it's al a carte or a large group or tour booking you're looking to satisfy, Merchants will meet most expectations.   A popular destination for large international tour bookings, the restaurant can be a little on the crowded side for lunch times.   However, if you're looking for a good selection of fine meals, dining in a warm atmosphere, Merchants delivers. It's a bit tucked away (to the left of Oz Bar and across from Drop Kick Murphy's pub) but once lit up at night, you can't miss it really.   The menu definitely has a French flair to it but you will find something to suit all tastes. Hats off to the chefs.",
