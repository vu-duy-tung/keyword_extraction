I got the onion and cheese pie and I have to say the puff pastry was beautifully cooked through so that all the layers were crispy and crunchy. Filling was delicious. You get a choice of how your peas are done and I went with classic mashed. Please note that service may take awhile especially between ordering and getting your food, but execution I think was spot on.",

    "text": "I've been eyeballing Auld Jock's Pie Shoppe since moving to Edinburgh. Whereas some folks (my husband) would insist \"tourist trap!\" I myself say \"Can we, please??\"  I managed to convinced the skeptic in question to join me on a sunny evening about town. Although we initially wanted to purchase a takeaway vegetable pie for the decent price of 2.50, when the friendly gal behind the counter inquired if I would like mashed potatoes and gravy with it, the Southern in me couldn't resist. We ended up sitting in to enjoy our treat (the ball and chain shook his head as to how I thought I would manage eating messy tatties and gravy on the go--a valid point!).  As a girl who's not accustomed to savory pies (we just don't really do them in the States), I think our mozzarella and spinach pie was just lovely, the perfect snack for a venture on the town. And while the mashed taters were nothing life-changing, the whole thing was a decent meal split between the two of us. Not only that, but the interior of the joint is charmingly fashioned out of big, sleek slabs of wood for the tables and chairs. The menu, as well, was surprisingly all-encompassing!  So why the three stars? Well, as much as I enjoyed my pie and the experience of sitting down for a snack in a wee \"Pie Shoppe,\" I do feel as though you could get a more authentic pie for the same price or better at other establishments--especially when you're so close to so many goodies along Bow Road and Grassmarket. That doesn't mean this place isn't cute and yummy, far from it. Really, I'd round up to 3.5 because I found it adorably quaint.  If you're looking for a pie in a pinch, I'd give Auld Jock's a go!",

    "text": "In all his pie shops Aul Jock offers excellent food and service, but his prices are just too high to take seriously if you live locally.  All the shops are located in touristy sort of areas like the Grasmarket where plenty of people on holiday are attracted by its vernacular name.   I've been in twice for lunch and both times there was a huge range of tasty looking food on offer.  There pies are all delicious and I particularly recommend the haggis as well as the mince and onion.  They also sell haggis with chips which is probably the best haggis I've tasted and was served in a big, filling portion.  It all feels very Scottish inside and staff are friendly and patient with the flocks of tourists. As said, it's just too expensive with most modest lunches costing in excess of 3.50.  It all tasty, but there's cheaper places nearby where you can also get great food.",

    "text": "A hot pie with mashed potato and gravy doesn't really go far wrong on a wintery day and so in that sense I can't fault Auld Jock's Pie Shoppe. The price is comparable to having a pie and chips, and at least here the pie isn't deep fried... However as a local the touristy, fake scottish name irks me a bit.   Aside to my issues with the name some, if not all of the pies are almost certainly bought in (I recognised the steak pie), nothing wrong with that but if you call yourself a pie shop, well perhaps preparing pies rather than just baking pies on premises wouldn't be a bad plan. The mash is also of the pre-prepared kind, good quality but not exactly authentic and the gravy well ah Bisto wouldn't be far from the truth.  The point I'm getting at is while the food is good (A-OK), there is a part of me that finds the inauthenticity of setup somewhat jarring...",

Despite its cheap prices, it would be nice to have a healthier, better quality pie and pastry shop to acquire lunch or a snack. Auld Jock's Pie Shoppe isn't that shop.  The pie I had wasn't really very good at all (there wasn't much choice for vegetarians) and, seemingly like the other reviewers, I wasn't impressed by the prices. To top it off it came across as being very touristy and was packed when I went in. Perhaps I just got unlucky but paying so much for this type of food was offputting, especially when you consider the other options nearby, especially around Newington.  There's room for improvement Auld Jocke!",

The pies/pastries are all ok, but nothing special. I can't help but feel like I'm paying for the novelty name and the touristy location when I buy their steeply priced fare.  I hate to admit it, but I'd rather go to Greggs.",
