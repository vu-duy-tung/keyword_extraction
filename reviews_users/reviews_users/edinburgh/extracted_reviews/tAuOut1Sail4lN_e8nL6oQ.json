    "text": "Outstanding tour! I joined the Old and New Town tour yesterday, and it was a great way to spend part of my first day in Edinburgh. We visited five restaurants, three of which I would not have found/visited on my own. The food at each was well chosen, and there wasn't a single place I wouldn't return to for seconds. :)   Our guide (I believe his name was Ian), was well informed and made sure to include lots of information that wasn't food-oriented. He took us around the Greyfriar's cemetary, up the beautiful Victoria St, and down through a close near the Writer's Museum. When the tour was over, he also helped guide me back to where I needed to be, which I really appreciated as I wasn't too familiar with the city yet.   The other three people on the tour were actually Edinburgh residents, and remarked repeatedly how much they'd enjoyed the day, and that Eat Walk Edinburgh had shown them places they didn't know about despite living here for decades. That sure does speak well for the tour!",

    "text": "This tour was amazing! I did both the lunch and dinner tours and not only did I get to try different foods on each, but the sights you get to see were different as well! My two favorite things were skillfully combined, trying new food and learning about a city's history.  Alan was a great tour guide with interesting anecdotes and made sure each tour member felt included. His other tour guide was equally good.  After each tour, I returned to a few of the places they took us and loved them! I hope everyone tries out this great experience!",
