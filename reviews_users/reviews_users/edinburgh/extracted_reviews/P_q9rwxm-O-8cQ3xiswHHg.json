    "text": "Time 4 Thai is a very decent Thai cuisine experience, in modern surroundings, and is also very conveniently located right in the centre of town, just off George Street, so you don't have to go far for your Thai fix if you've been loitering around the city centre shops.  The staff were very friendly and accommodating on my first visit here, and actually, at the time, pre visit to Thailand and consequential love for Thai food, I wasn't really that au fait with Thai cuisine at all. The eternally smiley waitress duly recommended what we should sample, so we ended up with quite a few different dishes, through wanted to try lots of different things, but also, mostly, because I generally have eyes bigger than my stomach. The Tom Kha seafood soup went down a treat, love it, and the Phar Goong king prawn salad was also tasty.   The specialism here is seafood, although there are several other options, and depending on what time of day you're in, you can choose from a 3 course lunch, business lunch, order from the a la carte menu or share one of the Thai banquet set menus. The interior of the restaurant is polished and immaculate to a tea, so this is very tasty Thai food, in an equally as delightful setting.",

    "text": "Time for Thai on North Castle Street is a recent discovery and has definitely become a firm favourite. It is one of the first Thai restaurants I've eaten in in Edinburgh where the food actually tastes like it does in Thailand.   The restaurant is decorated in a traditional Thai style, but also manages to feel modern and airy with lots of light. The staff in Time For Thai are fantastic and very very helpful, they were so attentive it was like being back in Thailand rather than wintry Scotland!   The first time we went was on a Saturday for lunch when they had the option of a 10 three course set menu or a four course menu for a little more. We opted for the 4 course menu which was fantastic! The second time we went, we had food off the a la carte menu, which was as good as what we ate on the set menu.   All the food is presented in a beautiful fashion and tasted amazing!",

Not that I've been to Thailand to speak from real experience but it convinced me.   The service was impeccable. Understated but incredibly efficient. The food was brought to our table incredibly speedily and the waiters did a great job of hovering unobtrusively to top up wine glasses and clear plates and the like.   The food was delicious. A good menu which appeared to satisfy both carnivores and vegetarians in the party. I had the most exquisitely presented prawn starter and then a vegetable curry which were both delicately spiced and deliciously flavoursome. My only tiny criticism would be targeted at the mango icecream but the coconut made up for it and as I managed to con my boss into swapping half of each, it didn't matter all that much.   Nice wine list too. We had a very fine chardonnay voignier if I remember rightly. Crisp and delicious.   I would rush back here.",

Being a huge fan of Thai cuisine I have been to quite a few restaurants in and around Edinburgh and believe Time for Thai to be not only the best food, but servive and surroundings score 10 out of 10 too. It is not even ridiculously over-priced, not cheap but reasonable for the quality you get. If you like thai, check it out!",

Thai crisps and dips were brought out and drinks too straight away and we didnt wait long on the food which was exquisite. It has a very calming ambiance with nice thai plants and rich colours and all the staff dress traditionally. The only downside to this place I would say is price as when you order your main you have to buy rice etc seperately which made it quite expensive, with a beer and a glass of wine my meal came to about 30 which I thought was a bit steep but a lovely place for a treat.",

We got some (Moo Thod Takrai Grob) Deed fried shredded pork neck with crispy lemongrass served with Tamarind sauce and some Sei-Klong Moo BBQ (Roasted pork spare ribs marinated with Asian spices,honey and BBQ sauce) for appetizers. Main course were a bit of Grilled Thai style BBQ chicken with traditional Thai papaya salad and spicy ground chilli sauce and some Phad Gra Prow ( Traditional stir fried dish with crushed fresh chilli,garlic,mushrooms,fine beans,bell peppers and Thai holy basil leaves with beef). Desserts were ice cream. All tasted absolutely amazing but we think it was quite pricey because the portion was quite small.   Would definitely come back tho because of the delicious taste of their food!",

Presentation was very nice. Fish cakes were a little rubbery but overall pretty tasty. Pad Thai was really good. I had the veggie one and it could have used a few more greens but the ones that were there were great. Although, this may just be because I'm not a big person, but the Pad Thai portion was too big for me and I was unable to finish it. I don't think I'd say this is the best Thai food I've ever had but it certainly wasn't bad.",

We found the reviews on Yelp encouraging, so we were expecting to be wowed with authenticity and flavours.  Unfortunately we were slightly disappointed. The flavours were missing (or perhaps too delicate) on the majority of dishes we ordered. Even my Tom Yum needed some kick.  My duck in dry red curry sauce, was billed as 'spicy' - but it was anything but. Sure enough they used fresh chili in the dishes that needed it, but to get some heat I needed to bite out the seeds and even bargain for some from the wife (in exchange for some meat)   The service is very friendly, efficient and helpful. Nothing wrong with that. I just wished we had a little more of what we were expecting from a Thai meal.",

That's when it went down hill we ordered the banquet meal, within 5 minutes of ordering the starter was there it was average nothing special, before we had finished that the next course came salad it was disgusting it looked like pre packed chicken with ice berg lettuce and smothered in fish sauce I could eat it. Then we had the main meal which was quite nice we had monk fish curry and a masaman curry with rice very tasty.  They never came over and asked how are meal was and I felt really rushed like they didn't want us there.

The food was absolutely amazing, each course perfectly filling and deliciously tasty. We got a mixed platter to share for starters, which had fried pork, fish cakes, prawn & noodle sushi roll amongst other things equally delicious that I can't recall. For mains there was a varied choice around the table, from the traditional Thai red & green chicken curries, the extra spicy jungle curry; to the grilled duck & pepper dishes of the 'C' section of the menu (C4 I believe ...) No desserts were consumed due to the amount of food already had ... Service was top notch, and the atmosphere was second to none. It was beautiful. Thank you!",

Don't get me wrong, it's just off George Street and so you'd expect any restaurant in this neck of the woods to be in a certain price range, but over 40 a head for dinner did seem a bit excessive. But then they brought out their Express Business Lunch menu, and by contrast this is one of the best value lunch menus that I know of in the city centre. At only 9.50 a head, you really can't go wrong. I had the marinated chicken and sweetcorn fritters to start, followed by the deep fried salmon in dry red curry for my main, and by the time they brought us our ice cream for desserts I was too full to finish mine!

They couldn't do enough for us and its nice to be served by such polite people.   For starters I had the Chicken Satay. Not very adventurous I know, but it was delicious. The best I have ever had, by miles. For my main course, I had the Thai Green Curry which was out of this world. Who knew food could be so fresh and delicious? The flavours are just amazing.   After telling my mum about this place she insisted on taking me out to lunch here a few weeks later. I didn't complain! They do a lunch menu of three courses for 9.50 per person. At that price it is fantastic, there is a limited choice on the lunch menu but these set menus usually are.  Overall this restaurant is one of my favourite in Edinburgh. I absolutely love it.",

    "text": "The starters in Time 4 Thai were a couple of the most memorable dishes we've sampled on all of our quests. They were so packed with flavour that they were practically capable of blowing the roof off the place. Mains didn't quite (couldn't ever) live up to that firecracker start, but were solidly good. Well worth a visit, we'd say!  Overall, we said: \"I was served with memorable soup, in smart surroundings, with good, attendant service, and nicely presented dishes. These things are all very much to Time 4 Thai's credit...I think I'll be back to Time 4 Thai. There are lots of things on the menu that look tempting.\"",

    "text": "TIME 4 REVIEW  Impeccable service from as soon as you walk through their front door.  3 WAY COMBO! - Grapow beef - thai basil and chili beef (sliced beef which was ununsual as I am used to having this dish with minced beef in Australia ?!) - make sure you finish every last drop of the sauce, and avoid the chopped chili if that isn't your style :)  - Pad Thai with prawns - yummmmmm, don't forget to squeeze the lime all over  - Yellow duck curry - was brilliant, the sauce started off rather mild but after a few mouthfuls started to fire up! Yay! not too hot, though - and went superbly with rice ... all finished off with two serves of coconut rice.  Food servings were ample, with the above (and a bottle of red, of course) filling two tummies rather nicely.  Cannot stress how good service was, wait staff were friendly and responsive to our every need.  (QUESTION OF THE DAY: I saw that hot chips were also on the menu, what is it to do with Asian restaurants in Scotland serving chips?!)  I did take a pic of the food but my stupid phone seems to have eaten the pic. :( If someone buys me a bright new shiny iPhone 4S, I promise that it won't happen again.",

    "text": "How gorgeous is this restaurant!?  The decor is the absolute focal point for me, as the place is decked out in beautiful light woods and metals, highlighted with beautiful purple effects which make the place look fantastic inside.   Aside from the awful name (Time 4 Thai? really?) I wasn't too sure about eating here because of reviews I had heard regarding the extortionate prices. I was pleased when we just made it in time for the set lunch menu which was only 9.50 each.  After being seated, we ordered a couple of glasses of wine and got down to ordering. The 3 course lunch has quite a few varied choices, including a soup, marinated ribs and a couple of chicken options. I decided to go for the Thai spring rolls which were packed with delicious vegetables and crispy on the outside, served with a small salad and dipping sauce. Delicious.  After much deliberation, we both decided to go for stir fried chilli chicken with peppers, which was sooo hot! We had to ask for water to go with it, our mouths were burning! The other options looked tasty too, with beef, chicken, fish and vegetable choices to choose from. I was really impressed with the selection for such a small price! The desert was only ice-cream but by the time we were finished the main, we were stuffed! We decided to get the bill and leave it there, even though the waiter was pretty adamant we stayed to eat desert!  I would certainly come back again. I think the full price menu is expensive but I honestly think that the quality in here would make a special meal out worth the extra pennies!",

The restaurant was also packed, which I think is testament in itself for a Wednesday night.   Its a lovely modern restaurant although different to traditional Thai it creates a relaxing cheerful atmosphere.   The food was good value, for the quality. I'll definitely be back!!!",
