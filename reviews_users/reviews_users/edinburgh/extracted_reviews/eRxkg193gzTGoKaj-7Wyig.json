I thought they were all tapas size so ordered a second, chicken/mango sauce, but when the samosa arrived I was realising I would have to ask for piggy bag. The place it self could do with a renovation at places - water damaged wall paper hanging off one wall - didn't really fit the otherwise rather posh table setting and ambience. Staff is very friendly and food comes out fast and fresh. A nice wee Indian place.",

    "text": "Mezbaan is a sensational restaurant, serving authentic South Indian cuisine.   Situated in the Tollcross area of Edinburgh, Mezbaan is just a short walk from the city centre and so it is a convenient place to reach, and with the outside of the restaurant painted a lovely bright maroon colour, it would be difficult to miss it.   The Mezbaan menu offers a vast range of authentic South Indian dishes such as kebabs and dosa's (rich pancakes served with a filling). I came here for dinner several months ago with a friend and I had an absolutely beautiful meal. I had the mixed pakora's for a starter which were tasty, but my main course of Chili Beef was definitely something to write home about! The beef was cut into the tiniest slices and then fried along with peppers and onions in a chili sauce - yum! It was a pretty spicy meal, but definitely something that I would order again.   The prices for the meals in Mezbaan are quite reasonable considering it is in the Tollcross area. The starters are priced at around five pounds and the main courses are more expensive at about ten to fifteen pounds - but the food is definitely worth it!   Mezbaan also do takeaways and home deliveries which is incredibly handy so they get a big thumbs up from me!",

    "text": "The food is good, but the service isn't and the venue is unlikely to impress. Is the food good enough to compensate for the shortcomings? Probably just about, but it's more of a quick dosa lunch place than an evening meal spot.  Overall, we said: \"Mezbaan undoubtedly serves very tasty grub, but the overall restaurant experience feels a little odd. They definitely need to do something about the look of the place, as it feels unfinished. And given that the food they serve is likely to be at least somewhat unfamiliar to many of their customers, their service needs to be entirely more accurate and confident, as I won't be alone in seeking to rely upon recommendations from the waiters. Despite these shortcomings, I'd still recommend that you pay Mezbaan a visit, as their food is definitely worth the trip.\"",

    "text": "Sad to say I have to disagree with all the other reviewers about how great this place is.   the restaurant gets two points for the food but ive docked another because of my \"lost umbrella\" and ehh service.  We went to the restaurant and they told us to come back in 15 minutes because they dont have any seats open. Ok, so we go to the bar next door, grab a drink and come back in 20 minutes.  Still no seat available. By this time, I'm super hungry and about to fall over. But we wait.  Another 20 minutes pass and FINALLY we get seated.  We ordered the overpriced thali and the salmon tikka., tomato rice and naan.  Naan was fine, salmon tikka was horribly fishy.  Thali was okay but wayyy overpriced.  Its  essentially a hodgepodge of different curries.   I mean $15.95 for all that?  And the tomato rice, dont get me staretd on that.  It tasted liek someone dipped all the rice into a vat of butter and handed to me on a plate. I am married to a south indian so i know whats good.  That was NOT good.  Naan was the only thing that was okay in my opinion and I saked for dry naan but again no one seemed to listen.    The icing on the top was that we left our umbrella there and were clearly the last people in the restaurant. we call the restaurant to ask to pick it up and the guy said they didnt have it.  come on really? its only an umbrella.  Would i recommend to others? That would be ahem. NO.",

    "text": "Mezbaan often seem to be left out of favourite curry restaurant lists. It often seems to escape the limelight. This is undeserved.  Mezbaan is an Indian restaurant specialising in South Indian cuisine. Every curry dish I have had hear is scrumptious! i have heard one person complaining that the curry wasn't authentic South Indian. I can't really comment on this, but I can give the taste and presentation a thumbs up! And for me that's what a mattered.  Prices are pretty reasonable. I ate here with a friend, with two courses and it cost us around 25.  Also note that its BYOB. This shouldn't be a problem as being near Tollcross there are several supermarkets (and actually a small grocers right next door).",

Service was painfully slow and advance booking would have been better. Interiors were cramped and left a lot of scope for improvement.I will go there again, but only after calling beforehand.",
