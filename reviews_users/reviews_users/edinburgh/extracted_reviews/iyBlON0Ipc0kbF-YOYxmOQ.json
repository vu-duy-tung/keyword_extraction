    "text": "I bought a voucher from ITISON for afternoon tea for two and I went with my friend for a girls day out.    The table was reserved and I was nicely shown to my table where the tea menu and table was set.    They did a veggie version for me but there was no refinement and it all seemed a little clumsy and mushy fillings that we didn't finish.  The scones weren't very soft and the cupcake looked pretty but was tasteless. The picture makes it look really nice, but it didn't taste anywhere as nice as I hoped it would. The best bit was the gin cocktail that went with it and it was delicious.   We never got offered a top up of tea and we weren't asked how everything was and the table was never cleared by the time we left.  the gin cocktail was 5 star but the afternoon tea wasn't anything to rave about and I wouldn't go back for afternoon tea here but I would come back for a drink.",

    "text": "Fairly busy on a Saturday night which was a surprise.  Monboddo is part of the Hilton on Bread Street. Caz H had won dinner and drinks so we came along to consume her prize as it were.  They have a short cocktail list - many are gin based which I don't have an issue with and some with quirky ingredients. Caz had a Monboddo which was decent and I forget the name of mine - something Lord but it was tasty and included balsamic vinegar which gave it hints of ginger beer. We'd had a busy week so we stayed for one drink post dinner only, but could have been tempted for more had exhaustion not set in.  This is not an area I'm in often but if I was, I'd pop in again - cocktails priced around 7-8.50 and there is table service and comfy seats.",

Rather soulless on reflection though it has a few pieces of art to stimulate conversation. Not too warm at this time of year either with its large glass frontage & open passageway to the lobby of The Point hotel.   No complaints about the bar service and I've not been asked to drink up at the end of the night so politely for a long time (being in with hotel residents might have influenced that though). Pretty run of the mill selection of drinks on offer. pretty cool professionally graffitied gents toilets.",

    "text": "Was doing on a training course on Bread Street the other weekend so went for their 5 lunch deal on the Sunday.  The place was pretty much empty.  There was only one other table apart from us.  I ordered a mackerel panini and the soup of the day, which was minestrone.  We went there because we thought the service would be quick.  Well, as it happens, it wasn't.  I wondered for a moment if they had gone fishing or something because really, how long does it take to heat up 4 bowls of soup and make 4 sandwiches?  Eventually the food arrived.  Panini was dry as f*ck.  Soup was ah OK, but then how difficult is it to make minestrone?  All in all, not good value for money despite the cheap price. Next time we'll go somewhere else.",

    "text": "As a rule, I am not a fan of restaurants attached to hotels, such as Monboddos. My problem is that they have a captured clientele, so they often dont put much effort into what they serve. Thankfully, Monboddos also has a supply of non-guest customers which keeps them on thier feet.  As a bar, Monboddos is great, a huge range of drinks (including loads of whiskeys) and a relaxed lounge type vibe. Drinks arent cheap, but this didnt matter as when I ordered a G&T my favourate gin went in as standard, rather than a cheaper less tasty one.  The restaurant itself is modern and stylish, but has very little atmosphere - making meals feel uncomfortable and awkward. Staff are friendly, but appear to be so under pain of death - its that unnatural. Serving a range of medditeranian and sea food dishes, Monboddo certainly does well on the food front - the dishes are fresh and taste great, if slightly small and expensive.  Over all, the food and drinks at Monboddos are good, but atmosphere and price let it down greatly.",

    "text": "A recent favourite of mine over the last year, but then I like it for reasons which many wouldn't. Firstly as a hotel bar, they've got a comfortable steady customer flow which makes it easy to get served and find a table. The bar stock is superb, with excellent whiskies, wines and a higher standard house spirits than the average; not to mention some impressive high-end spirits.   The decor is unusual; black, silver and gold mixed well, not overpowering, and classy enough to make the place feel like somewhere special. The staff are friendly and professional, with some great original and exclusive cocktails served.",

As it is in the city centre it is a great place to stop in for one if you are on the move looking to drop into a few places in the one night. The drinks arent as cheap as other places in the area, but the more decent surroundings and the fact that its a hotel really mean you cant get too mad about this.",
