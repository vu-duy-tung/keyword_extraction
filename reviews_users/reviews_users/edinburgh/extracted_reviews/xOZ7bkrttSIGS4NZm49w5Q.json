    "text": "I've been here a couple of times recently, once for a pre-Picture House gig drink, and once to meet a friend for a girly catch up! A perfect venue for both!  The latest incarnation of this bar is my favourite of the past few years, and I hope to make it a regular feature on the list of places I like to go!  Tastefully done up...it kind of reminds me a cosier version of an American diner but that might just be to do with the black and white chequerboard floor! The tables are well spaced out (mostly!), and will accommodate varying sized groups to cosy meet-ups!  The menu isn't fancy, but is incredibly tasty, and they have a great 10 for two courses deal. They also do a litre carafe of wine for 8.50 (and it was a pretty drinkable wine too!). There's a massive array of beers on tap, which they change regularly for a bit of variety, and their cocktails were skillfully made (my chocolate martini was yummy!)  The only 'spoiler' here is the fact that when a gig is on upstairs in the HMV Picture House, the vibrations of the music were extremely noticeable when you were sitting up the back of the bar!  If you were out for a quiet drink it would be pretty annoying, you may need to think about moving to the front!  Oh....and if you're eating, I'd book a table! Apparently there are a lot of other folk that like Red Squirrel too!",

    "text": "I have been here a few times just for drinks and then came along for food  the other day. It's a fairly welcoming bar with perhaps just a touch too much effort on the decor. Very nice seating arrangement and overall a good atmosphere. I know they haven't been open too long so I'll forgive the somewhat clumsy service that was none the less fairly effective.   The menu was really good and similar to the Holyrood 9A, which I assume is the same chain.   I had a burger and starter for 10 (a deal mon-thurs I think) which was great value. However I must admit that the mozzarella and tomato salad was probably overpriced if you paid for it outside this deal. The burgers were good value in general though and tasty. Great string fries too.  They have a great selection of beers - although a few times the list was not very up to date so despite boasting 15 or so taps they didn't actually have any of the ones I actually wanted. Would have been good to have a board with the beers that had run out.  I got a carafe (1L) of red wine for 8.50 which was surprisingly REALLY drinkable.  A few other niggles. Lipstick on glass. My burger came 5 mins or so after my friends (it was a pretty quiet night).  However overall a totally great night. I will be back and hope that the next time it'll be just as impressive. After a few more visits I will happily upgrade my star rating if it remains satisfactory!",

    "text": "I've been to Red Squirrel twice in as many weeks because of the handy location (very close to Filmhouse, Usher Hall and Traverse), its great menu deals and nice atmosphere.   Admittedly, I didn't have high hopes the first time I visited the establishment. It's located in a unit on Lothian Road that has had many owners over the last few years and I've never been very enamoured with any of Red Squirrel's predecessors. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the pub is well presented, has a good atmosphere and doesn't suffer from a cheap and nasty vibe.   The menu is good quality pub grub, and there's a great deal on two courses for 10 and three courses for 13 - brilliant! The place is owned by the folk that take care of Holyrood 9A, so there were some great burgers on offer as well as other pub grub staples like mac and cheese, fish and chips and some more unusual items like a \"plank\" of food to share.   On my first visit I ordered the veggie haggis burger and then a dessert of sticky toffee pudding. My second visit afforded tomato and basil soup, followed by the veggie haggis burger (again). The portion sizes are very hearty and the staff are pleasant and accommodating. The food is excellent value for money and very tasty.   There are also some good deals on alcohol and a fab selection of beer. I spied WEST brewery steins of lager on my first visit.   My only jibe is that burgers are served on wooden trays with grease-proof paper. The grease proof paper quickly gets soggy and rips apart - sometimes sticking to your food - so a minor inconvenience to an otherwise fab dinner. Not too sure why the paper is even there in the first place!   Overall, a worthwhile place to visit in the centre of Edinburgh. Long may Red Squirrel continue.",

    "text": "This bar has changed hands more times than I can remember over the last 5 years, with pretty much every combination of traditional pub or trendy wine bar attempted and each one has failed to make a mark and lasted less than 12 months.  I think that pattern may now finally be broken as the Red Squirrel proves itself to be exactly what Lothian Road was missing.  As far as I know, this is owned by the same people as the Hollyrood 9A near The Pleasance, which is a great bar and an infinite improvement overs the Hollyrood Tavern that it replaced.  The winning formula has been applied to the Red Squirrel, but this is certainly not a straight up copy.    This place is a fusion of a \"trendy bar\", with its modern feel, great decor, upmarket drinks and very professional staff but is also somewhat a \"traditional pub\" in the way that it's warm, inviting, has lots of proper beer on tap and in no way feels pretentious.  I have been a good few times now, and its works just as well for a quiet afternoon lunch, drink and chat or as part of a big night out with a large group.  I was in once on a Saturday night when it was packed wall to wall after a gig at the nearby Picturehouse and still had no problem getting served at the bar, the staff were exceptional at managing a crowd.    During the day its very relaxed but even at its busiest late on a Saturday night, full of people, I found it was no problem being able to enjoy a conversation. The music was good and not so loud that everyone needed to shout and was actually very pleasant despite the fact that I am easily irritated by bars that busy.  The food is also great, taking the tried and tested burgers from Holyrood 9A but adding more to this mix such as breakfasts, soups, salad and their take on bar classics (i.e. fish n chips etc).  I am a huge fan of a burger that has been done properly and these burgers are of the highest quality I have found in Edinburgh, with varied and interesting toppings.  I have also tried their veggie burgers (based on portobello mushrooms, or halloumi) and they were also great although if I had one criticism it would be the mushrooms burgers are a little light on the mushrooms!  Its definitely not a cheap bar, but with the quality high you do get what you pay for and would say it offers great value.    Regardless of if you are looking for a quick lunch, a quiet afternoon pint, or to make a night of it, the Red Squirrel seems to work well under most conditions and is definitely worth a visit (or two!).",

As we sat down with our selection from the interesting and long beer menu (and Aspall cider on tap!) in the cosy booth seat, we felt a Friday evening happy glow of getting the weekend off to a great start at a lovely place. The staff were friendly and chatty and the prices very reasonable for a city centre location.   This place lingered in our thoughts and although it's a bit far from where we live, we've made an effort to come here a couple of times since. Once for lunch (good halloumi burger) and another time for a few Saturday daytime beverages. They've got some great opening offers on their cocktails at time of writing, and you can also try out more of their vast range of beers by buying sample glasses  third of a pint for a 1 I think  great for the unsure.   Definitely a firm favourite at the moment, highly recommended.",

    "text": "i'm between three and four stars for the red squirrel, but as it's one of the holyrood 9a bars i'll let it get the four stars.  why the debate?  well it's a bit difficult to review as i really only popped here to meet the boyfriend after work for a quick drink before heading on someplace else.    being right bang in the middle of lothian road and the financial district of edinburgh this bar was packed on a friday night!  which shows two things, either it's very popular with the business people or it's one of the few decent bars in the area.  i would tend to lean towards the latter as this place is fairly small compared to the other bars on lothian road.  however, it does have amazing burgers as i saw and smelled from the couple being served at the table behind me and they have an awesome selection of innis & gunn beers which is my preferred beer to drink.  the red squirrel definitely looks like a cool place and being branded with holyrood 9a i know the burgers will be delicious, but something about it's location isn't convincing me to rush back.  so yes, 4 stars i'm a fan because it's a good place to meet the boyfriend since he works across the street, but not such a fan because i prefer the atmosphere at the other 9a venues compared to this one.",

    "text": "I recently acquired the nickname \"squirrel\", due to a mishearing of my name, where Cheryl evolved (or went the opposite way...I am hopefully more evolved than a medium sized rodent) into Squirrel. Not an offensive nickname in any way, I quite like the red squirrel as it goes, even if they are becoming endangered, and spend their time hiding away from their grey counterparts...actually, I think I'd rather be a grey squirrel, but without the bullying tendencies.  Anyway, this is hugely neither here nor there, and completely irrelevant, but I did choose to go to Red Squirrel one Sunday evening, purely based on the name, and with zero regard for what the menu might possibly be like. I did do a very swift bit of online research, and discovered the rouge squirrel was related to Holyrood 9A, which I very much like. I was also quite keen to give this new Lothian road addition a chance, given that it's not an area I tend to frequent for food very often, aside from the Filmhouse.  I am always indecisive when it comes to choosing food, and on this specific evening I was particularly indecisive, but in the end I opted for the 10 for two courses indicated on the board, which is a bloody good deal, let's be honest. My 10 got me a large bowl of tomato soup, with two big hunks of bread, and a burger, topped with guacamole and Orkney cheddar, with some fries and a coleslaw concoction of some kind. The portions are generous, and in no way correspond to the lowness of price, which is a plus obviously. The soup was good, and tasty enough, but needed a wee bit of seasoning. The burger was pretty standard, which was a tiny bit disappointing considering guacamole and cheddar are normally a winning combination when heaped on top of beef, but I just wasn't hugely in love with the burger's texture or taste, plus the chips and the coleslaw needed something -  just a little bit of extra flavour. All in all though, not bad considering the price.  On a good note, my friends and I did happily sit here for a few hours, blethering with a bottle of wine quite comfortably. I like the interior, I think they've made it chilled and welcoming, and I'm actually still drawn to the place because of its name, because I can be shallow like that. Maybe I'll return and try out another two courses for 10 experience, or maybe even 3 courses for 13, but realistically, considering the size of the portions, I think managing a finale of sticky toffee pudding might be pushing it, even for me.",

My husband and I took a wander down Lothian Road recently one Saturday afternoon (not where we would normally venture for a quiet drink it has to be said!) and decided to pop in for a drink and a bite to eat. There is an excellent selection of beers, with some unusual ones that are difficult to get in other pubs around town and they had a good selection of cocktails for those who prefer other options. Staff are also happy to let you have a taster of beer before you buy to ensure it is to your taste and they are very friendly and knowledgable. The lunch menu is pretty standard pub grub but it is all done very well. We had two burgers from their extensive burger menu and didn't manage to eat another thing all day, they really were that huge! Only issue with our visit was that there was a big tour group that came in shortly after we had ordered which took over a large area of the pub so you might want to time your visit so you aren't surrounded by lots of people trying haggis for the first time as it seemed like it was a regular finishing point for the tour. This wasn't really an issue for us though and we are looking forward to revisiting soon and trying some more of their extensive beer selection.",

    "text": "Visited this pub for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and have been back three times since then! With an extensive menu of gourmet burgers, you really are spoilt for choice. They don't skimp on size or quality either  the giant burgers on soft sourdough buns are served on a wooden board, with skinny fries and slaw on the side. The first time I visited I had the guacamole burger, served with bacon and cheddar  I'm not exaggerating when I say it was amazing! If you can manage anything afterwards, I'd definitely recommend the warmed chocolate brownie, served with a generous helping of vanilla ice cream. At two courses for 10, the prices are extremely reasonable  especially in its city centre location. As for its drinks, this is where Red Squirrel really gets top marks. With their wide range of contemporary beers, the only difficult part is choosing what to go for. But the friendly and knowledgeable staff will help advise you. And if you still can't decide, they offer a 1/3 pint taster for only 1. And if you're not a big beer drinker, you can look towards the delicious cocktail menu. Excellent value at 3.95 each. Or if it's just an afternoon cuppa you're after, they offer coffees, tea, suki teas and a great hot chocolate. With its dark wood fittings, low level lighting and atmospheric music, Red Squirrel is a great place for catching up over a coffee, grabbing a quick lunch, meeting for a pint or sitting down for an evening meal. Top marks.",

I was a little skeptical about ordering nachos in Scotland, but they did a real good job and so we devoured the entire massive plate, stuffing our bellies (or at least mine) to the brim.  The beer list is extensive.  While looking at the menu, we noticed that they also order a breakfast special - two country breakfasts (one egg, haggis, sausage, beans, toast, tomato and mushrooms) + one coffee for I believe somewhere between 10-11.  Neither of us had ever had haggis and this was obviously on my bucket list for Edinburgh, so we came here.  Breakfast was good, but the egg was definitely overcooked.  Otherwise a very tasty breakfast.",

I wasn't 'wowed' by my Pioneer burger (not after reading the rave reviews for the Holyrood 9A burgers) but it was ok and I ate it all. The Chicken Italienne seemed to go down well as did the Bohemian (which looked like it had far too many ingredients packed into a bun for my liking)!  The service was fine - however our food came at different times even though I did put in a pre order to avoid this from happening. I was fairly relaxed about it though as this is what normally happens with a larger group although the Manager did promise me it wouldn't. The only annoying thing was that as the chief organiser, my burger came last for some reason, and some of the guys had nearly finished theirs.

    "text": "Owned by \"FullerThomson\", who also own the \"Hollyrood 9a\" & \"The Southern\" it's fairly similar in it's food menu and beer selection. Decor wise it's slightly more open and almost Bistro style, although there are some darker more intimate booths at the back.   It is well located near the bottom of Lothian Road so handy if you are around the West End of Princes Street, although due to nearby offices and entertainment venues (Usher Hall, PictureHouse, Traverse Theatre) it can get busy and finding a free table can be difficult at times.  The beer selection is good, with a large range of tap beers on offer, although I get the impression that the staff are not as passionate about beer as their sister bar staff. On my last visit their beer blackboard had not been updated and it took three attempts to get a beer that was actually available, considering it was 2 o'clock in the afternoon this seems a bit lax. Although having said that, I've never had a problem with the quality of beer served.  The food is good, with a wide range of predominantly burgers on their menu and I've never heard anyone complain about the quality, to be honest I think the burgers at \"The Southern\" or \"Hollyrood 9a\" seem to be better although I couldn't really pinpoint the difference.  Given the choice of the three bars, I'd have to place \"The Red Squirrel\" third but due to it's location I've probably visited here more often than the other two. And I'll no doubt return again for both their burgers and beers.",

Only issue was the bartenders seemed a little inexperienced in cocktails, but that could easily be because they were younger in age and only trained to the menu. Not a real issue in that case. Very cozy and great music.",

    "text": "Red Squirrel is fine.  It serves food (which I've not tried) and beer (which I have), but finds itself somewhat lacking in atmosphere.  I came here last night (Thursday) after Napier's graduation ceremony at Usher Hall (which is like half a block from here).  I thoroughly expected it to be packed full of celebrating grads but found it pleasantly dead.  Minus the children.  What was with the children?  Is it legal to have children in bars at 7pm?  It's not like this is a restaurant that happens to serve booze, it's a bar,and shouldn't your kids be in bed by now anyway?  Weird.    As an enjoyer of the 9a, I expected a lot more from Red Squirrel than it delivered.  The place felt pretty meh and the bar staff seemed bored/tired/uninterested/something like that.    In short, glad I tried it and though I wouldn't argue if a friend wanted to go there, I certainly won't be planning a repeat visit.",

They've managed to create a perfect unisex environment by having an extensive beer selection for men and a complete lack of sports TVs for women. Yeah, the beer is pretty expensive and the food is just not quite as good as you'd hoped, but Red Squirrel makes up for it by being a great place for couples to hang with other couples. They've shot me right in the demographic with this one.  I'm a 24yo man-o-leisure engaged to a beautiful 24yo girl. We don't really go to nightclubs anymore. We don't really go to sports bars. We don't really go to uni bars. We go to places like this, grab a booth in the corner and quietly proclaim \"These are our people\". Places like this are perfect for us to take other couples out on 'dates'. There's no stuffy awkwardness of a fine restaurant, there's no sweaty rage at a pingin' 'nite' hole, there's only mood lighting and checkered floors to ease your descent into middleagedness.  Right in the demographic.",

It was delivered promptly. I noticed the bacon being over done - crunchy and charcoal like. I did advise the waiter and he did not offer to replace them;  'sorry' was his response. An empty stomach makes for sweet appetite and I did eat most of it.   A special mention needs to go to the 'french toast' - don't order this. It is rubbery and tasteless. I tried to liven things up with some sugar, but to no avail  Afterwards I was offered 10% as an apology for the not so nice experience and as this was only one breakfast I am not coming down on this too hard. But it does affect my feeling of having breakfast here any time soon.",

The other pubs (The Southern & Holyrood 9a) both took fairly run down bars and turned them into good gastropubs, somehow though the Red Squirrel can't escape the roots of Lothian Road. While the clientele in the other two bars changed (improved) Red Squirrel is more or less still populated by an odd mixture of suits and folk having a pre-clubbing meal/drink there is a vibe I can't really describe...  The beer/cider/spirit selection is all present and correct and the food is good, though I didn't think it was as good as The Southern or Holyrood 9a, for the location though the Red Squirrel is a decent choice.  If there is a gig on in the HMV Picture House then Red Squirrel will be very busy, otherwise it varies. So overall good, but a bit like the youngest sibling that hasn't matured yet.",

    "text": "So I am going to paint the picture here...... lazy, sunny, fabulous sunday afternoon. I have a friend down visiting and we need some eats. I then had a lightbulb 'AH-HA!' moment where I suggested we go to Red Squirrel. Having seen the menu and knowing that is one of the sister bars of Fuller and Thomson we decide you probably can't go wrong!  The interior here is much different to that in 9a, it is kinda like an American Diner with black and white tiles and all the windows along the front give a great amount of light to this place.   We were promptly seated which was great, service was good and friendly! Although I have got to say maybe a little bit too much waiting around considering they weren't THAT busy!?   I ended up going for a strawberry milkshake. Yum. And Macaroni and some Garlic Bread. It was nice, my main issue being..... not enough cheese!! It kinda didn't taste of too much. If I am going to order Macaroni I want it to literally have about 3 blocks of cheese in it, and this did not come close!  My friend had one of the burgers as he has tried them before and was just as pleased with the one he had here.  I like Red Squirrel. But I have to say the selection of beer on tap here is not as good as what you would get at Holyrood, but the menu does show a little bit more diversity. I guess it depends whats more important - beer, or food. And for me beer wins..... every time.",

The Swiss burger I had was succulent and the mushrooms were a bit different, but a tasty addition to the burger (I'm used to having onions) and the sweet potato fries were amazing, especially dipped in the garlic mayo that came with the burger.

I went for the Blue Murder burger (beefburger with Blue Murder cheese, bacon and mushroom) and Kris opted for the Chilli Death burger (pickled jalapenos, fresh chillies, applewood cheese, sour cream and habanero ketchup) because he is nuts   Everything was perfect, the beef itself was juicy and not tough, crispy bacon with mellow mushroom and the Blue Murder cheese was salty, creamy and deeply satisfying to eat. The fries that came with the burger were also treated with due deference and weren't an afterthought on the plate; they were seasoned beautifully with a hint of chilli powder and cumin asburge well as the usual fixings. Kris was equally impressed with his Chilli Death burger, describing it as: \"Fucking awesome... Right level of uber spicy with the sour cream cutting through it with a nice balance.\" He also loved the obviously homemade pickles and gherkins.   Both burgers were reasonably priced as well, I would definitely return and recommend. I want to work my way through all their burgers!",

    "text": "The Red Squirrel is a pretty solid gastro-pub towards the Princes Street end of Lothian Road, not far from the Usher Hall. I've been here quite a few times and the atmosphere is lively, the food is tasty, the beer selection is excellent and the staff are not bad either!  The Red Squirrel is part of the Fuller Thompson chain, who own a handfull of charismatic pubs in Edinburgh and Dundee, including the Holyrood 9a, The Southern and the new OX184 down on the Cowgate. Not only do I totally rate all of those pubs, but each has their own unique character and focus and The Red Squirrel is no different.  If you're into trying new and craft beers, The Red Squirrel is a great shout. It doesn't go as crazy and off-piste as The Hanging Bat, which is just up the street, but they always have a decent selection of real ales on the pumps and an outstanding array of quality bottled beers.  But it's not just beer! The bar is very well stocked and this is not a beer-only pub by any stretch. I've been here on a Friday and Saturday night and it gets a mid-trendy and post-work clientele with a lot of fashionable young people, so not just old men, neck-beards and beer nerds sipping at their unblended lambic beers through pursed lips. I was here on a stag night one evening years ago and the bar lady was extremely patient with us and was an absolute star with sorting us out with a dirty pint.  In terms of food, there are some long, Bavarian-style wooden tables and benches near the front of the place, which are excellent for big groups. There are also more conventional 2 and 4-person tables elsewhere in the pub. The food menus are not massively exciting and extremely burger-centric, with loads and loads of different types of burgers to choose from (including three different veggie burgers!). If you've been to a Fuller Thompson pub before, expect more of the same food-wise at the Red Squirrel.  Unfortunately, The Red Squirrel hits me right in the pet peeve in that it serves chips in small metal buckets and everything else on slabs of grotty wood instead of actual plates. WHY?? Why can't we just have plates??  Also counting against The Red Squirrel is that there's no real separation between the eating area and the standing-around-at-the-bar area. If you're unfortunate enough to end up in the wrong seat on a busy night, expect a loud corporate wanker with a loosened tie and rolled-up sleeves standing right next to you and gabbing loudly about his jaunt back to Sussex in the Landy with Rollo and the chums while you try and wedge that haloumi burger in your gob. Also expect people to continually push against your chair as they squeeze past to go to the toilet.  On the whole, The Red Squirrel is an excellent pub and great for a bite to eat, but avoid the busy times, especially Friday and Saturday evenings, if you want to eat your food in peace!",

When you go to a place that's owned by the same people who created pubs such as the Southern and Holyrood 9A, you know you're in good hands.  So let's break it down:  Food: Four stars. You'll get a darn decent meal here, complete with several scrumptious veggie burger options for those of the persuasion. Toss in the option of sweet potato fries, and you've found my happy place. The price is on the mid-to-upper end of reasonable pub grub fair, but worth it because it's consistently yum.  Drink: the Squirrel has a decent rotational tap on hand, and also offers a pretty decent selection of bottled fare, making this an excellent joint to meet up with friends for a pint.   Atmosphere: I dig it! It's plenty spacious on weekdays, though I can't vouch for it on busy Edinburgh weekends. The interior is all wood furnishings and dimly lit, but clean as a whistle and nicely laid out.  Service: no complaints here! I've never had a bad run-in at the Squirrel. Service with a smile, and the servers and bartenders are always helpful and friendly.  This is a good shout if you're looking for a place without needless amounts of flash, or aren't feeling the old-man-pub vibe. Sure, it's missing a little bit of the personality that you may get from such places, but it's got plenty enough to stand on its own. (And it's close to my neck of the woods, so I'll certainly be back!)",

It just doesn't have the atmosphere of Holyrood 9A or The Southern. The menu is all right but the service, the feeling and the chairs are, for some reason all wrong.  Lemme give you an example.  I headed here last Friday as I had some friends staying in the West End of town, I figured Lothian road was a good, easy spot for them to find and a beer and a burger is a casual enough for a 'hey I haven't seen you in 3 years!' catch up. I booked in advance and found this my first obstacle. Any time I rang the person on the other end couldn't hear me. It took me three goes and afterwards I felt a need to check my booking had actually been taken.  When I arrived my friends had been seated and had their drinks. It then took me 15 minutes to catch a waitress and get a pint. When I say catch, I mean literally, at one stage I hopped up and legged it after a girl because we hadn't seen one in so long (a waitress, not a girl). When I caught her and said we were ready to order food when she had a minute I was told 'Yeah hang on I'm just doing something'.   Our order was eventually taken and the food was delicious, ginormous nachos fit for a king, venison burger for me with sweet potato fries, delish! Finally we had 'The Kitchen Sink' between 6 of us. You need more than 2 to finish it I reckon!  Although The Red Squirrel doesn't have the cosy comfort of it's sisters the food is just as good, but the service and atmosphere really let it down. It always feels more crowded than the other two (maybe it is!)   It's not my first choice for a burger but it's alright.",

Having been to several places recently where the food was disappointing, I finally got a better class of gourmet burger. My only problem was that I went for halloumi and I've since discovered I'm not so keen on halloumi - perhaps not the best choice but at least I now know I won't eat it again. The burger was a decent size with plenty of filling. What let them down was the skinny fries. What is it with skinny fries! I want a chip. A real substantial, fluffy on the inside crispy on the outside chip, not shoelaces masquerading as chips.  I had some sort of pineapple cocktail to wash the food down, but quite frankly I should have had beer, not the place to get a cocktail! As mentioned by other reviewers the staff seem to be quite social with each other which could be a little annoying to some customers.",

I am yet to waver from ordering one in my 3 visits here, although I've heard great things from my friends who have have sampled the other dishes available.   Besides the name, another reason I like the Red Squirrel is for the cider and beer - there is great selection of yummy beverages, from Thistly Cross to Blue Moon, and it is a great place for after-work gossiping with friends.  It is also a really handy location and is spacious so I've never had a problem with it being too busy (on week nights).   Lastly, the sweet potato fries are the bomb!",

Just unfortunate seating, looked better a bit further in with couches and boots etc. They have a lot of beers on tap and gladly let you sample as many as you like! I personally liked how many different sizes you could get your beer in, the 1/3 was just perfect for me just wanting a bit of a taste with my dinner. Nice staff, lovely food, will gladly come back!",

We had a glass of Chenin blanc each - nice, chilled and reasonable price and sat and watched the world go by. Saw a few people get food and got to say the burgers looked awesome!

I only had to give the menu a glance to realise this was the place for me.  They had a great selection of craft beer both draft and bottled. There was wide choice of burgers on the menu and I ended up picking 'Death by chilli' which was a beef burger with jalapenos, habanero sauce, sour cream and tomato. The burger was amazing, the hot chilli's gave it a real kick but the sour cream cut right through it and balanced it well. My burger came with fries which had been coated in cumin and chilli power which complimented the burger well. It also came with large home-pickled gherkin which was skewered to the top of the burger. This was all washed down with a Brewdog 5am saint :) Christina went for 'blue murder' which was a beef burger with blue cheese, bacon and a flatcap mushroom. She described it as \"creamy and delicious\".   Would highly recommend if your looking for a great beer and even greater burgers.",

We stopped in here on a Thursday afternoon around 1400. We were promptly seated and served waters. They have plenty of beer on tap here and I selected a local one.  Of course I opted for the vegetarian haggis (9.95). It comes out like a burger topped with smoked cheddar and chili jam. It was a little dry but very good. The chips were what made it though. Crisp and fresh. Yum.  I would love to give this place one more star, but the server was slow and we never did get a refill of water. I probably would have ordered another beer too if he had been more attentive. Overall it's a great place and I'm sad I can't try their brunch.",

Ok may be not that exciting of a reason, but being this is my first time in Scotland and a coworker told me to eat at a pub, for lunch, I found the Red Squirrel. Since it was an odd hour (4:00pm) for lunch, there wasn't much of a crowd. I started with a smooth beer and a burger, topped it off with sweet potato fries. The beef was excellent, with its moist texture and not overly done flavor. The bacon was more like a smoked ham and not a lot of guacamole on my guacamole burger, but actually the over burger tasted  good. I enjoyed it a lot. Now the fries were a bit on the soggy side, but good flavor. So overall I enjoyed my late lunch and would go again. The staff was pleasant and helpful as well. Enjoy.",

Reservations are suggested - we saw many people get turned away because their are about 12 tables. It IS good for Groups (assuming you can get in). Gastropub is an accurate description. They are known for their gourmet burgers - I had the blue Italian, which was a delicious mess of melting blue cheese and prosciutto on the brisket burger.  There have some Classics such as fish & chips. There is a decent selection of vegetarian dishes - even vegetarian haggis! We wanted a big breakfast - which is literally what it is called. Egg, sausage, bacon, toast, hash browns, mushrooms, tomato, baked beans, black pudding and even haggis!! We also enjoyed pancakes. Be aware their bacon is what we would call Canadian bacon in the US (think what is on an egg McMuffin) The drink menu is extensive and eclectic - lots of gin drinks plus the typical  whiskeys. The vibe is casual, local, hipster, but it is good for kids (assuming they are well-behaved and occupied by an iPad ;)",

It's a cozy gastropub in downtown Edinburgh. It was pretty busy when we went but we were able to be seated upon arrival. It also happened to be the evening of one of the Euro matches so understandably why they were busy. They have a decent selection of beers and other libations to choose from.   We each chose a local beer (full pint for him, half pint for me) and both ordered burgers which is what they are known for. Fun fact, they have a good beer selection and even feature rotating beers from all over. When we were there, they had a beer from California. I had the lamb and mint which was their version of a lamb burger and he had the Jerk Pork. Both of our burgers came with a side of fries.   The beers were tasty and the burgers were delicious. I thought the lamb burger was well made, flavorful, and not dry. The husband seemed to like his burger too. Great local spot and good place to watch the match. Relaxed vibe and good service too.",

    "text": "I wanted to love Red Squirrel as it seemed like a really good pub but it was seriously let down by slow service and slow food.   I popped in for a bite to eat about 45 minutes before a meeting around the corner. I thought this was plenty of time and ordered quickly. The burger is predominantly burgers which is ok if you love burgers - I'm not a massive fan but ordered a grilled chicken burger (10.95)  The place was busy, I'll give them that, but the food took more than 30 minutes to arrive which was just a killer when I was starving hungry and needed to be somewhere else. That left me with not much time to wolf it down which meant I didn't really appreciate it, that being said it was a perfectly fine burger. I'm sure the burger I ordered was meant to have ham or bacon on it and I did notice this was missing but as I was short on time I didn't bother saying anything. It was also really hard to get a staff member to order anything - they all avoided our table and didn't come back to check up on us.   None of this would put me off returning to the Red Squirrel as I'm sure it's a good pub and I liked that it's dog friendly, but if you're in a hurry you might want to head somewhere else.",

    "text": "Red Squirrel ended up being one of the chillest spots to eat and drink during my time in Edinburgh. The service was good and the vibe was laid back, but still had the buzz of laughter and conversation from other groups there.  It was surprisingly easy to get a table for two during the weekend evening. The menu has a nice variety of options for both food and beer, but I stuck with my classic fave - fish and chips. This place serves battered hake instead of the more common haddock or cod. Honestly, it's not much different, but you do end up with a fat square slab of it in a crispy battered crust that ends up slipping right off. No biggie, you're here to eat, drink, and relax, not judge the next Food Network Star. You get a never-ending pile of chips with it, along with mushy peas (I learned they love peas here). It's a solid dish to accompany their well-priced beers.  I definitely recommend the sticky toffee pudding - sweet, moist, and topped with a perfect portion of vanilla ice cream, I'm convinced there's no better way to end a meal in the city. Red Squirrel's pud is springier than other places I've had it, so it doesn't lose it's integrity sitting in the eventual vanilla ice cream soup you end up with if you eat it too slowly.   Prices are definitely reasonable for an average traveler or local. Plus, they have a stamp card but I'm not sure what it's for since I was only visiting. Recommended as a solid spot.",

    "text": "Great beers and friendly service but the food is mediocre at best.   We missed the breakfast by let's say 30 minutes, and the waitress was kind enough to offer that she would ask the chef if he minds cooking up a breakfast nevertheless. Although the place was almost empty, the chef didn't bother going the extra mile and that was quite a disappointment to be honest.   My pal who was with me is a recognised chef in Edinburgh and he also thought it wouldn't have been too much to ask to cook a breakfast instead of a burger.   Our burgers were okay at best. What ruined them for us mostly was the untoasted and stale bun. Toasting a bun really isn't a hassle and we thought this was yet another opportunity where the chef could've gone an extra mile for us. The burger was more than well done and the quality of the beef a 3 out of 10 at best.   Time to cut the long story short: We're not coming to the Red Squirrel again.",
