    "text": "We had a Magnificent meal last evening. Disclaimer - I'm not a super 'foodie', not a fan of super frou frou micro meals but have decent taste buds. My husband had Tender lamb and an apple meringue crusted tart. I had Mussels (an abundant portion in a great sauce) and Hake on a Tomato and mash base, followed by a chocolate tart. This was an exceptional meal, extremely good taste and well presented by our host and hostess. The decor is quite simple but maintains a subtle elegance.   Be forewarned- there are eight tables and you will be very unlikely to walk in and gain one from 6-9 p.m. I personally watched nine couples ask the hostess for entry and turned away.  Thank you for a wonderful evening!!",

    "text": "Delicious food on Leith Walk at a very reasonable price - this was an absolute gem of a restaurant we found, rather unexpected by the location and unassuming exterior. They allow you to bring your own bottle of wine which also keeps the price down, even though they do have a license.   We picked mains and deserts from the lunch menu which were all fantastic - including shetland mussels, spiced lamb filet, corn fed chicken breast and sticky toffee pudding. Definitely the best meal I've had in Edinburgh for a long time!",

What used to be Cafe No.9 has now been transformed into a very cute French bistro.   We decided to treat ourselves one Friday after a long week at work and as it is over the road from us we couldn't really resist! Table booked and BYOB wine in hand we headed in.   The staff are delightful and we were shown to our table. This place is not big - about 8 tables - and they don't have printed menus as this changes daily. Instead they ask you to look at the chalkboard mounted on the wall. The Walnut offers a range of starters and mains, all are very reasonably priced, I go for the chicken liver parfait and David decides to throw a curve ball and orders the cheese board to start :-/. For main, the roasted cod for me and the lamb hotpot for David.  As I said our waitress is great, she is adorable and very attentive. Before I know it I'm devouring my parfait. It is delicious made even better by the homemade oatcakes, I only got two though. More, more, more please!   Our mains were equally as delicious. My fish was perfectly cooked. The portion sizes are generous but not over the top so we were nicely full.There is always room for desert however. I went for more cheese and David went for the chocolate tart - nom nom nom.   All this came to 40! Amazing!  Go - go now!  Cheers, Amy",

    "text": "i just didn't believe this small, rather inauspicious looking bistro could be as good as it was cracked up to be. Lots of people said it was awesome. Turns out, it is better. Yes it's small, almost down at heel but it's instantly one of my favourite eateries in Edinburgh. So basically this is a Scottish bistro.  Menu had beef, chicken, pork belly and a good selection of fish dishes, and decent vegetarian options.  I had Loch Fyne scallops with a caponade and parmesan; my dinner companion had rollmops. Both were delicious (that's saying something when it comes to rollmops, which i normally hate).  I then had 1/2 chicken with hazelnut leeks and companion had fish stew.  Everything was delicious, with the chicken about the best I have ever had, moist and seasoned to perfection. I couldn't resist sticky toffee pudding, which was like the real stuff I've had in Cartmel; sublime. We brought our own bottle but you they have a license and a wine list.  We ended our meal with coffee which was top notch, again a good sign given just how many restaurants don't seem to realise how mediocre coffee can spoil a lovely meal.  Excellent service at a very reasonable price (75).  One of the very best places I have been to in Edinburgh.",

This is a foodie place bar none... so don't be a fool and stay in the tourist areas for food, come here. Oh... did I mention it's inexpensive? Yeah... it pays to explore!",

Located on 9 Croall Pl, The Walnut offers a variety of extremely fresh and hearty foods, which are a real treat on a lunch break after a tiring morning spent at work. Among its incredibly tasty appetisers, you can also find fresh crab at really convenient prices, which is quite a rarity in Edinburgh. Both fish and meat can be found among the selection of mains on the menu and everything tastes like your grandma would have cooked it in the warmth of her own kitchen.",
