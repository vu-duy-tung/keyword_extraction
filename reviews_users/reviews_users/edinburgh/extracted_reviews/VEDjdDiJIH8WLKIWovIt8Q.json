    "text": "Staying in Stockbridge we found ourselves checking the menus of a range of restaurants for dinner and Good Brothers seemed to have the most appealing range of dishes on offer. There were no tables as we arrived, but after a short wait at the bar a table became free and we pounced. Our waitress, a lovely Finnish woman, took excellent care of us, and helped significantly with the choice of a bottle of wine, recommending a Rioja to accompany our meal. Three of us had ribeye steak, each done as we liked it, and one had the duck terrine with a side of fried potatoes, and all of it was excellent. It was a very nice evening and fairly priced, too.",

    "text": "The Bon Vivant is dead, long live Good Brothers!  Popping up without much fanfare, Good Brothers has opened up in Stockbridge, where BV used to be. Decor wise, at the moment it's still very similar to its predecessor (which is by no means a bad thing), but with a few of their own twists (wine crates, casks etc.) and I imagine it'll become a bit more personal and unique as they find their feet.  We stopped by last night for a bite to eat. At the moment the menu is very limited, just three starters (all on sourdough toast), three mains and a cheeseboard. Kip S went for fried chorizo to start (he can't see chorizo on a menu and not order it) and I opted for garlic mushrooms and spinach on toast. Neither was wildly exciting, but they were well executed and tasty.  For main course there's the option of plaice, steak or a vegetarian option that I don't remember. We both went for steak, which was served with yet more mushrooms and spinach, and some new potatoes. Again, not exciting, but done well and more than satisfying.  There are some really interesting wines on offer too, with 5 by the glass so far, including an Austrian red and an Australian orange. The owner was happy to make recommendations (including 'fessing up that he thought one of the reds was underpriced, which is surely something he could rectify if he wanted to), and we were both pleased with our selections. A word on that actually, the owner and his staff were lovely, very keen to offer advice and check we were having a good time.  Good Brothers is very, very new, but it's showing promise and it deserves to be on your radar.",
