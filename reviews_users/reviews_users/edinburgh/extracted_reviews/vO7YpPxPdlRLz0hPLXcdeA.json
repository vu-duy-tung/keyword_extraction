    "text": "Love my little Henderson's just a few blocks from my flat. The place is small, but welcoming, a good spot for breakfast. If you go in the morning (before 11 I think) they offer a free coffee with your breakfast which is definitely a plus.   There is lots of natural light and comfortable seating. It operates at a relaxed place but usually isn't full unless it's the weekend. I love that they have board games to play too, including an Edinburgh themed set of Monopoly. Last time I went I had a mocha and the \"green start\" breakfast which was absolutely delicious with egg, avocado, spinach, green salsa and a tasty flat bread.   I will say it's a bit pricy, but if you take advantage of that breakfast deal it makes it more worthwhile. Have spent some enjoyable time here :)",

    "text": "Hendersons is fine. The mismatched colourful furniture and decor is interesting, and it has lots of windows and natural light. The service is a bit slow and the tables aren't always cleaned as quickly as they should be. It's also annoying that the coffee prices listed above the bar are takeaway prices, with no sit-in prices listed so it seems a bit like False advertising. 2.65 seemed like a lot for a cappuccino since it wasn't the best I've had and was disappointing. Overall this little place will do the trick though. The vegan and vegetarian food looked good but I haven't tried it.",

    "text": "Hendersons on Holyrood Road has had a mini makeover so some comfy booths and high tables in addition to friendly staff and a fair range of sit in and takeaway lunch options. It was however worryingly empty bang on 1pm on a week day. The weektime crowd are mainly workers so speed and price (which their predecessors were maybe lacking) as well as good food are key. It's an airy, bright venue and Hendersons has a longstanding reputation in the city so hoping the combo works out as there's not a lot of options near by.",
