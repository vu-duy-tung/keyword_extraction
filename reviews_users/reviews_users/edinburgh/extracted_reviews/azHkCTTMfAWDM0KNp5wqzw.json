It's super hip, the bottom floor has more life as it is open, great place for large parties. The inside is very modern with a base shade of dark grey which is lightened with intense blue, purple and yellow. Upstairs is perfect for groups up to four, as it has smaller tables there. Amazing interior here as well, with transparent fabric creating a soft division between groups. The food is divine and is fairly priced, with an interesting variety. The barrooms are clean and fresh, which is always greatly appreciated. The staff are kind and always around, so one is never left wanting for long. Great place for trendy people of all ages for sure!",

    "text": "This place is a bit weird. Ventured here on a Saturday night looking to try some BBQ, but after going to college in the Southern US my hopes were fairly low. The interior of OX184 is pretty cool, a hip warehouse sort of vibe but not uncomfortable. If anything I found it a bit cavernous. We had called earlier to ask to make reservations for 2 and they said 9:30 was the only time available...ok...but when we got there it was pretty much empty. A bit strange.   We ordered a bunch of starters/small plates to share and the food was...not good. I honestly found most of it WAY too salty. I love chicken wings and they were so salty I couldn't eat them. I like greasy BBQ food but this just was not greasy in a good way at all. The drinks were ok, but served in these big heavy crystal glasses which again I found a bit strange with the vibe of the place. The service was good but I really doubt I will be coming back here for food again any time soon.",

Deduct a star for really inconsistent service (my last visit involving having to send back 2 items the waitress straight up got wrong and then essentially having to pay my own bill due to staff goofing off with each other (in person and over their radios) to the complete ignorance of their customers. I would deduct 2 stars based on the staff in this visit (around midnight Mar 9/10) but it's been decent in the past. However, I WILL deduct 2 stars for prices. The quality of the food is nothing special, the drink is nothing special, and the service is definitely nothing special--so why am I paying 11 for a burger and chips?  Hard to justify unless I leave feeling like I had an excellent experience.",

Also the smell, ahhhh I can't even describe, so smoky! You just have to go and experience yourself! My advice if you go here, order meat!!! And lots of it! The wings, the hot rib tips, jalapeno smoking piglets, steak, sausage, ribs are all so tasty and cooked to perfection on their wood fired grill! Unfortunately every time I order anything other than meat i'm disappointed. I could not find ANY lobster in my shrimp and lobster sliders, both times I've had them :( the mac cheese side was bland and just ok, the bacon cornbread was dry and my fries were overdone and unseasoned.  I can't comment on the burgers as I've not tried any but next time I'll defo give one a go! If they can just bring their sides and non-meat dishes up to the same level as the meat I would defo give OX184 a 5!",

    "text": "Happened to stop by the same week this place opened and so nicely surprised.  Great for food and/or drinking.  The craft beer selection is immense and one of the funky more unusual aspects of this bar is that you can get a huuuge bottle of craft beer for your table (I think around 8 litres for 30).  Just be sure you like the beer you choose first!  They also do these weird & wonderful shot combos called Picklebacks - a shot of pickle juice and a shot of whisky.  It kind of works ... i think.  The food is also tasty - wood fire grill themed.  I had the half smoked chicken which was huge and the cheesy fries - one thing to note it's not simply grated cheese on top of fries - it's like a gooey creamy sauce instead. I wasn't a  fan but everyone else seemed to love it.  The bar itself is huge with quite a lot of space upstairs where the booths are curtained off for privacy which is quite nice.  The lighting is also very darky - purples and reds.  Stays open to 3am!  Staff really helpful when choosing drinks and quick service. Oh and ground floor is apparently dog friendly",

Granted, maybe not fair to review this after a Festival visit, and I don't think they had been open too long...but I will just say a few things. They were nice enough to seat 6 of us with no reservation. It was obvious how busy they were and the place is massive, so I don't think that makes it a picnic to serve in when rammed. We ordered drinks and some food. I had a veggie burger, which was nothing special and lacked a sort of sauce. I appreciate most places offer a veggie burger these days, but my general experience is that they aren't very good, and this was no exception. I sort of wish places wouldn't offer something that isn't going to be enjoyed by people who actually have no other option to eat it. Now, I do understand it was busy, so it could have easily been just wanting to get the food out, but maybe a BBQ joint isn't the place for me to eat a veggie burger anyways. I might go here for a drink again, but prefer smaller, quieter places.",

I was told to sit anywhere and one of the three waitresses handed me a menu. I asked where the restrooms were and told her I'd be right back but that I was leaving a couple things and would be right back. When I returned shortly, my water bottle (purchased and partly consumed) my map and the menu which were all left on my table were gone. I mentioned to another waitress that I would like the menu and water back (I forgot about the map until I needed it much later) and she waived me off and said ok. I sat there for at least 5 minutes or longer and was summarily ignored by every one of the waitresses. So I left. So if you don't fit the university student demographic I guess you aren't valued here. I had a much better experience at another restaurant near Greyfriars.",

Last time I went, they were featuring a local brewery - can't remember the name of it now but had a great selection, and a delicious mocha stout. My friends had some food as well, and apparently the halloumi burger is fantastic.  It's a bit quieter than other bars in the area, which can be nice. Also a great spot if you're looking to go with a large group. Very modern decor - and big windows facing the street, which can be so entertaining for people watching at 1:00am on a Saturday.  Also - I don't know if it's on the drinks menu anymore, but if you can find it - get the winter gin and tonic. Sooooo delicious if you like nutmeg and cinnamon flavors.",

    "text": "We had dinner here one night in November (2018) as a group of 4. The restaurant was very busy but the staff were really helpful and friendly and got a table for us as soon as possible. The food here was great value and super yummy. We all got different dishes for our dinner and everyone was so happy that we decided we would go back there for breakfast the next morning. When we arrived the following morning (hungover heads ready for the best food and service like we received the night before) the place was not busy at all - nothing like the night before, everything was so calmed and relaxed. There was only one (very large group (15+)) table occupied when we first arrived. We ordered quickly and had our coffees served to us quickly enough. We noticed a couple arriving and occupying another table - making it three tables in the whole building occupied so it seemed manageable. To our surprise the coffee was awful. It was so milky I could barely taste the coffee in it as did the other people on my table and we said we would complain it to the waiter when he brings our food - which I have never done before about anything so this was a first for me. So we waited as our coffees were getting cold - 15 minutes passed, no sign of the waiter and only three tables still occupied, 25 minutes passed - no sign of our food and then at about 30 minutes the waiter came down to us and apologised for the delay in our food and offered us another cup of coffee on the house (which we still hadn't complained about the previous one) so we saw this as a great chance of just getting another cup of coffee instead of complaining about the first one. This time I asked if I could have a DOUBLE SHOT in mine as the previous one was so milky tasting. Our food finally arrived along with our coffee. The coffee was still pretty milky with a slight taste of coffee and the dish I had ordered was okay - not great tasting, not bad but was not worth more than a half an hour wait. We all left with a bitter taste in our mouths from our second experience here after having such a pleasant one the night before. I can't say if I would recommend here for breakfast but dinner was great. Never have I ever experienced coffee like this - I don't know if it was the type of coffee beans they used or if it was the person making it but it was definitely the WORST coffee I've ever had.",

I can remember the location for the bar being several terrible meat market style pubs and so it was pleasing to see that there had been a mini makeover that had turned the slutty girl from high school into a fairly cool young woman but you could still see the signs of the past misdemeanours.  Firstly, they've done what you would expect, a changing supply of quality beers on draught which is going to challenge the nearby Brewdog. Holyrood 9a also has a great reputation for its food and its here that Ox184 loses a mark on its older (and slightly more cooler) brother. I had a snack from the Lights menu which was a Chorizo Flat bread, it came out on nice looking wood plate that dwarfed the food on it - it wasn't even a full flat bread. It was an odd combination of warmed chorizo and not quite cooked cheese, certainly not the quality I usually get from the Holyrood bar.  The guys serving were really attentive and pleasant and do make the bar stand out from the nearby opposition of Brewdogs \"too cool for skool' atmosphere or the 'can't be bothered to care' staff at Three Sisters so will carve out a little niche for themselves.   It's good to see the Cowgate getting another quality bar but it needs a bit of a tweak in the food offering to come up to the class of its older brother down the road.",

Sad to say that when there on a Thursday night in festivals season that I was really unimpressed by some of the staff. I don't mean to sound like a grumpy short person but the staff tend to serve the person that shouts loudest - or the tallest! The bar is seriously high. The waitress only brought menus when I hunted her down and then never came back for an order, ever!",

It does get super busy here in weekends so don't expect to be served asap! They do great cocktails and have an amazing selection of beers. I wouldn't go here for food necessarily, but it's a great venue for a lovely pint (or 2/3 or jug!)!",

    "text": "This bar / kitchen / grill is right bang in the middle of cowgate where it is happening especially during the weekends.  The establishment is divided into 2 floors.  Ground floor is the main bar area, with long tables & chairs for food.  Upstairs are more seats for restaurants and some sections are good for groups as seats are 'curtained' off for a little bit of privacy.  I believe there is also a small area for private group.  There is also a grilling section of the kitchen here and you can watch them cook while you drink.  I had my leaving do here and what they do is they give you a big section downstairs for your group to mingle around.  Towards 10pm on a weekend, there are also DJs to pump up the atmosphere.  Staff here are great and extremely helpful too.  They also have a good selection of beers and ales which is always good for after work drinks.  Prices are reasonable high Edinburgh prices.  The food is mainly western carb / fat laden and grilled meat.  The item I have tried here a couple of times is the lamb chop and it is highly recommended.  Right proportion of fat and cooked how I liked it.  I didn't have the pulled pork but my colleague had this twice in 2 lunches which says how good it is.  The baby back ribs is slightly on the dry side so maybe avoid this unless they improve.  Food can be a bit slow to come out so suggest come here when you are not rushing.",

The barman proceeded to talk to his colleague the whole time (so evidently he can multitask) and it wasn't until another barman came and offered his service that I was able to get a menu. Unimpressed. The food has yet to be tasted but hopefully it's better than this idiot's attitude.  Okay. Have just eaten and I've gotta say- the food was pretty good. A big thank you to our waitress Ruta for being accommodating and amiable. We had 2 people with intolerances with us and she made sure the dishes were safe to eat. The other staff would do well to learn customer service from you, Ruta.",

The food took a while to arrive and we were a bit taken aback by how spicy everything was, including the fries and the BBQ sauce on the ribs (?!) which meant that said 3 year old couldn't share any of it (though she had a brave go). Fortunately aforementioned fab staff ran up to get her some unseasoned fries at no extra cost.  I quite enjoyed the pervasive smoky smell on a cold night. However I found the food a tad overpriced and it took a long time to come when we were one of the first people eating. May give it another chance but will be sure to ask for unseasoned fries next time!",

I can appreciate it's a newish place, and they probably are taking on extra staff for the fringe, but I nearly passed out water for out food and drinks to arrive. A bunch of orders for both booze and food were forgotten, and what wasn't took an age to show up.  Generally we were happy enough with the food that arrived, although I felt my Halloumi burger could have done with a bit more grilling.  OX184 has a pretty decent vibe, and seems a lot better than I remember it's predecessor being, however it really failed to light me up this time round.",
