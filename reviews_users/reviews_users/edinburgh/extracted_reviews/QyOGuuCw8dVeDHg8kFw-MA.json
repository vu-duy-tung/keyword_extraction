When my girlfriend and I looked at the menu online, we assumed that the portions must be very small since each dish was so cheap. As a result, we ordered 4 entrees and a starter. When the food was delivered (via Just Eat), we were blown away by the massive pile of food in front of us.   I admit, it wasn't exactly gourmet cooking, but we enjoyed our selection of foods - Szechuan chicken, cashew chicken, some kind of amazing chicken wings (yes we like chicken. And it was decent chicken too, not some questionably dry dark meat hunks), duck chow mein, and spring rolls.   CGFT is no destination for a fancy evening with the missus, but more of the guilty pleasure food you order when hungover and don't want to change out of pajamas. I will certainly be ordering from them again.",

    "text": "I went into Chinese Good Food Takeaway when I was in a rush one evening to grab my dinner and I probably won't go back.  I should probably have known the meal wouldn't be up to much when I saw the name - Chinese Good Food - perhaps not the most original of names the owners could have chosen.   The menu was a standard Chinese takeaway menu with a range of chicken, beef and vegetarian dishes. I had the beef with mushrooms dish which had a really thick sauce and the mushrooms were soggy and had sort of disintegrated into the dish. The beef was really chewy and stringy - not nice. As Chinese Good Food is situated in the really student orientated area of Bruntsfield, I thought this place would be reasonably priced, but my meal came to just under 10.   My experience of Chinese Good Food was far from a treat and I next time I will go to the other cheaper and tastier Chinese takeaways in Edinburgh.",

For the students amongst you, you'll recognize that this is an internet-based way of getting fast food, fast. Unfortunately, being part of just-eat doesn't mean it's particularly good.  I had sweet and sour chicken (predictable, I know) and it was terrible. Really gloopy and soggy batter, and the chunks of vegetables were difficult to get around. The rice was really dry and there was a mysterious meat mixed in it....still don't know what it was. My friend had Chicken in Sataay and found it gloopy too, she said it was really spicy (which neither of us understood - it's a peanut dish) and she couldn't eat very much of it. Furthermore, it cost us 21 for the experience! There are far better and far cheaper Chinese take-aways in Edinburgh!",
