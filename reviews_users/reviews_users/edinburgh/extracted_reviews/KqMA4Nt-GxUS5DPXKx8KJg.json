    "text": "I know that no Greggs is different from any other but this one is pretty posh! It is Edinburgh's newest Greggs so it still looks shiny and new and the staff were very fast considering how busy the shop was.  There are about 30 seats in the main cafe area and then a few benches in the counter area. There were plenty of clean tables and we didn't have to clear anything away from our booth.  I had 2 sausage rolls, a packet of Walkers ready salted crisps and a Capri Sun. It may be very unhealthy but it is tasty and cheap and that is all that matters.  I went to the toilets before I left which were clean enough but could have been better.  There is a huge stained glass ceiling in the ordering area which really adds character to the building. The high ceilings also help make it bright and airy.",
