    "text": "The Gardeners Cottage was a bit of a letdown after hearing so many good reviews about it. Sat at a long table with wobbly wicker kind of chairs. Felt in extreme close proximity to the people sat at either side of me to the point it was hard to get enough elbow room to use my cutlery. It was difficult for the waiting staff to lift items from the table due to confined space. The food was actually tasty if not smaller than a starter and I could see why it would be served on a side sized plate due to confines again, of space. During the meal it was difficult to hear what my friend sitting opposite was saying due to two women on my left gradually increasing in volume as their wine flowed and a family all chatting on my right side. Again problem would have been solved with a bit of distance created by separate tables. There was music playing in the background on an old record player, quite crackly not all too unlike the sound of a gramaphone. After around two minutes when I had finished my meal I decided to leave for coffee etc elsewhere so that I could sustain a conversation without having to shout or stick to formal chat in the knowledge that it was pretty much impossible to not overhear everyones conversation.",

Although the menu is a set one, once you let them know of your food preferences, a steady stream of interesting dishes come from the kitchen; each one with an interesting twist. At the start sitting along side strangers seems a little weird but the food soon focuses your mind. Great place to eat.",

    "text": "One of the most fun dining experiences I have had in Edinburgh.  The food was perfectly prepared, fresh, modern, relaxed. I couldn't wait for each of the seven courses to come. Overall it was a perfect amount of food. My favourite course was a crab meat ravioli with bisque. It's a bit like having a taster menu. It was great to try so many lovely things in one dinner, however it was a wee bit disappointing that my favourite dish was over so quickly.  Everyone sits at the same table, yes, but I wasn't even aware of what people were talking about next to me. You can see the staff working away in the kitchen. The music is played on a record player in the room - a lovely thing to see. I really loved everything about The Gardners Cottage. Even my loose leaf peppermint tea was amazing. It was really good value too.",

    "text": "Came for lunch on a Saturday which meant choosing from a small A La Carte menu. Their brunch options were also still available.   The venue is not without it's charms - your unlikely to find another restaurant like it. Set off London road you walk through the garden patch and the seasons vegetables to enter an intimate venue, much more like a living room than a restaurant. Chairs are packed into a couple of large tables. This isn't like Wagamama's where there is space between you and the people beside you; you are practically touching elbows. I enjoyed the quaintness of it all and embraced it, but if this sounds like something you would find awkward it probably will be.   The food was good. A watercress soup and poached egg tasted fresh and was satisfying. The Hake was also perfectly cooked with nice accompaniments. A starter and a main course was probably a little bit too much food for a light lunch; the portion sizes were pretty generous.  Starters were around 6-8 and mains 16-18 which seemed in line with other place if a little expensive.  I probably wouldn't come here all the time but if you like the idea of fresh local seasonal produce and want a dining experience that is a little bit different then give it a go.",

    "text": "It was very serendipitous that we ended up eating here. We had failed to make any proper birthday dinner reservations elsewhere and in our searching I remembered having heard this place was good, so I checked their website and was able to book a table on-line the same morning. Very handy! We arrived at 5:45, which is generally a bit early for us to eat dinner, but with 7 courses we figured it was a good time to start. We were also quite excited to try a meal we didn't have to choose.  The location and cottage itself are idyllic, it does feel like you have wandered into a lovely English cottage and surrounding garden. The inside is so warm and cozy and it feels like you are dining in at a friends home. They have 3 tables, which seat 10 each and you sit next to the other diners, no separate tables. I quite enjoyed it as it just adds to the homelike feel of this place. I really love the surroundings and the record player spitting out some music from the 50s and you also get to watch the chefs cooking, which adds to the relaxing atmosphere.   The staff was exceptional. We were greeted instantly and seated right away. The staff was very efficient, but casual and so friendly. We were asked if we wanted any explanation of the menu or if we just wanted to jump right in. We opted to just jump in and I received an excellent wine recommendation to suite what was to come.   In order we started with the pig tongue dumpling, which was amazing. Small, but so many flavors and a delicious fresh slaw to go with it. Next we received sourdough bread with a beetroot dip, which was lovely and delicate. Following that we received a kale and bacon soup with blue cheese and toasted walnuts. It was very smooth and such a nice dish, the walnuts and bacon made it so hearty and complimented the line of courses well.   Our main was roast lamb, with gnocchi, wild roasted garlic, crispy purple sprouting broccoli and aioli. The lamb was served pink and was excellent, the gnocchi was light and buttery (so amazing!) and the vegetables were stunning. I especially liked the garlic, which looked like it had just been pulled with the stalks from the garden. I was so full after that, but the food was too good to even think about stopping. After that course we received a light biscuit \"ragstone\" with a very mild goats cheese and carrot jam. It was such a nice treat, well-sized and very good to have after such a great main.   Now the dessert, again so full, but luckily both desserts were so light and just wow! The first was a smoked pumpkin mousse, chocolate cream and hazelnut meringue. The pumpkin was surprisingly addicting and the hazelnuts have it a nice texture. The chocolate cream was rich, but not too sweet and it went so well with the pumpkin. The second dessert was toasted brioche, char-grilled apple, barley ice-cream and carrot and crowdie mousse. It was also to die for. The crowdie and carrot mouse was absolutely 'divine' as Paula Dean would say. It was so lovely.  The entire experience, meal and service was beyond any expectations I had and I was thoroughly impressed. It definitely is a splash and not something I would do often, but it is so worth it for a special occasion or something different. I would recommend this to anyone who is loves food and doesn't mind being served a meal selected by people who know what they are doing with food.   If you are picky or have any dietary things they do offer to try to accommodate those, but I personally would say don't bother trying it if you aren't a wee bit adventurous. This is an experience for diners who appreciate food and can respect that it is cooked and paired exactly how it should be for you to enjoy. Let go for a change and feel pampered by some pros!",

The difference was a whole menu dedicated to vegetarians and deliciously fresh vegetables.  The potatoes I had were the best I've taste.  I had a virgin beetroot Bloody Mary which was also the best I've had!!  My partner had a non vegetarian meal that he was impressed with as well.  This is a must try place for everyone!    The atmosphere was cozy too.  They only have communal tables, so done come to expect your own table :)  however, the atmosphere is super cute and romantic regardless.",

    "text": "Ok, so being a typical grumpy northerner, I was more than a little sceptical about the idea of going to a restaurant where I'd have to sit next to total strangers. Let's face it, what if one of them's a slurper. No-one needs that...  Thankfully I'm always up for trying anything - and this place didn't disappoint. As everyone's as wary of the seating as eachother, it's actually a very relaxed and non-intrusive atmosphere when you get in. The staff are very laid back, yet attentive, happy to discuss all the dishes and where the food comes from. If you're lucky, the chefs will also pop over (from their station in the middle, where you get to watch them cook your food) and do the same. As a hospitality pro, I've never worked with any chef happy to actually speak to their diners, so I loved this!!  Their menu is also a little different to the norm - for dinner, it's just a set 7 course tasting menu. Thankfully, the food is amazing!! The menu changes every day, and you get to walk past a lot of the produce on the way in, as they grow it in their own garden. Everything was incredibly tasty, fresh, and full of dishes I'd never even consider if just taking in a regular a la carte elsewhere. Great for curious eaters like me. AND IT'S ONLY 35?! I can only say, get in there before the prices go up - it'd be worth it at double the price.  I have to recommend places to eat quite a lot as part of my job, and the Gardeners Cottage is always my number one tip.  P.S - in spite of the set menu, they cater for virtually all dietary requirements too. The lady next to me came in and listed hers, worried she'd either get no food, or some woeful substitute. They rustled up a menu on the spot for her, and she proceeded to spend the rest of the evening making noises I've not heard in a dining establishment since When Harry Met Sally...",

    "text": "I loved everything about my experience at Gardener's Cottage.  I love the fact that the old cottage I used to bus by on my way to work is now in use. I love walking through a tiny productive garden to get to the front door, I LOVE that they use slates to define the raised beds (stealing that idea), I love that the food is in season, I love that it's creative and tasty and I can't be picky or safe and I just have to eat what's in front of me (as a formerly way picky eater, this is a big deal).  I know that the concept of GC can sound pretty pretentious or, as one friend put it, a hipster's wet dream. But I found the actual execution to be laid back, friendly, and delicious, with no pretension at all.  I think maybe that the big sharing tables force you to leave your BS at the door and just enjoy the experience. I also think that the INCREDIBLE (not listed) starter of warm home made sourdough with bbq'd purple sprouting broccoli and some kind of hollandaise-ish sauce helped that whole thing too. Of course next time I go it will be something completely different, and that's cool too.  Be prepared to be wowed, ok'd, and meh'd during the course of your meal. It's highly likely you won't like everything they're serving because you pretty much have no choice in the matter (unless you really hate something that's on the menu, or have an allergy or moral issue with it).  But, that's ok because most of the experience will be great and will leave you appreciating what Scotland had to offer even more.   Basically, loving it all the way and desperate to go back.",

Fortunately, they were able to accommodate me, but I gather that was only because I got there pretty early for dinner and was very very lucky. Make a reservation.  They offer a changing menu of 7 courses that is prix fixe; however, they appeared to accommodate a number of dietary restrictions of diners around me. (I got a pretty close up view, because you are sitting right next to them at the communal tables).  The staff were very efficient without feeling like you were being rushed. I had plenty of time to contemplate between courses while never sitting with an empty glass or finished course sitting in front of me.  Should I find myself back in Edinburgh, and I hope I do, I will definitely come back here.",

It also came with mushrooms and some Stornoway black pudding. Yum.  Good sized portions too.  We were sat on our own at one of tables so didn't get to partake of the communal dining experience.  It was good to see the chef at work in the kitchen from our seats and from the taste it was clear that everything is made to order using fresh produce.  Will definitely go back to try their dinner menu.",

Well, welcome to The Gardeners Cottage.  We headed here for a bit of a special brunch and were so pleased with the amazing food, the excellent service and the school room feel to the interior.  Arriving a bit down London Road, a small blackboard greets you an invites you up a small garden path with fresh veg growing either side. When you enter you're greeted by the smiling staff and shown to your shared table (advance booking is essential).  The menu shifts constantly based on what's seasonally available. I personally went for the dish with the catchy title: black pudding, bacon, mushrooms, apples, walnuts, greens, sourdough bread. It was delicious. I had a pot of tea with it and was sufficiently full for a good few hours after!  It's a fantastic little gem, I hope to get back for the set evening menu soon!",

    "text": "The Gardener's Cottage is a small restaurant set in the Royal Terrace Gardens. Illuminated on a cool November evening, the restaurant immediately had a good feeling as we walked up the short path towards the front door. A cosy venue, there were tables on both sides of the entrance, but as we were a party of 11, we had one of the sides to ourselves. The long thin table was perfect for the occasion of two families meeting prior to a wedding the following day. The chairs that had backs in them to presumably house a hymn book, and the lanterns around the edges of the room added to the ambiance. We were there for the seven course evening tasting menu. As we arrived we were shown a menu that suggested wines to compliment each course, a nice idea but it would have really enhanced the price, so I opted for a Barney's Volcano IPA, a very tasty, quaffable ale, that suited most of the night's courses. An eclectic mix of music gently played in the background from a record player on the other side of the restaurant, a perfect accompaniment for a sociable meal.  The staff were friendly, highly knowledgeable about each dish and nothing was too much trouble for them. To be honest, with so many courses, I am struggling to remember which order they came in and all the subtle flavours they came with; however, the first course was definitely a carpaccio of beef, with raw onion. A flavoursome start; my wife is not a big fan of raw onion, so with no fuss at all, they prepared an alternative dish for her containing beetroot instead, impressive. The next few courses, were widgeon, cooked pink, which was salty and delicious, one of my favourites on the night; and vegetarian course, which was a wholesome mix of seasonal vegetables, cauliflower stalks are surprisingly tough though. Other courses included a milk pudding with barley, not totally sure of that one, and a selection of cheeses, with crispbreads, savoury biscuits and the most lovely Goat's Cheese I have ever tasted! I freely admit, I am not the greatest fan of Goat's Cheese, but this was mellow and creamy, lovely. The stand out course for me personally though, was the hot pumpkin sponge cake with Sea Buckthorn ice cream, absolutely packed with flavour, the wholesomeness of the pumpkin, complemented perfectly with the sharpness of the ice cream. The final course was some Petit fours, which were Apple Crumble in a bite, and interesting mix of beetroot and chocolate. A delicious end to the meal; I'm sure I've forgotten a course, and most of the subtle flavours, but it was a most enjoyable evening of great food and wonderful company. Some of the courses didn't work me personally, but as a package the Gardener's Cottage offers unique tastes in homely surroundings. The strong Abernook Whisky to finish the meal, was a great Winter warmer too, before the short walk back to the hotel.",

Aside from that, the food was fabulous and you could taste the freshness of the ingredients as they base their meals around things which are locally sourced.  The wine & drinks list is fantastic as well. The ricotta & pumpkin cheesecake was a great end to the meal. The communal tables were pretty fun.  25 for 5 courses is pretty good value for money. Will definitely be back again!",

I had the hake with celeriac and amazing crispy kale - I guess it was dehydrated in the oven.

Interior is great, service staff are super helpful as well as the food being innovative and playful.  If we had more places like this it would be truly amazing. They foster great food all around by raising the bar for other restaurants. They care so much about what they are doing that it just shines through like a beacon.   It's a small open kitchen so there can be small errors here and there but nothing that would detract from the overall experience.   Go - but book ahead!",

    "text": "This place is really original with a simple idea and theme.  We were travelling back to see friends in Edinburgh and read about this place in The Week magazine. Having just returned from Cape Town where we had some impressive food, we thought this place sounded as if it would offer good value for lunch, with the food cooked from whatever is fresh that day...and thus the place would have some originality.  Like most folks who have commented on this place we were charmed! Sure the service can be a little muddled as all the staff, chefs included work at a pace, and a glass of extra wine did need to be asked for twice....but if anyone sits and waits for 45 minutes for a bottle...then simply get up and ask politely and I'm sure that you will get your wine...simple really!  The staff all seemed to have passion and smile, and spending my life running an inn, sadly I know that often this not is the case! They came across as human. What I also loved is that you can see the 3 chefs working in a small kitchen.  Onto the food...a great rabbit terrine, which they were making more of as we ate lunch...the smell was fantastic! I then had a black pudding..another starter as I was VERY hungry and then a fish dish from memory. All got 10/10. Sure the choices are limited (this makes it easier in my opinion) and you sit on long benches abutting long communal tables and elbow room is sparse....but hey for 25 quid it's a great meal and experience, and you may even speak with a local.  The wine choices are enough to excite and also reasonably priced. The traditional record player was quirky and refreshing in this I-Pod obsessed century. Yup LP's do stick and jump still!  Would I go back...sure! And then you pop round the corner for another snack at the wonderful Valvolla & Crolla!",

    "text": "This wee run-down cottage in Royal Terrace Gardens has been transformed into a rustic cosy little restaurant. They do a set menu of five courses for 25 and you can see the chefs at work in the centre of the dining area.   If you like elegant private dining you probably won't like this place as the tables are long slabs of reclaimed timber and you sit next to the other diners. It does make for a really good sociable atmosphere. A somewhat different and relaxing dining experience. There's none of the bother of choosing what to eat, the five courses just get served up to you and there's no rush, plenty of time for conversation.  You can ask ahead if you have any dietary requirements. The set menu is constantly changing, the night I went there was tender pieces of pork, a delicious bitter vegetable soup, fish, dessert, cheese... all the courses were excellent and thankfully none were too large so there was always room for the next one.  Very much worth the money, though to make sure you get the best value check what is on the menu as it changes very fast and then pick a selection that really suits you.",

A rustic quaint little cottage hidden in a small park that takes you literally as if you were out in the countryside. Our table was within arms reach and in full view of the two young chefs who were intensely prepping the meals. The servers were very friendly. The food was perfectly matched with the wine for each course. The meals were well-balanced. All the ingredients were procured from local sources and couldn't have been any fresher. Had a great time sharing the dinner with a friend here. There was some difficulty making our way out through the tiny door way which we didn't have any problems getting through earlier before the meals. ;-)    When in Edinburgh, a definite must!",

The decor is rustic, but charming, and entering past the garden full of herbs was a lovely foreshadowing of the meal.  We were seated at a long unfinished communal table, which we shared with other diners.  The tasting menu was set, but the chef was very accommodating to the dietary restrictions of one of our party (though they said had we warned them earlier, they could have provided more interesting alternatives.)  The food was all delightful, though since it changes frequently with the seasons and available fresh produce, I will not bore you with specific dishes.  Safe to say that everything was delicious.  The service was attentive, yet not intrusive.  The old record player in the corner was offering up Beach Boys, which was a bit of an odd note, but somehow not inappropriate to this eclectic dining spot.  I would recommend this establishment to anyone looking for a high dining experience in a casual atmosphere.  Should the winds somehow blow me back to Edinburgh, I will find my way back to the Gardener's Cottage!",

And to be honest, quite a rip-off at the price it is served.  The best course was the cheese. Delicious bread as well. Otherwise the meal was quite bland and unappetizing. It has great potential to improve however! I did like the community style tables and the idea behind the restaurant of fresh homegrown vegetables farm to table. The restaurant has just not fully translated that idea into high quality food yet.",

I could not believe that a place that sells itself as a vegetable-forward, farm-to-table restaurant would dare serve seasonal vegetables like that. It's August! I can't believe they allowed it to leave the kitchen. For me, it was hard to trust them after that. What followed was fine food. Pigeon had great flavor. The fish was bland but inoffensive. Dessert was nice. Best thing was the cheese course!  Overall, I would give them another chance. But. I'm disappointed!",

At 55 pounds for dinner, the food was plentiful, service was very polite and the atmosphere was nice and homey. Their menu changes but everything we experienced was splendid, great quality and filling. There was great variety in what they made including use of different vegetables that were in season at the time, different meats like mutton and pork belly, cheeses and displays of sweets like pear ice cream and salted chocolates.

After reviewing the menu we all went for the four course Chef's Menu for lunch and we couldn't resist adding on the beech smoke anchovies. The meal started off well with three slices of amazing sourdough bread from their bakery and beetroot hummus. The flavor and consistency of the hummus paired with the bread was perfect. Next came the plate of anchovies which were smoky, salty and really tasty. They would have been perfect with some bread but we consumed our one piece of bread included with the lunch and did not feel like shelling out another 3 for 3 more slices. When enjoying a 28 lunch this seemed a bit petty. Next was the pea soup which was fresh and tasty but the uncooked peas floating in it were hard and a bit jarring in contrast to the smooth soup. Next up was a really nice bit of cod with celeriac and chive oil, very tasty. Finally we ended with an honey cake, strawberries and a small scoop of ice cream. This place definitely has potential.",

The restaurant is extremely charming and the shared dining table is a nice touch (depending on your seatmates of course!) The service was excellent and the dishes were beautifully presented. When the server explained each course they sounded amazing but there was a disconnect between the description and the actual taste. The flavours were just okay. I can't pinpoint what was missing but after the first couple dishes we lost the anticipation for the remaining courses.   The one saving grace was the strawberry dessert. Somehow a mixture of cheese, strawberry ice cream and biscuits had us all licking our plates. Overall, it was a really cute place but I will try other places next time.",

The menu was a surprise, as with a focus on seasonal produce they change the menu daily according to what they have in. So many places claim the same focus these days but I was really impressed with what these guys did with fresh, local ingredients. It really felt like each one had been very carefully chosen for slightly unusual but delicious flavour combinations. A warming starter of pumpkin soup was teamed with a crab and caerphilly tart that I could have eaten 5 of. The main of mutton loin joined warm beetroot, celerian puree and kale on the plate with a cep crumb. Dessert taught me what seabuckthorn was, and made for a cake close to lemon in flavour with hay ice cream and peanut nougatine.  Each dish was well presented with arty flourishes that didn't go over the top. I enjoyed spying on the plating up going on in the kitchen as they endeavoured (and succeeded!) in turning out 18 consistent plates. Both our servers were v attentive with wine top-ups and great for answering food questions too (of which there were several!). The part that made our boss happiest was that it's great value for money for a special meal too - on a regular night the 5-course set dinner menu is 25 (though you'll probably end up spending more on wine as a result!).  I can imagine some people won't be fans of the communal seating, but take the right people up the garden path(!) and give it a try for the delicious food. Highly recommend for a private dining event too - they handled our rather noisy group brilliantly!",

    "text": "Had a lovely and atmospheric dinner here during the festival.  This place offers an eminently affordable prix-fixe 5 or 7 course for 40 or 60 pounds.  The service is lovely.  The restaurant is in a park and has its own garden.  Service is considerate and attentive.  The food is delicious - very simple preparations of outstanding local ingredients for the appetizers and more complicated sophisticated techniques for the mains.  When I say simple I don't mean unimpressive - I mean delicious, fresh, and imaginative without torturing the ingredients into unrecognizability.  I mean a stunning summer salad of tomatoes, herbs, and home made ricotta - unctuously creamy and fresh with the right amount of slightly peppery bite and tang.  I mean a whole grain bread dipped in superb olive oil and a terrific mix of spices (black and white sesame, cumin, fennel, coriander) with fine quality salami.  The pasta was a carbonara reimagined with local Scottish ingredients and flavors - it was a revelation.  This is a stunning price for such high quality food.",

Everything was timed perfectly. I was a bit apprehensive with a seven course, but the portions were perfect. Flavor wise, everything was unique and distinct, nothing was too overpowering. It was really the perfect way to end our stay in Edinburgh. I highly recommend!",

    "text": "The gardeners cottage is a place I had heard a lot about but not actually been to for a meal.  So when it was suggested as our next date night, I happily agreed.   After two cocktails at a nearby bar we walked over to the tiny cottage in the middle of the gardens in London road. On arrival we weren't initially greeted or even acknowledged.  After an awkward period of 5 minutes where we just stood by the door, someone came over to get the card machine and said another waiter would show us our seats shortly.  We did wait another few minutes before being shown our seats.   Now the whole idea of this place is communal dining with food from locally sourced ingredients.  It's hard not to like that idea but I have to say our evening was rather downtrodden by the poor service of the staff.   Sitting in between two other dinner parties was fine although the seats are a bit close.  And the idea that you just get seven courses brought to you is great! But the wait between our first and second course was about an hour, if not more.  And in that time no wait staff came to let us know that there had been a mistake and our courses would be delayed.  In fact when I tried to try their attention I'm pretty sure they just ignored us.  When the second course finally arrived there wasn't even an apology...   Thankfully the rest of our meal seemed to go more quickly with courses being brought out in appropriate times.  My favourite courses were the cheese plate and the last dessert which unfortunately I no longer remember what it is.   This place isn't cheap and the fact I can't recall the meal particularly well makes me wonder if it's worth the cost.  And then the service, two couples arrived 30 minutes after us and left 45 minutes before us; one couple only getting 6 courses instead of 7 due to a mistake in the kitchen. The whole experience fell a bit flat for me and the service left me not wanting to go back.  However the company for the evening was 5 stars :)",

    "text": "A cozy experience in a charming setting with thoughtfully prepared and plated food.  Each course had unexpected elements with fresh and lovely ingredients.  The menus change daily and are rustically written on a chalkboard at the front of the restaurant/cottage.  Service was kind and friendly.  The place is small --- looks like it used to be a small one-bedroom home and we snuggly sat shoulder to shoulder next to other diners... Our first time dining communally and it was a rather fun experience.  We lucked out and sat next to some very friendly diners.  Overall, we enjoyed our experience.  Truly a restaurant with a lot of heart.",

Had a pea soup with crab and a poached egg for a starter followed by hake with kale and scalloped potatoes with apple butter.  Hubby had the big breakfast with poached egg, yummy bacon,  back pudding,  meat loaf and bioche with hollandaise. Quaint place with good presentation,  fresh ingredients and different menus. Only down side would the seating as you're elbow to elbow with other diners!  Would recommend for a special occasion, cool music by record player and nice decor.",

    "text": "I had been excited to try out The Gardener's Cottage for a while so I snagged us a table one Saturday evening. The evening menu is a 7 course tasting menu for 40. A very reasonable price for a fine dining restaurant.  The place is actually adorable. A tiny cottage tucked into the gardens on London Road. Once inside you feel like you are going round to your grandmas for tea, not a bad thing! The tables are long benches tightly packed with chairs and even though it wasn't very busy when we arrived we were sat right next to another couple. I know the place is small but this made the experience quite awkward and uncomfortable especially if you are looking for an intimate dinner.   Nevertheless we were excited to try the food. The kitchen is open plan and you can see the chefs busy working away. We chose a bottle of red from the wine list for 28, it was delicious. The staff are very friendly and attentive. They explain each course as it is served to you.   Each of the courses were beautifully presented, although very dainty portions. The ingredients are local or foraged and the flavours were earthy and organic. As if straight from the garden.   I hate to say it but nothing blew me away. The plates looked amazing with some very exciting and unusual ingredients but we left feeling disappointed. It just seemed to lack something. I expected the dishes to punch me in the face with flavour but everything was quite bland. The most memorable thing was the sea buckthorn sponge which was pretty delicious!  I would loved to have come away and raved about our meal at The Gardener's Cottage so I feel very sad that I can't. At a meal that came in at over 100 we wanted more. I can't rate the staff highly enough but the overall dining experience and the food were OK.",
