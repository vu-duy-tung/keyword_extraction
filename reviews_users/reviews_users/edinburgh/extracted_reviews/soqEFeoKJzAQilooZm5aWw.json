I definitely cannot experience this in San Francisco, and already know I will be missing this place when I head home.  A perfect cup of latte, fluffy and moist scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, toasts, and a small cup of bean soup here made a snowy morning a pleasant way to start the day to explore the city.",

    "text": "How frickin cute is this place?!  Fellow Yelper Hamish S and I wandered here on a Saturday morning... and when I say wandered, I mean he knew exactly where he was going and I tagged along looking lost. I'm still not great at finding my way around this area, which is a shame because I miss out on little gems like these, but my bewildered lack of direction felt suited to a place named \"The Hideout\".  It's a sweet little cafe, with a cute collection of vintage knickknacks and a hodgepodge of tables & chairs. Like a paint by numbers hipster cafe, this had all the checkmarks. Now I know \"hipster\" gets a bad rap these days, but they do know their coffee.  They serve the usually cafe cakes and pastries, along side a little food menu. On this particular occasion, I only had eyes for coffee, so I can't shed any light on the meal offerings. But my flat while was good... and really, on a Saturday morning, what more can you ask for?  My only eyebrow raise goes to the 5 minimum spend to use the card machine. I understand that businesses get charged every time they use the machine, but as someone who only carries a debit card, it is always a fuss to have to either find cash or double up my order.  But that little detail wouldn't stop me from popping in again... i'll just have to be more organized next time around.",

There's not a massive amount of passing foot traffic so not one to go to for people watching but good for meeting to catch up or to have someone else make the tea while you read the papers or a book. There's a selection of boardgames too.",

It even has an old ghetto blaster - man the 80's rock!  The food rocks too - I had a veggie wrap warmed, which was well packed and felt healthy and tasted yummy at the same time.  Ginger beer was my drink of choice because it was too darn hot outside for coffee and I needed a thirst quencher!  It took a wee while for our wraps to come out. They didn't look too busy, and I don;t think it was too complicated an order to process and make up?  The cakes are well impressive - I need to come back for coffee and cake.  They are made in house and look very appealing to gobble up (the cake, of course)!  I was tempted to take a piece away but resisted quite well, so I will obviously have to come back and try the cake now - ha ha!!",

Price for their coffee is reasonable and on par with other places locally . The atmosphere is relaxed. Recent addition is a cassette wall where punters can choose their own music for hundreds of cassettes from the 70s 80s early 90s . Love it . Our dog is very welcome and always gets fresh water which he spills over never to any complaint from staff.  My only complaint is that I wished it opened later into the evening ..ie 9pm as it's hard to get a cafe in leith open past 5pm to serve coffee and food. Maybe this is something they could consider for the summer months.   I'd vote it the best cafe in leith !!",

    "text": "I am not quite of the \"you can't have too many cafes\" school of thinking but not far away so I was pleased to see Constitution Street get another coffee focused cafe. Located on the corner opposite the Compass pub, The Hideout Cafe starts with the great benefit of replacing an eyesore empty site.  It's a bright space with a mix of furniture styles including a bench made of old pallets. One of its great virtues is the friendly staff with smiles and going that extra mile no issue. This good start is assisted greatly by decently prepared Artisan Roast coffee. Good selection of cakes and pastries.  The breakfast rolls and sandwiches are good too. Cost-wise the Hideout fits into the normal fancy coffee cafe bracket: around 2.20 for a regular sized espresso based drink. This is becoming increasingly popular including with the mums and occasional dad from local Leith Primary. It's obvious comparator business is Printworks 100m down the street. For the moment the longer established Print works may just have the edge for me but it's close and if Hideout continues to develop it could see itself become a popular quality cafe.",
