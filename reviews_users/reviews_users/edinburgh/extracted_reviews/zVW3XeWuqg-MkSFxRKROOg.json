    "text": "I have been to Nando's a couple times after university lectures to grab some dinner with friends. I think their peri-peri chicken is amazing and such a delight to indulge in after a tiring or hard day.  My favourite thing from their menu is the fino pitta. This is what I usually get from there. However, my most recent experience made me a bit wary. Perhaps it was the fact that my group and I came an hour away from closing so the servers were tired and in the mood to go home? I got the fino pitta and so did my friend as we both are big fans. However, this time it tasted completely different from usual. I am not sure what they did to it but the sauce they put in tasted just like honey...something that did not go with the mix of the rest of the ingredients and made both my friend and I unable to finish eating it. The usual sauce they have on this is a garlic mayo sort of sauce which is a great finish to the wrap. Without that, the whole taste was ruined.   My other friends ended up ordering salads and were also not big fans. Perhaps we should always come way before closing because apparently it is not worth coming any later...I still am a big fan of their wonderful chicken but I wish they were consistent with the taste of their products.",

This particular venue is very spacious with heaps of tables. Service is decent.   Same principle- get a table, order at the counter then go get your own cutlery and sauces before your meal comes.   So my order was the quarter chicken with two sides and my partner had the chicken wrap with a side of fries.   When my order came by heart sank, the chicken was not a quarter, it was more like 1/6 of the chicken which was just poor effort on their part. My partners wrap was child sized and we both were underwhelmed by the meal.   The two sides were grilled corn and Mediterranean vegetables- I was charged separately for them which I'm completely unimpressed by.   I guess I just like the thought of eating at Nandos more than wasting my money on half a meal that couldn't fill a child's stomach.   The food itself was good, but since it wasn't more than 3 mouthfuls I don't think I could elaborate anymore.",

We are a bunch of 9 and we separated ourselves into three groups and share food among the little groups. My group of 4 got a full platter with two regular peri-salted chips, a corn and the mash sides. Additional of a bottomless drink - share among the four.  The chicken was so nicely prepared. The sauces are really hot, even the herb or the garlic ones. Somehow I think the chicken goes better alone than with any sauces haha.  We four girls can barely finish the whole platter. It's huge and fed us all :)",

Asked for a glass for water later on and she made me feel like it's a crime to make her walk a few extra steps to get me the glass.   Self serving counter was almost empty - no knives, no forks, no napkins.  My coffee didn't come with sugar. No one was around and I had to go to the counter again to ask for it. Felt like they just threw us to a corner and disappeared so that we couldn't bother them anymore.   I had never experienced any service as unpleasant as this and I actually wondered if I had done anything wrong. This is from 5 months ago but still upsets me. Thanks for the unforgettable experience.   Have been avoiding this Nando's from then and go for the one at Omni Centre.",

A friend and I split a whole chicken with 4 sides and we were absolutely porked and satisfied. The chicken was tender and flavorful. You also have an option to add a wide array of sauces, which I'd highly recommend in order to tailor your chicken to your taste.  The service at the Edinburgh location is exceptional. I can speak to that much at least. Employees at the cash register were happy to assist with questions as my friend and I were first timers. Also, we got our food relatively quick.  My only negative remark would be the price. Expect to drop about 10 quid for a decent meal. Slightly pricey for casual dining, but the food is fantastic.",

They clearly haven't had the opportunity to explore the range of truly tasty restaurants we have in the city.  I've tried to like Nando's. I've even given it a few chances to win me over, but the overwhelming response each time is 'meh'.   It's chicken and chips. My gran knocks that together most Sundays and doesn't charge a hefty mark up.  The chicken isn't even particularly moist, in fact it's more often than not grilled to within an inch of its life. The chips, if the internet is to be believed, are supplied by McCain (based on my visits I wouldn't dispute that). If you're excited to see halloumi on the menu, don't be, as you'll only be served a few teeny slivers. It's all just a bit mediocre. Bland, soulless food disguised by a heavy slathering of peri-peri spice and/or sauce - the trojan horse they've used to build the brand.  My top tip for eating at Nando's is... don't bother. Chicken, McCains, hummus, halloumi, and even their own sauces are widely available in supermarkets these days. Stay in, do a better job of the cooking yourself, and save your hard earned cash for somewhere with a bit more oomph.",

Although I have to say, I think it is a great idea how you choose your filling, type of meal (eg pita bread, bun, etc) and also the spiceyness of the sauce - the lemon and mango numbers are great for those would like flavour but can't stand hot and spicey!!!    However I just thought that for what you got (a glorified burger basically) that it is well overpriced.  When I went I ordered two main meals plus two drinks and I barely got a few pennies in change from 30?!?!?!  Now the way I look at it is for this price I could have gone to a pretty decent restaurant and would have enjoyed spending that amount of money there rather than giving it to a place that is just a step up from McDonalds.  In fact, considering I can buy a meal for two for less than a tenner in McDonalds I think I prefer it to Nandos!!!    Don't get me wrong, the food was good but so is a Big Mac from time to time so in the end it was just an expensive burger and I've had better!

This is a great place to go if you want chicken, to be served quickly and know what to expect.   I like Nandos, it's simple if not formulaic but tasty food and I like to go there from time to time!  However, if you are not from Edinburgh, there a lots of lovely independent restaurants near by too!",
