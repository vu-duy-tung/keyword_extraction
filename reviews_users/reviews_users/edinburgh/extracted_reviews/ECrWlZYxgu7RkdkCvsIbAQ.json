And definitely have an oyster stout or a few.   Would recommend this place 10/10. Great service, good tunes, and great oysters. Thanks so much!",

I had made a booking for a Sunday evening but didn't really need it because the place was empty. I had the razor clams which were delicious, the cured salmon, and the tender stem broccoli. All were very good and I would recommend any of them. Service was great and I had a fantastic dinner before I had to leave the city. If I'm ever back in Edinburgh I'll have to stop by again.",

If they could have dedicated servers for certain areas so they check on customers and remember to bring out all the food ordered, it could be a 5 star yelp restaurant.",

The difference is that the fist time I just dropped in and sat in the bar area the service was fantastic and attentive. The second time I made reservations and sat in the dining area. Complete different place. Service was not attentive at all and was difficult to get any service. The food was still the same amazing food as before. I would suggest dropping in and eating in the bar.",

If you like fresh oysters, crab, lobster...well pretty much anything in the sea White Horse has it. The service, wine selection, food and beer are perfect. I believe I had everything on the menu.  I even swiped some food from a neighboring table. A must eat in Edinburgh. Don't go changing, I'll see you soon!",

    "text": "We stopped by to see if we could have dinner here due to the high yelp rating. We walked in and were half ignored for a few minutes. Finally, someone spoke with us and asked if we had a reservation, the answer was no and they went on their way. A few minutes later after we asked how long would it be again they went away and then came back and said if we wanted to wait over 2hrs they might be able to get us in before they close. There were seats at the front bar open and a seperate table at the front bar open, we asked if we could sit there and were told the empty table was reserved and we could not sit at the bar as that's for waiting customers to have a drink until their table was ready. We explained we were waiting customers and they would not allow us to sit. Two other people were seated their eating dinner and drinking. After that they just didn't acknowledge we were there so we left. All three of us independently thought that they acted very rudely, apparently don't want our money and a 1 star was in order. We walked past about an hour later to find the table at the front still open and chairs at the bar still open. I guess they have a right to refuse service and we have a right to write a review. I would suggest not wasting your time here unless you have a reservation.",

We walked in and were greeted with smiles. It seems that they do most of their business off reservations, as we had to be quick because all the tables were reserved out after a specific time. We had fresh shucked oysters, a crab Scottish egg, heirloom tomatoes and cheese, mussels with pork cheek, and a lovely glass of champagne. It was the perfect pick-me-up after so much walking. The interior of the restaurant was dark and quaint - I loved it. For it being off such a busy street and the front door wide open, the inside was private and relaxing. I would recommend this spot to anyone visiting.",

We had chosen this restaurant bc of their oyster selection we read about. We chose a selection of 4 types with our drinks. They were all presented beautifully at the table with an expertly described description of all by a friendly bartender/server. They were fresh and delicious..... certainly worth another visit!
