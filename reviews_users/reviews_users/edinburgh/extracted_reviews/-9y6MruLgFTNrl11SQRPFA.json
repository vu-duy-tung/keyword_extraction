    "text": "Stopped in here before a morning meeting at the university - situated perfectly for this! Have been following (ie stalking) them for a while on Instagram and after once doing a placement in Sweden, I am forever on the hunt for decent fika at home.   This place lived up to my expectations & more. It had such a cool industrial set up to it with lots of lovely hygge touches that we've come to expect. Got a table by the window to look out at people in the rain and feel smug whilst I was cosy and warm. The waitresses were lovely and came over right away to take an order. After eyeing up all the cakes I settled for an easy kanelbulle. The dough was delicious and knotted up all fancy with the perfect amount of cinnamon sugar inside. It was clearly cooked fresh very recently and paired perfectly with my flat white. Check out that coffee art too!!   Overall it was fab and I'm only sorry I couldn't spend longer in there. I'll be hoping to get through soon to sample their sourdough pizzas as spotted a huge pizza oven in the back. Also took away plenty of treats including a raspberry and chocolate jam which I cannot wait to try! Thanks Soderberg for providing the best fika this side of the North Sea - please come to Glasgow soon though.",

    "text": "After viewing some properties in the quarter mile development, it seemed important to venture into the world of food, drink and retailers that this area had to offer.   Soderberg is a great space, that they've made homely with lanterns hung from the ceiling and comfy seats to sit at. Considering they had a glass box to work with, they've made great use of the space and it's a lovely spot to people watch.   The coffees here aren't the best in Edinburgh and with Brew Lab being an 8 minute stroll away, I'd say it's worth the walk for a proper coffee there, however, does Brew Lab offer sourdough pizzas? The answer is no, and even if they did, they wouldn't touch the Swedish sourdough deliciousness that Soderberg  offers. Pizza can be bought in multiples of 2 slices, with a simple offering of margarita, and regularly changing specials of a meat option and veggie alternative. I opted for 2 slices of the margarita and was really impressed. Thin sourdough base, creamy mozzarella and a tangy yet sweet sauce.  I also had 3 slices arrive instead of 2, so considered this to be my lucky day.",

    "text": "There's a limited menu here for lunch but from the options you can choose from, they're absolutely delicious. I came here for the sourdough pizza. Was absolutely craving it and it hit just the spot.  There pizza's are thin crust and baked in proper pizza oven. For a large 8 slice pizza (easily shared between two people) it's comes at a good 12 price. We opted for a half vegetarian, half meat pizza coupled with a mug of their specialty hot chocolate. First, pizza was perfectly cooked. The dough was flavourful and slightly crispy, warm and perfectly cooked. Toppings were generous but not overloaded.  Second, Soderberg is known for their drinks and their speciality hot chocolates are an incredibly interesting taste (in a good way). I tried the cardamom hot chocolate which wasn't what I expected but it had a wonderful rich chocolate taste.  Overall, it's quite a small location so easily packed, but would definitely recommend for a date or small group meals. Especially if you're looking for some good pizza, this hits the spot perfectly.",

    "text": "Besides the fact that this might be one of the most confusing places to actually GET to, it's pretty darn lovely once you find it.   Now should you happen upon Soderberg without issue, that opening sentence will confuse you because it's not a tiny place. It's not as though it's tucked away in a hole in the wall. It's more \"hiding in plain sight\".   The problem arises with the Soderberg website/any sort of internet based direction within the Quartermile. Why? Because in a block of buildings with very little signage, lives THREE Soderberg spots: Peter's Yard, Soderberg Bakery Shop and Soderberg (this one.. the one with pizza). Following the confusion? The amount of times I've checked in to the wrong one... sheesh.  I've been a fan of the sourdough flatbread pizza for quite awhile and when the Peter's Yard closest to my house in Stockbridge stopped serving it, I purposely sought this place out. I heard a few grumbles during the festival of it being \"chaotic\" but having been right in the middle of Fringetown, you can hardly blame them. Now that they crowds have gone, I daresay it has returned to a perfect little spot to grab lunch when in the area.   Bonus points? With Looking Glass Books right around the corner, and free wifi in and around, it makes the Quartermile a one stop, out of office office destination. I'm a happy camper.",
