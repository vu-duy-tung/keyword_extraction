It's a very cozy location downstairs, but you really need to go here, it was without a doubt the best dining experience we had while in Edinburgh. Traditional Scottish and British fare, expertly crafted by a chef who obviously cares deeply about what leaves his kitchen. Well worth finding!",

    "text": "I just dined at Dubh Prais Restaurant last week, and had an outstanding experience!  My three friends and I agreed that this was the best dinner we've had in Edinburgh this year :-)  From the prefect haggis entree (with an exceptional whiskey sauce and equally wonderful wild mushrooms) to the incredible Venison and a salmon entree that almost literally knocked my socks off, the mains were simply divine!  Service was attentive, the desserts were also excellent, and the Romanian Pinot we tried on the recommendation of our server was a revelation.  There's simply no place quite like Dubh Prais Restaurant in Edinburgh; you MUST go!  When you do, be sure to make a reservation; the venue is both small and (understandable) very popular.",

    "text": "Do not miss going here!!! My favorite restaurant perhaps in all of Scotland. This is primarily due to the west coast broth (fish stew) being maybe my favorite thing of all time. The sweet and savory broth combined with the mussels and fresh salmon is just excellent, with my grandfather and I both wishing we could eat multiple portions. However, the fresh salmon entree was also extraordinary. Perfectly cooked, flaking off from my fork. I would order this every time. The accompanying potatoes also made for a perfect side to fill you full. My grandfather ordered the venison which could've been a bit more flavorful, but was cooked to a perfect pink as requested. I would eat here every night if I could and would order the west coast broth and salmon every time. Please leave these on the menu forever!  The restaurant itself is also adorable and cozy, being underground and less than 10 tables. Very romantic and nice while enjoying the perfect meal.",

I saw several walk-ins get turned away during the course of our meal, even parties of just two people. Regardless of the configuration, there's only 26 seats in the place. We were lucky to nab a same-day booking for an early 6pm meal, on the condition we be up and out by 8pm.  (We just barely it)  Everything about Dubh Prais is exquisite. The menu, staff, ambiance and most importantly the food are all fantastic and expertly executed. I'd be so bold as to claim that it doesn't matter what you order; it's all going to be good.  I had a large glass of the house red (a Spanish rioja) and it was insanely good for a house wine. My main - a dish of beautifully medium rare Angus medallions in a sauce of pure joy - was unparalleled. How the chef manages to prepare so many dishes so perfectly boggles the mind.  The desserts? Decadent. The coffee? Ever better. I was surprised when told they only did drip coffee, but oh man WAS IT GOOD drip coffee. With some raw sugar and a couple of free refills, I walked away full and utterly satisfied.",

I am skeptical about elaborated food in the UK: usually you end paying too much for dishes that only taste to butter :D However, my expectations about Dubh Prais were high (in part, thanks to A. Bourdain!). It turns out that my expectations were right. Wonderful experience! I got the mandatory Haggies, and I also tried the a beef dish and a the lamb. EVERYTHING WAS OUTSTANDING! Tender meats cooked to perfection served in a cozy and hidden restaurant in the heart of \"the Auld Reekie\". Best dinner in a while. Everything served by a nice Spanish waitress with Cordoba accent. Seriously? \"Yes! I am also from Cordoba!\". Chef McWilliams: I CANNOT WAIT TO COME BACK!",

The food is definitely not horrible, the service is okay (albeit a bit pretentious and judgy), and the ambience is nice, but for the price tag, I expected a whole lot better.  This is what we ordered:  Haggis - Had a good crust, but was a bit too salty for us.  Fillet of Scottish Angus beef w/ mustard and whisky sauce - We ordered medium rare and it came out medium well.  Edible, but that is a major fail for such a \"fancy\" restaurant.  We can get a steak from Costco and make it better at home for a fraction of the price.  Grampian chicken stuffed w/ Argyll ham, cheddar, and cider sauce - Okay, but nothing special; just reminded me of mediocre chicken cordon bleu.  I really don't get why people like this place and I think only tourists eat here.  If you still want to go, reservation recommended and be prepared for a one entree minimum per person.",

The entrance is a bit tricky, you will have to figure out where the door is.  Since its a basement cellar there is just a door on the street.   Inside, there's only a few tables so get there early-ish or make a reservation. Thankfully, we arrived on the early side and were seated immediately.  I had their smoked salmon appetizer - its fantastic and super fresh!   My mom had a seafood soup (might have been a special) which I didn't get to try. She also had sole with lemon as her entree. It had lots of flavor, very rich but delicate at the same time.  I chose to have haggis as an entree. Luckily, it turns out I really like haggis so I thought this was great.  The best part of the meal may have been dessert. It was a special - chocolate mousse cake concoction. Wow.  Fantastic service as well. I never felt rushed but we were certainly looked after.

They were happy to accommodate us and the chef even assured us a great meal as he peaked around the corner of the kitchen. I had the Venison that was served with a Port wine sauce and very tasty potatoes. I must say the Venison was full of flavor and quite moist, with no overpowering flavor of the meat. The sauce complimented the Venison very well and brought the flavor out to tantalize the taste buds. This is a great restaurant, with a very comfortable atmosphere, the staff goes out of the way to make you feel very welcome.",

Despite its location in the heart of the Royal Mile, it still retains loads of character and has a homey, off-the-beaten track feel to it. Much of that has to do with it being in a wee basement.   I now have been to Dubh Prais three times. I can't get past the haggis and the steak. Next time I'm in Edinburgh, I'm going to try to go twice: once for the haggis and the steak and another time to explore the menu a little more. It looks delicious. As should be expected from a top notch Scottish restaurant, the whisky list is exceptional.   If you're planning a visit to Edinburgh, definitely give Dubh Prais a go. You'll be wise to make you're reservation well in advance (for weekend evenings anyway). It's tiny and has some very ardent fans.",
