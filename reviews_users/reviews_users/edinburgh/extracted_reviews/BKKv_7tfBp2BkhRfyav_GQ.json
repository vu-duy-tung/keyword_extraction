There's an extensive range of wine available, the general atmosphere & use of the dining space are very convivial and the service was generally good.  Intend to revisit and eat in the near future so will see if that results in a change of rating.",

This place seems confused about whether it's a classy restaurant or a kooky indie eatery. In support of the former: it's elegant, spacious, and served us each an intimidatingly large glass on arrival with the wide base of its bowl moistened with a finger of white wine - complimentary, apparently, although it was just kind of plonked in front of me and I had no idea whether I'd be charged but was too English to ask. (Also \"plonk\" might be entirely the wrong word. I don't know, for obvious reasons!).  In support of the latter: it has a wide range of clocks on the walls, all stopped at somewhere kind of afternoonish time, so don't trust them if you're out for lunch. I know, I get it, \"tempo perso\" and all that, but it just seemed a little like trying too hard. There's also this weird screen showing some kind of cookery programme, to which, fortunately, I had my back, or I would have been utterly distracted.  That said - the food was pleasant - we simply ordered three dishes from the antipasti part of the menu to share between us as a light bite and they were pretty nice, all around the 6 mark. I'm not sure I'd have necessarily seen fit to charge that much for the mushrooms or the bruschetta trio (2 for each wee bit of bruschetta? Cheeky). I guess when the mains are hitting into the teens price-wise it's to be expected, though. The trio of bruschetta was excellent, however. The roasted vegetable one was my favourite.  For me, it's not quite settled enough to be a treat meal out, and it's not quite kooky enough to be characterful; I guess most of the competition in the immediate vicinity seems to be coffee shops and patisseries, though, so it serves a purpose and if you've got the budget for a full meal sometime in the evening when there's more atmosphere then I'm sure you'll have a fine time.",

If you're going to tout yourself as a fancy Italian restaurant, you need to deliver. They either don't know how risotto is made, or didn't cook the arborio rice correctly, because it appeared to be boiled long grain white rice. It didn't taste bad, but it lacked the creamy starchy texture and flavor of a real risotto. Our other meals were fine.",

The menu has a good range of foods and might be a little complex for those not used to italian food but everything is explained in the menu.    The portions are large and the fried seafood was particularly tasty.  The mussles n spaghetti was a little bland but that's the only complaint with our food!  I would say the staff are a little slow but when they do get round to you they are chatty and friendly in True Italian style.   Nice local restaurant,  good ambiance,  good food :-)",

Interesting other reviewer talks of confused identity - agree to some extent: is it an Italian diner style joint (sloppy burgers on diner style menu with TV screen) or a more sophisticated traditional Italian (good wine list, excellent pasta etc)?  One person's confused is another's quirky. Definitely worth trying.",

    "text": "Recently opened but as yet no website only twitter connections in Edinburgh Osteria del Tempo Perso, made lunchtime a no-faff deal. Great service, cosy surroundings, soft music, generous portions made our tapas styled meal all the more authentic. Very tasty and lovely presented food, interesting decor and great company all made for a unique lunch experience.  On arrival we were presented with a sample of house white wine and a small portion of Parmesan paste coupled with cheese crunch. A short time later after more catching up our group demolished a selection of veggie goats cheese bruschetta, mushrooms, ham and cheese platter. We had so much fun during lunch that an hour just flew by.  Twinned with their Italian sister opened around a decade ago on the East Coast of Italy, the team are providing authentic simplistic in style but delicious food combos with the exception of a menu without pizza.  Go and try for yourself as there are plenty tables for medium sized groups (table share), or romantic night out. I will have to come back again of course to try their macaroni Italian cheese pasta(made in-house) or some of their fish dishes.   The restaurant however was quiet when we were in, over the coming weeks I'm sure they will be peppered with pre-event bookings. But in all another decent Italian establishment to add to the culinary delights in our great city.",

Despite being quite a trendy place, it doesn't stop them being great with our young kids. Our experience is better than the current average of reviews would suggest. I'd recommend giving osteria a try.",
