    "text": "There are lots of good reasons to visit The Sheip's Heid.   Firstly, it's the oldest pub in in Scotland, having been set up in a former guise during the 14th century. It also houses one of the few surviving skittle alleys, and parties can rent this out by the day or for 10 per hour. Being located in sleepy Duddingston also gives favour to this place; there's a gentle, relaxed feel inside which is a reflection of the neighbouring community. Duddingston Loch too, is a 5 minute walk away. Friendly staff are used to tourists & newcomers and will happily give directions or reccommend a fine malt or ale.   The one problem people seem to have with The Sheep's Heid is getting there. As you'll see on the map, reaching the pub from the city centre means taking a great detour round Arthur's Seat. The bus links aren't great, with the 41 only coming twice an hour. As such, going for a quick pint there can seem like a military operation. My solution? Incorporate it into a bigger day out. If, for instance, you go up Arthur's Seat first, the route to the pub becomes pretty direct! You could also go for a walk round the Loch first, to earn your supper.   It's well worth it, because the wonderful atmosphere shouldn't be denied to anyone.",

Waitress came, took our order...we got a free bottle of champagne (sign up to their newsletter for the birthday coupon). But an hour later, we call our waitress, who in that time had not come to check on us or offer more drinks even though people seated long after us had been served their meals and we had a visibly pregnant woman with us! Turns out that our order never went through!!! Needless to say, we were very disappointed in the waitress and the quality of service (she seriously didn't even seem to care). Can't believe that no one noticed esp as it was a quiet Tuesday! We ended up getting the food 1.5 hrs after ordering drinks! However, management comped us use of the skittles alley, the ambiance of the inn and alley were nice, and my food (got the steak) was pretty good and reasonably priced. Skittles was a wonderful time...definitely recommend it!! It's a bit out of the way from Edinburgh central (Nicolson St) in terms of buses, but a lovely 0.5 hr walk around the park. Good if you like historic pubs and want to experience skittles!",

The service was slowwwwwwwwwww.zzzzzzz The waiters/ waitresses forgot which tables had ordered and which hadn't as they were asking after 30mins of nothing, 'would you like anything else?' . Anything first would be good thanks.  We ordered crab cocktail and garlic and chilli butter prawns. The starters we not too bad, but the prawn dish was swimming in oil (not butter). The mains were absolutely awful. My boyfriend is allergic to bread, so ordered the skinny lamb burger' which arrived very burned and falling apart, dry and sitting on a couple of lettuce leaves, that was it. They charged 10.95 for this. I had the mullet. So tasteless and rubbery that I sent it back.  We sat for ages with dirty plates and menus on the table, and all I wanted to do was leave.  I would suggest going for a drink if you want to see the place but stay well clear of the food!!",

Just be warned that many of the letters have been mixed up between boxes and zzzzz isn't allowed as a word!   The beer festivals are the best I have been to in Edinburgh and whilst mainly bottled this results in less settling problems. In the summer, I highly recommend the barbecue that serves burgers and sausages from nearby Findlay's of Portobello.   My only gripe that prevents me giving 5* is that the food in the restaurant can be slow although its excellent quality pub food.",

I first came here back in 2004 and I'm pleased to say very little has changed...as you'd insist with the oldest pub in Edinburgh.   As far as the visit on Sunday just past...I'm  happy to say that my order of a pint of Guinness and a white wine at 12.29pm was not effected by the barkeep until 12.30pm (take note Licensing, Customs & Excise inspectors!) and my wanting a table for three upstairs for lunch was warmly received even though I had not booked prior.   The staff were more than accommodating of us and of our young son and the meals, huge! I partook of the bean casserole with chorizo and crusty bread (totally yum-ola!) and my wife's steak & guest ale pie looked and wafted a treat...and according to the report back from the other side of the table, very tasty (& yes I did manage a cheeky taste of it and in my limited capacity, all ok from me too).  I'd love to bore you with the fantastic history of the pub (wars, deception, deal making, intrigue...and sheep husbandry) and of the village of Duddingston (all of the above) but I'll not put you through it. Suffice to say this pub is a hidden gem within Edinburgh located amongst beautiful surrounds and vista at the base of a (pretty magnificent) rock...superb!",

The entire downstairs has been redone and now looks more like a fancy gastro-pub. No, no, don't cry! I promise there is still enough of ye olde Shepe Heid Inn in there. The carpet downstairs has a lovely little tartan in beige and white (it looked soft enough to pet) and the dust has been cleared and the air has been cleaned (thank you, on behalf of my asthma, thank you). Bathrooms repainted, walls have been redone, the wood's been cleaned and polished and there are candles on the tables. It looks so absolutely beautiful and slightly romantic that I'd be happy spend the majority of my evenings in there.   You know what, ... it kind of has that Christmassy atmosphere. You know the one? Where everything inside looks cosy and warm and inviting without Elfs having vomited Christmas cheer all over the damned place? (Sorry, sorry, couldn't control myself there).  I've not tried any of the drinks or food yet, but I'd be surprised if the standard's gone down. It just looks a lot fancier, and a lot ... more inviting now. Strangely enough.  Even though my supreme large reading chair (of Doom, yes) is gone, I can forgive them for the fact that they vacuumed. All-in-all, I shall be back!",

    "text": "I love this pub. Found in Duddingston Village, the walk around Arthur's Seat is good enough to warrant a few stars but the pub itself deserves the full 5. Claiming to be the oldest pub in Scotland (and dating from 1360 it probably is), the Sheep Heid retains a traditional pub atmosphere but manages to avoid the trap of alienating young people because of this. The clientele are a mix of young and old, and each are catered for in equal measure.  There is a good selection of guest ales, that rotate every so often, so you can always be guaranteed to have a new brew to wet your whistle. There is an excellent selection of Malt Whiskies, with different strengths and flavours to suit all palates.   And that's not all. Upstairs, the food is probably the best you can get in an Edinburgh pub. With their recently updated menu you can now add a duck and orange salad to the traditional steak pies, fidget pie and excellent burgers and fish and chips. The starters are much better than you would expect from normal pub food, with the best being the fish cakes and the salmon wrapped around cucumber. A starter and a main with a beer or two will cost you less than 20 a head which is pretty reasonable when you bear in mind the quality of the food.  And that's still not all; their beer garden is surrounded by the rest of the pub so you aren't distracted by outside noise when supping. On Wednesdays there is a pub quiz which is always good fun, and you can win about 30 to 50 depending on how many groups are taking part. As well as this they have the only remaining Victorian skittle alley, which can be rented out for parties and is a great way for a group to spend an evening. An extra incentive to come to what is already one of the best pubs in Edinburgh.  And that's all.",

Imagine a pub offering great food!   And did these expectations all live up to the hype? Well, yes they did. The bar is quite traditional inside, with a warm, cosy atmosphere. The ales on offer were all very tempting, and were very reasonably priced. The food as well was not expensive, and the Sheep's Heid menu had an extensive menu for a traditional bar. The beer garden outside looked very nice, slightly too cold for me to use that day, but during the summer it must be great! It also has pub quizzes and live music most weeks!

The server said that is was the policy of this pub to not allow any carryout of food not consumed in the pub.  She said they did not have the items needed to wrap up items ... i.e.. foil, plastic wrap.   Really??  Or was it just that the server could not be bothered?

There are a good number of ales on tap and a lovely outdoor patio in which to sit (when it is not raining).  Although highly recommended in guidebooks, it's off the beaten path enough to not be crowded by tourists.

As the oldest bar in Scotland (built in the 1300s) and a traditional Scottish menu it seemed like the most obvious choice.   After deliberating between the haggis and the fidget pie, I opted for the fidget pie. The pie consists of chunks of bacon cooked in an apricot sauce. However, when it arrived there was an awful lot of puff pastry and not a lot else. The pie was simply served with mash and could have done with vegetables dish or some other side.   Afterwards we went downstairs to sample some Scottish whisky and it's in this area that The Sheep Heid excels. The whisky menu was extensive and had something to suit everytaste. As a non-whisky drinker I plumped for something with undertones of 'caramel shortcake' and I wasn't disappointed with this description. The alcohol prices were very reasonable, but whilst I'd recommend the pub I wouldn't return to the restaurant.",

An Olde Worlde Pub decorated throughout with old photographs, pictures, maps and other things. Located on the South East corner of Holyrood park, great wee place to visit for a pint after a walk around the park or on arthurs seat. Serves traditional pub grub and has a wee beer garden which serves a Barbeque at weekends throughout the summer months. (weather permitting of course.)",

    "text": "This is one of the most atmospheric and charming places that you could drink a beer or two in Edinburgh.   Tucked away on the furthest from town side of Arthur's Seat, it's nestled in the heart of Duddingston Village which is worth a look just for its quaint cobbled streets and rose-lined (in summer) stone houses.   The pub is old. I'm not exactly sure how old. But old. Even by Edinburgh's (old) standards. And inside, it's twisty turny enough, cosy enough, low ceilinged enough to win over the most cynical of olde worlde pub goers. And they have satisfyingly crackling log fires to keep you snug in the dead of frosty winter.   In the summer, they fling the doors wide and turn the back yard into a barbeque venue, chock full of Findlay's finest sausages and burgers a succulent plenty.   They have a great selection of beers, wines, spirits, ciders, sure to keep the fussiest drinker happy. And their food is good honest reliable pub grub at its best.   For those with a short attention span who are less enamoured with their co-drinkers chat, they have a real old-fashioned wooden ten pin bowling alley tucked away at the back of the pub. The only shock horror moment comes when you realise the pins dammit won't reset themselves   This is British pubdom at its best. So earn the reward by taking a turn through Holyrood Park on a brisk autumn / winter / summer day with the Sheep's Heid as your destination. I would be surprised if you regretted it.",

Head down to The Sheep Heid on foot along the road at Duddingston Loch to the village and get some barbecue in you (take some bread for the ducks and swans)!   The barbecue foods your basic pub-grub, their burgers can be a little on the small side and their fancy sausages can come out dry but who cares when you've got a whimsical olde covered beer garden to sun out in, behind a truly British ale pub. Get some local draught for your troubles and make sure its on the cold side!   Never been to the restaurant there but next time we're there for barbecue we may just end up staying for the evening. This is a real day-out pub.",

    "text": "Somehow I've lived in Edinburgh for 8 years without ever venturing to The Sheep Heid Inn before, mostly because I don't have a car. However, this week, with the two siblings with whom I share a car back in Glasgow both being on holiday, I had unrestricted use of the Clio so it was brought through to Edinburgh and I've basically been driving everywhere to get some practice.  Yesterday we went for a lovely drive round Arthur's Seat and ended up in Duddingston. Finally making it here, after so many years, it seemed silly not to pop by The Sheep Heid for a drink.  Obviously, being the driver, I wasn't able to sample anything more exciting than a diet Pepsi, but my sister and boyfriend both opted for the more unusually named offers on draught - Mad Goose and Shark Bite (or something Shark anyway). The former was delicious - not too hoppy but with enough of a flavour to give it some body - but the latter was a little disappointing (or at least the small sip of it I had was). I love a cool, light and refreshing lager, but this Pilsner was a bit meh. Maybe the rest of the pint was better, as I didn't hear any complaints.  The inside was busy, as we'd arrived bang on teatime, but the outside courtyard is pleasant with wrought-iron tables and chairs and a covered area with comfier seats (useful when it started to rain!).  The interior looked very nice though, in keeping with its oldest pub in Scotland tag. On that, by the way, it's worth noting that whilst there has apparently been a pub of sorts on the premise since 1360, the present building is much newer (though still about 200 years old).  We didn't eat, but the food looked and smelled okay. I was a bit perplexed by the prices though - the starters and desserts were on the cheaper end (3/4) but the mains were distinctly averagely priced (9/11).  Maybe it deserves 4 stars, but it's hard to tell at the moment. They didn't have a great selection on draught (or at least, not a great selection of anything interesting) and whilst the inside is nice, it's nothing massively special when you consider other Scottish pubs in Edinburgh.  It is nice though, and would be treat to reward yourself with at the end of a walk or drive through the park. I'll be back I imagine (mostly cos I want to try the 19th century skittles alley!), but I won't be hurrying here.",

It came highly recommended by our Airbnb host, which is why we planned our hike to end specifically at the Sheep's Heid. We got our drinks as normal, and about an hour into our meal, the fire alarm went off -- which we know is accidental. However, after getting situated back in the pub, we waited for an hour until we finally had to ask our waitress where our food was. She coldly and unapologetically told us that it would be 20 more minutes until it would be ready, EVEN THOUGH THE OTHER TABLES (who sat down long after us) HAD RECEIVED THEIR FOOD. We were alone in the restaurant when we ordered. The worst part was she and her manager were completely incompetent, unapologetic and frankly rude. We ended up canceling our food order and leaving feeling starving and upset. I don't often take the time to write a Yelp review, but we had to take the time to tell you just how TERRIBLE our experience was here. They clearly couldn't care less about their customers.",

The pub has a decent bar, but we were in to eat so grabbed a table in one if the dining areas.  We were served with a smile and chose the fish and chips and a goats cheese salad which arrived about 10 minutes later.  I have to say I thought the food was fairly average.  The fish seemed heavy with fat, and the goats cheese salad lacked imagination - a handful of green leaves with a lump of goat's cheese dumped on top.    Just a small improvement wih the food would see this place elevated to 'real gem' status and make it worth the trek out of town to visit.  On this evidence they've got a bit to go though so I'd pop in for a passing pint but there are better eateries closer to home.",

    "text": "I have come here several times now, and must say I really like it.  Having lived most of my life in the countryside, going to a cosy pub or cafe was the reward at the end of a long walk. Edinburgh is great at providing instant satisfaction, but sometimes it's nice to go through the ordeal of facing the elements, in exchange for a nice reward.   Most times I have been to the Sheep Heid Inn, I have really come face to face with the Scottish weather. To get to Duddington, one must walk around the foot of arthur's seat, a passage, a path that is often blasted with gail force winds which feel like continuous slaps across the face, made even more severe by the hail, drizzle, or whatever else Scotland feels like throwing at you. Aside from this, it's a pleasant walk. Arthur's seat is beautiful, and you will see the loch at Duddingston before actually reaching the village.  I advise you to walk a little around the cobblestone streets before entering the pub. There's a cute little church overlooking the loch, which is itself quite a stage to the spectacle of elegant swans. You may think you just stepped into Hogsmeade? Not so far off. Apparently this little village influenced even J.K.Rowling.  The pub prides itself in being the oldest in Scotland. Inside, it does feel a little more modern than one might expect, but it still retains a certain charm. Arriving after a wee walk in the cold is a massive relief. Though the quality of the drinks is great, they are a bit pricier here than elsewhere. I have had some good cider and gin and tonics here over the years, and came here for New Years eve for two years running. There's a skittles alley, a VERY difficult pub quiz, and a area reserved to dining upstairs.  I am yet to try the food, but it looks very good went put out on the plate!",

    "text": "This. Place. Is. Amazing. It claims to be Scotland's oldest pub, and it's easy to see why it's still in business since 1360.  This place is just far enough out of the city centre that you can justify spending a whole afternoon or evening there, but close enough that almost everyone you ask will know about it or have been at least once.  From the outside, it looks just like any given old man's pub, serving real ales and home-cooked food. Nothing surprising so far. But when you get inside the place has a surprisingly young and laid back crowd, with an atmosphere to match.  The food is way better than you'd expect in most pubs, although it is slightly pricer. For your money though, you get decent-sized portions and according to the menu certain ingredients like the sausages are sourced locally, so you can feel proud of yourself for helping out local farmers/butchers in the process of stuffing your face with bangers and mash.  I'm not a real ale drinker, in fact I'm about as far in the opposite direction as you can go, and there's definitely a good range of spirits and wines to cater for the likes of me. They stock ginger beer to go with my gin for a start, instead of watery ginger ale that a lot of places have.   But saving the best 'til last... they still have the original Victorian skittles alley out the back which you can hire out. Most pubs are doing well with a pool table or an it-box, but this definitely trumps a dartboard and I'd highly recommend it.",

Firstly, they were playing Johnny Cash's Unearthed album, which was so nice to hear from us as we are from the American South and we were in Scotland on vacation. Secondly, the staff was just so friendly. We chatted with the bartender about music and beer. The decor was really cozy. I hear the place had recently been remodeled, but it seemed quite homey looking in there to us. The food was really amazing! We were there during lunch, and I had the marinated sticky chicken in lemon, honey & chilli sauce. It really was extremely good. My husband had slow-cooked British beef & Black Sheep Ale pie with thyme carrots & British summer cabbage mash. We enjoyed their beer selection. Scottish beer is my favorite and we can't find it in the U.S. Many people were sitting outside and enjoying the lovely sunny day. As Florida natives, we were happy to skip the sunshine and enjoy the ambiance and the friendly staff inside. I really enjoyed our meal and our experience there. The next time I am in Edinburgh, I will definitely be back! Duddingston is a quaint and lovely little village.",

You can climb it if you want- it does have spectacular views from the top and provides the feeling of self accomplishment. However you can also walk around it and head towards the village of Duddingston. There are a variety of routes to reach the village, either following the road , from which you will get to see Duddingston Loch, or under via the Innocent Cycle Path or even over Arthur's Seat.  Once you arrive at the village head towards the famous Sheep's Heid Inn- the \"oldest public House of Scotland\" (from 1360!). It was thought to be the stopping place for travellers and royalty going between Holyrood and Craigmillar Castle. Here you will find a good selection of beers and ales and other drinks (much needed after the walk) as well as food. The pub is like a treasure trove, with various memorabilia left from previous visitors-so take your time to have a look around(I surely did), as well as board games you are welcome to use.    There is also a cute beer garden in the back if you are lucky with the weather, and do not miss out on taking a look at the old skittle alley- ask a member of staff to let you in if you can't find it. Skittles is like an early form of bowling and the Inn is quite popular for it, so it is usually hard to book a slot. There is a large variety of food to choose from, from tourist favourites of haggis and other Scottish delicacies to lighter options. On Sunday's there is also a roast which tends to get quite popular (call to book in advance!) and around spring and the summer there are various barbeques and beer festivals (check their website for more details: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sheepheid.co.uk%2Fhistory.html&s=2a6d8d37feff7e89108cb367c58d58d51c1d952738fc430f4a9c036323de422e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">sheepheid.co.uk/history....</a>). Prices are on the verge of affordable, but one is really visiting this place for its ambience. I always take visiting friends here as a sort of \"outing\".   Although the food can be quite stodgy and heavy I would highly recommend this place to any visitor or resident of Edinburgh who wants to let go of the city and get a feel of an \"authentic\" pub-a cosy place whatever the weather may be!",

There was a little drama over our orders, as not that many  bartenders are accustomed to mixing Guinness with coke!   The most surprising aspect of the trip was how large and modern the bathrooms our; they would do any hotel proud! If the Sheepsheid was a little bit closer, I'd probably visit more often!",

Duddingston is a lovely wee part of Edinburgh, and for those on the tourist trail (and locals, who are not), The Sheep Heid Inn offers more than most. However, Sundays are mental crazy busy - too much for me. We took the parents here, and were crammed into a corner for Sunday lunch. The various meals we had... none of us really got that excited about them - lacking in flavour and generally just... meh. I wouldn't rush back to be honest, it's definitely for me, style over substance but perhaps on a quieter night I would have a different impression.",

It amounts to glitzed up gastro pub but the atmosphere is rather homey and lovely and its location makes it almost the only game in town. I really love the fish and chips and they do cater for vegetarians with more than just the usual suspects. My husband had the veg haggis with neeps and tatties and loved it. The draught beer is always excellent and the beer garden is nice in warmer weather. I love the skittles hall and generally the walk there after a trot around Dr Neill's Gardens or Holyrood Park is the perfect Sunday but you should book. It's super busy on a Sunday because everyone had the same idea.",

    "text": "Stopped by on a Sunday afternoon after a gorgeous walk up and over Arthur's Seat.  The place was packed, even as it was well past lunch time. Nevertheless their staff were polite and accommodating. It seems rare these days to find a pub that can serve so many people professionally without being flustered.   The fish and chips was quite good, the Sunday roast was significantly better than we would have expected, and the beer selection was ample.  The food isn't 5 star, but it is very good for a pub and considering the location, the atmosphere, the staff, and the lovely afternoon we had there I can't give it less than 5 stars.  So make a day of it: climb Arthur's Seat, enjoy the views, dine at the Sheep Heid, and walk off the Sticky Toffee Pudding as you wind your way back to Edinburgh.  Oh, and while I'm not sure this would be True every day, last Sunday the background music selection was perfect for fans of pop music between 1994 and 1996.",

    "text": "I've always really enjoyed a trip to the Sheep Heid, especially after a walk up Arthur's Seat.  What is it about walking that makes you really want a beer? Is it a UK thing, or a Scottish thing?  Is it because you've just done something healthy, you must counteract it?   And man does that beer taste good after a long walk.  It makes me want to go walking this weekend so I can tuck into a few well deserved pints.    Anyway .... I have always really enjoyed coming here for pints.  The best bit, in my opinion, is in the summer when they have the BBQ on.  They even have amazing beer festivals here and when you combine beer festival with BBQ and sun, you have my perfect weekend.    My guy and I are house hunting at the moment and last weekend I looked at a house about 8 minutes walk from here.  My guy wasn't too keen on the house itself and I was like \"but then we would live withing really really close walking distance to the Sheep Heid and the beer and the barbeque and the beer and the beer!!!\"  He was not convinced that my argument was strong enough to buy a house there.  Pff.    The only downside is the tourist trade.  Dastardly tourists take up lots of space in this place, but at least they have good taste.",

    "text": "I love this place. Officially the oldest pub in Scotland!  After a long post Christmas walk up and around Arthur's seat we needed some grub. We had visited the Sheep's Heid before so we knew we would get something good.   Nestled down a cobbled street in Duddingston, The Sheep's Heid is the cutest Inn you ever did see. Inside is super cosy and welcoming. We walk into the bar and the friendly staff show us to a table in the back. This pub looks small but it can hold quite a few tables!  The lighting is dim and the chairs are super comfy, after a couple of pints you could easily drift off into a slumber. We look at the menu and David does his usual and goes for the burger. I decide upon the seabass. The food doesn't take long and we are soon tucking in.   My seabass is beautifully cooked and came with delicious vegetables and dressing. David's burger must have been good as he seemed to inhale it! We are both too full for a dessert even though they do sound amazing.  Lunch cost about 30 but that was with a drink each as well, not bad at all. A great place to bring the family to or just hanging out on a Sunday. I am desperate to try their Sunday roast!  If you have the energy afterwards you can play a game of proper old fashioned skittles, they have an alley in the back. Just ask the guys at the bar.  A definite winner for me!  Cheers, Amy",

I've been going to the Sheep Heid on and off for 10-12 years now.  It's a lovely, charming venue and it's a fun place to show off when I've got guests visiting Edinburgh.  There's good beer on tap as well.  Over time, I do feel that there's been a gradual but increasingly noticeable decline in the quality of the food and service.  It's basically 20-25 a head for a main and a drink, and other places in the same bracket (e.g. Spoon, the Outsider) have much more interesting, better quality options.  The food isn't bad per se, just kind of standard meals at a high price, kind of like an airport pub.  There's lots of choice from various international options to traditional pub fare.  In fact, I wonder if having too much choice is part of the problem - it's a really big menu, and perhaps a narrower set of options would allow a focus on either a) some really impressive high quality options or b) the current stuff at a more reasonable price.  Service is fair to middling.",

We booked for 4 people at 1:30pm, the table was waiting for us upon arrival and we're welcomed by friendly front of house Kelsie. The place was rather busy as all tables were pre-booked. We ordered some drinks (alcohol free beers, Caesar Augustus ale and some orange juice) As per starters we had two soups of the day, Stilton & Mushroom with artisan rustic bread & butter, Salt & Szechuan Pepper Squid followed by Cod & chips, Wagyu Burger with extra bacon, child portion Fish Goujon and a Duck Salad as mains.  And here's when all kicked off... we were served by a tall dude who looked spaced out/in the zone and by waitress Kelsie & a bearded waiter as a back-up... Tall Dude took the drink orders, but they never arrived...until we re-asked to Bearded Waiter and ...voila drinks arrived in 1 minute... After a 25 minutes wait our starters arrived; the Stilton & Mushroom soups were a terrible disappointment as they did not taste of Stilton or mushrooms either, they were certainly not creamy and they looked more like some green over diluted salty stock...or dirty warm water... To top it up, Tall Dude got catering lesson 1.0.1 wrong as he did not do the mise-en-place...AKA forgot to bring spoons....we asked him for them to no avail so I started to drink it from the bowl, camping style... when we got the attention of Bearded Waiter we got the spoons in a second... After finishing our almost edible starters, we ordered a second round of drinks to Tall Dude; who of course did not deliver...after 5 minutes we got Kelsie and she brought our drinks in a good timely fashion, thank goodness. After a long wait for our mains, Tall Dude appeared with all our mains; but guess what ... catering lesson 1.0.2 was missed too as he forgot to clear the empty bowls & plates from the starters to make room...anyhow... My mate's Cod & Chips was a 5/10 experience while my Wagyu Burger was good enough; so it was the Duck Salad (7/10). Pros: Kelsie & Bearded Waiter, the atmosphere, the pub interiors. Cons: the food & the Tall Dude appalling non-existent service. Plenty room for improvement as you may guess...but it won't be me testing if that happen (or not)... any time soon....",

I ordered the Trio Sunday Roast (beef, chicken, and pork, and the typical potatoes, vegetables, and Yorkshire pudding) and enjoyed it. It was just the right portions for me as well, with room for a bit of desert. I had the mini-rasberry creme brulee and a capacino which were particularly nice.  Everything was above average, and met my expectation as set by the fellow who recommended it to me. I will return if ever I get the chance.  As a bonus, the family sitting at the table next to mine had several charming youngsters who had just learned to clink glasses and exclaim \"Cheers!\" It made for a lively and very cheerful dinner time for me. I can highly recommend you arrange to arrive at about the same time as them and get a table nearby.  Cheers!",

When I went I was able to grab a seat in the beer garden, before it became really busy, and was able enjoy the sun (yes sun in Edinburgh). Then myself and a friend went inside to have some good food. I don't think you're allowed to have food out in the beer garden, though there is a small balcony area upstairs where it looked like you can have food. There's a good mix of clientele from families to groups of friends out for a few drinks. They had a guy singing in the beer garden yesterday which was a nice touch. He did covers of what I consider to be chilled out songs which suited the atmosphere of the place.   There is also the skittles alley which I've yet to try, but I've heard great things about it so it's definitely on my list of things to do. Great pub!",

    "text": "The Sheep Heid is our local so we've been in quite a few times & it's a lovely little gastro pub, with a good atmosphere & above average food.  During the week it's great for an after-work drink & after a couple of glasses of wine I'll inevitably crack & order the scallops which are delicious. There's also a great mix of people with local mingling with tourists who've just finished climbing Arthur's Seat.  However, over the weekend it becomes a bit of a nightmare. It ends up being packed & even when we've booked ahead for dinner or lunch, we've been sat in a cramped corner surrounded by people, which doesn't exactly make for a great dining experience. We also found the Sunday lunch to be pretty disappointing considering the overall good quality of the food.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend a trip to the Sheep Heid whether you're a visitor or an Edinburgh local, but avoid the weekend!",

How cool for an American to eat in a pub that has been in service since 1360!  We had a bottle of wine, salmon, and roast.  All very good, and a very nice walk from downtown.  We climbed Arthur's Seat on the way back to walk off the meal.  When it came time to pay the check, they comped me as a birthday present!  Can't wait to go back and actually pay for my meal!",

    "text": "This place is the perfect country pub - but you don't have to drive out to the country. Very cosy with great staff (though maybe a bit mental). Always got a couple great Real Ales. Good bar menu, we had the steak frites and the burger, both were great value for money. freshly ground coffees also, and we shared a chocolate brownie, BOOM! This is what pub lunches are all about, don't look anywhere else.  Also, don't forget, beer garden, beer festival, separate restaurant, child and dog friendly, skittle alley.... I HEART The Sheep Heid!!",
