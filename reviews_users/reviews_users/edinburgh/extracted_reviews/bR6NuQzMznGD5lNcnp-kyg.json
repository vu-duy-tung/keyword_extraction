Friend had their organic earl grey and we both have freshly made fruit smoothies.  I'd definitely go back for another. Didn't have food but whatever they were cooking smelled great. Sadly though the open kitchen meant I came away smelling of food too though for the rest of the day.",

The guy who served me on my first visit must have been feeling particularly generous or he was new. - He gave me more salad for a much cheaper price.   I've now learnt that the salad prices are similar to anywhere else in the area. - I'll still visit just not as often as I'd like!",
