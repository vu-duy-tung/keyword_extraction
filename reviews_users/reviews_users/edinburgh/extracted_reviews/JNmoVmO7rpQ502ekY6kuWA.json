It was really special. Beans were unsweetened, bacon was perfect, everything on the plate was really clean and not greasy.   If you follow the paleo diet, this place would also work ok for you too because they keep refined sugar out of their food. Also dairy free and vegan options available.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed Gram's and here's why. I had been stalking them on social media prior to the opening. I had seen the whole raw and gluten free focus they had and had been intrigued to see how good this would be. Plus it was around a 10 min walk from Chez Moi so perfect.  The whole raw thing tends to be associated with being vegan in an uber healthy kind of way. I'm used to the whole vegan-gluten free thing but sometimes I want healthy food thats not necessarily vegan or vegetarian. Gram's totally fit the bill in this respect.  The cakes look and taste amazing with many vegan and gluten free options so nice tick in the box. Some cool flavoured sodas are also available. I was hungry though so I went for one of the salads but loved that these weren't pure vegetables and you could get chicken, beef or salmon too. Yum, huge portion with (for me) lots of salmon and rainbow colours of veggies. I felt super healthy having a lovely balanced meal. I couldn't resist without trying the cake so got a strawberry & cream cheesecake which was beautiful.   I was probably around 13 for my salad, soda and cake. There's not a huge amount of seats so you may have to lurk until someone leaves although take away is available.  Great addition to Haymarket with lovely options and helpful staff if you have dietary requirements and need to double check what is suitable.",

    "text": "I'm really looking forward to seeing Grams grow. There aren't any cafes trying to do specifically what Grams are and it's great that they've gone and got their own shop unit. I was delighted to see them selling out Stockbridge market and providing their delicious raw, vegan, gluten free bakes to health shops and cafes across the city. The fact that it has been maintained till now as a one man operation makes the whole thing even more amazing. And I know Grams is going to rock the Edinburgh health scene.  I visited on the first day trading and, of course, my eyes went straight to the cake fridge. If you haven't seen Grams' cakes, they are immaculate; almost too good to eat. Their infamous raw snickers is really a delight and just bursting with goodness. It feels so indulgent and rich and yet, there's no nasties; no refined sugar, lots of nuts and fruits and natural sweetness. For me, this is where Grams smashes it. The raw snickers will forever hold a place in my heart. FOREVER.  The tester menu was varied with juices, the raw cakes, soups and healthy lunch options. And matcha lattes. What a dream. The matcha latte was delicious, with a lovely foamy top. I had the butternut and orange soup and that was delicious too, with the orange flavour really coming through. It was just 2.95 for a large bowl and an additional 25p for sourdough! I'd have happily paid a pound or two more as the quality was great.  I understand that Grams has had to explain, to some disappointment and confusion, that they aren't intending to be a strictly vegan or gluten free cafe. With the cakes all being gluten free and vegan, a lot of people with these intolerances and lifestyle changes will come in. I think it would only be fair to cater to these people for food too. I didn't notice these on the tester menu but I hope that Grams decides to develop this side of their menu. My boyfriend's mum pointed out that the sign inside is a little misleading. It says clean, raw, vegan but this only applies to the cakes. I think it was the sign that's used at the market stand which only sells cakes.  Outside, there is a large sign, which says 'Edinburgh's first naked cafe' in the sense that is using only unprocessed and whole ingredients. My boyfriend had a dish with chicken and chorizo. Afterwards, we thought on this and concluded that chorizo just didn't sit right on the menu considering that it is a processed meat. He very much enjoyed the meal but, as I said, thought it just didn't sit right, and I do agree with him. I do enjoy non-clean foodie things but I would really enjoy the experience of eating at an entirely clean establishment. I do get the sense that vegans and vegetarians coming here for the cakes would be a little disheartened at seeing meat and fish on the lunch menu too. Perhaps the option to add these instead would sit a little better. As a non-vegan, I, like many others, do enjoy eating in vegan restaurants and, considering the success of the cakes, it is worth weighing things up. Although, I can see that they're really trying to cater to everyone.  Grams is finding its feet and I'm really keen to follow its journey and see their menu develop. For their first day trading I was super impressed with the quality. And good on them for keeping their prices on the low side. I'd love to see some smoothies, with healthy energy boosters like maca, included on the menu. I'm so excited for what's to come. - This is just the beginning for Grams. As always, those raw bakes steal the show.   Drool.",
