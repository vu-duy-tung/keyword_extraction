I have been a couple of times and cannot fault the food. They have a special weekend menu with all day breakfasts and every variation on that. The food great, but they prices aren't cheap. Also, because it is so busy, you can't really stay at the table for long, as there's always new people arriving looking to be seated. The Olive Branch locate their ingredients locally, so the sausages are from the fine butcher next door, Crombies, and the menu shows where other items came from. So you know you are getting quality. One other slight criticism is there is no cheaper menu on weekday lunches. So a Monday lunchtime costs the same as a Saturday night. The prices are fine for an evening but better value is available elsewhere at lunchtimes.",

The website states that there is a 10% discount for those making a reservation but if they don't respond to your on-line reservation request they won't honor the discount either. Fair enough.  I would advise that you reserve on-line and then call them if you don't receive a response. Once you are there, even if you can describe every step of their own reservation process, the waitress will give you her best snotty smirk and shake her head no.

When I came in last week to catch up with a friend I couldn't help but eye up the delicious looking club sandwich that the guy next to me had, it looks amazing and was served with the crispest, freshest looking side salad I've ever seen. Very well presented and it looked so good that I was tempted to snatch a triangular shaped piece for myself!  Next time I'm definitely getting food!",

A Bistro type atmosphere and food menu is great when you just want something chilled, and maybe spur of the moment, but you're not feeling quite as laidback as pub food or a cafe. You basically feel like you've gone for dinner, but without a lot of the fuss that can entail, such as having to make a slight effort to look in the mirror and check you're looking acceptable to human eyes. Sometimes quite an effort, I'm sure you'd agree.  Anyway, this is a relaxed environment to dine in, with an all round pleasing breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner menu. I had the sea bream and polenta last time I was in, which was really good, followed by some cheese cake, my favourite dessert of them all. Afterwards, there's the bonus of having some Broughton St bars to go to if you fancy.",

If I could have my own little Olive Branch Bistro in my shed then I would!  It is very nice and really classy inside. This ain't no greasy spoon, although each and every time I have went (usually early morning when I have looked better, I have to admit) I have been greeted in a really friendly manner by waitresses who are familiar and chatty without appearing aloof. I have the same thing every time I come, smoked salmon with scrambled eggs and toast, which is simply delicious and beats some soggy cold toast on the run any day. It isn't the cheapest brekkie at almost 6, but that coupled with a lovely hot cup of English breakfast tea will be amongst the best 8 meals you have ever had.   I've seen the weekend breakfast menu which is twice the size with twice the choice, and I'm just waiting until a Sunday comes where I am not hungover to give it a try.",

But I had always wanted to try it, if only to sit in the window with the great views across Broughton St from the floor to ceiling glass.   I had my tummy set on a Treacle burger so I went for that here and it was quite good. Homemade burger patties, which is nice, and it had some good flavour but I did have to spit out at least five bits of knobbly gristle ... charming. I think they need to trim their beef a bit more before putting it through the mincer, or just reduce the amount of ears and noses in the burger mix. But it tasted good and came on a lovely brown roll with nice chunky chips and a salad garnish. I normally prefer skinny fries with a burger but these were cooked beautifully and hit the spot nicely. I was particularly impressed that the burger came on a brown roll and I wish more places at least gave you that option. More flavour, texture and character than most white burger buns which run the gamut from limp wispy efforts to chalky doughy monsters. So the burger was quite nice all round but not up to Treacle's standards and possibly a wee bit expensive at over ten pounds.  Their Bloody Mary sounded interesting, made with Absolut pepper vodka and a dash of Tio Pepe sherry, but unfortunately it wasn't really to my taste. That's a personal thing so fair enough, but I also feel it should be served in a nicer glass than your standard tall water glass. If they're extracting six quid out of you for what is basically a glass of juice and a shot of booze then at least make it look worth the price.  So. Nice staff, great location, especially if you can snag a window seat and they have a generally good menu. Gillian loved her food, so even though mine wasn't quite top drawer, I would happily go back. I was thinking of the food as solid 3.5 stars so wasn't sure which way to go, but I bumped them up to 4 stars purely for the brown roll.",

Inside it's not a very large space and the tables are pretty close together, I don't really mind this so much as meals here tend to be intimate tete a tete kind of affairs - I'm not sure I would come here with a large group of people.

    "text": "Currently ranked #25 best restaurant in the world according to me.  During my second trip to Edinburgh, I finally took the plunge and stopped in for dinner, even though no one had ever specifically recommended Olive Branch. But I had stood outside perusing the menu posted near the entryway several times before and eventually had a reckoning.   Inside, Olive Branch is modern and carefully designed with high ceilings, a full bar, exposed, and has the menu written in chalk on one of the walls. It's cozy inside with relatively few tables, maybe 10 or fewer.  The menu looked inspired and, best of all, it was simplified down to only a handful of dishes - a good sign. We went with the grilled asparagus appetizer [A+], which was super fresh and delicious with a novel flavor mix of micro greens, pea puree, and pickled fennel.   For the main course, I ordered the roasted lamb rump. This was served with pea puree again, parsnip crisps, and lentils. Everything about this dish was exquisite. The lamb was soft and well seasoned with incredible sauce. The lentils were nicely seasoned and cooked perfectly. (Usually, this is where restaurants really cut corners.) My dad ordered the ribeye, which tried and scored as an [A].  For dessert, I did the marshmallow and dark chocolate cheesecake, which was to die for [A+].  Overall, they did everything exceptionally well. Our server was upbeat, truly knowledgeable about the food, and on-point with our food and drink. Each dish showed me that both the quality of the food was superior as was the detail and thought put into its preparation. I was stunned. Wow...",

I love trying new places and different types of food, especially things I don't know how to cook myself but every once in a while you don't feel like cooking and just want a good, solid meal at a decent price.  Olive Branch has always come through for us whether for Breakfast/Brunch, Lunch and Dinner.  They do the basics very well.  Really nice fish and chips - well cooked chunky chips, a big fillet of cod (not the whole fish like in a chippie but still a good thick portion) and great tartar sauce.  For lunch, their club sandwich is always satisfying as is their full breakfast. Friendly service, cosy atmosphore and a jug of water (with mint and lemon) for every table adds a nice touch.  You may not be wowed with the next foodie trend but you won't be disappointed either.",

I got a glass of the 175mL Chenin blanc from South Africa which was passable. A semi-sweet, the flavor was lacking. The halloumi and aubergine moussaka with spiced chickpea and carrot on the side though made up for it. While not amazing, the rich gravy with the salty/firm halloumi taste and texture was still solid. My husband got rabbit rilette and said it was fine. However, his eyes rolled back in joy at the Eton mess. The berries and whipped cream with the merengue blended wonderfully together (I had a spoonful).   Nice servers as well which rounded out the pleasant experience.",

For mains we had halloumi, chilli jam and rocket salads, stuffed aubergines and chips plus a delicious bottle of Trebbiano wine. Our food was amazing and the service was friendly, relaxed and helpful. Our waiter kindly advised us that one portion of breads would be enough between three people as a starter. This saved us from ordering two, which would indeed have been a waste as the bread starter is massive and easily serves three. It's a beautifully decorated little bistro in shades of olive green and white with wooden tables and some outdoor seating. We had a delightful, relaxed lunch here and would have stayed much longer if we hadn't flights to catch.",

Lots of big windows on the outside to let the evening sun filter through the windows as you relax and watch the world go by. A busy bustling restaurant, which was almost full when we arrived; I'm glad we had booked, as the last few tables went within half an hour. Our table was right in the centre of the restaurant adjacent to the small but well-stocked bar. The person serving us was apparently only on his second day at the Bistro, but you couldn't tell, he was a natural, helpful and friendly, with the appropriate amount of banter.  Menu wise, we went straight for the main courses, a couple of us had the fish and chips, the fish was beer battered, so fresh and tasty, with hand cut chips and pea puree. I resisted my urge to immediately try the burger in any restaurant that has one, and went for the special of fettuccine with courgettes, leeks and toasted pine nuts in a cream sauce, not the biggest portion but full of flavour. My wife had the Lamb Goulash with lemon and chilli infused rice, and sour cream. The last dish of Sea Bream, with Provencal potatoes, French beans and anchovy butter, was probably the pick of a very impressive set of mains, a perfectly cooked piece of fish, with great accompanying sides.  Obviously it would be rude not to have a dessert, the Mixed Berry Eton Mess was very tasty, but a little light on meringue and heavy on the cream. The trio of Ice Creams also was a good dessert, because of the level of choice on offer.  Good food, great service, candles set into the back wall to give atmosphere and inventive paintings of figures of popular culture, which kept me guessing for the whole meal about the identity of the last picture, it was a young Mick Jagger apparently.",

But I soon learned that you don't have to be to dine at the Olive Branch Bistro - they have a varied enough menu to suit all palates!  For a bistro it's very fancy, as the girls have mentioned. But you are in an area that would attract people who appreciate fine food and who am I to argue with how awesome their options are? With tasteful, neutral surroundings that are comfy as well as being high class, it really is more like a restaurant, although feels more like a bistro at breakfast time. They do everything from crispy, warm croissants at reasonable prices to massive fry ups (which are actually healthier than most I've pumped into my body in my lifetime), not to mention an abundance of veggie options!  For lunch, they do a variety of dishes that range from meats to seafood. They are on the pricier side but you are paying for quality and the food tastes like it's good for you.   With that in mind, it's the kind of place you can eat in style. With well cooked food that is brimming with nutrients, you shouldn't feel bad for spoiling yourself with a meal from here once in a while.",

And coleslaw, because it's Scotland, and coleslaw is seemingly a legal requirement.   We only ended up in the Olive Branch because Treacle was closed for refurbishment (open again tonight, I think) but it was a really good choice and I'd definitely go back.

Everything salady or wrappy is really tasty, going for things like the burgers or fish n' chips only leads to disappointment. I had some lovely hallumi and chorizo kebabs which I still dream about - things like that are boss but main meals are really just a bit bland.  I've always found the service a wee bit slow and like the staff couldn't care whether you're there or not. Dare ask for a tap water and you're basically one word away from being belted in the face. However, they're always friendly when you walk in.  Great location for shopping folk and people who live on this side of town.",

She brought us this huge jug of water filled with various green bits, which I very much appreciated as we didn't have to ask. Note to other restaurants- bring water to the table! I had a Burger which was juicy and meaty and went down a treat. My Dad munched away on some fish which we was very happy with.
