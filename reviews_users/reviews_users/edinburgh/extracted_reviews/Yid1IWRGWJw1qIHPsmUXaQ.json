    "text": "It hit the spot after a long rainy day. We ended doing take away here after trying to get into hot pot and Italian down the street.   1) wonton soup 3 was solid, a little salty but nothing that can't be fixed by adding some hot water.  2) Singapore fried noodle was decent, but a little mushy. The slivers of meat was tasty and had a few bright shrimps. We got it medium spicy.   Both dishes were a tad more salty than I'd like so maybe ask them to hold back on the salt. Other than that it was good!  If it helps I'm Cantonese Chinese so I know what it's suppose to taste like.",

It is really hard to get authentic cuisine here in Edinburgh as the Chinese population here is not as high as London.  Definitely give this place a try and try what the Cantonese community has to offer.  Staff are really nice and helpful as well.",

    "text": "They do just about everything right here. For one; they focus on the food and what you as a customer would like to eat and how you'd like to eat it. Secondly: No, actually, that is it.   Alcohol license?  They have a 12 seater restaurant, barely space for a cash register. So... Nah.. people will eventually complain about the coldness of their beer, or the off-ness of their wine. Nope, they'll stick with the green Jasmine / Lotus tea and to the food and concentrate on that. You bring in what you like at the temperature you'd like to drink it.   Delivery?  They will not have a driver on standby for you to eventually complain about the lateness and missing items. No no no. If you like the food that is cooked; you will come over and get it yourself. And trust me you will.  I now understand those people that drive for miles to get their perfect hot chocolate served at some obscure farmers' coffee shack. I would be happy to order, jump on a bus and get food from here, if I feel flush I may even pay a taxi to collect and deliver... Heck, I may even visit people I know in the area a bit more to persuade them to do a takeout.   You just swing by or phone up your order. They'll prepare and pack it in front to you so you'll know what you got.  Ordering complicated dishes that take a long time to prepare? Sure you can, just order 24-48 hrs in advance - advice for how many people - and they'll have it ready for your the evening you visit.  The lady that served us knew all about the dishes that were available, supplied recommendations and was in general very friendly, accommodating and extremely helpful. As they are popular they do turn the tables around. We had 2.5 hours on our table, which is more than ample.  Be prepared to get stuck in, eat with your hands and get pretty messy with your meal... (Oh was that just me...?) But they provide napkins, wet towelettes, fingerbowls, etc...  As it is such a small place I don't recommend this for families with young children.  You cannot run around, highchairs, trolleys, car seats etc.. will be in the way and most possibly restrict movement of servers and guests.  They have one toilet and it is down a very(!) steep flight of stairs. If you do insist I'd say book the whole restaurant.  I recommend this place for couples and close group of friends around 6-8 We had a wonderful time and I'd like to thank the B&D Kitchen for having us!",

    "text": "I enjoyed a take away meal from this location on the recommendation of the internet. We got a wide selection and most was great. A few things didn't travel home as well as others. Some highlights were the giant steamed prawns with garlic on the specials menu. The salt and chili chicken was tasty as was the chow mein and sweet and sour chicken. The special fried rice wasn't my favorite, nor were the veggie spring rolls, which I think would have been better in the restaurant, instead of take away. People were absolutely lovely. Would go back again!",

    "text": "Yum, yum, yum!  Just had my first take away from here. I don't eat a lot of take away so it has taken me awhile to get here but I wish I had discovered B&D's earlier!  It is tiny - you can sit in and there is probably space for about 15 people. There is fabulous art work on the walls and there is also byob without charge.  By the looks of things, many mains around 7+ on the menu then add rice, etc for sit in dining. I'm definitely popping in for dinner one night but for the meantime, it was take away.  I had crispy chilli chicken and boiled rice. Plentiful portion and very tasty. Gluten free too which is unusual but great to get the battered stuff as an option. Not overly spicy but suited me. According to the website, special diets not an issue as made fresh to order, separately, which is always a welcome relief. About the 5+ mark for mains to take away (then add sides, etc) but a really budget friendly option for a treat :-)   So B&D's, I'll be back. I'm desperate to eat in with a posse of friends so we can try as much as possible. I also think I'll be eating more take aways too :-)",

    "text": "Easily the best Chinese in Edinburgh at this price or even double.   I don't understand why there are not a million reviews here already! Most likely due to it's location in stupid Dalry. I live in the New Town and even though they don't deliver to me I probably go at least once a week in my car to pick it up. I really think they should move to the New Town simply for my convenience. #firstworldproblems  So the menu is pretty much like your normal Cantonese takeaway except there are a several dishes which really stand out. They are trying to do traditional Cantonese things for the Chinese audience but they also work for more refined British palettes. I think some of the regular dishes are a bit boring, the ones you would find in other Chinese takeaways. I would say this is not a slur on their cooking but they need to provide dishes like this to stay in business as the people that are eating there are not all like me. If they didn't offer a satay like everyone else then people might not order!  Things I like to order :-  Hot sand king prawn, sort of like salt and pepper style but tossed in roasted garlic/onions and chilli Hakka pork or beef Steamed pork belly with yam and fermented bean sauce All the sweet and sours - the shredded chicken and honk kong style are pretty good, beautifully balanced sauce and crispy meat. Also the takeaway tub is literally overflowing with meat and not padded out with onions Oh did I mention that the pak choi is only 5? Normally 9 from other places! If you can think ahead order the crispy pork belly (48 hour wait)  Off menu they are testing a dish which is Beef and bitter melon which I recommend and there are going to be some seafood dishes soon like razor clams and scallops. Also planning dishes with Chinese medicinal ingredients. I tried a lamb dish with angelica root (the second most important gin botanical) which was very good.  So why is this better than any other Chinese you ask? Surely you could not make such an incredulous statement??  Well for takeaway the dishes all average around 5. Even for the prawns and things. It's a family business and they are always happy to cook around any specific orders you require. For example they can use a potato starch if you have any gluten issues with the battered things (salt and pepper, sweet sour, hot sand etc..)  This is Karen Unicorn quality at less than 1/2 the price. I asked them why they don't charge more and you know what they said 'that is a fair price and we think other people charge is too much!' Wow!  Also I found out about this place from stupid tripadvisor. Who would have thought that stupid website would have reviewed such a gem even with no reviews on here!",

    "text": "I can see why this place has been voted best Chinese in Edinburgh!   If it weren't for the fact it's up in Dalry and literally the opposite side of town from me and they don't deliver, I'd probably eat from here once a week.  The Hot Sand dishes are amazingly flavourful and Hakka Beef reminds me of something my granny might make.   The restaurant itself is teeny tiny, so make sure you book if you want to sit in. BYOB with no corkage, so be sure to bring a bottle if you fancy a drink. They seem to do an amazing takeaway trade, so be prepared to have people milling around your table while you dine if you're sitting in.  The 1/2 aromatic duck is delicious and PLENTIFUL as a starter for two people.. (we ended up taking some home to save room for our mains).",

    "text": "Shout out to all Yelpers who love Chinese food - visit B&D's Kitchen ASAP!  I'm sceptic when it comes to Chinese food in Europe, it's never the same as when you are in Asia unfortunately and why I have often avoided it. Until now. Friends persuaded me to go give B&D's Kitchen a go so I did and oh my I wish I had visited earlier..   We started with a selection of homemade dumplings and won tons- both nibblish and tasty (and very hot!) alongside spicy ribs and aromatic duck that was so delicious we could have continued with that all night. But oh no for main courses we had a massive selection of hot sand king prawns, Hakka beef (BOTH A SERIOUS MUST), ginger and spring onion chicken, garlic pak choi (so fresh) accompanied by rice and tasty noodles. So much food, such small tummies... To finish the meal we had refreshing jasmine tea that kept it's delicate flavour and we had kiwi fritters that was so light and delicious we cleared the plate pretty quickly!   This is not your usual Chinese restaurant, it's has fresh and flavoursome ingredients, lovely staff, a nice intimate restaurant and quick service.   Don't be put off by the slightly random location this is the place to go to for tasty Hong Kong Chinese food in Edinburgh! I am definitely a convert.   Go, go, go!",
