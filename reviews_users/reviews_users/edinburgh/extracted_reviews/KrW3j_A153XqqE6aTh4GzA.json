    "text": "For late night fish and chips, it's the most convenient to the Grassmarket pubs (and home for me). Each fish is made fresh for you, and if you don't mind paying an extra 50p or so, go for the 'special batter'. It's more breadcrumb than batter and the extra crispiness puts it above the crowd. Soooo good.  This is just a chippy, sure, but it's _my_ chippy. I love coming in after five or six drams and being greeted like an old friend. Occasionally I'll be offered something new to try, like tasty friend mushrooms and I never turn these morsels of greasy goodness down.   Chip quality is average but the gravy and curry sauce are both top notch, and they'll helpfully put plastic between your fish and chips to keep the sauce from getting on the fish.  Lovely staff!",

Unfortunately, the chips were mushy, like they'd been sitting in a warmer for hours. Not a place we'd visit again.",

    "text": "Probably the worst chippy I've ever been to. The chips were stale and the surly woman who served us made the gravy from bisto granules in front of us. She said it'd be 5 minutes for the fish, then spent the next couple of minutes playing on her phone before even preparing the food. She might have been making fake reviews on yelp because I'm not sure how anyone has liked this place before. Do yourself a favor and skip this place!",

The Fish & Chips here were the best I had out of every city I visited on my trip. The fish was so good! The batter even better, and the chips, well they were just as amazing. This isn't the alcohol talking, I know you are probably thinking anything tastes good when you're a little tipsy, but I'm not lying when I say this place rocks! Get it, Castle (Rock) Chip Shop.",

Didn't seem to be an easy way to order two pieces of fish with small chips and had to order two of the fish and chip meals which was way too much food. Chips were tasty but could have been crispier. Fish was battered in front of us too.",
