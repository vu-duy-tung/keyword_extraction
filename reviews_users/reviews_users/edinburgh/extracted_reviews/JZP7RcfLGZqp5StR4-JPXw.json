It's not the best for large groups or buggies in my opinion, it's barely enough for two people at a table as the plates are huge and the tables so small. The full breakfast was tasty, I'll give it that but more on the expensive side at 7:50 so all in all it wasn't the best experience and the clock cafe would probably be my last port of call I'm afraid.",

    "text": "The Clock is a great little cafe on Dalry Road. It's not going to blow your socks off, but it does a pretty solid job at providing very reasonably priced food and drink that puts a smile on your face every time.  In my opinion, cafes shouldn't be fancy. They should be casual, rough around the edges and serve simple, cheap and calorific food. The Clock certainly ticks all those boxes.  There are a few small tables upstairs, but I don't think any of them can sit more than 2 people. Head down the spiral staircase in the middle of the floor to reach the much larger downstairs area.  Things are a bit worn down there, with some rather tatty chairs and sticky table tops. But they do their best to keep the place presentable and it doesn't feel dingy or depressing at all, just a little... well loved. One slight negative, though, is that they don't have any background music or radio or anything down there, so being away from the traffic noise and hustle and bustle from the kitchen makes the place as silent as a graveyard, which doesn't make for a good atmosphere!  The food is served in big portions on thick plates and is super tasty. There's loads and loads on the menu, and all of it will fill your belly for a mere few quid. The coffee is fairly decent too! The waitresses have always been perfectly friendly and efficient as well, which is a nice change from most humble cafes where you often get your food virtually thrown at you.  On the whole, there is no better place to grab a decent cheap breakfast or slap-up lunch in this part of town. Just don't expect the Ritz!",

I ordered the traditional breakfast, which comes with Orange juice, bread, eggs, sausage, really awesome crispy bacon and beans and all for a price of 5.80.

It certainly tickled my fancy.  I've only had a full breakfast once before after my arrival in the U.K., and remember feeling vaguely \"was that it?\" afterwards. To an American girl, beans with breakfast seems quite an exotic affair--but somehow, my first experience with a full breakfast was good, but left me missing that ZING of \"wow, that was good!\" Lemme tell ya, the Clock left me feeling that zing. Everybody has a go-to joint in their area for certain things: I think the Clock may well be mine now for breakfast!   The hubs and I arrived totally famished after a gym visit one day. We promptly ordered two flat whites, his regular, mine large, and when mine arrived I was stunned by the fish-bowl sized beverage that was presented. Okay, maybe it wasn't that big: but heads up! You'll get yer joe here, that's for sure! Food-wise, we both ended up getting the full breakfast, which we were pleased arrived with a glass of joe alongside. Everything on our plate was just perfect. Standard diner fare, buttery and delicious.  Where I think I would waver on my review is the interior: the bottom floor of the Clock is a bit ramshackle in feel. But somehow, it made me feel at home--diners in the small town I grew up in were much the same, simple and comfortable. Who can be bothered with fancy art and pristine, sterile architecture when there's good grub to be made? ;) Anyway, the wee spiral staircase smack dab in the middle of the place makes up for any questionable interior design. And that FOOD.  Will totally be back!",

I took a full breakfast and this came with toast and a glass of orange juice. 5.50 only. It was very tasty and filling.   This place is hidden in plain sight! Very popular locally and I am suitably worried if writing a review will introduce this place to too many people and I will not have a seat next time. - However they have got several other dotted around the city. Leith and Morningside. So perhaps it will encourage them open more branche.",

For a ridiculous 3 I ordered a ham and cheese baguette. Expecting it to turn up with a wee salad garnish, I was instead rewarded with a plate overflowing with food. A nice side salad featuring cherry tomatoes, red onions, peppers and mixed leaves and a perfectly munchable helping of chips were included as part of the price tag. For 3?! Amazing. The food was tasty, too.   The ambiance is relaxing and friendly. The Clock is a great place to soak up the weekend vibes with the Sunday papers and a coffee. Service was also friendly and prompt, so I really can't fault this place.",

    "text": "You know you sometimes get a gut instinct when a place is going to be good? I got that vibe about The Clock, and I was certainly not disappointed.  In an area with cheap eating options scattered all around, it can hard to settle on one of the many cafes. But something about The Clock stuck out from the other contenders vying for my hungry attention.   Perhaps it's the neo Victorian fronting, complete with pillar box red paint. Or maybe the clock decorating on the exterior struck me as being different from the remaining cheap or samey options. But whatever it was that lured me in, I'm very glad.  The Clock is somewhat new to the scene but I can see it being really successful. For a start, it's chilled out, nicely decorated with neutral art and cream coloured walls, and is spacious if you're in with a larger group. It may appear smaller on the outside but they have a secret spiral staircase taking you to a much more open dining area downstairs. If you can't get to this area, there's enough space upstairs for wheelchair or buggy access.  Secondly, along with a vast array of delicious, well prepared food, they also have a bottled beer and wine selection! This added bonus, along with the healthy portions you receive with main meals and even with lucnhtime snacks opens it out towards evening diners.  The staff seemed to genuinely care about the customers and were certainly passionate about cooking. This showed in the standard of my panini (which was also generously served up with chips and crispy salad). I opted for the Turkish sausage and it was outstanding. For a lunchtime snack it was way above par - definitely of a higher standard. I also received the best hot chocolate I've ever tasted, it was perfect. The girl's skills put me to shame since I would definitely 3 star my efforts half the time. But this one was a work of art! And all of that for a fiver!  It's very rare that you find a cafe with such incredible choice. But what really stands out is the pride the staff take in their work. They went out of their way to look after their customers, and the cooking was to die for.   Watch as word of mouth spreads about The Clock - in time, this will become one of Edinburgh's dining highlights.",

The upper floor is small, with maybe 4 or 5 tables dotted around the counter and the spiral staircase which breaks through the creaky wooden floors and winds down to a yet un-explored land.   I asked the lovely waitress for a take-away menu, to which she replied I couldn't take away the menu, perhaps a slight language mix up between us, but all was explained by someone who seemed to be the boss, and I was given a menu to peruse.  The vibe I got from the food was Italian, and I had my eye on the paninis which sounded right up my alley. Loads of chicken, pestos, rocket, mozzarella and sun-dried tomato combos. I went for a chicken and mozzarella panini with sweet chilli, which sounded lovely. I was told to take a wee seat at one of the tables until it was ready.  The walls are adorned with paintings, which had price tags on, some quite expensive. I wondered who would buy such a thing on a chance visit to a cafe!  My lunch didn't take long and I was handed a large box wrapped in brown paper in exchange for my 3.90.  Back at the office I was very pleasantly surprised when I opened it up to reveal some cheeky chips and salad alongside my panini, which was amazeboats by the way. Very nice flourish!  I will be back here, and I will descend those stairs!",
