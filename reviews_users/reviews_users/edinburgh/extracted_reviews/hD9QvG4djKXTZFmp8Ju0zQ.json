    "text": "I came here today and actually had one of the worst paninis I have received from baguette express. I usually opt for chicken tikka, cheddar cheese, onion and sweetcorn and the previous times I have been here I get a good serving but today was different. Just like Gavin, I received hardly any filling and felt pretty ripped off. I guess it really depends on the person you are served by, because the girl I was served by today was the first time she had done so and I will make sure I avoid being served by her in the future.  This Baguette Express is much like all the others selling the usual paninis, baked potatoes and baguettes as well as a range of snacks such as crisps and sweets and a pretty good range of drinks, which are unfairly expensive.",

    "text": "It's very rare that I give out a 2 star review, but on this occasion I simply had to. I'm a regular at Baguette Express on The Royal Mile, which is somewhat worryingly one of the best places to eat on that horrid thoroughfare, but I certainly won't be at this one.  Despite the exact same menu, they were completely incapable of providing me with my usual Cajun chicken, hot chilli sauce, mozzarella and jalapenos panini. There was hardly any filling, they didn't have a couple of vital ingredients, and in effect it was 2 slices of toasted bread drowned in hideous \"firecracker\" sauce.   As for the slice of Rocky Road, the less said about that the better.",
