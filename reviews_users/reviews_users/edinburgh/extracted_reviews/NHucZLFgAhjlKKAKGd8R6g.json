(needs to stay open till 5pm in my opinion) But to be fair when I got there only 20 min to close time (4pm) Almost all there soups were gone and there were just a few  chucks of bread left. So not much for selection when you come just before closing. But I had heard such good things about them and have wanted to try them for a while so I went for it. Got a tomato lentil soup that was so delicious! and had some nice brown bread for dipping! Perfect early 1st dinner before I headed to the train.  Really want to try and get there earlier in the day so I can try some other types of soups!",

Their products are obviously made with care and they have some really interesting soup choices on offer. As someone with a dairy allergy it is really nice to be able to have various Vegan options and not have to worry about milk products.  Though the space is small it is a nice atmosphere and the staff is very friendly. Cant wait to go back and try their whole variety of soups, amazing artisan breads and coffees.

The soup is delicious, it really is - and they always welcome you with a smile and helpful advice, should you need it. They're even dog friendly. Hurrah! It's tiny and busy, though, so watch your timings. Takeaway is a great option, as you can take your own soup pot and coffee mug, or use their 'green Veg ware'. You can find Union's fabulous soups in various other places around town (it gets taken there in a Dutch-style carrier bike - brilliant) too.  All in all, an Edinburgh staple, a fab wee business and highly recommended.",

Union of Genius offers great fresh soup and bread, but it is more than that, if your normal soup is Starbucks or Costa then Union of Genius is Brew Lab or Artisan Roast, whose coffee they keep funnily enough...  Ok, I hear you say, it's still just soup though... Just soup seems derogatory when applied in this instance. The soup from Union of Genius is full of flavour, healthy and in some cases unusual. They cater to the meat lover and the vegan equally, you can even check which of six soups most appeal online, though some do sell out.  Simply put, this is good food made with care and attention, give it a go and enjoy.",

When you walk in the smell of soup starts a chain reaction of human chemestry. I normally don't have soup for the reasan that I'm a tall person and need a lot to fill the space and gaps, but when entering this soup haven it is impossible to resist a bowl. I had the chicken and leek soup, 3.60 with onion bread. Mmmmmmuuuuaaaalisious! A must try, and the staff is great and friendly, the place is cosy and welcoming. Souper!",

I would not, however, recommend the bread bowl size, as the bread they use is a not great chewy white thing and the amount of soup is probably the same as a medium. I got a small soup and chose the olive bread which comes free. The bread was beautiful and the soup was great.",

It is located near the grassmarket and the university of Edinburgh too, which is a plus. It could do with offering a student discount though!  It's a good sign when business's keep it simple. Ben's cookies was a national success thanks to their dedication to good cookies, brew lab concentrates on coffee and buys most of its food from other local experts (including salad and soup from union of genius), anteaques specialises in amazing tea and scones. There is no need to overcomplicate things in a city where there is so much choice... Union of genius offers great porridge in the morning, and soup from lunch time onwards.   There are usually several options for the soup, and whilst it is quite pricey at about 3 in comparison to some of the other local student places nearby, the soup variety and ingredients are superb. There are always vegan and gluten free options, and you can usually choose between a quite light soup, or a more hearty one. I went for a lentil, pepper and harissa soup, which was thick, warming, spicy, and definitely what I was after on a cold winters day.  I'd like to go back to try the vegan cakes and some more soup...",

    "text": "Oh wow - I had read Jenny L's review of this place, but hadn't clocked where it actually was, so on my rare jaunt into the central university campus today, I had to stop by and try some soup.... and very glad I am that I did.  Had the Tomato Ramala (?) A lovely kick to it, nice and chunky with lentils not at all mushy. I also had a taster of the Cauliflower and Almond soup. Almonds are one of my favourite sweet things ever, and I love some roasted cauliflower. It was very good, but a little creamy for me - I couldn't have had a whole small one.   Have to say that for 3 it is VERY good value. The cafe at work charges 2.50 for a soup which is not as inventive as this, along with a crummy small roll (think the kind you get at a hotel mass catered function, that type that is sitting at your table when you arrive) This bread is delish - I had wholemeal, which does sound kinda boring when pitted against olive, 8 grain or onion, but it was a lovely wholemeal - not too dense and dry, with a good crust.  As Jenny said, +1 for the cuter than cute pots - and I also dig their commitment to the environment by having their take out stuff all compostable. Great job, and if the super lovely person who served me is readin, I wasn't kidding - get yourselves a truck or something and pitch up at KB - we need some decent lunches!!",

    "text": "I loved this little place. It was on my to-do list for awhile and a day of working at Edinburgh Uni meant I was in the right location to finally pay it a visit.   It is small and I would guess at lunchtime, being able to get a seat or not (and the weather) would determine if you would eat here. The rain was bouncing off the streets but given that it was around 3.20pm when I was having a very late lunch, then I got the large window seat.  Great choice of soups and perfect for veggies and gluten free peeps. Being GF, I thought I wouldn't be able to get bread but they toasted some GF bread for me so I wouldn't miss out (I LOVE it when places do this!). I opted for the mushroom soup - I know, I know, yelpers are not a fan of the humble mushroom, but as this is typically a soup which is (commercially) full of evil wheat flour, then it was great for it to be an option. It was lovely mushroomy soup and some little bits of mushrooms, all lovely with hints of pepper and garlic, not overly creamy but just really good soup.   I was about 3.60, I think for soup and bread. I loved my pot (I went for a little one but still a decent sized portion) and when I'm working in the area again, I'm sure I'll be here for more soup. The choice is so good and lots of great combinations so I'm sure my biggest problem will be, what to choose next?",

Donating soup every month to the homeless.  Lucky homeless. Their soup is freggin amazing. I had a seasonal (top three on the list), which means they're around for about a week. Some spicy chorizo and spinach concoction that made my mouth and tummy so completely happy. They serve it with fresh bread, like poppy seed, but I had gluten free sliced bread- it was cool this was an option.  Most people take away because there are like 6 seats. They have some kind of reward program for bringing back your to-go container. But I ferreted my way into a corner spot, next to some lovely French visitors, and sipped down my soup. Mmm. It was pricy, 3.50, especially when I had a nice to-go soup the other day for 1.50. But, quality, flavor, philosophy- these are worth it. And those philosophy majors need to get paid, too, right?",

However as it's the only big table in the room common courtesy is to share, which I don't mind doing...chatting is optional.   I was a extremely pleased to get to the table without six deep at the counter, it is almost unknown for me to be first for anything as every time previous its been packed. So with a tangent of success was feelin' good, towards solving the Empty Table Equation for example (pre-lunch + empty shop = table).  A bean, chorizo, tomatoy soup served on a slate in a stoneware bowl, home baked brown sesame bread, including a coffee for around a fiver, was great. In all it soup was not too cold(or seasoned badly), not too hot...but just right.   With UofG coming along when it did, thanks guys,  I've met many friendly staff in town but as it's not a large place  s'pose the smiles come with really enjoying your work! Can't wait to try another as think I'm hooked; but will my foodie/table experience be over...if not then I'll take it, but if it's a bad rap then maybe I'll just move forward to takeaway again?",

I opted for mine in a bread bowl - somehow it felt more manly for a bloke more used to burgers at lunchtime - but in hindsight I think this was a bit unnecessary.  The soups are so flavoursome that sticking them in a white bread basin actually makes them a bit less attractive to the pallet. If it was a seafood chowder in a sourdough bowl then different story.  Coffees after were great - Artisan Roast beans so you know it's going to be a decent cuppa.   My only gripe is the size. There's only one table with four chairs and a small shelf that squeezes in a couple of stools so if you want to sit in you're going to be sharing your personal space with others. Sadly for us  those others were a couple of loud  'oh my gosh, Tarquin crashed the Beemer' types, which though entertaining for the first 5 minutes quickly became like really tedious - yeah?  On soup alone this place would easily hit the 5 star mark, and if I was taking away then that's what I'd give it.",

How on earth can I prepare for this!?!? Ah.... ha. I know. Soup from Union of Genius, it is on the way, and it is tasty, and I have always said I would give it another go!  So, I turned up a slightly late to meet Allie, who had already managed to bag the bench by the window. On offer today were many delights including - Scotch Broth, Pumpkin with sumac, Tomato Rasam, Caldo Verde, Cream of wild mushroom Potato and Parmesan. What else could I have chosen, on the feast day of the patron of our bonnie country, other than Scoth Broth. It was delicious! I had the onion bread with it as it was so tasty last time!  I still say it is not the sort of place you could 'go for lunch'. it is more somewhere to 'pick up lunch'. I mainly think this as we had an older couple sitting opposite us, not saying much, whilst we were nattering away and having a good old gossip! I am sure our stories amused them! But back to the point. Soup - Yum. Bread - Scrummy. Service - Great. Will be returning as I still have not got my paws on the Coronation Chicken Soup!!",

It's a tiny shop with a decent line around lunch time but it moved quickly and the soups came out quickly as well. A variety of choices, all of which sounded delicious. To try a few, opt for the sampler of 3, I went with a large potato, chorizo, and kale. It came with a choice of bread and the meal was in front of me in a matter of minutes. I loved the cute presentation in the soup crock on the slate board! The soup was piping hot and very flavorful. the chili's looked great as well and a bit more hearty.

Their broccoli, miso, almond salad was hearty and healthy and gave me the much needed vegetables I was lacking in my diet this week. My friend also loved her golden chicken chili. Both of our meals (all of their meals) come with one of three different types of bread (or oat cakes for anyone gf).   Bring your own reusable bowl or bring your take away back to be composted and get rewarded with loyalty points.",

    "text": "When I think of a soup cafe, I think of the soup nazi from Seinfeld. Luckily, the soup is just as amazing without the heavily mustachioed man.  Union of Genius has a plethora of amazing soups to choose from, with options catering to those who are gluten and dairy intolerant as well as the lovely veggie and vegan crowd. For ~5, you get a standard sized soup and your choice of bread. If you don't want bread, they always offer you a piece of fruit. If you're caught between a few choices, you can even opt for a soup flight which features three soups and three types of bread! I have yet to try their Vegan Chilli, but it sounds amazing. Other than that, they also have a lovely display of vegan and gluten-free treats to satisfy your sweet tooth!   The staff are lovely, and I also really like their suspended soup program. If you have the extra money, you pay for a stranger's soup in case they can't afford it. I thought this was a really sweet gesture and really helps spread the Pay It Forward mentality. The only thing is the lack of seating; however, I usually manage to squeeze my way in, so it's not too big a problem.",

This is a super small joint -- enough seating for about 10 people inside (if you are squishing and sitting with randos). I got a large autumn harvest soup with barley and tons of kale and vegetables along with some olive bread (3 pieces). The soup was hearty and filling but on the bland side. I thought there would be more flavor given the amount of sauces/spices displayed in the store but it was lacking. The olive bread was delicious though and for just under 5 pounds -- this is a good meal! I loved that the soup was served in such cute little pots , definitely sit-in and enjoy the soup! There are also some gluten free sweets and such... I tried some chocolate cake samples they had and it was pretty good (especially the frosting!)   Would go back to try some of the other soups on a cold (or detox) day!",

My all-time favorite flavor is the chorizo, chili, sweet potato soup. Can't decide which bread I like best: poppyseed, maybe? Located just a block from the University campus, it's my go-to spot for a takeaway lunch. The only downside to this place is the minimal seating options inside. But don't let that stop you.",

I had to take the bus home and was quite surprised to find that my soup was still piping hot by the time I finally got to dig in. Great Eco packaging!   The soup was super flavourful and divine. The kind of soup you eat and feel healthier for eating, and after eating it your belly feels very happily satisfied and warmly full. It's a win win situation in every way.   It's always really nice to find a healthy & delicious alternative to the typical takeaway. Highly recommended!!",

More expensive than most of the other lunch places nearby but it merits every penny & the soup comes with delicious locally baked bread which you don't get elsewhere.   There's a good selection which caters for everyone. They always have dairy free, gluten free & veggie options. They have lovely cakes & make great coffee too.   It's always busy. Seating is limited & if you are late (after half 1) they may have sold out of a few of the soup choices. They are that popular.",

There is only one table with a bench seat awash with comfy cushions and modern seats on the other side.   There is a small  counter with stools and great music playing in the background.  Outside on the street there are tables for alfresco dining.    I had a lovely surprise when I had to choose from the artisan choice of which chocolate to have in my mocha coffee.  Five to choose from, would it be Madagascan,  orange spice, Ethiopian, Tanzanian or white chocolate?  I had the chocolate from Madagascar, my mocha coffee was delicious.  Lots of tea choice from Scottish breakfast to Bollywood dreams chai.   It was only 9.30 in the morning yet customers were in enjoying the home made  soup or ordering taking away in cartons.  A great sign the soup must be fab.  Union of Genius mantra seems to be homemade local, sustainable and carbon free soup.   I'm in Edinburgh for a wee break so I will definately be back for their soup as I've been craving it ever since my visit.  Xoxo",
