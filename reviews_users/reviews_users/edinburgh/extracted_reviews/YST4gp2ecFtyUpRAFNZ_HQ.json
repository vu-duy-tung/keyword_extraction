Because of this the dog would allegedly visit this pub to eat whilst visiting his master's grave situated right behind the statue. The pub adopted the name as the reputation of the dog grew. It's a cute pub and when I came here there was some live folk music going on. It's a bit of an old-mans-pub, nothing too fancy and the prices are a bit of a tourist trap but I would still come here just for the story and the warm atmosphere!",

As a matter of fact, when walking in on a rainy Tuesday evening it felt like a warm cosy living room, generously sprinkled with comfy chairs and tables.   I love this place. It's so ... comfy, and homey. Whenever I'm a wee bit homesick, I just pop in here for a nice little read and everything just fades into the background. It's calm, (on weekday afternoons) it's quiet, and it's comfortable. What more could you want?  Why not the full five stars them? Well, when we walked in they had already turned off the espresso-machine and there was no hot water for tea available. Both being cold, we were feeling a little bit sad about no hot drinks, but settled for a cold pint. (Which ended up doing the job quite nicely).   The barmaid did tell us that there was a cafe across the street and that we were welcome to sneak in  a take-away coffee from there as long as we held it under the table. Of course she only told us this after we'd ordered and paid for our drinks.   However, this didn't take away the ambiance of the place for me. I still like it as a cosy comfy well, gezellig (look it up, it's an untranslatable Dutch word) pub.",

The pub itself is quite cute, in that it's very traditional and \"scottish\", from the good range of whiskies behind the bar to the Haggis Neeps and Tatties on the menu. That's all great, but because it targets tourists it's more expensive than other pubs in the area.  Aside from that, there's nothing particularly bad to say about the pub. But I've drunk there half a dozen times or so and I still can't help thinking that if it weren't for the gimmicky aspect of it then it wouldn't do nearly as well as it does; at the end of the day it's part of a local chain.",

With a cute story behind the name and a traditional Scottish pub atmosphere it is no surprise it is heaving with tourists, especially during the festival. However if you are an Edinburgh resident, there are many other bars that do the same but better. Greyfriars is just a bit cliched, with the old memorabilia on the walls, and the traditional style decor.   The atmosphere is good though, especially if you are with a group of mates. Due to the fact it is quite small it fills up quickly, but if you get a booth then you can have a few drinks with friends. Don't expect a wide range of beers though, the bar is tiny and always packed. The food too is pretty average.  The pub quiz though is good fun, and refreshingly quite challenging. Also they have live music now and then which gives the pub an extra selling feature, but to be honest, unless you are a tourist it's just a little bit boring.",

    "text": "Ah, good old Bobby's.  With over 400 pubs to choose from in Edinburgh, it can often be difficult to decide where to go.  Greyfriar's Bobby bar maintains a peaceful, relaxed refuge while still being situated next to one of the city's characteristic landmarks, only a few hundred metres from the tourist drenched royal mile.   Bobby's is for those who like their pubs traditional, yet not crammed with the usual air of villainy that can usually be associated with such a place.  Upon entering, you are greeted with a slightly dim yet comfortable atmosphere reminiscent of what you'd imagine a stately home would be like.  This veneer is complimented by the tasteful, nostalgic memorabilia that hangs from the walls, such as portraits and old parchment reinforcing the familiar tale of the eponymous canine.    As a student, Bobby's offers a welcome haven from the regular mould of student packed bars scattered across the surrounding city, while still offering an attractive benefit for the beer drinkers in the form of 2 pints of Guinness, Tennent's or Belhaven Best upon the flash of a student card.  However, spirits can be a bit on the pricey side for a student budget (I'd say regular pricing for other non student orientated drinking establishments) which often leads to the formation of \"sausage fests\": the non-beer drinking female student often wishes to take her business elsewhere. Yet this still leaves open the option of having a few pints with the lads wide open.    The staff here are fantastic.  I have always been welcomed to the bar with friendly mannerisms, even under busy periods. And more importantly, they certainly know how to poor a proper pint of Guinness!  While I haven't personally succumbed to the temptation of one of the hearty meals on offer, I have observed the enjoyment upon the faces of those who have and feel confident that I would not be disappointed.   Bobby's always attracts a good mix of clientele. It is popular with tourists yet there have been few occasions that I have been present there where the place has been chalk a block with them, an issue that often puts Edinburgh residents off such places. The seating is usually plentiful, with a recent rearrangement offering more, however I'd still recommend an early arrival on Fridays and Saturdays to guarantee maximum comfort.   For those musically inclined, be sure to check out some of the excellent traditional folk acts that often play there.   Overall, Bobby's remains one of my favourite places in Edinburgh for going out for a drink or two, and I have often gone for a cheeky afternoon pint with a few pals that has blossomed into an enjoyable evening there.",

Located on Candlemaker Row, just off the George IV Bridge in central Edinburgh, Greyfriars Bobby is famed mostly as the place where the dog Bobby waited patiently for his dead master to return to him for 14 years before expiring - they're both buried in the nearby Greyfriars Graveyard.   The bronze statue of said hound out the front of the pub is a fixture of the Edinburgh tourist route - so much so that apparently at some point in the past a cluey owner of the pub turned the statue around so as to include Greyfriars Bobby Bar in the background of any photos taken of the front of the statue. Can't get better marketing than that.   Anyhoo - go along on Wednesday night for some great live music and a few quiet drinks.",

Thirsty and dying for a seat, I was intrigued to visit the pub because of the iconic status attached to the name, which is probably what draws many tourists here in the first place.  From the outset, the pub looks just like a regular traditional pub, but inside it is steeped in the heritage of Greyfriar's Bobby. Pictures and stories are everywhere. The layout of the pub is sort of tiered, with a few steps between each and a teeny wee bar in the middle of it all. I was there at about half past 4 and the bar was full of all different types of clientele; tourists, students, businessmen and families.   We did have to wait a while to be served, but when we eventually were, it cost almost 12 for two beers and a glass of white wine, which was expected as the tourist market is very high here.   The ambience was nice, and we sat leisurely drinking and chatting for almost 2 hours without noticing time passing! We did notice people eating though, and it looked and smelt amazing, in particular the haggis, neeps and tatties that the table next to us were tucking into. You can also get a range of bar food like mini fish and chips for an amazing 1.95, which I would be interested to try! The meals weren't too expensive and all under 10, pretty good for the location of the pub really.  I would definitely come back here for a drink next time I am round this way.",

    "text": "I've been coming here off and on for ten years and am sad to say, after a brief period of brilliance, the pub at Greyfriars Bobby's has devolved into a blatant business catering to the masses.  When I first visited, the pub was crowded, tight, and fully-focused on drinking. That last bit made up for the first two, and I immediately took a shine to it. Through the years, the owners made some improvements. They opened up the space and moved the bar back a bit. This launched the Golden Years at Greyfriars Bobby, when anyone from any walk of life could grab a pint and have a seat near the adorable statue of a dog with a cute story. I remember fondly several days sitting in a booth watching the rain with my girlfriend, sharing some pints, and a moment.  Sadly things have regressed of late. The area where you can drink and relax has been pushed into a crammed corner downstairs. Oh, there's also a petite patch near the door, if you don't mind the constant limbo around people walking in.  The rest and best of the space is now dedicated to eating, and while the fare looked palatable, I generally like to separate dinner and libations.  I'll probably be back, given my memories and love for this place, but a new quest now begins to find a True pub in Edinburgh in which to relax.",

I took the obligatory selfie with it (the world does not need to see it) and decided to pop in and finally have a look.  Y'know what? It's alright! Looked to me like the top part was for eatin' and the rest was for drinkin' - and that was fine. A damn fine selection of beers on tap - I had Hobgoblin, a great beer in the winter - and staff that helped folk who weren't quite sure what they were drinking.  The food I could smell seemed to be good quality, and the staff were all friendly, despite the freezing cold temperatures outside and several \"well lubricated\"  punters further down the bar.  Not somewhere I'd call a \"must visit\" but definitely would have no problems about returning.  Plus, it's named after the wee dug! How can you not like that? :D",

I ordered a side salad that amounted to less than 1/4 cup of lettuce for 3 along with a bowl of cullen skink. Very pricey menu for what you receive, but the wait staff is very polite and fast.

It's a nice enough place, with traditional-style decor, a good selection of ales and whiskies, an interesting menu which includes haggis, neeps and tatties, and of course tons of Bobby-related memorabilia.   And therein lies its drawback. Like any establishment that uses a legend or other gimmick to draw customers, it caters to the tourist trade and charges twice as much as other bars in the area. I thought the prices were rather steep here.  I guess the same advice applies as with any other tourist spot: drop in if you happen to be in the area and are really interested in the local legend, but don't go out of your way for it.",

Rather than get myself into a knot, I saw the Greyfriars Bobby's Bar right there and heard the football match, so I popped in. A moment later, a delicious pint was poured for me and I found a comfortable seat with a view of one of the many wall-mounted televisions.  Free wi-fi worked great so I could post a few pictures and see what was next on my bookmarks list. I didn't see any power outlets, though I didn't look too hard. Several tables outside for the smokers and the sun worshipers. This is a great spot for tourist watching, as not only the Museum is here, but the Greyfriars Bobby statue is right outside and the Greyfriars Kirk is next door. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FGreyfriars_Bobby&s=30cfe1916dd5eee66ba4d5e7f3e27cef5660ab7bf2a6f52849de4263f7d26b6f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr...</a>  Very comfortable, friendly pub.

My tourist-trap spider sense went off a little bit when I noticed alll the music they were playing was, well, Scottish (the Proclaimers, Rod Stewart, etc).  Depending on the time of day, it's a nice place to go and read a book.   Later in the week I noticed it got a lot more touristy in terms of the patrons, and the accompanying noise level.   All in all, not a bad place to go for a Pint or two, but you wouldn't want to make a night of it.",

First was a trip with my dad but it has now turned into a nice wee convenient place to pop into when visiting friends who need to be close to public transport.   As Stephanie has pointed out, if you want to learn about the little dog that so many love, then ditch the old tatty book your granny gave you and just get a drink in and wander about this little gem to learn and love the story. The pub itself is in a wee time wrap, with a proper boozer feel to it but it is full of friendly punters.  For all the times I've been here I have never had anything to eat until last week. I ordered the Arbroath Smokie Fishcakes and my girlfriend went for the Curried Lamb Shank with Apricots. Both were bluudy marvellous and very reasonably priced - around 7/8 quid each.   A brilliant staple in the city centre area and come highly recommended.",

Pints cost at least 3 each and a single spirit and mixer costs around the same price, if not more.  The food looks excellent and their menu boasts a wide range of locally sourced ingredients.  Their roast beef looks delicious and succulent, but it costs about 8 which doesn't give much room for manoeuvre if you're just out for lunch. Having said this, it's got a friendly and comfortable atmosphere which is ideal if you're watching the football or rugby on the weekend.  It doesn't really need to market itself to students as it easily attracts enough custom from the locals who seem to love the place.",

His jokes were terrible, but his energy and musicianship were very good.  There were many sing-along, foot-stomping kind of moments.

    "text": "I can't say I sought out this pub but did end up here my last night in Edinburgh. It turned out a happy accident.  Maybe it's because I was just a dumb tourist but I can't agree with some of the reviewers of the place.    First of all, I didn't find the prices to be any more expensive than any other places I visited.  In fact, some of their whiskies were downright bargains.  Other than that, I only had a draft beer so I can't say what their other drinks prices are.  Maybe vodka is pricey there.  The food was also within range of what I'd seen throughout the city and was actually delicious.  I'd eat there again no problem.  Second of all, from what I could tell, my group of 3 were the only tourists in site.  In all fairness, I was there on a late March Monday night so maybe that had something to do with it.  Still, I was the only \"funny talker\" within ear shot.  The place was quiet and on my visit blissfully calm with just the right amount of ambient buzz.  It was also clean and just warm enough to not feel stuffy or chilled.  Look, I can't say this place is that different from anywhere else that I ate-except for one thing.  The service here was phenomenal.  No joke.  I almost felt like I was a regular with the great service we received.  Writing this, I ask myself why I was surprised it was so friendly.  I can't say I was ever treated rudely on my visit at any other place I ate or drank.   I don't know, for some reason both bartenders were just outstanding in their treatment to us.  From drink recommendations to their opinions on what to order for the meal, they were always smiling and never seemed put off by our questions.  I guess they made me feel like my visit there mattered and that is why they stand out.  Cheers to you Sarah and Luke!  Bottom line here, if you're hungry and want a drink to go along with the food, you'll get that here.  What's wrong with that?  Nothing, I say!  Ironically when I checked in, I somehow checked into the statue out front and not the actual bar.  Ah well, I was a bit cold and ready for some warm food.  I claim hunger distraction as the cause.  Chain or not.  Tourist trap or not.  I don't care, I'd go back again without a second thought.",

Their prices are very reasonable and the waitresses are quite pleasant!   If you haven t reserved your table in advance, you ll have to wait, but the organisation is flawless, there is no jumping the queue. Just their beer is, unfortunately, rather warm. But it may have been just our bad luck ... Twice!  Absolutne fantasticky haggis s bramborovou kasi a velky vyber pivnich specialu. At si z nasi skupinky dal kdokoli cokoli, byl z jidla nadseny :) A hamburgery obrovske! Ceny velmi rozumne, servirky vcelku prijemne!   Na misto u stolu se musi bez rezervace cekat, ale organizace je bezchybna, nikdo nepredbiha. Jen pivo je, bohuzel, vazne dost teple. Ale treba jsme jen meli smulu... Dvakrat!",

The crust is thicker than the typical pub pie crust and has a unique flavour on its own. My dog also enjoyed his time there - he had a great snoozle on their luscious rug while we had lunch!",

The pub is very quaint and welcoming from the exterior (if you can maneuver around the tourists taking photos with Bobby's statue!). Once you enter it is instantly warm and cheery. I was seated quite quickly and after some tips from the waitress was given a delicious cider from the tap. I ordered the haggis starter which was my first taste of the delicacy. It was delicious and the gravy was divine. I ordered the mixed grill for my meal which included chicken, steak, ham, sausage and egg along with chips and peas. Everything was cooked perfectly and was a pleasure to eat. The ham (gammon steak) was my favorite. I also had a 25% off coupon from their website which sweetened it all. Over all a very pleasant experience! I may stop back in before I leave Edinburgh.",

I figured that the food would probably be mediocre and overpriced. I was happy to be wrong on both counts. They were full so we had to wait a few minutes for a table but they invited us to get a drink at the bar while we waited. The bar had a nice selection on tap: two IPAs, a chocolate stout, and some lagers. I had a Treasure IPA and my husband had a shandy. By the time we got our drinks, a table was ready.   After a rainy afternoon in the highlands, the venison sausage and mash hit the spot. My husband also enjoyed his lamb shank pie. For 2 beers and two mains we paid just under 30.  There was only one server, who was very nice, so service was a bit slow.",

Close to the church grounds where said Greyfriars Bobby terrier once - allegedly - guarded the grave of his deceased master, a police officer, for years - and of course next to the Greyfriars Bobby statuette - you will find this traditional pub that may seem like a tourist trap but isn't. Yes, prices for food are slightly higher than at other pubs in the neighborhood, but not outrageously so.  The decor is simple and essentially British pub 1-0-1. One weekends there is frequent musical entertainment. The pub is not terribly huge, so on weekends and weeknights it can get crowded. When the music is on it does get loud. Generally pleasant atmosphere and staff.  The real ale selection is modest but solid, and IIRC they are \"Cask Marquee\", too (which means that CAMRA volunteers are regularly checking the freshness of the hand-pumped ales).",
