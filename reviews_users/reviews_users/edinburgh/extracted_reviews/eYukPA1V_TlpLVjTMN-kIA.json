    "text": "The Best Kebab House is exactly that, The Best Kebab House in Leith. Owned by a super-cool British-Turkish family, they have been in business for over two decades and are proud survivors of the Leith Tram fiasco. A very useful place when you just don't feel to cook or after pubs' closing times. Their super professional, efficient and friendly staff will always welcome you. My all-time favourites are the large Shish Kebab, Kofte Kebab & the Salami Garden Pizza. The place can get packed after midnight with high-spirited-kind-of-intoxicated punters, so watch out as you'll find the local fauna at it best!!!  A Leith classic not to be missed!!!",

    "text": "This is certainly not the 'best' kebab house I've been to, nor will it probably be the best that anyone's been to.  There's nothing really wrong with the service, it's friendly enough and they serve the food pretty quickly.  The problem is the food.  The kebabs in most takeaways look quite greasy and fatty, but these are in a whole other coronary leage altogether.  The donner meat which I tasted was salty and fatty, the salad wasn't too fresh and the chips weren't great either.  It was quite cheap, costing only about 3, but even this was steep considering the poor quality.   Maybe I came at a bad time for them, but when there are so many decent takeaways in the area it's unlikely that I'll be back.",

My experience with Best Kebab couldn't have been more routine, except when I placed my order. The guy at the counter rung up the order and...pulled my chips from under the counter...all ready...like he made it 5 minutes before I even arrived.  Now, if they can time travel and freshly cook my order before i've even entered the shop, then they can have the title Best Kebab.  But in reality, I can only imagine how long it had been sitting there and walked out the shop as fast as I could.",

He will then go on to be suprised when the child fails his first exam and drops out to become a kebab shop owner instead.  Thats the sort of dissapointment you will feel when entering this kebab shop. The food is poor, the service is poor and overall the price is poor.  Not a great place, certainly not the 'Best'.",

Usually I end up getting the special donner meat and potatoes which I can't recommend enough. The place looks very clean too and with friendly staff and late opening hours it really is the best kebab house.",
