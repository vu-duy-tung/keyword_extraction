    "text": "I don't go there very often, well, only went there twice in 2 years. Reason being that I found this place not very inviting and also not the cheapest when deals were not on. Since then it appears that the deals have gotten much better (eg. A medium pizza for the price of a small one all day long) and the interior and cleanliness has improved. There is even a screen that tells you for how long you have to wait for a pizza/take away. Its Friday evening and I only waited 10min. I got the Pizza with the Italian crust and a garlic tip. There are plenty of choices from the menu when it comes to pizza sizes and toppings. I'm sure you can even create your own variation. The pizza itself tasted deliciously cheesy and juicy.Yep, not the most healthy dining option, but definitely worth the one off experience.  I also got offered 2 ciders and a coke with one of the deals. Did not even know they also serve alcohol! The staff was super friendly. So all in all it was a very satisfying experience with this branch.",

    "text": "Efficient and fast, good rolling machine... expensive but with the coupons you can get an OK deal and you can actually combine them! Like 2 for 1 AND free coke and garlic bread. I personally love the cheese and bbq sauce crust, yum! Bit of a heavy door to be opening holding a stack of pizza's, quite the challenge!  update: did get a wrong order once, just wrong crust filling, no biggie it happens, but I did report it online and was expecting to hear 'something' back but didnt",

    "text": "It may seem somewhat lacklustre to review a single chain of Domino's but I feel there's enough to say to justify it. Bear in mind then that the four stars here go for the quality of staff and service at this particular branch and do not necessarily reflect my opinion of the chain of restaurants as a whole. If you don't already like Domino's then this outlet isn't going to change your mind.  I know I'm certainly not alone in my love for a dirty takeaway pizza every now and then and I have to say that this Domino's really hits the spot. The orders are always cooked and ready on time and the staff generally know what they're doing. A good rule of thumb as to the quality of oft-frequented chains is how often they've gotten your order wrong. We've all experienced it, you ask for no mushrooms and somehow end up with the shiitake special - but never once here has my order been anything but exactly what I specified.  I'm not all too sure if this is a staple across all the Domino chain but you can get  a large pizza with any two toppings for 8 here and whilst that may be more expensive than the greasy takeaway a couple of doors down, it's easily enough to feed two people and it tastes pretty good too.  There's always a steady stream of staff flooding in and out of the doors into cars delivering takeaways so they're obviously pleasing some customers.  Whilst I certainly see the merit behind the argument that big chains kill competition blah blah blah, I feel happy in this case that I know there's a (relatively cheap) option close by for when I want to have a few mates round and get the pizzas in.  And they do 241 on Tuesdays on all pizzas - which is nice...",

    "text": "Occupying a prime spot on a corner of Dalry Road opposite Somerfield supermarket and close to the Telfer Subway, this Domino's is a great little place. The pizzas are always delicious with a good selection of toppings and many delicious starters and desserts to order as well. There are generally some good deals to be had at Domino's so do ask the staff or pick up a menu/flyer. If you walk in and order a pizza it is generally ready to take away within 10 minutes, and there are seats on which you can wait. It is also possible to order online at their website, however as I have never done this I cannot comment on timings. The staff are generally willing to help and fairly pleasant. It's quite hard to resist the wonderful pizza smells wafting out as you walk past so why not just drop in?",

I've done this a few times with friends and the pizza is always great tasting and we've never had to wait very long for our order. I've never had any problems with the deliveries and the prices are what you would expect for a pizza chain. The menu has a great choice of pizzas and I particularly like the half and half option. Definitely recommended.",
