Located in a great place, in front of St. Giles Cathedral, you can take a rest from the rain or just have a late brunch.  Really great capuccino (comes with a draw like flower on the cream, super cute) and croissant (french style) that comes with butter and jam. Price is reasonable for the city.",

Anyway, we found this one, we had just missed breakfast (ends at 11:15) which was fine because what we had, we liked and the guy helping us couldn't have been nicer. Give this place a try if you are looking for something quick, simple and imo good. The florentine was good, I wanted to try the brownie but didn't get a chance, its right behind the cathedral off the royal mile.",

The Cathedral Cafe helps fund the Cathedral, and I love this idea. But don't go to the wrong place if you're expecting the other cafe. You'll be confused and highly disappointed. If you're not picky about your food and are just wanting a quick lunch or breakfast, then the Cathedral cafe would be just fine.",

This combination turned out very good! The creamy Brie with the salty bacon and sweet syrup on he fluffy/crisp waffle was exactly what I needed. Their cappuccinos weren't bad, though a little more wet than I'm used to. The service was prompt and friendly. The atmosphere was typical for a busy morning breakfast hotspot. Light, bright, and quick to turn over. I wouldn't mind coming back due to their convenient location, good food, and decent prices.",

For dessert I tried their chocolatiest treat: Chocolate ganache cake. Delicious and SO chocolatey!! My boyfriend had the waffle with nutella and I have to admit I stole about half of it. delicious waffle!!!   At the end, I went upstairs for the bathroom, and saw that the best seats are actually on the top floor! With a bird's eye view on the Royal mile, you can people watch from just about any comfy seat (it's armchairs-only upstairs!!) thanks to well-placed mirrors. Lovely!!",

The coffee was freshly made & very nice indeed. We just had to have a little something to go with it. Greame opted for the carrot cake, a thing of beauty! I had a bit of millionaires shortbread and my parents shared a piece of tiffin, not a crumb was left. The only problem with this place is the accoustics. There was a large table in the corner who were speaking rather loudly & it echoed round the place!No soft furnishing to absorb the noise!That said I would return! The staff were really nice",

It has such a warm & cosy atmosphere in the winter, lovely to just sit, chat, drink tea and eat cake. Inside it is dimly lit which it gives it a calm and laid back vibe, the staff are young and attentive, the ceiling is high and offers interesting views from whatever place you are sat, check out upstairs (where the loos are) its a lighter, brighter space with sofas and big mirrors and a great view. St Giles Cafe is a much better alternative to the chain coffee shops.",
