    "text": "After reading Blythe's review, I'm doubly sad that I didn't get a chance to stay for a bite at this charming little cafe. Instead, it was a mad dash in to grab a drink, as I was running late for a meeting. So how did I manage to come up with a star rating after only five minutes? Because within those five minutes, I found enough admirable things to make me bookmark it as a future work spot... and trust me, I don't find those as often as you'd think.   Sure, there are dozens of cafes in town that I could hunker down in for an afternoon of emails but there are very few that tick all the boxes for the perfect work space - especially when my to-do list requires more creativity than slogging through an inbox. It needs to have good light, be quiet (but not TOO quiet), serve up good food AND drink (I can give the nod to at least one of those) and have an owner/staff that don't give me the evil eye for parking in one spot for a few hours.   As far as I can tell: Crumbs Cafe clears this list with flying colours - the big windows allow lots of natural light, the room was welcoming, it was calm enough to hear myself think and they were very friendly on my quick visit. I'll definitely be back to give this place a proper go but for now, i'd say it's a very solid bet for a nice lunch or an out of office office hour.",

On our last day in Edinburgh, I got the full Scottish breakfast and the black pudding was delicious. I was a little hesitant to try it at first. Great little cafe. The workers were friendly too.",

It's a really good place to spend a relaxing morning or afternoon, so do pop in, next time you're passing.  Overall, we said: \"Crumbs hit the spot, very nicely. Both soup and sandwich made for good eating, and I found the welcome very warm. This friendly little local cafe is doing good work, so is well worth popping in, next time you're passing.\"",

Small place, only two tables inside, two tables outside. So good we might do again for our 4 day stay in Edinburgh.",
