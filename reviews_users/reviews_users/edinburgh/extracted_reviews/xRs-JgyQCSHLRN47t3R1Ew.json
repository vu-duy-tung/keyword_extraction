    "text": "After visiting three cities in three countries over eight days, I wanted to have a casual, light dinner that exemplified the best Scotland has to offer. To me, that is its seafood. This beautiful new brasserie in the elegant Balmoral Hotel shows off the bounty of Scotland's waters to its fullest extent.  I started with an excellent French 75 cocktail of gin, champagne and other deliciousness.   I ordered three smaller dishes to eat in sequence. I started with six briny Cumbrae oysters. They were so fresh and tasted of the cold, salty sea from which they were recently plucked. Outstanding with just a drop or two of fresh lemon juice.   Next I had a dish of dressed brown crab. This crabmeat was so insanely sweet and fresh and, well...crabby. It came with a beautiful house-made and somewhat sweet (appealingly so) mayonnaise.  I devoured the rather generous portion, and the nicely dressed salad of mixed greens and radicchio underneath.    Last I had a langoustine cocktail. It consisted of at least four or five meaty and sweet tails and a good sized langoustine head with the most delicious brains to devour. Loved this dish.   I finished with a delicious hybrid cassis cake/pudding. Great texture and flavor, not too sweet. Just right. For good measure, I had a glass of Noans La Tunella, a beautiful white dessert wine. Crisp and sweet, beautifully balanced. The botrytis did its thing just right!  Service was extremely attentive and very pleasant. I have to imagine that their other, more substantial dishes must be outstanding based on the happy faces so saw all around me.   Heartily recommend this great new addition to the upscale Edinburgh dining scene!",
