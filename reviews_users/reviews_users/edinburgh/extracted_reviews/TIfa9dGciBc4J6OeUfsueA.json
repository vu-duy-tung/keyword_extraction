And by men in suits I mean exactly that: men, who watch rugby and are not very nice to you if you a) are not wearing a suit and b) don't watch rugby. It's a very simple equation.   They have a pretty good range of ales here. Though, because it's in the suit part of town (about 10 seconds down the street from Princes Street), the prices are way higher than I'd like them to be.   This pub is really spacious and shows its fair share of sports on the telee, hence the rugby fans. The also serve your bogstandard pub food. A la pricey, to boot.",

This is a surprisingly lovely traditional pub that sits next to the two previously mentioned establishments. It does tend to attract a slightly older crowd, but I quite like this and it adds an air of decorum to the place: everyone is well-behaved and polite. The bar is well stocked with all the usual suspects and there is a large range of real ales on offer. They have live music on some nights and it's pretty good, plus there's not another traditional pub as good as this anywhere in the vicinity of Princes Street. Check it out next time you're weary from retail therapy.",

You just order and go back to your table.    There are small granite and wood tables scattered about the exterior of the room, with an open area to mingle in the middle. There is lots of wood and neat architecture. The ground level is very welcoming.  I can sit and drink for a while, or head upstairs.  Very high ceilings and a second floor that is the restaurant level (the so called Gallery Restaurant). The best seat in the house is on the restaurant level with a table that overlooks the rest of the bar. An awesome view. I eat on the second level of course, and had a great steak.  The other items on the menu are mussels, bangers and mash, other traditional Scottish fair.  Very good, well made, and fresh food.  On to the beer! Over 10 hand pumps. Two pumps for the big seller Deuchars IPA. The rest are all different and rotating Scottish micros. All are of very high quality.  Stuarts,  Inveralmond, Orkney, etc.  An excellent selection.  This is a pub that has been independent for over 100 years, and I love it. Like I said above, a must stop when getting off at Waverly.",

It is just behind the end of Princess street, just need to walk up a bit... Walking in the interior really surprised me, gorgeous! The staff was helpful and knowledgeable in suggesting some of their wide range of beers. I went back later for dinner, which was upstairs with again incredibly friendly staff. I had the wellington with cheese and nuts, it was actually really really good 'pub food', in all honesty it blew me away as I had not expected anything this tasty... Actually writing this makes me want to go back now and get another one. Will take more people here! Stylish and good!  edit: Went back again for lunch, more limited menu but still tasty. The upstairs is closed then so you sit in the downstairs bar area and order at the bar. A shocker was that the bartender/waiter was actually really rude and while we were trying to order sighing and saying 'you can't be serious' when we just needed a few seconds to ask our friend if he wanted cheese on his sliders. I was quite shocked of the rudeness and addressed him about it, just a friendly question if there is any problem... he told me someone called in sick and they were understaffed. Still no reason to say things like that and roll eyes in front of customers, while we were really not being extremely slow or so. After I addressed him about it he suddenly was a lot nicer. Still, quite a bummer as I was taking two friends and had been speaking so highly about the place... I understand stress can do a lot, but still no excuse. Food was luckily yummy!",

From when you walk through the revolving doors to take in the amazing cornice work to the big horse shoe style bar taking pride of place I always feel like this bar is from another time. The more gentle soles amongst you will be pleased that the food area and bathrooms are more modernised and fully ... turned out with contemporary fixtures. ;D  The folks in the bar are normally a mix of regulars and those that have just popped in, but always friendly. The staff are knowledgable and chatty as a whole. There is a large tv above the door, but this doesnt really detarct from proceedings. Last time I was in they were showing a vhs of adverts from the 80's which made a talking point for a few minutes.   The main reason I like this place is that its a real ale bar that I can get my Cider and lager in. All our group are catered for here from the whiskey/vodka drinkers to the real ale folks. Never eaten here before but what I have seen getting turned out looks very nice for pub grub.   All in thumbs up from me! :D",

It just oozes history and tradition!  This is an ideal place to meet up as a group, or just to have a quiet pint on your own in very pleasant relaxed surroundings. The bar features a number of guest beers and several continental lagers. There is something for everyone! Bar staff are normally young student types and very friendly. The Guildford does get rather busy at lunch times due to it's city centre location, but at other times is very pleasant. A must visit pub if you are into traditional Victorian Edinburgh pubs!",

    "text": "The Guilford Arms is a great pub, the decor is great and has a very Victorian feel to it. The range of real ales that Guilford offers is very impressive and throughout the year they have a special ale that is offered. The prices are quite expensive but if you are into your real ales, there aren't many places around that would be able to compete with the Guilford Arms for choice. However, as I'm not that into my real ales the choice of drink was not much better than you would get in most pubs, but at a slightly higher than average price. Due to its central location. it can become quite busy in the evenings when the office workers finish and make use of the restaurant service. This added to the fact that it is located right next to a backpackers hostel means that there is a varied crowd, which actually adds to the atmosphere.",

You see my town back home is Guildford and after half heartedly researching I discovered nothing other than an attractive old pub, but never mind.  This place is supposed to be very good for its real ales and I'm told they are very good, but I couldn't really give you a first hand opinion as despite visiting many real ale specialists back home I'm not a great fan of them and they all taste the same to me.  Despite this I can recognise this, and rather ironically, for the traditional pubs back home you find out in the sticks that offer similar traditional drinks and atmosphere.  Fortunately, this one is a bit easier to get to.",

    "text": "Another of my favourite pubs. Stunning Victorian interior, ornate ceiling, beautiful old bar and gantry, really nice place. Maybe not quite as strong a visual impact as the Cafe Royal next door due to its rambling size, but the upside of that is that you have a much better chance of grabbing a seat. It does get busy enough to be standing room only at times, but you can usually get a seat even then if you're prepared to stand for 15 minutes or so.  It's a traditional pub with up to ten real ales on the go at any one time, plus a range of lagers on tap and the usual bottled stuff behind the bar. For me the only downside is the football on the tv which can create crowds of people standing right in front of the bar when you want to get served. And again, the size can be a good or a bad thing, as it means the pub doesn't have the intimacy and cosiness of a smaller place. But then if you grab the wee snug right up the back then you're onto a winner.  This might actually be my most frequented pub because its central location close to Waverley makes it a handy spot for meeting people. And it usually has beer from my favourite brewers like Harviestoun and Fyne Ales.  So. Traditional, ornate interior, loads of good real ale, a decent amount of room and seating, central location. What's not to like?",

In fact, it isn't so little as it has the main bar, a little hidden cove area down half a level with a few tables then a restaurant upstairs as well.    It is slightly bordering on an older man's boozer however don't let this put you off as you won't be hassled by them or even notice this so much.  It is older clientele who frequent this place but that just means that you'll have a good night without being bothered.    They serve a decent pint, offer better wine than a lot of pubs and you can also buy little bowls of nuts to nibble on whilst supping your tipple.",

Tucked away around the back of the illustrious walls of Burger King, is a collection of pubs including the Guildford Arms, Cafe Royal and the Voodoo Rooms. My visit to the Guildford Arms was through no mere accident, but nay, it was to see FC Ukelele play. Turns out, half of Edinburgh also wanted to see them and the Yard of Ale play - the pub was entirely packed out.   So what can I tell you? The bar was impossible to get to, but there was a mini bar setup at the back which we setup camp near. Less offerings, but avoided going near the crowds at the front. Win! Toilets were clean. There was a restaurant upstairs, but my arms were built for drinkin' that night. The bands had a mini stage up at the front so even those in the cheap seats could see them perform. Folks were up and dancing around us. Really, it was just a fantastic night - staggering out sozzled and nattering to ladies on the bus all the way home.",

    "text": "We decided to try this place out based on the reviews of a couple local Elites. Fantastic experiences both nights we went. First off, the decor is Victorian-decadent and feels classy, modern and welcoming. There are a variety of places to sit -- tables, booths, nooks and crannies -- and you can expect a full house if you're here alongside the after-work crowd.  There's a large variety of ales on tap, so don't be afraid to ask the barkeeps for suggestions. Naturally, there's a fine selection of single malts available as well. Prices are very reasonable, especially for being a skip off of Princes Street.  If you need something a little more substantial than a few good ales to fill your belly, Guildford Arms also offers gourmet pub grub, from classic fish and chips to your obligatory haggis, neeps and tatties. I tried the Angus steak pie. It came out piping hot and a was a savory little boat full of meat and gravy. Comfort food for grey, cold evening, for sure. There's also a tiny dining area upstairs that overlooks the rest of the pub. Up there, they have an expanded menu featuring a number a entrees. I suppose I'd call it the American section, as that's exactly who the area was full of when we were there (ourselves included).",

    "text": "We really loved this place. The decor inside was gorgeous and yet it still had the feel of a local pub. The bartenders were attentive and friendly and knowledgeable about ales. The food was perfect. It's in a good location in that it's just set back from Princes Street, which means that it's close to lots of other places but not right on the busy thoroughfare. If you're looking for something that feels authentic but is a little nicer than your typical pub, this is where to go.",

The bartenders were all cool and accommodating.  The cask ales are all local and refreshing.  The meat pies and mash...I can eat this every day of my life.  Cheers, mate.",

The place is really amazing to just be in with the high ceilings and the Victorian decor. As for the food, it was fantastic (had the lamb chops which were perfectly cooked).  To top it off, the service there was great.  Our waitress was an absolute delight.",
