    "text": "I love this elegant and sophisticated restaurant. My husband and I went there twice during our honeymoon stay in Edinburgh. The location was very close to our hotel, The Edinburgh Grand, walking distance of about 3 minutes.   The food was great and the service was amazing. I was on the wheelchair, and needed some help when we entered the restaurant or got seated at our table, but they kindly supported me and made me feel very comfortable and relaxed with their hospitality and kindness.   Our first visit, we tried their full Scottish breakfast menu. Everything was so delicious.  It was my first time to try Haggis in Scotland which I enjoyed a lot. Our second time, we enjoyed their afternoon tea menu with a lovely cocktail. I found this pretty cocktail picture from their Instagram, but couldn't find the name. When I told our waitress that I wanted to have the same cocktail by showing the picture, she brought the exact cocktail that I wanted. The afternoon tea menu was so cute and delicious. The motif of butterfly was very unique and lovely.   We will definitely go back there if we have a chance to visit Edinburgh again in our future.",

    "text": "WHAT AN EXPERIENCE!!!!  My daughter, wife, and I were advised by a local Scot to call and make a reservation requesting to be upstairs and near the windows. I'm so glad we did that as It was gorgeous!  Then we ordered wine and a gin and tonic and chatted about our trip thus far. At precisely the right amount of time our waiter Eduardo returned to take our orders. I always love it when waiters do not have to write down the orders- it's such a rare talent! The food arrived perfect to order and it was scrumptious!  Then, in what seemed for my wife and daughter a radical departure in my modis operandi -- I ordered a dessert! GASP!!! *crowd whispers to themselves for such a dramatic change of events  I explained that I was not having a stroke but rather my actions were based upon the recommendation of the local Scot! After all, when a man kilted in the Tartan of his clan tells you to do something- well by god you do it! And again, we were ecstatic that I did as the apple tart flambe was prepared and lit table-side by our waiter and the flames poured over the top caramelizing it as we watched in utter joy, anticipation, and profusely salivating. (Ok that adjective was a bit much, but you get the picture) and in case you needed an olfactory cue how's this: the flames made the whole dining room smell of apple pie!  The Ivy in Edinburgh is a fantastic restaurant with excellent food, great drinks, gorgeous ambiance, but at the top of the list was their staff: from the hosts, bar tenders, and the servers  were tremendous! Truly, a must!",

The space here is beautiful! It feels like you've been transported to a beautiful lush garden. We sat at a 4 top in the front of the restaurant, the chairs were so comfy and plush.   My friend and I imbibed in some brunch cocktails. I had the Bloody Mary, def reco. We also had coffee for the table- which was served in individual silver pots, coffee was strong and delicious.   For entrees I had the salmon and asparagus, my husband had the burger and our 2 friends both had the shepherds pie. Presentation was beautiful. My salmon was cooked perfectly and came with a side of delicious creamy champagne sauce. My husbands burger was good, but the the fries may have stole the show. Soo crispy and delicious.   Service here was super attentive and friendly, while getting us in and out quickly. Def stop here for a meal if you're in the area!",

We arrived a few minutes before 11 and unfortunately they do not serve breakfast/brunch after 11.  We decided to stay for lunch and we were definitely not disappointed.    The Ivy is a bit fancier than other places you may find in Edinburgh.  But no worries... you can still wear your casual Tourist apparel As most people are walking around the city and come in for a meal.    The service was excellent as the wait staff was super friendly.  Being an American,  friendly waitstaff means a lot.  The food was also very delicious.  I got the shepherds pie which was mixed with beef and lamb.  I don't love lamb but this was super tasty and flavorful.  It came with a side of aus jus that I literally could have just drank.  For being a heavier dish this was not that filling.  I was fine to walk around without feeling completely stuffed.  My friend got the salmon and asparagus with the champagne sauce and she said it was also really delicious.    If ever in Edinburgh again I would definitely want to go back for breakfast as I saw some peoples plates while walking by and it looked heavenly.",

They are big on the current trend towards gin-based cocktails.   Food is very high quality - best of the night was the roasted sea bass. Beautifully prepared and presented.  Don't skip the bread and butter - even though they charge for it, it is well worth the price.  Only I had dessert - a goblet of fresh ice cream with fresh berry coulis.  It was fantastic.  The one disappointment was the fish and chips - the batter outweighed the fish and it was bland and uninspiring for a restaurant of this caliber.",

    "text": "The Ivy in London is practically a historical institution. The Edinburgh outpost does not tarnish its good name. Despite me not having a reservation, the lovely ladies at the front welcomed me to be seated. I immediately fell in love with the art-deco design of the restaurant.   My table was on the second floor, providing a great nighttime view of the city. The server was kind enough to check my coat as well. This same high quality of service was consistent throughout the entire meal.  For a starter, I had the tempura prawns with salt and pepper squid, which came with a wasabi miso sauce. My main course was the lobster linguine, a very nice tomato-based pasta dish. The apple tart fine for dessert was probably the highlight of the meal. This was topped with ice cream then flambeed at the table using hot brandy. It has been nearly a year since this meal and it has clearly left a lasting memory!  I definitely look forward to dining here again or at the London location in the near future!",

I was even finishing the beans! I cleaned out the plate very nicely. Everything was tasty and fresh. The service was impeccable and you know they are well-trained and they cared.  Highly recommend for any occasion. Of course the cute decor and colorful furniture added so much value to The Ivy.",

Couple that with a good wine menu with some decent whites and reds for 28-38 and it's a winner! I have just found out there is one of the franchises near where I live so I will give that a try to compare. If you are in Edinburgh and want really decent food at reasonable prices then it's a good bet. The staff were friendly and attentive without being intrusive also!",
