So I gave them a chance.  We weren't sure what to order so to play safe, we ordered the Set Meal for 2B which consists of : 2 Miso Soup 2 Chicken skewers 6 Japanese dumplings 4 pieces of California roll 6 pieces of Chef's choice nigiri 4 pieces of Salmon sashimi Teriyaki chicken rice  There was one roll that stood out the most - Chef's Special Roll !!!! I have never tasted this anywhere, I loved this roll out of the entire meal. The crunchy thin layer on the top reminded me of sweet  cracker-like, but I didn't get a chance to ask them what it was.  King Prawn Tempura Roll was an extra roll that we ordered. Just crunchy.  We didn't finish it so we brought a good sum of it home. \"He\" seem to love the teriyaki chicken rice and the chicken skewers once we got home.  You can take the 44 bus here. They get an extra star for the service. And thanks for extra ginger.",

Called them up, the lady working was very apologetic and had a driver come and bring us the missing items ASAP. Still though, the other food got cold.  The vegetable tempura was a gross mass if shredded veggies. The gyoza didn't taste fresh, the dough was chewy and rubbery. This upsets me greatly as the number of decent places that deliver good food to my post code has now dwindled to 1.   Would no longer recommend as the food seems to have gone down in quality .",

Last visit saw me tuck into the set menu - it was an absolutely massive feed and all for something like 15 per person. There was a full plate of California rolls, teriyaki chicken, miso soup, dumplings, and something else I can't remember now! SO tasty.   The decor is bright and modern and the waiting staff are always friendly and pleasant. I haven't had a bad experience here so will continue to stuff my face with ramen and wasabi peas. Nom.  Oh! One thing to mention is probably to avoid desserts. They are pre-packaged and straight out the freezer. But forgive them - the Japanese grub makes up for it! :)",

Most of the flavor unfortunately came from the spicy sauce and the mayo sauce, but the mackerel was tasty and the avocado nice and ripe. It wasn't my style of sushi (generally I like as little saucing-up of the fish as possible, the Truest and freshest flavors you can get) but I can imagine it would be perfect for others. However, the service was pretty atrocious. I was the only person in the restaurant (sushiya next door was packed and I wanted to taste the competition) and yet still the waitress completely ignored me. There is giving a guest space and there is ignoring a guest. I was ignored.",

    "text": "Love Hay Sushi.   I've been here a few times but I must say that recently they've really upped their game, particularly the tempura which previously lacked 'lightness' but now is divine.  Their soft shell crab rolls are to die for, ah-may-zing. I'm a maki girl myself and they do a good'un (or six). The price is pretty alright too. Their Special-Seafood Udon runs just under 12 which is reasonable, I've expected up to 16 for that kind of dish in other places. Most dishes are 8-11 while smaller ones are 4-6. So abig dish and a small dish well fills you and doesn't break the bank!  Atmosphere is friendly, staff are helpful and quite thoughtful. The layout is ok, you can see the sushi guy behind the counter (Oh the excitement!) However, I've been informed the decor, which isn't luxurious by any stretch,  is not traditional Japanese (I wouldn't know...) but is probably the closest out of all the sushi restaurants in Edinburgh (not my opinion...I really don't know!)  I have a slight issue with the loo. The ladies makes me think of a prefab just stuck on the corner, and you can here every word that is said in the restaurant while you're in there. This makes for uncomfortable peeing.  If you've got a sushi-craving definitely give it a go, you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Hay Sushi served up a perfectly delicious sushi/sashimi bento box. I didn't have any issue with quality of the fish - it felt and tasted fresh enough to me. The miso soup was some of the best in a town where my main experience of miso has been rather... flavourless in other restaurants, even ones where I have raved about the rest of the food. Service was restrained, and could be seen as slow, but for me it was fine. I had 40mins to order, eat, pay and walk to my appointment, and I made it all in plenty of time without rush. Would I be happy to return to Hay Sushi again? Perfectly!",

    "text": "Being a big sushi fan I have tried many different places in Edinburgh, and Hay Sushi has had 2 visits from me.  Both times I have been suitably impressed with the relaxed friendly atmosphere, its clean and spacious and the staff have always been more polite and helpful.  The food is where is starts to take a dip, the majority of the things I have tried have been average to good, but with a decent number of sushi restaurants around you pretty special to stand out.  Just basic things like edamame beans, both times they have been massively overdone, the salmon sashimi didnt taste the most fresh the second time and they didn't have any tuna, which seems a bit short sighted on a Friday night when its such an integral part to many Sushi dishes.  Hand rolls and prawn tempura rolls were good, but again nothing mind blowing.  I have to say though that although I put the food in the \"average to good\" category (hence the 3 stars) the prices are very reasonable, with even items that I would expect to pay over 10 for coming in around 7 or 8 and they have a good selection of bento style boxes that make a quick and cheap lunch.  All in all, for a quick, reasonably priced and perfectly enjoyable Japanese meal, check it out, just don't expect to be blown away.",

I also didn't appreciate the waitress constantly coughing. There menu is badly laid out and worded, as they have a double sided card that shows some set menus and bento boxes. There are two types of bento box, and the wording beside one states it's for lunch only, but this actually applies to them both and needs to be clearer. There was a man collecting a take away order while we were in and he had to come back into the restuarant 3 or 4 times to collect the missing pieces! I have been back since by myself, but no, this place isn't for me.",

It doesn't seem like it's really sushi-grade, and it's always served barely cool-ish or lukewarm. I've tried them about five different times and been seriously grossed out every time. Unfortunately their area is very short on sushi places that deliver, so if you're desperate for some Japanese food and really need it delivered maybe order from here but only get cooked dishes. If you're going to sit in the restaurant or are willing to pick up, skip it and go to Sushiya. It's one or two doors up the road and is a million times better.",

    "text": "I absolutely love Hay sushi! This wasn't always the case. My 1st time there, I wasn't very impressed,... the food was decent but the lack of spark & atmosphere kind of ruined it for me. After coming back a few times & trying a lot more on the menu, I realised that the food is just fantastic & the other things can be over looked! The restaurant itself seems a little too big for the amount of customers it gets,... which always makes it look empty!! Not the most appealing sign to welcome someone in, but I think it is just too many chairs & tables!  Anyway, down to the really important stuff... the food! The food is fab, you get free wasabi peas at the start & mints at the end too, very cute! They have a fab range of sushi, sashimi, cooked meats, bento boxes, noodles... you name it! The menu is REALLY easy to follow & simple to order, it has lots of pictures too... always seem to tempt me & boyfriend into buying more! The best thing is the choice of maki rolls...not just your standard ones, they have a huge range of creative exciting large rolls, mostly made to tempt a Western sushi palate. Try the ocean roll....yumm!!! my mouth is watering just thinking about it! Also the simple avocado rolls are always perfect, you get loads. Money wise its fairly average, you do get 10% off if you take away too. Service is decent, not too attentive - they sort of leave you be so depends on what you like. Personally I don't like to be pestered while i'm eating.  So... all in all I would come here for a nice quick bite, take away and to try some new flavours... but would recommend somewhere else for a long dining experience or special occasion",

The pork was fried with egg and served in slices, toped with sesame and dry seaweed(hope i am right).
