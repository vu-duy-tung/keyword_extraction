The Chicken greek salad, the Chicken gyros and the wine were so amazing that we ate there multiple times during our 2 night stay.  The owner and his family were so friendly and efficient. Probably one of the BEST meals we had on our 17 day U.K. trip.",

    "text": "An original Greek souvlaki (pork skewer) and mpifteki (beef mince meat with herbs)?  With home-made fries? Tzatziki (garlic yoghurt salad) and other Greek dishes?   And some original Greek soft drinks and the famous Greek pitta bread?   Oh yes!!! I was looking forward to trying out this place!   Things I wasn't impressed with: on the souvlaki portion (three pork skeweres, pitta bread, some chopped tomatoes and onions along with chips) there was no tzatziki! Come on, you guys are all Greek in there and you should now that these things go together.   No alcohol served, at least for now.   On my 2nd visit the service was good and punctual, around 6-7 people working in it. It's not an actual restaurant, it's closer to a kebab place I would say, but believe me, you need to try it (at least once!).   Now about my first visit... Well, it was on the 2nd day they opened, three people only working there, people standing in the queue waiting to order, and giving up after 15 minutes or so. I was lucky enough to find a sit, while my persistent friend was standing right on the cashier to give an order: it took 35 mins to just give the order and another 15 mins to be served!!! We were not happy at all, but we were hungry and wanted badly to try their food.   Will I go back? Yes, assuming there's no big queue!!",

    "text": "Their food is still good and authentic, but I have to pay extra for tzatziki (yougurt sauce) in my gyros. Given the prices of the place they should include it like every greek place does or even raise the price of it but not charge us an extra for it, that's a joke (and a bad one). At least they fixed the option to add tzatziki sauce in the gyros ithrough online delivery (via deliveroo), because initially we had to call them each time to add it at the order and the staff was giving us attitude because the charge had already been made online (not our fault though.)",

There are about only 3 places I eat in Edinburgh. Scran and Scallie (they allow dogs), Imperial Palace (dim sum cravings) and here at Ola Kala.   My standard order now is maybe the feta cheese dip, a pita, the potatoes with kefalortiri, main course of gyros and a green greek coke. Oh also you have to try the square baklava. Is made with walnuts and cinnamon. Some of the best I have ever tried.   Also they have tables outside for summer.   TLDR - Still the best kebab (gyros) in Edinburgh if not Scotland.",
