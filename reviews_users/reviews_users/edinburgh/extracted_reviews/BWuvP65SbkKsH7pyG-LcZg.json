    "text": "This is a hidden gem for pretty much anyone who doesn't work at Exchange Place or live around fountainbridge. The outside is in keeping with the ultramodern office development but inside its a fresh, comfortable but contemporary and spotlessly clean interior. Chatty staff who I wanted to talk to about buying a penguin picture from and she took my details and said she'd put me in touch directly with the artist.   So the coffee. Sourced from a Glasgow roaster named Matthew Algie they are medium strength and very fresh. I had a double shot latte and it didn't blow my head off, which is quite refreshing.    They also do loose leaf tea supplied by Loveleaf. They have a signature garden-fresh mint tea as you would expect from the name. Food wise, soup seems to be the popular dish, with a couple of options, plus a selection of filled rolls/paninis. 4-5 different homemade cakes finished off the small but well designed menu.   I came at half past two so there were only four customers but I'd imagine it gets busy around lunchtime with office workers descending on the place like caffeine deprived... Well, office workers. It was surprisingly peaceful place, and I could imagine coming here to revise for exams or plan a new project. Bright and warm.   For those coffee drinkers with an eye for hand decoration, they apparently do a nail bar on Thursday and Friday. Book yourself in!  Oh and they sell freshly cut flowers so if you need a last minute bouquet after work you know where to come.",

    "text": "Popped in here for a quick lunch as I was based in the area, and was happy to see a large selection of sandwiches all for great value. The cafe itself is very modern and fresh, but not sterile and the friendly staff were great to chat to while waiting.  I opted for a cheese and leek toastie that hit the spot, and only cost 3.50 to boot. While I wouldn't really order it again, the huge choice of sandwiches will definitely bring me back again.   The reason why I've only opted for 3 stars instead of 4 though is that this part of Edinburgh has a LOT of competition for sandwich shops. Personally I think Armstrong's Deli or Hank's Sandwich are just fantastic and better in comparison, however, they do offer different variations etc. If I had a hankering for a good classic sandwich with standard bread, Mint cafe would be my first choice!",

I love the little touches too, how the milk comes in little milk bottles and the butter dishes are a delight and a jug of water to help yourself too. I love it here, would highly reccommend.",

    "text": "Newly opened Mint is hidden amongst corporate office space in the Exchange Place complex between Fountainbridge and Semple Street. It has a clean & contemporary, yet arty feel; decor is a mix of comfy couches, bar stools to watch the world go by, and small tables. The lovingly prepared sweet and savoury bites look a delight! There are the classics: shortbread, millionaires shortbread, chocolate fudge brownie; as well as fancier tastes, including decorated mint cupcakes If the mature cheddar and bacon muffin (1.30) is anything to go by, they taste even better than they look! The staff are friendly, chatty and helpful. First impressions of the coffee is mixed. While there was too much micro-foam on my flat white (2.15, regular, takeaway) the consistency was right, but the coffee itself tasted a little over-roasted and over-extracted.",
