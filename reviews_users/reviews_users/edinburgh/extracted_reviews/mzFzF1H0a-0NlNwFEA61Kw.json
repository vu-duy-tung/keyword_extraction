    "text": "This is a hole in wall taco place and so good.   It was a rainy day so I don't think think the employee anticipated how many pick up orders were coming through as well as a few parties coming in. He explained the situation, apologized, and said he reached out to a co-worker to come help. Poor guy was hustling.   With that, when he made my tacos, they were a bit sloppy but since he was rushed - he loaded them!  I got the hard tacos with barbocoa beef. Very tasty!! I couldn't finish al 3 since they were so loaded.   They had so many condiments to choose from at a counter away from the food order spot. We food a couple of bar stool seats on a ledge facing the window.   I'm glad we stopped in here and surprised how well Scotland can do Mexican!",

The food tastier bland and I saw the girl behind the counter spraying cleaner on the place where all the food was to clean it and I'm sure cleaner got in to the food. The chips were like  aging cardboard and stale. The only good thing is it was cheap. We got a chicken burrito and chicken quesadilla and chips and guacamole for under 20 pounds. But I would get your Tex Mex fix somewhere else!",

We enjoyed the pork burrito the most and my 4 year old son really loved his quesadillas. Definitely recommend this place !",

Mexican street food is always delicious and considering their very central location its cheap too! The options make it quick and easy to order, your food is prepared right there and then. The chill vibe and friendly staff definitely have my support. Mexican street food is great!",

    "text": "I ate there last night with my family. We are visiting out of country and have tasted some great Mexican food from California, the American Southwest, and Texas. What we ate last night was not Mexican food, or even palatable food at all. The food was the most flavorless, bland, and unseasoned food I have eaten in my life and my family agrees. We ordered buritos, three tacos, and a quesadilla. All three of those foods were awful! There was too much rice, flavorless beans, and unseasoned and runny meat within the burritos and the tacos. Also, the tacos shells were very stale and chewy. The quesadilla had too much salsa (with corn, which was strange) and meat. Not only was the food very unsatisfying (and expensive), the professionalism of the cooks was lacking as well. Their customer service was very poor, as they cracked jokes and smiled at each other while the line grew not only within the restaurant  but also the take out orders. They were in fact behind by several call-in orders. All in all, if my family and I could give this place half a star, we would gladly. Tourists, stay away from this place!",
