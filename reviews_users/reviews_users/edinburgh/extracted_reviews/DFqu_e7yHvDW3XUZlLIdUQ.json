The staff were nice and the coffee is good which is why it got 3 stars rather than one.  I think the location saves this place rather than the quality of the decor.",

You can, on the other hand, sit under the phenomenally powerful and cold air conditioning unit at the back. I usually go for a takeaway - they do make great coffee and the snacks (although expensive) are good. The sandwiches are also usually very good.",
