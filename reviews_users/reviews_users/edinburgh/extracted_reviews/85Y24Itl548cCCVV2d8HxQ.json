    "text": "Review from visit July 2010.   Was with my parents so wanted it to be a fantastic dining experience, and it just wasn't.   The food was good - we did the early dinner prix fixe special (portions a bit awkward, tiny 1st plates with enormous 2nd plates.)  My problem was the service. We had a reservation, and the place was NOT crowded atall. Even so, service was below average. We waited a solid 10 minutes before getting waters or drink menus. After that, it wasn't clear who was our server. 4 different people came to bring us things throughout the night, no one made a clear introduction or greeting at the beginning.   So overall this left a bad taste in my mouth. Perhaps I was particularly sensitive as I wanted my parents to feel welcomed to my city. Service was bad enough that I wouldn't return despite the good food. I'd rather keep looking around for a place that meets exceptional standards across the board.",

Not so keen on eels)  I had never ever fancied fish curry until I saw it on the menu in this gorgeous restaurant/bistro, and I can honestly say it was beyond fantastical. Yummyness which knows no bounds. Wow. I can't even praise it enough.  The Kerala red fish curry, which was packed with pollock and prawns too, was outstanding. It had just the right amount of spice, and packed full of fishy goodness. The rice was fragrant, which complimented the fish and spices beautifully. I think you get the picture, but WOW! I urge you to try it.  As well as gorgeous food, beautifully understated surroundings and a menu which caters for us fish-lovers, the prices are incredibly good value for money. My fish curry (did I mention it was AWESOME?) only cost 13.95, which is probably much less than the quantity of seafood in it is actually worth at cost price!   Perfection. If you love fish, you will absolutely love Fishers in the City.",

Their menu is really good (if maybe a bit small, but that suits me fine) and they always have some specials. I must say though - if you go here on this recommendation then you have to have the mussels too. They have a smaller starter portion and a large main, but to be honest the starter is more than enough! I was too full for my halibut after the mussels. If you're a mussels fan - or even if you're not - try these mussels. D.E.L.I.C.I.O.U.S!!!!!!  They always have a meat option too if you don't fancy fish.  The bad thing about Fishers is the toilets...or lack thereof! They need more than one!!",

I had the waiter recommended Orkney Scallops, and while I thought the use of the smoked salmon hollandaise was interesting, the creamy sauce was too overwhelming  for the scallops, in my opinion.  I'd be willing to give this restaurant another try, next time I'm in town, but for now, it was just ok.",

The wine list was extensivewe chose the Pouilly-Fume, which complemented our meals perfectly. The mussels were perfect, and the scallops some of the best I've ever tasted. The monkfish (seasonal) was good enough to make the eater chew with their eyes closed.   Attentive and efficient service, but not too attentive. Smart-casual, trendy crowd. Our only complain was that we were sat in the middle of the room and this lessened the romantic element a bitadmittedly, this is a peeve of mine. Overall, a great meal in a pleasant atmosphere!",

Obviously their main dish is fish, they do some non-fish dishes but not many (I saw veal on menu last time I was there).  The portions are pretty large. If going for the mussels ask for the starter portion, believe me its enough for most. The mussels in white wine sauce is one of their most popular dishes and is divine, it comes with crusty bread. Their second most popular dish is their fish cakes with sweet chilli sauce. Specials are available every day and I've seen them range from sea bass, monkfish to swordfish.   This isn't a cheap restaurant but a bowl of mussels and a glass of wine will set you back about ten pounds which isn't bad. The staff are friendly and helpful and even when the place is packed you don't feel hemmed in, I don't know how they've managed it but it feels quite spacious even when full.",

Nestled away from the boutique hotels, cavernous pubs, and pretentious lounges of George Street, Fishers in the City is an oasis of calm and understated confidence in its own quality, with professional, unhurriedly gracious staff cleverly balancing their approach between over-familarity and cold supersilience. A joy to be steered from entrance to table, with an aperitif at the well-stocked bar on the way, and helpfully guided through the excellent menu and competent wine list. Whoever trains the staff deserves compliments. All this is nothing without commensurate qualities in the food cooking and presentation and here again we have nothing but plaudits. A surprise lunch for two booked by my wife to mark my recent 60th was our latest visit. More usually evening patrons of Fishers, I soon had any hint of reservation on my part dispelled and the lunch was without doubt one of the high spots of my birthday celebrations.",

Consistently amazing food is the the aim of every restaurant I would imagine, and Fishers has certainly succeeded in attaining this. Not once have I ever come in here and found something to be tasteless, bland, or anything less than delicious. Neither has my food ever arrived late, plus the staff are always charming and accommodating.   The menu changes quite regularly at Fishers, but my personal recommendations from the regular menu fixtures would be the mussels, with whatever yummy sauce of the day is on offer, the fish cakes and the eternally fantastic scallops. And if you're not an avid seafood enthusiast, no stress required, there are always meat and veggie options to be had from the menu. Very reasonably priced for the generous portions and quality of food, so if you are arranging any kind of dinner that just has to be good, or else there'll be dubious consequences (first dinner with potential inlaws, clients you need to make a deal with, someone you want to manipulate into loving you through feeding them, you get the picture), then this is your place, I'm telling you.",

As soon as you walk in, you see why everyone raves about how beautiful it is; I love the huge L-shaped aquarium that lines almost two entire walls of the raised area where we sat.  One thing I did think was cheeky though, was that despite my friend having phoned ahead to reserve a table for their Table D'Hote lunch menu, the waiter only gave us the A La Carte one. Which would have been fine, except that two courses from the set menu cost less than one single main course from the A La Carte. When we asked another waitress she brought us the set menu straightaway, but it annoyed me the way they were just trying to sneak as much money out of us as possible.  Rant over, the food was incredible. I honestly can't remember what my friend had, as I was so engrossed in my own food, it was that good! My starter of mackerel with a pine nut and green bean salad was really well-presented, and the drizzle of mint pesto around the edge added that extra little touch. But it was my main course that really trumped it: a huge fillet of seared coley sitting on a bed of greens and swimming in a shrimp and mussel bisque, and I'm actually getting hungry just writing about it. If they did takeaway I'm fairly sure I'd have my phone in my hand right now...  The fact that they do at least half a dozen different wines by the glass was also a definite plus point, and they were really reasonably priced considering the quality.  I think it's safe to say I will definitely be going back.",

Overall, we said: \"Fishers in the City serves pretty good dishes, with good local ingredients, but somehow doesn't quite hit the mark, for me. I enjoyed the soup, muchly, and the lemon sole was lovely, but a little clearer thought needs applied to the construction of the dishes, to ensure that the best is made from the star ingredients. The business is making its money from tourist trade, and more power to its elbow for that, so my quibbles are less relevant to how they shape their service than those of their international clientele. I think there's room for improvement, but that improvement needs to ensure that it capitalises upon their current broad appeal.\"",

I really enjoy sitting at an old wooden table on the top level of the split-nautical fishy themed restaurant looking out over quiet Thistle Street.  When I left an old job they bought me, (amongst other things such as bad joke toilet paper and lots of packets of space raiders) a voucher to eat here - I was chuffed, not only because I never pass off a free meal and also having eaten here before, it certainly fills my fishy soft spot (sounds a bit rank-dirty eh?!)  Fresh, well cooked fish isn't the only thing you can get on the venue but it would be completely pointless to chose this if you weren't into things from the wet.  Friendly, professional staff (who to be honest always look like they're having a bad day, but try to hide it well) and fast table service.. Another bottle of wine? Bam, it's the there.",

Well, I didn't like it, but I think I just understood curry&seafood is not a very good idea for me. And in the end the sticky toffee was wonderful.  Pricing is fair - it was 50 pounds overall. Try have 16 pounds for a full course and that's how we got the soup, curry and toffee, but the oysters are individually not part of this. Overall - highly recommended!",

As so what i had well this will come to no shock to many but I started off with a beautiful plate of oysters! Just stunning, fresh as can be and taste like the sea! (hold on the rhymes career in advertising here I come).  For main I had the bengali fish curry, now i wont for a second try and say whether or not it was authetntic but damn was it tasty. It was that kind of spicy there you mouth is kind of burnign but you dont care cause all of the falvours are just tremendous. If i had to criticise I would say would be nice to have some flatbread with it.  Desert was rhubarb trifle, really nice young rhubarb that had a beautiful biiter/sweet flavour.  JD = HAPPY man!!",

As a starter I had the crab cake which was crunchy and tasted very good. As a main dish we ordered a sea food platter for two with lobster, oysters, clams, crabs and other kind of sea food. The portions were impressive and the prize was reasonable. My visit at Fishers was even better than expected. I can really recommend Fishers in the City and in Leith too.",

    "text": "We read the reviews before making reservations at Fisher and were excited to have a nice dinner celebrating my birthday. We were 15 minutes early, 5:30 pm and the restaurant was quite empty.  The host seated us at a tiny table right next to the work station where all the glasses, water pitchers and utensils were. The other side is the kitchen counter.  I politely asked if we can seat at the empty table away from the work station (there were at least 4 tables available).  The hostess was not happy but agreed to seat us in one of the table.    We ordered two starters and two main dishes and I was not impressed.  The lobster salad was good but my fish was over cook and lack of taste. My husband order beef starter and cod fish and he said the fish had no taste but the beef was excellent.  While we were dining, tables started to fill up.  Our waitress seemed to be disappeared but there was a male server going around to greet the customers and asked if they were doing fine but not once, came to ask if we needed anything or how our meal was.    We felt ignored and I finally asked this male waiter to get our waitress.  He said, I'm your server!  The waitress has gone home.   Can I help you? Oh I said, can we get our bill?  No asking if we want desert or how the dinner was.  I won't recommend this restaurant and I won't be back for sure; the service is bad and the food is just average.  We are from California and have traveled to many countries but never felt being treated differently because we are Asian!  This is the first...and by the way my husband is American born speaking perfect English.",

Absolute bargain and left feeling warm and very satisfied.   The only reason why this isn't a 5 star is down to the service. Although everyone was pleasant, we felt the waitress was a bit pushy trying to increase the bill with extra starters and trying to sell us wine even though we weren't drinking.

We popped in for lunch - not the cheapest place in town but eating seafood in Scotland usually is an expensive business. I went for the lunch special - langoustines with scallops (23). I was pleased to see they served the scallops with roe on them - yes! Lots of people remove this which is just plain wrong and the scallops were decently sized - unfortunately one of my scallops was missing the roe :-(  Langoustines were perfectly cooked and really great. Eating shellfish can be a messy business but all the required 'equipment' was provided.  Service - good, left to chat and the occasional enquiry if we needed anything else but apart from that, all good. A glass of Sancerre went with the seafood and we ordered some chips on the side (salad came with the shellfish). The chips were ok, nothing special.  Staff can advise what is Gluten Free (GF) but no GF bread available.  So, decently, well prepared seafood in the centre of town.",

    "text": "I've glanced at Fishers so many times, but the menu has never really leapt out at me, until tonight. We were roaming around seeking inspiration for an impromptu meal out, and after a few lacklustre 'hmm I guess that would do...' menus, we came across Fishers, and both of us lit up. I tucked into the spiced aubergine soup (tasty and spicy, with nice texture from almond slices) and penang curry which was lovely and had the perfect level of spice for me. The pineapple chutney was fantastic, the fruity flavour cut nicely through the rich coconut. The SR had the deluxe fish and chips (fish and battered prawns), some fantastic looking chips. I didn't get a look in, but then again, neither did he, we both jealously guarded our plates.   It's not a 5 star, I did think the service was at times a little too hovery, and I was floored when I saw the price of the curry (20)... I am not 100% convinced that although it was lovely, it was 20 lovely. But, saying that, I'd definitely recommend to others, and hope to return at some point as well.",

    "text": "Okay, I just need to say wow and start off with talking about dessert. I'm literally still thinking about the sticky toffee pudding we just had. It was hot and served with butterscotch and cream, and for an extra 50 pence you can have it with ice cream, which I would suggest is a must! It was seriously to die for. I was fortunate enough that I was still able to order from the pre-theatre menu even though it was after 6pm which meant I could order either a 2 course (15)or a 3 course meal for 18 Next up, (working backwards) was my main entree and I chose the Coley & King Prawn North Indian Curry, basmati rice. Again, this dish was fantastic and had the perfect amount of heat. My first course was also delicious. I chose the fishers fish stew and it is probably the best out of the three fish soups I've had since arriving in Scotland. If I have the opportunity to come back before my trip is over I would love to try the seafood platter. I noticed a few people around me order it and it looked amazing and was piled high with a variety of seafood including lobster and crab and was 95 for 2. I also noticed on their website that they have two other locations in Edinburgh with different menus. If the other two restaurants are anything like Fishers in the City you simply can't go wrong.",

    "text": "Good food, but horrible service.  See, the thing is, you're charging prices that are more or less aligned with a higher mid-range to lower high-end restaurant. So at least train your servers to match that.   We wanted to have a nice dinner, wanting to order three starters to more or less construct a 3-course tasting menu. So my husband and I ordered (each of us) oysters, followed by two starters. The bad things started there.  See, if I wanted to order three items, and I made it clear that I wanted to do a small tasting menu so to speak, then I would expect the server to get out of the mindset that there should be a starter and a main course. Instead, our server was so fixated at figuring out what the starter should be, what the main course should be, and what my pre-starter should be. It was so confusing, when all she needed to figure out was which dish should be delivered first, then next, then last. I speak English too, and fluently at that, but I was confused as hell because she kept on insisting that I should tell her what my main course was. When you're in tasting menu mode, then what is the main course becomes less clear, no?  In short, the staff should be aware that not every diner orders a starter followed by a main course. Adapt accordingly.  There was also the case of the missing spoon. I ordered a dish with some broth, served in a deep plate, but you won't give me a spoon?  Finally, there was a mistake on the bill, so we had to have it taken out.  So yeah, it is a pity to have good stuff coming out of the kitchen, but the staff's abilities doesn't match it. Train your staff better! There's plenty of small mistakes which do add up and together they make the experience unpalatable. Right now they don't match the prices you charge.",

The scallops were good, but a bit too much garlic in the shells so I had to take them out of the shells.  The dessert was also great, the chocolate cake fresh and rich with perfect other ingredients to balance and make it interesting.  The creme brulee was almost an example in how to do them.  This place is the upper end of prices, but earns  it's prices properly.  The decor is smart, warm and the people there  are sophisticated.  For a while I did feel like one of the them and us elite, although of course that for me is not the point!  To go for good fresh food in a smart restaurant this is a good choice.",

Starting with the good - the service was really friendly and efficient. The waitress informed us beforehand of what was not available (was easter weekend) so understandably certain things were sold out. I hate it when I make my mind up about what I'm going to order to only be told that the item is not available.   We ordered the following: 6 oysters Pan fried scallops Posh fish and chips (cod and jumbo shrimp) 8 langoustines  Oysters. - very good and fresh.   Pan fried scallops - Good, but would have liked to have tried the hand dived ones which were sold out. Fish and chips - average, no much flavour in the batter Langoustines - a real let down. It seemed like they may have dig them out of the freezer from a couple of years back and cooked them up because they were dreadful.  Soft powdery flesh. I should have sent them back, but I was hoping I would get one decent langoustine having ordered 8 of them.   All in all, disappointed.",
