    "text": "I rate Mania a solid four stars mainly because it's fast, cheap and pretty tasty. For those days when I want pizza delivered, I can get two 11in za's for less than 15 - and those two pizzas are fully loaded! (Note: both pizzas aren't mine!)  My go to pizza is the Hawaiian BBQ chicken. If you like mixing sweet and savoury - it's a good option! Delivery is free if you mention you have \"the coupon\". (The delivery person never asks for it).   They have lots of offers and also specialise in fried chicken and wraps. Oh and they have jalapeno poppers which are really yummy.   Mania also provides you with a creamy garlic dipping sauce with every pizza!",

    "text": "We were recommended this as an excellent hangover food place, and as it was around the xmas period this is exactly how we found ourselves. Ordered and they deliver quickly, in fact much quicker than stated while ordering. I was well impressed with this. The delivery driver was very polite too.  Now on to the food. We had been told of amazing pizzas and sides. We did receive a vast array of food for the price, but unfortunately this is where everything fell down a little. The pizza was really generic and didn't really have any redeeming qualities. The toppings were not the best either. The sides were all standard fair - jalapeno poppers etc so were as expected.   This was not a bad experience or a great one, just that slightly frustrating that the main aim of getting a pizza was not really up to spec. Great service, speedy delivery, but the food isn't great. Sigh thought I had found my hangover mecca from initial reports.",

    "text": "Major case of hit and miss here. The menu is pretty extensive and the prices are fair. The first time we had a takeaway it was genuinely amazing and all in our party vowed never to get pizza anywhere else. Unfortunately a few weeks later we ordered again but got cold pizza, incorrect sides and drinks and one pizza was slopped in half almost across the box. Despite a phone call and email complaints no apology or attempt to compensate was offered. Would now be reluctant to offer repeat buisness.",
