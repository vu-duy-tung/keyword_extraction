    "text": "The festive menu has some interesting twists, for food & drinks. The mulled sloe gin was a big hit.  The festive menu's salmon pate & pulled pork rilletes make a nice change to the usual offerings. We both enjoyed the spiced Persian lamb pizzas, which were huge. I had to get the rest of mine to take away - that's supper sorted:)  It doesn't take Tastecard over the holidays but the 18.95 for 2 courses & a glass of Prosecco is a decent offer.   Solid, friendly service. It's never going to be amazing but it's a decent/solid 3.5 stars.",

    "text": "Pizza Express has recently been a little more favoured by Anita and I. They do pizzas well.   We arrived a little early for our reservation, we sat down with a glass of very nice prosecco and some big green olives. Yum. On arrival of our other table guests we went over the available pizzas on the list, whilst snacking on more olives and almonds. Water was supplied and more bottles of prosecco were ordered.   Their Romana range is based on a thin & crispy base and topped with fresh ingredients. I went for a blue cheese, prosciutto and chicken with chili oil.  The taste was lovely - the chili oil was chili infused olive oil, and actually dripping of the pizza. I don't know if that was supposed to be that way, it was nice mind, but a little oily. For afters I chose a macchiato, this was nice and strong. We had some limoncello shots and made our way.   It was a nice meal, nothing too special. I do recommend this branch of Pizza Express as the feel is a little more.. classy. High ceilings, mezzanine and glass everywhere.   As with all Pizza Express restaurants - they have Cloud WiFi",

    "text": "Unfortunately as I work nearby, I eat here far more often than I want to.  I have been many, many times so my experience wasn't just a fluke but a common occurance.  Each and everytime I have been extremily disappointed to the point of anger.  The restaurant has been empty and when trying to order take aways we have been turned away as they were too busy apparently.  Also, when they did actually take our order on another occassion the pizzas weren't ready when they said they would be then when we went back to collect them they were cold as they had been lying out for so long!    Not only is the service despicable but the actual pizzas themselves aren't anything to write home about.  Rock solid, crunchy bases that make you scared that you will break a tooth are topped off with a stingey amount of cheese and perhaps a hot lettuce leaf or two if you're really lucky!    You've been warned.  Try it at your own risk!",

I love coming here during the festival because there's such a variety of people. The food is delicious too - I thoroughly recommend the Tuna Nicoise salad or the Chicken Pesto Pasta - YUMMY. The service is generally really quick, but I once came here before going to a concert and had to leave my entire meal - but they did give it to me for free! Overall it's a great branch to an already great restaurant!",

So we left. Walked by in a bit after eating elsewhere, and it was still mostly empty. Guess they didn't want our money.",

Check the internet before you go for vouchers for the company. There was a 10 special whilst we were there which was popular but with limited menu items. Tried to return over the holiday weekend but it was full, so book if possible.",
