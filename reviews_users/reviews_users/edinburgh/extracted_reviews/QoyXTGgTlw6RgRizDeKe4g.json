    "text": "There's a lot to like about Thomas J Walls; a coffee shop taking over an old opticians.  It's a pretty distinct venue, especially from the outside, and it's big so there is a decent chance of getting a seat even if it's busy.   I came here for brunch and wasn't disappointed. It's a bit different from the usual including some decent looking potato rosti dishes. I went for the sriracha benny; which I thoroughly enjoyed. Because really who doesn't love sriracha. Or eggs benedict. They have a good selection of healthy tasting juices which are a nice breakfast option. I will definitely be back here again.   They take coffee seriously - and they have decent beans from Square Mile. I have had some really good flat whites here - and some less so. When you have BrewLab round the corner you've got to be at the top of your game coffee-wise. They have only been open a couple months so hopefully things will become consistent.   Come here for brunch or for when you want a big space to sit with your laptop and drink some coffee and juice.",

This place was really close to my hotel so I'm surprised I didn't notice it as I walked past it sooner!  This place is definitely worth a stop if you are traveling here!",

Good sizes, good food, lovely atmosphere, a good place when you want a cup of coffee and quick lunch without any fuzz. Will definitely come back.",
