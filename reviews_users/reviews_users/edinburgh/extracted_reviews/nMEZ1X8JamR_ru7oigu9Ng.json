    "text": "This place leaves a lot to be desired. The burger was good but the place was not clean  and the music was deafening. The girl at  the cash was lovely and helpful. We ordered a cheeseburger bacon hot dog  2 fries coke and milk shake and it cost 31.50. I think that is shocking for a McDonald's type place. You line up to order and line up to pick up food. You eat from a bag. There are many places that you can sit and be served for that price. They also have the horrid practice of male female toilets. Single cubicles with washbasins but men all teaming around as you come out of the cubicle. Won't be back as it was overpriced and unpleasant",

As soon as I walked in I was deafened by the music playing and it was literally impossible to hear and be heared whrn ordering food. The girl was lovely behind the counter though but the food gets a big thumbs down from me, nit only was it expensive but I felt sick afterwards. I doubt I'll be returning. Very disappointing.",
