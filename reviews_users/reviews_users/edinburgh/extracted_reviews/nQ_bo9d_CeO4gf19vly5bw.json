    "text": "I think A-ok summs this up as far as delivered Thai food goes.  Tuesday-Thursday they have an offer of Starter, main and a side for 10 free delivery so last night Mrs and thought Life of Pi and a Thai had to be good as it rhymed.  I went for the fish cakes and the garlic & pepper chicken with noodles, Mrs had chicken skewers with Prawn Thai Green Curry, I for sure got the better side of this deal.  Stephs curry was watery, the prawns overcooked and the rice ok, my fish cakes with dipping sauce were acceptable and my chicken was succulent and had a good hit of taste, noodles were I have to say very tasty.  I guess A-ok is really for my meal, Mrs would probably say she has had better. All in all if you want a cheap meal its not bad but if you are looking for something really great as ever you will have to go elsewhere and pay for it. it was half the price of the take away we had from Ruan Thai and probably as good so take from that what you will.",

    "text": "We ordered two starters and two mains, which cost almost 30. For the price the food was not satisfying...   Part of the starter was cold, and the main dishes were even worse. The chicken wasn't cooked properly and the beef was chewy. The Jungle Curry came in an unappetizing thin sauce. Also, for the prize the size of the dishes was really tiny and therefore not adequate. The Chicken Wings priced 4.50 were three small wings. The four veggie spring rolls were soggy.  Getting in touch with the kitchen didn't help. The reply was that this is the normal portion size and the chicken is cooked under high pressure so some people might think it is undercooked. They were therefore only willing to repay the money for one starter, which I think wasn't really accommodating the issues we have experienced. Overall a sad performance and having tasted delicious Thai food in the past this was far from good. We were very disappointed and will not order again.",

    "text": "Well, this was disappointing! Our second visit to thaisanuk, we had intended to order green curry and pad thai both with tofu, but surprisingly they had run out of tofu, so we ordered both these dishes with vegetables instead (priced the same as with prawns, chicken or beef). The dishes arrived with a few slivers of vegetables floating in the curry and none noticeable in the pad thai.  We spoke to the waitress about the lack of vegetables, especially given the price relative to other dishes. She went away to talk to the chef and phoned the manager, and came back with an offer to remake the dishes with more vegetables. Whilst this might have been acceptable, the process had taken so much time that we had almost finished the wine and we were not in the mood to reset and start the meal again. So instead we offered to pay for one main course, which seemed reasonable given the lack of the central ingredient. There followed an indirect conversation with the manager relayed by the waitress, which ended with the comment from the manager that we would write a poor review and not return anyway, so we should just pay what we wanted.  The food had great flavour, but the bottom line for vegetarians is it is inadequate. Basically, the dishes serves are the standard base, without the addition of any meat (or tofu!) but at the same price. The manager was very disconnected from the situation, and unwilling to make things right by a small gesture. The waitress did well, though, despite the lack of support from her boss.  A shame, the food has potential but issues with how the restaurant is run.",

    "text": "If I could give 0 stars I would.  I have never had to leave a restaurant half way thru dining because the food is so bad before, but that is exactly what happened here tonight.   The food was dreadful. Really poor quality. Felt like they just didn't care what they served up to us. I imagine they had been to the Chinese supermarket and got some sauce packets, then went to Sainsburys and got some egg noodles, mixed them together and served. OK yes there was some chicken which I suppose there was not much wrong with but the veg were inexcusable. Giant chunks of boiled onion and big chunks of raw tomato have no place in a good Laksa. You've got to really be doing something wrong when the food is managing to be both tasteless and spicy.   Avoid at all costs. There are plenty of very good Thai places in Edinburgh, this place really needs to step it up. They would benefit from a trip to Celadon if they want to see how to do it right!",

    "text": "Loved this place when it was up Marchmont way.  Felt a bit like eating exotic food in your gran's front room and you could sup on a mighty fine wine without busting the bank thanks to the BYOB arrangement.   Somewhere in the transition to the new locale it's lost a bit of it's quirkiness and I think that's a real shame.   It's still BYOB, which isn't a bad thing as the soft drinks on offer are pretty pricey.  The food is decent -  the Laksa's fragrant and cooked to order in terms of heat, and the Vietnamese Pho noodles are a real winner.  Sadly as a sit in eatery it's just lacking in any atmosphere, which is probably why on a Friday evening at 8pm we were the only people left.  There was a bit more activity on the take-away side and I really hope this part of the business takes off.  Have to say the young woman working here was lovely and and I felt sorry she wasn't kept a bit busier, if only for the opportunity of more tips.   Definitely be back, but carry out option only I think.",

    "text": "Ordered food from here for dinner tonight. Well impressed. Delivery is free when you spend over a tenner (always a nice bonus). Pad thai was yummy and they didn't skimp on the prawns. Malaysian curry went down a treat, grapes and pineapples adds a slight sweetness to the curry which is great for the mister who isn't always so keen on spicy food. Massaman curry went down a treat, something slightly different to the green curry I normally order. Both currys had plenty of protein (chicken for him, beef for me).  The vietnamese chicken wings were yummy as well. Would definitely get food from here again!",

    "text": "I saw this place open recently and decided to try it thinking that's it's something to do with the other restaurant that used to be in Marchmont few years ago. Extremely disappointing experience! I don't think there was anything home made at all. In fact, everything tasted like a very poor quality readymade meals from a cash and carry. Not what you would expect from any restaurant. Dim Sum was saturated in fat and readymade fishcakes tasted like rubber (and was that even fish!). My partner ordered some beef skewers and the meat could have been anything. My Thaisanuk salad was made again of couple of bit of very cheap beef and very tired looking lettuce leaves. For some reason it was served with rice! The place was empty apart from one other table, but the waitress didn't come to check on us once. It took quite a while to get her attention. They also don't accept card payments. The only good thing about it is that it BYOB. Don't bother with this place. There is a much better Thai restaurant in Bruntsfield.",
