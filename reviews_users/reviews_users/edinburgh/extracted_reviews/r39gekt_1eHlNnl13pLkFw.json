Am so thrilled I have a Pret next door instead of walking to the branch in Hanover St .  The food and coffee is amazing , the range of food is overwhelming and the coffee just perfect !  Porridge or croissant for breakfast , are always made in premises and very fresh .",

    "text": "Love this chain. It provided good food at a very reasonable cost as we toured the UK.   This location has the same quality food as all the others, but looses a star for often being out of stock. I don't mean being out of stock on one or two items, but bare shelves with maybe one or two sandwiches selections remaining. Seems they allow the shelves to almost run bare before they start prepping another round of inventory. This happened several times to us as we were staying across the street at the Hilton.   On our last morning, i was certain to beat the rush and arrived at the store 15 minutes after they opened to find they had NO sandwiches - hot or cold - on the shelves. I asked a staff member and I was told that, \"Now that we are open, we should have them ready in about 30-45 minutes.\" What!?!?!?  Who waits until they are open to start stocking shelves?  Anyhow, good luck on the timing around this Pret a Manger location, but should you score a meal there, it will be as good as all the others!",

She did not inform me when she was done ringing me up or hand me a receipt so I was standing there until she made a hand gesture that my transaction was over.   The extra seating in the back is a large area. There is seating in the front of the cafe as well.   When we were here there was also a homeless man being escorted out of the cafe by two policemen. This cafe is in a good location off the royal mile!",
