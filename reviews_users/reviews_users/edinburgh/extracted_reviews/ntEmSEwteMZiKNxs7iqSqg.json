    "text": "The best chippy in Edinburgh - fact!!   We order from The Rig all the time and their food is consistently good. Their burgers are excellent and crisp , not soggy like most fish and chip shops. Their chips are perfectly cooked and they always give a generous amount whether it be regular or large. The fried pizza has a soft middle with crunchy sides , the way a fried pizza should be made. I can honestly say we have not had a bad meal from here and it is apparent that they put in the effort to deliver a great meal - also their delivery drivers are polite and courteous   The ONLY thing I can think of which is not good is the cost of their wine. 9 for a bottle of echo falls is not cool. They label on their menu as Chardonnay but they should really put the name of the wine   Apart from that small gripe , I cannot fault this chippy ... absolutely fantastic food and service - A+++++++",

    "text": "A hundred years ago my late wife and I bought our first flat near The Rig.  It was a monthly treat during poor times.  I'm back in the area and they popped a glossy menu through the door so I thought I'd try them again.  Oh, dear.  An hour for a delivery from a nearby chippy.  The food was cold and not particularly nice. They even managed to not put any butter on the buttered rolls.  With plenty of other chip shops in the air I won't be back.",
