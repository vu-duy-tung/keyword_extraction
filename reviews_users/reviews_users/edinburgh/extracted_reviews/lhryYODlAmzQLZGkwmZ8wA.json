    "text": "Mayfield Village is an amazing Chinese takeaway which has a good atmosphere, pleasant service, but incredible food.  I've been here twice and both times the meal was served in generous, filling portions and probably tasted better than any other Chinese I've been to.  The menu is extensive and has a full range of authentic Chinese dishes.  The first time I was in I went for the stir fried beef in black bean sauce with egg fried rice.  The staff were proper friendly and the order only took about five minutes to be cook.  I would have waited ten times as long for it because it just tasted so good!   The last time I was there I went for te salt and pepper squid which, again, was amazing.  Their prices are as you would expect with mains costing around 5.  If you're after top quality Chinese takeaway food then this is the place to come.",

    "text": "Of the many Chinese takeaways that are dotted around Edinburgh, this will always be my first choice. As a vegetarian - and a self-confessed picky eater! - I believe Mayfield Village offers the freshest and tastiest food. There is a stark difference in the taste of their food, when compared with other Chinese's I have gone to. If I have friends round for a takeaway, I will always use this one. And they will always comment on how nice the food was. I can't recommend it highly enough.",

    "text": "We tried this takeaway on a friends recommendationWe wish we had not bothered!! The spare ribs were tasty enough but the salt and chilli chicken wings were disappointingit was merely chicken wings roasted with some fried onion and chopped green chilli thrown over the top. My husbands special curry was absolutely tasteless and insipid looking. My duck with cashews had such an overpowering taste of five spice powder I could not eat it. Over and above the quality of food the prices are more expensive than most other places we have tried. We do not mind paying good money for a decent meal but this certainly was not one.",
