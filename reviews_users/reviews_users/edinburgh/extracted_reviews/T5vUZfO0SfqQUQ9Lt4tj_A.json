    "text": "Wow. I cannot believe this place exists in Edinburgh of all places. I really enjoyed my experience at Maki. I ordered the tonkostu black ramen and my boyfriend got the shoyu. Portions were fair and large. The noodles weren't my favorite (a bit too straight for me), but they were thick like I want them and the broth was really flavorful and comforting. I added a bunch of the spicy flakes and oil that were on the table already to my broth and it made it better. The soft-boiled egg is one of the most flavorful eggs I've had in a ramen. I gave the meat to my boyfriend and it seemed to be cooked well.   Shoyu broth was pretty good too. The flavor reminded me of roasted pork. We also got a sushi roll as an appetizer to share. A little pricey for a fairly standard roll, but it was made well so worth it. Prices on the ramens were reasonable too and what I normally pay in the U.S. Servers were friendly and came to talk to us during and after our meal so that was nice too. BONUS: They give you complimentary green tea for your table. It was necessary because the ramen noodles/broth made us SO full.",

    "text": "Surprisingly good find in the Fountainbridge area. Black garlic tonkatsu ramen on point. Waitress brought us fresh garlic that we grate ourselves. Big distraction was before we got our food-the sound of the uv fly zapper killing flies near the sushi bar. Otherwise, a good choice for some non-local food",

    "text": "I'm giving 3 stars for service. It seemed like there was no one around or available to take our order, check up on us or hand us the check. No one anticipated our needs. It took us 10 minutes to find a server to even look at us for the check.  As far as the food, the tonkotsu ramen was very rich. The chicken teriyaki bento box tasted more like bbq kebabs with a hint of Indian spice for some odd reason. It did not taste like Japanese teriyaki due to the lack of sauce. But the sides were an interesting combo. There was one piece of broccoli, kimchi, pickled cabbage and miso soup.  Overall, they should improve their service by anticipating the needs of their customers and be readily available.",

Water & green tea come as standard and the Post-it notes on which to doodle/write about your experience in the restaurant or whatever takes your fancy are a nice feature.  Service was good & the food at least as good as in the city's more established Japanese restaurants. Range of drinks is fine. Menus could though already do with a reprint due to a few crossings out.",
