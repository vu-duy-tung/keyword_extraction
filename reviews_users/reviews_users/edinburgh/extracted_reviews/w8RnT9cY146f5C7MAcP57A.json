    "text": "Sometimes I despair of Trinity - there's such a lack of decent places in the area! The Mulberry Bush is my last resort at lunch time when I have no other options (of which there are not many). It's really between a two and three star to be honest, because it's mostly a miss. But the baked potatoes are really very good so that is worth a mention.   Avoid most of the hot food - it all tastes like some kind of curry. I remember I once had stovies and it just about blew my head off with spice. Blergh! Oh, but then there's the macaroni and cheese, which tastes of nothing at all (??).  Good: baked potatoes, carrot/banana cake and falafel baguette. Bad: most of everything else.",

The black pudding was so hard it went in the bin. The 2 latte went down the sink. Foul ashtray tasting coffee. I Mulberry you goodbye.",
