    "text": "I highly recommend this place for a fresh generous portion of salad. For 4.25 you get a \"small\" salad with a large selection of items to toss together. They also offer sandwiches, tortillas, and other stuff.   Much like anywhere else in old town, there's going to be a long line during the fringe. It's still worth the wait if you're eager to add some vegetables to your diet after a couple of days of eating haggis, blood pudding, and meat pies.",

    "text": "Thanks to my fellow Yelpers for suggesting this place.  We stopped off here from our Hop On and Off bus for a quick bite and coffee after visiting Edinburgh Castle.    The staff, the young college/university type were ever so friendly and accommodating and the food was quick, tasty and affordable.  There is some seating, but limited.  We had our baby with us and were able to get a table for a quick break on our day out of touring the wonderful city.    On a separate note, beware of the (non related) cheese stand at the nearby Grassmarket outdoor market, the guy ripped me off for a measly bit of cheese, but I was able to eat it with some bread they kindly gave me at Graze haha",

    "text": "This is a lovely and super healthy deli bar! They have a range of ingredients from which you can customise your own salad box, sandwich or ciabatta. The options include your typical fair as well as some really nice tasty things like roast veg, falafel, hummus, kale, quinoa, spiced cauliflower etc. as well as the meat like chicken, ham and turkey. There are three salad box sizes from around 4.95 to 6.95, and they allow you to fill it literally to the brim. I find that the medium is enough for a good filling meal, the large is pretty massive and could probably accommodate one of everything. They also have soup on the menu, and are very vegan and vegetarian friendly.  The seating is limited, but everything is served take-away style and there is outdoor seating as well. The prices are very good for the large servings, and this cafe is perfect if you are looking for somewhere healthy and quick in the heart of Edinburgh.",

They have a wide selection of salads and veggies to choose - capsicum, onions, cauliflowers, roasted vegetables, herbs, kale, spinach, rice, sweet potato, meats and many more. You can choose the ingredients and create your own salad box or wraps. They have 3 sizes of salad boxes - min, small and large. Very healthy and delicious too! I got a small salad box made for 4.95 and it tasted good and fresh. Good value for the money spent. They also have some breakfast specials and breakfast boxes special for  5.95 which includes toast too. Highly recommend this place.",

Together with other things that are not too green and crunchy, if you like! They have a great deal for a salad box, very reasonably priced with tons of options that you can put in, including greens, pastas, veggies, pre-prepared salads, and toppings like onions, rice, beets, peppers, etc. The staff are very friendly and helpful. They also have a breakfast deal with a very good price for a breakfast sandwich and coffee. Know that the breakfast sandwich is huge and could probably feed two people or be taken with you for lunch as well! Huge amount of eggs and bacon. They do close on the early side so be aware to get in before they close if you want dinner!",

    "text": "High yield: This was the only breakfast place open at the hours we were trying to catch our morning buses to our tours. So props to them for being open this early. It had very warm hospitality that makes up for its somewhat eerie neon green lighting, a good breakfast menu and deal and is super convenient (breakfast box for 5$ or 3 items and coffee for 3.75)  Deals: 5/5 for taste, price, and quality  Breakfast Box is 5 breakfast side items, comes with toast. for 5$- good for to go for travel if you're in a rush or need to bring it back to your hotel. In my opinion this is the BEST deal for breakfast on this whole Grassmarket district.  Breakfast trio: for 3.75$ you can get 3 breakfast side items and comes with toast and coffee/ tea. this is a mini version of the Breakfast box, but for those who did not want to go full heartiness.  Breakfast items:  Haggis: it's a lamb hash brown thing with some veggies- very good if you want the full Scottish meal experiece Potato scone: For those who like carbs- it's kinda bread like and has potatoes in it. If you're someone who gets full on bread fast, I don't recommend this but it's otherwise good.  Eggs- I honestly asked for sunny side up the next day, because their scrambled is super super fluffy to the point where it's like custard and tofu like. Sunny Side up is more like over and easy.  Sausage links- I recommend these- pretty large and the flavor you can't go wrong.  Hash brown- get it. It's good.  Tomatoes/Mushrooms- for those who want some veggies in their combo, definitely get these two.   Service: I felt that a lot of people in Edinburgh were just going through the motions of serving just for the sake of it rather than actually caring much for the guests. I felt this place made conversation, was patient, and was genuinely concerned for the travelers that pass through. So with that I give them a 5/5 for service.",

I'm so glad I decided to take a quick stroll instead of opting for the usual premade sainsburys salad!  I have really been missing a good salad place since leaving San Francisco. Might be the only thing that Edinburgh lacks. But Graze has filled that void! For 4.95, I got a large salad box, and was able to build my own lunch. There's a big glass case display with all the ingredients available. At first I just asked for spinach, some egg, tomato, and onion. The employee then asked \"Are you sure? You have a ton more room in here.\" So then I went a little crazy and added roasted vegetables, sun dried tomato, cajun chicken, kale, cucucmber and even more veggies. I was amazed at the amount of food that fits inside the large salad box. I was only able to eat about half for lunch, and the rest was my dinner! Such a deal.   And it's not just the quantity of food that I appreciated for the price - but the quality as well! Super tasty, everything looked fresh, really quality ingredients.   I had my salad for take away but there are a few tables and chairs if you'd rather sit in.   Overall, really nice and quick service, awesome location, fantastic price, and delicious food.",

Fresh, responsibly sourced healthy food which is very affordable and very well-portioned.  I always try to get a different mix when I come, and as that's at different times of the day it's easy to do. If they run out of something fresh that day then you'll miss out on it for that day. Staff are very friendly too, and whilst there is often a queue here, which you do have to wait in for quite a while - if say it's worth the wait!  The arrancini are delicious, and the baked potato was amazing (yes I know it's just a baked lot at but it really was delicious!)  This is the perfect place to go to for lunch! Wish there was a little more seating, but if it's sunny you can simply sit out in the square!",
