    "text": "The John McIntyre Centre or JMC, is the canteen area for Pollock Halls students who are at the university on a catered basis. However, it is also possible for members of the public to purchase a one off ticket that allows entry to the canteen. Ordinarily students are granted entry to the buffet style canteen with ID confirming that they have paid for the catered option. I used the JMC during my first year at university. You often hear of people moaning at how disgusting an inedible the food is, but this is simply not True. The food is not the greatest, but it does allow you to have a good nutritional meal. There is plenty of salad available and fruit juice and plenty of a variety of fruits such as oranges, bananas and apples. There is also an \"unhealthy\" option if you so choose offering pizza and chips. I went to the JMC before it was refurbished but have subsequently returned by purchasing a one-off ticket and the layout is not much better, and the seating arrangement is a lot less prison-y with round tables rather than long regimented tables. Further, the layout of the food is also a lot neater and there are even more options to choose from, especially in regards to the salad.",
