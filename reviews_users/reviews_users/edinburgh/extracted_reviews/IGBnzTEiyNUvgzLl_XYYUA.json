I was part of a 3-hour Food Tasting Tour in Edinburgh, Scotland (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsecretfoodtours.com&s=e00ab9eff7c7ad7938f0b4a7868dda71a0c5e034285d59a5cdd4c0e926c3877c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">secretfoodtours.com</a>).  We stopped here for lentil soup and traditional tea.  The soup was very good, thick, and with a very nice texture. Well seasoned and flavorful.  The teas was good as well. It was accompanied with freshly made scones. I got hooked with tea when I went to England like 6 years ago.",

One star because of the service was subpar, the Turkish mint tea we ordered was like water, and the bathroom had no toilet paper. Feel free to avoid this place. There are equally cute and much tastier options.",

    "text": "This little cafe on St. Mary's is the perfect stop for a cappuccino or latte and some brunch. We ordered the veggie Scottish breakfast and the halloumi pesto panini. Portions were generous and food was delicious, especially the veggie breakfast. While it was raining when we ate here, there is a patio off the back of the cafe that looks very cute and cozy. Great spot to stop!",

The outdoor terrace is nice in fair weather and a peaceful retreat from the bustling streets. The interior has casual tables and happy atmosphere.  Just what we were looking for as an alternative to the pub fare we had enjoyed the day before.",

    "text": "We went for breakfast and were disappointed. The prices are quite high for what you get e.g. 6 for toast and 2 eggs. What was worse is that we ordered chorizo and avocado toast but it came without avocados and they only told us when we commented that they were out of them. Also the eggs were all hard and the coffee wasn't great. However the setting is nice and very central and the staff were pleasant. They did give us a small discount which was appreciated. Maybe it's better for lunch/dinner but I'd choose somewhere else for breakfast",
