    "text": "Considering this place is on the top 10 best restaurants in Edinburgh, I was pretty disappointed.    When we arrived we informed the staff that we were waiting on one other person to join us but she had been pulled into a meeting last minute so would let them know within 10 minutes whether she was able to make it or not.  When we told them that she couldn't make it they made a huge song and a dance about clearing one set of cutlery and one glass off the table, their huffing and puffing was the only atmosphere in the restaurant!  Honestly, if any of the waiting staff cracked a smile I think their faces would have broken!!!    That does seem quite harsh considering how good the food was however good service counts for so much to any night out!    The food was lovely - bursting with flavours, decent amount without being any wasted and the presentation was delightful as most plates were decorated with edible flowers.  I tried Song Pi Nong - Two Brothers and Koo Saneha - A Loving couple which were delicious but at 7.95 and 9.50 for starters it isn't cheap!!!    I went in a big group and everyone had a different main course.  I can't remember what everyone had however there wasn't a dish that was disappointing.  Each was scrumptious in their own right.    All in all, this place would be great if they did take aways but I won't be rushing back anytime soon as I think that there are restaurants out there that are just as good, cheaper in fact and serve their customers with a friendly smile!",

I found it quite hard to compare with our other recent Thai quest, when we visited Siam Thani, as the two places are very different. I imagine this reflects both the diversity of Thai cuisine, and the differing approaches of the owners and chefs. I think both places merit a further visit, as I having a feeling that their evening menus are where they both shine more brightly. For sure, pay Dusit a visit, soon. You'll be very pleased with what you're served and how you're served it.\"",

Off the beaten track, but what a wee hidden gem of a place. Was told about this place by a work colleague. It is tiny but quaint and cosy. The staff are amazing. The scallops are to die for and the green curry is one of the best I have ever tasted. Would highly recommend the black rice pudding and coconut ice cream. It is relatively pricey but worth every penny.",

    "text": "Dusit really is a very safe, very delicious bet for quality Thai food. A friend of mine has sworn by Dusit takeaways for years, and after listening to one too many boasting phone calls from her as she dined away smugly on her Thai meals, I decided it was time to have a break away from my faithful Indian takeaway meals, and sample some Dusit flavour.  It would never have entered my head to book a meal at a Thai restaurant, before I actually visited Thailand and realised how absolutely amazing the food is. I think I just spent quite a few years making the same meal every evening (pasta, tuna, bit of Parmesan, winner) and being too lazy to be imaginative about what I put in my chops. After having coconut soup or Tom Kha most days I was in Thailand, I put Dusit to the test and ordered the seafood Tom Kha, and was super excited when it made me feel like I was back on the beach in Ko Tao, even though in reality I was freezing my socks off in Edinburgh.   Dusit has a really interesting menu, with a mix of contemporary and traditional, and my friends and I got slightly over excited, ordering enough food to feed a large wedding party. Every single dish was flavourful, with just that right level of spice that doesn't leave you crying into your food, although I know some people like that.   Be prepared to book ahead on any day of the week, as the restaurant is fairly small, and being really popular with locals, it fills up quickly.",

    "text": "There is absolutely no denying that the menu in Dusit is one of the most innovative and interesting around. The fusion of Scottish produce and authentic Thai flavours bring something a bit different to the Scottish palate that is accustomed to fried food.  What I will say about Dusit is that the food is healthy and flavoursome. Perhaps it was just the mood I was in when I visited, but I really didn't feel like it filled me up, and I left actually quite hungry. The staff weren't the nicest either, and I waited a while on a drink, and had to ask for it again. I felt like they thought I was a bit of an inconvenience and I hate that feeling.  I'm not very eloquent when it comes to the Thai lingo, nor am I very experienced when it comes to Thai meals, so I decided (mainly due to my ignorance) to go for the Dusit curry, which is sirloin steak in a 'mysterious' red curry sauce. The menus description, not mine. It waas a pricey dish at almost 15, so I hoped it would live up to my expectations. It came, stunningly presented, and smelt beautiful, but the taste lacked punch and I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was. Perhaps it just isn't to my taste, but I was actually quite disappointed. To their absolute credit though, I don't ever order red meat, and the steak was cooked perfectly to my requirements, so massive kudos for that.  Next time, I shall be a little more adventurous and perhaps try a sea-food dish, even if I have to point to it on the menu!",

What makes Dusit stand out is the spicing. Every dish has great depth of flavour, and a good amount of heat - which makes a pleasant change from the bland-tasting curries you get at many Thai restaurants in the UK.   On our last visit we were a group of 18 - and I can honestly say that the quality of service was as good as when we have visited as a group of 4.   Highly recommended!",

It's on Thistle Street which is a nice little street that runs between George STreet and Queen STreet - lots of cute little shops and restaurants hidden away here.   Dusit has a large, varied menu, has all the staples you would expect as well as some more unusual dishes. It's served in nice simple crockery that really shows off the food nicely. Tasty food in plentiful portions.   My only complaint is that the restaurant can get very noisy - the floor is tiled and it really echos the sound around - if there is a big party in then not the place for a romantic meal.",

    "text": "The best Thai restaurant I have tried in Edinburgh located on Thistle St which is fast becoming my favourite street in Edinburgh (due to its quirky bars and restaurants which are much more chilled out than nearby George and Rose St). Dusit is very cosy and has a great selection of unusual Scottish twists on Thai dishes (eg venison curries and scallop noodles). The staff are very friendly and always make you feel so welcome. Dusit is always busy so you should book any night of the week. It is more expensive than most Thai restaurants in Edinburgh but the premium price is justified by the top quality food and service. It can be noisy however as it is always so busy. They now have a private dining room open downstairs which is perfect for groups of about 8 people.  Top tip - If you ask in advance and have a party of more than 6 people (I think) the chef will prepare a banquet meal for c.25 per head which means your table will be served the chef's selection of starters and main courses so you can try a bit of everything - a great way to sample the menu.",

I was very disappointed on several counts. Firstly, we felt very rushed - no sooner had we sat down than they tried to take our order, in fact another three times before we had actually decided - I'd say that is the opposite of good service. The tables are so close together to get as many in as possible that it is impossible not to be involved in other people's conversation! The table next to us was 6 inches away! We asked for water immediately on arrival and it still hadn't come by the end of our main course - of course the wine which was expensive came immediately! The staff did not give off an air of relaxation, very sloppy when clearing the table crumbs just wiped onto the floor and sauce from one of our dishes dripped across the table. Our starters were less than adequate, the chicken on skewers (satay) was only just warm and greasy. The prawns in batter were absolutely tasteless and soggy. The main courses were nothing startling. My husband had his wine topped up twice by one of the female waitresses without me even being asked - - I was asked the next time by one of the waiters ....also the glasses were not particularly clean. We normally go to the Thai Orchid where the food and calm, gentle and courteous service along with the exceptional quality of the food and wine never disappoints and both my husband and I have recommended it to many people who have shared our opinion barr none. Will not spend my money at the Dusit again....a big let down.",

    "text": "The Thai food here is great! Dusit shines as an oasis in Edinburgh. I must admit, I wanted to experience Scottish food when I arrived but I found everything else to be...disappointing. Dusit was the very last restaurant I ate at in my trip to Edinburgh and boy was I glad I found it. Unlike Scottish food there is actually FLAVOR. I could believe my taste buds after a week of disappointment in other various restaurants.  My companion and I bought the banquet dinner (essentially like a tasting menu) and the portions were HUGE! You get this enormous platter for a starter filled with various rolls, dumplings and skewers as well as a spicy beef salad. Try not to fill up as you get a choice of 3 mains and these are also pretty large too! I thought they would decrease the size of the mains because of the selection process but nope, each one was in their own right a single entree size! We chose the crispy chicken, the duck and the spicy beef (that was probably the spiciest thing on the menu).  Everything was delicious and the spice was completely manageable. I was actually a bit hesitant initially because I was the ONLY asian customer in that restaurant at the time that I went. Usually, that is a really bad sign of westernized asian food that tends to be less spicy and blander. But that wasn't the case at all and I thought it was all so very delicious.  I also ordered a Thai iced tea and to my surprise you get to add your own amount of sweet syrup and condensed milk. That's great because you can customize the Thai iced tea to your liking!  I loved the decor and the seating arrangements (plenty of space between tables). The staff were michelin star-d attentive. I have never seen staff in an asian restaurant as attentive as these. They cater to your every need and was always on hand to refill your wine or water glass.  This restaurant is a diamond in the rough and a must try if you come to Edinburgh!",

My fellow diners equally enjoyed their choices, though if you have a 'tummy problem' I would highly recommend staying of anything labeled 'spicy' - as that will be a correct indication.   We had some left overs and they were packed to take home with us. I really enjoyed that the day after!  As noted in a different review, we sat just behind a big stag party and we had difficulty understanding eachother. That was a bit of a downer, as we were there on our own celebration and unwillingly being pulled into someboday else's is .. well.. crap.  This is not the restaurant's fault per se, but it does reflect on the experience we had.   Nonetheless I regard Dusit as one of the best Thai restaurants in Edinburgh.",

You like you're going to be great, the menu confirms this, the wine draws you in further and then the food and the service is somehow just lacking a little bit.  Not the most constructive feedback I know but I dont really feel much more about it that this, its ok...not bad...but not great.",

    "text": "Bland bland bland bland bland.   What a disappointment after wanting to eat here for years! Nice enough place but the food is terribly bland and flavourless. Just average Thai food that you could get in any other restaurant or indeed local takeaway.  My starter was the real let down. I had a Thai beef salad, named \"Tiger Cry\", which, according to the menu, is \"attributed to the small red bird's eye chillies in the sauce that are hot enough to bring tears to the tiger's eyes.\" I was actually worried that this was a risky choice as authentic Thai food is renowned for being ridiculously spicy.  Well, I think those tiger eyes need glasses as there was no chilli in this dish. I'm not saying there wasn't much chilli, I'm saying there was no chilli. At all. I excavated the entire dish and didn't find a single shred. And there wasn't much other flavour going on either. The beef was pleasant but had none of the nice Thai flavours I expected. Where was the lemongrass, the galangal, the lime, the fish sauce, the TASTE?  My main was Pad Thai which is a bit of a boring choice but I love it and it's a good dish to compare across restaurants. It was quite nice but again not particularly spicy or sour, therefore no better than any I've had elsewhere.  The setting is ok but the tables are rather packed in, and the service was stiff and borderline unfriendly. Neither of these would normally bother me if the food is good but paying high prices for food I could get at a takeaway makes me wonder what I'm paying for. Chaophraya has a stunning setting and friendly service so if I want Westernised Thai food I'll go there.",

    "text": "Pretty standard choice for Thai in New Town but here's the warning label just so you're prepared:  1) Beware the noise - it's always busy and even if you're not loud when you come in, some acoustic quirk means you soon will be to be heard above the base level din (intimate tables for two may be better off elsewhere) 2) Starters are mostly overpriced - focus on the more generous mains  3) The waiters don't smile, though I think they aaalmost cracked this time when my very English dining buddy tried pronouncing the dishes in a Thai accent.   I'll probably be back to satisfy my Thai cravings when I'm next up north plus there's huge variety on the menu; if you can handle the above then it's worth a try too :)",

    "text": "Had a really nice birthday dinner here after drinks next door at the Bon Vivant.  The interior is modern and casually elegant - you don't have to dress up to eat here but you certainly could!  We started with some red wine, and the Tiger Cry - a salad of barbecued beef that was allegedly so spicy it would bring tears to a tiger's eyes!  That may have been pushing it a bit - there was certainly spice involved, but nothing we couldn't handle with ease.  Lots of great sweet-salty Thai flavor, however.  We got the Bangkok Duck, crispy and dripping with deliciously sweet sticky sauce.  It was a very large portion (for Europe, anyway!) and along with the Talay Sam Rod, we had a very large, beautiful meal!  The Talay Sam Rod is a fish dish - char grilled monkfish, scallops, and prawns, in a beautiful sauce with tamarind, kaffir lime, and Thai basil (which was a lovely, herbal accompaniment).  Seafood was perfectly cooked - I can still taste taht scallop!  Both were delicious with the fragrant coconut rice.  Could not finish, though we gave it a valiant effort!  Quite busy on a Saturday night at 7 pm, so I'd make a reservation at the weekend for sure.  This place is relaxed and inexpensive enough that you could justify going anytime, but it's also elegant enough to go there on a special night.  I'd say it's perfect for people like us, two poor kids with something to celebrate!",

I visited with my mum, and everything we had was bursting with flavour. I find with a lot of Thai places that chillies substitute flavour, but in this case it was both spice and nice! I had the Tom Yum soup followed by the grilled king prawns and Pad Thai for the main. The portions were nice and big so you got a good amount for your pennies. The place had a great atmosphere, with low ceilings and oodles of character!  Go go go!",

    "text": "Hmm, I'm lost to understand the high praise for Dusit, as it left me feeling very much wanting, and I was so disappointed in that. For what was delivered, it was overpriced and varying in quality. The place was absolutely heaving (Friday night and we hadn't booked anywhere), but we were kindly shown to a table so long as we vacated by 9pm. No problem, and we were happy that we were accommodated.   The restaurant, hot damn, I have never been in a place so noisy that I can't hear myself talk. It was full to the brim and just seemed that the acoustics were nicely setup to cause a constant sound of bedlam. I literally couldn't hear half of what the SR was saying, and we lapsed into silence for most of the meal. It felt rushed, with someone coming past our table every few minutes, asking us for an order, or delivering up food. For drinks, I had a very average Merlot (only two reds for sale by the glass, so options limited), and the boy knocked back a couple of lemonades.   The boy and I shared fish cakes and popia. The popia were nicely stuffed, more filling than batter, and the fish cakes were pleasant. We followed this up with duck with choo chi and pad prig ti dumm (monkfish, king prawns and scallops). I had thrown caution to the wind and gone for one of the pricier options on the menu, but the lightly spiced monkfish sounded too delicious.   And this was where the problem was, it wasn't delicious. It was nice. It wasn't spicy - flavoursome and nicely cooked (scallops were pretty close to tender), yes, but not spicy and the flavours, well, they just weren't very elegant or interesting. The SR seemed to enjoy his duck, but in the same, deflated, 'oh, is that it?' kind of way. My dish also had some random squid that I didn't really want in there as well. We had ordered some pad mee on the side - which had the consistency of super noodles - and some roti. The more I ate, the more I realised I didn't want to. When the waiter came round to start emptying our table i.e. push all the remaining noodles onto our plates - I said no. I also don't like having someone else serving food onto my plate. So instead, all the food was heaped onto the SR's plate. It didn't exactly give me the option to return for more noodles later.  Overall, it felt rushed and we didn't really enjoy our meals. To be honest, it overall came out as feeling all very average. Average food, average wine. Service - too hassled and rushed - by the time the main course arrived my stomach was in knots and I was feeling pretty anxious - not relaxed at all. Surroundings are way way way too noisy - need to seriously dampen acoustics in there - and price was seriously excessive of quality. In all honesty, I think this is the first Thai restaurant I've visited where I've been disappointed, and that's a shame - I can't think of a point where Dusit really scored well, bar some well cooked scallops and that really isn't enough to inspire me to return.",

Although I know it's possibly the best street for restaurants and bars in Edinburgh, for some reason it somehow falls off my radar everytime I head out for a bite to eat. So it was with great excitement that a group of us headed to Dusit for lunch.  The first thing that struck me was the good value of the lunch menu. for just over 12 a head we were given a starter (there was no supplementary charge for the big juicy prawns, either), a delicious main, and a big steaming plate of sticky rice.   The food was utterly delicious, and the fact that the place was packed to the rafters on a Monday lunchtime made me glad that my companions had thought ahead far enough to book a table.   I will definitely be back, and am already planning a return journey with my other half (I think I made him jealous by going on and on and on about it when I got home...)",

    "text": "Dropped in as I was walking past from the gym back towards the flat thinking what shall I eat. Given its January im trying to be good with food choices and Thai appealed. I haven't been in Dusit for about 8 years and I have to say I've missed out. By chance got a window table so had loads of room and other than a couple working out how much they get away with on expenses pretty much had my own space. The rest of the restaurant is set back and was busy for a Wednesday night.   Kept it simple by having vegetable roles for starter and they were fresh and very tasty. And they are generous in portion size too. For mains I went with pad prig tai dumm which is spicy prawns, scallops and monkfish set in a lovely sauce and I had a portion of steamed rice and a glass of kiwi Sauvignon blanc to help it down. I'd earned it and I'm not doing completely dry January :) the prawns were perfect and you got a good few. The scallops were also done well, not too dry not too fishy. You get a decent amount of fish and this was that great balance of being meaty but still fish as monkfish should be. The sauce was spicy and you got a good amount of lemongrass to chew on if the mood takes you. I'm not the biggest fan of really spicy/hot food and I found this just right and as their menu says 'a small hint of fiery spice' does make the dish work. Veg was also done right balancing flavour with firmness.   So it's not cheap, this was a bit of a luxury for a man who wasn't using his expenses account but I was not disappointed. It would have been 5 stars but it is on the pricey side but on balance you get what you pay for. There are many Thai restaurants in and about the new town and this one Is top of the list for me. Service was prompt and courteous which lets be honest is pretty standard for any decent Thai restaurant as the service ethic is so natural. Reading other reviews I know I was lucky not being in the main body of the restuarant as a noisy group can dominate that part of the restaurant and you could be unlucky. However It will not be another 8 years before I'm back.",

I went for dinner here and we were seated promptly even though we turned up a little early. I was very surprised at how busy it was, there was not a spare table anywhere, on a Thursday night?! Always a good sign I think!   The menu is extensive and there is certainly enough choice to make it difficult to choose! I ended up going for taro and sweet potato fritters with sweet chilli sauce, when they arrived they weren't what I had imagined, but in a good way! The portion was generous and came with a very pretty looking side salad which I chose not to destroy. It was the flower, it looked to nice!   I then chose King Prawn stir fry with asparagus, green beans, pak choi in an oyster sauce, and we shared a coconut rice. The stir fry was delish, everything was perfectly cooked and yet again the portion was very generous! I struggled to finish it, but enjoyed every mouthful.  Service was brilliant, the staff are very welcoming, efficient and do not rush you at all. I had a lovely night here, but I would say it is maybe a little pricey to go every night but I would highly recommend it!",
