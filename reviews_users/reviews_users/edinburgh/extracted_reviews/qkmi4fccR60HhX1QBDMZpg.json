We had the Mo Mo chicken appetizer, spicy pappadom, and pickel tray, all delicious choices to start. My husband had the lamb leg, which was absolutely divine and so tender. I had the chicken biryani, which was also wonderful. We had the date and ginger naan along with our meals. All in all, we couldn't rate this place higher. Our waiter/manager/owner was also very nice. Eat here!",
