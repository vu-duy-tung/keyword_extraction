    "text": "It's great.  Good food at great prices, the service is the best feature. Family run and super friendly. They know me by name, and occasionally, as I pop-in for a take away after my late shift at work, they give me a free beer for my returned custom. So nice. They have great offers on three course sit-in menu.. something like 8.95 Sun to Thur.  It's shut on Mondays, but everyone deserves a rest after all their hard work.",
